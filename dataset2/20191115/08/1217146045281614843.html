      <p>A silly phishing campaign is underway where the attackers state that your password will expire and be changed unless you login and confirm that you want to keep it the same.</p>
      <p>As people get better at spotting the phishing scams pretending to be shipping information, receipts, and voicemails, scammers need to come with new methods to get people to click the links in their emails.</p>
      <p>Such is the case with a new phishing email that states you need click on the "Keep same password" button or your password will expire.</p>

      <p>The full text of this phishing email is below.</p>
      <pre>Your account xxx@example.com password expires today 11/11/2019 6:26:44 a.m. <br/><br/>Please kindly use the button below to continue with the same password <br/><br/>  Keep same password   <br/><br/>NOTE :   This is a one time user verification carried out in purpose to provide a more secured platform and shut down robot or malicious users created in purpose of  spamming and other fraudulent activities .  <br/><br/>Copyright Â© 2019 example.com security management <br/></pre>
      <p>Of course, once you click on the "Keep same password" link you will be brought to a page asking you to login to your mail server.</p>

      <p>Once you so, though, the attackers will now have your login credentials and be able to access your email account.</p>
      <p>They can then perform BEC scams or take over other accounts that you use under the same email address.</p>
      <p>As always, if you find a suspicious email related to your email accounts or login credentials, always contact your system administrator before clicking on any links in the emails you receive.</p>
