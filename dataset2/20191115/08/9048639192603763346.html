      <p>OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- An Oklahoma judge who last summer ordered consumer products giant Johnson &amp; Johnson to pay $572 million to help address the state's opioid crisis is reducing that amount by $107 million in his final order in the case.</p>
      <p>District Judge Thad Balkman on Friday issued the order directing the company to pay the state $465 million, acknowledging that he miscalculated in his original award how much it would cost to develop a program for treating babies born addicted to opioids. The cost should have been $107,000, not $107 million.</p>
      <p>The judge declined a request by the defendants to further reduce the amount to take into account pre-trial settlements totaling $355 million the state reached with Oxycontin-maker Purdue Pharma and Israeli-owned Teva Pharmaceuticals.</p>
      <p>Attorneys for Johnson &amp; Johnson say the company plans to appeal.</p>
