      <h1>Russia to deliver S-400 missiles to India as planned: Putin</h1>

      <p><b>BRASILIA: </b>Russia plans to deliver S-400 surface-to-air missile systems to India on schedule, President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>India agreed to buy the S-400 system from Russia last year despite US warnings the purchase could trigger sanctions against it.</p>
      <p>India said it needed the weapons to bolster its defences against China.</p>
      <p>“As far as the S-400 deliveries are concerned, everything is<br/>going according to plan. Our Indian colleagues have not asked to<br/>speed anything up, it’s all going fine,” Putin told reporters at<br/>a summit of BRICS countries in Brazil.</p>
