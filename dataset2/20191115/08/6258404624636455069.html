      <p>Anyone who missed the X019 show and wants to catchup will appreciate that Microsoft is going over everything it announced at the event. Among the good news is that there are 21 titles from developers in the ID@Xbox program that will launch day one with <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a> and Project xCloud. One of the best announcements was a new survival game called "Grounded" from Obsidian.</p>
      <p>This is a new Xbox Game Preview title that will launch in the Spring of 2020 with Xbox Game Pass. The game looks a lot like the movie "Ants" or "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids." "Grounded" is a survival game where the players have been shrunken down and must survive the wild world of the backyard complete with bugs and spiders that want to kill you. The game has narrative and RPG elements, and it looks very cool.</p>

      <p>Rare announced a new game called "Everwild." Little was shared about the game with a promise for more information later. The trailer reminds a lot of the live-action "Snow White and the Huntsman" movie. Sea of Thieves fans will get to play Seabound Soul and Fire, which is the latest free monthly update starting November 20. It will bring new ammo and quests for players to enjoy.</p>
