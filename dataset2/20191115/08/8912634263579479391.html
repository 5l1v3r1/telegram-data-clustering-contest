      <p>JERUSALEM: Israel says it has completed a series of airstrikes on targets linked to the Islamic Jihad militant group in Gaza after rocket fire that rattled a day-old truce.<br/>The military statement early on Friday indicates that Israel is willing to abide by the cease-fire if there are no additional rocket attacks.<br/>The statement says Israel struck a military compound, a rocket-manufacturing site and a militant headquarters in the town of Khan Younis.<br/>The airstrikes came after a barrage of rockets late Thursday. There were no immediate reports of casualties on either side.<br/>It’s unclear whether the fighting would continue. The unofficial cease-fire that began early Thursday ended a two-day escalation triggered by Israel’s targeted killing of an Islamic Jihad commander.<br/>The fighting killed 34 Palestinians, including 16 civilians.</p>
