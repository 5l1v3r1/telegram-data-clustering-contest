      <h1>Social media followers take up Fani-Kayode over Dakolo-Fatoyinbo rape tweet</h1>

      <p>Social media followers of ex-Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode, have taken an umbrage at his tweet on the outcome of the suit of Mrs. Busola Dakolo, alleging rape by the Pastor/Founder of the Commonwealth of Zion Assembly, Biodun Fatoyinbo.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Dakolo had alleged that Fatoyinbo raped her in her parents’ house when she was a teenager.</p>
      <p>In its judgment, a Federal Capital Territory High Court sitting in Bwari on Thursday dismissed Mrs. Dakolo’s suit, and also ordered her to pay N1m for wasting the court’s time.</p>
      <p>Taking to his verified Twitter handle @realFFK in the aftermath of the judgment on Thursday, Fani-Kayode had tweeted:</p>

      <p>The tweet has since attracted different reactions from his Twitter followers.</p>
      <p>See some of the reactions as tweeted:</p>
      <p><b>Martins Chika @martinschikaa:</b> Dear Sir, but if you blame the Nigerian courts for giving a false judgement to to Buhari against Atiku, why do you now believe they gave a just Judgement in this case? Don’t things seem to be about firm, position &amp; money in 9ja? I don’t like to go into such matters</p>
      <p><b>@terwasemurph:</b> Don’t mind uncle FFK. He wants to be correct at all times.</p>
      <p><b>Olugbenga Oyelakin @Olugben97811194:</b> But Sir, when the Court ruled in favor of Buhari against Atiku, You said Buhari might have won the judgement of this world but not the heaven’s. Are you trusting our Judiciary on this case but not on the presidential elections?</p>
      <p><b>Godson Greene Kpodo @godsongreene_:</b> I’m so shocked hearing that from him. To say it’s a mere accusation without hard credible evidence or that it didn’t happen. I feel so ashamed of African blood.</p>
      <p><b>alex ogaga @twitlayzie285:</b> He wasn’t vindicated..Let’s not turn facts on its head..D case&amp;its actual substance was never entertained&amp;deliberated upon by D courts..It was knocked out by the ‘Technicality’ termed Statute barred which means D window within which she should have filed a case has since elapsed</p>
      <p><b>IBIAM @official_ibiam:</b> Just like FFK would say of others, Biodun Fatoyinbo may have been “vindicated” by the court of man but certainly not in the court of God.</p>
      <p><b>Anna Alexander Caiafas @acaiafas:</b> Lol! The law doesn’t take away the truth.; since we say we re Christians we will all reap what we sow!</p>
      <p><b>Bella Agbons A.K.A Mummy Igwe @AngelAgbons:</b> so because there is no evidence that means he is innocent? don’t worry he will soon enter trap like that Sex for grade man. Mtcheeeeeew</p>
      <p><b>OMERE EKPENEDE @omere_ekpenede:</b> So because Fatoyinbo won,the court is wonderful, when APC wins you insult the courts,I don’t know if Fatoyinbo is guilty or not,but the court in Nigeria as it is will not clear his name</p>
      <p><b>Uncle P @uncle_pee01:</b> Even you that is a lawyer is misinterpreting a very simple judgment that a 200 level law student would interpret.</p>
      <p><b>De Empress @Chinyereugo_042:</b> Am not with you on this one Sir, because i have lost fate in Nigeria judiciary. Am not supporting anyone here but i believe that no secret remains hidden forever.</p>
