      <h2>Bastien Palmier, 30, ignored warning signs and ventured onto the edge of the Na Mueang 2 waterfall in Thailand, where he slipped and fell onto sharp rocks below</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T08:30:42+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 08:30</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Kitching, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/chris-kitching/</a></address>
      <p>A holidaymaker slipped and fell to his death while trying to take a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/selfies">selfie</a> at a beauty spot where he allegedly ignored warning signs.</p>
      <p>Bastien Palmier, 30, and a friend were visiting a 260ft high waterfall on the island of Koh Samui in Thailand when he tragically died on Thursday morning.</p>
      <p>The friend said the French tourist ignored warning signs and clambered over a rope to venture onto the edge of the Na Mueang 2 waterfall, the same place where a Spanish holidaymaker died after posing for photos in July.</p>
      <p>Mr Palmier was standing near the waterfall's cliff edge while taking a selfie or trying to get into position for a selfie when he slipped and fell to his death onto sharp, wet rocks and into the pool below.</p>

      <p>Police and rescue workers retrieved the tourist's body, which was floating face down in the water.</p>
      <p>He was pronounced dead at the scene after suffering gruesome injuries in the fall.</p>
      <p>Mr Palmier's pal, Thomas Mechin, told police he had invited his "childhood friend" on a dream holiday to see him at his new home in Thailand.</p>
      <p>He said that they had reached the top of the waterfall when "Bastien wanted to go further into the prohibited zone that was near the cliff edge".</p>
      <p>Thomas told police he "warned him to stay away but he didn't listen" and he "crossed the rope that was closing off the area".</p>

      <p>Mr Palmier was "trying to take a selfie on the edge of the waterfall" when he slipped and fell, Thomas told officers.</p>
      <p>Police said that retrieving the body was made more difficult by the slippery rocks, but after three hours the rescuers were finally able to carry him out of the waterfall by tying him to a stretcher, which was dragged up with ropes.</p>
      <p>Police Liutenant Colonel Phuwadol Wiriyawarangkul said: "Tourists should not enter the prohibited area, as the park officers have closed it off for the safety of visitors.</p>
      <p>"We believe that this death was an accident caused by the tourist violating the restricted area.</p>
      <p>"His friend told us that the victim wanted to take a selfie at the waterfall so he crossed over the barrier.</p>
      <p>"The embassy has been informed and his body will be sent for a postmortem examination."</p>
      <p>In July, Spanish tourist David Rocamundi Conesa, 26, died in a fall at the same spot shortly after posing for photos.</p>
