      <h1>It's a family affray: Mother, daughter and son force entry to woman's flat over infidelity fears</h1>
      <h2>Jamie, Tempany and Kane Sloanes feared Tempany's boyfriend was being unfaithful when he went to a woman's flat in Sunderland</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T08:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Rob Kennedy</a></address>
      <p>A mother and her two children forced their way into a woman's home after accusing her visitor of being unfaithful.</p>
      <p>Pregnant Tempany Sloanes' boyfriend had gone to the victim's home to fix some damage her brother, Kane Sloanes, had done to the woman's car.</p>
      <p>But when he didn't return or answer Tempany's phone calls, she became concerned about what he was up to.</p>
      <p>As a result the mother, Jamie Sloanes, and children went round and Kane kicked the door in and once inside Jamie threw two bottles amid the disturbance.</p>
      <p>Now all three have been put on curfews and given community orders after they admitted affray at Newcastle Crown Court.</p>
      <p>The court heard on May 2 last year, after Kane had been released from police custody for damaging the car, Tempany's boyfriend went to rectify the damage, but he then stayed there, along with others, socialising.</p>
      <p>Neil Pallister, prosecuting, said: "The fact he didn't return to Tempany Sloanes caused her to make inquiries about his whereabouts, still believing him to be at the woman's address.</p>
      <p>"The mother, Jamie Sloanes, daughter, Tempany and son, Kane, all went round to her address."</p>
      <p>They arrived at the flat, at Bede House, Sunderland, around 11.30 that night but the four people inside, including the boyfriend, ignored their knocks on the door.</p>
      <p>Kane Sloanes then kicked open the door, causing £200 of damage.</p>
      <p>Mr Pallister said: "The three defendants entered the flat and their anger was initially directed towards (the boyfriend) who was accused of being unfaithful to Tempany Sloanes.</p>
      <p>"All three had raised voices and all three demanded he left with them.</p>
      <p>"During that, Jamie Sloanes picked up two bottles and threw them towards (the boyfriend and another man). They weren't hit by the bottles.</p>
      <p>"A glass coffee table was over turned but not broken."</p>
      <p>After five minutes, the trio left and on the way out, Tempany Sloanes pulled a picture frame from the wall in the hallway.</p>
      <p>The flat owner said in a victim impact statement: "In the space of a few hours I had two upsetting incidents at the hands of Kane and his family.</p>
      <p>"A person should feel safe and secure in their own home.</p>
      <p>"I now don't feel safe living alone in my flat and I want this to stop."</p>
      <p>Jamie Sloanes, 42, Tempany Sloanes, 21 and Kane Sloanes, 18, all living at Peasemore Road, Sunderland, at the time, were each given community orders with four month curfews between 9pm and 6.30am. Tempany has to pay £15 compensation and Kane £50.</p>
      <p>Nicoleta Alistari, for Jamie Sloanes, said she works in McDonald's, has 11-year-old twins and helps with her grandchild.</p>
      <p>Miss Alistari said: "As the mother of the other two defendants, she accepts she really ought to know better.</p>
      <p>"Her regrettable behaviour was borne out of concern for her then pregnant daughter, who believed the father of her unborn child was being unfaithful. He was at least insensitive in not answering her many calls that night.</p>
      <p>"Whatever the truth, the relationship ended and has not resumed.</p>
      <p>"Jamie Sloanes reacted unwisely but in the manner of an over-protective parent, having seen her daughter's distress."</p>
      <p>Nick Lane, for Tempany Sloanes, said: "She feels deep remorse, shame and embarrassment in involving herself in this offending."</p>
      <p>Mr Lane said it was after seeing a Snapchat message that she believed she had been lied to and became upset.</p>
      <p>He said she now lives with her baby and has an injunction against her ex.</p>
      <p>Graham O'Sullivan, for Kane Sloanes, said he is now working in a chicken factory, which was "clearly not his dream job".</p>
      <p>He was only 17 at the time of the incident.</p>
