      <h1>Arsenal: There’s no ‘if’ with Alexandre Lacazette, only ‘when’</h1>
      <h2>Alexandre Lacazette isn’t having his best year for Arsenal, but there is no question of ‘if’ he will turn it around. It’s 100% a matter of ‘when’.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T08:00:41+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://paininthearsenal.com/author/joshsippie/" target="_blank">Josh Sippie</a></address>
      <p>You wouldn’t have thought that <a href="https://paininthearsenal.com/category/arsenal-news/">Arsenal</a> fans had the capacity to move from their <a href="https://fbref.com/en/players/e61b8aee/Granit-Xhaka?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-">Granit Xhaka</a> triumph to a more difficult challenge, but lo and behold, <a href="https://fbref.com/en/players/9dbb75ca/Alexandre-Lacazette?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-">Alexandre Lacazette</a> is the man now taking fire from fans, as he has been struggling all year after getting two goals at the start of the season.</p>
      <p>It’s remarkable, really, how quickly fans forget. Regardless, what we all need to remember, and you shouldn’t even have to be reminded of this, is that Lacazette is our reigning player of the season for a reason, and it’s not because he disappears from matches and doesn’t track back on defense.</p>
      <p>It’s for the opposite reasons. It’s because he is <i>always</i> present in matches and <i>always</i> tracks back to defend.</p>
      <p>Which is the most important thing to focus on right now. With Lacazette, it has never been a matter of ‘if’, but ‘when.’</p>
      <p>For as long as he has been a Gunner, Lacazette has had trouble recovering from even small injuries. But it wasn’t a matter of ‘if’ he would find himself again, but ‘when’. Sure, it takes him longer than we like, but most players have trouble coming back from injury. It’s a regular thing.</p>
      <p><i>When</i> they get back, they are as good as new. Often better. I think of <a href="https://fbref.com/en/players/16380240/Mesut-Ozil?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-">Mesut Ozil</a>‘s long-term injury way back when. That was the most improved he ever got, all from sustaining an injury.</p>
      <p>Think back to two years ago. After going through a goalless streak and then getting hurt, Lacazette returned only to find his path blocked by <a href="https://fbref.com/en/players/d5dd5f1f/Pierre-Emerick-Aubameyang?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-">Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</a>. Even then, it was never a matter of ‘if’ he would recover from the setbacks, but ‘when.’</p>
      <p>So why then would fans turn on Lacazette now that he is having trouble recovering from an injury? Do they honestly think that there’s a chance he won’t? Because if so it’s just a gross overabundance of impatience. Even if I risk sounding like Unai Emery, I have to say—just be patient with Lacazette because <i>when</i> he gets back to his best, we will all be happy and smiling and remember that, lo and behold, he’s the same guy he’s always been.</p>
      <p>Just another unnecessary reminder that things are way better than most think they are. Lacazette is a beast, and he will rise again.</p>
