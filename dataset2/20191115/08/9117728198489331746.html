        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lewis-hamilton">Lewis Hamilton's</a> contract is up for renewal in 2020, but the six-time Formula 1 World Champion wants clarification on the future of Toto Wolff before he commits his future to <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mercedes-amg-f1-team">Mercedes</a>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hamilton sealed his sixth World Championship at the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/grandsprix/united-states-grand-prix">US Grand Prix</a> and his fifth at Mercedes, all under the leadership of Toto Wolff. The Mercedes team principal has been linked with the top job at Formula 1 with Chase Carey's future not set in stone.</p>
      <p>Hamilton has a contract at the Silver Arrows until 2020 and is expected to commit further but he wants some clarification on Wolff's future first.</p>
      <p><i>"It's a difficult one because I know being stuck in one position for too long can not always be a positive so I always want people to spread their wings and do what is best for their careers. Only he knows what that is,"</i> Hamilton told the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/50426129">BBC</a>.</p>

        <i>"This team is not one person. It's a huge group of people. But it is important to me and I am waiting to see where his head is at. The sport could also be in a good place with someone like him running it but I don't know if that's more of a fun experience."</i>
