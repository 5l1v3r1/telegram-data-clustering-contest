      <p>The local government funding crisis has led to Devon County Council’s boss admitting that ‘the system is broken’, Devon County Council’s boss has admitted.</p>
      <p>At month six, the council is now projecting a £32m overspend for 2019/20 – up from £28.1m at month four.</p>
      <p>The overspend includes a Dedicated Schools Grant funding shortfall relating to Special Educational Needs and Disabilities of £18.7m, up £2.9m from the month four position.</p>
      <p>Speaking at Wednesday’s cabinet meeting, Dr Phil Norrey, Chief Executive of Devon County Council, said: “There is a recognition that the system is broken and we cannot go on as we are.”</p>
      <p>In 2014, the Government changed the way in which the SEND system was funded, but Dr Norrey said: “This is a national issue and it is right at the top of the agenda, but fundamentally the government has got it wrong.</p>

      <p>“They have completely underestimated the cost of the reforms. There is a recognition it is neither fair nor sustainable for local authorities to have to bail it out from their general funds. There is a recognition that the system is broken and we cannot go on as we are. What that means in terms of huge policy developments, I don’t know.”</p>

      <p>The report of Mary Davis, the County Treasurer, to Wednesday’s cabinet meeting states at month six, the council is now projecting a £32m overspend, compared to the £28.1m at month four. This includes planned contributions to reserves of £8m are not expected to be made this financial year, and a funding shortfall relating to Special Educational Needs and Disabilities of £18.7m. That figure is set to be held as a ‘negative reserve’ on the balance sheet to be dealt with in future years.</p>
      <p>Cllr John Hart, leader of the council, said that the figures speak for themselves. He added: “We are under pressure in a way we haven’t been before, but it is a physical demand from the public that is pushing this. The government changed the rules and then didn’t fund the difference.</p>
      <p>“We are doing what we can but the demand is the issue, rather than how much money we have in the pot. The law says if we don’t handle the demand, it goes to court and then costs us twice as much.”</p>

      <p>Mrs Davis added: “Our overspending has increased. It is concerning but not overly concerning. We still have six months to go and we have been in worse positions before, but do need to exercise caution.”</p>
      <p>On the SEND overspend, she said that holding it as a ‘negative reserve’, which was as near as can be an instruction from the Government to do, she said that it wouldn’t be a problem for this year, but will be in future years unless there is more funding from the Government. She said: “We cannot see it growing year and year as then it will impact on the working of the county council.”</p>
      <p>But opposition councillors raised concerns about the budget overspends, saying that it meant that the alarm bells should be ringing.</p>

      <p>Cllr Alan Connett, leader of the Liberal Democrat group, said: “There are some things that are within the control of the council that the administration is not progressing with. £1.7m of the cross-council savings initiatives target of £1.9m are currently not expected to be met this year. You identified the savings and said they would need to be made to balance the books, and you are not achieving them.”</p>
      <p>He added: “Demand is rising and government funding is falling, but the council cannot look with any certainty for next year as still waiting for a government, any government, to tell us what the funding for next year will be and that doesn’t help anyone plan, and we don’t know what a bad winter could bring us. If the alarm bells weren’t ringing before, they are now.”</p>
      <p>Cllr Rob Hannaford, leader of the Labour Group, added: “This does feel a bit like crisis management, even if it is a medium level of crisis management. This is an ongoing trend and a serious trend, and clearly the phrase ‘we cannot go on like this’ has never been more true.”</p>

      <h3>Devon Community Insight Survey</h3>
      <p>Devon residents are being asked what matters most in a survey run by Devon County Council.</p>
      <p>The Community Insight Survey asks about experiences of a range of services and the County Council’s strategic aims.</p>
      <p>It also asks questions about Council Tax increases, community resources, if people have good access to green spaces, and if the council’s decision make sense.</p>
      <p>A council spokesman said: “We are committed to building a Devon where everyone can live their lives well, and to do this we need to understand what matters most to you and where you experience difficulties. The results will be shared across services and used to inform budget decisions and how services are provided in future.”</p>
      <p>The survey can be filled in online at  <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=gzehjWjLP0S7S5l_d_1b-3k2zoamfoJKgcKfgFq7GXBUQ0lXOFI1MVlPQkQ3N1Q0NUZPWFM1R1VENy4u">https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=gzehjWjLP0S7S5l_d_1b-3k2zoamfoJKgcKfgFq7GXBUQ0lXOFI1MVlPQkQ3N1Q0NUZPWFM1R1VENy4u</a></p>

      <p>He questioned whether future reports should refer to underfunding rather than overspends, as most of them are demand led pressures that the council has have little control over.</p>
