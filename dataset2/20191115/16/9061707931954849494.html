      <h1>Why plans for new Derby Aldi store look likely to be rejected</h1>
      <h2>Almost 30 letters of objection to the plan have been received</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T16:59:12+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 16:59</time> by <a rel="author">Zena Hawley</a></address>
      <p>Plans for a <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/aldi">seventh Aldi store</a> in Derby to be built in Heatherton have been recommended for refusal by city planning officers.</p>
      <p>A meeting of the city council's planning control committee will discuss the application for the store in Rykneld Road, south of The Hollybrook pub.</p>
      <p>The report accompanying it says that 29 letters of objection to the project have been received, citing access concerns, impact on neighbours, additional road congestion, loss of trees and hedgerows, destruction of a greenfield site and its situation away from the residential area would mean trips by car for people.</p>
      <p>One letter of support was received.</p>
      <p>The council's tree officer expressed concerns about the loss of three mature oak trees and the police said they had concerns with the layout of the site.</p>
      <p>A report from the police liaison officer sad that the main pedestrian access runs from Rykneld Road along a neighbouring woodland between the site and the pub.</p>
      <p>He added: "There is open access into this woodland and within this land signs of anti-social misuse. In my view, running a public footpath tight up to this area presents an unnecessary risk to more vulnerable pedestrians."</p>

      <p>The council officer's report acknowledges there is a need to expand Heatherton neighbourhood centre and help meet convenience shopping needs in that part of the city.</p>
      <p>It continues that a new retail unit in the location is accepted but there are concerns with the design and layout of the store in terms of how it would "function as a cohesive and well-related extension to the existing neighbourhood centre as opposed to a standalone store".</p>
      <p>It adds that there are also outstanding issues in respect of drainage, ecology and archaeology and therefore recommends refusal of planning permission.</p>
      <p>The planning control committee meeting start at 6pm in the Council House on Thursday, November 21.</p>
