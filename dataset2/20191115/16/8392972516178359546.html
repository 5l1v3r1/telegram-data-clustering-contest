Get Me Out Of Here!</a>, has opened up about feeling like she "let herself down" during her stint on <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/reality-tv/big-brother/">Big Brother</a>.</p>
      <p>Adele was one of the contestants on <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/reality-tv/big-brother/">the reality show</a> back in 2002, when she entered the house alongside late star Jade Goody.</p>

      <p>The pair clashed a number of times on the programme, including one memorable argument that ensued after Jade discovered she had a "minging" verruca.</p>

      <p>Famously, Jade almost walked from the Big Brother house after that row, although was eventually persuaded to stay.</p>
      <p>As reported by the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/im-celebs-adele-roberts-feels-20884537">Mirror</a>, Adele said she felt like she "carried a lot of guilt" over her behaviour on the show and admitted she "could have been a much nicer person".</p>

      <p>She said: "Looking back, I carried a lot of guilt about the way I acted in Big Brother and I feel like I let myself down and I could have been a much nicer person.</p>
      <p>"I just think I judged people when I shouldn't have, I should have tried to get to know them a bit more and I think I probably hurt people when I didn't realise when I was in there.</p>

      <p>"It was only because I've come out that I realised that words are really powerful and you should try and build people up. I just let the game get to me and got too negative and I just won't do that again this time."</p>
      <p>Jade Goody later stared in <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/reality-tv/celebrity-big-brother/">Celebrity Big Brother</a>. She was <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/jade-goody-got-cervical-cancer-diagnosis-on-indian-big-brother/">diagnosed with cervical cancer</a> in 2008 and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/jade-goodys-strength-for-her-son-in-dying-moments-revealed/">lost her battle with the disease on March 22, 2009</a>.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in the interview, Adele said that by appearing on I'm A Celeb, she would like to "show a better side" to herself by treating her campmates well and having a "positive experience".</p>
