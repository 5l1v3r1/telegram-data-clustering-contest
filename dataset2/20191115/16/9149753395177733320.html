      <h3>Sims 4 friendship and romance cheats</h3>
      <p>If your Sims have the same problem making friends that I have in real life, the cheat console code <b>relationship.introduce_sim_to_all_others</b> will instantly introduce your Sim to all their neighbors.</p>
      <p>For an even easier icebreaker,<b> relationships.create_friends_for_sim</b> will spawn a new Sim on the lot already already friends with yours.</p>
      <p>If you need more specific friendship (and romance) control, use the following to add and subtract from relationships between two Sims:</p>
      <p>
        <b>modifyrelationship [YourSimFirstName] [YourSimLastName] [TargetSimFirstName] [TargetSimLastName] 100 LTR_Friendship_Main </b>
      </p>
      <p>Substitute "Friendship" for "Romance" to change romantic relationship values. Positive values will increase a relationship, while using a negative value (ex: -100) will decrease it.</p>
      <h3>Kill and un-kill your sims and pets</h3>
      <p>To save your Sims from death entirely, use <b>death.toggle [true/false]</b>. For all your other deadly designs, use the following:</p>
      <p><b>sims.add_buff Ghostly</b> will turn your sim into a ghost for 4 in-game hours. </p>
      <p><b>traits.equip_trait Ghost_OldAge [Pet ID] </b>will turn your pet into a ghost if you are either an absolute monster or (spoiler alert) attempting an elaborate Sim version of John Wick. To get your pet's ID (you monster), use <b>sims.get_sim_id_by_name [PetFirstName] [PetLastName]</b></p>
      <p>In the Sims 4 Vampire expansion, you can kill your fanged sims with <b>stats.set_stat commodity_Vampire_SunExposure -100</b>. You can also turn a regular Sim into sun-killed vampire with <b>traits.equip_trait Vampire_Sun</b>.<b>  </b></p>
      <p>In the Seasons expansion there are a few ways to kill and resurrect your sims with seasonal effects. Use <b>traits.[equip/remove]_trait Ghost_Overheat</b> to create or undo a Sim who has died of heat. You can also substitute "Overheat" for "Frozen" or "Lightning". In the Jungle Adventure expansion you can use "poison" instead.</p>
      <h3>Sims 4 UI cheats</h3>
      <p>Use these handy UI cheats to remove game elements from your view or add extra utilities:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>headlineeffects [on/off]: </b>Enables or disables headline effects like plumbobs and speech bubbles</li>
        <li><b>hovereffects [on/off]: </b>Disable hover effect when you mouseover a Sim</li>
        <li><b>fullscreenToggle: </b>Makes the game fullscreen/windowed</li>
        <li><b>fps [on/off]: </b>Display the fps on screen</li>
      </ul>
