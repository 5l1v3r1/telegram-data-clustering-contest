      <h1>Florida State vs. Alabama State: Game Time, Spread, Channel, Announcers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T16:51:21+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 16:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>The Florida State Seminoles will look to get that coveted sixth win of the season when they take on the Alabama State Hornets.</p>
      <p>To say that the 2019 season has been a disaster for Florida State might almost be an insult to disasters. And yet, despite <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/willie-taggart-fired-official">firing head coach Willie Taggart</a>, dealing with a multitude of injuries and troubles at quarterback, the Seminoles need just one win to secure bowl eligibility.</p>
      <p>Alabama State have been a rather average FCS team this year. They lost their only other game against an FBS team, in their season opener against UAB. Though they’re 4-4 with a respectable offense, it’s hard to imagine the Hornets pulling off an FCS over FBS upset.</p>
      <p>Given how often Power Five teams crush their FCS opposition, the ‘Noles have been listed as massive favorites over the Hornets. They’ll be favored by nearly six touchdowns at home.</p>
      <p>Here are the details for the game:</p>

      <p><b>Game Time:</b> 12:00 PM ET</p>
      <p><b>Channel:</b> ACC RSNs</p>
      <p><b>Spread:</b> Florida State -41.5</p>
      <p><b>Over/Under:</b> 54.5</p>
      <p><b>Announcers:</b> Tom Werme, James Bates, Kelsey Wingert</p>
      <p>The game will undoubtedly have massive implications for interim head coach Odell Haggins.</p>
      <p>A win over Alabama State combined with a competitive game against Florida next week would make a huge case for him being named to the position full time. It’s certainly something <a href="https://thespun.com/acc/florida-state/fsu-players-make-their-choice-for-head-coach-clear">the players seem to want</a>.</p>
