      <p>Shanghai - <b>Tour de France</b> winner <b>Egan Bernal</b> said on Friday that competitive cyclists are only ever one corner from catastrophe, reflecting on <b>Chris Froome's</b> high-speed crash in June.</p>
      <p>The four-time Tour champion Froome fractured a thigh, elbow and vertebrae during the Criterium du Dauphine stage race and last week had more surgery.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old has admitted that he is "grateful to be alive".</p>
      <p>Bernal, the Briton's team-mate at Ineos, said that one slip-up has the potential to be fatal.</p>
      <p>"It's something that you never want to think about when you're on the bike because then it's scary," the 22-year-old Colombian told AFP on the eve of the Tour's criterium in Shanghai.</p>
      <p>"But it's something real, it's something real that on any corner, in any downhill or any part of the race, you can crash and die.</p>
      <p>"But it's part of our profession. For sure it's a big risk, but it's our job," added Bernal, who suffered a broken collarbone in a crash during training earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Froome, who hopes to recover sufficiently to make another tilt at the Tour de France in 2020, returned to competitive cycling three weeks ago.</p>
      <p>He took part in a team time trial run round a single lap at the Tour's Saitama Criterium, where Bernal was also involved.</p>
      <p>Bernal, the first Colombian to win the Tour de France, cycling's most prestigious race, was buoyed by what he saw from his team-mate.</p>
      <p>"I was surprised because he was telling us that he was not really good and in the time trial he will not go too far," said Bernal.</p>
      <p>"Then when he started he was going really, really hard and I was a bit surprised because he did surgery just a few months ago and now he is in good shape.</p>
      <p>"Not (good enough at the moment) to win the Tour de France, but already in a good form.</p>
      <p>"For sure he will be even better next year, I hope."</p>
      <p>Bernal said that he will sit down with the Ineos Team in December to map out the year ahead and decide which races to prioritise.</p>
      <p>For definite, he will compete at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and is relishing representing his country.</p>
      <p>"It's one of the biggest races in the world and it's only every four years," he said.</p>
      <p>"It's important for the country, the people, the Colombians."</p>
