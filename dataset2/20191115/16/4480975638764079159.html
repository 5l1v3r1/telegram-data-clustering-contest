      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/central-banks/fed">Federal Reserve Bank</a> of New York's latest Nowcasting Report published on Friday, the United States' (US) economy is expected to expand by 0.4% in the last quarter of the year.</p>
      <p>"News from this week's data releases decreased the nowcast for 2019:Q4 by 0.3 percentage point," the NY Des said in its publication. "Negative surprises from capacity utilization and industrial production data drove most of the decrease."</p>
      <p>In the meantime, the US Dollar Index stays in the negative territory near the 98 handle, looking to register a weekly loss of around 0.4%.</p>
