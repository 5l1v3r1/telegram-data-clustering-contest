      <p>England have booked their place in the finals of Euro 2020 thanks to an emphatic victory over Montenegro at Wembley.</p>
      <p>And there were plenty of talking points as <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/england-football-team">Gareth Southgate's men</a> cruised to three points and ensure Three Lions fans have something to shout next summer.</p>
      <p>Here's a few things we noticed on the night as the FA celebrated 1,000 international matches.</p>

        <b>Gazza enjoys the acclaim from a packed house at Wembley</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Geordie and England legend was enjoying himself during a half-time parade as he laughed and joked with Euro 96 team-mates such as David Seaman and Tony Adams.</p>
      <p>Gazza won the hearts and minds of the nation in Italia 90 and in the European Championships on English soil six years later.</p>
      <p>After the game <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/paul-gascoigne">Gazza,</a> who stood side by side with the former Arsenal shot-stopper, said in the mixed zone: "Everybody talks about my goal against Scotland at Wembley!</p>
      <p>"People forget Dave saved the penalty and it was the best in 5,000 years at Wembley!</p>
      <p>"The Dentist's chair celebration was planned for whoever scored next, and it was me."</p>

        <b>Harry Kane rises past greatness but Gary Lineker makes a good point</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kane netted a treble inside 37 minutes and went past <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/alan-shearer">Alan Shearer,</a> Frank Lampard, Nat Lofthouse and Tom Finney in the process to take his tally to 31.</p>
      <p>Roy Keane commented on the difference between the quality of opposition by joking during ITV's coverage that he could possible overtake all-time leading scorer Wayne Rooney in the second half, but Lineker quickly posted to Twitter: "I would suggest, for context, that Shearer’s goals would’ve been scored against significantly stronger opposition."</p>
      <p>Given the standard of some of the opponents for England during Kane's run, such as San Marino, Malta and Panama, people seemed to agree with Lineker after his tweet yielded over 12,500 likes.</p>

        <b>Supermac's record of scoring five in a game survives - but he is overlooked by FA for an invite to big night</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Newcastle legend famously grabbed five goals against Cyprus at Wembley in 1975.</p>
      <p>With Kane enjoying hat-trick during the half-time breaks Lineker tweeted that Macdonald might be feeling "twitchy" during the break about his record.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/malcolm-macdonald">Supermac</a> incredible effort remained intact.</p>
      <p>After the game a fan asked Supermac if he had been invited to the celebrations, to which he replied: "Sadly not."</p>
