      <p>The Republic of Ireland has the 10th largest number of bankers earning €1 million or more a year in the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=European+Union">European Union</a>.</p>
      <p>The figures, which come from the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=European+Banking+Authority">European Banking Authority</a>, show there were 28 Irish bankers who collectively received €30.75 million in remuneration in 2017.</p>
      <p>The average total remuneration per individual was €1.8 million. Of these, 10 individuals were working in investment banking, nine in senior management roles in banks, five in asset management, and two in retail banking.</p>
      <p>The figures cover individuals working for foreign-owned institutions, rather than Irish banks, where there is a €500,000 cap on pay still in place.</p>
      <p>Overall, the data shows that the number of high earners in European banks receiving a remuneration of more than €1 million slightly increased from 4,597 in 2016 to 4, 859 in 2017.</p>
      <p>The average ratio between the variable and fixed remuneration for high earners continued to fall from 104 per cent to 101.08 per cent over the same period.</p>
      <p>The largest population of high earners in the EU with 3,567 millionaires were located in the UK, which was home to close to three-quarters of all high earners.</p>
      <p>Most member states registered an increase in the number of high earners in 2017 with the Republic of Ireland being among only a handful of countries to record a slight decrease.</p>
