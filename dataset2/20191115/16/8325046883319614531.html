      <p>The 5G base stations that Chinese telecom giant Huawei has been producing without components from United States suppliers have been performing 30% better than those with American parts, Vincent Pang, Huawei senior vice president, said at a press dinner on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The company has been forced to build its 5G base stations without American components after the US government placed Huawei on a trade blacklist in May citing national security concerns. As a result, firms in the United States have been prohibited from doing business with Huawei without obtaining permission from the government.</p>
      <p>Huawei previously said in September that it would start mass-producing 5G base stations without parts from United States suppliers in October, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-huawei-tech/huawei-says-it-has-begun-producing-5g-base-stations-without-u-s-parts-idUSKBN1WB0YD">Reuters.</a></p>
      <p>Annual production of the company’s 5G base stations is estimated to reach 1.5 million units next year, Pang also said, representing a jump from the 400,000 units Huawei forecasted for 2019.</p>
      <p>That calls into question why Huawei would want to work with American companies again if allowed, since it claims it’s capable of producing better-performing equipment without doing so. According to Pang, Huawei wants to maintain its relationship with the United States to keep the global supply chain in tact.</p>
      <p>“If we cut that relationship with all US suppliers, what’s going to happen?” Pang said to reporters on Tuesday evening. “We still want to maintain one standard, one supply chain, one ecosystem.”</p>
      <p>The US government has yet to approve licenses for companies wishing to do business with Huawei, but Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross recently <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-03/ross-optimistic-on-china-trade-deal-says-huawei-licenses-coming">told Bloomberg</a> that license approvals would be coming “very shortly.” The report also said that 260 companies filed requests to work with the Chinese tech giant.</p>
      <p>Huawei’s carrier division accounts for a large chunk of the company’s overall business. According to its <a href="https://www.huawei.com/us/press-events/annual-report/2018">2018 annual report</a>, it accounted for 40.8% of the firm’s business, while its consumer division was responsible for 48.4%.</p>
      <p>Despite being blacklisted from working with US companies, Huawei’s business hasn’t faltered. The company’s fiscal <a href="https://www.huawei.com/en/press-events/news/2019/10/huawei-announces-q3-2019-business-results">third-quarter revenue</a> increased by 24.4% year-over-year.</p>
