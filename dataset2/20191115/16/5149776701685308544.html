      <p>A 43-year-old man from Nottinghamshire has pleaded guilty to abducting a boy in Derby.</p>
      <p>Darren Cox, of Meden Crescent, Sutton-in-Ashfield, entered his plea at <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/courts">Nottingham Crown Court </a>on Friday, November 15.</p>
      <p>The child, described as under 16 in the charge and who cannot be identified, was abducted on October 13 this year.</p>
      <p>After Cox entered his plea, no further details were given in court about the background to the allegation.</p>
      <p>The abduction charge read out said he detained the child so as to keep him out of the lawful control of a woman.</p>
      <p>He will be sentenced by <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/crime">Judge</a> Stuart Rafferty QC on Friday, January 17.</p>
      <p>Barrister Simon Eckersley, representing Cox, told the judge he had uploaded a basis of plea.</p>
      <p>He said Cox was on certain medication and "there is a personality disorder" and "it may be your honour is assisted with a psychiatric report".</p>
      <p>The judge ordered a pre-sentence and psychiatric reports be prepared.</p>
      <p>"Clearly he will get credit for his guilty plea," he said. "The defendant will remain in custody until sentence in January."</p>
