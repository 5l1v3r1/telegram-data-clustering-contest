      <p>Officers were alerted to a body at around 11:10am that morning.</p>
      <p>The man, 36, is expected to appear at Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court on Monday.</p>
      <p>Detective Chief Inspector Kevin Jamieson, of Police Scotland's Major Investigation Team, said: "Thank you to the members of the local community who have provided information and assistance in relation to our investigation.</p>
      <p>"Your help and support has been appreciated."</p>
      <p>"Local officers have been and will continue to be in the local area to provide reassurance."</p>
      <p>We told you how a 'traumatised' pensioner was attacked in her own home by a callous thug - who nicked cash, bank cards and house keys.</p>
      <p>The 88-year-old woman was assaulted at the property in Windsor Crescent, Paisley, at around 6.25pm on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The brute then made off with a three-figure sum of money, along with the cards and keys.</p>
