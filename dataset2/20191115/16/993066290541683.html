      <p>A former headmaster accused of historical sex abuse has been found not guilty.</p>
      <p>William Lloyd-Lavery, from Richmond Avenue in Lisburn, was principal of Lurgan Technical College from 1992-97.</p>
      <p>The 71-year-old faced 13 sex offence charges at Craigavon Crown Court, but was found not guilty today.</p>
      <p>The jury of four men and eight women deliberated for just less than an hour before returning unanimous not guilty verdicts.</p>
      <p>When all the verdicts had been read he looked at the jury and mouthed the words: "Thank you."</p>
      <p>Thanking the jury for their service, trial Judge Patrick Lynch QC told Mr Lloyd-Lavery he was free to go and leaving the dock, he thanked the judge.</p>
      <p>The retired headmaster has always denied the offences which were seven counts of indecent assault, four of committing an act of gross indecency with or towards a child, one of inciting a child to engage in an act of gross indecency and one of taking an indecent photograph of a child, all alleged to have been committed on dates unknown between 29 December 1980 and 1 February 1988.</p>
      <p>He gave evidence on his own behalf to deny that he had ever done anything against the complainant, labelling the allegations as a “pack of lies” which “did not happen and could not have happened.”</p>
      <p>During his evidence in chief, the specifics of the allegations were put to Lloyd-Lavery and he told defence QC Kieron Mallon: “I certainly did nothing of the kind - I’m quite outraged by it.”</p>
      <p>Mr Lloyd-Lavery told Mr Mallon the account given by the complainant, who said he was aged between six and 13 at the time, “is complete lies and nonsense [with] no truth in it whatsoever.”</p>
      <p>“There’s no truth in it - it didn’t happen hundreds of times, it didn’t happen once,” he declared.</p>
      <p>Outside the courthouse as he was leaving, Mr Lloyd-Lavery declined to comment.</p>
