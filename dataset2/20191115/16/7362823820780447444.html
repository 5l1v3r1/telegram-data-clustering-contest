      <p>A former <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/georgia">Georgia bank teller</a> accused of stealing over $12,000 from the accounts of bank customers says he was <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/robbery-theft">forced into crime</a> by another man who threatened to publicize the teller's affair with a co-worker, according to the Forsyth County Sheriff's Office.</p>
      <p>Jordan Paul Jernigan, 22, was arrested on Oct. 22, in connection with the $12,500 that went missing from a Wells Fargo branch on Johns Creek Parkway in south Forsyth County, following an investigation by Wells Fargo and the Forsyth County Sheriff's Office.</p>
      <p>Wells Fargo allegedly contacted deputies about the missing cash in late spring, according to the <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/georgia-bank-teller-says-man-forced-him-take-500-reveal-affair/0JGFs8BZUZuJ4ZnCv2HItN/?__twitter_impression=true">Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a>.</p>

      <p>He then provided that money to Nicholas Brown, who extorted the cash out of him in exchange for being quiet about his affair, according to the outlet.</p>
      <p>Wells Fargo says that Jernigan no longer works at the bank but couldn't comment further due to the open investigation.</p>
      <p>An arrest warrant has been issued for Brown, who moved to California before they could be signed, the sheriff's office told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. They plan on extraditing him to Georgia to face three counts of fraud and theft.</p>
