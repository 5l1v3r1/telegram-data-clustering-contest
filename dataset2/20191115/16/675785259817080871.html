      <h1>EastEnders fans will have to wait for follow up to last night's tragic episode</h1>
      <h2>Fans will have to wait four days to see scenes unfold in Walford following Mel Owen's death as tonight's EastEnders has been edged out of the listings by Children In Need</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T16:44:56+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 16:44</time> by <a rel="author">Will Twigger, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/will-twigger/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/eastenders">EastEnders</a> gave fans a shocking end to veteran character Mel Owen as she was killed during a car crash last night.</p>
      <p>Now they'll have to wait a whopping four days to see what happens as the usual Friday night installment has been replaced this evening by charity telethon Children In Need.</p>
      <p>Fans usually get a dose of the Albert Square lot Mondays, Tuesday, Thursdays and Fridays, but this week they'll have to content themselves with a mere three episodes - plus something special during Children In Need.</p>
      <p>The BBC charity bash is set to be a star-studded affair - kicking off at 7:30 this evening, it boasts Star Wars and Doctor Who features, as well as the return of 80s hit, Crackerjack.</p>

      <p>The England football team will also be showing their faces.</p>
      <p>What fans might not be expecting, though, is a collaboration between their favourite east Londoners and the Strictly judges, as a lineup of EastEnders stars will take to the floor for a good cause.</p>
      <p>Ricky Champ will be dancing with Strictly pro Luba Mushtuk, while Louisa Lytton's been paired up with Gorka Marquez, Maisie Smith with Kevin Clifton and Rudolph Walker OBE with newcomer Nancy Xu.</p>
      <p>Hosting is just as celeb-heavy, with Tess Daly, Ade Adepitan, Graham Norton, Mel Giedroyc, Marvin and Rochelle Humes and newbie Tom Allen all appealing to the public to give generously.</p>

      <p>Last night's EastEnders saw Mel - played by actress Tamzin Outhwaite - bow out of the role she's inhabited on/off since the late 90s.</p>
      <p>Tamzin, 49, reached out to the fans via <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> to reveal she was feeling "emotional" following the episode.</p>
      <p>"Thank you all..." the star penned, "Tonight thankfully I'm busy as I'm too emotional to address any @bbceastenders messages tonight...but..." with a praying emoji.</p>
      <p>Mel's had a rough time during her run on the show - she agreed to marry Ian Beale back in 1999 out of guilt, after he revealed to her his daughter had cancer.</p>
      <p>In 2002, then husband Steve met his end in an explosion following a car crash.</p>
