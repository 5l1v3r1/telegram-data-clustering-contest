      <p>A choir teacher has been hailed for calmly rendering first aid to a student wounded in Thursday’s <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/5-arrested-in-northern-california-halloween-house-party-shootign-that-left-5-dead">California</a> school shooting amid the chaotic scene.</p>
      <p>Eddie Mendoza, 17, one of the students huddled in Katie Holt’s barricaded <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/oregon-football-coach-disarms-student-shotgun">classroom</a>, said Holt was “literally a hero” for doing what she did, Reuters reported.</p>
      <p>Holt took action when another student said that she’d been hit, <a href="https://www.foxla.com/news/saugus-high-school-choir-director-rushes-to-treat-wounded-student-after-gunman-opens-fire-on-campus">Fox 11 Los Angeles</a> reported. She also barricaded her classroom with a piano.</p>

      <p>As Holt treated the girl's wound with a gunshot wound kit, the girl told her she had another bullet wound.</p>
      <p>“I used what I could to dress her other wound and she was responsive, she was joking around a little bit. She was really strong,” Holt said, according to the station.</p>
      <p>The girl was among five students shot at Saugus High School in Santa Clarita Thursday morning when a student on his 16th birthday opened fire with a .45 caliber handgun, police said. Two of the students were killed.</p>

      <p>"It was just so hard hearing her say 'I want my mom,'” Eddie said of the wounded girl. “It was heartbreaking."</p>
      <p>"Our teacher was very calm and collected," a student named Pamela said of Holt during an interview with Reuters.</p>
      <p>Pamela said roughly 35 students were holed up with the teacher waiting for police to arrive. She said they all remained calm. Police reached them after about 30 minutes.</p>

      <p>The girl said the ordeal left her feeling "numb" as she sought to console other classmates shaken by the events, according to Reuters.</p>
      <p>"I just feel distant from it," she said.</p>
