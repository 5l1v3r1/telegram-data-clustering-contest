      <p>The Toronto Maple Leafs announced on Friday that center Alexander Kerfoot is out indefinitely after he <a href="https://twitter.com/LeafsPR/status/1195357186517590026">underwent surgery to repair facial dental fractures</a>.</p>
      <p>According to the team, Kerfoot <a href="https://twitter.com/LeafsPR/status/1195357248677195777">originally sustained the injury</a> during the gameagainst the Los Angeles Kings on Nov. 5 and reported "ongoing discomfort" days later while the team was in New York to play the Islanders.</p>
      <p>Head coach Mike Babcock told reporters Friday he does not know what the timeline for Kerfoot's recovery looks like.</p>
      <p>"I didn't have the courage to ask," he said, <a href="https://twitter.com/kristen_shilton/status/1195380201678626817">via TSN's Kristen Shilton</a>.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old center has scored five goals and recorded three assists through 20 games in his first season with the Leafs. Kerfoot was acquired from the Colorado Avalanche,along with defenseman Tyson Barrie,<a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/ca/nhl/news/nhl-trade-news-maple-leafs-acquire-tyson-barrie-alex-kerfoot-send-nazem-kadri-to-avalanche/1jpp7vjwz8swvz43rkhqp71mt">in an offseason trade</a>that sent Nazem Kadri and Calle Rosen to the Avs.</p>
      <p>Kerfoot, who averages over two minutes of ice time on Toronto's power play each game,joins <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/ca/nhl/news/mitch-marner-injury-update-toronto-maple-leafs-forward-leaves-game-ankle-injury/1ld9soe6ges0h1j8khj6e26gnc">star forward Mitch Marner</a> on the injury report. This new one comes just aftertop-six forward <a href="https://www.thestar.com/sports/leafs/2019/11/13/leafs-zach-hyman-back-after-a-rehab-that-felt-like-forever-mitch-marner-just-about-to-get-started.html">Zach Hyman finally made his season debut</a> on Wednesday, ensuring Toronto remains shy of a fully healthy lineup for at least several more weeks.</p>
      <p>Veteran center Jason Spezza <a href="https://twitter.com/markhmasters/status/1195363631107575808">reportedly skated in Kerfoot's third-line spot</a> in the team's first practice after the injury was announced.</p>
      <p>The Maple Leafs hold a 9-7-4record (22 points)through Nov. 14, which places them just barely on theoutside looking in at the Eastern Conference playoff picture.</p>
