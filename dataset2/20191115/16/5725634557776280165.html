      <p>This article is part of a series that provides an ongoing analysis of the changes made to Berkshire Hathaway's 13F stock portfolio on a quarterly basis. It is based on Warren Buffett's regulatory <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1067983/000095012319011362/0000950123-19-011362-index.htm">13F Form</a> filed on 11/14/2019. Please visit our <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/290216-tracking-10-years-of-berkshire-hathaway-s-investment-portfolio-part-1">Tracking 10 Years Of Berkshire Hathaway's Investment Portfolio</a> article series for an idea on how his holdings have progressed over the years and <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4285857-tracking-warren-buffetts-berkshire-hathaway-portfolio-q2-2019-update">our previous update</a> for the moves in Q2 2019.</p>
      <p>During Q3 2019, Berkshire Hathaway's (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRK.A">BRK.A</a>) (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRK.B">BRK.B</a>) 13F stock portfolio value increased ~3% from $208B to $215B. The top five positions account for two-thirds of the portfolio: Apple Inc. (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL">AAPL</a>), Bank of America (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BAC">BAC</a>), Coca-Cola (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KO">KO</a>), Wells Fargo (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WFC">WFC</a>), and American Express (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AXP">AXP</a>). There are 45 individual stock positions many of which are minutely small compared to the overall size of the portfolio.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=warren%20buffett%20letters&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=onfasbl02-20&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps">Warren Buffett's writings</a> (<a href="http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/letters.html">PDFS</a>) are a treasure trove of information and are a very good source for anyone starting out on individual investing.</p>
      <p>Note: In Q3 2019, Berkshire Hathaway repurchased ~2.2M Class B Equivalent Shares for a total outlay of $440M. The average price paid was ~$200. Book Value as of Q3 2019 was ~$162 per share. So, the repurchase happened at ~124% of Book Value. In July 2018, Berkshire had announced a plan to make their repurchase criteria to be more flexible - instead of the 120% of Book Value criteria, Buffett &amp; Munger had to agree that Berkshire was trading below intrinsic value. The Class B shares currently trade at ~$219.</p>
      <p>
        <b>New Stakes:</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Occidental Petroleum (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OXY">OXY</a>) and RH Inc.

      <p>Note: Berkshire also has warrants to purchase 80M shares of OXY at $62.50 per share. That came about as part of a $10B funding deal (perpetual preferred stock with 8% annual dividend) done in May. For investors attempting to follow, OXY is a good option to consider for further research.</p>
      <p>

      <p><b>Red Hat Inc. (NYSE:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RHT">RHT</a>)</b>: Red Hat was a 0.47% of the portfolio position established in Q4 2018 and increased by ~22% next quarter.
