      <p>A jury has retired in the trial of eight men accused of conspiracy to wound with intent and conspiracy to possess a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence.</p>
      <p>The jury was sent out on Friday, November 15, after hearing a summing up of the case from Judge Steven Coupland at <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/crime">Nottingham Crown Court.</a></p>
      <p>They will return on Monday, November 18, to continue their deliberations.</p>
      <p>During the trial, the jury heard four of the accused allegedly gathered weapons and went looking for three people from Radford they could "shoot, stab or batter" in the back of a van.</p>
      <p>A passenger was allegedly defendant Lewis Anderson, who was earlier "wound up" by the Radford men, say the prosecution.</p>
      <p>They filmed him on their mobile phones at a Co-op in Arnold Road, Bestwood, and "they were doing that to taunt him", Luke Blackburn, prosecuting, had said.</p>
      <p>Anderson, 25, of Thane Road, Nottingham, allegedly got hold of three other men to help him.</p>
      <p>"They got hold of a pistol, ammunition, two knives, a truncheon, three balaclavas, a woollen hat, two pairs of gloves," Mr Blackburn had said.</p>
      <p>"Four of them with weapons went looking for the Radford males that they could shoot, stab or batter in the back of a van.</p>
      <p>"The pistol was a working weapon. This wasn't about threats; this was about inflicting serious violence and injury."</p>
      <p>The jury heard the van had been parked in Belconnen Road, Bestwood, where Anderson was said to have left the vehicle carrying a white drawstring bag containing the pistol.</p>
      <p>Anderson allegedly looked around and returned to the van via its sliding door.</p>
      <p>The van was next seen on Lucknow Road, Mapperley Park, where <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/crime">police</a> moved in, the court heard</p>
      <p>Defendant Dean Johnson, 26, of Shakespeare Street, Nottingham, was allegedly the driver and the passengers were Anderson and two men who cannot be identified.</p>
      <p>Anderson, Johnson, Anton Daniels, 29, of Cairns Close, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/bestwood">Bestwood</a>, Trevan Dickson, 20, and Jason Dickson, 47, both of Ashover Close, St Ann's, and three defendants, who cannot be identified, plead not guilty to conspiracy to wound with intent and conspiracy to possess a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence.</p>
      <p>The remaining charges involve the men arrested in the van. Anderson, Johnson and two of those who cannot be identified deny three charges of having offensive weapons - a truncheon and two knives.</p>
      <p>The trial continues</p>
