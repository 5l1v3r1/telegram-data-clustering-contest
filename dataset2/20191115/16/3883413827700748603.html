      <p>His arrival will come as campaigning intensifies ahead of the snap General Election on 12 December. </p>
      <p>The summit will feature a reception hosted by the Queen at Buckingham Palace.</p>
      <p>Mr Trump has faced large-scale demonstrations on his two previous visits to London as US president.</p>
      <p>He has regularly expressed concern that many NATO members are not providing sufficient financial support for the military alliance.</p>
      <p>In June, Mr Trump said NATO "cannot rely on one nation to defend all".</p>

      <p>Only <a href="https://www.forces.net/news/world/nato-which-countries-pay-their-share-defence">seven out of the 29 nations</a> that make up NATO currently meet or exceed the alliance's target of spending 2% GDP on defence. </p>
      <p>Confirming Mr Trump's visit to London, a White House statement said: "President Trump looks forward to meeting with the other NATO heads of state and government to review the alliance's unprecedented progress on burden-sharing, including adding more than 100 billion dollars in new defence spending since 2016.</p>
      <p>"The president will also emphasise the need for the NATO alliance to ensure its readiness for the threats of tomorrow, including those emanating from cyberspace, those affecting our critical infrastructure and telecommunications networks, and those posed by terrorism."</p>
