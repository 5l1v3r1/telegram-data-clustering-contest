      <p>Former '<b>Produce 101</b>' contestant and now solo artist, <b>Jeong Dongsu</b>, currently going by the stage name '<b>Arkay</b>' posted on his Instagram account on November 15 to call out the vote-rigging scandal currently under investigation.</p>
      <p>He simply posted a selca and the caption,<i>"I'm digging into this and I'm also a victim."</i> He also posted some hashtags in his comments, "victim 1", "I feel lukewarm", "I don't want to shush", "punish the bad guys", "produce 101".</p>
      <p>It seems he is stating that he was not one of the trainee's that allegedly received partial treatment or advantages during the show's airing.</p>
      <p>For reference, during the show, he first placed 60th. But, he suddenly began to rise in the ranks. He placed 36th on episode 8, barely being cut off from the top 35 that continued to the next round.</p>
