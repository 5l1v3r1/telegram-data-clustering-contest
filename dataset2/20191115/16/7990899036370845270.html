      <p><b>Gracie Anne Muehlberger</b>, 15, has been identified as one of the students who died in a school shooting Thursday in Santa Clarita, California. The Los Angeles County coroner’s office named her on Friday, according to <a href="https://ktla.com/2019/11/15/saugus-high-school-shooting-15-year-old-girl-identified-as-one-of-two-students-killed-on-santa-clarita-campus/">KTLA</a>.</p>
      <p>Before Muehlberger was officially identified, authorities <a href="https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/shooting-reported-at-saugus-high-school-in-california-heres-what-we-know/">initially </a>said she was 16. She celebrated her 15th birthday last month. Muehlberger and a 14-year-old boy, who has not yet been identified, were shot and killed in the shooting at Saugus High School. The other victims have been described as a 14-year-old girl, a 15-year-old girl, and a 14-year-old boy.</p>
      <p>The father of one of the girls released a photo of her recovering in the hospital.</p>

      <p>Choir teacher <b>Katie Holt</b> described her vantage point of the shooting, and said she helped one of the teen girls who was shot.</p>
      <p>“She was shot in her side, and then she told me she thought she had been shot, as well, in her arm,” Holt said in an NBC News report <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/crime-courts/they-ll-never-be-same-santa-clarita-school-shooting-shatters-n1082691">on</a> Thursday. “I looked, and she had been shot in her shoulder, as well — but I only had one gunshot wound kit.”</p>
      <p>She said she applied the kit to the girl’s shoulder and asked a “really brave freshman” named <b>Tyler</b> to apply pressure, so she could then work on the side wound. The teacher said that she learned from the girl’s friends and family that she would be okay.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/us/santa-clarita-shooting-motive.html">The motive behind the shooting remains under unclear</a>. The suspect allegedly shot himself, and is in serious condition.</p>
