      <p><b>(KNOE) - </b>A noted Fox News' political anchor has called out President Donald Trump's tweet "ripping" former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch during her testimony before the House Intelligence Committee Friday morning.</p>
      <p>As the public impeachment hearings were underway on Friday, President Trump criticized the person at the center of the hearing, tweeting, "Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad. She started off in Somalia, how did that go? Then fast forward to Ukraine, where the new Ukrainian President spoke unfavorably about her in my second phone call with him. It is a U.S. Presidentâ€™s absolute right to appoint ambassadors."</p>

      <p>The tweet comes after what she calls a concerted effort to smear her reputation and ruin her career. Chairman Adam Schiff addressed the tweet on live TV, allowing Yovanovitch a chance to respond. She smiled, raised her eyebrows, and nodded her head while Schiff read the tweet aloud. She responded, "I don't think I have such powers," and went on to say that she thought she and her colleagues did a good job. She later shook her head and called the tweet "very intimidating."</p>
      <p>After the exchange, two top Fox News journalists shared their takes on the president's tweet about Tovanovitch. Fox News White House reporter John Roberts called the exchange "unprecedented." Fox News' Chief Political Anchor Bret Baier was critical of the president's tweet, calling it and the subsequent events "a turning point in this hearing so far" with some characterizing it to "adding an article of impeachment real-time." Baier later said they "talked about how it's a stretch to witness intimidation," but "a gift for D's."</p>

      <p>The Associated Press later addressed the president's claims, saying, <a href="https://www.knoe.com/content/news/564999092.html">"There's no credence to the notion that countries "turned bad" when Yovanovitch went to them."</a></p>
      <p>When asked later about the tweet, President Trump said, "I want freedom of speech." When asked if he thought his tweets and words can be "intimidating," the president responded, "I don't think so at all."</p>
