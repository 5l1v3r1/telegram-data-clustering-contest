      <p>A military veteran who developed PTSD after defending four people from a samurai sword-wielding attacker has credited wildlife photography with saving his life.</p>
      <p>Paul Williams, from Dorset, is a self-confessed alpha male.</p>
      <p>He had been a career soldier and later a physical training instructor until he shattered his ankles in a climbing accident.</p>
      <p>Injured, but undeterred, he changed tack and gained a first-class honours degree in clinical mental health nursing.</p>
      <p>However the lure of front-line work was too strong and he ultimately enlisted in the police.</p>
      <p>His life changed forever though when, aged 40, he developed PTSD defending people against a mentally-ill sword attacker while he was armed only with pepper spray.</p>

      <p>Paul said: ‘The dark times were very dark, with an almost constant desire to commit suicide, particularly when I’d accepted the diagnosis of PTSD, as I then knew that my career, and life as I knew it, was over.</p>

      <p>‘Much of this time was spent avoiding family, friends and colleagues to the point that I essentially became a recluse. Not great when you have five children who need you, and don’t understand what’s going on.’</p>
      <p>‘Part of my problem was emphatic denial that someone like me could ever get a mental illness. It took me nearly three years to fully accept it.’</p>
      <p>He eventually experienced a significant breakthrough with a new psychotherapy treatment called eye movement desensitisation reprogramming that, he said, offered him a window of hope and curbed his suicidal thoughts.</p>
      <p>He added: ‘I don’t think it’s a coincidence that, around the same time, I picked up my camera and began taking images of the wildlife in my garden.’</p>

      <p>Photography gave him the incentive to break his reclusive lifestyle and take satisfaction in sitting still in quiet spaces, waiting for wildlife to appear.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘At first, my mental state was so poor that I wasn’t capable of maintaining any kind of continuity, so I’d be out for the day, and then escape back home for several days.</p>
      <p>‘Gradually, I began to enjoy the time with nature more, and made an increased effort to seek it out, but still to the detriment of human contact: a situation that exists to this day in some shape or form.</p>
      <p>‘The image that changed everything for me was the picture of the Lorton owls, which I posted on social media. The post caught the eye of Dorset Wildlife Trust, and was the start of an awesome relationship that continues to this day.</p>

      <p>‘I produced the Trust’s 2019 calendar and it uses my images in its PR campaigns. I also run workshops on Brownsea Island for the Trust.</p>

        <figcaption>His book also tells the story of his journey to mental wellbeing (Picture: Paul Williams/METROGRAB)</figcaption>

      <p>‘I regard this as a pivotal point where, for the first time since becoming unwell, I had a role, and something to fill the vacuum left by loss of career, self identity, and my capacity as a father.’</p>
      <p>His collection of work has been published in the book ‘Wildlife Photography: Saving my life one frame at a time’  which tells of his journey from rock bottom to rediscovery.</p>
      <p>Paul said: ‘Looking back, I now know that finding the motivation to take these images when I was so unwell were important first steps on the road to my recovery.</p>
      <p>‘International travel is still particularly hard, as I struggle in busy places like airports, and absolutely hate sitting in a plane closely surrounded by people I don’t know.</p>
      <p>‘Once I’ve reached these wild places, though, I’m in my element, as they are usually devoid of people and I get so much out of the challenges that capturing hard-to-find wildlife involves.’</p>
