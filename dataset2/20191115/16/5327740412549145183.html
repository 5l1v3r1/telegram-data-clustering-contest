      <h1>CREA: national home sales up 12.9 per cent in October compared with last year</h1>
      <h2>Greater Vancouver’s composite index price was down 6.4 per cent from a year ago to $994,900</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T16:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.northdeltareporter.com/author/canadian-press-2/" target="_blank">The Canadian Press</a></address>
      <p>The Canadian Real Estate Association says the number of home sales was up 12.9 per cent nationally in October compared with the same month last year.</p>
      <p>It says sales activity last month was almost the same as for September, but up almost 20 per cent from a six-year low reached in February. Home sales are still about seven per cent below the heights reached in 2016 and 2017.</p>
      <p>CREA says sales activity was mixed across the country as growing sales in Greater Vancouver, the B.C. Fraser Valley, and Ottawa, was offset by a monthly decline in the Greater Toronto Area and Hamilton-Burlington.</p>
      <p>Greater Vancouver’s composite index price was down 6.4 per cent from a year ago to $994,900, while in the GTA, the index price was up 5.6 per cent to $814,400. Ottawa recorded the highest price gains of major cities with a 10.25 per cent climb to $436,300.</p>
      <p>Nationally, the composite index price was up 1.77 per cent to $633,600 despite declines in parts of B.C. as well as in major cities in Alberta and Saskatchewan.</p>
