        <i>Gunpowder London’s take on the classic gin-and-lime combo, with added ginger for some warming spice</i>
      </p>
      <p>Bow Barracks was an army mess built in my home town of Kolkata during the first world war. This is a pretty simple, classic gimlet, but it’s made with ginger syrup to give it some spice – if you don’t want to make your own syrup, use the syrup from a jar of stem ginger instead.</p>
      <p>Serves 1</p>
      <p>For the ginger syrup<br/><b>100g caster sugar</b><br/><b>100ml water</b><br/><b>4 tbsp peeled and grated fresh ginger</b></p>
      <p>For the drink<br/><b>2 tbsp gin </b>- we use <a href="https://www.bombaysapphire.com/uk/en/">Bombay Sapphire</a><br/><b>1 tsp freshly squeezed lime juice</b><br/><b>2 tbsp ginger syrup</b> (see above)<br/><b>1 thin slice fresh lime</b>, to garnish</p>
      <p>First make the syrup. Put the sugar, water and ginger in a pan, bring to a slow boil, then simmer for 10 minutes. While it’s still warm, strain through a fine sieve into a clean, sterilised jar, filling it right to the top, then seal. It will now keep for three months in a cool place.</p>
      <p>To make the drink, pour everything bar the lime slice in a shaker, add ice and shake hard for 10 seconds. Strain into chilled tumblers filled with ice, garnish and serve.</p>
