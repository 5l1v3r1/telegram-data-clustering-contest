      <h4>Pros</h4>
      <p>Powerful audio for the size. IPX7 waterproof rating. Can be personalized on JBL's site.</p>
      <h4>Cons</h4>
      <p>Mono. No speakerphone functionality or aux input.</p>
      <h4>Bottom Line</h4>
      <p>The JBL Flip 5 speaker delivers a strong Bluetooth audio experience in an outdoor-friendly design you can customize to your liking.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>JBL is no stranger to portable <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/computer-speaker-reviews/4110/guide/the-best-bluetooth-speakers-of-2017">Bluetooth speakers</a>, as evidenced by the $119.95 Flip 5, the latest entry in the popular line. Sonically, the speaker delivers quite a punch for its size and price—every new entry from JBL seems to deliver more bass depth than the dimensions and drivers should be capable of. An IPX7 rating, meanwhile, covers all the bases on the waterproofing front. And for an extra $30, you can even personalize the speaker with graphics you upload (see the snazzy PCMag design JBL sent us below). In short, there's very little to complain about here, though there are several compelling options worth your attention in this price range.</p>
      <h3>Design</h3>
      <p>The cylindrical Flip 5 measures 7.1 by 2.7 inches (HW) and weighs in at 1.2 pounds. It's available in 14 different color schemes, as well as a camouflage-themed design. As mentioned, for $30 more, you can customize the grille on the speaker to display uploaded art, or work with graphics JBL has on its site. We think ours turned out great, but one word of caution: very small lettering can get obscured by the grille's woven surface. The printing of the graphics for our custom model (designed by JBL for PCMag) looks crisp and clean in person, and the design even gets printed on the controls, which is cool.</p>
      <p>Speaking of controls, they are arrayed along the grille in a row. There's a button for Partyboost (a feature that allows you to connect to various other JBL speakers and have them all stream the same music), volume up, volume down, and play/pause. On a thin strip of plastic on the back of the speaker, there's a power button, a Bluetooth pairing button, a USB-C port for the included charging cable. The port is uncovered, which makes the <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/panasonic-toughbook-33-2-in-1-detachable-laptop/91730/feature/waterproof-dust-resistant-making-sense-of-gadget-ratings">IPX7 rating</a> all the more impressive—with this rating, the speaker can be submerged up to a meter, and can handle water pressure from a faucet, so it's perfect for poolside listening. There's also a lanyard loop, and the speaker ships with a shoelace-style lanyard, making it easy to hang on just about anything that can support its weight.</p>

      <p>The ends of the speaker house passive bass radiators that push out quite a bit of low-end, while the grille covers a 20-watt, 44-by-80mm driver delivering 65Hz to 20kHz. There's not going to be super-powerful sub-bass here, but the system does a good job of pushing out rich low and low-mid bass depth to make up for this.</p>
      <p>As mentioned, Partyboost allows you to stream the same music to multiple JBL speakers. In the free JBL Connect app, you can also select whether you want to make the Flip 5 part of a stereo pair, or if you want it to play both left and right channels in mono as part of a group. Other than this function, there's not much reason to download the app—it displays battery life and allows you to disable audio feedback for button presses. There's no adjustable EQ. There's also no speakerphone function on the speaker itself, nor a 3.5mm aux input.</p>
      <p>JBL estimates the Flip 5's battery life to be roughly 12 hours, but your results will vary with your volume levels.</p>
      <h3>Performance</h3>
      <p>On tracks with intense sub-bass content, like The Knife's "Silent Shout," the Flip 5 delivers impressive thump for its size. The bass doesn't distort at top volume levels, thanks to some DSP (digital signal processing) that thins out the deep lows. At more moderate volumes, the bass depth sounds thicker, but this is not a speaker capable of producing subwoofer-like depth. It makes up for it by pushing out the lows and low-mids with the help of the passive radiators.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Bill Callahan's "Drover," a track with far less deep bass in the mix, gives us a better sense of the Flip 5's general sound signature. The drums on this track can sound thunderous on bass-forward speakers, but here, they're less powerful. The lows have much more of a presence with Callahan's baritone vocals, which have an added richness to them. The high-mids and highs are also sculpted, lending the vocals some added definition and crispness, and the acoustic strums some extra brightness.</p>
      <p>It should be noted that depending on where you are in relation to the speaker, and whether it's sitting on its end or flat, can make a tremendous difference in terms of perceived treble response. Things never sound dull, but when the speaker is lined up with the ears, you're more likely to have a bright, crisp sound signature. You'll get roughly the same bass depth regardless of positioning.</p>

      <p>On Jay-Z and Kanye West's "No Church in the Wild," the kick drum loop gets plenty of high-mid presence, allowing its attack to retain its punchiness in the mix, while the loop's thump has a bit less bass oomph than you might hope for. This is also true of the sub-bass synth hits for reasons we described earlier—you'll hear them, but the truly deep bass is not part of the equation here. The vocals on this track are delivered with solid high-mid clarity, though there's definitely some added sibilance in play.</p>
      <p>Orchestral tracks, like the opening scene from John Adams' <i>The Gospel According to the Other Mary</i>, receive some added richness in the lows and low-mids that end up pushing the lower-register instrumentation forward in the mix. It's not over the top, and it's matched by sculpting in the high-mids and highs. This isn't a terribly accurate sound signature, but it's balanced.</p>
      <h3>Conclusions</h3>
      <p>For its size and price, the JBL Flip 5 delivers some powerful audio in a waterproof design. If you want truly thunderous bass, you'll need a larger speaker that costs more. We're quite comfortable recommending the Flip 5, but there are plenty of options in the sub-$200 realm worth considering. We're also fans of the $150 <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/sony-srs-xb32">Sony SRS-XB32</a> and the $200 <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/electronics/121166/urbanears-ralis">Urbanears Ralis</a>, for starters. And from JBL itself, you can get significantly more bass depth and a similarly outdoor-friendly build from the $180 <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/jbl-charge-4">JBL Charge 4</a>. The good news is that you'll be happy with any of these speakers, so you can't really go wrong.</p>
