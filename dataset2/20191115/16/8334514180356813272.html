      <p>ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey will not step back from its purchase of Russian S-400 missile defense systems, a senior aide to President Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday, two days after talks with U.S. President Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>Erdogan and Trump held talks in Washington on Wednesday to overcome mounting differences between the NATO allies, ranging from looming sanctions threats over Turkey’s purchase of S-400s and Syria policy. Washington says the S-400s pose a threat to its F-35 jets and has suspended Turkey’s involvement in the jet program.</p>
      <p>Speaking to broadcaster TRT Haber, Ibrahim Kalin said that Turkish and U.S. officials had begun work as part of a mechanism to evaluate the impact of the S-400s on the F-35 jets on Friday.</p>
