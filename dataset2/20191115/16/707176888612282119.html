      <p>Boris Johnson has insisted there is “no evidence” of Russian interference in the UK democratic process as calls mount for the prime minister to publish a report on the subject ahead of the general election.</p>
      <p>A 50-page assessment, conducted by parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC), was intended for publication before the House of Commons was dissolved on November 5 for the December poll.</p>
      <p>The report was sent to Mr Johnson on October 17, but he has refused to release it, prompting <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/796d4a8c-ffd9-11e9-be59-e49b2a136b8d">claims from the opposition that it is being suppressed </a>for fear of damaging the Conservative election campaign.</p>
      <p>It is normally up to Downing Street to decide when such reports are put into the public domain because of their sensitivity.</p>
      <p>Dominic Grieve MP, the committee chairman, said there was <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/98f34ce8-fd64-11e9-b7bc-f3fa4e77dd47">no reason for it not to be published </a>ahead of the December 12 election and insisted it might contain information that was “germane” to voters.</p>
      <p>Its contents have been signed off by intelligence agencies and senior Whitehall officials. Many senior intelligence experts have called on Mr Johnson to publish the report without delay.</p>
      <p>Asked if the report was being withheld from publication because he had “something to hide”, Mr Johnson told the BBC on Friday that was “absolutely not” the case. On the suggestion of Russian interference in UK politics, Mr Johnson said there was “no evidence of that”.</p>
      <p>He added: “I see absolutely no reason to change the normal procedures for publishing ISC reports just because there is an election coming. They are not normally published at that pace.”</p>

      <p>Questioned on whether he had refused to publish the report because it contained details of Russian oligarchs donating to the Tory party, he said: “All donations to the Conservative party are properly vetted and properly publicised.</p>
      <p>“These donations are all open to challenge. If people think that they’re not fit and proper persons then they’re not allowed to donate, that’s the rule. But I don’t think we should be hostile to people simply because of the country they come from. And it is very important that we show balance and fairness to them.”</p>
      <p>The ISC’s inquiry examines allegations of Russian activity in British politics, including the 2016 Brexit referendum, in which Mr Johnson was a leading campaigner for Leave.</p>
      <p>Speaking earlier this week during a visit to the UK, former US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said it was “inexplicable and shameful” that the government had not published the report.</p>
      <p>She said: “Every person who votes in this country deserves to see that report before your election happens.”</p>
