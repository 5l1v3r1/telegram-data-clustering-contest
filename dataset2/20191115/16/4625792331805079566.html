      <h1>Guilty on all counts: Roger Stone, longtime Trump confidant, convicted of lying, obstruction, and intimidation</h1>

      <p>Roger Stone, the longtime Republican operative, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/politics/smears-swingers-and-dirty-tricks-roger-stones-colorful-career-in-politics">flamboyant "dirty trickster</a>," and President Trump ally, lied to Congress, obstructed an investigation, and intimidated a witness, a jury found Friday.</p>
      <p>He was found guilty on five separate counts of lying to the House Intelligence Committee in addition to two more charges of obstructing a congressional investigation and intimidating a witness following a two-week trial that centered on the actions taken by the self-identified "dirty trickster" and GOP agent provocateur during the 2016 election and beyond.</p>
      <p>Stone, 67, now faces up to 50 years in prison, a maximum of 20 alone for the most serious charge. Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who has presided over the case since January, will hand down Stone's sentence in February.</p>
      <p>The jury found Stone repeatedly misrepresented and concealed his 2016 attempt at collaborating with WikiLeaks and founder Julian Assange to obtain dirt on then-candidate Hillary Clinton and stolen emails when speaking with Trump-Russia investigators from the House Intelligence Committee in a spin-off case from special counsel <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/read-robert-muellers-redacted-russia-report">Robert Mueller’s two-year investigation</a>.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/five-categories-of-lies-prosecutor-says-roger-stone-should-go-to-prison-to-show-truth-still-matters">charges against Stone</a> included one count he “corruptly influenced, obstructed, and impeded” the congressional investigation and another that he attempted to “corruptly persuade” Randy Credico’s congressional testimony. Stone also faced five counts of making “materially false, fictions, and fraudulent statements” to Congress.</p>
      <p>After the jury handed down its verdict, Assistant U.S. Attorney Aaron Zelinsky argued that Stone should be held in prison for the next few months pending his official prison sentence.</p>
      <p>Stone had demonstrated an “unwillingness or inability to abide by the conditions of release,” Zelinsky said, referencing discussions Stone reportedly had with InfoWars conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who claimed Thursday evening that Stone had called him on Thursday and asked him to deliver a message.</p>
      <p>“It’s Roger Stone’s request that if he’s convicted you call the White House,” Jones said, adding that if Stone was found guilty, his listeners should “encircle the White House with bullhorns demanding that President Trump take action.”</p>
      <p>Stone’s attorney, Bruce Rogow, claimed to not know whether what Jones had said was true, but argued that during the course of the trial, Stone “has complied with everything has been required of him.”</p>
      <p>The judge noted that Stone’s communications with Jones, if true, likely violated the gag order that she’d placed on him. But she said she would not keep him in custody, and she had “no reason to believe he won’t be here for his next court appearance.”</p>
      <p>The gag order, which prevents him from speaking to the media about his case or posting on social media, is in place through February.</p>
      <p>“I continue to have serious concern about some of the publicity that has attended some of these proceedings,” Jackson said.</p>
