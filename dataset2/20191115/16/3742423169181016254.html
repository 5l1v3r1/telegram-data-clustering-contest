      <p>It’s like Microsoft knew. We just talked about <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2019/11/how-to-save-big-on-an-xbox-game-pass-subscription">a handful of ways</a> you can get an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription for an absurdly low price, and here’s one more method to add to your collection. Thanks to a Microsoft promo, new Game Pass Ultimate subscribers can now get <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/p/xbox-game-pass-ultimate/cfq7ttc0khs0?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab">three months of the service for $1</a> instead of the customary one month.</p>

      <p>Since three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate normally costs you $47.95, you’re saving quite a bit of cash with this promotion—and you can probably get a lot crazier with it, too. As we’ve mentioned, if Microsoft offers you the option to sign up for recurring billing for the subscription (which you can cancel immediately after), you might be able to get an extra free month for your subscription, boosting your savings to $US59 ($86).</p>
      <p>(If you’re looking to keep the service for years, I’d go for the Xbox Live Gold-to-Xbox Game Pass Ultimate <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-au/live/gold/upgrade">upgrade</a>, myself, but that’s just me.)</p>
      <p>Even if you don’t want to get too crazy with deals, promotions, and upgrades, the three-months-for-a-buck deal is still pretty solid, so long as you remember to cancel your subscription so it ends on the expiration date so you don’t get billed for additional service. Three months is plenty of time to finish <a href="http://www.kotaku.com.au/2019/10/tips-for-playing-the-outer-worlds"><i>The Outer Worlds</i></a>, right?</p>
