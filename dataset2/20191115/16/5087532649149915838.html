      <h1>The 16-Inch MacBook Pro Provides Plenty of Reasons to go Back to Mac</h1>

      <p>The new 16-inch MacBook Pro has certainly generated a lot of excitement. <i>Cult of Mac</i>‘s Charlie Sorrell said the device will be the first new Mac he has bought in six years.</p>
      <blockquote>The thing that really makes me want a new Mac right now is that macOS and iOS are now very tightly integrated. Handoff means you really can switch between devices at will, even when working on the same article. And Sidecar means that I can use touch, and the Apple Pencil, on Mac apps like Ableton Live and Logic. And all the while, I can enjoy the superior customization options of the Mac. It’s a win-win. Albeit a really expensive one. If I wasn’t in a hurry to move (partially) back to the Mac, I’d wait for the MacBook Air to get its keyboard replaced, or for the first ARM Mac to appear. As it is, I’m happy buying the 16-inch MacBook Pro.</blockquote>
