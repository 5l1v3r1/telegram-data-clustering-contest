      <p>The former monopoly is pressing ahead with plans to find one or more funds to help it buy out Open Fiber and create a national champion that can roll out a single broadband network to avoid duplicating investments.</p>
      <p>Open Fiber, a wholesale-only fast broadband operator, is jointly owned by state-controlled utility Enel and state lender CDP. CDP is also TIM’s second-largest shareholder.</p>
      <p>Sources said more than a dozen infrastructure and sovereign wealth funds had been invited to present non-binding offers for Open Fiber by Nov. 19.</p>
      <p>“The idea is that the funds will present a valuation for Open Fiber which will take into account the last-mile fiber assets that TIM will fold into the company,” a source close to one of the interested funds said.</p>
      <p>The fund, or funds, are expected to buy around half of Open Fiber with TIM taking a stake of up to half though the structure is still under discussion, sources have said.</p>
      <p>TIM did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
      <p>One of the stumbling blocks to the creation of a single network has been how much Open Fiber is worth with analyst estimates fluctuating in a range of 1.5-4.0 billion euros ($1.65-$4.4 billion).</p>
      <p>TIM’s last-mile network - the bit that goes from the street to homes - has traditionally been copper but since 2016 it has been rolling out a fiber-to-the-home network through Flash Fiber, a joint venture with rival Fastweb</p>
      <p>“What’s clear is that TIM needs to bring its clients into play if any fast-fiber plan is to get over the line,” the source said.</p>
      <p>Rome has long been pushing for an all-fiber optic network with some state oversight to boost productivity across a country which has one of the lowest take-ups of fixed broadband in Europe.</p>
      <p>TIM, which has net debt of 24 billion euros, owns a large part of Italy’s wholesale market and has more than half the retail market.</p>
      <p>TIM CEO Luigi Gubitosi recently said only 20-25% of TIM’s ultra-broadband capacity was used by consumers and only 10-15% of Open Fiber’s, raising questions over returns on investments.</p>
      <p>Last week Gubitosi said TIM aimed to select one or more infrastructure funds for a deal with Open Fiber by year-end.</p>
