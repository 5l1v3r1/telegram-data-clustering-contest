      <p>2009<br/><br/>London Dreams <br/><br/>London Dreams was a story of two close friends and how fame, power and stardom brings about issues in their relation. Arjun (Ajay Devgn) was always focused on being successful musician and when he grows up, he manages to travel to London and make his very own band. Apart from Arjun, the band also features Zoheb (Rannvijay Singh) and Wasim (Aditya Roy Kapoor). Later, they bring aboard Priya (Asin), a singer from a conservative south Indian family. Arjun’s childhood friend Mannu (Salman Khan) joins him in London and decides to be a part of the band as well. Initially, Arjun is glad about working with his best friend, but soon the happiness turns into hate. During the concerts, Arjun notices that Manu is growing pretty popular with the crowds and he feels threatens by this. Arjun begins to develop feelings for Priya but when he learns that she and Mannu are already dating, his rage grows even further. Arjun decides to get Mannu addicted to drugs and later gets him arrested. No matter how hard Mannu tribes to get his life back on track, Arjun comes in his way. In the end, he does realise his mistakes and comes clean to everyone. While the first half of the Aditya Roy Kapur movie isn’t too bad, the second half kills any interest that you might have in the plot since it feels too dragged.</p>

      <p>2010 <br/><br/>Action Replayy <br/><br/>Action Replayy was loosely based on the popular Hollywood series Back To The Future. However, director Vipul Shah claimed that it is an adaptation of a Gujarati play of the same name. The Aditya Roy Kapur movie revolves around a man named Bunty (Aditya Roy Kapur), who’s fed up with the constant arguments and fights between his parents Kishen (Akshay Kumar) and Mala (Aishwarya Rai). While his parents are on the verge of a divorce, he uses a time machine to get back and fix his parents’ messed up relation. After several failed attempts, he manages to actually manages to get his parents to fall in love. When he comes back to the present time, he notices that the vibe in his home has taken a complete u-turn. His parents seem to be enjoying each other’s company instead of trying to strangle each other’s throats. This also eliminates Bunty’s constant fear of marriage and commitment in general.</p>

      <p>Guzaarish <br/><br/>Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Guzaarish was a film that told us a story about Ethan Mascarenhas (Hrithik Roshan). Ethan is a paralysed magician who starts his own radio show after the accident that changed his life. Going by his radio show, you’d never imagine that he’s suffering from a terrible condition as he was so full of life and would bring a smile on peoples faces through his wit. But, little did they know that he was already dead on the inside. On the 14th Anniversary of his accident, Ethan files a petition in court for mercy killing despite a stern opposition from his nurse Sophia (Aishwarya Rai Bachchan), who’s been serving him from the past 12 years. In the meantime, he also takes young Omar Siddiqui (Aditya Roy Kapur) in his wing and decides to pass on his legacy. Omar was fascinated by magic and thinks of Ethan as his ideal. On the day of the verdict, Ethan learns that the court has rejected his plea. Later on, he decides to turn on his decision and live the days he has left to the fullest. Although the Aditya Roy Kapur movie had a touching storyline and some stunning performances, it failed to impress the audience and tanked at the box-office.</p>

      <p>2013 <br/><br/>Aashiqui 2 <br/><br/>Aashiqui 2 was a successor to the 1990 musical film Aashiqui, which was a massive hit as well. The story of this Aditya Roy Kapur movie's plot is loosely based on a film titled A Star is Born. While the original was a massive hit amongst the audience, Aashiqui 2 went on to become Vishesh Films highest grossing film of all time. The film starts off with a large crowd waiting for Rahul Jaykar (Aditya Roy Kapur) – a successful singer and musician whose career is waning because of his alcohol addiction. He happens to meet Aarohi Keshav (Shraddha Kapoor) a bar singer who idolises Rahul. Impressed by her beautiful voice, Rahul decides to turn mentor for her and establishes her as a successful playback singer. </p>

      <p>However, during Aarohi’s rise to fame, Rahul’s alcohol addiction keeps getting worse and results in him turning violent and aggressive. One day, Rahul overhears Aarohi’s conversation in which she said she’ll give up her singing career to look after him since Rahul was more important to her than anyone. After which Rahul ends up suiciding as he realises that he’s become a burden on Aarohi’s life. The songs like Tum Hi Ho, Sun Raha Hai Na Tu etc from the film became extremely popular and played a major part in the Aditya Roy Kapur movie's success.</p>

      <p>Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani <br/><br/>Who doesn’t like a fun rom com stuffed with comedy and drama? Well, Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani gives you just that. The film brought together the much loved pairing of Ranbir Kapoor and Deepika Padukone and also featured Aditya Roy Kapur and Kalki. Koelchin. The Ayan Mukerji directorial followed a pretty standard Bollywood formula - a guy and girl, who are completely different in terms of their personalities, happened to meet and even though these differences lead to many arguments and fights, they eventually grow to like each other and fall in love. But the film clicked with the audience firstly due to the casts’ incredible performances and the execution of Ayan Mukerji, who was just one film old at the time. The audience loved watching Ranbir and Deepika on screen again and they lead stars were also supported well by Aditya and Kalki, who play the characters of Ranbir’s friends in the film. Another massive plus point to the film Pritam's music. It's soulful throughout and adds a lot to the Aditya Roy Kapur movie. Kabira, Ilahi and Balam Picharki from the film went on to become chartbusters. <br/><br/>Daawat - E - Ishq <br/><br/>Daawat - E - Ishq was a film that brought together the pairing of Aditya Roy Kapur and Parineeti Chopra for the very first time on the big screen. This rom - com, was different from others since in this one we see two people bond over food. Gullu (Parineeti Chopra) lives in Hyderabad and is in love with a man named Amjad (Karan Wahi). While the two want to get married, Amjad family asks for a dowry which Gullu and her father cannot afford. Enraged by this, Gullu decides to trap a dowry hungry groom for money and fulfil her dream of going to America. She poses as a rich women named Sania and meets up Tariq (Aditya Roy Kapur) and his family. During the days before the wedding, Gullu ends up falling for Tariq. Tariq also expresses his frustration of the dowry ritual so gives her some money and to her surprise, he gives her Rs. 40 lakhs in cash from his own savings, which his father asked for dowry. Gullu feels extremely guilty but decides to go ahead with her plan leaving Tariq heartbroken. Before she’s heading to the USA, she’s confronted by Tariq. She immediately returns the stolen money and confesses her love for him. They reunite and plan a real wedding without any dowry. Both Aditya and Parineeti did an excellent job transforming themselves completely into authentic Hyderabadi - Lucknowi locals. The Aditya Roy Kapur movie went on to have an average run at the box-office. <br/><br/>Fitoor <br/><br/>A poor boy named Noor (Aditya Roy Kapur) is hired as a stable keeper by a rich household. He falls for the daughter of the house Firdaus (Katrina Kaif) but faces strong opposition from her mother Hazrat (Tabu). Hazrat tells Noor that he belongs from the lower strata of the society and the only way he can get Firdaus if he establishes his name in the society and makes something of himself. Noor then works his way from the bottom and manages to turn into a successful artist. However, it comes to his realisation that he was cheated all along. While the film had great potential it suffered from a misguided story &amp; bland narrative. Even though the film is beautifully shot and has several moments of power the end result proves to be underwhelming. Even though it tries hard to make you feel the pain of Noor, it falls short as you simply don’t feel invested. While Aditya and Katrina do a commendable job for their parts, it is Tabu who ultimately steals the show as the terrifying yet grief-sticken Begum. Ajay Devgn too feels wasted in a half baked cameo in the Aditya Roy Kapur movie.</p>

      <p>OK Jaanu <br/><br/>OK Jaanu was a typical romantic drama based on Mani Ratnam's Tamil film O Kadhal Kanmani, starring Dulquer Salmaan and Nithya Menon. While a lot of elements in the Aditya Roy Kapur movie are cliche, it does make for a fun and entertaining watch. Adi (Aditya Roy Kapur) is a video game developer who meets Tara (Shraddha Kapoor) an aspiring architect. They develop a close bond and decide to move in together. </p>

      <p>The two have a lot of fun while together but realise that they soon will have to separate since they’ll be moving to different countries in order to pursue their careers. So, they decided to make the most of the time that have together before parting ways. However, when the time to separate arrives, they realise that they cannot live with each other and decide to get married. All in all Ok Jaanu is a simple, light-headed movie that would make you smile.</p>

      <p>Kalank <br/><br/>Kalank was touted as one of the biggest films of the year 2019 thanks to a massive star cast and the backing of the Dharma banner. Set in the pre-independent India in the city of Husnabad, in the start of the film we see Satya Chaudhry learning that she’s suffering from cancer and doesn’t have long to live. Upon realising this, she heads back to her native village and requests her childhood friend, Roop (Alia Bhatt), to provide companionship to her husband, Dev Chaudhry (Aditya Roy Kapur) who runs a liberal newspaper along with his father Balraj Chaudhry (Sanjay Dutt). </p>

      <p>When Roop moves in the Chaudhry house, she happens to meet Zafar in the city. Zafar aims to seduce Roop as he wants to exact revenge from Balraj for abandoning him and his mother Bahaar Begum (Madhuri Dixit). The Aditya Roy Kapur movie failed to live up to the expectations of people and that was pretty evident in the box-office figures the film was able to manage.</p>
