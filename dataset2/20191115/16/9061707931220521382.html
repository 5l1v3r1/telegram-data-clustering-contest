      <h1>Lisa Bennett murder trial hears claim she was 'drowned in the bath' by couple</h1>
      <h2>Man and woman on trial deny killing her</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T16:35:50+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 16:35</time> by <a rel="author">Beth Pridding, Charlotte Paxton</a></address>
      <p>Burton woman Lisa Bennett was drowned in the bath after being told she had eaten her "last dinner", it has been claimed in court.</p>
      <p>Kevin Flanagan and his girlfriend Kathleen Salmond are both currently on trial at Birmingham Crown Court, charged with murdering <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/burton/lisa-bennett-flanagan-salmond-murder-2915751">39-year-old Lisa Bennett in 2013</a>. They both deny the offence.</p>
      <p>Salmond who is now "largely confined to a bed or a wheelchair", and 39-year-old Flanagan, are alleged to have murdered Miss Bennett at their flat in Weirbrook Close in the Weoley Castle area of Birmingham on or around May 9, 2013.</p>
      <p>The jury heard how the defendants "reaped the benefit of Lisa's disappearance" after 40-year-old Salmond phoned the Department for Work and Pensions and pretended to be Miss Bennett while asking for the Â£230 benefit to be paid into her own account, it has been claimed.</p>
      <p>The prosecution also allege that Flanagan used Miss Bennett's phone to text her mother "to make her believe that nothing had happened and Lisa was alive".</p>

      <p>The court heard the couple had "calmly" told police that Miss Bennett was "alive and well" and that she had asked them to transfer her benefits into Salmond's account.</p>
      <p>The couple allegedly told officers that Miss Bennett's new boyfriend, Ian, would collect it every week for her - a boyfriend which the prosecution claims did not exist.</p>
      <p>The jury was told Miss Bennett was a drug and alcohol addict - and was not seen again after collecting her prescribed substitute for heroin from a pharmacy.</p>
      <p>Salmond, of Farnhurst Road, Hodge Hill, Birmingham, and Flanagan, of Redbrook Covert, Kings Norton, Birmingham, deny murder.</p>
      <p>Salmond, who appeared via video link from a bed, also denies benefit fraud between May 8 and 31, 2013, and preventing Miss Bennett's burial - charges which Flanagan has previously admitted.</p>
      <p>Opening the case against the defendants, prosecutor Simon Denison QC said: "Lisa died in their flat, on or around May 9, 2013. Her body has never been found. She has no grave.</p>
      <p>"The prosecution case is that the defendants murdered her, and then callously disposed of her body in the communal bins opposite their flat, where it lay undiscovered before the bins were emptied and the contents were taken to the council waste disposal facility a few days later.</p>
      <p>"There, her <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/burton/burton-woman-murdered-dumped-communal-3534337">body was incinerated with the community's waste</a>.</p>

      <p>"What they did, we suggest, was carry out a plan - to kill her, to conceal her body so it wouldn't be found, to lie and lie, and lie in pretending that she was alive, and to take her money for themselves.</p>
      <p>"It is an almost-inhuman thing to do, is it not, to treat not just a human body but the body of someone they knew, as a piece of rubbish to be thrown away."</p>
      <p>Mr Denison told the court Flanagan's brother only came forward in 2014 after seeing a televised public appeal for information.</p>
      <p>Speaking of the appeal, Mr Denison said: "It included pleas by Lisa's mother Janet and her sister Lindsay for anyone who knew anything to come forward.</p>
      <p>"Kevin Flanagan's older brother Joseph Flanagan saw it. He didn't come forward straight away, but he did come forward in November 2014.</p>
      <p>"Joseph Flanagan told the police that one evening... Kevin Flanagan, his brother, told him that he and Kathleen Salmond had murdered Lisa."</p>
      <p>Mr Denison alleged: "He said that Kevin Flanagan had told him that on the day they killed her, Salmond and Lisa had gone to Selly Oak to pick up her prescription.</p>
      <p>"Lisa had stolen some meat from a shop while they were in Selly Oak. He said Lisa was suicidal and wanted to die but she couldn't do it herself.</p>

      <p>"Kevin Flanagan told his brother that they decided that he and Kathleen would do it for her.</p>
      <p>"That evening they cooked the meat at their flat, and they were saying to Lisa that it would be 'her last dinner'. They then drowned Lisa in their bath.</p>
      <p>"Once she was dead, they wrapped her body and put it into a wheelie bin," he claimed.</p>
      <p>Addressing why Flanagan's brother had come forward, Mr Denison said: "When he saw the TV appeal he realised what his brother had told him was true, and seeing Lisa's mother not knowing what had happened to her daughter, when he did know, had affected him to the extent that he had to come forward, even though he said he loved his brother."</p>
      <p>The trial continues.</p>
