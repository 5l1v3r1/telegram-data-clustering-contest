      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/robbie-williams/">Robbie Williams</a> reached out to record a duet of Fairytale of New York with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/britney-spears/">Britney Spears</a>, and it would have been like Christmas come early if he’d pulled it off.</p>
      <p>The Angels singer has blessed us all with a new album – The Christmas Present – full of festive covers and some original bops.</p>
      <p>But the 45-year-old admitted he couldn’t coax the Toxic star into the studio with him for a collaboration.</p>
      <p>Speaking about why The Pogues’ banger didn’t make the list, he explained: ‘I wanted to do it with Britney Spears, but she’s not working, unfortunately.’</p>
      <p>While Brit might be missing from the album, Jamie Cullum, Rod Stewart, Bryan Adams and even Tyson Fury have all got in on the action.</p>
      <p>And the Take That legend is adamant that the Christmas Present isn’t just a ‘stop-gap’ but something he has put a solid three years of his life into.</p>

      <p>‘I wouldn’t call it a stopgap, because you don’t spend three years writing a stop-gap, but it’s nice to take the pressure off,’ <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/pa75ev/robbie-williams-interview-2019-tabloids-christmas-present-album">he added to Vice</a>.</p>

      <p>‘That said, I’ve put a lot of time and effort into getting it right.’</p>
      <p>This will be among our favourite Christmas presents this year…</p>
      <p>As well as a festive album, Robbie recently confirmed he would be <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/12/robbie-williams-confirms-second-las-vegas-residency-let-entertain-already-11087644/">embarking on another Las Vegas residency</a>, kicking things off next year.</p>
      <p>Because who needs rest?</p>

      <p>Ayda Field’s husband announced the news on Instagram, months after his first stint came to an end.</p>
      <p>‘I’m so excited to be returning to Las Vegas next year x ”Robbie Williams Live in Las Vegas” returns to Wynn Las Vegas in March and April 2020,’ he told fans.</p>
      <p>At this stage, he’ll perform eight shows from 24 March, going through to 4 April.</p>
      <p>And we absolutely cannot wait.</p>
