      <h1>PLN/USD: Temporary Dip, But Upside Remains</h1>

      <p>Summary</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The zloty has seen a temporary dip against the greenback.</li>
        <li>However, appetite for emerging market currencies appears to be on the rise.</li>
        <li>I take a bullish view on PLN/USD.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Last month, I made the <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4296992-pln-usd-upside-expected">argument</a> that the Polish zloty would continue to see upside against the greenback.</p>
      <p>The PLN/USD saw upside up until the 0.263 level – at which point the zloty began to retreat.</p>

      <p>A significant reason for this has been due to strength in the greenback rather than weakness in the zloty. With October <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/01/business/economy/jobs-report.html">employment</a> figures in the United States having been highly encouraging, the Federal Reserve decided that it would “pause” any further rate cuts after the most recent one – indicating that geopolitical tensions are not having as much an impact on economic growth as once feared – and the dollar has been seeing strength as a result.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, the Polish central bank is anticipating weaker domestic growth – and this is a likely reason for the pullback in the zloty – as well as taking dollar strength into consideration.</p>
      <p>Specifically, growth is expected to slow to 3.6% in 2020 – down from an expected growth rate of <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/cee-markets-zloty-falls-as-polish-central-bank-forecasts-growth-slowdown-2019-11-12">4.3%</a> for this year.</p>
      <p>Additionally, inflation <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-06/currency-gain-cements-stable-rates-in-poland-decision-day-guide">forecasts</a> appear to be heading back downwards towards the 2.5% goal – which means it is unlikely that the central bank will need to raise interest rates to counter higher inflation.</p>
      <p>That said, the Polish zloty has been at the top of the leaderboard in terms of gains on emerging market currencies for the month of October:</p>

      <p>Moreover, while the currency has come under pressure as a result of growth concerns – the fact that U.S. growth has remained strong is quite a good sign – it means that the recessionary risks arising from geopolitical tensions do not appear to be as stark as first feared – and this could in fact have the effect of weakening the dollar over time while we see a rebound in appetite for emerging market currencies like the zloty.</p>
      <p>In this regard, I continue to remain bullish on the PLN/USD. While the currency has had a temporary pullback, I anticipate that the currency could hit the 0.263 level again before the year is out.</p>
