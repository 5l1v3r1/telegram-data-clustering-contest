      <h1>Corey Anderson claims Jon Jones is avoiding him: He knows it’s a risky fight</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T16:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author">Milan Ordoñez</a></address>
      <p>Corey Anderson has many reasons why he feels he won’t get his title shot. From pinning the blame on the UFC for <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/5/20948955/ufc-244-anderson-states-case-for-title-shot-my-win-is-more-relevant-than-reyes-over-weidman-mma-news">depriving him</a> of it, he now points to champion Jon Jones as the root of the problem.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been saying it since last year when I called for the fight. He tweeted me saying, ‘You want the smoke?’ I answered back I want it right now,” he recently told <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/11/14/20952979/corey-anderson-believes-jon-jones-is-avoiding-him-fires-back-at-anthony-smith">MMA Fighting</a>. “All of a sudden, he started dilly-dallying around my name, calling other people out.</p>
      <p>“He’s avoiding me. He called me out thinking I would hesitate. I want that. I need that. I wanted that when I came here.</p>
      <p>“When you look back at UFC 181, I beat Justin Jones, and I said back then I beat a Jones, but the goal is to beat the Jones with the belt,” he added. “I want it. I think he knows it’s a dangerous fight. It’s a risky fight.”</p>
      <p>“Bones” recently announced his next challenger as Dominick Reyes, whom he says he’ll be fighting “<a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/14/20964388/jon-jones-wont-hold-out-for-money-games-says-hes-fighting-dominick-reyes-in-a-few-weeks">in a few weeks</a>.” Anderson, however, still feels he’s more worthy.</p>
      <p>“All these guys he fights are one-dimensional,” he said of his contemporaries. “Dominick Reyes is a great striker, but he doesn’t have the best wrestling defense. He has OK jiu-jitsu. Thiago [Santos], we knew he was a striker, but that was it. We knew Anthony Smith, his only chance was if you gas out and you let him get you down or some sh-t, or he gets you at the end.</p>
      <p>“But when you’ve got a guy like me who has the cardio, who has the striking, and has the wrestling the same or better than Jon Jones, as well as the jiu-jitsu that can match him, then it’s like, that’s a tricky fight — does he want that fight right now, or does he want to keep getting these easy wins, stack his bread and keep breaking records?”</p>
      <p>Anderson defeated rising prospect Johnny Walker at UFC 244 early this month via first-round knockout.</p>
