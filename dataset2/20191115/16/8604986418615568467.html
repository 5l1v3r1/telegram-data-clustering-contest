      <h1>Success in the Workplace is Actually About Conscientiousness, Not Competition</h1>
      <h2>Forget cutthroat tactics in the workplace. This study says bleeding hearts are better than bleeding out.</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.inc.com/marcel-schwantes/end-frustration-of-interviewing-job-candidates-with-5-simple-methods.html">Hiring in past generations</a> meant looking for team members who were driven, <a href="https://www.inc.com/peter-economy/11-inspiring-quotes-about-remarkable-power-of-being-assertive.html">assertive</a>, maybe even a little aggressive in pursuing their goals. Phrases like<a href="https://www.inc.com/alyssa-satara/is-toxic-masculinity-ruining%C2%A0your-workplace-heres-how-you-can-find-out%C2%A0and-end-it.html"> "dog eat dog" and "rat race"</a> were coined for a reason, after all. Capitalism is a competition both in between teams and inside them, right?</p>
      <p>But a new study finds the personality trait that predicts success at work more than any other is associated with some very different tendencies: I'm talking about conscientiousness.</p>
      <p>"Conscientiousness is the most potent, non-cognitive predictor of workplace performance," says University of Toronto-Scarborough researcher and study leader Michael Wilmot, in <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/news/being-conscientious-one-strongest-predictors-success-workplace-u-t-study-finds">a release</a>.</p>
      <p>When we talk about personality, conscientiousness means being diligent, considerate of others, orderly, in control of oneself and generally playing by the rules.</p>
      <p>Perhaps not surprisingly, research has shown for years that this overall trait is a strong predictor for all sorts of key positive outcomes such as academic and work success, marital stability, a long life and well being.</p>
      <p>For the new study, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/46/23004">published in the journal <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i></a>, data was used from dozens of earlier studies across countries, occupations and career milestones, from education to job application and evaluation. Researchers looked at how conscientiousness relates to 175 work-related variables including motivation, performance and emotional well-being. </p>
      <p>It turns out that conscientiousness has a far stronger impact on these variables than other personality traits such as extroversion, which is often extolled in the workplace and also linked to predicting success.</p>
      <p>"One of the more interesting things is that it predicts an absence of counterproductivity really well," says Wilmot, now a research scientist at the Human Resources Research Organization. "People who are higher in conscientiousness just don't engage in those types of destructive, disruptive behaviours."</p>
      <p>This might not be all that surprising: that being thoughtful is a plus when working with other humans, or that it also correlates with being goal-oriented, reliable and dependable.</p>
      <p>But the study did reveal that conscientiousness isn't as strong a superpower in all settings. Wilmot said the positive benefits of the trait did appear to be a little weaker in high complexity jobs. </p>
      <p>"It will be important for organizations to consider other measures, such as cognitive ability measures or other personality measures like openness to better forecast performance in more complex jobs," he says.</p>
      <p>In recent years there's been lots of research and talk about the importance of traits like self-control and grit, which is really a mono-syllabic way of saying perserverance. But Wilmot suggests they're really a part of the same larger trait.</p>
      <p>"It's kind of like conscientiousness is the mother construct and these are the children - these sub-traits fall under the umbrella of conscientiousness."</p>
      <p>So remember team, it's back scratching over back stabbing. Consensual, workplace-appropriate back scratching, that is. A conscientious person will know what I mean.</p>
