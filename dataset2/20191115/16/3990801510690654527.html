      <p>Global food giant Nestlé has <a href="http://www.carrefour.com/current-news/nestle-and-carrefour-apply-blockchain-technology-to-infant-nutrition-for-the-first-time">teamed up</a> with French supermarket chain Carrefour to put baby milk formula on the blockchain.</p>
      <p>Using IBM‘s food-tracking blockchain software <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/10/08/ibm-food-blockchain-trust/">IBM Food Trust</a>, the two firms will provide customers with transparent information for the GUIGOZ Bio 2 and 3 infant milk ranges, “from dairy to shelf.”</p>
      <p>IBM Food Trust is based on the Linux Foundation’s <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/8QABQBDR">Hyperledger Fabric</a> software.</p>
      <p>Like other blockchain-enabled products, consumers will be able to access this information by scanning a QR-code printed on the product’s packaging.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Carrefour <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/04/17/carrefour-blockchain-cryptocurrency-tracking/">revealed</a> its intention to put at least 20 percent of its “in-house” products on the blockchain by 2020. The company mentioned it had DLT-related pilots operating in six countries.</p>
      <p>Around the same time, China’s popular online retailer JD.com <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/04/24/jd-com-chicken-blockchain-sales/">announced</a> that sales of its free-range chickens had doubled in two years, and attributed blockchain-enabled QR-codes to at least some of that success.</p>
      <p>Other major supermarkets have been ‘blockchainifying’ their products, too. Auchan <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/11/27/auchan-blockchain-tracking/">sells carrots</a> that are on the blockchain, while Dutch supermarket Albert Heijn has used the technology to <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/09/21/albert-heijn-juicy-blockchain/">render the supply routes</a> of its orange juice totally transparent.</p>
