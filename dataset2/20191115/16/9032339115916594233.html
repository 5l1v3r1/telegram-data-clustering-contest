      <p><a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a29677852/kate-middleton-secret-moms-night-out-report/">Kate Middleton</a> is everything you imagine a real-life royal to be. She's poised (and <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a29785819/kate-middleton-falls-prince-william/">when she's not</a>, she has a great sense of humor about it), <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/trends/g1811/kate-middleton-outfits/">stylish</a>, <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a28832703/kate-middleton-prince-william-rename-royal-foundation/">charitable</a>, and she <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a25396397/kate-middleton-tiara-diplomatic-reception-2018/">looks amazing in a tiara</a>. But that doesn't mean she's above taking public transit.</p>
      <p>This morning, the Duchess of Cambridge traveled to Norfolk for the launch of <a href="https://www.each.org.uk/the-nook">The Nook children's hospice</a>. While she ultimately arrived at the engagement itself by car (in a stunning berry pink skirt suit by Oscar de la Renta that she's <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a29810155/kate-middleton-oscar-de-la-renta-suit/">worn at least twice before</a>), Kate traveled to Norfolk the same way most Londoners would: by train.</p>
      <p>Specifically, she was spotted disembarking a Wherry Lines train, according to footage shared by bystanders. The line, according to the <a href="https://twitter.com/WherryLines">Wherry Lines Twitter account</a>, is supported by the <a href="https://communityrail.org.uk/">Community Rail Partnership</a> and runs from Norwich to Great Yarmouth and Norwich to Lowestoft.</p>
      <p>If you've ever wondered what <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a25910893/kate-middleton-oscar-de-la-renta-suit-royal-opera-house/">pristine Oscar de la Renta</a> looks like in a crowd of morning train commuters, here's your answer:</p>

      <p>Today's engagement is one Kate has been working toward for half a decade. Five years ago, the duchess helped launch a public appeal to fund the center, which supports children with life-threatening illnesses. She's also a royal patron of <a href="https://www.each.org.uk/">East Anglia’s Children’s Hospices</a>, the group behind the new $13 million facility.</p>
