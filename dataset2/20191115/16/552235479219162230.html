      <p>Temperatures have started to drop and we’re already seeing gritters out on the roads as the dark cloak of winter settles around Scotland’s broad shoulders.</p>
      <p>Too dramatic?</p>
      <p>Well, we can’t be the only ones sitting in an open-plan office with layers on wishing somebody would crank up the heating. </p>
      <p>Using a keyboard and mouse with cold fingers is not to be sneered at and no amount of hot cups of tea ever seem to make it any better.</p>
      <p>Until now.</p>
      <p>Amazon is selling a heated mouse mat.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://amzn.to/2Om7eOe">USB Heated Mouse Pad Mouse Hand Warmer with Wristguard</a> comes in a variety of colours to match your office decor, ranging from winter white to vibrant magenta, reports the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/shopping-deals/amazons-heated-mouse-mat-keep-20858054?_ga=2.178810852.1367365681.1573717259-990669471.1561716015">Mirror Online</a> .</p>

      <p>Shoppers who have already bought one of these winter-warmers have nothing but praise for the product.</p>
      <p>One satisfied customer said: "I have a mild form of Raynaud's and no matter what I do, once I get working at my computer my mouse hand turns to ice in minutes. But no more - this thing works."</p>
      <p>And a second reviewer added: "People at work call it my big pink slipper. I call it my haven for warm fingers!</p>
      <p>"This is great. I should have bought one of these years ago.</p>
      <p>“Keeps my fingers nice and toasty in my cold office building. The good thing is if it gets too warm I can turn it off."</p>

      <p>If you're looking for something a bit more fun without losing the functionality, Amazon also has several animal paw-shaped heated mouse mats.</p>
      <p>They're half the price, but don't have any reviews yet, so we're not sure how good they are.</p>
      <p>This Plush USB Heated Mouse Mat costs £8.27 and comes in three colours - <a href="https://amzn.to/2QobSh2">view it on Amazon here</a> .</p>
