      <h2>Justice Secretary fell in London when surrounded by protesters.</h2>

      <p>Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters defied a warning by China’s President Xi Jinping and again took to the city’s streets on Friday, as the political turmoil seeped out to London where a Minister from the Southern Chinese city was confronted by masked demonstrators.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong has seen relentless protests since June as many in the city of 7.5 million people have vented fury at eroding freedoms under Chinese rule.</p>
      <p>Violence has escalated, and tensions have spilt out overseas, sparking friction between China and Britain, which governed Hong Kong until 1997.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>On Thursday night, Hong Kong Justice Secretary Teresa Cheng fell in London after being surrounded by pro-democracy protesters, in the most physical confrontation involving a member of cabinet since the unrest began.</p>
      <h3>‘Appalling attack’</h3>
      <p>Ms. Cheng walked away without any visible signs of injury.</p>
      <p>But China called it an “appalling attack” and accused Britain of fuelling the protest movement.</p>
      <p>Former colonial power Britain has urged Beijing and Hong Kong to seek a political solution to the city’s crisis and has condemned the escalating violence on both sides.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>In a briefing in Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said if the U.K. “continues to add fuel to the fire... then it will bring calamity on itself.”</p>
      <p>Earlier on Friday, thousands of mainly office workers took to the Chinese territory’s streets, many chanting “Stand with Hong Kong” and raising an open hand with five fingers splayed.</p>
      <p>It is a reference to the five demands of the protest movement, which include the right to freely elect Hong Kong’s leaders, as well as an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality.</p>
      <p>“Every person in Hong Kong has a role to play,” James, a 33-year-old banking employee told AFP, adding “sacrifice” was necessary to keep the wind behind the protest movement.</p>
      <p>Black-clad protesters also occupied university campuses, while the city endured another day of transport chaos with suspensions on the vandalised train network and roads blocked by barricades.</p>
      <p>Their actions were in defiance of a warning by Chinese President Xi who on Thursday backed Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam and the police force.</p>
      <p>Xi said “stopping violence and controlling chaos” was the top priority.</p>
      <p>With the crisis deepening by the week, fears have grown that Xi’s patience will run out and Chinese troops will be deployed into to Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>The Global Times, one of the powerful arms of the Chinese state media, on Thursday fuelled tensions with a tweet reporting that a curfew was imminent.</p>
      <p>But it quickly withdrew the tweet and the Hong Kong’s government denied a curfew was planned.</p>
