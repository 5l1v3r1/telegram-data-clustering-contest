      <h2>Students visit stores on 100 feet road in Indiranagar</h2>

      <p>Children and youth from Indiranagar spent Friday evening appealing to the managements of commercial establishments on 100 feet road against putting lights on trees outside their outlets.</p>
      <p>Students claimed that the use of this decorative lighting severely impacts the health of trees. “The unnatural light affects natural processes like flowering. The nails used to wrap the lights around the protective bark of a tree allows for the growth of fungus and bacteria over time as they rust,” they said.</p>
      <p>The effort was spearheaded by members of Interact Club, a youth community service organisation.</p>
      <p>The movement started a few weeks ago with an online appeal sent to the stores via social media. Several stores, including Reliance Footprint and Croma, obliged and removed all the lights from trees near their premises.</p>
      <p>The students visited the stores that did not respond to the plea.</p>
      <p>“We, the younger generation, are growing up to be more environmentally conscious individuals. We have the power to make a lasting social impact if we start acting now. To preserve the rich status of Bengaluru as a green city, we must safeguard our environment starting first with our neighbourhood,” said Anika Gururaj, president, Interact Club, Indiranagar.</p>
