      <p>The Bhagavata Purana captures all the nuances of Prahlada’s exemplary devotion through the words of Narada, who is himself a great devotee and is also the child’s preceptor. An equally moving account of this story has been sung by the poet Kamban in the Ramayana through the words of Vibhishana when he tries to offer Hitopadesa to Ravana on the eve of war, pointed out Kalyanapuram Sri Aravamudhachariar in a discourse.</p>
      <p>It is held that when Prahlada is in his mother’s womb, he gets the chance to listen to the spiritual discourses that Narada gives to his mother. So devotion to the Lord becomes deep-seated in his nature and it only gets strengthened as he grows up in an atmosphere that is strongly antagonistic to his belief since the inborn tendency in his father Hiranyakasipu is enmity to Vishnu. Naturally tensions arise when all the autocratic methods of indoctrination spearheaded by Hiranyakasipu to bring a change in his son fall flat.</p>
      <p>The child would fearlessly utter the Narayana Nama that the Vedas hail as the only force that can protect him, his father and the entire world as well. Seen from the asura perspective, the Bhagavata says that ‘Prahlada is a sinner who utters Narayana Nama and is a thorny tree in the sandal wood forest of the asura race.’ But Prahlada is unfazed and would explain the greatness of Hari to the asura children. He is grateful to Sage Narada for instilling devotion in him. His words of advice would point to the fleeting nature of human existence and hence the need to make the best use of human birth to seek salvation. The Lord is the eternal ruler over the entire creation from Brahma to the lowest and immobile aspects in the world. Bhakti alone is sure to relieve people from samsara.</p>
