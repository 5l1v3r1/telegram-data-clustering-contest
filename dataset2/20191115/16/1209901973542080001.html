      <p>Residents of the Village of Gadsby have overwhelmingly voted in favour of becoming a hamlet in the County of Stettler on Nov. 13th, 14th.</p>
      <p>The Village of Gadsby, located 20 minutes east of Stettler, is known for being the smallest village in Alberta with an approximate population of just 40 people.</p>
      <p>Twenty-seven residents voted in favour of becoming a hamlet, while one person voted to remain a village.</p>
      <p>Municipal Affairs chose to oversee the vote following the Village of Gadsby Viability Review Report, which was expedited following the resignations of the village’s CAO and three-member council in early May.</p>
      <p>The report provided an analysis on the state of the village, details of an infrastructure audit, as well as a description of what could be expected if the village dissolves.</p>
      <p>County of Stettler Director of Communications Niki Thorsteinsson says the Minister of Municipal Affairs will recommend the “dissolution of the Village of Gadsby” to the Provincial Cabinet.</p>
      <p>“It will ultimately be Cabinet’s decision whether or not they dissolve the Village of Gadsby,” she said.</p>
      <p>“At this time we are not aware of the timeline associated with these next steps,” Thorsteinsson said, adding that there is more information to come.</p>
