      <h1>Files by Google can now play local files on a nearby Chromecast</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T16:30:04+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 16:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/nexusben1/" target="_blank">Ben Schoon</a></address>
      <p>In the age of streaming services and cloud backups, it’s not all that often we have to play local files off of a device. However, Google is making that a lot easier with the latest update to its file manager app. Files by Google can now play your locally stored media on a Chromecast display.</p>
      <p>Files by Google version 1.0.27 is <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.nbu.files">available now on the Google Play Store</a> and it finally delivers the long-awaited support for Chromecast to all users. Previously the feature was <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/09/18/files-by-google-beta-chromecast/">available for beta users</a>.</p>
      <p>The feature works with all types of media that you’d want to display on a Chromecast including videos, photos, and audio too. Notably, the only way to get the Chromecast icon to show up is to go into a section of the app that contains media. It won’t appear on the app’s main screen for instance.</p>
      <p>Once content is playing you’ll get a full-screen interface showing what media is playing. In this interface – at least if you’re displaying pictures – a swipe from the left or right will change the image on-screen. In our brief testing of the feature, it seems to work pretty well although sometimes it rotates images or takes a moment to load. Notably, it even works on smart displays and Android TV devices too.</p>
      <p>You should be able to use this functionality as soon as you update the app, but closing it and re-opening seems to trigger the feature if it doesn’t immediately appear.</p>
