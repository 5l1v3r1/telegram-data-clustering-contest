      <h2>Best bets for the weekend's Euro 2020 qualifiers with England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all in action</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T16:18:54+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 16:18</time> by <a rel="author">Dave Prentice</a></address>
      <p>So ten Euro 2020 qualifying spots have already been claimed, with 14 still to go after England, Czech Republic, France and Turkey all booked their places for next summer's jamboree on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Wales and Northern Ireland are still in contention, but Scotland are relying on next year's play-offs.</p>
      <p>The Republic of Ireland top their group, but could yet finish third.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Portugal, Germany and Holland still have work to do to seal their places at Euro 2020, with the top two going through from each group.</p>
      <p>So who is going to join Ukraine, Spain, Poland, Belgium, Russia, Italy and Thursday's qualifiers at next year's continent-wide finals?</p>
      <p>We take a look at this weekend's fixtures.</p>
      <h3>Cyprus v Scotland (Saturday, 2pm)</h3>
      <p>Scotland are <b><a href="https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/SOCCER/EU_EQ/4109400/?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationworkwide&amp;utm_campaign=football_odds_editorial">6/4 favourites</a> </b>to win in Nicosia. Really. <br/><br/>No, we can't work out why either. <br/><br/>Cyprus have beaten Slovenia, held Bulgaria and put five past San Marino on home soil in the past 12 months. <br/><br/>While Scotland's travel sickness in this group has been acute. <br/><br/>They have lost three of their four away matches to nil, failing to score even in Kazakhstan, and needed a last minute Ollie Burke goal to scrape past the Cypriots at Hampden Park in June. <br/><br/>There is no doubt that Cyprus, at <b><a href="https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/SOCCER/EU_EQ/4109400/?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationworkwide&amp;utm_campaign=football_odds_editorial">2/1</a> </b>, are the value bet with thepools.com. <br/><br/>They have won two of their last three, including doing what Scotland couldn't and winning 2-1 in Kazakhstan. <br/><br/>But while the home win isn't exactly nailed on, and we wouldn't warn you off backing the draw at <b><a href="https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/SOCCER/EU_EQ/4109400/?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationworkwide&amp;utm_campaign=football_odds_editorial">11/5</a> </b>, over 2.5 goals at <b><a href="https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/SOCCER/EU_EQ/4109400/?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationworkwide&amp;utm_campaign=football_odds_editorial">5/4</a> </b>looks a sure thing.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>That has happened in seven of Scotland's eight qualifying matches so far and three of Cyprus' last four. <br/><br/>One of those goals to come quickly is also worth considering. <br/><br/>Thepools.com offer <b><a href="https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/SOCCER/EU_EQ/4109400/?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationworkwide&amp;utm_campaign=football_odds_editorial">12/5</a> </b>on there being a goal inside the opening 15 minutes. <br/><br/>In all four home games in this competition so far Cyprus have either scored or conceded in the opening twenty minutes.</p>
      <h3>Azerbaijan v Wales (Saturday, 5pm)</h3>
      <p>This is not quite must-win for Wales.</p>
      <p>But it's certainly must not lose.</p>
      <p>A draw in Baku sets up a winner takes all <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/cardiff-city-fc">Cardiff</a> showdown with Hungary - but Wales won't go looking for a point. <br/><br/>And with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> midfielder Aaron Ramsey fit for the first time in the current qualifying campaign, and Gareth Bale training with the squad despite not featuring recently for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> because of injury, they have the quality to win. <br/><br/>Odds of <b><a href="https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/SOCCER/EU_EQ/4109401/?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationworkwide&amp;utm_campaign=football_odds_editorial">1/2</a> </b>are short, though. <br/><br/>A better bet - a much better bet - is Wales to win and both teams to score, <b><a href="https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/SOCCER/EU_EQ/4109401/?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationworkwide&amp;utm_campaign=football_odds_editorial">a whopping 3/1</a> </b>. <br/><br/>Azerbaijan have netted in all of their qualifying home matches to date. <br/><br/>If you don't have that much faith in Wales, <b><a href="https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/SOCCER/EU_EQ/4109401/?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationworkwide&amp;utm_campaign=football_odds_editorial">7/5 for both teams to score</a> </b>is also solid.</p>

      <p>And Harry Wilson at <b><a href="https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/SOCCER/EU_EQ/4109401/?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationworkwide&amp;utm_campaign=football_odds_editorial">11/2</a> </b>to open the scoring is worth considering, too.</p>
      <h3>Northern Ireland v Holland (Saturday, 7.45pm)</h3>
      <p>The Dutch cruelly broke Northern Irish hearts in Rotterdam in September, with added time goals.</p>
      <p>But that merely underlined why Ronald Koeman's men will not take Michael O'Neill's side for granted at Windsor Park.</p>
      <p>They will hope to break the home side down a little quicker than they did on home soil, but the <b><a href="https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/SOCCER/EU_EQ/4109411/?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationworkwide&amp;utm_campaign=football_odds_editorial">draw half-time Holland full-time tip at 3/1</a> </b>has to be worth considering.</p>
      <p>So, too, does Memphis Depay <b><a href="https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/SOCCER/EU_EQ/4109411/?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationworkwide&amp;utm_campaign=football_odds_editorial">first scorer at 16/5</a> </b>.</p>
      <p>The Lyon striker has fired seven goals in his last five matches and that's money-making form.</p>
      <h3>Kosovo v England (Sunday, 5pm)</h3>
      <p>We tipped an England win and over 3.5 goals on Thursday - but never expected it to come in after 25 minutes! <br/><br/>After the eight-goal thriller between the two sides at St Mary's we can safely assume there will be goals again. <br/><br/>Predicting how many is the trick, though. <br/><br/>Since that 5-3 humdinger Kosovo have pipped Gibraltar 1-0, Montenegro 2-0 and lost 2-1 in the Czech Republic on Thursday.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>England, of course, usually guarantee goals - and even in Thursday's 7-0 mauling of Montenegro they still needed Jordan Pickford to pull a couple of fine stops out. <br/><br/>Both Teams To Score and England to win is the way to go at <b><a href="https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/SOCCER/EU_EQ/4200420/?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationworkwide&amp;utm_campaign=football_odds_editorial">21/10</a> </b>.</p>
