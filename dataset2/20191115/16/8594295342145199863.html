      <p>At a private event in Rome this week, Ferrari introduced its newest model — the Roma. Described by Ferrari Commercial Director Enrico Galliera as an automobile for “people who would like to drive a sports car, or a Ferrari, but are a little bit afraid of Ferrari and sportscars,” it boasts one of the worst marketing taglines imaginable.</p>
      <p>It also has a key fob that’s embarrassing to carry around — assuming shame is an emotion still within your repertoire.</p>
      <p>While high-performance exotics aren’t widely known for being tasteful, Ferrari has always had a thin veneer of respectability brands like Lamborghini lacked. Owning one gave off the impression that you might have a mild appreciation for brand heritage or some interest in motorsport. At the very least, the prevailing prejudices would presume you were a probably a car snob with strong opinions and nuanced tastes.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, the Roma (Rome) and its gaudy key are helping to dissipate that formerly effective illusion. </p>

      <p>We assume Galliera was attempting to highlight the Roma’s role as a grand touring car. The actual slogan for the model is “<i>la Nuova Dolce Vita</i>” (the new sweet life). But Galliera’s line seems far more informative on how the brand sees its future customers.</p>
      <p>The Roma is exceptionally handsome, sleek and clean looking. In all honesty, it’s probably one of the most attractive Aston Martins this author has seen in years. Sadly, it’s supposed to be a new model from Ferrari. Maybe that explains why the company decided to give it a key that’s literally a hood ornament. “No, I swear it’s a Ferrari,” you’ll plead to strangers who have no interest in interacting with you. “I have this giant rectangle in my pocket to prove it!”</p>
      <p>Evidence of the key was provided by <i>Top Gear’s</i> Jack Rix, who was in attendance of Roma’s reveal. “New Ferrari key… way more visible when you drop it in the bowl on the way in,” <a href="https://twitter.com/jack_rix/status/1194954968807198722">he joked while sharing photos</a>.</p>

      <p>Ferrari’s previous key was similarly unsubtle, boasting branded lettering and red paint. But it still managed to offer a smidgen more good taste than this new one does. Here’s our guess as to why:</p>
      <p>The Ferrari brand lives and dies by its name. It doesn’t engage in a lot of advertising — relying on race events, media feedback, and its own merchandise (where it makes a lot of money) to do the work instead. And it’s hoping to expand its branding/merch efforts via new products and a partnership with Giorgio Armani on high-end wares. More merchandise means more eyes on the company and more prospective customers. Because someone who already owns a Ferrari probably won’t bother spending $400 on a branded red watch or puffy jacket — but someone who bought those items and <i>doesn’t</i> own a Ferrari probably wants one rather badly.</p>
      <p>Step two involves the Roma itself. Based on <a href="https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2017/08/ferrari-unveils-new-entry-level-replacement-of-the-california/">the Portofino</a>, it’s likely to be a more affordable way to get into the brand. New customers will assuredly want to let the the world know what they’re driving and the shameless key does a lot of the plug work for them.</p>

      <p>If you’re interested in the Roma, it comes with a turbocharged 3.8-liter V8 making 612 horsepower (a bit more than Portofino) at 7,500 rpm and 561 lb-ft of peak torque. Banging through the model’s eight-speed, dual-clutch automatic will have 62 mph coming on in 3.4 seconds, according to the manufacturer. 124 mph is said to be available in 9.3 seconds, with the top end settling in at 199 mph. Dry weight is a claimed 3,245 pounds.</p>
      <p>Electronic trickery abounds, with Ferrari Roma offering torque vectoring (via individual brakes), an adaptive spoiler, slide-slip control (version 6.0), and more. It also has a modern-looking interior that isolates driver from passenger in their own little pods. It’s a slight departure to be sure, but perhaps one that plays into its customer base — just like that hideous key.</p>
      <p>Sales are expected to commence next summer with a price tag slightly higher than the Portofino’s $215,000 MSRP.</p>
