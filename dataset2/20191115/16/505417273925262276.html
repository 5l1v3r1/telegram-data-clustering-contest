      <h1>The Team Ireland Should Start In Crucial Qualifier Against Denmark</h1>

        <b>On Monday, Ireland take on Denmark in their final Euro 2020 qualifier knowing victory is required over their familiar foes in order to reach next summer’s finals.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Boys in Green impressed in their friendly win over New Zealand last night but it’s likely that the Irish boss will ring the changes for Monday’s all important clash.</p>
      <p>But what starting XI should Mick McCarthy select in order to get the three points required to send Ireland through to Euro 2020?</p>
      <p>Let’s take a look.</p>

      <p>
        <b>5-3-2</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Goalkeeper</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mark Travers and Kieran O’Hara have proven to be suitable back-up when called upon in recent friendlies but a fit again <b>Darren Randolph</b> is guaranteed to start between the sticks against Denmark.</p>
      <p>_____</p>
      <p>
        <b>Defence</b>
      </p>
      <p>We’ve gone with five at the back, as its the formation that all of the defenders in question are used to, having played there week in and week out at club level.</p>
      <p>At left-wing-back, <b>Enda Stevens</b> will have the freedom of the flank as he does at Sheffield United and will be able to link with his Blades teammates David McGoldrick and Callum Robinson up top who we’ll discuss later.</p>
      <p>On the other flank, <b>Matt Doherty</b> may finally kick on at international level playing in this system while <b>Shane Duffy</b> and <b>John Egan</b> pick themselves in the middle with the former operating in the centre and the latter on the right of the three.</p>
      <p>The final centre-half spot is a toss up between Kevin Long and <b>Ciaran Clark</b>, both of whom looked strong against New Zealand but given the Newcastle man’s club form and familiarity with the system of five at the back, we’ve gone with Clark.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Midfield</b>
      </p>
      <p>This is a tricky one.</p>
      <p>Glenn Whelan hasn’t necessarily done anything wrong – in fact he’s arguably been Ireland’s best midfielder throughout the campaign – but it’s time to finally pull the trigger on <b>Josh Cullen.</b></p>
      <p>Once again the Charlton man impressed in a friendly dictating the play throughout the game acting as the metronome in the Irish midfield.</p>
      <p>Cullen would be a risk over the safer Whelan, but in a one-off game it could be a risk worth taking.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Alongside Cullen, <b>Conor Hourihane</b> is selected and although he didn’t cover himself in glory in his cameo against New Zealand, the Villa man has proven he can be a positive asset in the midfield and his quality from set-pieces could be vital in what’s set to be a tight game on Monday night.</p>
      <p>Again the final spot is a contested one, with both Jeff Hendrick and <b>Alan Browne</b> in similar situations of showing promise at times but failing to deliver consistently.</p>
      <p>We’ve gone with Browne, in the hopes that he can rediscover his creative touch from his club form last season playing just behind the two strikers.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Strikers</b>
      </p>
      <p>McCarthy will be relieved to have <b>David McGoldrick</b> back fit once again and given Ireland’s struggles going forward in the previous two qualifiers, the Sheffield United man proved just how key he is to the way this side operate.</p>
      <p>In the 5-3-2 formation he will also be able to find space in the channels as he does for The Blades and create space for Browne and possibly Hourihane to run in behind.</p>
      <p>Alongside McGoldrick it was a tight call between Sean Maguire<a href="https://punditarena.com/football/oisinmcqueirns2758/sean-maguire-first-ireland-goal/">, who was brilliant as he grabbed his first international goal against New Zealand</a>, or <b>Callum Robinson</b> who also found the net last night and looked as though he had a real point to prove as he came off the bench.</p>

      <p>We’ve gone with Robinson once again due to his familiarity with both McGoldrick and the system and the 25-year-old’s pace could be a real threat for Ireland in a game that they’ll have to take their chances in.</p>
