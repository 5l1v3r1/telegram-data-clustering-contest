      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sbi-chairman">SBI Chairman </a>Rajnish Kumar on Friday said the Supreme Court's judgement in the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/essar-steel">Essar Steel </a>case with regard to rights of various creditors during insolvency proceedings would significantly reduce the scope for long-drawn litigations and eventually lead to faster resolution of stressed assets.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court on Friday set aside an NCLAT order which gave equal rights to the secured and unsecured creditors during the insolvency proceedings of debt-ridden Essar Steel, clearing the decks for its takeover by Lakshmi Mittal-led ArcelorMittal.</p>
      <p>Setting aside the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) order, a three-judge bench headed by Justice R F Nariman said the two sets of creditors will be treated differently during the insolvency proceedings and taking over of a debt-ridden firm by another company.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court has upheld that the ultimate discretion on distribution of funds is with the Committee of Creditors, Kumar said.</p>
      <p>SBI, the country's largest bank, has an exposure of around Rs 14,000 crore in <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/essar-steel">Essar Steel.</a></p>
      <p>"This much awaited judgement also settles to rest numerous points of law under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code which were tested in various courts.</p>
      <p>"This should significantly reduce the scope for long drawn-litigations under IBC and would eventually lead to faster resolutions of stressed assets," the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sbi-chairman">SBI Chairman </a>said.</p>
      <p>SBI's shared closed at Rs 322 on BSE, up 5.19 per cent.</p>
