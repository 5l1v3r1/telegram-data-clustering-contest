      <h3>I found the article “<a href="https://nationalpost.com/news/world/u-k-researchers-taught-rats-to-drive-tiny-cars-by-rewarding-them-with-food">Rewarded with sugar, rats taught to drive</a>” (NP, Oct. 28) very interesting. It stated that rats held in a more stimulating environment with ‘various interesting objects’ keeping them active, actually had a greater ability to learn to drive a small vehicle around a rectangular track to a sugary cereal treat at the destination, then those kept in a cage. It did not mention anything about physical health after the sugary cereal treats.</h3>
      <p>I see a correlation to today’s children and young people. If the only stimulation is from a screen and using their thumbs and the bulk of the rewards are sugary or fast foods … well then they have basically chosen their cage and a lower ability to learn and poorer health will surely follow.</p>
