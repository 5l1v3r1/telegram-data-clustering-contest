      <h1>Free Update Adds Real-Time Animal Eye AF to the Sony RX10 IV</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.adorama.com/isorx10m4.html?kbid=67085">The Sony RX10 IV</a> is one of (if not <i>the</i>) most popular bridge/superzoom cameras on the market, and it just got better. As promised in <a href="https://petapixel.com/2019/10/28/real-time-animal-eye-af-is-coming-to-sonys-rx10-iv-via-firmware-update/">an earlier announcement</a>, Sony has released a free firmware update that improves the RX10’s autofocus by adding Real-Time Animal Eye AF.</p>
      <p>Real-Time Animal Eye AF <a href="https://petapixel.com/2019/09/24/sony-a9-firmware-6-0-adds-animal-eye-af-interval-timer-and-more/">first debuted</a> in Sony’s E-Mount ILCs, but the feature—which will no-doubt be extremely appealing to amateur shutterbugs—is making its way into the RX series with <a href="https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/compact-cameras-dsc-rx-series/dsc-rx10m4/downloads">Firmware Version 2.0 for the RX10 IV</a>.</p>
      <p>The update is available to download now, and according to the release notes it:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Adds Real-Time Eye AF for animals</li>
        <li>Enables the possibility to operate the Real-Time Eye AF by half-pressing the shutter button</li>
        <li>Improves the overall stability of the camera</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The release notes also list two caveats: You can’t detect human and animal eyes simultaneously, and Animal Eye AF may not work in every situation depending on the “environment, animal type or the movement of the animal.”</p>
      <p>Here’s a quick demo of the feature in action on Sony’s more expensive a7 series cameras:</p>
