      <p>French producer <b>James BKS</b> has put together a very impressive crew for this lively, groovy new song, and he says, “<b>Little Simz, Idris Elba, Q-Tip</b>, and me strongly and proudly represent the New Breed movement, a different way to approach music with no borders, no judgment, no labels. We have learned from our past mistakes and victories and our eyes are on Africa, while in the meantime we embrace our own personal paths, respectively in the UK for Little Simz and Idris Elba, in the U.S. for Q-Tip and in France for me.”</p>
