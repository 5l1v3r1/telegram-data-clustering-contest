      <p><b>Versace Collaborates With Artist Sarah Baker for the Holidays</b><br/>Rather than releasing a traditional campaign, Donatella Versace is guest editing the second edition of <i>Baroness,</i> a London-based publication co-founded by Matthew Holroyd and <i>Dazed &amp; Confused</i> editor-in-chief Isabella Burley. Performance artist Sarah Baker has created a six chapter narrative starring herself and Helena Christensen, featuring Versace ready-to-wear, jewelry, and home decor pieces. “I am thrilled to partner with Sarah Baker on this exciting holiday saga,” says Donatella Versace. “She’s a visionary and knows exactly how to represent the Versace woman. My designs empower and this campaign fully represents that.”</p>

      <p><b>A New Prada Exhibit Is In the Works (<a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/arts/design-museum-prada-exhibition-fashion-a4285836.html">Evening Standard</a>)</b><br/><i>Prada. Front and Back</i>, a new exhibit charting Miuccia Prada’s work at the house, will debut at the Design Museum in London next September. “For me, it’s a particularly personal challenge to work on the Prada exhibition,” says Deyan Sudjic, the museum’s co-director. “There is so much to explore about a company that never wants to do the obvious thing, and that is such a genuine cultural force.”</p>
