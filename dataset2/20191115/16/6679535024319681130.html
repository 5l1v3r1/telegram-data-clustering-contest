      <p>The runaway growth and development of Chamundi Hills sponsored by the government came under flak at a public meeting here on Friday as residents questioned the need for new infrastructure. The meeting was conducted by the Institution of Engineers and the immediate trigger point was the loud thinking by authorities for additional projects including a ropeway. It was also resolved to seek a buffer zone around Chamundi Hill to protect it.</p>
      <p>Speakers were unanimous in calling for a halt to such works and the government came under flak for ignoring the people while taking up such ecologically damaging projects. The works were described as ‘vandalism of the cultural and natural heritage of Mysuru’.</p>
      <p>It was only recently that district in-charge V. Somanna mooted the idea of a new commercial complex, a ropeway, police outpost and other facilities for pilgrims to stay atop Chamundi Hill, none of which were necessary as the commuting distance from Mysuru to the temple atop was hardly 15 minutes.</p>
      <p>Maj. Gen. (retd) Sudhir Vombatkere said many projects like ropeway had already been rejected but came up every now and then. The ropeway can handle a few hundreds per day which is insignificant given the footfall to the hill, he said, adding that it would also be economically unviable and environmentally disastrous.</p>
      <p>He said commercialization and concretisation of Chamundi Hill was a fallout of the government violating its own law though the Constitution mandates conservation. He said the proposed conversion of two-lane road to four lanes, was also questionable. Two road lead to Chamundi Hill and one could be used to go up and the other to descend and thus avoid traffic, he said, while cautioning that such projects had social, economic, environmental and heritage cost. The people of Mysuru should take it upon themselves to save Chamundi Hills from such vandalism.</p>
      <p>Ashwini Ranjan of the Mysore Grahakara Parishat, questioned the need for such projects when alternatives existed and pointed out that no environmental impact assessment was done for any. The government and officials supporting such projects were hurting the sentiments of the people, he added.</p>
      <p>Environmentalist U.N. Ravikumar warned that Mysuru was set to lose its important watershed as Chamundi Hill helped recharge nearly 20 lakes. It was a reserve forest within a city and hence not only acted as a lung space but helped regulate its microclimatic conditions. He pointed out the growth in tourism had led to an increase in human and vehicle traffic beyond the carrying capacity of Chamundi Hill.</p>
      <p>N.S. Rangaraju, former professor, Ancient History and Archaeology, UoM, said Chamundi Hill was an example of living cultural heritage. He pointed out that as many as 29 ancient inscriptions were discovered that underlined its historical importance as well.</p>
      <p>M. Lakshman, convening the meeting said the proceedings and the public demand would be forwarded to the government to take measures to save Chamundi Hill.</p>
