      <p>Toronto police have made an arrest in the vandalism of a monument to the city's war dead.</p>
      <p>Police say a 33-year-old Toronto man faces two mischief-related charges and was due in court Friday morning.</p>
      <p>He's accused of spray-painting the words "Ye broke faith with us" on the cenotaph at Old City Hall, an apparent reference to the famous war poem In Flanders Fields.</p>
      <p>The graffiti was discovered Tuesday morning, less than 24 hours after hundreds attended a Remembrance Day ceremony at the monument.</p>
      <p>A police spokesman said at the time that it was disrespectful to both veterans and current members of the Canadian Armed Forces.</p>
      <p>Ontario Premier Doug Ford tweeted that it was "disgusting" to see the monument vandalized.</p>
      <p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 15, 2019.</p>
