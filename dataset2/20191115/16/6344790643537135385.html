      <h1>New Trailer For M. Night Shyamalan's Thriller Series SERVANT Shows The Creation of Jericho</h1>

      <p>Apple TV+ has shared a new trailer for<b> M. Night Shyamalan</b>’s unsettling upcoming psychological thriller series called<b><i> Servant</i></b>. This trailer focuses on the creation of the Reborn Doll, which is named Jericho.</p>
      <p>The story follows a Philadelphia couple, played by <b>Lauren Ambrose </b>and <b>Toby Kebbell</b>, in mourning after an unspeakable tragedy creates a rift in their marriage and opens the door for a mysterious force, in the form of a nanny, to enter their home. The unspeakable tragedy is the death of their 13-week-old baby, and to help them cope with what happened, they are given a Reborn Doll, which is meant to help grieving parents cope with a sudden loss like this.</p>
      <p>From what I’ve seen, this series has a very uncomfortable vibe and puts you in the middle of an awkward and distressing story. That story is sure to be filled with some interesting twists and turns, especially with Shyamalan’s involvement. I’m really curious to see how this story plays out and comes to an end. Shyamalan previously talked about the tone of the series, saying:</p>
      <blockquote>“The premise of this piece is that a couple lost a child and they’re doing fringe therapy with a doll. It’s a real therapy. [But] it gets so extreme that the mother decides to hire a nanny to take care of the doll. It’s sad but also super funny… That’s the kind of tone I’m interested in, like with <i>Split </i>and<i> The Visit</i>, where you’re so scared you’re laughing.”</blockquote>
      <p>The series was created and written by <b>Tony Basgallop</b>, and it has a great cast that also includes <b>Nell Tiger Free</b> and<b> Rupert Grint</b>.</p>
      <p><i>Servant</i> premieres on November 28th exclusively on Apple TV+. Will you be watching?</p>
