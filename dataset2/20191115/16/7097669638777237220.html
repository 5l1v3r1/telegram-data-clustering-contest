      <h1>Yovanovitch: Don Jr. and Fox News Hosts ‘Amplified’ Smears Against Me</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T16:16:31+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 16:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/" target="_blank">Justin Baragona</a></address>
      <p>During Friday’s public impeachment hearing, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch described how conservatives and right-wing media figures repeatedly disparaged her last spring in an apparent effort by Trumpworld to sully her reputation in order to justify removing her from her post.</p>
      <p>House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) asked Yovanovich about former top Ukraine prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko, pointing out that she likely angered Lutsenko in her time as ambassador due to her anti-corruption efforts.</p>
      <p>Noting that another former Ukrainian prosecutor general, Viktor Sholkin, also had a history of corruption, Schiff asked Yovanovitch: “Did you come to learn that both were in touch with Rudy Giuliani, President Trump’s lawyer and representative?”</p>
      <p>“Yes,” the former diplomat replied, adding that it was her understanding that Lutsenko and others coordinated with Giuliani to peddle false allegations against her.</p>
      <p>“And were these smears amplified by the president’s son Donald Trump Jr. as well as certain hosts on Fox?” Schiff wondered aloud.</p>
      <p>“Yes,” she answered. “Yes, that is the case.”</p>
      <p>A few moments later, Democratic majority counsel Daniel Goldman highlighted the coordinated media attacks unleashed by Giuliani and <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/vindman-burns-trump-booster-john-solomon-in-testimony-all-the-key-elements-of-his-reporting-were-false">conservative columnist John Solomon’s Ukraine articles, </a>noting that Trump Jr. and others sent out multiple tweets targeting her.</p>
      <p>“What was your reaction to seeing this?” Goldman asked.</p>
      <p>“Well, I was worried,” Yovanovitch said, adding, “that these attacks, you know, being repeated by the president himself and his son.”</p>
      <p>She also noted that she was aware that the allegations against her had received attention on Fox News primetime programming, pointing out that the accusation she was “bad-mouthing” Trump in Ukraine was untrue.</p>
      <p>In previous testimony, Yovanovitch had said that she was told that the State Department <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/george-kent-testimony-state-dept-brass-told-hannity-to-stop-smearing-marie-yovanovitch">would contact Fox News host Sean Hannity</a> to get to the bottom of the attacks against her, something <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/hannity-denies-state-department-called-him-about-yovanovitch-its-fake-news">Hannity has loudly denied.</a></p>
