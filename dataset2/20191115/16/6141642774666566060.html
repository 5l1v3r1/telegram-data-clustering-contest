      <p>Germany manager Joachim Low does not expect his side to be among the tournament favourites for Euro 2020 should they clinch qualification.</p>
      <p>Victory over Belarus in Monchengladbach on Saturday will secure Low’s side a place at next summer’s finals provided fellow Group C heavyweights Holland are not beaten by third-placed Northern Ireland, who Germany host in the final round of fixtures on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>As soon as Germany officially enter the hat they will be considered serious contenders but Low, who has seen his side as both an emerging force and a conquering one during his long reign, feels others are better developed at present.</p>
      <p>“I would compare it to 2010, when everything only came together in the build-up to the (World Cup). I don’t see us as favourites for next year because of the number of young players in the team, but I still feel anything is possible for us,” Low said in quotes carried by UEFA.com.</p>
      <p>“Public expectations are always high and we have high aspirations ourselves, but at the moment we cannot dominate a match for 90 minutes. You can only do that when you have been playing together for many years.</p>
      <p>“However, we have a very high level of discipline and you can tell the players are trying to improve ahead of EURO 2020.”</p>
      <p>Speaking at the pre-match press conference he told reporters Germany could not match the cohesion or consistency in selection of other elite nations.</p>
      <p>“France, England, they have been playing with the same players for years,” he said.</p>
      <p>“There’s the Dutch, Spain…to play for this title is incredibly difficult.”</p>
      <p>Low revealed he would once again give a game each to his two leading goalkeepers, with regular number one Manuel Neuer taking the gloves against Belarus and Barcelona’s Marc-Andre Ter Stegen replacing him against Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>The pair appeared to be at loggerheads in September, with Ter Stegen disappointed at his lack of opportunities and Neuer seemingly critical of his understudy.</p>
      <p>The October internationals saw each man given 90 minutes and Low has settled on the same formula again.</p>
      <p>“We have spoken to the goalkeepers. Manuel Neuer will play against Belarus, Ter Stegen against Northern Ireland,” Low added.</p>
      <p>Belarus cannot qualify through the group but can still reach Euro 2020 via the play-offs courtesy of the Nations League.</p>
      <p>Manager Mikhail Markhel approached the chance to face Germany in a positive frame of mind, stating: “You remember games like this for a lifetime, players and coaches, so there is a bit of excitement and we have to deal with that.</p>
      <p>“We try to win every match but we understand how strong our opponents are. What matters to me is not the result but how we play.”</p>
