      <p>Diners can get huge discounts on takeaways and cut food waste by using the Too Good To Go app.</p>
      <p>Too Good To Go partners with food businesses to sell food which they would otherwise throw out. Customers who use <a href="https://toogoodtogo.co.uk/en-gb">the app</a> get discounts on meals from the likes of Yo Sushi, Pizza Punks and Leila Lily's, but they do not get any say in what they order. Instead, they are given a 'magic bag' of food which would otherwise be thrown out. The food is safe to eat, and usually surplus leftover from that day.</p>
      <p><a href="https://toogoodtogo.co.uk/en-gb">Too Good To Go</a> Customers will pay around £3 for a meal. Often, the meals are worth around £10, if they were ordered directly off the restaurant.</p>
