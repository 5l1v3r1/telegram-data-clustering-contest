      <p>Roger Stone has been found guilty on all of the counts against him, including obstruction, five counts of false statements, and witness tampering.</p>
      <p><a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/prime/what-i-am-watching-for-at-the-roger-stone-trial">The trial</a> lasted a little over a week and the jury spent less than two days deliberating.</p>
      <p>Stone was <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/read-roger-stone-indicted-mueller-witness-tampering-false-statements">indicted in January</a> by the Washington, D.C. grand jury that special counsel Robert Mueller empaneled for his investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and related matters.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/prosecutors-outline-key-conversations-in-roger-stone-wikileaks-timeline">put forward emails and texts</a> that they argued show Stone lied to the House Intelligence Committee about having Wikileaks-related communications that he didn’t turn over to Congress.</p>
      <p>They also put on the stand two former top officials from the Trump campaign — <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/rock-gates-stone-testimony">Rick Gates</a> and Steve Bannon — who testified that Stone was perceived in the campaign as having a backchannel to Wikileaks.</p>
      <p>Among the contacts prosecutors highlighted was Stone’s messages with Bannon about Wikileaks’ plans. Lying to the House about Wikileaks-related communications with the Trump campaign was one of the counts Stone was convicted of Friday.</p>
      <p>Randy Credico, whom Stone falsely claimed was his intermediary to Wikileaks in the summer of 2016, was another major witness for prosecutors.</p>
      <p>The jury found Stone guilty of witness tampering for the threatening texts Stone sent Credico demanding that Credico plead the 5th in the House investigation so he would not blow up Stone’s story about who was his intermediary.</p>
      <p>Stone’s sentencing has been scheduled for Feb. 6 at 10 a.m., reporters in the courtroom said. Judge Amy Berman Jackson denied prosecutors’ request to take Stone into custody, but she did not drop a <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/roger-stone-appeals-court-gag-ordered">gag order</a> on Stone.</p>
