      <h2>Two Russians were sentenced in 2017.</h2>

      <p>Two Lithuanians and a Norwegian convicted of espionage in Russia were freed on Friday in exchange for two Russians who had been in prison in Lithuania.</p>
      <p>Yevgeny Mataitis and Aristidas Tamosaitis, who were convicted in 2016, have been reunited with their families, Lithuanian spy chief Darius Jauniskis said.</p>
      <p>Frode Berg, a Norwegian sentenced in Russia to 14 years in prison for espionage, was handed over to Norwayâ€™s embassy in Vilnius after he crossed into Lithuania.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the day, Russians Nikolai Filipchenko and Sergey Moiseyenko were pardoned by Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda.</p>
      <p>The Baltic News Service said the spy swap took place at noon at a border checkpoint with the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. No further details were available.</p>
      <p>We are happy that Frode Berg is now coming home to Norway as a free man, Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg said.</p>
      <p>We would like to thank the Lithuanian authorities for their cooperation and for their efforts to free Mr. Berg, Ms Solberg said.</p>
      <p>Norwegian Foreign Minister Ine Eriksen Soereide said Norway had worked systematically to get Mr. Berg, a retired border inspector, freed since his arrest in Moscow in December 2017 on espionage charges for collecting information about Russian nuclear submarines.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors asserted that he was caught with documents he had received from an employee of a military facility who was shadowed by Russian intelligence.</p>
