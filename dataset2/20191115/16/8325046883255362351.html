      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/google-photos">Google Photos</a> is a great app to store, share, and sync photos across devices.</p>
      <p>It has fun features, like suggested animations, collage and movie makers, and even joint libraries, where you and another person can both add photos from your devices to the same album.</p>
      <p>Sometimes, you may want to save <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/google-photos">Google Photos</a> directly to your <a href="http://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/196318/614286/10014?subId1=bitht_111419_save-google-photos-to-iphone&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-iphone-11-64gb-black-verizon%2F6341340.p%3FskuId%3D6341340">iPhone’s</a> Camera Roll. If you did not originally take the photo, or it isn’t in your phone for some other reason, you’ll have to download it onto your Camera Roll first.</p>
      <p>Note that if you have syncing turned on, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/google-photos">Google Photos</a> knows which photos are already on your Camera Roll, and a save button will not appear next to those.</p>
      <p>Here’s how to save pictures from <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/google-photos">Google Photos</a> to your <a href="http://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/196318/614286/10014?subId1=bitht_111419_save-google-photos-to-iphone&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-iphone-11-64gb-black-verizon%2F6341340.p%3FskuId%3D6341340">iPhone</a>.</p>

      <p><b>1.</b> Open the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-photos/id962194608">Google Photos app</a>.</p>
      <p><b>2.</b> Find the photos you want to save by navigating the tabs at the bottom of the screen. Since these are likely photos you did not take yourself, they might be in the “Sharing” tab at the bottom right of the screen, or the “Albums” tab second from the left.</p>
      <p><b>3.</b> If you only want to save one photo, tap it, then hit the button that says “Save” at the top of the screen. This will save these photos to your Google Photos library.</p>
