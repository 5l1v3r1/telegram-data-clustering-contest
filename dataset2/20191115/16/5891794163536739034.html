      <h1>Putin, Zelenskiy To Meet Next Month To Discuss Ukraine Conflict</h1>

      <p>The French presidency says Paris will host a four-way summit on December 9 seeking to end the conflict in eastern Ukraine, following months of diplomatic efforts to get all sides to agree on new talks.<br/><br/>The meeting will see Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, meeting face-to-face for the first time.<br/><br/>The two leaders will join French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel for the first such four-way talks, known as the Normandy Format, in more than three years.</p>
      <p>Zelenskiy and Macron were coordinating on preparation for the summit, the Ukrainian presidential office said, adding that the French leader would visit Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Macron “emphasized that Ukraine could further count on France's support in all matters," the statement said.</p>
      <p>There was no immediate comment from the Kremlin.<br/><br/>Fighting between Ukrainian armed forces and Russia-backed separatists has killed more than 13,000 people in the eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions since April 2014.<br/><br/>Macron’s office said it was time for a new summit because of “major progress” since the summer, including troop withdrawals from key frontline areas over the past several weeks.<br/><br/>Russia and Ukraine also exchanged a total of 70 prisoners in September.<br/><br/>The meeting "will allow the opening of a new series of steps to put in place the Minsk agreements" that sought to put an end to the fighting in eastern Ukraine, the Elysee Palace said.<br/><br/>Cease-fire road maps announced as part of the Minsk accords, sponsored by France and Germany and signed in the Belarusian capital in September 2014 and February 2015, have contributed to a decrease in fighting in eastern Ukraine but have failed to hold.<br/><br/>Ukraine and the separatists last month signed a tentative agreement on holding elections in the rebel-held areas, a move that prompted substantial criticism among Ukrainians who saw the move as “capitulation” to Russia.<br/><br/>The leaders of Russia, Ukraine, France, and Germany first met in Normandy in 2014 and last met in this format in October 2016, although discussions have continued at a lower level.</p>
