      <h1>Lebanon to hold state gasoline tender on trial basis - caretaker minister</h1>

      <p>BEIRUT — Lebanon will hold a state tender for 95 octane gasoline next month that will cover about 10% of annual needs, its caretaker energy minister told Reuters on Friday, adding the results would determine whether the state becomes a long-term buyer.</p>
      <p>Energy Minister Nada Boustani said the tender was announced after private importers, who mainly procure the country’s gasoline, sought to raise prices after being hit by rising dollar costs on a parallel market. (Reporting by Nadine Awadalla and Eric Knecht; Editing by Jan Harvey)</p>
