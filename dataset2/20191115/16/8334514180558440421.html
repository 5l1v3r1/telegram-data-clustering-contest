      <p>SYDNEY (Reuters) - When I signed up to join a trial run of the world’s longest commercial flight, I expected an exercise in endurance but not steak for breakfast and a physical work-out regime.</p>

      <p>In preparation for its first 19-hour non-stop commercial flight planned for 2022-3, Qantas Airways is carrying out three dummy runs from London and New York to Sydney to test the effects of ultra-long haul flying on passengers, staff and pilots alike.</p>
      <p>Although I travel frequently for my job as a TV journalist, this “research flight” was a whole new experience.</p>
      <p>On board were six test passengers under constant electronic monitoring by the Australian carrier. I and a handful of other journalists largely shared their experience, minus the wires.</p>
      <p>It began with a London sunrise and an early-morning dinner, followed by lights-out as we immediately adopted Sydney time - part of the regime drawn up by a specialist team to coax our body clocks into making the 11-hour leap.</p>
      <p>That meant a sleep-inducing carb-fest of steak sandwich and soup instead of the expected breakfast. I turned down the wine.</p>
      <p>Meal composition and schedules, well-timed exercise and lighting can all “help people adjust better and reduce jetlag”, University of Sydney physiologist Corinne Caillaud told me during the roughly 17,000-kilometre (10,500-mile) flight.</p>
      <p>So after the eight-hour blackout and a breakfast spiked with chilli - to boost the metabolism - Caillaud led regular bouts of stretches and squats, performed in the aisles with varying degrees of enthusiasm by her guinea-pig passengers.</p>

      <p>Besides raising alertness, the airborne work-out is also key to reducing the risk of deep-vein thrombosis on such a long flight.</p>
      <p>The meals, sleep schedules and encouragement to exercise are likely to figure to some extent in the cabin service eventually offered to Qantas’ commercial customers on these routes.</p>
      <p>To fly direct to Sydney with a full passenger load, Qantas will need a longer-range plane than the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner we flew in, which was more than three-quarters empty.</p>
      <p>The airline is betting that customers will pay more to avoid stop-offs. The new aircraft it’s poised to order from Boeing or Airbus will have cabin features tailored to ultra-long haul, and unprecedented space in coach class.</p>
      <p>The interiors will offer a “very designed product for long-haul travel”, as Qantas CEO Alan Joyce explained to me during the flight.</p>
      <p>“Our intention is to have a bigger seat pitch in economy than we’ve ever done before, and have dedicated stretching areas in economy.”</p>
      <p>So how did I sleep?</p>
      <p>I didn’t, in fact - not a wink. But then, I was working.</p>

      <p>And although I can’t be sure, the carefully scheduled meals and blackouts may have left me feeling slightly less destroyed than I otherwise might after soldiering through two sunrises, with a final flight time of 19 hours and 19 minutes.</p>
      <p>More reassuringly, the test passengers did largely manage to sleep on cue, and fared much better.</p>
      <p>“I feel really well,” Andy Chevis, a Sydney-based management consultant, exclaimed during the final approach. “Probably a lot better than I normally would at this point in the flight.”</p>
