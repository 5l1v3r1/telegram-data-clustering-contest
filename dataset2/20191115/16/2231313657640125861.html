      <h1>3 Top Dividend Stocks With Yields Over 4%</h1>
      <h2>A leading wireless carrier, a cruise line powerhouse, and an amusement park operator have plenty of share price upside to go along with their hefty quarterly distributions.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T16:30:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 16:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fool.com/author/1280/" target="_blank">Rick Munarriz (TMFBreakerRick)</a></address>
      <p>There's more to some chunky yields than meets the eye. Folks may <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/your-definitive-dividend-investing-guide.aspx">invest in dividend stocks</a> largely for the income, but sometimes these equities offer a good shot at capital appreciation, too. </p>
      <p><b>AT&amp;T</b> (<a href="https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/att/t/">NYSE:T</a>), <b>Carnival</b> (<a href="https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/carnival/ccl/">NYSE:CCL</a>), and <b>Six Flags Entertainment</b> (<a href="https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/six-flags/six/">NYSE:SIX</a>) all offer yields north of 4% at the moment, but that's not all. The telecom giant, cruise line leader, and amusement park operator also have the potential to deliver overall returns that beat the market.</p>

      <h3>AT&amp;T: 5.2% yield</h3>
      <p>There are a lot of moving parts to the AT&amp;T story. It's one of the two top carriers in the booming U.S. wireless market, and it's also benefiting from the "content is king" trend thanks to its hard-fought acquisition of Time Warner. But it's swimming against the current when it comes to its legacy wireline business and its DirecTV satellite television service -- both of those platforms continue to shed customers. </p>
      <p>However, the ultimate moving part to AT&amp;T these days is the stock itself. The shares are up 37% so far this year, beating the market -- and their total return is 45% once you factor in the company's beefy quarterly distributions. An activist shareholder sparked interest in the telecom over the summer, implying that it was undervalued, which impelled it to announce a <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/10/28/att-lays-out-3-year-plan.aspx">three-year deleveraging plan</a> last month under which it will use its free cash flow to gnaw away at its hefty debt and reduce its outstanding share count. AT&amp;T forecasts marginal top-line growth in the coming years, but says its bottom line should explode to produce earnings per share between $4.50 to $4.80 come 2022. With the stock trading at just 8 to 9 times that profit forecast -- and with 35 consecutive years of annual dividend hikes creating a pattern it will be loathe to break -- buying into AT&amp;T seems like a pretty good call here.  </p>
      <h3>Carnival: 4.5%</h3>
      <p>While AT&amp;T investors have been having a good year, Carnival shareholders have been sailing through choppier waters. The world's largest cruise line operator has been bucking the market's upward trend since February, producing a year-to-date slide of more than 10%. It has trimmed its full-year earnings guidance in <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/09/26/carnival-stock-sinks-after-another-mixed-quarter.aspx">each of the past three quarters</a>, blaming everything from weather-related disruptions to rising tensions in the Arabian Gulf for its softening outlook.</p>
      <p>The cruising behemoth that was once hoping to earn as much as $4.80 a share this year now expects net income of no more than $4.27 a share. Fluctuations in fuel prices and exchange rates, as well as the U.S. government's policy change on Cuba as a port of call, have been eating away at its financials.</p>
      <p>The combination of a sinking price and a steady dividend has resulted in Carnival's yield moving from barely above 4% when the year began to 4.5% now. The good news here is that demand for cruise vacations generally remains strong. Its net revenue yields continue to grow by mid-single-digit percentages, and advance bookings through the first half of fiscal 2020 are ahead of where they were a year earlier. With many of the factors sapping Carnival's bottom line looking like one-off issues, now might be a good time to cruise into the stock.  </p>
      <h3>Six Flags: 7.3% </h3>
      <p>The fattest dividend yield of these three stocks belongs to an investment that has been on as wild a ride as some of its signature coasters. The stock is down nearly 20% in 2019, and a good chunk of that drop came after its <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/10/23/why-six-flags-stock-was-falling-today.aspx">poorly received third-quarter report</a>. Revenue was flattish during the key summer quarter, as attendance gains came mostly from its growing base of annual passholders -- people who don't spend as much in the parks per trip as its more infrequent visitors. </p>
      <p>Six Flags has now fallen short of Wall Street's profit targets in back-to-back quarters. It also doesn't help that it was <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/10/05/3-reasons-cedar-fair-shot-down-six-flags.aspx">reportedly thwarted</a> in an attempt to acquire a highly esteemed peer in a $4 billion deal. The good news here is that things could start to change for better starting next week, when former <b>PepsiCo</b> (NASDAQ: PEP) exec Mike Spanos becomes the company's new CEO. He will inherit a growing membership base of regulars, and has several months to implement new strategies to woo more of those spendthrift non-passholders before most of Six Flags' parks reopen next spring. </p>
