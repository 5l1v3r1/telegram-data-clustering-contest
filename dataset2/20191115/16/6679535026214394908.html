      <h2>Beats Nagal in two tight sets, meets Duckworth</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T16:54:46+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 16:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Nandakumar-Marar-1197/" target="_blank">Nandakumar Marar</a></address>
      <p>Ramkumar Ramanathan overcame Sumit Nagal’s challenge, winning their quarterfinal 6-4, 7-6(5), in the KPIT MSLTA Challenger at the MSLTA School of Tennis courts, Balewadi sports complex, on Friday. Ramkumar, who won on the strength of his serves and sharp play in the tie-breaker, booked a semifinal against Australia’s James Duckworth.</p>
      <p>Ramkumar gained a crucial break in the 10th game to win the first set when Nagal committed a few forehand errors and dropped serve. The latter, however, tightened his game till 3-3 in the second before going off-target with his serve in the seventh. Though Nagal broke back in the next game to pull level, he was wayward in the ninth game and dropped serve again.</p>
      <p>The sixth-seeded Ramkumar, riding on his serve-and-volley game, relished the faster hardcourts here. He entered the doubles semifinal too, partnering Purav Raja. The two eased past the Tunisian-French combine of Aziz Dougaz and Calvin Hemery 6-3, 6-4.</p>
      <p>Ramkumar’s last-four opponent, Duckworth, got past a spirited Sasi Kumar Mukund, seeded eighth, in three tight sets.</p>
      <h3>Olmado vs Clark</h3>
      <p>Spain’s Roberto Ortego Olmado will face England’s Jay Clark in the other semifinal. While Olmado won the first set against Dutchman Tim van Rijthoven when the latter retired, Clark was taken the distance by Canada’s Steven Diaz before winning the decider in the tie-breaker.</p>
