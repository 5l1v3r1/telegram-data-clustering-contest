        <b>A MAN in a Celtic top was spotted doing an Ibrox stadium tour...before visiting Parkhead in a Rangers jersey.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Light Blues fans were stunned earlier today to see the man wearing a <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Hoops</a> shirt with Callum McGregor's name on his back at Ibrox.</p>

        <figcaption>The Celtic 'fan' was spotted at Ibrox</figcaption>

      <p>But all was not as it seemed as the same 'supporter' was later pictured at Celtic Park in a <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14923/rangers/">Rangers</a> top.</p>
      <p>The 'supporter', who had a camera and tripod with him on both tours, is actually the YouTuber behind the Ultimate Bucket List channel.</p>
      <p>Ninh Ly has toured several grounds around Europe dressed in the kit of the home team's rivals for his videos.</p>
      <p>These have included visiting Liverpool's Anfield and Manchester City's Etihad stadiums in a Manchester United kit.</p>

        <figcaption>The man also visited Celtic Park in a Rangers jersey</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>And his trip to visit both sides of the Old Firm was just the latest trips on his list.</p>
      <p>That didn't stop both Rangers and Celtic fans aiming digs at Ly, as well as each other in general, on social media however.</p>
      <p>@Ritchie_bjk said: "I wouldn't have let him in with that top on."</p>
      <p>@JamesyMc55 added: "Seeing what a real institution looks like...let them come after us, we welcome the chase."</p>
      <p>@Windsorrocker commented: "Well we all hear how Celtic are 'everyone's second team' but I didn't think that meant <b>EVERYONE</b>..."</p>
      <p>And @GrizzleyBear72 said: "That's a caption competition if ever I saw one...the look on that guy's face is a picture."</p>
