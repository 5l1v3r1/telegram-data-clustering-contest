      <h1>Samsung’s rumoured second Galaxy Fold to launch in Canada</h1>
      <h2>Hopefully it's a lot cheaper than the original</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T16:35:40+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 16:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/dean-daley" target="_blank">Dean Daley</a></address>
      <p>It looks like Samsung will eventually bring a <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/04/16/samsung-galaxy-fold-hands-on/">Galaxy Fold series phone</a> to Canada.</p>
      <p>16-year-old tech leaker <a href="https://twitter.com/Patrick_ORourke/status/1195336720633540611">Ishan Agarwal (</a><a href="https://twitter.com/ishanagarwal24">@ishanagarwal24</a>) says that the rumoured ‘SM-F700’ 4G-only Galaxy Fold device will launch in two colours, black and purple. Additionally, Agarwal states that this foldable smartphone will come to multiple countries, including Canada.</p>

      <p>The upcoming Fold handset is rumoured to sport 256GB of internal storage, along with a more affordable price tag.</p>
      <p>The original Galaxy Fold was initially planned to come to Canada, but due to issues with the display and other concerns, the device didn’t get widely released.</p>
      <p><a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/06/25/samsung-plans-6-7-inch-foldable-clamshell-phone/">Previous rumours</a> and <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/10/29/samsung-galaxy-fold-vertical-display-teaser/">Samsung itself</a> indicate that the South Korean company will launch a Fold that folds in a clamshell similar to the <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/11/14/motorola-razr-hands-on-foldable-flip-phone/">new Motorola Razr.</a> It’s unclear if the foldable Agarwal’s is talking about is that same device.</p>

      <p>It’s important to note that Agarwal’s response to <i>MobileSyrup’s</i> managing editor <a href="https://twitter.com/Patrick_ORourke?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Patrick O’Rourke (@Patrick_ORourke)</a> asking if the phone will release in Canada, indicates there’s still a possibility Samsung could change its mind regarding releasing the new Fold here.</p>
