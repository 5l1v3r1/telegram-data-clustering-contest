      <p>PASCO COUNTY, Fla. â€” A Pasco County woman is in jail after a video was sent into Pasco County Sheriffs showing abuse towards a child.</p>
      <p>A police report states Jenna Leigh Johns, 28, can be seen punching a child in the face and stomach multiple times.</p>
      <p>Police reached out to the victim who was five years old and told police when Johns drinks alcohol; she gets physical with him.</p>
      <p>When questions, Johns says, she blacked out and did not remember the incident. She then remembered what happened and said the child was misbehaving, and she did not hit him.</p>
      <p>Johns was arrested and charged with child abuse.</p>
