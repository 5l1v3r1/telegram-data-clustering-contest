      <p>We all know <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dogs/">dogs</a> bring joy into our lives, but new research says they could be working wonders for our relationships, too.</p>
      <p>A recent study has found that couples who share a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/christmas-pop-dedicated-cats-dogs-opens-london-11151728/">dog</a> are happier than those who do not.</p>
      <p>The survey, carried out by Rover.com, found that 60% of couple owners said that bringing up a dog together made their relationship stronger.</p>
      <p>What’s more, half of the participants said their canines had helped them spend quality time together, as a couple.</p>
      <p>Nothing beats a romantic walk in the park, after all.</p>
      <p>Around 88% of those surveyed said raising a mutt requires teamwork and 65% agreed that trust is needed, too. Both are important factors needed for a relationship to thrive.</p>
      <p>The study also showed that 43% found their partner sexier after getting a dog together.</p>
      <p>Adorable.</p>
      <p>While there are plenty of positives to sharing a pooch, one in six did say their sex life had taken a turn for the worse – due to their fact their dog usually shares the bed with them.</p>

      <p>Those in relationships were not the only ones who said that dogs are important for an individual’s love life.</p>
      <p>In terms of finding a partner, 36% of people admitted that it would be a deal-breaker if someone they were dating was not a ‘dog person’.</p>
      <p>Hayley Quinn, dating expert for Match says co-parenting a pet requires compromise and communications skills.</p>
      <p>She says, ‘Getting a dog together is a huge commitment.</p>
      <p>‘Owning a pet together can improve the quality of your relationship. Seeing your partner demonstrate their emotional traits, such as care and compassion, can be extremely attractive and, as this study shows, increases sexual desire.’</p>
