      <p>Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday said four real estate <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/companies">companies </a>from three cities, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad, have approached to avail Rs 25,000 crore bailout fund.</p>
      <p>More <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/companies">companies </a>are likely to approach the nodal agency for taking benefit of this window from next week, she said.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, the government approved a Rs 25,000 crore fund to help complete over 1,600 stalled housing projects, including ones that have been declared NPAs or admitted for insolvency proceedings in a bid to boost growth by steering consumption in real estate and associated sectors.</p>
      <p>The Alternative Investment Fund (AIF) comprises of Rs 10,000 crore coming from the government and the remaining being provided by state insurer LIC and the country's largest lender SBI.</p>
      <p>The fund, to be set up as Category-II AIF registered with SEBI, will be managed by SBICAP Ventures Limited.</p>
      <p>The AIF, which was first announced by the Finance Minister on September 14, will act as a 'special window' to provide loans to over 1,600 incomplete affordable and middle-lower income housing projects.</p>
      <p>She further said that she will be holding a meeting with banks next week to assess their lending to the NBFC sector.</p>
      <p>The ministry will seek disaggregated data on how much funds have been given to AAA-rated NBFCs and NFBCs rated below AAA and also seek details from RBI and PSU Banks on funds given to AAA-rated NBFCs, investment-grade NBFCs, she added.</p>
