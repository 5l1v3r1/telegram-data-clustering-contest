      <p>Kanye West is making sure his flock will flock to see him during his Sunday Service with Joel Osteen.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News) </b>Kanye West and preacher Joel Osteen are offering 45,000 free tickets to watch the rapper perform his Sunday Service show.</p>
      <p>The "Jesus Walks" hitmaker and his gospel choir will be at several services at Lakewood Church in Houston, Texas on Sunday (November 17th), with 45,000 tickets available for an evening performance.</p>
      <p>Church officials have teamed up with Ticketmaster to offer the free tickets, which will be available online on Friday on a first-come-first-serve basis.</p>
      <p>An earlier service, which will feature West in a 20 to 30-minute conversation with Osteen, a televangelist who preaches faith can bring you material wealth, is not ticketed - meaning only those who arrive first will be seated.</p>
