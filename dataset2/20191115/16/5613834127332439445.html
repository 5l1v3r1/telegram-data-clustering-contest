      <p>In the wake of its world premiere at Fantasia earlier this year, <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/ifc-midnight-wretched-fantasia-brett-drew-pierce-1202786993/">Deadline</a> reports today that<b> IFC Midnight</b> has acquired North American rights to occult horror film <i><b>The Wretched</b></i>.</p>
      <p>Written &amp; directed by <b>Brett and Drew Pierce</b> (<i>Deadheads</i>), it’s set for 2020 release.</p>
      <p><a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/3574259/fantasia-review-the-wretched-merges-unique-creature-feature-rear-window/">Meagan reviewed <i>The Wretched</i> for us at Fantasia</a>, writing: “The Pierce brothers have delivered a new dark fairy tale that the midnight crowds will enjoy.”</p>
      <blockquote><i>The Wretched </i>follows a defiant teenage boy, struggling with his parent’s imminent divorce, who faces off with a thousand year-old witch, who is living beneath the skin of the woman next door.</blockquote>
      <p><i>The Wretched</i> stars<b> John-Paul Howard</b> (“Hell or High Water”), <b>Piper Curda</b> (<i>I Didn’t Do It</i>), <b>Azie Tesfai</b> (“Supergirl”), and<b> Kevin Bigley</b> (Netflix’s “Upload”).</p>
      <p>The fest had described it as “a dead serious new spin on witchcraft cinema, with a fresh set of rules, likeable and developed teen characters, a ton of surprising scares, and a cauldron of imaginatively gruesome special makeup effects.”</p>
