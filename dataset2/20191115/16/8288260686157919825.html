      <h3>Why are we having an early election?</h3>
      <p>A general election - which determines who runs the country - normally happens every five years.</p>
      <p>There are 650 constituencies, where voters are invited to select an MP to represent their area.</p>
      <p>Nearly three-and-a-half years ago voters were called to the ballot box to decide whether the UK should remain in or leave the European Union.</p>
      <p>The majority chose to leave and we were supposed to have left on March, 29 this year, however, it has since been delayed after MPs failed to back plans put forward by former Prime Minister Theresa May and now Boris Johnson.</p>
