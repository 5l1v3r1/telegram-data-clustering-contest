      <h1>Germany passes law making measles vaccination compulsory for children</h1>
      <h2>Teachers and hospital staff must also be immunised, law says</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Germany">Germany</a>’s parliament has approved a law making it compulsory for schoolchildren to be vaccinated against <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/measles">measles</a>.</p>
      <p>The measure passed with a massive majority on Thursday, mandating that all children who attend school or nursery must be inoculated.</p>
      <p>Politicians approved the government bill by 459 in favour to 89 against. There were 105 abstentions.</p>
      <p>The law means parents who are unable to prove their offspring have been vaccinated against measles by 1 August 2021 - or those who refuse - will be fined up to €2,500 (£2,150).</p>
      <p>Jens Spahn, Germany’s health minister, said compulsory vaccination was necessary because of an increase in cases of measles, a highly contagious and potentially fatal disease.</p>
      <p>Measles was “too often underestimated”, Mr Spahn said.</p>
      <p>“It’s about the protection of the weakest, the little ones who can not be vaccinated until the end of the first year of life."</p>
      <p>Teachers and daycare workers, staff in hospitals and residents of refugee shelters will also have to be vaccinated after the law comes into force in March 2020.</p>
      <p>Germany has recorded 501 cases of measles so far this year.</p>
      <p>The law’s passage comes after a global study found Europeans were more likely than anyone else in the world <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/anti-vaxx-vaccination-myth-poll-europe-pro-nature-birth-a8964441.html">to believe myths that claim vaccines are unsafe</a> or ineffective.</p>
      <p>The continent has seen a dramatic resurgence in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/europe-measles-outbreak-anti-vaxx-uk-albania-greece-czech-republic-a9083271.html">measles infections</a> with almost 90,000 diagnosed between January and June this year, the World Health Organisation said in August.</p>
      <p>The UK lost its measles-free status this year after being declared free of the disease in 2017. The Royal College of GPs warned of a decline in take-up of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, saying that the country was “still suffering from entirely debunked claims around MMR that ... are now resurgent on social media”.</p>

      <p>Earlier this year, a massive study of more than 650,000 children again <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/mmr-vaccine-autism-antivax-measles-study-andrew-wakefield-a8808086.html">disproved the alleged link between MMR and autism</a>. The conspiracy was originally promoted by a now-disgraced UK doctor who was struck off for ethics violations.</p>
      <p>British ministers are considering introducing compulsory vaccinations for children in state schools, health secretary Matt Hancock said earlier this year.</p>
