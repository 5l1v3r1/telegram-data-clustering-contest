      <p>​For the longest time, speculations about Manushi's debut film have been making the rounds in the Indian media, but the 22-year-old beauty queen took two years after shooting to fame to zero in on “Prithiviraj” as her first movie.</p>
      <p>The film's story is inspired by the life of "Maharaj" (Emperor) Prithivi Raj Chauhan – who ruled Delhi and India’s “Pink City” – Jaipur from 1178 to 1192.</p>
      <p>While Akshay will play the role of Pritiviraj, Manushi will be seen portraying the role of his love interest named Sanyogita in the movie, slated for release in November 2020.</p>
      <p>On his 52nd birthday this September, Akshay officially announced his first-ever period drama movie.</p>

      <p>After winning the pageant, Manushi applied for a leave from her college and moved to Mumbai with her parents.</p>
      <p>The diva wishes to complete the rest of her course, however, <a href="https://medicaldialogues.in/%20mci-bog-refuses-nod-to-former-%20miss-world-manushi-chillar-%20for-mbbs-migration/">recent reports reveal</a> that the Medical Council of India Board of Governors (MCI BOG) has refused to grant Manushi a transfer from her Haryana college to a Mumbai-based medical college. </p>
