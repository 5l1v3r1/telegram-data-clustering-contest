      <p>Nov. 15 (UPI) -- A website is offering a "dream job" for a holiday-loving person looking to make $1,000 watching 24 Hallmark Christmas movies.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.centurylinkquote.com/get-paid-to-watch-hallmark-christmas-movies">Centurylinkquote.com said</a> the winning "Hallmark Dream Job" applicant will receive $1,000, a streaming service subscription and a "movie watching kit" including cookies, cocoa, a mini Christmas tree and some Hallmark merchandise.</p>
      <p>"We're looking for a lover of all things Christmas, G-Rated romcoms, and too-close-to-home family dramas to watch 24 Hallmark Christmas movies in 12 days," the posting website states.</p>
      <p>The site says the chosen person will be called upon to document their Christmas movie binge on social media.</p>
      <p>"We want you to have opinions-lots of them! Think the grumpy Grandpa turned jolly Santa was a little overdone? Felt like the plot was a bit half-baked? Be as honest as possible in your review," it says.</p>
      <p>Interested movie lovers are being encouraged to apply online and prepare a short video explaining why they would be the ideal candidate.</p>
