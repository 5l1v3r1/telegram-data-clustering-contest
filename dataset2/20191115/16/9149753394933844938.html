      <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/smite/">Smite</a>'s next playable character is Heimdallr the Vigilant, the Norse god who wields the powerful horn Gjallarhorn and the son of Nine Mothers. Heimdallr has been a possibility the Smite community has discussed for some time, and Hi-Rez has announced that he's finally arriving in the game next month—although in a role that may be a surprise for many fans.</p>
      <p>See, Heimdallr is a big, burly Norse god, with arms big enough to hoist Gjallarhorn and a pair of mean-looking axes. But instead of a guardian or warrior role, Hi-Rez has cast Heimdallr as a hunter, which are generally more agile, lithe characters like Apollo, Jing Wei, and Neith.</p>
      <p>Smite lead game designer AJ Walker says his team wanted Heimdallr to feel unique.</p>
      <p>"When we made our next physical hunter, we wanted them to feel different from the rest of our hunters, which is why we picked this character who's a bigger, stronger, armored Viking who throws these giant axes," Walker explained to PC Gamer. "We're intentionally breaking some of [the community's] expectations with Heimdallr because a lot of people perceived him to be a guardian or warrior—very tanky, very stoic, very defensive."</p>
      <p>That said, the important lore elements the community was expecting for Heimdallr, like his horn and sword, will all feature into his abilities and equipment, Walker said.</p>
      <p>While Walker wasn't ready to go into specifics on Heimdallr's abilities yet, they're each highlighted in the new trailer above. And Walker gave us a general idea of what to expect from Heimdallr on the field.</p>
      <p>One of his abilities, for example, is a mixture of a warding or vision with a shaped skillshot component. Another is a disruptive, channeled area of attack spell. And Heimdallr gets around using Bifrost, the rainbow bridge that connects Asgard with the world of humans.</p>
      <p>As Hi-Rez's design team developed Heimdallr, they experimented with some ideas that didn't make the final cut. One of those was the ability to trigger Ragnarok by blowing Gjallarhorn.</p>
      <p>"What that meant was we would spawn five evil Norse gods and five good Norse gods that would have a giant fight on top of your fight, and you would have to dodge them killing each other and knocking each other around," Walker said. "We were like, that's a little too crazy maybe, or a little too confusing. But we had all sorts of interesting ideas for him."</p>
      <p>We'll be able to try Heimdallr for ourselves when he arrives in Smite in December. The Hi-Rez Expo 2019 is currently underway in Atlanta, Georgia. It runs through this weekend, and you can watch <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/smitegame">live on Twitch</a>.</p>
