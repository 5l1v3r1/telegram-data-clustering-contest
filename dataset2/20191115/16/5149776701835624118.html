      <p>The people of Nottingham are being invited to have their say on fresh plans for the City Ground.</p>
      <p>A new image of the proposed redevelopment of Nottingham Forest’s famous home were revealed on Friday morning, with the club keen to receive feedback on their grand plans to turn the City Ground into a world class venue.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-city-ground-redevelopment-3541269">The club</a> want supporters along with local residents and business owners to get involved and ‘shape the future of this historic football club’ by commenting on the plans.</p>
      <p>“On a project like this there’s a huge amount of things that you have to bring together,” said <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-reveal-amazing-new-3540790">Tom Cartledge</a> lead architect and CEO of Benoy who are leading the project.</p>
      <p>“We’ve done a lot of consultation work, both within the club - working with the players and the management to understand what world-class facilities look like for them <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/match-reports/nottinham-forest-derby-county-analysis-3521884"><b>on matchdays</b> </a>, in terms of changing rooms and other facilities.</p>

      <p>“But then also working with the corporate team here to really understand what the opportunities are for a diverse mix of premium seating.</p>
      <p>“And then you’re also really looking at the stadium and the stand itself, in terms of its design and how it’s in keeping with the other stands and respecting the local community and the neighbourhood - as well as the challenges around integrating what is a large building into an urban area.</p>
      <p>“There has been a huge amount of work and the work doesn’t stop now.”</p>
