      <h1>Commerce At The Speed Of Instant</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T16:00:15+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pymnts.com/author/pymnts/" target="_blank">PYMNTS</a></address>
      <p>When the question is about how to do something better as we head into the 2020s, the answer is to make it <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/faster-payments/2019/can-real-time-data-render-credit-scores-obsolete/">faster,</a> make it digital and make it <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/retail/2019/why-the-future-of-brick-and-mortar-isnt-about-sales">easier to access</a>. Big ships turn slowly – <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/data/2019/tch-gives-banks-an-open-banking-template/">established infrastructure</a> is hard to change, and ingrained practices aren’t easy to shift overnight, even if <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2019/bending-card-rails-for-b2b-payments-optimization">no one likes them</a>. But turn they ultimately will – because the consumer has spoken, and made it clear that they want the ability to transact instantly – and <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/payments-innovation/2019/simple-will-be-instant-payments-breakthrough-innovation/">they want it now.</a></p>
