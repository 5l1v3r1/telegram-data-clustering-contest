      <p>Cricketer-turned-politician Gautam Gambhir has hit out at the Aam Aadmi Party and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for what he said was the propaganda run against him after he skipped a parliamentary meeting on air pollution. Gambhir, who’s currently on cricket commentary duty for India-Bangladesh cricket series, took a jibe at Kejriwal saying that his constituents will judge him by his work and not ‘propaganda or false narrative spread by the minions of the ”honest CM” of Delhi.</p>

      <p>The statement shared by him on Twitter read, “..I have complete faith in the people of my constituency, my city and my country. They will judge me by my work and not by the propaganda and false narrative spread by the minions of the ”honest CM” of Delhi. My commitment to my constituency and my city should be judged by the work that is happening there.”</p>
      <p>Highlighting key initiatives started by him after getting elected to parliament from the East Delhi constituency in May this year, Gambhir said that he had not entered politics to make money. “But I do have a family to support. I believe in hard-earned money and not using public funds to further political ambitions,” he added.</p>
      <p>The East Delhi MP said he has been taking steps to fight pollution, which include a plan to install giant air purifiers in his constituency. He continued, “This is not even 1 per cent of what I intend to do in the next 4.5 years. We are also in talks to install giant air purifiers with cutting edge technology, across the constituency which will substantially reduce pollution. The pilot version will be installed within the next few weeks.”</p>

      <p>Gambhir came under attack from the AAP after his former India teammate VVS Laxman shared a photo of them enjoying <i>jalebi </i>and <i>poha </i>at a food joint in Indore, where India and Bangladesh are playing the first Test of the series.</p>

      <p>Delhi goes to polls in February next year and both the AAP and the BJP will aim to outsmart each other in a bid to form the government in the national capital.</p>
      <p>During Friday’s parliamentary panel’s meeting on air pollution, only four out of 28 MPs attended the meeting. A report by news agency PTI said that several top officials of the environment ministry, Delhi Development Authority and municipal commissioners also skipped the meeting.</p>
      <p>Gambhir said that the ruling AAP was singling him out to mask the ‘incompetence and political greed’ of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.</p>
      <p>“Making my commercial engagements (which were entered into before I had become an MP) an issue to mask the incompetence and political greed of their leader is the saddest thing that the party, which claims to represent honest people, could do,” Gambhir said.</p>
