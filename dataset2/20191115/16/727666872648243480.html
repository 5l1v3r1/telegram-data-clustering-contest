      <p>Lil Kim is big mad, big mad!</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop Rumors) </b>Lil Kim is not one to hold back! She is going on again about how Naturi Naughton and her portrayal of the pint sized rapper! Why!? </p>
      <p>Here are the cliff notes from Lipstick Alley! Since Lakeith shouted them out, I have been tickled pink. LOL!<i> </i></p>
      <p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Got a check for the movie after getting lawyers involved</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>would've never picked Naturi</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Says they have nothing in common</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Teyana Taylor would've killed it</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Says Naturi was disrespectful on the TV One Uncensored show</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Says she could really go in on Naturi</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Says Naturi basically did it for the come up</i>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>I have a few thoughts on it. First of all, this ain't new information. Lil Kim has never really felt Naturi at all, and most of us say it is because she is darker skinned. Naturi is beautiful and really not that far off from Lil Kim from the Biggie era. She may not be "hood" as Kim was but so what! She's an actor! Anyway, Kim is dope, but this is a thing she should have taken up with casting, not the actor. </p>
      <p>Did you know Kim dropped an album? Yep, it has been out for weeks. She really needs to come to Hip-Hop aka AlHipHop for an interview. But the gossip sites get the look and they conversation is the same. </p>
      <p>Kim just killed at at the BET Hip-Hop Awards...sheesh! </p>
