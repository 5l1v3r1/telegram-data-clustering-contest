      <p>With an empty house, Katie - who is said to be cash strapped - is even considering escaping the country and going on holiday with her on-off boyfriend, Kris Boyson, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10339603/katie-price-christmas-alone-kids-dads/">The Sun</a> reports.</p>
      <p>"Katie is dreading this Christmas, as she only has her eldest son Harvey at home with her," a source told the newspaper.</p>
      <p>"She says she has nothing to stay in England for as Harvey is likely to remain in residential care, and hates the cold so is looking at going abroad instead.</p>
      <p>"Katie has told her friends that she won't be able to afford decent presents anyway and is leaving it to the children's dads to splash the cash instead."</p>
      <p>ED! has contacted Katie's reps for comment.</p>
