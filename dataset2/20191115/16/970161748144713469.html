      <p>We all like to spoil our pets but one luxurious cat product has got the internet talking.</p>
      <p>Any cat owner will know that felines love to sit up high, surveying their kingdoms.</p>
      <p>So any product which allows a cat to spread itself across at a height, is ideal for the furry creatures.</p>
      <p>Well, such an item does exist and is known as the <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/543208787/cat-mod-bridge">Cat Mod Bridge</a>.</p>
      <p>That’s right, it’s an actual bridge designed specifically for felines.</p>
      <p>The creation, which is currently sold by CatastrophiCreations on Etsy, comes in three different colours: a dark onyx, a brown chestnut and a paler white shade.</p>

      <p>It’s pretty simple to assemble, too – just nail each side to the desired part of a wall.</p>
      <p>There are three different lengths to choose from: a 30, 46 and a 62-inch bridge.</p>
      <p>But the website stresses that the longer the bridge, the more likely it is to sway.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>It says: ‘The 62″ bridge will have more sway to it. So, if your cat may be hesitant because of this then we recommend going with one of the shorter length options.’</p>

      <p>Prices start from £137.73 for the smallest size and go up to £166.09. But considering its quality and design, it seems to be worth the investment and has been a hit with cat owners, so far.</p>
      <p>Many have left comments praising the imaginative piece on Etsy.</p>
      <p>One said: ‘Very sturdy and so Indiana Jones! I can’t wait to get this up on the walls. My Sammie is going to go nuts.’</p>
      <p>Another cat mum posted: ‘My cat is going to love this for Christmas!’</p>
      <p>While another could not stop singing its praises. She said: ‘All the wood is high quality, perfectly smooth finish and didn’t smell like varnish or stain at all.</p>
      <p>‘The pieces were easy to put together and very versatile. I had a tricky wall with strange stud distances and I had no problem with the bridge.’</p>
