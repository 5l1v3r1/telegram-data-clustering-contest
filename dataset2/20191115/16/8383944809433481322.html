      <h1>Turkey won't step back on S-400, senior official says amid F-35 negotiations with Washington</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T16:50:52+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 16:50</time> by <a rel="author">DAILY SABAH</a></address>
      <p>Presidential spokesperson İbrahim Kalın said Friday Turkish and U.S. officials have started negotiations on the F-35 fighter jets and Turkey's acquisition of Russian S-400 missile defense systems.</p>
      <p>"The officials have started working as part of a mechanism to evaluate the impact of Russian S-400s on F-35 jets," Kalın told Turkish state news broadcaster, TRT Haber.</p>
      <p>"It is out of the question for Turkey to take a step back from its purchase of the [S-400] system," the spokesman said.</p>
      <p>After its long efforts to purchase U.S.-made Patriot missiles failed, Turkey acquired two batteries of the Russian-made S-400 air missile defense systems as part of a $2.5-billion deal inked in December 2017.</p>
      <p>The deal caused tension between Ankara and Washington as the latter even threatened sanctions on Turkey. U.S. President Donald Trump, however, has said he was not considering punitive measures.</p>
      <p>The U.S. eventually suspended Turkey, a fellow NATO member, from its F-35 stealth fighter program, in which Turkey is a major manufacturer and buyer.<br/><br/>Washington argues the S-400 would be incompatible with NATO systems and expose the F-35 to possible Russian subterfuge.</p>
      <p>Turkey, however, emphasized the S-400 would not be integrated into the NATO systems and would not pose a threat to the alliance, refusing to step back from the deal with Russia.</p>
