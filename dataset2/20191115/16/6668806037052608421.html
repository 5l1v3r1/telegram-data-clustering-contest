      <p>The trailer revolves around a police officer’s search for a body gone missing from a morgue. The body that is being searched is of a successful business woman Maya (Sobhita Dhulipala). The prime suspect of the is her own husband which is played by Emraan. The investigating officer in the case is played by Rishi Kapoor, who makes his return to the big screen in a rather interesting role. Later, in the trailer we witness another twist in which it is shown that Emraan’s character had been cheating on his wife with another woman, played by Vedhika. What caught our attention in the trailer was that in the last scene, we. See Emraan trying to flush a piece of paper with ‘I love you jaan’ written over it. However, when he realises the police are on the lookout, he ends up swallowing it instead.</p>
