      <p>Ride-hailing application Uber (<a href="https://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:UBER">NYSE:UBER</a>) has seen a busy couple of weeks. Ever since Uber's IPO share-lockup expired, the company's stock price has dipped to record lows. It's also come under the scrutiny of <a href="https://wccftech.com/uber-new-jersey-cornered-tax/">New Jersey's Department of Labor and Workforce</a> for driver misclassification that could make Uber cough up as much as $650 million in unemployment taxes. Uber's former CEO and co-founder Travis Kalanick. hasn't shown the company any love either as he's <a href="https://wccftech.com/uber-travis-kalanick-dumps-more-shares/">offloaded shares worth $703 million</a> since the lockup expiration.</p>
      <p>The idea behind Uber, however, wasn't from Mr. Kalanick. Instead, it's the Canadian Garett Camp who originally thought of using an application to hail a cab ten years back in 2009. And just like Travis Kalanick, Garett Camp has also been busy selling Uber shares this week.</p>

      <h3>Uber's Co-Founder &amp; Board Member Garett Camp Sells 510,000 Shares This Week Following Travis Kalanick's Lead</h3>
      <p>Like office rental application WeWork, Uber (<a href="https://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:UBER">NYSE:UBER</a>) is another example of how a tech unicorn might not remain an attractive offering throughout the course of its life. The corporate success of tech giants such as Apple, Microsoft and Facebook often instills a false sense of optimism in investors who believe that every unicorn will go on and have a smooth ride.</p>
      <p>Uber hasn't had a great time on the stock market, as the company has consistently traded below the $45/share that investors bought the stock at the time of the company's IPO. And ever since the company's stock-lockup has expired, its shares have continued to drop in value.</p>

      <p>In a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000156218019005527/xslF345X03/primarydocument.xml">fresh SEC filing</a>, we've now learned that Uber's first co-founder Garrett Camp offloaded 510,000 shares this week. The sale reduces Mr. Camp's holding to 73 million shares, which is now larger than Mr. Kalanick's. This sale netted Garett a sum total of $13 million, a mere 2% of the amount gained by Travis Kalanick.</p>
      <p>Uber's stock is trading at $26.51 at the time of writing, up by 1.88% from yesterday's closing. The gain is a breath of fresh air for the company which, as we've mentioned above, hasn't seen any love from either the market or its co-founders. Uber also isn't the only 'big idea' company that's stumbled in its early years. Cupertino tech giant Apple was in a much worse condition in the late 1990s when most expected the company to cease operations soon. But now, Apple is one of the world's most valuable tech companies.</p>

      <p>Garett Camp, like Travis Kalanick, sits on Uber's board of directors.</p>
