      <h1>Leeds United chief gives this response to transfer talk over Aston Villa favourite</h1>
      <h2>Latest Aston Villa transfer news includes Leeds' response to link with Liverpool midfielder James Milner</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T16:38:08+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 16:38</time> by <a rel="author">Shane Ireland, https://www.facebook.com/ShaneIrelandJournalist</a></address>
      <p>Leeds United’s director of football Victor Orta has been asked James Milner’s potential return to Elland Road.</p>
      <p>Liverpool midfielder Milner came through the academy setup at Leeds and made over 50 senior appearances for his boyhood club.</p>
      <p>He left to join Newcastle United in 2004 before <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> came calling four years later to sign him on permanent deal after an earlier loan spell in the Midlands.</p>
      <p>Milner has been a key player since arriving at Anfield in 2015 but <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/james-milner-liverpool-contract-villa-17130449">his current deal is due to expire at the end of the season</a> – and there has been talk of a possible return to where it all began.</p>

      <p>But Orta paid short shrift to the speculation, telling <a href="https://www.tuttomercatoweb.com/serie-a/esclusiva-tmw-i-loco-i-bielsa-leeds-monchi-victor-orta-racconta-tutto-1314459">Tuttomercatoweb:</a> “No, no, I don’t say anything about the names.”</p>
      <p>Milner admitted in an interview in October that playing for Leeds again would be “amazing.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Earlier this season, Milner's former Villa team-mate Darren Bent tipped him to re-join the Whites in the not-so-distant future.</p>
      <p>“When you’ve got somebody who’s had a decorated career like he has, there’s only one place he can return,” Bent told <a href="https://www.footballinsider247.com/what-a-story-that-would-be-exclusive-darren-bent-reacts-as-pl-player-plots-leeds-return/">Football Insider.</a> “He was Leeds’ youngest every goalscorer, they love him down there.</p>
      <p>“He doesn’t need the money, the money’s out of it, he’s won all the trophies – I almost said bar the Champions League but he’s won that, he’s won everything there is to win. It is fitting for him to go back there and play where it all started and finish his career there.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“He might become captain, he’s obviously going to do a job at a very, very high level, what a story that would be. I’m sure Bielsa would welcome him with open arms. That experience, he keeps himself in great nick, it wouldn’t surprise me if he did return there.”</p>
      <p>By the time Milner left Villa to join Manchester City in 2010 he had become a firm fan favourite and was even applauded off the pitch in his final game.</p>
