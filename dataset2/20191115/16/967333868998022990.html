      <p>Cricketer-turned-politician Gambhir was not the only politician to skip the meetin organised by Parliament's Standing Committee on Urban Development. Only 4 out of 29 on the list turned up for the meeting.</p>
      <p>The parliamentary committee that called the meeting raised a strong objection over just four MPs turning up for the meeting.</p>
      <p>The meeting was attended by BJP's Jagdambika Pal, Sanjay Singh of the Aam Aadmi Party, Hasnain Masoodi of the National Conference, and C.R. Patil of the BJP.</p>
      <p>The meeting was called on Friday at 11 a.m. after the air quality in Delhi further deteriorated for the fourth consecutive day.</p>
