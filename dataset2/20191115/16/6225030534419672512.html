      <p><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/Bodexpress"><b>Bodexpress</b></a>, the fan favorite who finally broke his maiden last month, will aim for a second score Wednesday at Gulfstream Park West.</p>
      <p>The 3-year-old Bodemeister colt is entered into a $45,000 allowance race going one mile against seven rivals. Emisael Jaramillo will have the mount for the day's seventh race, scheduled for a 4:21 p.m. EST post.</p>
      <p>Bodexpress earned a Kentucky Derby shot thanks to a surprise second-place Florida Derby (G1) effort. He was placed 13<sup>th</sup> on the first Saturday in May, but it was his Preakness Stakes DNF – where he threw jockey John Velazquez at the start, then galloped the rest of the way alongside his rivals – that increased his profile.</p>
      <p>The Gustavo Delgado trainee went nearly five months between starts, not appearing again after the Preakness until a maiden special weight race Oct. 14 at Gulfstream Park West. Bodexpress cruised that afternoon at 1-9 odds, earning his first win in his eighth start.</p>
      <p>“We’ll take it step by step,” Gustavo Delgado Jr., the trainer’s son and assistant, said after that race. “Hopefully he comes back from this race in good shape. He has faced good horses before. The way I see it we can try anything.”</p>
