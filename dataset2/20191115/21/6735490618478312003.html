      <p>A Postmates driver is suing Lizzo for libel, emotional distress, and false light invasion of privacy.</p>
      <p>Back in September, the “Truth Hurts” rapper accused a Postmates delivery person of stealing her food. “Hey @Postmates this girl *******. stole my food,” she wrote Tuesday in a now-deleted tweet that showed Wells’ face. “She [is] lucky I don’t fight no more.”</p>
      <p>Tiffany Wells, 27, <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/435184777/Tiffany-Wells-v-Lizzo">filed court documents</a> against Lizzo on Friday. She claimed Lizzo’s actions struck fear in Wells and directly affected her livelihood.</p>

      <p>“Lizzo lacked reasonable grounds for any belief in the truth of her statements and acted negligently in failing to determine the true facts,” the suit reads.</p>
      <p>It further asserts that Lizzo “acted with actual malice and reckless disregard for the truth when she tweeted the false statements of or concerning [Wells.]”</p>
      <p>Many of Lizzo’s followers indulged in her anger, but a number of people online criticized Lizzo for tweeting the driver’s name to the rapper’s nearly 1 million followers.</p>

      <p>Lizzo later admitted she should not have called out a Postmates driver on Twitter.</p>
      <p>“I apologize for putting that girl on blast,” Lizzo followed up. “I understand I have a large following and that there were so many variables that could’ve put her in danger. Imma really be more responsible with my use of social media and check my petty and my pride at the door.”</p>
      <p>“As soon as Lizzo reached out, we looked into the matter and quickly resolved the issue,” a Postmates spokesperson said. “We apologize to Lizzo for any inconvenience.”</p>
