      <h1>'AFC North football' needs a culture shift after Myles Garrett suspension</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T21:49:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 21:49</time> by <a rel="author">Bill Bender</a></address>
      <p>In the aftermath of the ugly incident involving Cleveland defensive end Myles Garrett <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/steelers-browns-live-score-updates-highlights-thursday-night-football/r6xyx2seq57j1h7obct9hqik3">swinging a helmet at Pittsburgh quarterback Mason Rudolph on Thursday</a>, it is impossible not to look at the calendar and see the Steelers and Browns have a rematch at Heinz Field on Dec. 1.</p>
      <p>How will those teams respond to what happened then?The NFL took the first shot Friday, <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/myles-garrett-suspension-helmet-swing-browns-steelers-fine/p6a4y3lcs6841h6yyhthae7t2">issuing expedited suspensions</a>. Garrett is suspended indefinitely and at a minimum for the remainder of this regular season and playoffs, <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/nfl-must-suspend-myles-garrett-for-season-browns/w7pghbuu4l1t1e1y8s4eipa63">and he should be</a>. Pittsburgh's Maurkice Pouncey got three games, and Cleveland's Larry Ogunjobi received one game. Rudolph did not receive punishment, but he should have been suspended, too.</p>
      <p>That doesn't answer the question about the rematch. Will these teams try to retaliate? What will the NFL do to ensure that the notion of "AFC North football" does not spill overand lead to a serious injury, which was thankfully avoided in Cleveland's 21-7 victory at FirstEnergy Stadium?Hopefully this is the last one on that scaleamong these division rivals.</p>
      <p>
        <b>TIMELINE: <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/afc-north-timeline-browns-steelers-division-violence/1s5mmef8sc0g51xfi7ydanvssj">Browns, Steelers add another incident to AFC North's ugly decade</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>Let's get this part out of the way first:Garrett,who is 6-4 and weighs 271 pounds,could have seriously injured Rudolph (or worse) had the crown of the helmet hit the quarterback instead of the cushion on the back. Garrett's response to Rudolph trying to yank his helmet off first is not justified.</p>
      <p>Those who have watched AFC North football knew this moment was coming. Physical football and dirty hits are part of the division's lore, but it crossed the line for good Thursday and it's on the NFL to draw the line before something more serious happens.</p>
      <p>To be clear, there is nothing wrong with physical, hard-hitting football and rivalries that are just as intense and mean-spirited as the ones as the college campuses in those states. The Steelers and Ravens have done that for years. But even when Pittsburgh's Ryan Clark knocked out Baltimore's WillisMcGaheein the 2008 AFC championship game, it was not on this level.</p>
      <p>

      <p>There is nothing wrong with rubbing a little dirt on those rivalries, either. The three-way rivalry between the Steelers, Browns and Bengals has been like that since the 1970s — an infection that flows through the Ohio River between Ohio and Pennsylvania, breeding contempt and conspiracy theories among the three fan bases.</p>
      <p>Imagine if there were a third family that bickered with theHatfieldsand McCoys. It's like that, butthere's a difference between "Rust Belt tough" and meat-headed stupidity, and Garrett crossed that line for good.</p>
      <p>It is part of a series of ugly incidents in the last four seasons that seemingly peaked onJan. 9, 2016, in aAFC wild-card game between the Steelers and Bengals.</p>
      <p>Pittsburgh won that game, 18-16, but it's best-remembered for <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/bengals-steelers-score-result-ugly-finish-meltdown-penalties-personal-fouls-burfict-adam-jones/y21q1p6lnp971banmi0zlmicx">eight personal fouls and a laundry list of on-field incidents</a> between the teams that kicked into high gear when Pittsburgh linebacker Ryan Shazier knocked out Gio Bernard. Cincinnati's Vontaze Burfict knocked out Pittsburgh's Antonio Brown, too. Steelers assistant coach Joey Porter confronted Burfict on the field. Pacman Jones had a meltdown afterward. It was the ugliest NFL playoff scene possible.</p>
      <p>
        <b>MORE: <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/myles-garrett-helmet-suspension-legal-action/m0x1ofyyrljw107t55wyl5117">Will Myles Garrett face legal action for hitting Mason Rudolph?</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>Those teams managed to top that in a regular-season game on Dec. 4, 2017. Shazier suffered a spinal injury. Pittsburgh'sJuJuSmith-Schuster knocked Burfict out of the game, and Cincinnati's George Iloka hit Antonio Brown with a helmet-to-helmet hit. The Steelers won, 23-20, but Shazier's injury did nothing to suppress the bad blood.</p>
      <p>When asked about the hits and violence afterward, Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger had a three-word response.</p>
      <p>"AFC North football,"he said.</p>
      <p>In a league that must now become more safety-conscious than ever before, that is no longer the acceptable answer. The end of Thursday’s game was irresponsible trash, and it cannot be tolerated.</p>
      <p>Not after the <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/mason-rudolph-injury-update-steelers-qb-helped-off-field-after-scary-hit/1rrmmxw289fc51vhgn1qf7fcwj">shot Rudolph took</a> from Baltimore's Earl Thomas on Oct. 6. Remember Smith-Schuster's <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/juju-smith-schuster-collapses-with-emotion-after-mason-rudolph-injury/8e5c4zl0cphd1vld8vawlz645">reaction to that hit</a>? You thought Rudolph might have been dead from that hit, too. He suffered a concussion, and Thomas was fined $21,000. This was a little bit different than the McGahee hit in 2008.</p>

      <p>Then there was Thursday night.<a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/juju-smith-schuster-injury-update-concussion-helmet-to-helmet/qqjho9rjql641h9wjujdkj3x5">JuJu Smith-Schuster</a> and <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/diontae-johnson-injury-update-bleeding-from-ear-hit/15o3lhds5v2th1ctvn8vj2woua">Diontae Johnson</a> were knocked out of the game on cheap hits. Johnson was bleeding out of his ear.The Browns,a franchise poised to make the move up the AFC North,won the game, but this was the wrong message to send.</p>
      <p>Rudolph <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/mason-rudolph-suspension-myles-garrett/1e9p6e3p28vd31bqe2bgpmst3y">played a role in the incident</a>, but not near to the extent as Garrett. Had Garrett taken Rudolph's helmet and thrown it in the other direction toward the end zone, then he's a hero in Cleveland forever. Now, he's going to be the reason why the Browns more than likely do not make the playoffs. It was an unnecessary action that destroys his reputation and could jeopardize his career. Ask Burfict how that goes.</p>
      <p>None of the four franchises in this division can claim the moral high ground. All four teams have been at fault in the last decade. Burfict, James Harrison, Earl Thomas and now Garrett and many others are responsible for the actions that have pushed these AFC North rivalries over the edge, and those who watch this division closely cannot be surprised at what unfolded Thursday. That's on the coaches in that division, too. This has gone on for long enough.</p>
      <p>Everyone is to blame, and to do that under the guise of "AFC North football" will only lead to the next big incident. That's not how the NFL should be marketing this division in the first place. Not with a game-changing quarterback like Lamar Jackson in Baltimore or a Brett Favre clone in Baker Mayfield in Cleveland. The Steelers and Bengals likely will go to the draft for their future quarterbacks in the next two seasons. This could be the most exciting division in football for the foreseeable future highlighted by great QBs.</p>
      <p>That is how you should market the future of "AFC North football,"and that starts now.Well, in two weeks when Cleveland visits Pittsburgh.</p>
      <p>It's time to clean it up now and mean it before somebody suffers a career-ending injury or worse.</p>
      <p>That is not hyperbole or pearl-clutching either.</p>
      <p>That is just telling you what could happen thenext timethis spillsover.</p>
