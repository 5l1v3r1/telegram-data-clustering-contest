      <h1>Hubble captures portrait of unique spiral galaxy</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T21:02:36+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 21:02</time> by <a rel="author">Brooks Hays</a></address>
      <p>Nov. 15 (UPI) -- NASA shared a new Hubble Space Telescope image Friday featuring a galaxy that looks a lot like the Milky Way upon first glance.</p>
      <p>Like the Milky Way, NGC 772 is a spiral galaxy. It also has several small satellite galaxies circling its outskirts, just as the Milky Way does. Additionally, NGC 772 boasts a long, warped arm of gas, dust and stars. The arm was stretched and distorted by the gravity of one of the passing satellite galaxies.</p>
      <p>But while NGC 772 may <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/2019/hubble-spots-a-curious-spiral/">look like many</a> of the other spiral galaxies photographed by Hubble, its composition and structure are unique. NGC 772 is without a bar; it is an unbarred spiral galaxy.</p>
      <p>Bars are found in the centers of most spiral galaxies. Scientists estimate these pipelines of gas and dust help deliver materials to star-forming regions in the centers of galaxies.</p>
      <p>Unusual or not, the spiral galaxy, <a href="http://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2019/11/A_rival_to_the_Milky_Way">described by scientists</a> at the European Space Agency this week, is easy on the eyes, featuring an attractive "mixture of bright specks of star formation and dark ripples of cosmic dust weaving throughout."</p>
      <p>The unbarred spiral galaxy boasts a diameter of 200,000 light-years, and it is located 116 million light-years away in the constellation of Aries. It is sometimes known as LEDA 7525, UGC 1466 and Arp 78.</p>
