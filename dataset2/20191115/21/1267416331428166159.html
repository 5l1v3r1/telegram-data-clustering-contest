      <h1>Koodo offering 12 months of Amazon Prime with new activations</h1>
      <h2>The offer is only available November 15th to 24th</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T21:35:07+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 21:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/dean-daley" target="_blank">Dean Daley</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.koodomobile.com/phones?">Koodo</a> is offering a pretty sweet deal when you activate a talk, text and data plan.</p>
      <p>When you get a talk, text and data plan online and add the code “AMAZONPRIME” at checkout, you’ll get 12 months of <a href="https://amzn.to/2KpdjZ1">Amazon Prime for free.</a></p>
      <p>Current Prime members can add the promotion on top of their existing membership. The offer is only valid from November 15th until November 24th.</p>
      <p>Telus says the deal excludes Wireless Home Phone, prepaid, talk and text and lastly data-only activations.</p>
      <p>Those who use the promotion will get the membership code in an e-mail within 35 business. Customers also must redeem the code and agree to Prime’s terms and agreements to qualify, says Telus.</p>
      <p>The membership after 12 months automatically renews, so you’ll need to cancel right before the 12 months end if you don’t want to continue paying for the subscription.</p>
      <p>And lastly, the offer only works for <a href="https://amzn.to/2KpdjZ1">Amazon Prime Canada</a>.</p>
      <p>A Prime membership is regularly $79.99 per year and includes faster shipping options, along with access to Prime Video, Amazon’s streaming video service that features original content like <i>Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan, The Boys</i> and <i>The Tick. </i></p>
