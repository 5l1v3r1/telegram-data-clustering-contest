      <h2>Almost half of that was paid out in overtime</h2>

      <p>A report headed to the Waterloo Regional Police Services Board next week has revealed the hefty cost to the service for homecoming.</p>
      <p>It states the service spent $180,000, with over $85,000 of it on overtime expenses.</p>
      <p>They also had to cover the cost for planning ahead of time, as well as all the work after the event, including collecting data for incidents, charges and arrests made. That cost came in at just over $40,000.</p>
      <p>That puts the total policing costs to around $465,000 combined for homecoming and St. Patrick's Day.</p>
      <p>The next board meeting is on Wednesday.<br/>Â </p>
