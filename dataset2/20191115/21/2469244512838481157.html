      <p>A woman was rescued by firefighters after the car she was driving was involved in a crash which resulted in the vehicle falling 15ft.</p>
      <p>At around 6.10pm this evening <a href="https://www.devonlive.com/news/devon-news/live-crash-exeter-tiverton-upexe-3544882">three cars collided on the A396 Tiverton Road</a> between to the Chitterley Business Park and the The Ruffwell Inn in Silverton.</p>
      <p>Devon and Cornwall Police, South Western Ambulance Service and Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue were all called to the scene after it was reported that one car "flipped over a hedge into a field" and then fell 15ft, leaving a woman trapped.</p>
      <p>The 81-year-old man who was in the passenger seat of the car that flipped managed to leave the vehicle on his own.</p>
      <p>A police spokesperson confirmed that there were no other reports that anyone else was injured in the incident at this time.</p>

      <p>The Devon Air Ambulance was requested, although it was not clear whether the woman was taken to the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital via land or air ambulance.</p>
      <p>She is said to have suffered injuries to her head, although the severity of her injuries is not known at this time.</p>
      <p>Melissa Phillips, from Silverton, said: "Air ambulance was on the football pitch. It circled three times before it could land and was shining its spotlight around the school/Roach Lane/ Livingshayes.</p>
      <p>"It seemed like it was struggling to land and had to really scope out the footy field."</p>

      <p>Drivers were urged by the police to avoid the area and find alternative routes as officers closed the road at around 6.30pm to carry out accident investigation work.</p>
      <p>Traffic between Exeter and Tiverton was affected as a result of the closure.</p>
      <p>The road remained closed at 9.45pm and a police spokesperson said it was likely that the road would remain closed for a large part of the night.</p>
      <p>Anyone who has any information on the collision, or witnessed it and may be able to help police with their enquiries, can call 101 or email 101@dcpolice.uk.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, you can report information anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.</p>
