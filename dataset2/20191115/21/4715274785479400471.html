      <p>While only two teams remain in contention in UAAP Season 82 men’s basketball, it’s a wide open race in the 2019 UAAP Cheerdance Competition, which airs LIVE from the Mall of Asia Arena this Sunday (November 17), 2 p.m. on ABS-CBN S+A and iWant.</p>
      <p>Leading the way is the defending champion National University (NU) Pep Squad, which is gunning for its sixth title in seven years of complete and utter dominance in collegiate cheerdance.</p>
      <p>All set to give them a run for their money are the Far Eastern University (FEU) Cheering Squad and the Adamson University (AdU) Pep Squad, who placed second and third last year; and fan favorites and cheerdance rivals the University of Santo Tomas (UST) Salinggawi Dance Troupe and the University of the Philippines (UP) Pep Squad.</p>
      <p>Fans can’t also sleep on the De La Salle University (DLSU) Animo Squad, the Ateneo De Manila University (ADMU) Blue Babble Battalion, and the University of the East (UE) Pep Squad, which have all leveled up in the past years with UE even finishing third in the field in 2017.</p>
      <p>Apart from pride and honor, at stake in the competition are P50,000 for the Champion, P30,000 for the 1<sup>st</sup> Runner-up, and P20,000 for the 2<sup>nd</sup></p>
      <p> Runner-up. First on the mat to showcase their talent and school spirit will be DLSU, followed by UE, UP, ADMU, FEU, AdU, UST, and NU. All will also be participating in the Group Stunts competition, except for Ateneo. ABS-CBN sports anchor Nikko Ramos will host the event with “Upfront” hosts Janeena Chan and Angelique Manto.</p>
