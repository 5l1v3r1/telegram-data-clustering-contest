      <p>A memorial for a Scots teenager killed in the Manchester Arena <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/terrorism">bombing</a> has been given the go-ahead on her home island.</p>
      <p>Eilidh MacLeod from Barra was just 14 when she <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/manchester-arena-bombing-victim-eilidh-10558415">died in the terror attack at Ariana Grande's concer</a> t on May 22, 2017.</p>
      <p>Following the atrocity, her family set up the Eilidh MacLeod Memorial Trust - known as Eilidh's Trust - in her memory.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the trust announced <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/eilidh-macleod-memorial-design-unveiled-14288328">plans for a memorial garden and bronze sculpture</a> on her home island.</p>

      <p>The statue depicts a young woman holding a set of pipes and holding hands with a boy.</p>
      <p>Eilidh played the pipes and the school girl's family wanted it to reflect her passion for music.</p>
      <p>The sculpture will overlook the island of Vatersay where Eilidh spent her early years growing up.</p>
      <p>A post on the Eilidh's Trust Facebook page announced that the Comhairle nan Eilean Siar Council had approved the memorial plan.</p>

      <p>"Our application for the permanent memorial and garden of remembrance has been approved by Comhairle nan Eilean Siar.</p>
      <p>"We are delighted that the council has given Eilidh’s Trust its backing for this.</p>
      <p>"This is an early - but important- step in the development of a memorial, and a quiet space for everyone to reflect on their daily lives and on loved ones who are no longer with us."</p>
