          <b>Warning: There are spoilers ahead for The Boys season 1!</b>

      <p>Amazon Prime’s <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/the-boys"><b>The Boys</b></a> has done a phenomenal job of establishing Homelander as a complex villain. He’s definitely a murderous psychopath masquerading as a beloved superhero. However, the series made Homelander somewhat sympathetic by showing brief flashbacks to his time as a Vought lab rat. Season 2 doesn’t arrive until next summer. But in the meantime, Amazon has shared a new clip that further explores Homelander’s troubled childhood. You can watch it via <a href="https://twitter.com/TheBoysTV/status/1195401075009957889?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1195401075009957889&amp;ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fcollider.com%2Fthe-boys-season-2-filming-wraps%2F">Twitter</a> below.</p>

      <p>The clip is presented as Vought Labs surveillance footage from 1994. “Little Homelander” is in a session with his tutor, identifying images on various slides to prepare him for his eventual role as the corporation’s star-spangled (and very profitable) protector of the innocent. Unsurprisingly, the session goes awry when the hero-in-training goes a little too far.</p>

      <p>Needless to say, Homelander has some mommy issues that he never managed to work out. Viewers also saw this throughout <b>The Boys</b>’ first season, especially during his eerie, sexually-charged interactions with Madelyn Stillwell. Season 2 will likely continue to examine the character’s fragile psyche as he keeps making trouble for Billy Butcher and his team.</p>
