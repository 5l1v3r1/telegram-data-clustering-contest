      <p>Lawyers for President Donald Trump asked the U.S. Supreme Court on Friday to put a hold on a subpoena from a House committee seeking eight years of his financial documents, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/trump-asks-supreme-court-block-house-subpoena-his-financial-records-n1083876">NBC News reported</a>.</p>
      <p>The case may produce the first action by the justices on the growing number of legal battles over access to Donald Trump's financial secrets. A lower court order upholding the subpoena takes effect on Nov. 20.</p>
      <p>Unless the Supreme Court acts quickly, the president's accounting firm, Mazars, will be required to turn the material over.Â </p>
