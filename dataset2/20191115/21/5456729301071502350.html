      <h1>U23 AFCON: Nigeria crash out, to miss Olympic Games</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T21:50:29+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 21:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/363295-u23-afcon-nigeria-crash-out-to-miss-olympic-games.html" target="_blank">Tunde Eludini</a></address>
      <p>The Nigeria U23 team has crashed out of the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt.</p>
      <p>The team despite forcing their South African counterparts to a barren draw on Friday night crashed out of the U23 AFCON which also doubles as the qualifiers for the football event of the Olympic Games billed for Tokyo next year.</p>
      <p>The coach Imama Amapakabo-tutored lads started their campaign in Egypt with a 1-0 loss to Ivory Coast before bouncing back to a 3-1 win over Zambia. But the barren draw on Friday night was inadequate to see them through to the semi final and stay in contention for a place in the Olympic Games.</p>
      <p>With the two group B matches going on simultaneously on Friday, Nigeria needed a victory to seal a place in the final four while considering the outcome of the other game between Ivory Coast and Zambia.</p>
      <p>However, the Nigerian team could not find the back of the net, and with Ivory Coast beating Zambia in the other game, it meant Nigeria finished third.</p>
      <p>Ivory Coast top the group with six points, while South Africa joined them in the semi-final with five points.</p>
      <p>With this development, Nigeria will not be represented in Olympic football event at all as the female team also failed in their bid to qualify.</p>
