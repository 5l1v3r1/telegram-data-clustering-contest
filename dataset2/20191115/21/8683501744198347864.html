      <p>While it’s been a few years since <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/1520249/Conjuring-2"><i>The Conjuring 2</i></a> came out, we actually saw Ed and Lorraine Warren on the big screen this summer in <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/2475468/annabelle-comes-home-review"><i>Annabelle Comes Home</i></a>. The paranormal investigators played by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga returned for the <i>Conjuring</i> Universe spinoff but many horror fans are still eager to see the duo back in a proper <i>Conjuring</i> movie. They’ll get their wish because <i>The Conjuring 3</i> is on the way next year, and star Patrick Wilson teases, it will be a ‘different beast.’ The actor said:</p>
      <blockquote>The process [of making <i>Conjuring 3</i>] was fantastic, and it’s a much different feel. It’s still the same bones; it’s still very much Ed and Lorraine. Again, we are pushing our characters to places they haven’t gone, but the film will be a really nice addition because it’s definitely a different beast. Pun intended.</blockquote>
      <p>Well folks, there are a couple of ways to take Patrick Wilson’s comments to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/midway-star-patrick-wilson-his-aquaman-2-future-1254563">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, and both of them portend very cool and interesting things for <i>The Conjuring 3</i>. The threequel is now <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2474564/the-conjuring-3-has-started-production-see-the-warrens-photo">in post-production</a>, and it sounds like Patrick Wilson had a really good time making it with Vera Farmiga and director Michael Chaves, who has <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1691889/why-losing-james-wan-could-be-good-for-the-conjuring-3">taken over for James Wan</a>. In addition to the new director, Patrick Wilson teased that the new movie has a very different feel.</p>
      <p>What that means in practice, we’ll have to wait and see, but it seems that <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/2470429/the-conjuring-3?pv=search"><i>The Conjuring 3</i></a> will not simply be more of the same for this franchise. <i>The Conjuring 3</i> is going to change things up in some way that results in it having a different feel to what came before. There may be certain perceptions of what a <i>Conjuring</i> movie is, but it seems this third film will be a very different beast, which is an exciting prospect.</p>
      <p>Lest anyone worry that the franchise is departing from what worked so well in the first two entries, Patrick Wilson assured THR that <i>The Conjuring 3</i> is still a <i>Conjuring</i> film. It will contain those obvious quintessential elements of Ed and Lorraine, but it will challenge the duo in new ways and take the series where it hasn’t gone before.</p>
      <p>So what does a <i>Conjuring</i> movie that is a different beast look like? Well, Patrick Wilson, who is currently starring in Roland Emmerich’s <i>Midway</i>, seemingly offered up a not-so-subtle hint at the direction of <i>The Conjuring 3</i> by saying that the pun is intended when talking about the movie as a ‘different beast.’ Although not definitive, that certainly sounds like werewolves (of a sort) will be a part of this third movie.</p>
      <p>James Wan, who will remain on as a producer, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1523309/could-the-conjuring-3-be-about-werewolves-heres-what-james-wan-thinks">addressed the possibility of werewolves</a> in <i>The Conjuring 3</i> years ago, and it seems like that idea could finally play out, even though the plot for the film has yet to be confirmed. The real Ed and Lorraine Warren investigated a man named Bill Ramsey, also known as The Southend Werewolf, so it seems likely Michael Chaves’ film will draw some from that case.</p>
      <p>Combined with Vera Farmiga’s comments about <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2470216/vera-farmiga-says-the-conjuring-3-will-be-massive">how massive this movie will be</a>, there’s a lot for horror fans to be excited about.</p>
      <p><i>The Conjuring 3</i> opens in theaters on September 11, 2020. Check out our guide to see all of <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481896/the-most-anticipated-horror-movies-of-2020">next year’s most anticipated horror movies</a>.</p>
