      <p>Strictly Come Dancing's Emma Barton has threatened to invade the stage during Michelle Visage and Giovanni Pernice's Madonna-inspired performance on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>The pair will perform a couple's choice street/commercial routine to the Queen of Pop's hit 1990 song Vogue.</p>
      <p>Speaking on Strictly spin-off It Takes Two, Barton jokingly said she had warned the pair she might appear on stage during their number at Blackpool's Tower Ballroom this weekend.</p>
      <p>She said: "Just to let you know, I am actually - we have discussed it - I am actually going to make a little appearance on their number.</p>
      <p>"I'm so excited about this. I am so jealous. I just need to do it. I don't know what I am going to do.</p>
      <p>"I said to Michelle and Gio that I am either going to cry or literally wet myself because I am that excited about this number."</p>

      <p>RuPaul's Drag Race judge Visage and her professional partner have incorporated voguing, a style of dancing born from New York City's LGBT ballroom scene, into their routine.</p>
      <p>Visage described the performance, which will also feature backing dancers, as "very special" while Pernice said he had gone outside of his comfort zone.</p>
      <p>She said: "It's Madonna's Vogue and you are just going to have to wait and see because this is a very special performance. What we are going to be doing is voguing. That's how you vogue."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Pernice added: "It's something I have never done in my life. It's comfortable/uncomfortable to do it."</p>
      <p>Also appearing on the show, Christopher Biggins said Visage's presence was "inspirational" because the 51-year-old was "the slightly older woman".</p>
      <p>He said: "I am very excited because I think that Michelle is a very dark horse. She is just wonderful.</p>
      <p>"I like the fact she is the slightly older woman, which I think is very important.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"She is inspirational, you are absolutely right. I think they are going to do so well. I think that together they are brilliant. I am really fighting for them."</p>
      <p>Blackpool's Tower Ballroom celebrated its 125th anniversary in May this year, marking it with an afternoon tea.</p>
      <p>Strictly Come Dancing continues on BBC One on Saturday.</p>
