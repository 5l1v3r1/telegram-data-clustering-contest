      <h1>Schiff: Trump tweets part of 'incriminating acts'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T21:23:34+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 21:23</time> by <a rel="author">Susan Ferrechio</a></address>
      <p>House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff called <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/she-started-off-in-somalia-how-did-that-go-trump-mocks-former-us-ambassador-to-ukraine">President Trump’s Friday tweets</a> against former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch “part of a broader incriminating act,” centering on the impeachable offenses of abuse of power and obstruction of justice.</p>
      <p>Schiff, a California Democrat, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/we-take-this-very-seriously-schiff-accuses-trump-of-witness-intimidation">declared Trump’s tweets an “attack on a witness,”</a> and said it is part of a pattern of witness intimidation that dates back to the criminal trials of his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, and former campaign manager, Paul Manafort.</p>
      <p>“We need to view the president’s actions today as part of a broader and incriminating act,” Schiff said.</p>
      <p>While Yovanovitch criticized Trump during a House Intelligence Committee <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/watch-live-house-intelligence-committee-holds-second-public-hearing">public impeachment hearing</a> on Friday, Trump bashed her on Twitter, saying everywhere she served, including Somalia and Ukraine, “turned bad.”</p>
      <p>He also tweeted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky “spoke unfavorably about her,” in a phone call with Trump.</p>
      <p>Schiff reminded reporters about Trump’s public praise of Manafort, who would not testify against Trump and is now in prison. <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-borrows-rat-nickname-for-michael-cohen-from-matt-drudge">Trump called Cohen “a rat,”</a> after Cohen turned against Trump during Cohen’s criminal trial for tax evasion.</p>
      <p>Schiff also pointed to Trump’s description of anonymous whistleblowers as traitors.</p>
      <p>“This is part of a pattern to intimidate witnesses, and it’s also part of a pattern to obstruct the investigation and obstruct justice.”</p>
      <p>Republicans on the committee dismissed the tweet. Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York said she “disagreed with the tone of the tweet,” but added it had nothing to do with what the GOP and Trump view as an unfair impeachment investigation, where Democrats control the proceedings and limit the GOP and Trump’s defense.</p>
      <p>“This is a constitutional matter,” Stefanik said, referring to the impeachment investigation. “It’s not about tweets.”</p>
      <p>Stefanik dismissed Schiff’s claim that Trump is intimidating witnesses. Yovanovitch delivered hours of testimony, although she described Trump’s tweets as intimidating.</p>
      <p>“The witness was able to answer questions,” Stefanik said.</p>
