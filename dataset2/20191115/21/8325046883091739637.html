        <li>T-Mobile CEO John Legere has no plans to take over WeWork as chief exec, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/15/john-legere-isnt-leaving-t-mobile-to-take-wework-ceo-job.html">CNBC reported on Friday</a>.</li>
        <li>The We Company, WeWork’s parent firm, is reportedly looking for a new chief executive to take over from Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham, who took over as co-CEOs after the ouster of founder Adam Neumann.</li>
        <li>Legere, an executive <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/t-mobile-ceo-john-legere-interview-2016-10">known for his eccentric</a> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/t-mobile-ceo-john-legere-interview-2016-10">personality</a>, was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wework-in-talks-to-hire-t-mobile-ceo-john-legere-11573494028">reportedly</a> one of the company’s candidates for the role.</li>

      <p>T-Mobile CEO John Legere will not be leading the troubled office space company WeWork after all, a new report says.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, the Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wework-in-talks-to-hire-t-mobile-ceo-john-legere-11573494028">reported</a> that parent firm The We Company, which has been <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wework-ipo-fiasco-adam-neumann-explained-events-timeline-2019-9">beset with a series of problems since its aborted IPO,</a> was in talks with the famously eccentric T-Mobile CEO to fill the role of CEO.</p>
      <p>But there are several candidates in the mix, and Legere – who is leading T-Mobile’s proposed takeover of Sprint – has no plans to leave the company, according to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/15/john-legere-isnt-leaving-t-mobile-to-take-wework-ceo-job.html">Alex Sherman from CNBC</a>.</p>
      <p>Cofounder Adam Neumann <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/softbank-takes-control-of-wework-in-bailout-deal-neumann-out-2019-10">was forced out as CEO of We</a> in September, after its public offering turned into a debacle that saw WeWork’s business model come under harsh scrutiny and its valuation tumble. SoftBank, We’s largest outside investor, ultimately bought a majority stake of the company in a deal valuing it at $8 billion.</p>
      <p>The Wall Street Journal’s report on Monday said that We was searching for a new chief executive to replace current co-CEOs Sebastian Gunningham and Artie Minson, who took over after the ouster of Neumann.</p>
      <p>Representatives for T-Mobile or WeWork were not immediately available for comment.</p>
