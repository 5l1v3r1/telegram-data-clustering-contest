      <p>With auction week in New York coming to an end, <i>ARTnews</i> has rounded-up some of the most notable sales achieved in the day sales at Christie’s, Sotheby’s, and Phillips. Below is a listing of new records and top-performing lots from day auctions of 20th-century and contemporary art, as well Impressionist and modern works, at the three houses. (Sotheby’s contemporary sale was still in progress when this article went to press, and this post will be updated with the sale’s complete results.)</p>
      <p>
        <b>IMPRESSIONIST AND MODERN DAY SALES</b>

        <li><b>Sotheby’s Imp-mod</b> day sale realized $53.3 million, up from its $44.7 million total last November. The top lot was <b>Vincent van Gogh</b>‘s 1883 painting <i>Paysan brûlant de mauvaises herbes</i>, selling for $3.14 million, smashing through its $600,000 to $800,000 estimate.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>20TH-CENTURY AND CONTEMPORARY DAY SALES</b>

      <ul>
        <li>Phillips achieved higher results in both its <a href="http://www.artnews.com/2019/11/14/phillips-contemporary-evening-sale-november-2019/">evening</a> and day sale performances this year. At its 20th-century and contemporary art day sale, the auction house racked up $40.22 million, as compared to $34.68 million in November 2018. The sale set new records for 10 artists, including <b>Jaume Plensa, </b>whose stainless steel sculptures<i> Twins I and II</i> from 2009 (est. $600,000 to $800,000) sold for $1.13 million, <b>Larry Poons</b>, for the bright yellow painting <i>Jessica’s Hartford </i>(1965) that sold for $1.15 million, and <b>Dorothea Rockburne</b>, for <i>Oxymoron </i>(1987-88), an oil on linen piece that went for $93,750.</li>

        <li>The auction house set records for several women artists with the sale of <b>Ruth Asawa</b>‘s <i>Untitled (S.387, Hanging Three Separate Layers of Three-Lobed Forms)</i>, ca. 1955, for $4 million, <b>Julie Curtiss</b>‘s 2018 painting <i>Pas de Trois</i> for $423,000, <b>Carrie Mae Weems</b>‘s <i>Kitchen Table Series </i>(executed 1990/printed 2003) for $237,500, and <b>Mary Corse</b>‘s <i>Untitled (DNA Series)</i>, 2016, for $435,000.</li>
