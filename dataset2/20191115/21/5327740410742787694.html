      <h1>CN Rail confirms job cuts as weakening economy cuts into freight volumes</h1>
      <h2>Railroad also said it was affected by a slowdown in the B.C.’s forestry sector</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T21:30:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 21:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.northdeltareporter.com/author/canadian-press-2/" target="_blank">The Canadian Press</a></address>
      <p>Canadian National Railway Co. is confirming job cuts as it deals with a weakening North American economy that has eroded demand for railroad transportation.</p>
      <p>The company said it is “adjusting its resources to demand” but wouldn’t say how many people will be affected.</p>
      <p>It said some employees will be placed on furlough and there will be reductions in both management and union job numbers.</p>
      <p>In October, Canada’s largest railroad operator cut its adjusted earnings per share outlook percentage for 2019 to the high single digits, down from predictions of low double-digit growth.</p>
      <p>Freight volumes came in below expectations in the third quarter and manufacturing has also fallen off, it said.</p>

      <p>The railroad also said it was affected by a slowdown in the B.C.’s forestry sector, where high log prices and dwindling timber supply have prompted shutdowns or curtailments in more than two dozen mills, and due to the weather-delayed grain crop on the Prairies.</p>
      <p>“As explained during CN’s Q3 results, the company is adjusting its resources to demand,” said spokesman Alexandre Boule in a statement.</p>
      <p>“This includes the difficult decision of adjusting its workforce to demand levels by placing some employees on furlough and reducing both management and union job numbers due to a weakening of many sectors of the economy. These adjustments have already started to take place across the network.”</p>
