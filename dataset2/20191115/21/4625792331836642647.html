      <h1>WATCH: House Democrats and hearing attendees applaud Yovanovitch after testimony</h1>

      <p>Democratic members of Congress and those in the hearing room gave Marie Yovanovitch a standing ovation as she left the room following her impeachment testimony.</p>
      <p>Yovanovitch, 61, testified before the House Intelligence Committee as part of the House's public impeachment hearings on Friday. She detailed her contentious relationship with President Trump and claimed that <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/impeachment-hearing-day-two-nunes-reads-latest-call-transcript-yovanovitch-felt-threatened-by-trump">she felt threatened</a> by him and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani.</p>
      <p>Her testimony landed well for House Democrats and many in the hearing room. When her testimony concluded, most of the room broke out in sustained applause.</p>

      <p>Yovanovitch was the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine before Trump removed her from the post. She had also served in several other countries while working in the foreign services.</p>
      <p>During the hearing, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/she-started-off-in-somalia-how-did-that-go-trump-mocks-former-us-ambassador-to-ukraine">Trump live-tweeted</a> his criticisms of Yovanovitch, something Democratic California Rep. Adam Schiff <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/we-take-this-very-seriously-schiff-accuses-trump-of-witness-intimidation">claimed was</a> “witness intimidation.”</p>
      <p>Many agreed with those in attendance that Yovanovitch’s testimony was compelling, including <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/chris-wallace-if-you-were-not-moved-by-yovanovitchs-testimony-you-dont-have-a-pulse">Fox News host Chris Wallace</a>. Following the first half of her testimony, Wallace said, “If you were not moved by the testimony of Marie Yovanovitch today, you don't have a pulse."</p>
