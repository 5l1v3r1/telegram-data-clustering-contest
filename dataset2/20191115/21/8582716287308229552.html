      <p><b>TOKYO — </b>A Japanese man detained by Beijing reportedly on allegations of spying has been released and returned to the country, government officials in Tokyo said on Friday.</p>
      <p>Tokyo confirmed last month that a Japanese man in his 40s had been held by Chinese authorities since September on suspicion of violating Chinese laws, without providing details.</p>
      <p>Japanese media have identified him as a professor from Hokkaido University who was detained on suspicion of spying.</p>
      <p>"We confirmed his return... I'm glad he is back to Japan safely," Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi told reporters without disclosing the details of the charges. "This is a case that Prime Minister (Shinzo) Abe and I strongly pressed on China and this has borne fruit."</p>
      <p>Late last month, Abe strongly demanded "a positive response from China regarding the detention of a Japanese national" when he met China's vice president Wang Qishan.</p>
      <p>The man, who has not been named, previously worked for the National Institute for Defense Studies in the defense ministry and the Japanese foreign ministry, according to local media reports.</p>
      <p>Beijing has faced accusations of using the detention of foreigners as a political tool, with observers calling it "hostage diplomacy".</p>
      <p>In 2017, China detained six Japanese citizens for alleged "illegal activities".</p>
      <p>Since 2015, at least 13 Japanese citizens -- all civilians -- have been detained in China on various charges including espionage, according to local Japanese media.</p>
      <p>Tokyo's ties with Beijing have been at times strained by rows over history and territorial disputes but have improved recently, with President Xi Jinping expected to visit Japan early next year.</p>
