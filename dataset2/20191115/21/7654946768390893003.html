      <p>Jeff Bezos may be eyeing the NFL team that’s playing in his own backyard.</p>
      <p>The Amazon founder — and world’s richest person with a fortune of $109.5 billion — is reportedly interested in acquiring the Seattle Seahawks, whose stadium sits just 1.5 miles away from Amazon’s headquarters.</p>
      <p>The Washington Post, which is owned by Bezos, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/11/14/bezos-interested-seahawks-maybe-nfl-interested-bezos-definitely/">broke the news of his interest late Thursday</a>, citing an anonymous source “familiar with the NFL’s thinking.”</p>
      <p>Bezos purchasing the Seahawks would keep the franchise in the hands of a local tech billionaire. The late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/10/15/microsoft-co-founder-paul-allen-dead-at-65/">who died last year</a>, bought the team in 1997.</p>
      <p>With his staggering fortune, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/11/jeff-bezos-might-be-looking-to-buy-an-nfl-team/">Bezos could pay cash for any available team</a>, which makes him an attractive owner. NFL ownership rules require that buyers put down at least 30 percent of the purchase price in cash.</p>
      <p>Forbes has the Seahawks — who are currently second in the NFC West with an 8-2 record and last won the Super Bowl in 2014 — valued at $2.7 billion.</p>
      <p>Fellow billionaire sports team owner Mark Cuban said in an interview Thursday <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/15/mark-cuban-says-jeff-bezos-would-be-good-addition-to-nfl-owners.html">with CNBC</a> that getting Bezos in the NFL would be “good” for the league, calling him a “special guy.”</p>
      <p>“The NFL could probably use him,” Cuban said. “He’s smart. He’s successful. He’s got a lot of money. Those would be the requirements.”</p>
