      <p>Vodafone, the joint venture partner in the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/aditya-birla-group">Aditya Birla group </a>entity, has categorically said that given the significant capital already invested, it will not inject further group equity into India.</p>
      <p>“When an owner expresses the inability to make further investments, the issue is serious. <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/banks">Banks </a>are analysing implications and awaiting clarity from the secretary panel,” said senior executives with a large public sector bank.</p>
      <p>According to Reserve Bank of India data, commercial banks’ exposure to the telecommunications sector rose to Rs 1.15 trillion in September 2019, from Rs 81,126 crore in September 2017. State Bank of India’s exposure to the industry increased to Rs 35,735 crore as of September 2019, from Rs 25,538 crore a year ago.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/vodafone-idea">Vodafone Idea </a>and <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/bharti-airtel">Bharti Airtel </a>reported a whopping combined loss of close to Rs 74,000 crore in the September 2019 quarter, as the leading telecom operators were hit by statutory dues arising from the recent Supreme Court ruling on AGR.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The issue had been dragging on for the past 14 years, with telecom providers and the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) locked in a battle over the definition of AGR.</p>
      <p>While the telecom service providers insisted that AGR included only revenue from core operations, the DoT maintained that AGR also included revenue from operations other than the core ones.</p>
      <p>AGR assumes significance because it is the basis on which the DoT calculates levies payable by operators. Telecom companies pay 3-5 per cent and 8 per cent of the AGR as spectrum usage charges and license fees, respectively, to the DoT.</p>
