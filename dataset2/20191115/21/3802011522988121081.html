      <p>Taranhike abused the Zinara fuel facility and authorised the issuance of 1 800 litres of petrol (Redan Puma) coupons to ZBC journalist Davison Vandira in April without following due procedures, prejudicing his employer of fuel then worth $6 354.</p>
      <p>Harare regional magistrate Mr Hosea Mujaya initially sentenced Taranhike to 30 months in prison before suspending six months on condition of good behaviour.</p>

      <p>Another nine months were suspended on condition that Taranhike pays back the 1 800 litres of fuel to Zinara before December 31 this year.</p>
      <p>In passing sentence, Mr Mujaya said he took into consideration that Taranhike was a first offender and a family man.</p>
      <p>Mr Mujaya said it was true that Taranhike did not directly benefit from the commission of the offence.</p>
      <p>He further stated that Taranhike lost his job as a result of the offence.</p>
      <p>Mr Mujaya said the court could not turn a blind eye on corrupt activities and should pass an exemplary sentence.</p>
      <p>In mitigation, Taranhike’s lawyer Ms Purity Chikangaise said her client was a first offender and a father of three. She told the court that Taranhike was a qualified chartered accountant.</p>
      <p>Ms Chikangaise told the court that Taranhike was a hypertension patient who takes medication three times a day.</p>
      <p>“Because of this conviction, my client’s employment opportunities have been thrown down the drain,” she said.</p>
      <p>Ms Chikangaise told the court that the conviction on its own had a negative impact on her client in his social life since he was a well-respected person.</p>
      <p>She asked for leniency, saying a custodial sentence would be too harsh for a first offender.</p>
      <p>“The court should consider a fine in this matter because indeed it is a fine-able offence, especially putting all the circumstances of the case in total,” she said.</p>
      <p>Asked by Mr Mujaya whether it was appropriate to consider restitution as part of the sentence, Ms Chikangaise agreed saying her client was in a position to restitute the fuel coupons if need be.</p>
      <p>In aggravation, prosecutor Ms Netsai Mushayabasa said corruption has become rampant in the country and the court should consider stern measures to send a message to would-be offenders.</p>
      <p>Ms Mushayabasa said a fine or community service would trivialise the offence. <b>The Herald</b></p>
