      <h1>Meek Mill Lists the Top Five Rappers of His Era</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T21:11:53+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 21:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xxlmag.com/author/trentfitzgerald/" target="_blank">Trent Fitzgerald</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/tags/meek-mill/">Meek Mill</a> has revealed his list of the top five rappers of his era.</p>
      <p>On Thursday (Nov. 15), the <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/10/meek-mill-covers-xxl-magazine-fall-2018-issue/">Philadelphia rhymer</a> opened up his Twitter account to an #askmeek session where fans can ask him anything and everything on the social media platform. When a fan asked him who is his top five rappers right now, Meek revealed his picks starting with Jay-Z, his <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/01/jay-z-meek-mill-criminal-justice-reform-organization/">ally in criminal justice reform</a>.</p>
      <p>In the tweet, Meek wrote, "Hov... Wayne...Rozay .... kiss .... Dmx .... and that’s my era top 5!!!"</p>
      <p>As you can see, Meek included Hov,  <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/tags/lil-wayne/">Lil Wayne</a>, <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/tags/rick-ross/">Rick Ross</a>, <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/tags/jadakiss/">Jadakiss</a> and <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/tags/dmx/">DMX</a>.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Meek responded to a fan's question about the p<a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/11/meek-mill-new-album-2019-hint/">ossibility of him releasing a new project before the end of the year</a>. "I'ma set this shit straight just to be in the convo of the 2019 albums," the <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/07/meek-mill-dream-chasers-jay-z-roc-nation/">Dreamchasers mogul</a> wrote in a tweet hinting that he might drop an album that could be in one of the year's best album conversations.</p>
      <p>Although Meek is hinting about dropping new material, there is no guarantee that he will deliver a new project this year. <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/08/meek-mill-new-music-summer/">Back in August</a>, the 32-year-old artist promised to release a pack of music before the end of the summer. However, his promise didn't come to fruition.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, during his #askmeek session, when a fan asked him what his favorite song is from his music catalog, Meek gave the obvious answer. “Of course intro,” he wrote in a tweet, referring to his classic "Dreams and Nightmares (Intro)" from his 2012 album, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dreams-Nightmares-Deluxe-Explicit-Meek/dp/B009QPLHT8?SubscriptionId=AKIAJYPOGEBYCEUS42SQ&amp;tag=xxlmagtsm-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=B009QPLHT8"><i>Dreams and Nightmares</i></a>.</p>

      <h3>"Intro," Jay-Z</h3>
      <p><i>The Dynasty: Roc La Familia</i> (2000)</p>
      <p>It’s an event. It’s a championship in the making. But not just one. Two, three, four, more. It’s a damn dynasty. Such is the atmosphere imagined by Just Blaze’s clean, hard soul/rock production on Jigga’s crew-crashing LP that kicks the millennium off proper. Of course, quotables like “This is food for thought, you do the dishes” on Jay’s one long verse serve as the perfect amuse bouche for the feast in the kitchen.</p>

      <h3>“WWIII,” Ruff Ryders Featuring Swizz Beatz, Snoop Dogg, Yung Wun, Scarface and Jadakiss</h3>
      <p><i>Ryde or Die Vol. II</i> (2000)</p>
      <p>The ominous synths and cataclysmic song title warn of the imminent demolition. Stars from the East, West and South align as the Ruff Ryders launch their second compilation with a nuclear assault. Simply getting Snoop, ’Face and Jada all on a track is a win. That they all bring their A-game is historic.</p>

      <h3>“Experience Dedication,” Reflection Eternal</h3>
      <p><i>Train of Thought</i> (2000)</p>
      <p>Beginning your first album with a shoutout from Nelson Mandela as impersonated by Dave Chappelle is unconventional, to say the least. But it grabs our attention. So as Talib Kweli gets his thank-yous out of the way early over a Hi-Tek neck-snapper, asking, “Are you ready?” and calling for raised fists, anticipation bubbles for just the right amount of time before the duo launches into the rattling “Move Somethin’.” It’s like the measurement that precedes the chainsaw.</p>

      <h3>“Intro,” Clipse</h3>
      <p><i>Lord Willin’</i> (2002)</p>
      <p>Ahhh… remember the days when The Neptunes produced an entire front-to-back rap record? When Malice had some? Over a simple drums-and-vibes track—no chorus, no singing, no frills—the brothers Thornton each snatch the microphone and introduce themselves as a force to be reckoned with. First, Pusha “speaks with crooked tongue,” then Malice states, “I’m the reason your favorite MC is no longer your favorite.” The duo proceeds to carry that edge over 12 more stripped-down tracks and establish themselves as one of the best crews in the game.</p>

      <h3>“Doo Rags,” Nas</h3>
      <p><i>The Lost Tapes</i> (2002)</p>
      <p>The jazzy ease-in to Nasir’s collection of uncovered scrolls paints a picture of back-in-the-day Queensbridge, when a future superstar was still finding his path and puffing enjoyment from a spliff. “Doo Rags” is a wiser man looking back fondly on those naïve nights and formative years. The track suggests a collection of thoughtful excursions, of meandering over menace.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>“Get Down,” Nas</h3>
      <p><i>God’s Son</i> (2002)</p>
      <p><i>God’s Son</i> features two of the greatest singles of Nas’s later-career in “Made You Look” and “I Can,” but it’s the first voice you hear when you slide in the CD that informs you this is a non- nonsense record: James Brown. “Get down!” Sampling none other than “The Payback,” co- producers Nas and Salaam Remi bring our hero back to the essence. Gritty break beats, HD storytelling and bulletproof project-window bars. We’re thrown back in time, yet it feels so timeless—and nasty.</p>

      <h3>“Trap Muzik,” T.I. Featuring Mac Boney</h3>
      <p><i>Trap Muzik</i> (2003)</p>
      <p>There is no mistaking what the song, the album or the artist is about, as Tip makes his intentions crystal clear on the sophomore-slump-busting into to album No. 2. When he’s not riding DJ Toomp’s Southern bump with trademark effortlessness, T.I. is hopping fences running from the cops. There is an urgency here, a danger, but also a sense of pride and determination.</p>

      <h3>“The Illest Villains," Madvillian</h3>
      <p><i>Madvillainy</i> (2004)</p>
      <p>The ideal intro doesn’t necessarily require punchlines and flows. Sometimes a simple mood- setter does the trick, which is what the super-weirdo duo of Madlib and MF Doom accomplish with the opening of their acclaimed full-length collaboration. It’s the only track co-produced by the artists. Madlib’s erie strings conjure a dastardly comic-book layer, while Doom’s vintage voice skits quickly build a mythology for the creatives’ latest alter-ego. So when he starts rhyming non sequiturs over an accordion, it feels oddly in place.</p>

      <h3>“Be (Intro),” Common</h3>
      <p><i>Be</i> (2005)</p>
      <p>Common’s renaissance album—<i>Be</i> received this magazine’s perfect <i>XXL</i> score—begins with a naked, meandering bass line before finding its groove. Then, gradually, piece by piece, come the keys, synths and drums. Once the beat is fully constructed, the Chicago MC kicks in the door like a wind gust, touching on artistic legends, family, materialism and spirituality while spilling toss-away nuggets—“Drunk nights get remembered more than sober ones”—in a single tornado verse. All this in under 150 seconds. Cool, but deadly.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>“Tha Mobb,” Lil Wayne</h3>
      <p><i>Tha Carter II</i> (2005)</p>
      <p>Breaking from the comfort of his Cash Money comfort zone, Weezy employs the Dipset-affiliated Heatmakerz to lay a wall of soul-infused sound for the intro to his second <i>Carter</i> installment. For more than five minutes, the hottest flame-thrower of the moment exercises his verbal chops, giving the impression he could rap till death should he so choose. Spellbinding in its relentlessness and effortlessness.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>“The Prelude,” Jay-Z</h3>
      <p><i>Kingdom Come</i> (2006)</p>
      <p>The album wasn’t spectacular, but the intro was. Over a B-Money beat that invokes 1970s pimp-strutting, Jay-Z—“a hustler disguised as a rapper”—casually spills game, feelin’ himself, his come-up, his legacy, his bank account. Whether Jay’s post–<i>Black Album</i> retirement was ever meant to stick or was always a gimmick feels irrelevant. The good news is there were barrels more dope raps (check the 38 wordplay) left in the man still.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>“Good Morning,” Kanye West</h3>
      <p><i>Graduation</i> (2007)</p>
      <p>Like its author, there exists both a darkness and a lightness to “Good Morning.” <i>Graduation</i>’s valedictorian speech, blessed by hard drums and an airy Elton John sample, is at once celebratory and suspicious, nicely encapsulating both the ambition and susceptibility of a man who describes himself like this: “I’m like a fly Malcolm X—buy any jeans necessary.”</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>“3 Peat,” Lil Wayne</h3>
      <p><i>Tha Carter III</i> (2008)</p>
      <p>Weezy sounds just as amped up for the third installment of his Carter series as we were in 2008. Storming out thirsty and wild and profane, Wayne dives in headfirst over a Maestro composition without checking for rocks, delivering “a million uppercuts” in one extended, chorus-free verse. “Swallow my words” rings more like a demand than a request.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>“No Church in the Wild,” Jay-Z &amp; Kanye West Featuring Frank Ocean</h3>
      <p><i>Watch the Throne</i> (2011)</p>
      <p>The seventh and final single released off Jay and Ye’s event collabo LP, “No Church in the Wild” prowls in like a wild-game hunt as Frank Ocean’s dour vocals color a mangled electric guitar. The thing feels very manic. A cocktail of spirits and sin has Jay-Z questioning religion and Thanksgiving and Kanye flashing back to last night’s drunken exploit with a girl in all leopard. The-Dream’s uncredited Auto-Tune and a late invasion of howler monkeys only add to the unpredictability here.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>“Dreams and Nightmares,” Meek Mill</h3>
      <p><i>Dreams and Nightmares</i> (2012)</p>
      <p>“Ain’t this what they been waitin’ for? You ready?” teases the Philly wordsmith, before spitting nearly four straight minutes of fire. First, producer The Beat Bully lets Meek tear into a sparse piano line before bringing the beat—and the ruckus—all the way in. Mill spazzes out on the track, instantly raising the bar for himself and the competition. This chest-puffing album intro alone has well over 40 million plays on YouTube.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>“Sherane a.k.a. Master Splinter’s Daughter,” Kendrick Lamar</h3>
      <p><i>good kid, m.A.A.d city</i> (2012)</p>
      <p>Everything about Kung-fu Kenny’s Aftermath debut intro forewarns listeners that they are in for something serious, something different, something expert. Lamar begins his autobiographical opus with a story rap from his youth and ends the track with a phone-call skit. No hooks. No boasts. We’re immediately thrust into a narrative with real-life characters. There’s lust and deceit and distrust, and we’re dying to know more about his world.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>“Tuscan Leather,” Drake</h3>
      <p><i>Nothing Was the Same</i> (2013)</p>
      <p>Never released as a single, “Tuscan Leather” still rose as high as No. 23 on Billboard—another example of Drake’s decade of dominance. “This is nothin’ for the radio, but they’ll still play it though,” Drizzy brags over 40’s chopped-up Whitney Houston sample, his confidence swelling. He’s in spitter mode, giving a three-verse, state-of-the-union address that tackles his strained relationship with Nicki Minaj. The beat shifts drastically a couple of times, adding a spontaneity and excitement to this curtain opening. But don’t get it twisted: It’s all calculated. “How much time is this nigga spendin’ on the intro?”</p>

      <h3>“Givenchy,” Young Thug Featuring Birdman</h3>
      <p><i>Rich Gang: Tha Tour Pt. 1</i> (2014)</p>
      <p>Thugga establishes himself as one of hip-hop’s most hypnotizing, joyful and quirky characters on this crew mixtape-as-album. Sure, Birdman and Rich Homie Quan also play a role in the project, but Track 1 drills home the fact this is Young Thug’s show(case). His yelps and his warbles, his melodies and his oddball cadence shifts all assert Thug’s position as a rising star, a talent equally unique and unpredictable.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>“Jeopardy,” Run the Jewels</h3>
      <p><i>Run the Jewels 2</i> (2014)</p>
      <p>The break-your-neck, assassinate-your-president ethos of Killer Mike and El-P’s second act is wonderfully, aggressively encapsulated early on the super duo’s second and best LP. Over a haunting El-Producto wash of terror and drunken brass, Mikey goes for broke, sounding more confident and focused as ever. El-P’s second verse comes in like lamb, at first self-deprecating, then swells into a lion: “Run the Jewels is the answer/ The question is, ‘What’s poppin’?’ ” No way you’re not giving Track 2 a chance after this.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>“Ultralight Beam,” Kanye West</h3>
      <p><i>Life of Pablo</i> (2016)</p>
      <p>This is a God dream. This is everything. This is Kanye West at his most egotistical and ambitious and collaborative, with church choirs and a diversified team of super talents—Chance the Rapper, Kirk Franklin, Rick Rubin, Mike Dean, Swizz Beatz, Plain Pat, Kelly Price—rushing to support his vision. This is only Track One, and we’re strapped in, ready to ride to places wonderful and awful but never boring.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>“All We Got,” Chance the Rapper</h3>
      <p><i>Coloring Book</i> (2016)</p>
      <p>Kanye West has passed on his golden touch for Track 1s to fellow Chicagoan Chance, and the two team-up for arguably the two best rap intros of 2016. “All We Got” starts with a trumpet, then Chance’s whisper-chant of “we back… we back… we back,” before denying that the thing is an intro at all. “This the entrée!” Kanye adds flourish but doesn’t crash the stage, letting the gospel choir rise up and a single message ring through: "Music is all we got."</p>

      <h3>“The Space Program,” A Tribe Called Quest</h3>
      <p><i>We Got It from Here… Thank You 4 Your Service</i> (2016)</p>
      <p>After an 18-year hiatus from the album game and with a key member recently deceased, it was with great trepidation that followers pressed play on a new ATCQ record. So hearing Q-Tip and Phife Dawg’s voices intertwining off top put us at ease. “It's time to go left and not right/Gotta get it together forever/Gotta get it together for brothers/Gotta get it together for sisters/For mothers and fathers and dead niggas…” The self-produced beat feels both familiar and fresh, Phife’s death is immediately acknowledged, and Tip’s verses are fire. They resurrected so they could vanish in peace, and we’re grateful.</p>

      <h3>“Get Up 10,” Cardi B</h3>
      <p><i>Invasion of Privacy</i> (2018)</p>
      <p>It takes Cardi all of two bars to tackle her stripper past head-on and establish herself as something more than that “Bodak Yellow” chick. Cardi got bars for days, and “Get Up 10” gets the skills flexing out of the way early, so when <i>Privacy</i>’s more radio-friendly fare hits, you’d be foolish to question her bona fides. There is a fierce paranoia at play as Cardi outlines her rags-to-riches, fuelled-by-haters mythology, and a defiant edge softened only by wit. “Real bitch,” she blurts. “Only thing fake is the boobs.”</p>

      <h3>“If You Know You Know,” Pusha-T</h3>
      <p><i>Daytona</i> (2018)</p>
      <p>The potential for a seven-track classic is laid out when Pusha starts popping that game, as per tradition on his album openers. Whip-smart and precise, the unapologetic corner boy keeps finding fresh avenues to cruise through the same territory, mining from a bottomless well of coke metaphors (“I predict snow, Al Roker”), and Kanye West’s production gives a sharp bop. There is a clean precision here that will run throughout the no-filler LP.</p>

      <h3>“Under the Sun,” Dreamville Featuring J. Cole, Lute and DaBaby</h3>
      <p><i>Revenge of the Dreamers III</i> (2019)</p>
      <p>You know a joint is fire when Kendrick Lamar wanders into the studio just to listen and ends up lending his vocals to the hook uncredited—“I woke up for some moooonnayyy!”—just because. Producers Christo, Pluss and Nice Rec assemble a breezy soul sample that propels the track but never detracts from a triple dose of verses that establishes <i>Revenge of the Dreamers</i>’ all-hands-on-deck communal approach to record-making. Relative newbies Lute (“Potato over my gun/I move in silence 'cause niggas be clocking my funds”) and DaBaby (“I just put diamonds on all of my teeth, now they probably think I ain't intelligent”) hang right there with Cole.</p>
