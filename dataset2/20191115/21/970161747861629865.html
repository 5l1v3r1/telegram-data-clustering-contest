      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/justin-bieber/">Justin Bieber</a> has broken his silence <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/taylor-swift-reignites-scooter-braun-feud-encourages-fans-go-manager-claims-blocked-performing-songs-11148397/">over Taylor Swift’s feud with Scooter Braun and Scott Borchetta</a> – appearing to show his support to his manager.</p>
      <p>Things kicked off when the Shake It Off singer accused the pair, as well as Big Machine Records, of blocking her from performing her songs – ahead of her appearance at the American Music Awards – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/big-machine-records-denies-taylor-swift-music-ban-claims-11163830/">something BMR fiercely denied</a> in a strongly-worded statement.</p>
      <p>But, while a string of famous faces have publicly stood with the 29-year-old in the drama, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/selena-gomez-fumes-scooter-brauns-manipulation-taylor-swift-emotional-statement-11163227/">including Lily Allen, Selena Gomez and Halsey</a>, Justin seems to have gone the other way.</p>
      <p>In fact, the 25-year-old shared a screenshot on his Instagram story, showing an article from TMZ which stated Taylor was ‘free to play all her hits’ at the upcoming ceremony.</p>
      <p>In the upload, a Big Machine executive told the publication: ‘Taylor Swift can 100% perform all of her catalogue, past and present, on the AMAs.</p>

      <p>‘Our confusion with her statement is that we have no legal right to stop this and have never tried.</p>
      <p>‘She and her team both know this.’</p>

      <p>Justin added no further comment on his Instagram antics.</p>
      <p>His post comes after Taylor’s publicist Tree Paine shared a statement on Twitter earlier on Friday, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/taylor-swifts-team-seemingly-catch-scooter-braun-big-machine-records-shock-email-expose-11164427/">claiming Big Machine Records used clever wording to try and hide their actions</a> over her live performances – and an upcoming Netflix documentary – as seen in a private email.</p>
      <p>It read: ‘The truth is, on October 28, 2019 at 5:17 p.m. the Vice President, Rights Management and Business Affairs from Big Machine Label Group sent Taylor Swift‘s team the following: “Please be advised that BMLG will not agree to issue licenses for existing recordings or waivers of its re-recording restrictions in connection with these two projects: The Netflix documentary and The Alibaba ‘Double Eleven’ event.”</p>
      <p>‘To avoid an argument over rights, Taylor performed three songs off her new album Lover at the Double Eleven events as it was clear that Big Machine Label Group felt any televised performance of catalogue songs violated her agreement.’</p>

      <p>She then added that BMR has specifically blocked Taylor from her project with Netflix and her American Music Awards performance, stating: ‘In addition, yesterday Scott Borchetta, CEO and founder of Big Machine Label Group, flatly denied the request for both American Music Awards and Netflix.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘Please notice in Big Machine’s statement, they never actually deny either claim Taylor said last night in her post.’</p>
      <p>Nowhere in the BMR statement does it explicitly state that the company hasn’t denied Taylor’s request to perform her old songs at the AMAs or use her back catalogue of material for her Netflix documentary.</p>
      <p>While a string of celebrities around the world have praised Taylor for standing strong, fans are upset that some of those closest to the 22 singer have kept quiet.</p>
      <p>And some have branded <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/shawn-mendes-branded-coward-taylor-swift-fans-stays-silent-scooter-braun-row-11163783/">Shawn Mendes a ‘coward’</a> over his silence.</p>
