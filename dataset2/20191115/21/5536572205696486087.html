      <h1>Grown Man Cries On Air While Discussing Myles Garrett Hitting Mason Rudolph With A Helmet (VIDEO)</h1>

      <p>Cleveland Browns defensive lineman lost his mind last night when he let his rage get the best of him by removing Mason Rudolph’s helmet and whacking him over the head with it.</p>
      <p>That moment led to a brawl that would get him suspended for the remainder of the season and Steelers’ Pouncey suspended for 3 games for hitting and kicking Garrett.</p>
      <p>That decision not only affected the Browns and their fan base, but one particular guy who had no dog in the fight.</p>
      <p>One guy called into the Boomer and Gio show to speak on the Garrett-Rudolph brawl and it had him very emotional to the point he was crying throughout.</p>

      <p>I get being shocked about the amount of violence that was displayed, but to have that moment get you to the point of tears is quite ridiculous.</p>
      <p>Myles has since been suspended for the year and the playoffs, while Rudolph might catch a fine for his actions.</p>
