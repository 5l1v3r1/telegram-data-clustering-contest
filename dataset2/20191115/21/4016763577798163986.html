      <h1>A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie Explains The “Genuine” Chemistry He Shares With Lil Uzi Vert</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T21:46:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 21:46</time> by <a rel="author">Caitlin Kelley</a></address>
      <p>Ahead of his third album, <a href="https://genius.com/artists/a-boogie-wit-da-hoodie">A Boogie wit da Hoodie</a> just dropped his latest single, <a href="https://genius.com/A-boogie-wit-da-hoodie-reply-lyrics">“Reply,”</a> with his friend and frequent collaborator <a href="https://genius.com/artists/lil-uzi-vert">Lil Uzi Vert</a>.</p>
      <p>Produced by <a href="https://genius.com/artists/joefromyo">JoeFromYO</a> and <a href="https://genius.com/artists/go-grizzly">Go Grizzly</a>, the track centers on a communication breakdown with a love interest, as Uzi opens the song:</p>
      <blockquote>Follow my commands, come on, girl, comply<br/>You only want me ‘cause my life’s televised<br/>And I can see all them lies in your eyes<br/>But I’m no different, selling dreams for tonight<br/>Just so I could have my way, rubbin’ on your thighs<br/>In the morning, go back home because I do not have no ties</blockquote>
      <p>A Boogie follows that up with an offer to play-act as the type of guy his girl wants:</p>
      <blockquote>If I write you, girl, tell me, would you reply? (Would you reply?)<br/>You know I used to be a thief up in the night (Yeah, yeah)<br/>And you don’t want that type of guy in your life<br/>But what if I put on a disguise for the night? (Yeah, yeah)<br/>What if I was to put my life up on the line? (On the line)</blockquote>
      <p>The Bronx MC recently spoke to <i><a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8528674/a-boogie-interview-audiomack">Billboard</a></i> about recording tracks with Uzi. “We just made another joint the other day,” he said. “Some fire shit the other day. I think it was yesterday, actually.”</p>
      <p>Back in July, he told <i><a href="https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/a-boogie-wit-da-hoodie-hasnt-stretched-or-slept-in-three-days">Interview Magazine</a></i> about working with the Philly rapper. “Me and Uzi just did 10 songs in the studio,” he said. “We didn’t like five of them, but then it was an eye-opener at the end of the day. It was our first time really chopping it up. We go to the same studio and have the same engineer. He was making his album. I was making my album right there, also.”</p>
      <p>During the <i>Billboard</i> interview, he elaborated on the chemistry that the two artists share. “It’s that real genuine shit when you link up with an artist,” he said. “Fuck the cameras. When it’s off-cameras, that’s when it’s real. You don’t gotta see the love on video. This shit is real life. This shit we talking about is our real thoughts and shit. We be talking about shit that we go through.”</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in the interview, he talked about how he is applying his DIY approach to his next album. “<a href="https://genius.com/artists/chris-brown">Chris Brown</a> made me want to start doing everything,” he said. “I started producing. Half of my album right now, <i><a href="https://genius.com/albums/A-boogie-wit-da-hoodie/Artist-2-0">Artist 2.0</a></i>, is produced by me. This shit is going to be directed by me with the videos, every video.”</p>
      <p>A Boogie’s last full-length, <i><a href="https://genius.com/albums/A-boogie-wit-da-hoodie/Hoodie-szn">Hoodie SZN</a></i>, hit the top of the Billboard 200 earlier this year. He <a href="https://genius.com/a/a-boogie-wit-da-hoodie-wants-to-take-time-away-from-music-after-his-next-album">recently posted</a> about taking a break after his <i>Artist 2.0</i> era ends: “This might be my last project for a while I wanna take a break from music after <i>Artist 2.0</i> tour is over.”</p>
