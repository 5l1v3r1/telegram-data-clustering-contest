      <p>Officers responded on Nov. 8 around 8:50 a.m. to an alley behind the 400 block of Fifth Avenue North, following a report of “an unknown problem,” according to Saskatoon police. Upon arrival, officers quickly recognized the gravity of the discovery.</p>
      <p>Police, in a brief update earlier this week, said investigators “are continuing to gather evidence and conduct interviews in an effort to identify and locate the mother of the infant,” adding that the immediate priority “is to assist in providing the supports needed to the woman involved.”</p>
      <p>Police on Friday again stressed the “urgent need to locate the mother.”</p>
      <p>As part of the investigation, police are still seeking video surveillance from between 25th Street and Queen Street and Third and Sixth Avenues — specifically between Nov. 4 and 8. Investigators also released a stock image of the “very distinct” Scentsy bag in which the baby was located, hoping a member of the public would recognize it.</p>

      <p>Around <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/community-gathers-to-mourn-dead-infant-found-in-downtown-alley">three dozen community members held a vigil Saturday night</a> in the alley where the baby had been found.</p>
      <p>Jonathan Mercredi, <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/police-presence-in-400-block-of-fifth-avenue-north">who lives in one of the condo buildings overlooking the alley, said he was taking out his trash</a> when a person who had been searching for recyclables in a recycling bin called him over. There was a bag inside the bin with what appeared to be a lifeless baby girl.</p>
      <p>“I still have the image in my mind,” Mercredi said on Nov. 8. “I don’t think I can ever forget it.”</p>
