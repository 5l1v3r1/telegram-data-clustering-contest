      <p>Let’s take a more in-depth look at the most recent Eros earnings report.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Diluted losses per share are a switch from diluted earnings per share in the same period of the year prior.</li>
        <li>Revenue is sitting 38.97% lower than $63.43 million in the fiscal second quarter of 2019.</li>
        <li>Eros earnings see the company report an operating loss instead of operating income for the same time last year.</li>
        <li>The same is also true as the company reported a net loss instead of net income in the current quarter.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Eros includes the following statement with its earnings report for the fiscal second quarter of 2020.</p>
      <blockquote>“As of September 30, 2019 our Eros Now OTT platform reached 23.5 million paid monthly subscribers and 177.7 million registered users, increases of 81% and 39%, respectively, over the same period last year. This represents net additions of 4.7 million paid subscribers and 23 million registered users during the first half of Fiscal Year 2020.”</blockquote>
      <p>The Eros earnings report also has it reiterating its outlook for fiscal 2020. That includes revenue ranging from $200 million to $220 million. That still gives it a good chance of beating Wall Street’s revenue estimate of $200.95 million for the period.</p>
      <p>EROS stock closed out the day up 11.52% Friday and is up nearly 1% in after-hours trading.</p>
