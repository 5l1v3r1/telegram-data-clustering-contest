      <h1>Pain gets the better of Oosthuizen as he hangs tough at Sun City</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T21:01:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 21:01</time> by <a rel="author">Lynn Butler - Sport24</a></address>
      <p>Sun City - <b>Louis Oosthuizen</b> said fatigue got the better of him in the second round at the <b>Nedbank Golf Challenge</b> on Friday.</p>
      <p>The 2010 Open champion spent Wednesday at a hospital in Rustenburg treating a kidney stone, which almost resulted in him not teeing off in the opening round on Thursday.</p>
      <p>However, Oosthuizen bounced back to take the overnight lead by three shots heading into Round 2.</p>
      <p>On Friday, the Gary Player Country Club was not his friend this time around as Oosthuizen posted a level par round of 72 to remain on 9-under - two shots behind <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Golf/NedbankChallenge/lombard-wins-sa-fans-over-to-take-sun-city-lead-20191115">leader and fellow countryman Zander Lombard</a>.</p>
      <p>"I was fine starting, the last six holes got me a bit. The tee shot at the 14th, I felt pain in the right lower side and the next two holes, I was thinking about that and I didn't really focus on what I had to do," Oosthuizen told reporters on Friday.</p>
      <p>"I could feel that I wasn't on song with the way I was hitting it. It's fatigue, I need to rest well for tomorrow."</p>
      <p>Only one golfer managed to hit a bogey-free second round - Malaysian's Gavin Green - who shot a 2-under 70.</p>
      <p>Oosthuizen said it was tough day and was bound to get tougher heading into the weekend.</p>
      <p>"It was tough... it was guessing the whole day so it was difficult around this golf course. Other than Zander's round, I don't think there's low rounds out there," said SA's top ranked golfer.</p>
      <p>"Hopefully this was my bad one for the week but I think the golf course is going to play really tough on the weekend.</p>
      <p>"You could see the sort of pins and I think on the weekend we're going to have a proper test."</p>
      <p>Oosthuizen will tee off alongside Belgian Thomas Detry and leader Zander Lombard at <b>10:20</b> on Saturday.</p>
