      <p>PHOENIX (AP) — Wildlife officials say an endangered squirrel subspecies in southeastern Arizona is fighting its way back after much of its mountain habitat was burned by a 2017 wildfire.</p>
      <p>The Arizona Game and Fish Department says the Mount Graham red squirrel’s population is stabilizing, with a 4% increase recorded in September during an annual survey that produced an estimate of 78 squirrels, up from 75 in 2018.</p>
      <p>According to the department, the population peaked at about 550 in the late 1990s. Before the 2017 wildfire, the population ranged between 200 and 300.</p>
      <p>Terrestrial wildlife specialist Tim Snow says the results are encouraging though much work remains to help protect the squirrel population.</p>
      <p>The squirrel is found only in upper elevation conifer forests of the Pinaleño Mountains.</p>
