      <p>North Las Vegas police have identified a suspect in the fatal shooting last month of another man <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/north-las-vegas/man-shot-killed-while-in-moving-car-in-north-las-vegas-1872999/">after an apparent botched drug </a><a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/north-las-vegas/man-shot-killed-while-in-moving-car-in-north-las-vegas-1872999/">deal</a>.</p>
      <p>Michael Jerome Anderson Jr., 21, was arrested Nov. 7 on charges of open murder, discharging a gun within a vehicle and discharging a gun into an occupied vehicle, according to jail and court records. Denied bail, he remains in custody at the Clark County Detention Center.</p>
      <p>The victim, <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/crime/homicides/drug-deal-preceded-fatal-shooting-in-north-las-vegas-police-say-1873661/">28-year-old Corey Donte Jones</a> of Las Vegas, died Oct. 17 of a gunshot wound to his chest. Police have said that Jones was in the passenger seat of a car driving near West Alexander Road and Revere Street when gunfire struck the right side of the vehicle.</p>
      <p>The driver, who was uninjured, called 911 for help, and Jones was taken to University Medical Center, where he died that afternoon, police said.</p>
      <p>Further details have not been released, including how detectives identified Anderson as the suspect, but city police spokesman Eric Leavitt previously said that “it was a narcotics deal turned bad.”</p>
      <p>Anderson was expected in North Las Vegas Justice Court for a status hearing in the case on Monday morning, court records show.</p>
