      <h1>A Star Wars Stormtrooper is Now Available in Fortnite</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T21:25:45+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 21:25</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Workman</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/fortnite"><b>Fortnite</b></a> has seen a lot of crossovers over the past couple of years, from <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/avengers-endgame"><b>Avengers</b></a> to <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/video-games/466863-the-batman-and-fortnite-crossover-has-officially-arrived"><b>Batman</b></a> to <b>John Wick</b>. But now it’s taking the holiday season by Force, with a little help from <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/star-wars"><b>Star Wars</b></a>. Epic Games has introduced a new promotion for its hit Battle Royale game that ties in with the just-released <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order"><b>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</b></a>. Players can now suit up as an Imperial Stormtrooper from the game.</p>
      <p>The trailer below highlights what’s in store for those that pick up the Stormtrooper skin, complete with an appearance by a Star Destroyer. This could potentially lead to <b>Star Wars</b> events in the future. We wouldn’t be shocked if there’s <b>Fortnite</b> a tie-in with <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker"><b>The Rise of Skywalker</b></a>. </p>

      <p>Players can pick up the Stormtrooper skin in two different ways. The first is by visiting the in-game shop and spending 1,500 V-Bucks (in game currency) to add it to their collection. The other is by visiting the <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order/stormtrooper-outfit-faq">Epic Games Store</a> and purchasing either version of <b>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</b> for PC. Once confirmed, the Stormtrooper skin will join their wardrobe collection.</p>
      <p>The publisher noted that the Stormtrooper availability will be “from time to time” through the shop. So anyone who wants to be counted among the Empire should probably grab it now. Just make sure to work on those aiming skills — it’s hard to tell how effective a Stormtrooper’s aim can be.</p>
      <p><b>Fortnite</b> is available now for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, PC and mobile devices.</p>
