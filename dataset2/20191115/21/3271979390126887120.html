      <p><b>Meghan Markle</b> and Prince Harry’s living situation is often the subject of false tabloid stories. One of the most popular narratives is about the couple leaving the U.K. and moving to Malibu. <b>Gossip Cop</b> has debunked this story multiple times, and below are just a few examples.</p>
      <p>The premise goes back to even before the couple got married. In April 2018, a month before their wedding, <i>New Idea</i> claimed <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/prince-harry-meghan-markle-malibu-beach-house/">Prince Harry and Markle bought a Mailbu beach house</a>. The article said the two wanted to split time between England and Los Angeles, where the former actress grew up. The tabloid’s story included details like how many bedrooms the house had, and their plans for renovations to include “tons of space for entertaining.”</p>
      <p>The ridiculous story was not covered by any legitimate news outlet, including multiple publications dedicated solely to the Los Angeles-area real estate market. That’s because it wasn’t true. <b>Gossip Cop</b> check with a royal staffer, who told us the report was completely false.</p>
      <p>Just a few weeks later, <i>Star</i>, which must have been inspired by the <i>New Idea</i> tall tale, spun a false yarn of its own when it asserted <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/prince-harry-meghan-markle-moving-malibu/">Prince Harry and Markle were moving to Malibu</a>. In this version of the phony narrative, the tabloid said Prince Harry was “ready to make a major purchase and plunk down $16 million on a destination holiday home in Malibu for his new bride,” according to what the tabloid claimed were “real estate insiders.”</p>
      <p>The story used some of the same language as the previous report, describing the house Prince Harry wanted to buy – which had the same number of bedrooms as the house <i>New Idea</i> claimed the Duke and Duchess of Sussex had already purchased weeks before. <b>Gossip Cop</b> debunked the story by explaining why the Markle was required to live in the U.K. for extended periods of time as she goes through the citizenship process. That hasn’t changed, by the way, as the duchess is still working through the process.</p>
      <p>This was also true in June 2018, less than a month after the royal wedding, when <i>Grazia</i> ran a piece alleging <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/meghan-markle-malibu-home/">Markle was buying a home in Malibu</a>. <b>Gossip Cop</b> pointed out this was a slight shift in the baseless narrative with the outlet claiming Markle was the shopper, not her husband, but one thing was the same, it was all bogus.</p>
      <p>Most recently, <i>New Idea</i>, <i>Heat</i> and <i>Grazia</i> all falsely reported <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/meghan-markle-prince-harry-malibu-home-millions/">Markle and Prince Harry were buying a $14 million dollar home in Malibu</a>. <b>Gossip Cop</b> investigated the pictures of the couple’s supposed purchase and discovered where all three tabloids found them. The photos came from a house in Point Dume that was still on the market, contrary to the publications’ claims. In fact, it’s still on the market today. The duke and duchess never purchased the house. We’ll conclude by noting that Markle and Prince Harry plan to visit Los Angeles to visit her mom this Thanksgiving. However, they’re certainly not moving to Malibu.</p>
