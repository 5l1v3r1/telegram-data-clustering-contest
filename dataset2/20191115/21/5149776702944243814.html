      <h1>Man who sent 'Jo Cox' threat to MP Anna Soubry is jailed</h1>
      <h2>"It must be a mark of just how serious the judge took the matter."</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T21:44:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 21:44</time> by <a rel="author">Caitlin Doherty, Jamie Barlow</a></address>
      <p>A man who sent a "sickening" letter to MP Anna Soubry, making reference to the murdered MP Jo Cox, has been jailed.</p>
      <p>Ms Soubry was sent the post, which read "COX WAS FIRST YOU ARE NEXT", by Alden Bryce Barlow, 55, of Doncaster.</p>
      <p>The letter arrived at Ms Soubry's constituency office in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/crime">Broxtowe</a> on October 14 this year and was opened by a member of staff, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said.</p>
      <p>Barlow admitted sending a letter conveying a threatening message and was sentenced to 12 months in jail at Sheffield Crown Court.</p>
      <p>He was also given a 10-year restraining order against Ms Soubry, who is standing as a candidate for The Independent Group for Change (TIGfC) in the upcoming General Election.</p>
      <p>Barlow was traced using fingerprint analysis and CCTV from the post office counter in Doncaster where he posted the letter.</p>
      <p>Ms Soubry, leader of the TIGfC, was previously a Conservative and had several ministerial jobs under David Cameron.</p>
      <p>Chief Crown prosecutor Gerry Wareham called the note "sickening" and "ominous", describing it as an "attack on democracy".</p>
      <p>He said: "Ms Soubry and her staff in the constituency office understandably found the message deeply disturbing and highly offensive.</p>
      <p>"I hope the sentence Barlow received today is of some comfort to Ms Soubry and her colleagues and a deterrent to anyone else contemplating such despicable actions against a parliamentary representative or candidate."</p>
      <p>Speaking after the sentencing, Ms Soubry told Nottinghamshire Live: "It is a lengthy prison sentence for that offence and, of course, the guy pleaded guilty.</p>
      <p>"It must be a mark of just how serious the judge took the matter, including the police who have been really, really good and the Crown Prosecution Service.</p>
      <p>"I can't tell you how grateful I am to both <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/long-running-dispute-ends-nottingham-3543526">Nottinghamshire Police</a> and South Yorkshire Police because they acted very quickly.</p>
      <p>"They decided that this man was a risk to me, they arrested him within days. He was remanded in custody."</p>
      <p>She added: "It did frighten me. The people I feel most sorry for are my team because they opened that letter, and they had to read it.</p>
      <p>"It's not just me, it's them. In all of this, whatever your views are, it doesn't matter.</p>
      <p>"In our country we've just got to reset the dial and start to behave in a more decent way to each other and have that good, robust political debate but without making threats to people and abusing people in an unacceptable way."</p>
      <p>Mrs Cox was Labour MP for Batley and Spen when she was stabbed and shot outside a constituency surgery in Birstall, West Yorkshire, in 2016.</p>
      <p>It comes after Nottinghamshire Police said the force was dealing with an unprecedented amount of <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/i-want-boil-your-head-3501912">violent threats made to MPs and members of their families</a>.</p>
