      <p>Rafael Nadal missed out on a blockbuster semi-final with Roger Federer despite roaring to his second comeback win of the week at the ATP Finals.</p>
      <p>Nadal came from a set down to beat Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-7 (4) 6-4 7-5 in a two hour 52-minute marathon at London’s 02.</p>
      <p>But it was not enough to set up a mouthwatering clash between the two great rivals, Nadal’s opening round-robin match defeat by Alexander Zverev ultimately proving his undoing.</p>

      <p>Nevertheless, the 33-year-old got a trophy for his troubles, crowned the year-end world number one, and the eldest man to do it, after Federer’s win over Novak Djokovic meant he could not be caught.</p>
      <p>Nadal, who won the French and US Opens, said: “I think this trophy is the work of the whole year, a great year in all terms. To have this trophy with me is a big personal satisfaction.</p>
      <p>“I think we did a lot of things well during the whole year. Of course the team and the family played a very important role this year, even more than other times because have been some tough moments at the beginning of the season in terms of physical issues that demoralised me a little bit.</p>

      <p>“It’s something difficult, because 11 years since the first time until the fifth is a big number.”</p>
      <p>Those five year-end top-ranked finishes moved Nadal level with the achievements of Djokovic, Federer and Jimmy Connors.</p>

      <p>“I cannot complain, but at some point I feel that there is a couple of years out there that I have been in a position that I had big chances to be the year number one and I got injured, a long injury,” he said.</p>
      <p>“So to have the chance to equal both of them after missing a couple of years through injuries means a lot. It’s a great achievement.”</p>

      <p>Medvedev’s midweek collapse against Nadal, from 5-1 up and with match point in the deciding set, will be one of the enduring memories from the week by the Thames.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old put up a decent showing against Zverev, but the German has designs on retaining his title and ran out a comprehensive 6-4 7-6 (4) winner.</p>
      <p>Zverev will now face Dominic Thiem in Saturday’s second semi-final, after Tsitsipas takes on Federer, who will be bidding for a seventh title.</p>
