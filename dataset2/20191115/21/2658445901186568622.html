      <p>The Ijaw Youths Council (IYC) Central Zone, has called on security agencies to investigate the pre-election violence that rocked Nembe Local Government Area in Bayelsa State and left some persons dead and others injured.</p>
      <p>The Zonal Chairman, Kennedy Olorogun, spoke on Friday during a one-day nonviolent summit, praise and prayer he organised to harp on the need for peace before, during and after the election.</p>
      <p>Olorogun described the shooting and killing in Nembe as barbaric unacceptable and called on security agencies to up their game to forestall recurrence.</p>
      <p>He said persons involved in the incident should be fished out and prosecuted to serve as deterrent to others.</p>
      <p>Olorogun said there was no alternative to peace saying election should not be viewed as war but a democratic contest involving brothers.</p>
      <p>He asked youths to eschew violence and stop allowing themselves to be used by politicians to disrupt the peace in the state.</p>
      <p>Olorogun said: “We condemn in the strongest of terms the devilish act in Nembe that led to the death of so some youths with many people wounded.</p>
      <p>“The IYC leadership also call on INEC and Security agencies to exhibit the characters of civility and neutrality to ensure the election is peaceful, transparent, credible, free and fair”.</p>

      <p>In their various remarks, the Commissioner for Youths, Ebipatei Apaingolo and IYC National Secretary, Alfred Kemepado called on youths to stay away from violence during the poll.</p>
      <p>Kemepado particularly told the youths that IYC had not and would not endorse any candidate for the election.</p>
      <p>He, however, said members were free to support and vote for any candidate of their choice.</p>
      <p>“Any purported endorsement is a crime to Ijaw nation. I urge the clan chairmen and IYC members to go down to their communities to exercise their civic responsibility of voting and I appeal to security agencies to be professional in discharging their duties and not to compromise the process”.</p>
