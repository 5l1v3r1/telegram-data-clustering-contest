      <h3>One of the world’s largest mining companies is exercising its right to buy a majority stake in a proposed diamond mine east of Prince Albert for $75 million, years before it had to make a final decision on the project.</h3>
      <p>Saskatoon-based Star Diamond Corp. said Friday that Rio Tinto Exploration Canada Inc. sent notice that it plans to acquire a 60 per cent share in the site as outlined in an option agreement <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/rio-tinto-eyes-shore-gold-diamond-project-east-of-prince-albert">signed in the summer of 2017</a>.</p>
      <p>The Anglo-Australian mining giant’s decision comes well before the end of the seven-and-a-half-year deal, and just over a year after the Saskatchewan government <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/government-grants-environmental-approval-for-prince-albert-area-diamond-mine">gave the proposed mine environmental approval</a>.</p>
      <p>The announcement sent Star Diamond’s share price rocketing up to $0.26, its highest point in more than six months.</p>
      <p>“I think this clearly shows the quality of the project in the heart of Saskatchewan. It’s exciting,” Star Diamond President and CEO Ken MacNeill said in a brief telephone interview Friday morning.</p>
      <p>Rio Tinto is expected to continue taking samples and assembling a sample processing plant at the site 50 kilometres east of Prince Albert before, at some point in the future, deciding whether to take the project to a pre-feasibility study phase.</p>
      <p>While the company’s commitment does not signal its intention to bring the project into production, a New York-based diamond industry analyst said Rio Tinto’s decision signals that is a “very, very realistic possibility.”</p>
      <p>“It seems like they’re very enthusiastic about it,” Paul Zimnisky said.</p>
      <p>Rio Tinto is regarded by mining industry insiders and investors as <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/rio-tinto-eyes-copper-deposit-north-of-la-ronge">a serious player whose involvement in an exploration project indicates there is a real chance that project could be developed into a mine</a>.</p>
      <p>Star Diamond, formerly Shore Gold Inc., has been working to build the mine since 1995. The company issued a brief statement saying it would review Rio Tinto’s notice and provide further information after the review was complete.</p>
      <p>In a preliminary economic assessment released last spring, Star Diamond shaved around $500 million from the expected cost of building the open-pit mine on its Star-Orion South property in the Fort à la Corne forest.</p>
      <p><a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/star-diamond-corp-shaves-510m-from-cost-of-building-mine-near-prince-albert">The project is now expected to cost $1.41 billion and have a lifespan of 34 years</a>.</p>
      <p>The environmental approval comes with multiple accommodations for nearby James Smith Cree Nation, including <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/james-smith-cree-nation-considering-options-after-sask-government-greenlights-diamond-mine">reserving a portion of the forest for band members’ use and $161,250 in annual payments for community programs from Star Diamond</a>.</p>
      <p>Representatives of the First Nation could not immediately be reached for comment on Friday.</p>
      <p>Diamonds make up a small portion of Rio Tinto’s total business — its main commodities are iron ore, copper and aluminum. Star-Orion South is its most advanced diamond project. Both of Rio Tinto’s existing mines are nearing the end of their lifespans.</p>
      <p>The Diavik mine, about 300 kilometres northeast of Yellowknife, NWT, is expected to produce diamonds through 2025. The company’s flagship Argyle operation in Western Australia is slated to close by the end of 2020.</p>
      <p>Zimnisky said while demand for diamonds remains the “big question,” Rio Tinto’s decision is an “important catalyst” for an industry that has been dominated by pessimism in recent months.</p>
      <p>Rio Tinto recently signed a similar option agreement worth up to $30 million over seven years to explore <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/rio-tinto-eyes-copper-deposit-north-of-la-ronge">Forum Energy Metals Corp.’s Janice Lake sedimentary copper deposit</a> in northern Saskatchewan.</p>
