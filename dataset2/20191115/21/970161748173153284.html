      <p>Robbo (Jake Ryan) has been missing for a few days now, and Colby (Tim Franklin) and Jasmine (Sam Frost) are worried sick about him. Jasmine is back at the safe house with Tori (Penny McNamee), while Colby has been working overtime to try and find a lead.</p>
      <p>However, McCarthy (Nicholas Cassim) orders him to take a few days off, which is a relief to Mackenzie (Emily Weir) as they can now make plans. While Colby is looking forward to the break, he is taken aback when he arrives home to find a bloodied up Robbo sitting on the couch.</p>
      <p>Colby immediately asks Robbo where he’s been, but he remains silent, leaving us to wonder what happened since we last saw him in the pit with Dylan Carter (Jeremy Lindsay Taylor). Colby is forced to take a raincheck on his plans with Mackenzie, and she fears for his safety as he gets involved in Robbo’s mystery disappearance.</p>

      <p>Robbo decides to call Jasmine, but hesitates when he sees her name in his phone and puts it down. He decides to leave and grabs his car keys, but Colby stops him and asks him for answers.</p>

      <p>He pushes Robbo to the limit, pressing him for information. This causes Robbo to snap – and he angrily punches Colby in the face. Mackenzie sees the incident, and this only confirms her fears that her boyfriend is in a line of work that’s too dangerous for her to handle.</p>
      <p>As Colby nurses his wound in the Diner, Mackenzie tells him she can’t go on like this. She’s sorry, but they have to break up. She walks away, leaving Colby bruised in more ways than one…</p>
