      <h1>Trump critics are raising money to buy his childhood home</h1>

      <p>President Trump’s childhood home in Queens is a tough sell.</p>
      <p>After <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/02/05/donald-trumps-childhood-home-listed-for-2-9-million/">being listed for $2.9 million</a> and floated as <a href="https://nypost.com/2017/08/08/trumps-childhood-home-is-up-for-rent-on-airbnb/">an Airbnb rental</a>, it was slated for a Nov. 14 auction. But the auction has been <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/09/18/why-does-no-one-want-donald-trumps-childhood-home/?_ga=2.234166622.1354855729.1573754775-2047514065.1564425125">postponed indefinitely</a> — because no one who is interested has enough dough to make a bid.</p>
      <p>Misha Haghani, of Paramount Realty USA, tells The Post the Jamaica Estates house where Trump spent the first four years of his life is off the auction block for now so prospective buyers — which include Trump’s critics — have time to accumulate funds via crowdsourcing sites.</p>
      <p>“We postponed the auction to give campaigns a chance to raise money,” Haghani says.</p>
      <p>In September, LA resident David Yates launched <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/teardowndonaldtrumpshouse">a GoFundMe page</a> seeking $5 million to buy the five-bedroom Tudor home — and then destroy it. So far, his “Tear Down Donald Trump’s House” page, posted on Sept. 22, has garnered $0.</p>
      <p>The 2,000-square-foot home last sold in 2017 for $2.14 million to a Chinese investor. Before that, in 2016, it traded for $1.4 million. Haghani handled both sales. (The median home sale in the neighborhood is just under $1 million, real estate appraisers say.)</p>
      <p>“I want to buy it and tear it down,” Yates wrote on his GoFundMe page. “Trump grew up in the house. God forbid some Trump maniac buys the house and turns it into a shrine, or a museum.” He adds that he will hire a “professional camera crew to film the entire event.”</p>
      <p>Haghani says he has heard from other people who are trying to raise money to buy the home and then put it toward a good cause.</p>
      <p>“People have talked about demolishing it, creating a museum, donating it to immigrants or veterans, creating a presidential library and other things,” Haghani says. “I’d love to see something positive happen with this very unique property, like donating it to a 9/11 first responder, either that or see President Trump buy it himself.”</p>
      <p>The house was built by his real estate developer dad, Fred, who then moved the family to a larger house behind this one. Both are far from the gilded Trump Tower penthouse triplex that the president called his primary residence until <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/31/trump-officially-ditches-nyc-changes-residence-to-florida/">his recent move to Florida</a>.</p>
