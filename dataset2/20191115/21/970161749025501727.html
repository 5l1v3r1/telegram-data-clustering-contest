      <p>It’s not surprising that Ned Willis (Ben Hall) is still struggling in the aftermath of Scarlett’s (Christie Whelan Browne) knife attack, but his decision to keep it a secret could have deadly consequences in Neighbours.</p>
      <p>Ned is in a bad place after lashing out at Yashvi (Olivia Junkeer) and his loved ones don’t know what to do. He doesn’t want their help and they can see that he’s not coping, but they have no idea just how bad things could get.</p>
      <p>He’s found his own way to unleash his pent up anger and aggression, and it’s thanks to that he finally sleeps without having any nightmares.</p>
      <p>But all is not well with Ned, he reacts badly when Dipi accidentally drops a knife and it’s clear his PTSD is rearing its head. Yashvi decides to confront him about his strange behaviour but he angrily fobs her off. And though she’s concerned, she has no idea what he’s really up to in his spare time. He’s on a downward spiral and he’s spinning out of control fast.</p>

      <p>He starts coming home with unexplained injuries and when Finn (Rob Mills) witnesses some dodgy behaviour during a secretive exchange between Ned and Kane at the gym, his Spidey senses start tingling. He tells Bea (Bonnie Anderson) of his concerns who confronts Ned, and she’s given a short shrift for her troubles, but still Ned keeps secret just how much danger is new pastime is putting him in.</p>
      <p>Yashvi is becoming increasingly concerned with Ned’s mental state, and she is more than right to worry. He flips out when she gets too close and she realises something really is not right.</p>

      <p>When Aaron (Matthew Wilson) hears what’s going on he decides something needs to be done, so he starts to follow Ned. He’s led to a secret location and all of his fears are confirmed, Ned has got himself mixed up in something dangerous.</p>
      <p>But things take a dire turn when he watches as Ned snaps during a fight, losing all self-control. He starts pummelling his opponent, who has no chance to escape. Aaron is forced to step in and pull Ned off, but is he too late?</p>
