      <h1>Huawei Mate X finally goes on sale in China, sells out in minutes</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T21:41:48+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 21:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/ryne-hager/" target="_blank">Ryne Hager</a></address>
      <p>Following a <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/04/24/samsung-delays-galaxy-fold-release-in-wake-of-early-hardware-failures/">string</a> of <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/04/24/samsung-delays-galaxy-fold-release-in-wake-of-early-hardware-failures/">delays</a> and an <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/10/14/huawei-mate-x-leak-october-release/">anticipated late-October launch</a>, Huawei's Mate X folding phone has finally <a href="https://www.vmall.com/product/10086831441169.html#10086239677333">gone on sale in China</a> for a mere $2400 (16,999 Chinese Yuan). Or, at least, it <i>was</i> on sale. The phone has reportedly sold out in just minutes, though more rounds of sales are expected to happen in the coming days.</p>
      <p>Although Motorola has just revealed <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/11/13/the-foldable-moto-razr-is-official-coming-exclusively-to-verizon-on-january-9th-for-1500/">its own folding phone</a>, this makes the Mate X the second big-brand foldable phone to be released (though there have been a few <a href="https://youtu.be/XdvJdXSxbSk">smaller Chinese names</a> that even beat the <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/10/10/i-bought-a-galaxy-fold-and-used-it-for-ten-days-here-are-my-thoughts/">Galaxy Fold</a> to market). Unlike both Samsung and Motorola's designs, though, Huawei's Mate X puts the screen on the <i>outside</i> of the phone. While it might make for a bigger screen, it remains to be seen how the Mate X might hold up to long-term use, given that the display is usually one of the most delicate parts of a folding phone.</p>
      <p>The final specs for the much-anticipated phone are just below:</p>

          <td valign="top">Dual SIM dual standby, 5G support</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>The phone even sports sub-6Ghz 5G support on a handful of frequencies, presumably intended for the Chinese market, which isn't as obsessed with mmWave as the US carriers seem to be.</p>
      <p>Although it has great specs on paper, it appears you can't actually buy one right this second, even if you live in China. <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_mate_x_arrives_for_sale_and_promptly_sells_out_in_a_matter_of_minutes-news-40111.php">GSMArena reports</a> that the Mate X sold out within minutes in this first flash sale. <a href="https://www.vmall.com/product/10086831441169.html#10086239677333">Vmall</a> is allegedly the sole retailer for the phone, and at the time of writing, the next wave of sales is set for November 17th.</p>
      <p>Should you have the burning urge to drop Â¥ 16,999 (which works out to a slightly painful $2,425 at the time of writing), you'll have to wait for that next flash sale, and you may have to act fast before <i>that</i> sells out, too.</p>
