        <b>The mayor of a German city was forced to apologize for his comments about a shocking gang rape case, which has drawn a new wave of criticism toward the country’s lax immigration laws.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The crime occurred in the city of Ulm in the southwestern Baden-Wurttemberg state on Halloween but police only reported it this week. The 14-year-old victim was walking late and met with a group of teenage boys and men in their early 20s, one of whom she knew. She agreed to go to the home of one of the suspects and was gang-raped there.</p>
      <p>Three suspects were subsequently arrested, while two more remain at large. At least two of them were confirmed by police to be asylum-seekers but their nationality or country of origin was not revealed.</p>
      <p>Mayor Gunter Czisch was “shocked” by the crime, telling Sudwest Presse that “Ulm is a safe city but there is no such thing as absolute security.” The official then quickly made something of a detour, to ostensibly chastise the girl’s parents.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“I wonder, however, what a 14-year-old-girl would want in Ulm at night. Parents have a duty to ensure that an underage girl does not walk around the city alone. I want to be clear: we all have to take our duties seriously if we want to prevent cases like this one.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>His words immediately raised many eyebrows on social media, as commenters accused the mayor of being tone-deaf and engaging in victim-blaming. “The gentleman’s empathy is just cold,” one person <a href="https://twitter.com/bettina_CLB/status/1194956942243971072">said</a>. “Unbelievable… who elects such people?” asked another.</p>
      <p>Czisch quickly apologized, insisting he was misunderstood. “Of course, the girl is not at fault. The blame for this act lies solemnly and clearly on the suspected perpetrators,” he said.</p>
      <p>Some critics felt that the official’s attitude reflects the government’s lax immigration laws and controversial ‘open doors’ policy with regards to asylum-seekers from the Middle East and Africa, which have flooded Germany since the mid-2010s. “Mayor Czisch wants to distract us from viewing crimes as being tied to irresponsible immigration and asylum policies. Quite pathetic,” one Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/f_kierkegaard/status/1194643474110386177">said</a>.</p>
      <p>One lawmaker, from the anti-immigration ‘Alternative for Germany’ (AfD) party, Martin Reichardt, <a href="https://twitter.com/M_Reichardt_AfD/status/1194889105479483392">argued</a> that Czisch’s words exposed the “deceptive” rhetoric of the government. “Their failed asylum policy created thousands of such ‘isolated’ crimes,” he said.</p>
      <p>An AfD politician from Ulm, Markus Moessle <a href="https://www.swp.de/suedwesten/staedte/ulm/vergewaltigung-in-ulm-das-sagt-afd-gemeinderat-markus-moessle-zum-missbrauchsvorfall-40548234.html">said</a> that the authorities should focus on making the city safer for locals, rather than “a safe heaven” for asylum-seekers from abroad.</p>
      <p>Migration remains a hot-button issue in German politics, as a number of terrorist attacks, rapes and other high-profile crimes were committed by asylum-seekers and refugees in recent years. In November, a failed asylum seeker murdered an 87-year-old-woman during a robbery attempt. In January, a refugee from Afghanistan stabbed a pregnant woman in a hospital, causing her to lose her baby.</p>
      <p>During the 2015-2016 New Year’s Eve celebrations, hundreds of women in Cologne and other cities reported being sexually assaulted by gangs of migrants.</p>
