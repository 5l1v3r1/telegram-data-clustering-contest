      <h1>Danny Lee settles for 62 to lead Mayakoba Classic in Mexico</h1>

      <p><b>PLAYA DEL CARMEN, Mexico (AP)</b> - Danny Lee felt like he could make everything Friday, and for the longest time he did.</p>
      <p>Already at 10-under par through 13 holes, Lee started thinking about a sub-60 round when he hit a downhill birdie putt too hard and wound up three-putting for bogey. Four pars later, he had to settle for a 9-under 62 and a one-shot lead among early starters in the Mayakoba Classic.</p>
      <p>"Definitely, it was in my head, 59 or 58," Lee said. "I never shot that score out on the PGA Tour before, so I really wanted to make that happen. On 14, I had a 3% downhill, less than 15-footer for birdie. Just one of those days I felt like I can make anything. I just gave a little too much extra and hit it through the break and missed the next one coming back.</p>
      <p>"I was a little bit bummed out on that one," he said. "But still, 9 under is a great start."</p>
      <p>Lee had a one-shot lead over Adam Long and Brendon Todd, who resurrected his career two weeks ago with a win in the Bermuda Championship.</p>
      <p>The first round started a day late because of heavy rains - more than 9 inches since Monday - that left El Camaleon flooded and forced a washout Thursday. The second round was scheduled for Saturday, and because of limited daylight in November, the tournament will not end until Monday.</p>
      <p>Lee shot 29 on the front nine, including a five-hole stretch he played in 6 under. The 62 matched his career-best round on the PGA Tour, a 62 he shot in the third round of the 2015 John Deere Classic.</p>
      <p>Long and Todd already have won this year - Long at the Desert Classic in January when he beat Phil Mickelson, and Todd in a big surprise in Bermuda.</p>
      <p>"I proved in Bermuda that I can kind of get into that mentality where I can go low again, and I basically started the day and said, ‘Let's try and birdie every hole.' I know it's going to be soft and there's going to be birdies out there."</p>
      <p>He had four birdies on each side against no bogeys on the rain-softened course.</p>
      <p>Defending champion Matt Kuchar had a pair of double bogeys in his round of 69 that left him seven shots behind.</p>
      <p>Lee's only PGA Tour victory was four years ago at the Greenbrier. He is coming off a strong Asian swing, with a runner-up finish to Justin Thomas at the CJ Cup in South Korea, and a tie for 10th in Japan, where Tiger Woods won his 82nd career PGA Tour title.</p>
      <p>He was runner-up to Kuchar a year ago, and he tied for third at Mayakoba in 2015.</p>
      <p>"Something about this course that just suits my eye very well," Lee said. "I can read the breaks very well and I putted very well today."</p>
      <p>Past champion Graeme McDowell was among those at 66, along with Abraham Ancer of Mexico.</p>
