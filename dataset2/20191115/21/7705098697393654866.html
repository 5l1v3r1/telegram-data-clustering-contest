      <h1>Anthony Mackie Talks About the Importance of Being Captain America</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T21:15:11+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 21:15</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Workman</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/avengers-endgame"><b>Avengers: Endgame</b></a> wrapped up the Infinity saga and gave the original Captain America, Steve Rogers, a fitting ending. Steve also gave his iconic shield to his friend, Sam Wilson, aka the Falcon. That moment still carries a great deal of emotional weight for Anthony Mackie, who portrays the high-flying hero. During an interview with <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/anthony-mackie-the-banker-seberg-apple-tv-amazon-studios-interview-news-1202785392/">Deadline</a>, Mackie explained its importance to him. </p>
      <p>“You know what, to be honest, it’s very emotional,” said Mackie. “I’ve been in the business for 20 years and I’ve been fortunate to do some amazing stuff and work with amazing people. For me, to be a Black man in 2019 and be given the helm of Captain America with the history of Black men in this country is a monumental step, not only in entertainment, but also in my life. It’s been extremely emotional. Look, my grandfather was a sharecropper, you know what I mean? There’s a lot of history and pain and triumph and joy that comes along with me being Captain America.”</p>

      <p>Mackie also spoke about his new Disney+ series, <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier"><b>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</b></a>; which began filming this month. </p>
      <p>“That’s what we’re doing now with <b>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</b>,” added Mackie. “We’ve been doing three weeks of script work. We meet, we read the different scenes, go over it, rewrite it, tweak it to where it works. We’ve always done that. Marvel has always been very open-minded about letting us hone the scripts to our character. Because even from the first movie, <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/captain-america"><b>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</b></a>, the Russos were always very open to my feedback. It’s an ongoing, evolving process every day.”</p>
      <p><b>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</b> will hit Disney+ in fall 2020.</p>
