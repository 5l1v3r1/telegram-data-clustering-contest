      <h1>Notice being served on 141 illegal brick kilns in Coimbatore</h1>
      <h2>Violators will have to show cause within 15 days of receiving notice: Collector</h2>

      <p>The Coimbatore district administration is serving notice on 141 brick kilns that were operating illegally without permits in five panchayats in Thadagam valley, directing them to immediately stop production. Over 200 brick kilns operate in that area, according to activists.</p>
      <p>District Collector K. Rajamani said the violators would have to show cause within 15 days of receiving the notice as to why their units should not be closed for violating rules.</p>
      <p>Village officers were tasked to issue the notice dated October 29 to each brick kiln in person and record the date of issue to track the reply. Issuing of notice was going on this week too, said a village officer.</p>
      <p>The large scale violation came to light in a detailed study conducted by the Collector involving agencies such as Revenue Department, Pollution Control Board and Geology and Mining Department.</p>
      <p>The study found that the agencies had not issued the mandatory permits to the 141 brick kins - all located in the geologically significant Palakkad Gap of the Westen Ghats - to mine, transport, and stock red earth for brick making. The notice said mining, transporting and stocking the natural resource was a crime under Sections 4 (1) and 4 (1-A) of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulations) Act 1957.</p>
      <p>It said that brick manufacturers should go by the Tamil Nadu Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1959 to get permits from the District Collector for operating brick kilns. The Rules says that the manufacturers should also produce copies of permit issued by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB), State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) and no objection certificate from the Hill Area Conservation Authority (HACA) to the Collector along with the application.</p>
      <p>Of the five panchayats, Chinna Thadagam, Nanjundapuram, Veerapandi and Somaiyampalayam are listed as places that lie in hill areas as per an annexure to the Government Order-49 on HACA dated March 24, 2009.</p>
      <p>In a report in September this year, <i>The Hindu</i> had exposed that TNPCB had not issued permits to any of the brick kilns in Thadagam valley.</p>
      <p>S. Ganesh of Thadagam, who obtained the information through the Right to Information (RTI) Act, said that not a single brick kiln was closed for operating without the permit though the TNPCB admitted the fact.</p>
      <p>He pointed out that the TNPCB also violated norms instructed by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in June 2017 which says that “brick kilns operating without permission and valid consent from State Pollution Control Boards, and those not meeting prescribed norms should be closed with immediate effect”.</p>
      <p>Coimbatore-based environment activist K. Mohanraj said that the TNPCB also failed to check another instruction from the CPCB which directed brick manufacturers to convert their facilities from ‘natural draft brick kiln’ to ‘induced draft brick kiln’ (zig-zag brick setting with rectangular shape of kin), a less pollutant alternative.</p>
      <p>“Brick manufacturers in the valley are yet to introduce the zig-zag system recommended by the CPCB. The TNPCB has failed to ensure compliance to this conversion while brick kiln owners have invested in massive machinery to increase production,” he alleged.</p>
