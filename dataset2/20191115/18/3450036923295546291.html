      <p>OTTUMWA, Iowa â€” An Ottumwa woman is helping her mother get back on her feet after a camper she had been staying in was lost to a fire.</p>
      <p>Tracy Dixson was visiting family in Florida last month when a suspected electrical failure started the fire.</p>
      <p>"I was immediately like, 'Oh my God is she OK, is she hurt, how is the dog and the cat, how much does she have left, will I have to go down there?'," said Dixson's daughter, Haven Kriegshauser.</p>
      <p>Dixson and her pets made it out safely. But...</p>
      <p>"She lost pretty much all of her possessions," Kriegshauser said.</p>
      <p>Dixson had just paid nearly $4,000 to remodel the used camper. Now, Kriegshauser tells KTVO the RV is destroyed.</p>
      <p>"So she basically had to start from the ground up, so we were really just trying to get her situated," she said.</p>
      <p>Kriegshauser started a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/thdzw-help-mom-get-back-on-her-feet">GoFundMe</a> account for her mom. Kriegshauser has already raised more than half of her $2,500 goal.</p>
      <p>"Because of this, she's actually been able to take care of herself during this time," Kriegshauser said. "That's really important to me, I worry about her a lot."</p>
