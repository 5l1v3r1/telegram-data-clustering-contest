      <p>Amazon has the Samsung POWERbot R7070 robot vacuum <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">on sale</a> right now, for a whopping $300 off of its regular price. Bringing it down to just $399.</p>
      <p>That's a really big discount, and one that you don't often see. And that makes this the perfect time to pick up a POWERbot R7070 robot vacuum to clean your home.</p>
      <p>The POWERbot R7070 is a really great robot vacuum to pick up, and it's one of the best out there right now. What's cool though, about this one, is that the top of it is semi transparent. This allows you to see it in action, which is really cool. But that doesn't help clean your carpet. The brushes do.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>There are two front brushes with a center brush that will get up all of the dirt off of your carpet and even laminate floors. As this one is great at adjusting to different floor types.</p>
      <p>It also does really well with suction. Samsung says it has a whopping 40x more suction than any other circular-designed robot vacuum â€“ most robot vacuums are between 1500 and 2000Pa, Samsung has this one at 5160Pa! So that means that it won't leave any dirt behind and will be great for those that have pets.</p>
      <p>It does also work with the app on your smartphone, so you can adjust the suction level, as well as where the POWERbot R7070 is currently cleaning. It also works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and since this is a Samsung product, there's support for Bixby as well. Allowing you to control the Samsung POWERbot R7070 with your voice. That's a pretty popular feature with robot vacuums these days, and good to see it on the POWERbot R7070 too.</p>
