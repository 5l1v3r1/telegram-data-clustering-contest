      <p>On Saturday, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour">Labour</a> will hold its clause V meeting to finalise the contents of its election manifesto. Here are five key areas of debate:</p>
      <h3>Climate change</h3>
      <p>A motion passed at conference suggested Labour would target <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/24/labour-set-to-commit-to-net-zero-emissions-by-2030">net zero emissions in 2030</a> – though the wrangling over the wording was so intense it took two separate compositing meetings to reach agreement.</p>
      <p>Unions, and in particular the GMB, are concerned this is an unachievable target, and would result in mass job losses. They reckon they have won this one: when Rebecca Long-Bailey announced Labour’s policy in October, it included a target of reaching net zero by “the 2030s”.</p>
      <h3>Migration</h3>
      <p>Len McCluskey’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/13/mccluskey-tells-corbyn-defy-calls-extend-freedom-of-movement">high-profile intervention this week</a> – warning against any significant increase in migration without tougher labour market laws – was a window into the struggle between two aspects of Corbynism.</p>
      <p>Across the new left, including the campaign group Momentum, which has recently begun taking more of an interest in policy, there is a desire to shift Labour to a much more open approach, definitively rejecting the approach symbolised by Ed Miliband’s “Controls on Immigration” mugs in 2015.</p>
      <p>But the Labour leader’s trade union backers – and many of his close advisers – are conscious of the risk of alienating Brexit-supporting Labour voters, many of whom, they believe, remain concerned about migration. They are expected to win this one too.</p>
      <h3>Brexit</h3>
      <p>Labour’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum">Brexit</a> policy has evolved significantly over the past 12 months, under significant pressure from pro-remain members of the shadow cabinet, including Keir Starmer and Tom Watson.</p>
      <p>But with Watson leaving parliament, and Starmer and fellow remainer Emily Thornberry all but absent from the campaigning frontline, there is unlikely to be any further change in the manifesto.</p>
      <p>Indeed, Corbyn kicked off the campaign by telling the Guardian: “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/03/obey-brexit-jeremy-corbyn-warns-cabinet-dissenters">The debate is over</a>” – and signalling that he would not say until after an election which side he would take in a referendum.</p>
      <h3>Scottish independence</h3>
      <p>Labour is keen not to suffer the fate of Miliband, who spent much of the 2015 campaign batting away hypothetical questions about how he would deal with a hung parliament, and ended up Photoshopped into Nicola Sturgeon’s pocket.</p>
      <p>But at the same time, Corbyn’s team knows its path to power may well lie in persuading Sturgeon’s party to support Labour as a minority administration – and Corbyn himself is instinctively keen on self-determination for small states.</p>
      <p>Corbyn appeared to suggest his party would not accept another independence referendum in the first term of a Labour government this week – but aides later clarified his position to say it would not be in the first year or two. Expect this part of the manifesto to have been pored over intensely.</p>
      <h3>Tax and spend</h3>
      <p>John McDonnell has said he will publish a “grey book” alongside Labour’s manifesto, setting out his costings for the party’s policies and how they will be paid for.</p>
      <p>He has already said he would raise the top rate of tax to 50p for workers earning more than £150,000 a year, repeating a 2017 plan; and announced a new tax on media giants to pay for Labour’s broadband plan – but there may well be more tax changes to come.</p>
      <p>Labour will be keen to counter the perception, pushed hard by the Conservatives this week, that ordinary taxpayers will end up footing the bill.</p>
      <p>But it will also want to avoid thinktanks such as the Institute for Fiscal Studies picking holes in its plans.</p>
