      <h1>Nebraska Football Has Dismissed Senior LB Tyrin Ferguson From Team</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T18:28:15+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 18:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>With the regular season only a few weeks away from coming to an end, Nebraska’s football program made a major decision involving a former three-star recruit, linebacker Tyrin Ferguson.</p>
      <p>Nebraska entered this year with high expectations because of Scott Frost’s ability to rebuild a program. However, the team has struggled over the past month.</p>
      <p>Earlier this season, the Cornhuskers had to remove Maurice Washington from the depth chart due to rules violations. Now, the coaching staff is moving on from an upperclassman.</p>
      <p>According to Sean Callahan of <a href="https://nebraska.rivals.com/news/huskers-part-ways-with-olb-tyrin-ferguson">HuskersOnline.com</a>, the Cornhuskers have dismissed outside linebacker Tyrin Ferguson from the team.</p>
      <p>This is a tough end to Ferguson’s career at Nebraska as the senior’s season is now over.</p>
      <p>Ferguson showed promise in his junior season with the Huskers, totaling 36 tackles and one sack. His production this year has declined dramatically as he’ll finish his senior campaign with just four tackles.</p>

      <p>The timing of this news is quite interesting, as Nebraska <a href="https://thespun.com/big-ten/nebraska-cornhuskers/nebraska-wisconsin-game-time-spread-channel-announcers">hosts No. 14 Wisconsin tomorrow afternoon</a>.</p>
      <p>Ferguson hasn’t played since October, which means the defense shouldn’t be taking too much of a hit from Ferguson’s departure. That said, the Cornhuskers can’t really afford to deal with any other off-field distractions this year.</p>
      <p>Nebraska’s football program hasn’t released a statement on this news yet. Expect a response to come out before kickoff on Saturday.</p>
