      <p>Nov. 15 (UPI) -- Use and possession of marijuana will be legal in Michigan on Dec. 1, but 79 percent of the state's municipalities have banned retail marijuana businesses from opening.</p>
      <p>Of the state's 1,773 cities, townships and villages, nearly 1,400, including the city of Detroit, <a href="https://www.metrotimes.com/detroit/detroit-bans-recreational-marijuana-joining-79-of-michigan-municipalities/Content?oid=23120523">have chosen</a> not to be involved in the sale of recreational marijuana to those 21 and older. Voters supported legislation permitting legalization of marijuana in a November 2018 referendum with 55.9 percent <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2018/11/07/Marijuana-legalization-approved-in-3-states-rejected-by-North-Dakota/1781541611689/">voting in favor</a>, but municipalities can deny business permits.</p>
      <p>Those communities will not share in the 10 percent excise tax. A report by the Michigan Fiscal Agency said marijuana sales are expected to generate $180.5 million in taxes in 2020, a figure expected to increase to $287.9 million by 2023.</p>
      <p>The cities of <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Ann_Arbor/?tps=1">Ann Arbor</a>, Ferndale and Ypsilanti are expected to be hubs of the new industry in the state. SkyMint, Michigan's largest medical marijuana company, opened a <a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/2019/11/michigans-largest-marijuana-company-opening-store-in-ann-arbor.html">retail dispensary</a> on Friday in Ann Arbor. It plans to sell to the public pending receipt of a recreational-use license.</p>
      <p>"We absolutely want to open it up to adult use," Summer Ransom-Cleveland, SkyMint president, said. "Ann Arbor has always been so welcoming to this kind of industry and I feel it's truly our patient base and customer base ... we've been waiting on this location for close to a year now."</p>
      <p>The state's <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Marijuana/?tps=1">Marijuana</a> Regulatory Agency began accepting applications from businesses ready to sell, process or grown recreational marijuana. Forty-seven businesses have pre-qualified for licenses but some, including five in Detroit, cannot open until the bans are lifted.</p>
      <p>Residents of a municipality can override their community's bans by gathering petitions and putting the matter on a ballot. About 11 communities have rejected proposals to overturn bans.</p>
