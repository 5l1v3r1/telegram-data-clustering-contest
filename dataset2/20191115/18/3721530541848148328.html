      <p>After my new Sim spent a long day hitting the books for my macroeconomics exam, I figured it was OK for her to take a break. So she headed down to an impromptu DJ party out in the wilderness. After studying all day, what’s wrong with one party?</p>
      <p>After a few drinks and some dancing, she ended up taking a dump in a bush and then falling asleep <i>in</i> that poop bush. Finally, she woke up in a panic when she realized she had to get back to campus to finish a presentation, and ran home, humiliated and so stinky that green lines wafted from her with every step. Her dormmates, who had been watching a movie together and eating pizza, all turned to stare at her as she made the walk of shame to the showers.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/pc/store/mac-pc-download-addon-the-sims-4-discover-university">The<i> Sims 4 Discover University </i>expansion pack</a> is full of moments like these that reflect <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/the-sims-4/12679"><i>The Sims 4</i></a> at its best: relatable life situations that lead into wild stories. <i>University</i> doesn’t have big, shocking features like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/6/24/18715518/the-sims-4-island-living-expansion-review-sulani-features-pc"><i>Island Living</i>’s mermaids</a> or <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/9/9/20855811/the-sims-4-realm-of-magic-review"><i>Realm of Magic</i>’s not-Hogwarts</a>, but it knocks a more mundane experience out of the park. This is the best expansion since <i>Seasons,</i> and I much prefer these grounded elements to the occult whimsy and wonder of other expansions.</p>
      <p><i>The Sims</i><i> 4</i> absolutely nails everything most Sims fans would want out of an expansion pack — but that success also highlights the flaws inherent in <i>The Sims 4</i>’s base experience.</p>

      <h3>School of hard knocks</h3>
      <p>In <i>The Sims 3</i>, University was completely isolated from traditional Sims worlds. Players couldn’t invite a friend to a dorm, take a trip home, or easily navigate between different Sims who were on and off campus.</p>
      <p>Now, <i>Discover University</i> is integrated nicely into the game. A Sim can apply for higher education at any time, and choose their course load as well. From there, I select where they live — do they head to the new student town and live in a dorm? Maybe they end up in other on-campus housing, or attend University while going about my business in one of the existing worlds like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/1/10/14230938/vampire-dlc-bringing-creepy-fiends-to-the-sims-4">vampire haven Forgotten Hollow.</a></p>
      <p>I can pick a standard degree for my Sim and fill their course load with mandatory classes related to one special skill, like logic or writing. If I’m craving variety, I can grab elective classes that cover everything from DJ playlists to flower arrangements. I can even pick their school: Foxbury, a modern school more suited for STEM, or Brittechester, a school that’s for students of the humanities. Players can min-max their education, or just take whatever classes look appealing at whichever school has a more appealing vibe.</p>
      <p>Once I’ve signed my Sim up, they’ve got to make it to class and earn credits towards their degree. Classes themselves aren’t sophisticated gameplay wise — just like most careers, I get a notification that my Sim has a class, they pack up and go, and I return with some homework to do or an exam to study for.</p>
      <p>This means that difficulty is whatever I want it to be. Working a full-time job <i>and</i> taking a full course load means that my Sim is constantly, and perilously, balancing priorities while trying desperately to maintain their biological needs. If I live in a dorm, I don’t get to customize my environment or have access to my own stove, but there’s a constant flood of Sims coming in and out and my social will always be pumped.</p>
      <p>I can work a coffee shop and take a couple of easy-A classes paid for with student loans while dating my dormmates, or be an overachiever who has accounted for every second of the day. Both are interesting gameplay experiences that make a normal <i>The Sims 4</i> run a lot more engaging. It feels like a major missing part of a Sim’s lifecycle is now available, and it’s the best take the franchise has ever had on post-secondary education.</p>
      <p>There’s also a new bike object which can ride around lots or be used to travel between worlds. These are the systems that Sims fans tend to get excited about — seemingly mundane things that allow players to reflect a common part of real life. Even the zaniest soap operas are anchored by real things and real life events, after all.</p>

      <h3>Foundational issues</h3>
      <p>The biggest problems with <i>The Sims 4: Discover University</i> aren’t with the University part of the game; they’re lasting problems with <i>The Sims 4</i> itself. There’s one new aspiration for Sims — getting educated — but no new traits. Right now, aspirations are the biggest thing that differentiate Sims from each other. A master actress and career criminal are going to lead two very different lives.</p>
      <p>But traits, in theory, should also be an important way to mark Sims as different. A fun-loving, cat owning commitment phobe should feel and play very differently than an artsy, free-loving designer.</p>
      <p>Right now, traits don’t seem to add much in the way of gameplay. Sure, a vegetarian can’t eat meat, or someone who hates babies shouldn’t have a kid ... but if they do those things, they are merely afflicted with a minor moodlet. The more expansion packs a player has, or the more they know how to manipulate <i>The Sims 4</i>’s base systems, the less that the challenges brought about by traits matter.</p>
      <p>It’s very easy to skate through <i>The Sims 4</i> while many professions play the same way, with traits acting mostly as window dressing. It takes a minor but ongoing effort to keep two Sims’ stories straight in my imagination — <i>she’s</i> the pro gamer and <i>he’s</i> the mathematician. But when both of them end up sitting down and filling a green bar over their head, those two distinct life paths can feel the same, even though the scenery is different.</p>
      <p>Add in minor technical issues, like Sims struggling with queued actions, and things get frustrating. Even a Sim with maximum free will can’t always attend to their basic needs if their action queue decides not to work. I lost an hour of progress when a student of mine — who was also a vampire — stood in the sun for several hours despite having maximum free will on. The larger a family, the more irritating this gets — I have to check each member of the family to make sure they’re doing their assigned tasks, or taking care of their own biological needs. This has been a problem in <i>The Sims 4</i> for some time now, but when I have assignments due and exams in the morning, the bug is extra infuriating.</p>
      <p>Making matters worse, the menu I use to check my upcoming classes and progress is difficult to navigate and requires a lot of scrolling. Why not use the existing calendar system, or at least prepare an easy to read spreadsheet? As it is, I have to go to my job window and then scroll through my degree and overall performance, then each class and their requirements.</p>
      <p>These little annoyances aren’t game breaking, but they do detract from the experience every time I play. And the ongoing, usability struggles grow in number and complexity with the number of expansions installed on top of <i>The Sims 4</i>.</p>
      <p>And yet, even when things go wrong and I need to save scum, I still enjoy putting in the time. I still have stress dreams some day that I’m back in school and the exam is tomorrow and I haven’t studied; it’s nice to see a critical part of my life back in <i>The Sims 4,</i> where it can inspire a whole new set of anxieties and disasters.</p>
      <p>The Sims 4: Discover University <i>is now available on Windows PC, and will be available on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 on December 17. The game was reviewed using final “retail” download codes provided by Electronic Arts.
