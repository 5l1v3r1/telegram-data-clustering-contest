      <p>Decks have been cleared for the State government takeover of the Central public sector enterprise Hindustan Newsprint Ltd. (HNL) at Velloor with the liquidator appointed by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) finalising the government’s offer to buy the shares of the company at ₹25 crore.</p>
      <p>Representatives of Hindustan Paper Corporation Ltd., the holding company, and the creditors have accepted the government’s offer and the official liquidator will now place it before the NCLT, New Delhi Bench, for issue of final orders, according to senior government officials associated with the process.</p>
      <p>Senior representatives of the Public Sector Undertakings Restructuring and Internal Audit Board and HNL were part of the negotiation process.</p>
      <h3>Revival plans</h3>
      <p>The government’s revival plans of the public sector company will be finalised after the completion of the process of buying the shares of HNL.</p>
      <p>The unit, which has 1,200 employees on its rolls, offers employment to about 5,000 persons indirectly. The factory is located on 700 acres provided by the State government.</p>
      <h3>Staff hopeful</h3>
      <p>R. Chandrasekharan, president, Indian National Trade Union Congress, said the decision to buy the shares of HNL from the holding company had provided hope to hundreds of employees who had not received their salary and other benefits for the past 12 months.</p>
      <p>Mr. Chandrasekharan and Centre of Indian Trade Unions general secretary Elamaram Kareem had sent a joint letter to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan earlier stating that the company had been registering profit till 2011-12, but turned sick due to competition from imported newsprint, increasing cost of production, and plant and machinery becoming obsolete.</p>
      <p>They had said that the unit could be operated profitably by manufacturing paper for government presses, public sector undertakings and educational institutions in the State.</p>
