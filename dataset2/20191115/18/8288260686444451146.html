      <p>People are being urged to sign up for warnings as fears for Christmas floods rise.</p>
      <p>The Met Office has warned that we're on track for the wettest autumn on record and a senior government official has said front line teams will remain on high alert throughout the festive season.</p>
      <p>John Curtin, executive director of flood and coastal risk management at the Environment Agency, warned that "everywhere is super sensitive to rain" as he urged homeowners to take steps to prepare themselves.</p>
      <p>And he stressed the importance of being aware of the flood risk of your home in light of the "phenomenally wet" conditions, reports <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/government-tell-risk-public-sign-20889310">the Mirror</a> .</p>

      <p>He said: "A number of our front line teams are now rostered all the way through Christmas already.</p>
      <p>"We don't want people to think it happened to Fishlake, it won't happen to me. Today it is Evesham, tomorrow where next?</p>
      <p>"The sensitivity of catchments to any more rainfall is very significant and only 50% of people who live on flood plains are signed up to flood warnings."</p>
      <p>Will Lang, Head of Civil Contingencies at the Met Office said: "It has been a very wet autumn in many parts and I think what we have seen over the last weeks is the culmination of this.</p>
      <p>"Some places are close to having their wettest autumn on record and we have two more weeks of November to go."</p>
