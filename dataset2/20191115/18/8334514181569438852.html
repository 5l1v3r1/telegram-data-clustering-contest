        <figcaption><b>'How could our system fail like this?': Yovanovitch<br/></b>The former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, branded "bad news" by President Donald Trump, defended her record and told an impeachment hearing on Friday she had pursued anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine and did not understand why the Trump administration removed her.</figcaption>

      <p>Marie Yovanovitch told the U.S. House Intelligence Committee that not all Ukrainians “embraced” U.S. anti-corruption work.</p>
      <p>“Thus, perhaps, it was not surprising, that when our anti-corruption efforts got in the way of a desire for profit or power, Ukrainians who preferred to play by the old, corrupt rules sought to remove me. What continues to amaze me is that they found Americans willing to partner with them and, working together, they apparently succeeded in orchestrating the removal of a U.S. ambassador,” she said.</p>
