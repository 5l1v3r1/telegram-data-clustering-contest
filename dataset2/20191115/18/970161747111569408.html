        <b>It’s been a hellish end to the year for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/daniel-osbourne/">Daniel Osbourne</a> (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/rob-mallard/">Rob Mallard</a>) as he is currently facing the traumatic grief of losing his beloved wife Sinead to cancer. As he battles his feelings of desperate loss, he is also trying to do his best by Bertie but Coronation Street fans know that he isn’t coping.</b>
      </p>
      <p>While Peter Barlow (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/chris-gascoyne/">Chris Gascoyne</a>) manages to convince him to come home for Sinead’s funeral, things kick off again for him after his painful goodbye as he loses memories of his beloved Sinead when the laptop containing her final videos is stolen.</p>
      <p>He goes off the rails and the police have to get involved when he storms into a shop and accuses the seller of dealing in stolen goods. But that is just the beginning of the journey for the long suffering character as his turmoil won’t end any time soon.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.insidesoap.co.uk/">Rob told The Inside Soap Yearbook 2020</a>: ‘I always see the story as being in split into two, the first part was leading up to the death, and the other is about being a widower at a young age, and not knowing how to navigate that.</p>

      <p>‘Sinead’s death was a peak, but this story won’t be winding down anytime soon.’</p>
      <p>Revealing his mixed feelings about finding out that Sinead was going to die, Rob added: ‘I was sad to see Katie leave but glad to take on the story. And I was glad to know it was going to be handled the way it was.</p>
      <p>Katie kept saying that she wanted Sinead to die, to show the consequences of doing what she did with the alternative therapies and stuff like that. To get what we wanted – girls getting themselves checked – Sinead had to die to have that impact.’</p>
