      <p>Two 17-year-old students drowned and another one went missing in the Meenachil river at Poovathumood, near Kottayam, on Monday.</p>
      <p>The deceased were identified as K.C. Allen, son of K.C. Chacko of Chingavanam and Shibin Jacob, son of K.C. Joy of Meenadam. A massive search operation is on to trace Aswin K Prasad, a native of Vadavathoor, who went missing in the river. The victims were pursuing their Plus Two course with the IHRD School in Puthuppally.</p>
      <p>According to the police, the incident took place around 1.50 p.m. at a location close to the hanging bridge at Poovathumood. The trio were part of an eight-member team of students from the school.</p>
      <p>“Aswin, who had stepped into the waterbody to clean his legs, was the first to go missing. He was followed by Allen, who attempted to lend a hand to rescue Aswin, while Shibin jumped into the waterbody to rescue both of them,” said an officer.</p>
      <p>On an alert raised by the remaining students, a few locals rushed to the spot and soon the police and the Fire and Rescue Services were called in.</p>
      <p>A scuba team of the Fire and Rescue Services, Kottayam, carried out a massive search operation with the help of local people and the dead bodies of Allen and Shibin were fished out by 4 p.m.</p>
