      <h1>Huawei will reveal its iPad Pro competitor on November 25</h1>
      <h2>The MatePad Pro takes some clear cues from Apple's tablet</h2>

      <p>A few weeks ago, <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/11/15/huawei-matepad-pro-leaks/">rumors and images</a> of a supposed Huawei MatePad Pro started to hit the web. As you can probably guess by the name, it’s the company’s take on an iPad Pro competitor.</p>
      <p>At the time we didn’t have a firm release date, but now it seems the tablet will arrive as soon as this month: Huawei CEO Richard Yu made a <a href="https://www.weibo.com/1100856704/IgjJHhVy6">Weibo post</a> teasing a MatePad even for November 25.</p>
      <p>At a glance, it’d be easy to mistake the tablet for an iPad Pro. Granted, there are only so many ways to design a tablet, but it has relatively slim bezels, a very Apple-Pencil-looking stylus, and a grey keyboard. That said, it appears to come in several colorways, and the screen features a hole-punch camera, so there’s that.</p>

      <p>Spec-wise, the tablet appears to sport the new Kirin 990 Chip in the Mate 30 Pro, and 8GB of RAM. As usual, it’s basically a flagship phone blown up into a larger form factor, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing, especially if Huawei has optimized thermals to eke a bit more performance out of the tablet than its smartphone.</p>
      <p>The event is being held in Shanghai and we’ve seen little fanfare about the tablet from Huawei‘s European marketing, so it’s fair to assume the company is focusing on a China release for now. Still, we’re curious to see how the tablet holds up in the real world, given the scarcity of decent Android tablets.</p>
