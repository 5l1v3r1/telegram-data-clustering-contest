      <h1>Kano elders to meet Fashola over bad state of Kano-Gwarzo-Dayi road</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T18:45:03+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 18:45</time> by <a rel="author">Agency Report</a></address>
      <p>Worried by the deteriorating state of Kano-Gwarzo-Dayi road which links Kano to four states, communities in the area have resolved to send a special delegation to meet with the Minister of Works, Babatunde Fashola, to elicit government action.</p>
      <p>“We are formally going to lodge a complainant on the deplorable condition of the Kano-Gwarzo-Dayi road, which has become a death trap,” the member representing Gwarzo constituency, Yunusa Haruna-Kauyu, told the <i>News Agency of Nigeria</i> in Kano on Friday.</p>
      <p>He said the delegation will comprise the Kano State Commissioner of Works, Muazu Magaji; the Senator representing Kano North senatorial zone, Sen. Barau Jibrin-Maliya; and members of the House of Representatives from the zone, among others.</p>
      <p>“It is necessary to meet the minister in order to express the concerns of our people on the deteriorating condition of the road.</p>

      <p>“It is a very important road which links Kano with four other states and Niger Republic.</p>
      <p>“The potholes along the road had witnessed a number of patches, but even the potholes that were patched last year have already gone off.</p>
      <p>“What this road requires now is total rehabilitation not patching of potholes.</p>
      <p>“So we want the Federal Government to look at the possibility of awarding contract for the total rehabilitation of the road,” Haruna-Kauyu said.</p>
      <p>NAN reports that the Kano-Gwarzo-Dayi road is a major link to Katsina, Sokoto, Zamfara and Kebbi states, as well as parts of Niger Republic.</p>
      <p>The road was constructed during the administration of military President, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida and had never witnessed any major rehabilitation since then.</p>
      <p>The lawmaker said that the total rehabilitation of the road would boost social and economic activities across the four states and beyond.</p>
