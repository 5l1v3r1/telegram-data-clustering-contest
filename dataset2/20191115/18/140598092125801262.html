      <h1>British Psychological Society apologises for 'distressing' members after failing to warn them about anti-slavery performance </h1>

      <p>THE British Psychological Society (BPS) has apologised for the "distress" caused to its members after failing to warn them about an anti-slavery performance during one of its conferences.</p>
      <p>Delegates in attendance at the annual Group of Trainers in Clinical Psychology (GTiCP) forum, held at the University of Liverpool, received no prior notice about a 12-minute dramatisation of the transatlantic slave trade.</p>
      <p>The performance, staged by a Toxteth-based Capoeira group, which combines an Afro-Brazilian martial art, dance and live music, drew criticism over a scene interpreted as a slave auction.</p>
      <p>The group swiftly denied the scene was an "auction re-enactment", but explained it was intended to present the "process of dehumanising a person" through slavery.</p>
      <p>Following criticism including a social media backlash from academics, the BPS admitted it hadn't "thought sufficiently" about the performance and was not aware of the "overall emotional tone".</p>
      <p>Clinical Psychologist Chris Jones wrote: “Let’s not equivocate: The re-enactment of the slave auction at #GTiCP2019 was a shameful day in the history of British Clinical Psychology. </p>
      <p>“The Vague references, an atmosphere of silence and subtle justifications perpetuate the inequalities that our colleagues face every day.” </p>
      <p>While Parashar Ramanuj, a psychiatrist, wrote: “I have no words. </p>
      <p>"If anyone should understand about trauma passed down through generations, surely it would be a group of psychologists."</p>
      <p>Organisers explained the performance was booked as part of plans to replace the usual format of the conference's entertainment with a "more challenging social programme".</p>
      <p>In a statement published on its website, the BPS said: "We are grateful for the opportunity to reflect and recognise that the performance was understandably distressing for some delegates and was experienced as particularly confronting for people from historically oppressed groups who have been impacted by slavery."</p>
      <p>“We also acknowledge that we could have consulted with the Minorities Group about our decision-making. </p>
      <p>“We now understand that, despite being a suitable anti-racist performance as part of Black History Month and for the International Slavery Museum, where there is trust in the intentions of the organisers, it was not suited to the nature or the timing of the GTiCP event.” </p>
      <p>The organisation, which represents 60,000 members, also apologised for failing to intervene during the performance to prevent members from becoming upset.</p>
      <p>It added: “As a predominantly white staff team, using our own feelings of shame and intense emotional discomfort as a guide to censor a powerful performance developed for Slavery Remembrance Day could have been viewed as unacceptable”. </p>
      <p>“We are sorry that we did not read the distress of some people in the room and act accordingly.” </p>
      <p>The performance, titled Remembering Slavery, was created by ‘Capoeira for All’, after the group was commissioned by the International Slavery Museum in 2017.</p>
      <p>The group said its performance had been taken “out of context” and that criticism fuelled by social media was “factually wrong and misrepresented what we aimed to achieve”. </p>
      <p>Akil Morgan, Capoeira for All's managing director, said: “Our ancestors, our family, were sold for profit and political power. </p>
      <p>This shameful truth is the reality of our past that we should not censor and in fact, we believe, should confront head on. </p>
      <p>"Our performance does this and asks the audience to face their relationship with the truth of this event. </p>
      <p>"If theatre and art censored itself to not portray painful and shameful elements of our history, it would not be the powerful medium it is."</p>
      <p>The group said it was planning to stage a repeat performance later this month in order for people to “make up their own mind” about it.</p>
