        <b>Michael McKillop says he'll use the disappointment of missing out on a medal today as inspiration ahead of next year's Paralympics in Toyko.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The four-time Paralympics gold medalist was fourth in today's T38 1500 metres final at the World Para Athletics Championships in Dubai.</p>
      <p>His time of 4:09.27 was just half a second outside of the medals and would have been a Championship record in his previous T37 class.</p>
      <p>The Ulster man was running in a major race for the first time since suffering a serious injury at the London games two years ago.</p>
      <p>"Before I came out here I prepared as best I can but I knew that I wouldn’t be able to go with the pace from a long distance out, <a href="https://www.paralympics.ie/news/2019/11/15/mckillop-returns-with-4th-placed-finish">McKillop told Paralympics Ireland's official website after the race.</a></p>

      <p>"I’ve just had 8 months in my legs, that’s it. So, if I can do that in another 8 months, another year or just below a year on top of this it will get me back in the medals and hopefully back on top of the podium but, again, tonight wasn’t my night, that’s sport for ya, the better people beat me."</p>
      <p>David Leavy came in 9th, running a personal best in the process.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Mary Fitzgerald finished seventh in the women's F40 Shot Put.</p>
