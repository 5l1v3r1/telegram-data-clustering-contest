      <h1>Adam Driver Compares His Upcoming Films and Recounts Incident in Which He Was Stalked by a Fan in Kylo Ren Garb</h1>

      <p><b>Adam Driver</b> is a busy guy, with his drama <i>Marriage Story</i> hitting theaters on December 6th and the conclusion of the <i>Star Wars</i> saga, <i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,</i> coming up just after on December 20th. <i>Marriage Story</i> stars driver and <b>Scarlett Johansson</b> as a couple with a child who are going through a painful divorce. The film tells both sides of the story, and it looks heavy and emotional. While I assume this <i>Star Wars</i> film will also be emotional for many, it really does seem like a very different film. But Driver opened up to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/adam-driver-star-wars-marriage-story-interview/">Total Film Magazine</a> and said he actually found his process of finding each of these characters to be very similar:</p>
      <blockquote>“In a way, Star Wars is a big blockbuster, which you would think would be maybe devoid of those conversations [about character]. But I haven’t found the process very dissimilar. You try to make Star Wars personal as much as anything else, and because J.J. [Abrams] was the director and because Rian Johnson was the director, it all came down to similar [things]… taking moments and breaking them into pieces and making sure you’re truthful.”</blockquote>
      <p>He went on to talk about the obvious differences in making a big blockbuster versus an intimate movie with a small cast:</p>
      <blockquote>“The obvious difference is the rhythm of a set. A Star Wars set, there are 50 people all doing individual jobs, whether it be special effects or brushing a leaf or vacuuming something. There are just so many more moving pieces that finding your footing in the rhythm of that set… it’s just longer.”</blockquote>
      <p>And not only is a big cast and crew an adjustment, but a franchise like <i>Star Wars</i> comes with a fandom unlike almost anything else out there. And with a fanbase like that, there are sure to be a few nuts in the tree. Driver said he was staying at a hotel once where he was being stalked by someone in a Kylo Ren costume:</p>
      <blockquote>“They were asking people in the elevator if they’d seen me! That makes you a little nervous.”</blockquote>
      <p>I can’t imagine having a level of fame like his. I’m already paranoid. While celebrities have fame and fortune, they lose anonymity and privacy, and that has got to be hard. I am really excited for both <i>Marriage Story</i> and <i>The Rise of Skywalker</i>, and I can’t wait to see what else Driver brings us in the future.</p>
