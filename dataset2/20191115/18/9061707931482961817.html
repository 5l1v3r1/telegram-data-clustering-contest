      <h1>Nigel Clough pulls no punches over FA Cup replay ruling</h1>
      <h2>FA are devaluing their own competition by forcing Brewers to play a weakened side, he says</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T18:39:43+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 18:39</time> by <a rel="author">Colston Crawford</a></address>
      <p>Nigel Clough has suggested the Football Association are “devaluing their own competition” by making Burton Albion play their first round replay against Salford City inside the current international break.</p>
      <p>The Brewers will be without internationals Liam Boyce (Northern Ireland), Kieran O’Hara (Republic of Ireland) and Nathan Broadhead (Wales) for the game, which the FA have said must go ahead on Tuesday, November 19.</p>
      <p>Following on from his initial comments on the decision, Brewers boss Clough elaborated on his criticism.</p>
      <p>“We’re all absolutely flabbergasted at the decision, to say the least,” said Clough. “The people who are running the competition are devaluing it, which is a contradiction.</p>
      <p>“For many years now the Premier League has been the be all and end all, the ‘product’ everyone wants to see, the one that brings all the money in for everybody, so you understand what’s at stake in that.</p>
      <p>“But they have been fighting against clubs putting out weakened sides in the FA Cup and it being devalued in that way and now they are insisting that we have to put out a weakened side.</p>
      <p>“They are basically saying that their own competition is not as important as the League.</p>
      <p>“Three days prior to the replay date, our League game has been cancelled because we have players away and we assumed the FA Cup game would follow suit. If they are of equal importance, you would assume that the same rules apply and you would be able to cancel the game. What we are learning is that they are not of the same importance.”</p>
      <p>Burton are annoyed in two other ways. They had flagged up the potential problem before the start of the season and again a few weeks ago, while Clough also thinks the FA appear to be unaware of how many internationals are now playing in the lower divisions.</p>
      <p>“It’s extremely frustrating, especially when this was known when the fixtures came out,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Nobody put anything in place to deal with that. We also talked to the FA two to three weeks ago and nothing was done about it. A good few years ago, there were no international players in League One and League Two. But there are eight League games called off this weekend in those divisions.</p>
      <p>“It’s pretty obvious that there are a few around now. It’s filtered down. There are international players of different nationalities and there are under-21s out on loan, like Nathan Broadhead with us. It’s not been taken into account at all.”</p>
      <p>Sunderland, who must go to Gillingham for their replay on the same night, missing four international players, are equally annoyed. The Black Cats are at home to Burton on Tuesday, November 26 and the two clubs wanted to put that game off and have their replays on that night.</p>
      <p>“There were lots of options for the Sunderland game,” said Clough. We are playing two fewer games with Bury not being involved now and we are both out of the Leasing.com Trophy, so there was another free date there.</p>
      <p>“They actually came up with a suggestion at one point that we could play the Sunderland League game on the Tuesday, the replay on the Thursday and the FA Cup second round on the Saturday if we got through. That’s what you’re dealing with.”</p>
      <p>The FA have admitted that their decision-making committee, the Professional Game Board, are “committed to reviewing the rules of the competition for future seasons with regard to such cases at its next meeting.”</p>
