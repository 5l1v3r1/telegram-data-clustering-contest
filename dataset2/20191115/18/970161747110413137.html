      <h1>Perrie Edwards all smiles as boyfriend Alex smashes England appearance</h1>

      <p>Perrie Edwards was all smiles after smashing the latest performance with her Little Mix bandmates.</p>
      <p>The Shout Out To My Ex singer is currently in Manchester as part of the band’s LM5 tour, which is coming to an end in London on 22 November.</p>
      <p>And the 26-year-old was spotted clutching adorable dog Hatchi as they made their way into the seriously swanky Hilton Hotel moments after getting off stage.</p>
      <p>She nailed the off-duty chic look in a black Little Mix hoodie and grey NASA tracksuit bottoms, completing her outfit with scuffed white trainers.</p>
      <p>We’re not entirely sure what put that grin on her face but we’re betting it had something to do with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/england-qualify-euro-2020-style-7-0-battering-montenegro-wembley-11147573/">seeing boyfriend Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain scoring a goal for England</a> in their game against Montenegro on Thursday.</p>
      <p>While Perrie wasn’t able to be in the crowd at Wembley – because of the aforementioned gig at Manchester Arena – she definitely would’ve kept an eye on that score throughout the night.</p>

      <p>The couple – dubbed Alerrie – started dating way back in 2016, and have been practically inseparable ever since.</p>

      <p>However, the Touch singer found herself on the wrong side of football fans recently after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/06/perrie-edwards-called-liverpool-fans-misspells-boyfriend-alex-oxlade-chamberlains-name-11050112/">she accidentally managed to spell her beau’s name wrong on Instagram</a>.</p>
      <p>Yes, seriously.</p>
      <p>The X Factor winner took a second to give the 26-year-old a shout-out following his winning goal for Liverpool in the Champions League.</p>
      <p>But she was clearly too excited about his big moment, as she added an extra ‘e’ onto her Instagram story.</p>

      <p>Quoting a chant about the footballer, she captioned it: ‘You to me are everything, my Alex Oxlade-Chamberlaine OH BABY OH BABEHHH!’</p>
      <p>Side note: Pezza decided to skip out the part of the song where supporters praise him for ‘s**gging Little Mix,’ which is understandable.</p>
      <p>While it is quite a catchy chant, unimpressed Liverpool fans called her out for the spelling mistake – with Alex even getting on the action.</p>
      <p>Noticing the slip-up, he screenshot it and shared it to his own story, joking: ‘Spell my name right at least will ya (sic).’</p>

      <p>She styled it out well, replying: ‘It’ll be way easier to spell when it’s my second name and I have to write it all the time.’</p>
      <p>Fair point.</p>
