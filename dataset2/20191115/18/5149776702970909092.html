      <p>No fireworks? No problem! Was the verdict given to this year's Nottingham Christmas light switch-on.</p>
      <p>Taking place at 4.30pm this afternoon (Friday, November 15), the traditional <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/winter-wonderland">Winter Wonderland </a>opening ceremony was down-sized from last year amid plans to invest more funds into the city's New Year's Eve celebrations.</p>
      <p>Starting earlier than usual (it was advertised as "just after dusk"), more than a hundred people gathered in Old Market Square to watch the festive fun which included four ice skating performances and carols.</p>
      <p>The more low-key nature of the event didn't seem to bother spectators, who praised the switch-on.</p>
      <p>"I know some cities have celebrities or fireworks but that doesn't matter," said Adam Greaves, 30, of Radford, "It's all about the atmosphere and the atmosphere was perfect."</p>

      <p>Chole Dixon, 20, of Basford, agreed. She said: "It was absolutely beautiful. It really helps marks the start of Christmas."</p>
      <p>Kyaan Johnson, 22, of Basford, added: "I really liked it. I didn't know it was happening but saw people gathering. I'm glad I caught it."</p>
      <p>The lights, tree, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/whats-on-news/nottingham-winter-wonderlands-ice-rink-3543239">ice rink</a> and bars will remain outside the council house until New Year's Day.</p>
      <p>Councillor Dave Trimble, portfolio holder for leisure and culture, said: “Winter Wonderland is a fantastic attraction with something for visitors of all ages and is regularly ranked amongst the top Christmas markets in the UK, most recently in Vogue magazine.</p>
      <p>"We are pleased to welcome so many people to the city centre and to show off the Old Market Square in its best light, giving Nottingham’s retail, leisure and hotel sectors a real boost in the run up to Christmas, right up to New Year’s Eve.”</p>
