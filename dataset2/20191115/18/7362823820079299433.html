      <p>The latest season will revolve around <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnn-jeffrey-toobin-ambassador-bill-taylor-george-kent">Jeffrey Toobin</a>’s bestselling book, “A Vast Conspiracy: The Real Story of the Sex Scandal That Nearly Brought Down a President.”</p>
      <p>Toobin’s book, “The Run of His Life: The People v. O.J. Simpson” was used as a basis for the first season of the anthology series.</p>
      <p>In an interview <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/american-horror-story-season-10-spoilers-ryan-murphy-ahs-1984-interview-season-finale-ratched-hollywood-streaming-dates-1202785704/">with Deadline</a>, producer Ryan Murphy stated, “We do a show that is very thoroughly fact-checked and vetted and based on the best-selling book by Jeffrey Toobin.”</p>
      <p>“I think the reason why it’s interesting is because you don’t have to change anything to feel modern. And I think that idea of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry">impeachment</a> obviously with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">[Donald] Trump</a> is fascinating. I wouldn’t say that we’re changing things that much or mentioning Trump at all in our narrative.”</p>
