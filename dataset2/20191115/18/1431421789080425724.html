      <h1>Despite Israel, U.S. Pressure, and Ongoing Probe, UN Renews UNRWA Mandate</h1>
      <h2>The Palestinian refugee agency, which recently lost its chief amid misconduct allegations, received overwhelming support at the General Assembly</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T18:30:37+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 18:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.haaretz.com/misc/writers/WRITER-1.4969059" target="_blank">Noa Landau</a></address>
      <p>The United Nations General Assembly Fourth Committee renewed the mandate of the agency tasked with supporting Palestinian refugees on Friday, in an overwhelming show of support amid an investigation of its former chief, accused of misconduct.</p>
      <p>Only Israeli and American representatives on the committee voted against the resolution, with Canada, Cameroon, Guatemala, Vanuatu, Micronesia, Marshall Islands and Nauru abstaining. Another 170 nations voted for renewing the mandate.</p>

      <p>A final vote on another three-year extension to UNRWA's mandate, until 2023, is expected later this month at the General Assembly.</p>
      <p>The decision comes after a long campaign by Israel and the United States against the organization, on grounds that it justifies the claim that Palestinians are refugees who could potentially exercise their right of return to Israel, thus preventing a practical solution to the conflict.</p>
      <p>UNRWA, which was created in 1949 and is one of the organization's oldest agencies, has faced an unprecedentedly rocky period in its history in the past few years. </p>

      <p>In 2018, the Trump administration <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/palestinians/.premium-trump-administration-announces-end-to-financial-aid-for-unrwa-1.6433942">cut the U.S.'s contribution to UNRWA's budget</a>, sending the agency into financial turmoil. It remained afloat only after <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/donors-pledge-113-million-to-help-palestinian-refugees-1.7411168">European and Arab countries managed to plug the gap</a>.</p>
      <p>Over the last few months, allegations of misconduct in the top echelons of the organization have <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/palestinians/swiss-dutch-suspend-funds-for-un-aid-agency-for-palestinians-over-graft-scandal-1.7608295">thrown UNRWA into further disarray</a>, leading to <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/unrwa-chief-steps-down-pending-misconduct-inquiry-1.8089555">the resignation of the agency’s commissioner general, Pierre Krahenbuhl</a>.</p>
      <p>The veteran diplomat jumped before being pushed, as circumstances surrounding the UN internal investigation, which started in March 2019, became public. Prior to his resignation, a UN spokesman said preliminary findings excluded “fraud or misappropriation of operational funds,” and noted that the allegations were likely connected to personal misbehavior.</p>
