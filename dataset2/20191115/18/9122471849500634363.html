      <h1>NFL Insider Announces Punishment For Steelers QB Mason Rudolph</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T18:48:11+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 18:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>Earlier this morning, the <a href="https://thespun.com/nfl/afc-north/cleveland-browns/nfl-announces-suspensions-for-myles-garrett-maurkice-pouncey-larry-ogunjobi">NFL announced suspensions for players involved in a fight</a> during the final seconds of Thursday night’s game between the Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers.</p>
      <p>Myles Garrett received an indefinite suspension – for at least the rest of the 2019 season, including playoffs. The suspension comes as a result of Garrett using Mason Rudolph’s helmet as a weapon against the Steelers quarterback.</p>
      <p>Rudolph did not receive a suspension for his part in the altercation. The NFL announced “additional discipline for other players will be forthcoming.”</p>
      <p>It didn’t take long for that punishment to come out.</p>
      <p>According to a report from NFL insider Tom Pelissero, the Steelers quarterback will receive a fine for his actions on the field.</p>
      <p>The NFL will fine Steelers QB Mason Rudolph for his role in last night’s brawl, I’m told,” Pelissero reported.</p>

      <p>The amount of money remains to be seen, but Rudolph won’t get away unpunished. He wasn’t the only member of the Steelers to be punished for his actions Thursday night.</p>
      <p>Pittsburgh offensive lineman Maurkice Pouncey received a three-game suspension for punching and kicking Garrett after he hit Rudolph with the helmet.</p>
      <p>Pittsburgh and Cleveland won’t have to wait long to see each other again. The two teams face off in Pittsburgh on December 1.</p>
