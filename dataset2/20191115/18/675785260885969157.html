      <h1>General Election: Nigel Farage humiliated as Brexit Party candidates do not stand in scores of seats</h1>
      <h2>Mr Farage said he would stand against Labour MPs across the country - but they didn't manage to get candidates everywhere</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T18:22:20+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 18:22</time> by <a rel="author">Oliver Milne, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/oliver-milne/</a></address>
      <p>Nigel Farage's Brexit Party are not standing in scores of seats currently held by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> and Remain supporting MPs - despite threatening to stand against every single one.</p>
      <p>Mr Farage said his party would stand all across the UK, except in the 317 seats where he decided to stand down for the Conservatives or in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>It appears the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> Party will stand in 276 seats in the contest - slightly below the 300 the party were hoping for.</p>
      <p>But earlier this week Mr Farage said of Labour: "We’re going to stand against every single one of them.”</p>
      <p>Two of Mr Farage’s candidates in Labour held seats, Dudley North hopeful Rupert Lowe and Andy Wood, who was due to fight Hove, withdrew just before the 4pm deadline for nominations - citing fears of splitting the Leave vote.</p>

      <p>It came after the Mr Farage alleged that Boris Johnson's party of “political corruption” claiming that Downing St had offered Brexit Party candidates peerages not to stand in the election.</p>

      <p>Following Mr Lowe's withdrawal Mr Farage cancelled an appearance in Dudley.</p>
      <p>Mr Farage accused Mr Lowe, who is a sitting Brexit Party MEP,  of "disgusting" behaviour in pulling out as a candidate at the 11th hour.</p>
      <p>The former Southampton FC chairman's actions prevented the Brexit Party fielding a replacement candidate in the seat, which Ian Austin won for Labour by a 22-vote margin in 2017.</p>
      <p>After breaking off from a chat with drinkers at the Wellington Inn, Mr Farage said Mr Lowe's move had not been sanctioned by the party.</p>

      <p>"It was disgusting behaviour," Mr Farage said. "What he probably hasn't told you is that he met a senior official from Number 10 in the middle of last week, somebody quite close to Boris, and this was obviously stitched up.</p>
      <p>"If he made a decision, he went and changed course, he's entitled to. But to let everybody else down at the eleventh hour, dreadful behaviour - shocking."</p>
      <p>Asked for his message for party supporters in Dudley North, Mr Farage added: "I'm sorry - we have been double-crossed, let down badly by a man who has behaved dishonestly. I'm sorry, that's all I can say."</p>
      <p>In a tweet which coincided with Thursday's 4pm deadline, Mr Lowe, who was elected as one of three West Midlands Brexit Party MEPs earlier this year, tweeted: "I am putting country before party as it is highly conceivable my candidacy could allow Corbyn's</p>
      <p>The Conservatives denied the allegations nade by Mr Farage.</p>
      <p>A Conservative source said: "Nigel cant deliver Brexit, but he could end up blocking it.</p>
      <p>“His outburst is a result of this fact dawning on him.”</p>
