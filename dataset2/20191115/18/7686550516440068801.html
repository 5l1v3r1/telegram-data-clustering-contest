      <h2>The BBC is looking at making around 16 staff in Wales redundant</h2>

      <p>Around 16 BBC staff in Wales are proposed for redundancy as part of a cost-cutting programme affecting factual departments across the UK.</p>
      <p>Workers at the broadcaster’s Roath Lock studios in Cardiff were told the news on Friday.</p>
      <p>Affected staff work on The One Show, Crimewatch Roadshow, Bargain Hunt, Weatherman Walking and X-Ray.</p>
      <p>One member of staff affected by the cuts said: “Some people are very upset indeed. This came as a shock.”</p>
      <p>Another said: “When will this cyclical torture end? There’s no security in employment any more. This has happened before Christmas, out of the blue at short notice.</p>
      <p>“It seems that around 16 staff on contracts will be going – mainly more senior staff such as producers and assistant producers and series producers.</p>
      <p>"There are many more staff there working on the programmes but they tend to be on short term contracts or are freelancers.</p>
      <p>"Essentially it seems that BBC Studios wants to get rid of as many contract staff as they can.”</p>
      <p>BBC Studios Production is a wholly-owned commercial subsidiary of the BBC and has bases in Cardiff, London, Manchester and Bristol.</p>
      <p>Job losses have been announced at all the centres but Cardiff is understood by local employees to have taken the hardest hit.</p>
      <p>A BBC spokeswoman said: “BBC Studios Production is proposing to make some changes to its Factual Entertainment &amp; Events and Entertainment &amp; Music departments and move to a more flexible operating model, in line with other parts of BBC Studios Production and the wider industry.</p>
      <p>"This will deliver efficiencies and ensure the business is the right size and shape to create and manage growth.</p>
      <p>"A number of roles are expected to close and some new roles are being created. It is anticipated that around 50 staff are expected to leave the business in total.</p>
      <p>“As part of the changes, BBC Studios Production is strengthening its creativity and presence in the nations and regions, by investing in new senior editorial and leadership roles outside of London, including creative directors in Cardiff, Glasgow and Bristol and base leaders in Cardiff and Glasgow.</p>
      <p>"This reflects BBC Studios Production’s commitment to representing diverse voices from around the UK and its ambition to grow this part of the business.</p>
      <p>“We recognise these changes will be difficult for those impacted and we are consulting with staff and unions to ensure they are fully supported throughout the process.”</p>
      <p>The spokeswoman said that at this stage it would be inappropriate to be more specific about the jobs at risk.</p>
