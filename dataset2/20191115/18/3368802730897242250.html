      <p>There seems to be no stopping the spiralling prices of onion. Each kg of the essential spice was sold for Tk 240-260 in the capital yesterday and the prices kept rising by the hour.</p>
      <p>To boost supplies, the government will use cargo planes to import onion within the shortest possible time.</p>
      <p>“Through cargo planes, the TCB is importing onion from Turkey while S Alam Group from Egypt and many other companies from Afghanistan and the United Arab Emirates [are importing onion]. All procedures have already been completed,” BSS reports citing a commerce ministry release.</p>
      <p>Besides, a large consignment of onion will arrive at a sea port soon, it added.</p>
      <p>Onion prices began to rise about two months ago, when India restricted its onion export. But the prices started to rise sharply last week.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, each kg of locally grown onion was sold for Tk 100-120 in the kitchen markets in the capital. But the price jumped to Tk 160 on Tuesday morning and then kept rising.</p>
      <p>The prices rose by Tk 30 to 40 every day since Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The Daily Star yesterday visited six kitchen markets and several retail stores in the capital’s Karwan Bazar, Moghbazar, Farmgate, Mohammadpur, Kazipara and Shewrapara.</p>
      <p>Prices of some other essentials, including rice, some vegetables and soybean oil, also increased by Tk 5-10 in the last 10 days.</p>
      <p>A kg of fine rice was being sold for Tk 48-50 and coarse rice for Tk 33-35 yesterday.</p>
      <p>Besides, prices of bottled soybean oil rose by about Tk 5 a litre, and cauliflower by about Tk 10 apiece.</p>
      <p>“We can’t help eating onion because curries taste bad without it. But at the same time, we can’t afford it,” said Mohammad Khokon, a shopper in Karwan Bazar.</p>
      <p>Another shopper in Kazipara, Farid Uddin said, “We are buying as little goods as we can.”</p>
      <p>A few days ago, the Burmese variety of onion was cheaper by Tk 20-30 than the local variety, but the prices came quite close yesterday.</p>
      <p>The reporters found each kg of local onion was sold for Tk 240-260 at retail stores and Tk 230-240 at wholesale markets yesterday afternoon. The Burmese variety was cheaper by about Tk 10.</p>
      <p>The wholesalers and retailers blamed supply shortage for the price hike and said the prices may soar further unless India resumed exporting onion.</p>
      <p>“Importing onion from India was faster and easier. On the other hand, importing from Egypt and Myanmar takes a long time,” said Rezaul Karim, a wholesaler in Karwan Bazar.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, many retail stores in residential areas have stopped selling onion.</p>
      <p>“I stopped selling onion two weeks ago. Shoppers haggle too much,” said Jakir Hossain, a grocery store owner in Tejturi Bazar area.</p>
      <h3>PRICES MAY FALL SOON</h3>
      <p>Senior Awami League lawmaker Tofail Ahmed at a relief distribution programme in Bhola yesterday said the prices of onion “will become normal soon” as around 50,000 tonnes of imported onion will reach the country.</p>
      <p>“Different countries are facing onion crisis this year,” said the chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Ministry of Commerce.</p>
      <p>At another programme in the capital’s Dhanmondi, AL General Secretary Obaidul Quader said, “We are trying to identify those responsible for the price hike. I hope that the prices will come down soon.”</p>
