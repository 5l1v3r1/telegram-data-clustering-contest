      <h1>Two German students arrested for 'unlawful assembly' over Hong Kong protests</h1>

      <p>Two German students were arrested in Hong Kong for "unlawful assembly" linked to ongoing unrest in the city, police said early Saturday.</p>
      <p>The students, aged 22 and 23, were arrested on Thursday for suspected participation in an illegal assembly, police said.</p>
      <p>Police did not release their identities but said the 22-year-old also faces charges of violating Hong Kong's anti-mask regulation.</p>
      <p>In Berlin, the German foreign ministry confirmed the arrests but also did not release their identities or mention the charges.</p>
      <p>"Our consulate in Hong Kong is providing consular care to those affected and is in contact with a lawyer and local authorities," a ministry source told AFP.</p>
      <p>According to Germany's mass market Bild newspaper, citing unnamed Hong Kong activists, the two are exchange students at Hong Kong's Lingnan University.</p>
      <p>Lingnan -- formerly Lingnan College -- "is the only public liberal arts university in Hong Kong," according to the university's website.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong has seen relentless protests since June as many in the city of 7.5 million people have vented fury at eroding freedoms under Chinese rule.</p>
      <p>Universities have become a hub for the protesters -- the first time a movement characterised by its fluidity and unpredictability has coagulated in fixed locations.</p>
      <p>Violence has escalated, and tensions have spilt out overseas, sparking friction between China and Britain, which governed Hong Kong until 1997.</p>
