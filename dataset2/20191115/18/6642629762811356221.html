      <p><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/india.html">India</a>'s federal investigation agency, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), has raided the local offices of human rights group <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/amnesty-international.html">Amnesty International</a> in an investigation into alleged violations of foreign funding rules.</p>
      <p>"It was alleged that the provision of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act 2010 and Indian Penal Code were contravened," the CBI said in a statement, adding that the Indian arm received contributions from Amnesty International in the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-kingdom.html">United Kingdom</a> despite government restrictions.</p>
      <p>The raids were conducted at Amnesty International's offices in Bengaluru and New Delhi after the CBI registered a case against the group based on a complaint from India's Ministry of Home Affairs, the statement added.</p>
      <p>Amnesty International, which has criticised some actions of Prime Minister <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/narendra-modi-141021134051524.html">Narendra Modi</a>'s government in the past, was also accused of violations of foreign funding rules last year.</p>
      <h3>'Pattern of harassment'</h3>
      <p>"Over the past year, a pattern of harassment has emerged every time Amnesty International India stands up and speaks out against human rights violations in India," the group said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Amnesty International accused Modi's government of violating human rights in Indian-administered <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/issues/kashmir.html">Kashmir</a> after it revoked the constitutional autonomy of the disputed state in August and came down heavily on protesters in the aftermath.</p>
      <p>The rights group also criticised the government's recent move to <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/india-revokes-writer-taseer-citizenship-card-status-191108083910699.html">revoke </a>the overseas Indian citizenship of British writer Aatish Taseer, calling it "discrimination based on gender and ethnic or national origin".</p>
      <p>India has tightened surveillance of non-profit organisations in the country since Modi took power in 2014, with thousands of civil society groups having their licences to receive foreign donations cancelled or suspended.</p>
      <p>India's financial crime investigating agency, the Enforcement Directorate (ED), froze bank accounts of environmental watchdog Greenpeace India last year, forcing the organisation to cut its staff to a bare minimum.</p>
      <p>Amnesty International India's <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/10/indian-officials-raid-amnesty-international-regional-office-181025154904783.html">office was raided</a> and its bank accounts were frozen by the ED last year.</p>
