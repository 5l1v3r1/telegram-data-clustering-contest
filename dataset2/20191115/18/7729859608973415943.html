      <p>The pair join Stephen Jones, Jonathan Humphreys and Neil Jenkins in Pivac's coaching team.</p>
      <p>"I'm delighted to bring both Byron and Sam into the set-up and add to what is already a vastly experienced coaching team," said Pivac.</p>
      <p>"Both individuals are highly respected, knowledgeable and experienced in their disciplines and will add a great deal to the environment.</p>
      <p>"Byron has a great coaching CV with experience in England, the club game in Wales, the age-grade system and his five successful years with the Scarlets.</p>

      <p>"Sam is one of the most experienced leaders in rugby with excellent knowledge and communication skills and having only recently retired he has a full grasp on the international game.</p>
      <p>"We looked at the coaching structure and the roles of each coach and believed by adding a second defensive role into the team adds value, adds a point of difference and allows a specialist to work in the contact area and I believe Byron and Sam will compliment each other in the roles."</p>
      <p>Warburton won 74 caps for Wales and captained the British and Irish Lions on two overseas tours.</p>

      <p>"I'm delighted to be part of the senior national coaching team," said Warburton. "It is a genuine privilege to be considered for such a role and I can't wait to do my upmost to contribute to help improve the team and players.</p>
      <p>"With such a great group of players and management it is an amazing opportunity which I am very proud to be given."</p>
      <p>Former Scarlets defence coach Hayward added: "I'm very proud and can't wait to get stuck in and work with the cream of Welsh rugby.</p>
      <p>"I appreciate the privileged position I'm in and I'm looking forward to getting going with the squad and building on the good work that has been done before.</p>
      <p>"Wayne has put together a coaching team with a wealth of experience and knowledge and it will bring variety on and off the field and I'm excited about what lies ahead."</p>
