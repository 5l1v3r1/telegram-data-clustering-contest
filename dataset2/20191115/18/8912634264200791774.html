      <p>There is nothing more relaxing than grabbing a paint brush, letting your imagination flow and expressing your emotions on an empty canvas while sipping your favorite coffee.<br/>Arty Cafe allows you to do just that, making it a perfect place to unwind after a long day at work.<br/>The cafe has art supplies ranging from coloring pencils to acrylic paints and brushes of all sizes.<br/>The atmosphere, lighting, music and a room full of passionate artists encouraged me to take up painting as a hobby.<br/>Aside from the colorful platform it offers artists in Jeddah, the cafe’s coffee and desserts are well worth trying. I recommend their iced Spanish latte.<br/>Arty Cafe is located in Al-Shatea district and is open Saturday-Thursday from 11:30 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. and from 5 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. on Fridays.</p>
