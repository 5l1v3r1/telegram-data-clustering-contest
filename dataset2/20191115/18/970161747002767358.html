      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/reese-witherspoon/">Reese Witherspoon</a> turned down the chance to appear on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/friends-tv-show/">Friends</a> for a second time because she didn’t like performing in front of a live studio audience.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/31/the-morning-show-review-ignore-the-backlash-and-devour-jennifer-anistons-performance-at-the-first-available-opportunity-11020763/">The Morning Show</a> actress was being interviewed with her co-star (and one-time on-screen sister!) <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jennifer-aniston/">Jennifer Aniston</a> when she revealed for the first time that she had been asked back for a second stint on the iconic sitcom.</p>
      <p>In the sitcom, Reese played Jill Green, the spoiled younger sister of Aniston’s character Rachel.</p>
      <p>Both actresses were discussing performing in front of live audiences when the Legally Blonde star made the shock confession.</p>
      <p>‘She’s so good in front of a live audience,’ Aniston said of Witherspoon. ‘You forget it because you blacked out from fear.’</p>
      <p>‘I’ve never done it again,’ Witherspoon confirmed, before adding: ‘Did you know they asked me back?</p>

      <p>‘They asked me back and I said I couldn’t do it…I was too scared!’</p>
      <p>Jennifer seemed genuinely shocked (and dare we say a little bit disappointed?) at the news, hinting that if she had returned, Witherspoon could have learned to love performing in front of a live crowd.</p>
      <p>‘What a shame!’ she responded. ‘You would have started to love it.’</p>

      <p>She may have loved seeing Jill return, but we can’t say the same for Rachel, who was more than a bit miffed at her younger sister trying to date her on-again-off-again beau Ross. even going so far as telling her she ‘couldn’t have’ him.</p>
      <p>Everyone say it together now:</p>
      <p>‘Can’t have? The only thing I can’t have is dairy!’</p>
      <p>Currently starring in leading roles for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/01/apple-tv-plus-what-is-it-how-to-get-it-and-how-much-does-it-cost-11020089/">Apple TV+</a>’s inaugural drama The Morning Show, the pair have at least managed to reunite on-screen, and it’s even set in New York!</p>
      <p>In fact, we loved the first few episodes of the first season, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/31/the-morning-show-review-ignore-the-backlash-and-devour-jennifer-anistons-performance-at-the-first-available-opportunity-11020763/">telling everyone to ‘devour’ Aniston’s powerful performance</a> as news anchor Alex Levy.</p>
      <p>For all the Friends fanatics out there too, all hope is not yet lost for a reunion. Apparently, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/friends-reunion-special-works-hbo-max-couldnt-anymore-excited-11088205/">a reunion featuring all five core cast members</a> is in the works at HBO Max.</p>
