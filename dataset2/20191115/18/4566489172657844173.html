      <h1>50,000 migrants expelled from Istanbul since July</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T18:20:12+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 18:20</time> by <a rel="author">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Turkey said Friday it had expelled close to 50,000 migrants from Istanbul, including more than 6,000 Syrians, since the start of a crackdown on undocumented immigration.</p>
      <p>The Istanbul governor's office said 42,888 "illegal" migrants had been arrested and sent to repatriation centres with a view to removing them from Turkey, without giving their nationalities.</p>
      <p>It said 6,416 Syrians had been placed in "temporary refuge centres".</p>
      <p>A campaign from July through to the end of October was aimed at reducing the number of unregistered refugees in Turkey's biggest city and economic hub.</p>
      <p>The country hosts some 3.6 million Syrian refugees -- more than any other country -- though technically they are only under "temporary protection" because the government does not offer them formal refugee status.</p>
      <p>Under the system, they must stay in the province to which they were initially assigned, and can only visit other cities with short-term passes.</p>
      <p>Officials said in July that 547,000 Syrians were officially registered in Istanbul, and that no new registrations were being accepted.</p>
      <p>Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said at the time that the aim was to expel 80,000 undocumented migrants by the end of the year.</p>
      <p>Turkey has faced limited social problems despite the refugee influx from the eight-year conflict in its southern neighbour.</p>
      <p>But an economic downturn has sharpened tensions, and analysts say the refugee issue likely contributed to the ruling party's surprise defeat in the Istanbul mayoral election this year.</p>
      <p>President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has sought to defuse the issue with plans to create a "safe zone" in northern Syria to which refugees can return, though rights groups have cast doubt on the feasibility of the plan.</p>
      <p>Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International are among several groups to accuse Turkey of repatriating Syrian refugees against their will -- which the government has denied.</p>
