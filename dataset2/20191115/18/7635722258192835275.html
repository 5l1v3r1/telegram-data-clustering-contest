        <b>A long-time ally of Donald Trump has been found guilty of seven charges, including lying to US politicians, and now faces a potential lengthy jail term.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Roger Stone is the sixth adviser or aide to President Trump to be convicted in connection with the special counsel probe into Russian interference in the 2016 US election.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors say his lies related to WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange.</p>
      <p>On the second day of their deliberations, a jury in Washington DC today found Stone guilty of obstruction, witness tampering and lying to Congress.</p>
      <p>Stone had denied any wrongdoing, and claimed the case against him was politically motivated.</p>
      <p>He is due to be sentenced on 6th February.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/roger-stone-jury-weighs-evidence-and-a-defense-move-to-make-case-about-mueller/2019/11/15/554fff5a-06ff-11ea-8292-c46ee8cb3dce_story.html"><i>The Washington Post</i> reports</a></b> the charges could see a legal maximum penalty of 50 years - including 20 for witness tampering - but Stone is likely to face 'far less time' under sentencing guidelines.</p>
      <p>Shortly after the verdict, Donald Trump took to Twitter to claim the conviction illustrated a "double standard like never seen before in the history of our country" - listing around a dozen Democrats and other officials he has frequently targeted.</p>

      <p>67-year-old Stone has worked as a political lobbyist for decades, and has been involved in high-profile campaigns such as the Nixon campaign in 1972 and the early stages of the Trump campaign.</p>
      <p>Although he officially left the Trump presidential campaign in summer 2015, he has remained an outspoken supporter of the US president since Trump's election victory.</p>
      <p>Mr Stone had repeatedly <b><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/11/roger-stones-murky-relationship-wikileaks/574852/">faced questions</a></b> over whether he was in communication with Wikileaks over leaked documents from the Clinton campaign.</p>
