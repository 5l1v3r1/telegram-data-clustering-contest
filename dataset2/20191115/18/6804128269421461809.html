      <h1>From Lacazette to Gabriel Martinelli - How long each Arsenal player has left on their contracts</h1>
      <h2>The latest contract details on every member of the Arsenal first-team squad</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T18:30:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 18:30</time> by <a rel="author">Tashan Deniran-Alleyne</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal have already moved to tie down the future of wonderkid Joe Willock.</p>
      <p>The central midfielder was rewarded for an impressive pre-season with a new contract a month into the 2019/2020 campaign.</p>
      <p>And, he was delighted to have put pen-to-paper on a new deal.</p>
      <p>"To be at this club is amazing feeling and I've always wanted to play for the Arsenal first team," he told Arsenal.com.</p>
      <p>"Now I'm doing that, since the age of four and a half, it's always been my dream. And to sign a new contract today is a brilliant feeling for me and my family.</p>
      <p>"As a young boy growing up through the academy, I've always wanted to play at the Emirates and play in front of the fans and stuff. So to do it, it's only right in my heart and my mind to know that this is the right club for me. And to carry on my own future here is brilliant."</p>
      <p>The club have not revealed the length of the contract, only saying it is a "long-term" deal, but it is understood to run until 2023 and that means the Gunners don't have to worry too much about his future.</p>
      <p>In the past Arsenal have let players run down their contracts and thus missing out on decent transfer fees. But that has changed thanks to Head of Football Raul Sanllehi.</p>
      <p>With that said, here's when the contracts of every Arsenal first-team squad member runs out.</p>
      <h3>Goalkeepers</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Bernd Leno - 2023</b>
      </p>
      <p>The German goalkeeper signed last summer from Bayer Leverkusen.</p>
      <p>He is now the club's undisputed No.1 and inherited the squad number following Petr Cech's retirement.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Emiliano Martinez - 2022</b>
      </p>
      <p>Back at Arsenal after spending the second half of last season on loan at Reading.</p>
      <p>Behind Leno in the pecking order at the moment, needs to be patient for his chance but has said he's equal to the German stopper.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Matt Macey - 2020</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 25-year-old goalkeeper, he impressed during his loan spell at Plymouth during the 2018/19 season, making 38 appearances for the League One club. Unfortunately his performances weren't enough to stop the club suffering relegation.</p>
      <p>Is the third-choice stopper at the Emirates this season.</p>
      <h3>Defenders</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Hector Bellerin - 2023</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Spaniard signed a huge six-and-a-half year deal in 2016 having established himself as one of the most exciting young full-backs in world football.</p>
      <p>Was getting back to his best form under Emery before sustaining a bad knee injury against Chelsea in January.</p>
      <p>But has returned to action over the past couple of months and completed 90 minutes in the Premier League during the 2-0 defeat at Leicester City at the weekend.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Kieran Tierney - 2024</b>
      </p>
      <p>There's a lot of excitement regarding Tierney. If all goes well he could be the Gunners' first-choice left-back for the next decade at least.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sokratis - 2021</b>
      </p>
      <p>Signed from Borussia Dortmund in the summer of 2018, the Greek international joined the Gunners on a three-year deal.</p>
      <p>His father confirmed in an interview that Sokratis has the option of extending his contract by a further year.</p>
      <p>However, the player revealed last season that a future move to either China or the United States could be a real possibility.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>
        <b>Rob Holding - 2023</b>
      </p>
      <p>The young defender joined from Bolton in 2016 and ended his first season as a regular in the side, starting in the FA Cup final win against Chelsea.</p>
      <p>He earned rave reviews for his performances but struggled to replicate them during his second campaign in north London.</p>
      <p>Holding put pen-to-paper on a new deal in May 2018 and forced his way into Emery's plans until a serious knee injury away at Manchester United last December ended his 2018/2019 season.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Shkodran Mustafi - 2021</b>
      </p>
      <p>The German had a difficult start to life at Arsenal after arriving in 2016 and was told he could leave in the summer.</p>
      <p>Roma and Monaco were heavily linked but no move materialised and Mustafi has slipped down the pecking order this season.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Calum Chambers - 2022</b>
      </p>
      <p>The young England defender spent the 2018/19 season on loan with Fulham after previously spending the 2016/17 season on loan at Middlesbrough.</p>
      <p>Handed a new contract in October 2017, it came as a surprise in the summer when the ex-Southampton man was handed another new deal last July to extend his stay in the capital.</p>
      <p>
        <b>David Luiz - 2021</b>
      </p>
      <p>Following Laurent Koscielny's exit, the Gunners needed a direct replacement and brought in David Luiz from Chelsea.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian signed a short-term deal on deadline day with his contract expiring at the end of next season.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Konstantinos Mavropanos - 2023</b>
      </p>
      <p>Arsenal signed the young Greek defender from PAS Giannina in January 2018, he was the first player signed on the recommendation of former head of recruitment Sven Mislintat.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sead Kolasinac - 2022</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Bosnian defender joined on a free transfer from Schalke ahead of the 2017/18 season.</p>
      <p>Kolasinac has benefited from Nacho Monreal joining Real Sociedad but is facing competition from Tierney now that the Scotland international is fully fit.</p>

      <h3>Midfielders</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Mesut Ozil - 2021</b>
      </p>
      <p>The German international signed a contract extension in January 2018 after well over a year’s worth of negotiations.</p>
      <p>Ozil signed from Real Madrid in 2013 and is a hugely popular figure at the Emirates amongst fans, but his relationship with Emery was questioned last season.</p>
      <p>He is now the biggest earner at the club, with his deal said to be worth up to £350,000 a week.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Lucas Torreira - 2023</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Uruguay international sealed a move to the club in the summer of 2018 from Sampdoria after impressing in Serie A.</p>
      <p>The highly-rated midfielder penned a deal until 2023.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Ainsley Maitland-Niles - 2023</b>
      </p>
      <p>Having enjoyed a breakthrough season in 2017/18, the Arsenal academy product signed a new long-term deal at the Emirates last June.</p>
      <p>Maitland-Niles has been a regular on the right-hand side since Bellerin's injury and is expected to be a key figure for the club going forward, possibly in his favoured central midfield role.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>
        <b>Joe Willock - 2023</b>
      </p>
      <p>As mentioned above, Willock's new deal is understood to be running until 2023.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Matteo Guendouzi - 2022</b>
      </p>
      <p>The young Frenchman has made a huge impression since his move from Ligue 2 side Lorient.</p>
      <p>Joining Emery's side on a four-year deal, Guendouzi has the option of extending his deal by a further year.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Emile Smith Rowe - 2023</b>
      </p>
      <p>Smith-Rowe's time on loan at Bundesliga club RB Leipzig last season was hampered by injuries.</p>
      <p>Back at Arsenal this term, he will be looking to make an impression after signing a new long-term contract at the Emirates last summer.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Granit Xhaka - 2023</b>
      </p>
      <p>Arsenal signed Xhaka from Borussia Monchengladbach in 2016 and so far he has divided opinion at the Emirates.</p>
      <p>A regular in the team under Wenger and Emery, the Swiss international penned a new long-term deal in summer 2018.</p>
      <p>He could be on his way out in January after losing the captain's armband and has been linked to Newcastle United, AC Milan as well as a return to Germany.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Dani Ceballos - 2020</b>
      </p>
      <p>The midfielder's loan agreement expires at the end of the season and it appear that he will be returning to Real Madrid next summer.</p>

      <h3>Forwards</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Alexandre Lacazette - 2022</b>
      </p>
      <p>The French striker joined from Lyon in 2017 and was Arsenal’s club record signing before Aubameyang arrived in January 2018.</p>
      <p>Lacazette has become a very important player at the Emirates after netting some crucial goals.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang - 2021</b>
      </p>
      <p>Arsenal signed Aubameyang from Borussia Dortmund in January 2018, allowing Olivier Giroud to leave for Chelsea at the same time.</p>
      <p>The Gabon international has provided the goals that Arsenal lost when selling Alexis Sanchez to Manchester United.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Nicolas Pepe - 2024</b>
      </p>
      <p>Arsenal smashed their transfer record during the summer window to sign the Ivory Coast international from Lille in a deal that could be worth up to £72m.</p>
      <p>Fans will enjoy Pepe's prime years as he's signed until 2024.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Reiss Nelson - 2023</b>
      </p>
      <p>There is high hopes for Nelson at Arsenal, and he impressed in a loan spell at Bundesliga club Hoffenheim last season.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old spent the summer in Italy with the England U21 squad and started the opening two matches of the current campaign.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Gabriel Martinelli - 2024</b>
      </p>
      <p>Arsenal's first signing of the summer transfer window was the Brazilian wonderkid and he's signed a long-term contract.</p>
      <p>That's a good thing as Martinelli has made a huge impression when given a chance this season.</p>
      <h3>Loanees</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Mohamed Elneny - 2022</b>
      </p>
      <p>Elneny could join Besiktas permanently next summer for £16.3m.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Henrikh Mkhitaryan - 2021</b>
      </p>
      <p>There is no clause for Armenia international to join Roma permanently once his loan deal ends next summer, but doesn't appear to have a future at Arsenal.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Eddie Nketiah - 2022</b>
      </p>
      <p>Nketiah has signed a new "long-term" deal at Arsenal in December 2017. It's possible his contract runs out in 2022, although the Gunners will be keen to tie him down even longer.</p>
