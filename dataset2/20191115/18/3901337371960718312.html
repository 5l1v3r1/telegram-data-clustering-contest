      <p>According to Siya sources, Kaizer Chiefs are believed to be keeping a close eye on Richard Ofori, although there are at least five other players currently being linked to the Soweto side. </p>
      <p>Amakhosi made just five new additions in the previous July/August transfer window, while releasing more than 10 players from their books in the past year. </p>
      <p>Despite Chiefs currently flying high this season, as they sit comfortably at the top of the log, indications are that they could still be looking to bolster their squad further, specifically, in their goalkeeping department. </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>Siya sources have indicated that Chiefs are keeping a close eye on Maritzburg United’s Richard Ofori, all this while both Itumeleng Khune and Daniel Akpeyi will see their contracts come to an end on June 30, 2020. </p>
      <p>However, here are five  other players also being linked with a potential move to Chiefs.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Thabang Monare:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Siya sources have indicated in the past months that Chiefs were showing interest in Monare and with the player having rejected Bidvest Wits’ new contract offer, the Soweto side could look to revisit their interest in the player. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Sifiso Mbhele:</b>
      </p>
      <p>It is believed that Chiefs are one of the many clubs monitoring Mbhele from Highlands Park, with his performance this season not gone unnoticed. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Tshwarelo Bereng:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Chiefs were linked to Bereng in the past and according to Siya sources, Amakhosi is once again monitoring the midfielder. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Reyaad Pieterse and Ronwen Williams:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Both Pieterse and Williams made it on the list of potential goalkeeper targets for Amakhosi in the past months, with Siya sources recently indicating that while Chiefs are on the hunt to bolster their goalkeeping department, the Soweto side could rehash their interest in Pieterse. </p>
