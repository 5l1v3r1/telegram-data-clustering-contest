      <p>Nana Boroo’s threats come as a result of Shatta Wale and his gang assaulting his artist Kweku Smoke and breaking his neck and arm.</p>
      <p>Shatta Wale after the assault also used bricks to smash into Kweku Smoke’s car destroying it.</p>
      <p>This was because Kweku Smoke has accused Shatta Wake of stealing his song and twisting to make it appear it’s different.</p>
