      <p>We’re wrapping up the week with a roundup of the best paid iPhone and iPad apps we could find that are on sale for free for a limited time. We dug through hundreds of apps on Friday to come up with six in particular that are definitely worth checking out. They’re all free downloads only for a short amount of time, however, so grab them while you still can.</p>

        <i>This post covers paid iPhone and iPad apps that have been made available for free for a limited time by their developers. BGR is not affiliated with any app developers. There is no way to tell how long they will be free. These sales could end an hour from now or a week from now — obviously, the only thing we can guarantee is that they were free at the time this post was written. If you click on a link and see a price listed next to an app instead of the word “get,” it is no longer free. The sale has ended. If you download the app anyway, you will be charged by Apple. Some apps may have additional features that require in-app purchases. <a href="https://bgr.com/apps-on-sale/feed/">Subscribe to our RSS feed</a> or use that feed to <a href="https://ifttt.com/applets/147561p-rss-feed-to-email">create an email alert</a> so you’ll be notified as soon as these posts are published and avoid missing any sales.</i>
