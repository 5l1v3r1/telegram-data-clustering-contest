      <p>Indian corporate CFOs on Friday batted for <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/companies">companies </a>to digitise their financial functions at the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) Conclave 2019.</p>
      <p>"New business models are forcing <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/companies">companies </a>to innovate, adapt and transform for a digital customer first world. <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/artificial-intelligence">Artificial Intelligence </a>(AI) is no longer in the future, it is here and now," said Honeywell Automation Chairman Suresh Senapathy.</p>
      <p>Themed 'Tech CFOs', the one-day conclave featured chief financial officers from a wide variety of industries deliberating on the impact of technology and <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/digitisation">digitisation </a>on the traditional financial functions.</p>
      <p>Senapathy said that in an era of disruption where global forces are altering the way we work and live, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/companies">companies </a>which are only flexible, agile and adaptable will thrive.</p>
      <p>"CFOs cannot afford to spend the majority of their time on traditional financial functions. We need to leverage the vast flow of data that a digitised world is generating. It is no longer whether a company will be disrupted, it is when and how," said Senapathy.</p>
      <p>Pradip Kanakia, South India Price Waterhouse Coopers' managing partner and assurance leader, said a CFO in a company is best placed to drive the organisation's digital transformation.</p>
      <p>"They have touch points with every function in the organisation, they know the systems, they know the processes and they understand the business," said Kanakia.</p>
      <p>However, he pointed that a traditional CFO's role and responsibility remains as it is without any dilution.</p>
      <p>A CFO has to step-up and drive transformation in a business by harnessing digital power for creating differentiating capabilities, he said.</p>
      <p>According to MTR Foods CFO Ganesh Shenoy, CFOs should serve as change agents with a foresight to incorporate technology.</p>
      <p>"<a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/digitisation">Digitisation </a>is now a realistic goal for the finance function because of a range of technological advances," said Shenoy.</p>
