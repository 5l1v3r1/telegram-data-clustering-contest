      <h2>The district has so far received over 750mm rainfall</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T18:25:44+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 18:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Karthik-Madhavan-391/" target="_blank">Karthik Madhavan</a></address>
      <p>Coimbatore has received more rainfall this year than the long-term average (last 50 years). Data shared by the Agro Climate Research Centre at the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University showed that in 2019, the district had so far received over 750mm rainfall, which was over 80mm more than the long-term average of 674mm.</p>
      <p>Coimbatore received the 674mm rainfall in four seasons – winter (January, February), summer (March – May), South West Monsoon (June-September) and North East Monsoon (October – December).</p>
      <p>Last year, Coimbatore had received 845mm rainfall and this year could be a repetition, said the Centre’s head SP. Ramanathan.</p>
      <p>In the winter rainfall season, the district received zero rainfall, in summer it was 101.4mm, South West Monsoon 308.1 and in the current North East Monsoon season it had thus far received 341.7mm.</p>
      <p>With another 45 days left for the end of the North East Monsoon season, the Centre’s prediction was that the district could receive 70 – 80mm rainfall, he said.</p>
      <p>The district had received the 750mm rainfall this year in 46 rainy days. A day that sees more than 2.50mm rainfall is a rainy day.</p>
      <p>In the long-term average period – 50 years – the district had received excess rainfall in 25 years. The highest rainfall was in 1979 – 1,299 mm and the lowest was in 1974, 285.4mm, he added.</p>
      <h3>Dengue cases</h3>
      <p>One of the impacts of the rainfall is stagnation of fresh water and that turning into mosquito breeding sources. Coimbatore Corporation and hospital sources said that in November so far, the city had recorded 20 dengue-positive cases, but this was less than the last few years.</p>
      <p>The Corporation had deployed 12 officials for each of the 100 wards to destroy mosquito breeding sources and minimise dengue fever cases.</p>
      <p>The Corporation had also identified dengue hotspots – areas with more than three dengue cases or more fever cases – to concentrate its work there.</p>
      <h3>Domestic breeding checkers</h3>
      <p>At present, the officials and domestic breeding checkers were engaged in such active work in Ganapathy, Avarampalayam, Vadavalli, Telugupalayam and a few other places.</p>
