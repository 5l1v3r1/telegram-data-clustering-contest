      <p>TORONTO — Sidewalk Labs has released a 482-page document detailing its plans for a development on Toronto's waterfront.</p>
      <p>The so-called Digital Innovation Appendix works in part to alleviate some of the privacy concerns that have swirled around the project since it was first proposed in October 2017.</p>
      <p>The document from the Google sister company outlines several "innovations" — ranging from weather-responsive heated pavement to pedestrian detectors at crosswalks — and what data they will collect.</p>
      <p>It also reiterates the company's commitment that Waterfront Toronto, an agency composed of representatives from three levels of government, will take the lead on data governance.</p>
      <p>The decision to relinquish control of the data was an about-face for Sidewalk, which had previously proposed the establishment of a new agency to manage data from the project.</p>
      <p>Waterfront Toronto approved that change last month, along with a reduced scope for the project.</p>
      <p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 15, 2019.</p>
