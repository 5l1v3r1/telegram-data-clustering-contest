      <h1>DRI seizes blank KU mark lists from gold smuggler</h1>
      <h2>Govt. likely to refer case to Crime Branch</h2>

      <p>The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) has informed the government that it had confiscated purported Kerala University mark lists and official university seals from the custody of a suspected gold smuggler, Vishnu Somasundaram.</p>
      <p>In a communique to the Principal Secretary, Higher Education, the DRI said the mark lists were blank.</p>
      <h3>House raided</h3>
      <p>The DRI had raided the house of the accused in connection with its probe into the illegal import of gold in trade quantities through the international airport here.</p>
      <p>The agency had also arrested a senior Air Customs officer on the charge of helping the collaborators of a Dubai-based smuggling ring dodge duty on imported bullion by allowing the carriers to pass unchallenged through the airport checkpost. The government was likely to refer the case to the Crime Branch, which was investigating matters related to illegal diversion of KU answer sheets and a Public Service Commission (PSC) examination fraud.</p>
      <p>The CB had investigated Somasundaram in connection with the death of violinist Balabhaskar in a car accident last year.</p>
      <p>The musician had briefly employed the suspect, who had accompanied him on a few foreign tours.</p>
      <h3>Slack procedures</h3>
      <p>The KU had recently drawn flak for slack examination procedures following the seizure of answer sheets from the possession of Student Federation of India (SFI) leaders accused of stabbing a fellow party activist in University College.</p>
      <p>The police had found the answer sheets from the house of one of the suspects. They later found another bundle from the auditorium of the college.</p>
      <p>A senior official said the police would verify whether the mark lists were originals or clever forgeries. If they are found to be genuine, the police would investigate their provenance.</p>
