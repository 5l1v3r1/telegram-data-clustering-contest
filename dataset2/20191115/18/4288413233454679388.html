      <p>One of Sigma’s most anticipated lenses for the full-frame Sony E-Mount cameras has an official price tag, and it’s shockingly affordable. The <a href="https://petapixel.com/2019/11/06/sigma-unveils-the-24-70mm-f-2-8-art-full-frame-mirrorless-lens/">recently announced</a> Sigma 24-70mm f/2.8 Art lens—a direct competitor to Sony’s expensive 24-70mm f/2.8 G Master—will begin shipping in early December for just $1,100.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.adorama.com/l/?searchinfo=sigma+24-70mm+f%2f2.8+dg+dn&amp;kbid=67085">The Sigma 24-70mm f/2.8 DG DN Art</a>—which is designed from the ground up for full-frame mirrorless cameras—will be available for both the Sony E-Mount and Sigma/Panaasonic/Leica’s own L-mount, but it’s gotten the most attention from Sony a7 series users who want a native 24-70mm f/2.8 lens for less than the (admittedly exceptional) <a href="https://www.adorama.com/iso2470gm.html?kbid=67085">$2,200 Sony 24-70mm f/2.8 GM</a>. The main third-party alternative, up until now, has been the even-more-affordable <a href="https://www.adorama.com/tm2875soe.html?kbid=67085">Tamron 28-75mm f/2.8 Di III RXD</a>, but that’s not a true 24-70.</p>
      <p>To that end, Sigma just delivered in spades. With a price tag of just $1,100, it’s literally <i>half</i> the price of Sony’s G Master lens, while promising to deliver the kind of pro-grade performance and build quality that’s become synonymous with the Art series of Sigma lenses. For L-Mount shooters, it’s also half the price of <a href="https://www.adorama.com/pcs2470.html?kbid=67085">Panasonic’s LUMIX 24-70mm f/2.8 S Pro lens</a>.</p>
      <p>To learn more about this lens, head over to <a href="https://www.sigmaphoto.com/24-70mm-f2-8-dg-dn-a">the Sigma website</a> or go ahead and <a href="https://www.adorama.com/l/?searchinfo=sigma+24-70mm+f%2f2.8+dg+dn&amp;kbid=67085">pre-order yours here.</a> Sigma says this lens will ship in “early December,” so expect some real-world tests and comparisons to start pouring in very soon.</p>
