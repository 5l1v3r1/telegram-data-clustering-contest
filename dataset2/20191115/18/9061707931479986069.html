      <h1>How Brewers have had 11 players on treatment table of late</h1>
      <h2>Quinn getting back to speed now but physio is still a busy man</h2>

      <p>Every football club has injuries, of course they do. At every club, there will be two or three players who are working on that lonely, laborious journey back from a long-term injury, as Ben Fox and Callum Hawkins are doing at Burton Albion.</p>
      <p>There will be another group of players in and out of the physio’s room at any club with a variety of niggles.</p>
      <p>But as the Brewers head towards an FA Cup replay against Salford City on Tuesday with a string of injuries to accompany the fact that three players are absent on international duty, it could be said that they are having a particularly unfortunate time of it of late.</p>
      <p>Whenever there is a spate of injuries at Burton, there are rumblings on the various social media channels that they must be doing something wrong in training or preparation. I don’t buy that at all. Clubs have injuries, it happens.</p>
      <p>I think the Brewers have been especially unlucky in recent times, from the point that Liam Boyce, newly signed for the first campaign in the Championship, came out of a nothing situation in a pre-season friendly against Shrewsbury Town with a ruptured cruciate ligament in his knee which kept him out for almost all of that season. That both Hawkins, in training, and Fox, in a pre-season friendly against Matlock Town in July, have succumbed to similar injuries since is only a matter of misfortune, not preparation or fitness.</p>
      <p>While Boyce’s injury disrupted the season because he was the record signing and a striker, Fox’s was pretty crucial, too. The 21-year-old Academy graduate was destined to have played a big role this season.</p>
      <p>Anyone who saw his mature, composed, combative performance in last season’s 4-0 win away to Rochdale last season will know. Marcus Harness scored a hat-trick and walked away with the main plaudits but Fox was immaculate at right-back. I heard someone say “future Burton Albion captain” and did not feel inclined to disagree.</p>
      <p>The best thing about Hawkins’ and Fox’s injuries is that they still have so much of their careers ahead of them and we can hope to see Fox back in the side before the end of the season.</p>
      <p>There has been more bad luck in recent times, too. It is not likely that Luke Varney was going to set the world on fire when he arrived from Ipswich Town but, on his debut, in an FA Cup tie away to Watford, he challenged goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon, whose knee crashed into his back. He punctured a lung and broke a rib. No blame was attached to Pantilimon.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>At least when Varney returned he made the notable contribution of scoring the goal away to Barnsley which confirmed Burton’s survival in the first Championship season.</p>
      <p>Last season, although the injury was less serious, David Templeton found himself in a similar situation. After challenging for a header against Accrington Stanley, a defender landed on the Scottish winger, causing a shoulder injury. Templeton is probably the unluckiest player on the staff in terms of injuries. Ankle, calf and knee, the last requiring an operation, have all troubled him during his time with Burton.</p>
      <p>By contrast, Lukas Akins barely misses a game and is frequently referred to by manager Nigel Clough as the fittest player at the club. Why Templeton should have a string of injuries, while Akins has none, is a conundrum but it does not mean that Templeton is doing things wrong in training or not working as hard as Akins.</p>
      <p>It’s unfortunate for him but the simple fact is that we are all different. Some are luckier than others with injuries, some are just naturally more susceptible to them.</p>
      <p>It applies to all walks of life. I have, touch wood, never broken a bone in my body in 60 years on the planet but I know people half my age who’ve broken four or five without pursuing a notably more risky lifestyle. Their knees might not be shot, mine are! It’s how it is.</p>
      <p>Anyway, here is a quick run-down of the problems which are keeping Burton physio Nick Fenton busy in the lead-up to the Salford replay and beyond. It amounts to a full starting 11...</p>
      <p>
        <b>John Brayford</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ideally would not have come off the bench against Mansfield Town in midweek. An ever-willing warhorse, Brayford is always, these days, coaxing his knees through the season. Had Fox not been injured, he and Brayford would most likely be sharing the load at right-back this season.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Jake Buxton</b>
      </p>
      <p>A rib injury sustained in a typically uncompromising 50-50 challenge against Bristol Rovers literally took the wind out of the club captain. You know it’s nothing minor when Buxton stays down. After nine weeks out, he returned in the first game against Salford but had to come off against Mansfield with a back issue.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Reece Hutchinson</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Academy product looked to have got ahead of Colin Daniel as first choice left-back before a hip problem slowed him up. He has been battling it for more than a month now.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Richard Nartey</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Chelsea loanee has looked a class act at centre-half but last season in the Blues’ Under-23s was shortened by injury and he picked up a niggle in pre-season with Burton when it looked likely he would start the season in the team. He has come off early with a tight hamstring in his last two appearances and it is a problem he and the club hope will have resolved itself by the time the current international break is done with.</p>
      <p>
        <b>John-Joe O’Toole</b>
      </p>
      <p>In super form at centre-back, summer signing O’Toole had to come off with a back spasm against Mansfield Town in midweek.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Stephen Quinn</b>
      </p>
      <p>Quinn is happy to be playing after suffering serious knee problems in the last few years of his career before joining Burton as a free agent last season. A knee injury happily not related to his previous problems has kept him out for a month but he looks to be getting back up to speed now.</p>
      <p>
        <b>David Templeton</b>
      </p>
      <p>See above. The Scottish winger’s career has been punctuated by injuries, before coming to Burton and since. He has yet to complete 90 minutes in a game this season and came off with a sore knee against Mansfield in midweek. His value when available is obvious: he has scored in three of his four starts this season.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Ben Fox</b>
      </p>
      <p>March may be when Fox manages to get back from the cruciate ligament injury suffered in pre-season but he is happy to be back training on grass after the various stages of gym-based rehab.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Lloyd Dyer</b>
      </p>
      <p>The veteran winger, who has been playing at left-back from the bench this season, has also been soldiering on with an ankle problem which he fully succumbed to when left out of the squad for the Salford tie last week.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Oliver Sarkic</b>
      </p>
      <p>An apparently minor hamstring issue has ensured the Brewers are being careful with Sarkic, who signed from Leeds United without the benefit of a full pre-season in the summer. He stayed on the bench for the tie with Salford and was reluctantly introduced by Clough for the second half against Mansfield when Buxton had to withdraw.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Callum Hawkins</b>
      </p>
      <p>The young goalkeeper caught his studs in the turf in training at the start of the season and ruputured the cruciate ligament in his left knee. He has just put his boots back on for a first run on grass as part of his rehab.</p>
