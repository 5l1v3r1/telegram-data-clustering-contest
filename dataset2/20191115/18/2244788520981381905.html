      <h1>JUST IN: NECO dismisses 70 staff for certificate forgery</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T18:56:08+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 18:56</time> by <a rel="author">Nneoma BENSON</a></address>
      <p>
        <b>ON Friday, the management of the National Examinations Council (NECO) announced that it has approved the dismissal of 70 staff for certificate forgery.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a statement signed by the Head, Information and Public Relations Division, Azeez Sani, the dismissal was a sequel to a report submitted by a management committee constituted to verify the certificates of staff.</p>
      <p>“The certificate verification committee carried out its assignment diligently by inviting all staff with questionable credentials to appear before it, during which some staff actually attested that their certificates were fake,” the statement read.</p>
      <p>Subsequently, the committee contacted the schools and institutions the affected staff claimed to have attended, but the institutions denied having certificated them.</p>
      <p>On the completion of their assignment, the committee submitted its findings to NECO management which later submitted to the governing board of the council.</p>
      <p>“At its 17th extraordinary meeting, the governing board vetted the report and approved the dismissal of the affected staff.</p>
      <p>“The council under the able leadership of the Acting Registrar/Chief Executive, Abubakar Gana has zero-tolerance for corruption and is poised to sanitise the system as espoused by President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration.</p>
      <p>“The dismissal of the 70 staff is the first phase in the series of the on-going staff certificate verification exercise in the Council,” the statement read.</p>
