      <h1>Jhené Aiko &amp; Big Sean Seem To Reflect On Their Former Relationship With “None Of Your Concern”</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T18:52:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 18:52</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Mench</a></address>
      <p>Although they reportedly split earlier this year, <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Jhene-aiko">Jhené Aiko</a> and <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Big-sean">Big Sean</a> are on surprisingly good terms. Following Big Sean’s July track, <a href="https://genius.com/Big-sean-single-again-lyrics">“Single Again,”</a> which featured background vocals from Aiko, the Detroit rapper contributes a full verse to the singer’s new single, <a href="https://genius.com/Jhene-aiko-none-of-your-concern-lyrics">“None of Your Concern.”</a> On the track, the two former lovers seem to address the end of their relationship.</p>
      <p>Aiko sings about feeling love slip away:</p>
      <blockquote>I’ve been contemplatin', meditatin'<br/>Should’ve waited, should’ve never dated<br/>You seem irritated, baby, why you never say it?<br/>Isn’t this worth saving?<br/>I can feel you fading, love<br/>We’re not gonna make it, oh</blockquote>
      <p>Later on, she reveals the hurt she’s been through and explains how she finally decided to move on:</p>
      <blockquote>I was traumatized and suicidal, I’m sick and tired, I am not to blame<br/>Once I felt the wave and not today, I’m not afraid, now I can say<br/>Get your bitch ass off of my phone, please leave me alone<br/>I am not your girl anymore, you need to watch your tone<br/>Don’t worry about who it is I’m fuckin' or who I am lovin', just know that it is not you<br/>This isn’t up for discussion, I wish you good luck man</blockquote>
      <p>Some of these lyrics seem to reflect her May 2019 release, <a href="https://genius.com/a/is-jhene-aiko-addressing-her-relationship-with-big-sean-on-triggered-freestyle">“Triggered (Freestyle),”</a> where she sang about feeling disrespected in a relationship and trying to move on without exacting fantasies of revenge. The song was widely believed to be about Big Sean.</p>
      <p>The Detroit rapper comes in at the end of the song to deliver his side of the story, but his most eye-catching lyrics come at the end, when he recalls exactly what made them so good together in the first place:</p>
      <blockquote>But every time I lay down I think about you naked<br/>And if you find my replacement, how could you?<br/>I made you cum nine times in one day<br/>Your two lips should come in a vase, you rode my face<br/>I realize you look as good as you taste, hmm (Yeah)</blockquote>
      <p>Big Sean and Jhené Aiko have a long history of collaboration, going back to songs like 2012’s <a href="https://genius.com/Big-sean-im-gonna-be-lyrics">“I’m Gonna Be”</a> and <a href="https://genius.com/Big-sean-beware-lyrics">2013’s “Beware.”</a> They linked up for the collaborative EP <a href="https://genius.com/albums/Twenty88/Twenty88"><i>Twenty88</i></a> in 2016, too.</p>
      <p>Listen to the song above and <a href="https://genius.com/Jhene-aiko-none-of-your-concern-lyrics">read all the lyrics to Jhené Aiko’s “None of Your Concern” featuring Big Sean</a> on Genius now.</p>
