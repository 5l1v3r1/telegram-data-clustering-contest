      <h1>The Young Turks Founder Cenk Uygur to Run for Congress in Rep. Katie Hill's Seat</h1>
      <h2>Uygur has already received an endorsement from Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) and praise from Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T18:40:02+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 18:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thewrap.com/author/j-clara-chan/" target="_blank">J. Clara Chan</a></address>
      <p>Cenk Uygur, the host and creator of the progressive news and opinion program “The Young Turks,” is running for the Congressional seat vacated by former California Rep. Katie Hill.</p>
      <p>“Whether it is reporting on politics on his online media company The Young Turks, co-founding Justice Democrats and electing true progressives to office or founding Wolf PAC, an organization dedicated to getting big money out of politics, Cenk Uygur has been committed to rooting out corruption in Washington, ending the influence of big money on our politicians and fighting for policies that improve the lives of every single American,” Uygur’s <a href="https://www.cenk2020.com/">campaign website</a> reads. “Now he wants to bring that same fight to Congress for the people of California’s 25th district.”</p>
      <p>In a press release sent on Thursday evening, TYT said that Uygur “will no longer have editorial control over TYT, but will continue hosting TYT and other programs.”</p>
      <p>“To streamline the transition, TYT has created an Office of CEO to make strategic decisions for the company that will report to the board, while day-to-day operations have been handed over to Chief Administrative Officer Jack Gerard who has been named the company’s Interim Chief Operating Officer,” the release said.</p>
      <p>Uygur has already received an endorsement from <a href="https://twitter.com/TheYoungTurks/status/1195157951390072833">Rep. Ro Khanna</a> (D-Calif.) and praise <a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewYang/status/1195211992585269249">from Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang</a>. Actor John Cusack also <a href="https://twitter.com/johncusack/status/1195217984010293250">tweeted his support</a> for Uygur on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“The Young Turks” host, also a frequent guest on CNN’s “Cuomo Prime Time,” has surprised viewers in the past when it came to seemingly cut-and-dry partisan issues. In 2018, Uygur said he disagreed with the advertiser boycott against Fox News host Tucker Carlson, stating that his fate should rest with viewers — not corporations.</p>

      <p>He also <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/the-young-turks-cenk-uygur-call-breitbart-news-an-embarrassment/">defended</a> then-Fox News host Megyn Kelly when she sparred with then-GOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>“Trump has upended our politic in such an interesting and crazy way that he know has created strange bedfellows. He’s got me rooting for a Fox News anchor which previously seemed unimaginable,” Uygur said. “Obviously Megyn is right and Trump is wrong.”</p>
      <p>Republican contenders are also eyeing Hill’s recently vacated seat: George Papadopoulos, the former Trump campaign adviser who was convicted of lying to federal authorities, filed to run for the seat in October.</p>
