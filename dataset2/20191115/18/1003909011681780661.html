      <h1>Calgary-produced We Will Rock You gets New York moving</h1>

      <p>Calgary is rocking the Big Apple.</p>
      <p>Local producer Jeff Parry’s Annerin production of the Queen and Ben Elton musical We Will Rock You has been on a whistlestop tour of North America since Sept. 3 when it previewed in Winnipeg.</p>
      <p>It has been zigzagging across the U.S. with stops in such cities as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Denver, Kansas City and Tulsa and has settled into the Hulu Theatre in New York’s Madison Square Gardens for five performances over four days until Nov. 17.</p>
      <p>Parry says this New York engagement is the litmus test for the kind of Calgary-grown touring musicals he hopes to continue building.</p>
      <p>“Though We Will Rock You opened in London in 2002 and ran for 12 years, it has never had a production in Manhattan. More than 18,000 people will see it at Madison Square Gardens, but even more important, there are 500 industry people scheduled to catch it during its run.</p>

      <p>“If the major players in the entertainment industry like what they see, there is the potential for a very long tour and possibly a Broadway run,” says Parry, who compares his little show playing against giant Broadway musicals as Moulin Rouge, Hadestown, Beetlejuice and Tootsie to “the Hitmen booked to play against the Flames.</p>
      <p>“Most of the current musicals on Broadway cost between $15 million and $30 million to produce and we’re here at a minuscule fraction of that. They want to see if our model is able to stay in the game, which means bringing in the audiences, and I know it can.”</p>
      <p>Parry is proud his We Will Rock You features a full Canadian cast of 16 performers with 10 from Alberta and a creative team entirely made up of Calgarians, including director JP Thibodeau, choreographer Angela Benson, musical director Russell Brown, designers Terry Gunvordahl, Angela Dale, Cat Bentley and Robert Sondergaard.</p>

      <p>“We rehearsed the show in Calgary and Medicine Hat, proving there is the talent and resources in Alberta to mount a show that can hold its head high.”</p>
      <p>Parry admits that in the beginning, the U.S. leg of the tour had a few setbacks but is on track now for recouping its investment and that the major part of the Canadian leg of the tour, which begins in Calgary and Edmonton in late December, “is selling four times as well with Calgary’s run having sold more than 5,000 tickets a month before we open.”</p>
      <p>When it leaves New York on Nov. 17, We Will Rock You will hit Ohio, Indianapolis, Kentucky and Cincinnati, returning to Canada for three performances in Windsor, Ont., before taking a hiatus Dec. 1 to 26. The tour comes to Calgary Dec. 27 to 29 at the Southern Alberta Jubilee and Dec. 30 and 31 at the Jubilee in Edmonton.</p>
      <p>The second leg of the tour already has bookings across Canada until Feb. 19 when it visits the Scotiabank Centre in Halifax, but Parry is confident the tour will be extended, returning to the U.S. and back across Canada.</p>

      <p>Calgarian Hannah Smart, who is part of the show’s ensemble, admits life on the road can be gruelling.</p>
      <p>“We had one stretch where we did seven shows in seven different cities in seven days. It’s exhausting but the moment we hit the stage it’s magic all over again. In every city we’ve played, at the end of the show when we sing We Will Rock You and Bohemian Rhapsody, the audience is on their feet singing along with us. There is no way to adequately describe that kind of  energy and feedback,” says Smart, a former Young Canadian.</p>
      <p>“We played the Microsoft Theatre in Los Angeles where they hold the Emmys and at the Orleans Casino Hotel in Vegas and now we’re at Madison Square Gardens in New York. As a young girl, I had big dreams but what this show has allowed me to do is bigger than anything I dreamed.”</p>
