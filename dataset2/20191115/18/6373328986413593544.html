      <h1>Eminem’s Full Rap Verse Siding With Chris Brown Over Rihanna Assault Leaked Online</h1>

        <b>Eminem’s representatives have released a statement after the full verse in which the rapper appeared to side with Chris Brown over his assault of Rihanna was leaked online. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The unreleased version of Eminem’s 2011 track <i>Things Get Worse </i>began making headlines earlier this month, when <a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/music/eminem-sides-with-chris-brown-while-rapping-about-rihanna-assault-in-leaked-verse-snippet/">a seven-second snippet of the song started doing the rounds</a> on social media.</p>
      <p>Brown pleaded guilty to assaulting Rihanna in 2009 but Eminem still appeared to show support for him in the leaked snippet, in which Em could be heard rapping ‘of course I side with Chris Brown, I’d beat a b*tch down too’.</p>

      <p>The version of the song that was released didn’t mention Chris Brown or Rihanna, but the full, previously unreleased verse has now been leaked, revealing a solid reference to the female singer.</p>
      <p>The extended version of the single was apparently recorded during production for Eminem’s album <i>Relapse, </i>released the same year the assault took place and just months after Brown was charged with felony assault. The singer accepted a plea deal, which included five years probation and domestic violence counselling.</p>

        <b>Eminem’s song included the lyrics:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>I’m not playing, Rihanna, where’d you get the V.D. at?<br/><br/>Let me add my two cents<br/><br/>Of course I side with Chris Brown I’d beat a b*tch down too<br/><br/>If she gave my d*ck an itch now.</blockquote>
      <p>Other controversial lyrics on the track speak about beating a sex worker ‘mercilessly’ and leaving her ‘for dead’, while another lyric mentioned murdering actor Dakota Fanning, who was 16 years old at the time the song was recorded.</p>

      <p>Eminem’s publicist, Dennis Dennehy, made a statement to <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/11/eminem-rihanna-chris-brown-assault-lyrics-song-leaks/"><i>XXL</i></a> in response to the leaked lyric, in which he appeared to gloss over the fact the rapper had sided with Brown.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Dennehy said:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>This is a leak of something that’s over 10 years old. After Eminem recorded it, he scrapped it, and rewrote it. Obviously he and Rihanna have a great relationship.</blockquote>

      <p>Though the lyric was certainly a controversial one, Eminem and Rihanna do appear to get on – at least professionally – as they have collaborated on numerous occasions, including on their hit singles <i>Love the Way You Lie</i> and <i>The Monster. </i></p>
      <p>Rihanna has not commented on the content of the lyrics at this time.</p>
