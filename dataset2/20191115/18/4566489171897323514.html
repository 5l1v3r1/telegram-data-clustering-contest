      <h1>UN renews C.Africa peacekeeping mission</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T18:40:11+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 18:40</time> by <a rel="author">AFP</a></address>
      <p>The United Nations Security Council extended the UN's peacekeeping mission in the violence-plagued Central African Republic for another year on Friday.</p>
      <p>The decision comes two months after four UN personnel died when a Russian-made helicopter crashed during an operation against the 3R militia, one of several armed groups in the country.</p>
      <p>The mission -- known by the acronym MINUSCA -- authorizes the presence of 11,650 troops and 2,080 police in CAR in order to protect civilians and foster stability.</p>
      <p>It is also authorized to help facilitate presidential, legislative and local elections scheduled for 2020 and 2021.</p>
      <p>The Security Council unanimously renewed its mandate until November 2020.</p>
      <p>It is the first renewal since 14 militias signed up to an eighth attempted peace agreement with the Central African government early this year. Militias have breached the accord repeatedly.</p>
      <p>One of the world's poorest and most unstable nations, CAR has suffered several violent crises since 2003 when former president Francois Bozize seized power in a coup.</p>
      <p>The country spiraled into bloodshed after Bozize was overthrown in 2013.</p>
      <p>Fighting has since forced nearly a quarter of the country's 4.5 million people to flee their homes, and rival militia groups control most of the country.</p>
