      <h1>Huawei’s Mate X is now on sale in China for $2,400</h1>
      <h2>But we don’t know when it might launch elsewhere</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T18:55:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 18:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters" target="_blank">Jay Peters</a></address>
      <p>Huawei’s folding Mate X, which was originally supposed to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18239374/huawei-mate-x-foldable-phone-samsung-galaxy-fold-design-mwc-2019">launch in June</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/6/14/18678795/huawei-foldable-phone-mate-x-launch-date-delayed-september">then September</a>, then on an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/15/20806736/huawei-mate-x-release-date-delay-again">unspecific date in November</a>, then <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/23/20928258/huawei-mate-x-release-date-price-china">on November 15th</a> in China, is now, in fact, officially on sale. The Mate X is the second major foldable to hit the market following the (also delayed) Samsung Galaxy Fold.</p>
      <p>The Mate X stands out from other foldables because its folding screen is on the <i>outside</i> of the phone, unlike the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/30/20938653/samsung-galaxy-fold-review-updated-android-price-specs-features-hinge">Galaxy Fold’s</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20963294/motorola-razr-new-foldable-smartphone-android-hands-on-flip-phone-photos-video">Motorola Razr’s</a> internally folding screens. That means that when the Mate X is folded, it has a 6.6-inch screen on the front and a 6.38-inch screen on the back — and when it’s unfolded, its screen is eight inches diagonally. The phone is also equipped with 5G, Huawei’s Kirin 980 processor, and a dual-cell 4,500mAh battery.</p>
      <aside>All that tech comes at a steep price</aside>
      <p>All that tech comes at a very steep price — it costs 16,999 yuan, which shakes out to a little more than $2,400 dollars. And right now, you can only buy it from Vmall, Huawei’s online store in China.</p>
      <p>It’s unclear if or when the device might come to other countries, but in October, Huawei told <i>The Verge</i> that “a global launch plan is under review.” And Huawei remains under heavy scrutiny by the US government, so Huawei may never sell the phone stateside.</p>
