      <p>Portugal forward Cristiano Ronaldo grew into a world-class player during his time at Manchester United, but he did not get on with all his teammates, and it has now been claimed that one of them even reduced him to tears on one occasion.</p>

      <p>In a recent interview, ex-United striker Louis Saha discussed the relationship former Netherlands international Ruud van Nistelrooy had with Ronaldo, with it being reported that the pair did not always see eye to eye.</p>
      <p>The Frenchman revealed that one of their spats actually led to the Portuguese breaking down in tears as it took place around the same time his father passed away in 2005.</p>

      <p>"Ruud had that kind of ego: he wanted all the passes," Saha told <i>FourFourTwo.</i></p>
      <p>"And sometimes, for the development of Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney, it was difficult for the manager to deal with.</p>
      <p>"Did Ruud make Ronaldo cry? Yeah, there were stories because I think they ended up in an argument at the moment when Cristiano's father had passed away, so it wasn't the right moment.</p>
      <p>"Things like that happen when two players have lots of spirit, but I'm sure Ruud regrets some of his words.</p>
      <p>"Cristiano was just an animal. I don't know if you can say that he was a human! You could see, from when he was 18 or 19, that this guy was not normal.</p>
      <p>"These players who have all the ability recognise that it's also about working harder than anyone â€“ not just talent.</p>
      <p>"The top seeds in tennis don't hit the ball better or have better technique; no, they work harder than anyone, and Cristiano did that."</p>
      <p>Many believe Van Nistelrooy was sold by United in 2006 in order to clear space for the likes of Wayne Rooney, Ronaldo and Saha to shine as it appeared the Dutchman had lost his importance in the team.</p>
