      <h1>Hulu Live TV jumps to $55/month making it more expensive than YouTube TV</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T18:09:09+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 18:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/nexusben1/" target="_blank">Ben Schoon</a></address>
      <p>Hulu has been a big player in the live TV streaming market for a while but this week subscribers are getting bad news. Hulu Live TV is <a href="https://www.hulu.com/press/hulu-update/update-on-hulu-live-tv/">getting</a> a big price jump up to $55 a month.</p>
      <p>Starting December 18th, the Hulu + Live TV bundle will jump from its current $45/month price to $55/month for all users. Even if you’re subscribed right now, you won’t be grandfathered into the older price point.</p>
      <p>Hulu’s Live TV option managed to take the number one spot in the category over the popular Sling TV just a few months ago as <a href="https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/hulu-price-increase-live-tv-55-per-month-1203406289/"><i>Variety</i></a> points out.</p>
      <p>This new higher price point also makes Hulu’s option more expensive than Google’s YouTube TV option. That service offers a handful of advantages including unlimited DVR space for a slightly more affordable $50 per month. Of course, Hulu + Live TV does offer something extra for that price since you’re also getting access to standard Hulu too.</p>
      <blockquote>Today, we’re letting customers know that the monthly base price of Hulu + Live TV will increase to $54.99, beginning December 18.  The new price better reflects the substantial value of Hulu + Live TV and allows us to continue offering all of the popular live news, sports and entertainment programming included in the plan.<br/>Price changes are never easy to stomach, and we know that many people don’t watch live television year-round, so we’ve made it easy for Hulu subscribers to switch back and forth between our plans to best suit their needs. If you love college football, choose Hulu + Live TV during the season, then switch to one of Hulu’s less expensive on-demand plans when it’s over. If you enjoy most of your TV on demand but really want to watch live election news, just switch to Hulu + Live TV for a few months.</blockquote>
