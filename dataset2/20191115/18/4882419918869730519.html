      <p>Real Madrid forward Gareth Bale is set for more criticism after his latest comments.</p>
      <p>Oft accused of preferring to play for his country than his club and prioritising Wales’s games, he has confirmed that effectively in comments ahead of his team’s game against Azerbaijan.</p>
      <p>"With Wales, I'm speaking my own language and feeling more comfortable," said Bale.</p>
      <p>"I definitely have a bit more excitement playing for Wales.</p>
      <p>"I've been with most of the players, especially the older ones, since we were in the Under-17s. It's like playing with your mates down the park on a Sunday.</p>
      <p>"But it still doesn't change what I give on the pitch. I always give 100 percent wherever I am, and that's what I always strive to do."</p>
