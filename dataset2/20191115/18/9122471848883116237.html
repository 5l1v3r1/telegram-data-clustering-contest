      <h1>Oklahoma at Baylor: Game Time, Spread, Channel, Announcers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T18:36:11+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 18:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>In a possible Big 12 Championship Game preview, the Oklahoma Sooners take on the undefeated Baylor Bears at McLane Stadium.</p>
      <p>Oklahoma recovered from their stunning loss at Kansas State last month with a win over Iowa State last week. They’re still <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/the-college-football-playoff-rankings-after-week-11-have-been-released">well outside of a College Football Playoff berth</a> at this point, coming in at No. 10 this week. The Sooners will need to win out and claim the Big 12 title to have a chance. That may not be too tough given how excellent quarterback Jalen Hurts has been all year.</p>
      <p>But the Baylor Bears have proven resilient, even if they don’t have the most high-octane offense in the Big 12. The Bears are 9-0, though five of those games have been decided by one score or less. If Baylor can beat Oklahoma and Texas in back-to-back weeks, it will be hard for the selection committee to ignore Baylor’s College Football Playoff resume – especially if they go 13-0 with a Big 12 title. The Bears are currently ranked No. 13, despite their undefeated record.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, Oklahoma’s overwhelming offense has led to sports bettors giving the Sooners top odds. They head to Waco as double-digit favorites over the Bears.</p>

      <p>Here are the details for the game:</p>
      <p><b>Game Time:</b> 7:30 PM ET</p>
      <p><b>Channel:</b> ABC</p>
      <p><b>Spread:</b> <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/game/_/gameId/401112082">Oklahoma -10.5</a></p>
      <p><b>Over/Under:</b> 67.5</p>
      <p><b>Announcers:</b> Chris Fowler, Kirk Herbstreit, Maria Taylor</p>
      <p>The loser of this game is for all intents and purposes out of College Football Playoff contention. No two-loss non-SEC champion has a chance of getting into the tournament. And with Baylor already ranked No. 13, a loss likely means that there isn’t a path to the Bears impressing the committee enough to get into the mix.</p>
      <p>It should be a high-scoring game. We’re all looking forward to it.</p>
