      <h1>Gold totters as trade deal optimism propels stocks to record highs</h1>
      <h2>Wall Street's main indexes hit record highs at the open on upbeat comments related to US-China trade talks and strong earnings</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T18:33:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 18:33</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>Gold prices were on track to break a three-session winning streak on Friday, as stock <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/international-news-markets-1160103.htm">markets </a>hit record highs following comments from US officials that progress was being made on the "phase one" trade agreement with China.</p>
      <p>Spot gold was down 0.2% at $1,467.48 per ounce at 12:54 p.m. EST (1754 GMT). US gold futures were down 0.4% at $1468.20 per ounce.</p>
      <p>"Overall trading gold has been impacted by the trade war and there is tremendous optimism with the final stages of getting stage one deal ratified," said Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at OANDA.</p>
      <p>"This has been the biggest headwind for the global economy and a major de-escalation is derailing the safe-haven demand (for gold)."</p>
      <p>Wall Street's main indexes hit record highs at the open on upbeat comments related to US-China <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/trade-talks">trade talks </a>and strong earnings.</p>
      <p>US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said US-China <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/trade-talks">trade talks </a>were set to continue with a telephone call on Friday as both sides seek to hammer out a phase one trade pact.</p>
      <p>Gold prices retreated from a near one-week peak hit on Thursday, but were still set for a weekly gain of about 0.6%.</p>
      <p>"This week's been a story of gold really trying to claw back some of the losses from the previous week, and it has done that to a degree, we are up from the lows from $1,450 and gold is attempting to get back above the 100-day moving average," said Mitsubishi analyst Jonathan Butler.</p>
      <p>"Next week we've got some interesting data - the manufacturing PMIs and FOMC meeting minutes coming out which will show whether there were any dissenting voices in US</p>
      <p>Federal Reserve arguing for stronger set of rate cuts or whether the consensus was really for keeping the rates on hold." US<br/>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday signalled no further cuts will occur unless there is a "material" change in the economic outlook.</p>
      <p>Gold prices have gained more than 14% so far this year as the trade dispute between the world's biggest economies roiled financial markets, stoking fears of a global economic slowdown and prompting major central banks to reduce interest rates.</p>
      <p>Among other precious metals, silver edged 0.1% lower to $17 per ounce, but was on track for a gain of over 1% for the week.</p>
      <p>Platinum rose 1.3% to $891.34 per ounce and was set to register a rise of about 0.6% this week.</p>
      <p>Palladium was down 1% at $1,720.25 per ounce, on course to fall for the second straight week at about 1.4%.</p>
