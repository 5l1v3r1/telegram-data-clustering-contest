      <p>MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Ousted Bolivian president Evo Morales said in an interview with Reuters on Friday that he was not organizing demonstrations from Mexico, where he has been given asylum.</p>
      <p>Morales resigned under pressure and fled to Mexico earlier this week after protests and violence following an Oct. 20 election that was tarnished by widespread allegations of fraud.</p>
      <p>Supporters of Morales have continued to agitate on his behalf with marches and skirmishes in the streets of the capital La Paz and nearby El Alto.</p>
