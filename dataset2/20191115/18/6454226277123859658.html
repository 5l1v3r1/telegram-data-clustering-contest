      <h1>Just over two-thirds of the latest weekly auction sales were for more than their rating valuations</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T18:26:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 18:26</time> by <a rel="author">Greg Ninness</a></address>
      <p>There was a dip in the number of property auctions monitored by interest.co.nz at the start of November but the number of properties that were sold increased.</p>
      <p>Interest.co.nz monitored 261 residential property auctions throughout the country in the week from 4-10 November, down from 293 the previous week.</p>
      <p>Of those, sales were achieved on 141 properties, up from 130 the previous week, which pushed the sales rate up to 54% from 44%..</p>
      <p>Prices were generally firmer with just over two thirds (68%) selling for more than their rating valuations.</p>
      <p>There continued to be very little variation between the results in Auckland and the rest of the country.</p>
      <p>In Auckland the sales rate was 55% and prices also firmed with 65% selling for more than their rating valuations.</p>
      <p>And there are very few properties having their auctions postponed or being withdrawn from sale, with just one postponement and one withdrawal at the latest auctions monitored.</p>
      <p>Details of the individual properties offered at all of the auctions monitored by interest.co.nz are available on our <a href="https://www.interest.co.nz/property/residential-auction-results"><b>Residential Auction Results page.</b></a></p>
