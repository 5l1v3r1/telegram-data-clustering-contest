      <h1>Penultimate C7 Corvette Being Enshrined At National Corvette Museum</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T18:12:39+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 18:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.motorious.com/" target="_blank">Jeffrey N. Ross</a></address>
      <h4>While the last C7 will be in a private collection, this '19 Corvette Stingray will be on display for all to see.</h4>
      <p>The final C7 Corvette rolled off the assembly line on November 14th at around 3:10 pm CT marking the end of the line for the front-engine Corvette before production begins for the <a href="https://www.motorious.com/articles/features/360879/2020-mid-engine-corvette-c8">all-new, mid-engine C8 'Vette</a>. The final Corvette – a black Z06 – was auctioned off earlier in the year for $2.6 million to a software company CEO, but the second to last Corvette isn't going far. This car will be delivered at and then donated to the <a href="https://www.corvettemuseum.org/?utm_source=motorious.com&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=motorious">National Corvette Museum</a>, which is right across the street from the Corvette's assembly plant in Bowling Green, Kentucky.</p>

      <p>This penultimate C7 was purchased by the NCM's lifetime member and supporter, Ivan Schrodt, who will take delivery of the car on November 20th via Chevy's museum delivery program. Immediately afterward, he will hand the keys over to the museum where this Corvette will be enshrined among all of the other important and significant Corvettes on display. This Corvette will be a permanent fixture at the museum, and it is a fitting send off for the C7 Corvette ahead of the highly anticipated launch of the C8.</p>
      <p>As for the second to last Corvette, it is painted in Arctic White with a Jet Black and Adrenaline Red interior. This car came in the mid-level 2LT trim level with the upgraded Z51 performance suspension, and it was also equipped with Carbon Fiber and Painted Body Color removable roofs, Carbon Flash exterior trim accents, chrome emblems, red calipers, personalized plate package, brake package, performance exhaust and chrome aluminum wheels. All in, this well-equipped Corvette had a sticker price of just over $70,000, making it quite an impressive donation to the museum.</p>
      <p>This donation ceremony will take place at the National Corvette Museum on November 20th starting at 2:00 p.m. CT, and the museum has invited the public to attend.</p>
