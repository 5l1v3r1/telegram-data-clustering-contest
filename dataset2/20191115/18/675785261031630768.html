      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T18:37:22+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 18:37</time> by <a rel="author">Mikey Smith, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mikey-smith/</a></address>
      <p>Boris Johnson's pole dancing pal Jennifer Arcuri was hauled into a meeting with officials today to answer questions over on whether her firm will be handed more government cash.</p>
      <p>The model-turned tech entrepreneur, 34, was spotted walking past the gates of Downing Street yesterday afternoon, wearing a fur-trimmed cloak, sunglasses and sporting a matching designer handbag and shoes.</p>
      <p>She was on her way to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport where officials were to give her a grilling on the £100,000 grant promised to her firm Hacker House.</p>
      <p>A review last month decided the grant had been "appropriate" despite the firm being based in California.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson remains under pressure over claims he had a sexual relationship with Ms Arcuri while he was Mayor of London.</p>
      <p>He has denied improperly arranging favours for his 'tech advisor', but repeatedly dodged questions over whether they had an affair.</p>

      <p>US-born Ms Arcuri has set up a base in a Westminster hotel after jetting in from Los Angeles on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>Asked if she was in London to answer questions about government grants, Ms Arcuri said: "Among other things. I'm not answering any more questions."</p>
      <p>She refused to answer any further questions until after the broadcast of an ITV documentary on the scandal this weekend.</p>

      <p>The documentary, entitled 'Exposure: When Boris met Jennifer’, is set to be broadcast on Sunday at 11pm on ITV.</p>
      <p>Ms Arcuri told MailOnline: “The show is called When Jennifer Met Boris. I just need it to come out and the debunk the myths. It collaborates (sic) everything I’ve been saying."</p>
      <p>She reportedly left the government building after about an hour and a half.</p>
      <p>Asked by reporters who she thought was going to win the election, she said: “I am.”</p>
      <p>And asked if she would be backing Mr Johnson, she said: “I’m rooting for me.”</p>
