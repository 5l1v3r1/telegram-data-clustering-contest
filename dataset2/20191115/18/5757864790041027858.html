      <p>There are many <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/59748/10-turkey-myths-debunked">misconceptions</a> surrounding your Thanksgiving turkey, but none is more dangerous than the turkey-washing myth. Raw poultry can contain dangerous microbes like <i>Salmonella</i>, and it's not uncommon for home cooks to rinse their meat under cool water in an effort to wash away these pathogens. The intention may be admirable, but this is a worse turkey sin than overcooking your bird or carving it before letting it rest. According to <a href="https://www.aol.com/article/lifestyle/2019/11/13/reason-should-never-rinse-your-thanksgiving-turkey/23276901/">AOL</a>, rinsing a raw turkey with water is more likely to make you and your dinner guests sick than not cleaning it at all.</p>
      <p>When you wash a turkey in the sink, there's no guarantee that all of the nasty stuff on the outside of it is going down the drain. In fact, the only thing rinsing does is <a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/food-safety-tips-healthy-holidays">spread</a> potentially harmful microbes around. In addition to getting bacteria on you hands and clothes, rinsing can contaminate countertops, sink handles, and even the surrounding air.</p>
      <p>There are three <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/564515/prevent-food-poisoning-tips">main ways</a> to lower your chances of contracting <i>Salmonella</i> when dealing with raw turkey: Thaw your bird in the fridge, minimize contact with it before it goes into the oven, and give it plenty of time to cook once it's in there. For the second part, that means setting aside time to pat your turkey dry, remove the excess fat and skin, and season it without handling anything else. To reduce the risk of <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/5-tips-make-sure-thanksgiving-turkey-safe-from-salmonella/">cross-contamination</a>, wash your hands frequently and wash the plates, knives, and other tools that touched the turkey before using them again. You should also cook your stuffing outside the turkey rather than shoving it inside the cavity and creating a <i>Salmonella</i> bomb.</p>
      <p>Once the safety aspect is taken care of, you can focus on making your turkey taste as delicious as possible. Here are some <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/88712/12-turkey-cooking-tips-real-chefs">tips</a> from professional chefs on making your starring dish shine this Thanksgiving.</p>
