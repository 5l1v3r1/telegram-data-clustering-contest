      <h1>Myles Garrett Responds To Indefinite NFL Suspension</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T18:54:42+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 18:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>Anyone who saw Browns DE Myles Garrett swing a helmet at Steelers QB Mason Rudolph yesterday knew a suspension was looming. And that’s exactly what he got.</p>
      <p>The NFL didn’t even need an entire day to figure out what to do after seeing the footage. Earlier today they handed down an indefinite suspension to Garrett.</p>
      <p>Fines were also issued to both teams and lesser suspensions to other players who got involved.</p>
      <p>Now Garrett himself has responded to the suspension.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Garrett apologized to Rudolph, the Browns, and the NFL as a whole. He called what he did “a terrible mistake” and admitted to losing his cool before acting selfishly. Garrett pledged to be accountable and learn from his mistake.</p>
      <blockquote>“Last night, I made a terrible mistake. I lost my cool and what I did was selfish and unacceptable. I know that we are all responsible for our actions and I can only prove my true character through my actions moving forward. I want to apologize to Mason Rudolph, my teammates, our entire organization, our fans and to the NFL. I know I have to be accountable for what happened, learn from my mistake and I fully intend to do so.”</blockquote>

      <p>Garrett has now been ruled out for a bare minimum of the remainder of 2019.</p>
      <p>Whether the NFL will be inclined to listen to his case for reinstatement next year remains to be seen.</p>
      <p>But it’s clear that Garrett is already taking the necessary steps to get that reinstatement.</p>
