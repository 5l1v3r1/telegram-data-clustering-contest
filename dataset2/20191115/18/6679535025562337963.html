      <h1>Udumalpet honour killings documentary nominated for International Emmy</h1>
      <h2>The 25-minute documentary India’s forbidden love: An honour killing on trial, was aired on Al Jazeera’s Witness in 2018.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T18:06:54+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 18:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/S-Poorvaja-925/" target="_blank">S. Poorvaja</a></address>
      <p>In March 2017, Sadhana Subramaniam was going through newspapers looking for a story for her university graduate project when she happened to read about the honour killing of Dalit youth Shankar.</p>
      <p>Shankar and Gowsalya were attacked in broad daylight and he was hacked to death in March 2016 in Udumalpet.</p>
      <p>Ms. Gowsalya subsequently accused her parents of orchestrating the killing since her family, from a dominant caste, could not bear one of their own marrying a dalit.</p>
      <p>Ms. Sadhana’s documentary, <i>India’s forbidden love: An honour killing on trial, </i>follows Ms. Gowsalya as she fights for justice through the courts, testifying against her parents, as well as her brother-in-law Gowtham, who awaits the verdict and is hoping that his parents will be acquitted.</p>
      <p>The 25-minute documentary which was aired on <i>Al Jazeera’s</i> Witness in 2018, is one among four films from across the world nominated for an International Emmy Award in the Documentary category.</p>
      <h3>Larger problem</h3>
      <p>“I knew there was a story here to tell but realised that it was about a larger problem that was deeply entrenched in society,” she says.</p>
      <p>Ms. Sadhana shifted base from the U.K. to Coimbatore and with one camera person, followed the court trials for the next eight months.</p>
      <p>“Gowsalya was very forthcoming but there was some initial resistance from Gowtham’s side. I had to make it clear that I would not misrepresent anything they say. Through the making of the film, I had to ensure that there were strong boundaries drawn. I would not discuss the developments or share information from either side with the other and they respected it as well,” she explains.</p>
      <h3>Follows both sides</h3>
      <p>The film follows both sides of the family through the trial, which culminated in death penalty being awarded to six persons including Ms. Gowsalya’s father for conspiring and killing Shankar.</p>
      <p>While it began as her final year graduate programme project, award winning film maker Orlando von Einsiedel later came on board and her pitch was soon picked up by <i>Al Jazeera</i>.</p>
      <p>From Coimbatore, the film maker divided her time between Coonoor, where Ms. Gowsalya lived, Palani, where Mr. Gowtham and his family stayed, and the Tiruppur court.</p>
      <p>“At the end of 8 months, I had over 150 hours of footage.</p>
      <p>There were additional responsibilities as well since I had to fact check everything that was included in the final cut and work with a legal counsel,” she says, when asked about how the film took shape.</p>
      <h3>Eye-opener</h3>
      <p>“Having grown up shielded from caste and how it affects society, the process of making this observational documentary was an eye-opener for me. We are all responsible for the prevalence of such issues in a direct or indirect way and as a society, we need to have more conversations about this,” she adds.</p>
      <p>An investment banker by profession, Ms. Sadhana changed careers in 2016 and enrolled herself in a masters programme in documentary film making and investigative journalism at University College London.</p>
      <p>While she still occasionally consults as an investment banker, Ms. Sadhana says she’s already begun work on her next project, which is a feature length documentary.</p>
