      <p>Former hostages Terry Waite and John McCarthy have been reunited at an event honouring humanitarian work.</p>
      <p>The British pair were present when Ingrid Betancourt received the St Martin’s Lifetime Achievement Award in London.</p>
      <p>The award commended Ingrid’s humanitarian work after she was released from six-and-a-half years in captivity by the FARC guerrilla army in Colombia.</p>
      <p>Terry and John are rarely seen in public together but are both active members and supporters of the charity Hostage International.</p>
      <p>The last time they were together was in May when John supported Terry as he received the same achievement award.</p>

      <p>Hostage International was co-founded in 2004 by Terry, who saw a gap in provision for families and former hostages.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘I often feel that the difficulties that families face are almost equally as difficult as what the hostage himself or herself faces.</p>

      <p>‘Hostage International gives much needed emotional and practical support to the families affected and returning hostages.’</p>

      <p>In January 1987, Terry travelled to Beirut in Lebanon on behalf of the Archbishop of Canterbury to try to help with the release of Western hostages, including John.</p>
      <p>However, he was kidnapped himself by a cell linked to the militant group Hezbollah.</p>
      <p>Terry was held for 1,763 days, the majority of which he was deprived of contact with the outside world.</p>
      <p>He was released 28 years ago and will mark the anniversary with an event in London’s Trafalgar Square on Monday November 18.</p>
      <p>The bells of St-Martin-in-the-Fields will ring out before Terry shares his story to raise funds for Hostage International.</p>

      <p>Ingrid was captured in 2002 and held in the Colombian jungle, often chained to trees, until she was rescued more than six years later.</p>
      <p>She has praised the work of Hostage International and added: ‘Coming back after captivity is as hard as the captivity.’</p>
