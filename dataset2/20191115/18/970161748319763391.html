      <p>Former <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tv-soaps/casualty/">Casualty</a> star <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/05/01/coronation-street-spoilers-casualty-star-jane-hazlegrove-cast-gemma-winters-mum-9375369/">Jane Hazlegrove joined the cast</a> of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tv-soaps/coronation-street/">Coronation Street</a> as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/gemma-winter/">Gemma Winter</a> (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dolly-rose-campbell/">Dolly Rose Campbell</a>) and Paul Foreman’s (Peter Ash) <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/24/who-plays-gemmas-mum-in-coronation-street-and-who-did-she-play-in-casualty-10453490/">mum earlier this year</a> and she’s been a force to be reckoned with on the Cobbles ever since.</p>
      <p>Playing mum Bernie, Jane was given character who was described as: ‘an old raver who still sees herself as a free spirit. She is not one to be tied down to a man, a job or any responsibilities, especially when it means hard work for her.’</p>
      <p>Her early storylines saw her get accused of shoplifting and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/06/28/coronation-street-spoilers-gemma-winters-mum-steals-her-urine-for-pregnancy-scam-10080769/">steal her daughter’s urine</a> to sell fake, positive pregnancy tests.</p>
      <p>However, things have <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/08/coronation-street-spoilers-historic-sex-abuse-storyline-revealed-paul-foreman-10539614/">taken a dark turn</a> and it has since transpired that Bernie’s ex, Paul and Gemma’s stepdad, Kel (Joe Alessi) <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/03/coronation-streets-spoilers-dark-historical-abuse-storyline-begins-for-paul-10590188/">sexually abused Paul as a child</a>.</p>

      <p>‘For everybody when something like this is revealed it affects every single person,’ she continued. ‘Not just Paul and everything he’s buried, it’s every single person around them. It ripples through the family forever.’</p>
      <p>After watching a clip of Paul telling Bernie that she failed him, a particularly proud Jane was visibly emotional.</p>

      <p>But what was former Casualty actress Jane Hazlegrove in before she became a soap staple and who is her partner in real life?</p>
