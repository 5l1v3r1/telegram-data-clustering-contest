      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/mariah-carey-surprises-kids-millie-bobby-brown-meeting-revealing-stranger-things-obsession-11127446/">Millie Bobby Brown</a> wants to wear more ‘fitted’ clothes and show off her womanly figure.</p>
      <p>The 15-year-old <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/stranger-things/">Stranger Things</a> actress said she’d like to adjust her style to show what it’s like ‘being a woman’ of her age.</p>
      <p>‘I would really enjoy wearing more fitted clothes now,’ she said. ‘I feel like I’m becoming someone and being a woman so I just want to show that.</p>
      <p>The young star – who plays Eleven in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/netflix/">Netflix</a> series – said she’s conscious she’s a role model to a lot of young girls.</p>
      <p>‘I think about the girls who are going to look at the picture – those young girls that are going to look at me and if they think, “Wow that’s what I should dress up as”.</p>
      <p>‘They are my age, so those are the ones I think of.’</p>

      <p>She added to <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/fashion-news/a29637240/millie-bobby-brown-pandora-interview/">Harper’s Bazaar</a>: ‘It’s always difficult to dress for a red carpet event because a lot of people have opinions and unfortunately you say you won’t listen to it, but you actually kind of have to.</p>
      <p>‘For me, I sit there and think, I’m not going to listen to what they have to say, journalists or whoever wants to write badly about my inappropriate outfit.’</p>
      <p>Millie made headlines recently when she <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/mariah-carey-surprises-kids-millie-bobby-brown-meeting-revealing-stranger-things-obsession-11127446/">met Mariah Carey’s twins</a>, Moroccan and Monroe.</p>
      <p>In the cutest picture ever, the Emotions singer’s kids are seen smiling with joy as Millie sweetly hugs them.</p>
      <p>Mariah captioned the photo: ‘Roc and Roe’s best day of their 8 year old lives! Thank you @milliebobbybrown for this moment, we had a blast!’</p>
      <p>Millie’s certainly got some young fans!</p>
