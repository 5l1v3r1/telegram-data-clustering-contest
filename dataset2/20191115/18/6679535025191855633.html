      <h2>M. Anjana takes charge as Alappuzha Collector</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T18:17:20+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 18:17</time> by <a rel="author">Staff Reporter</a></address>
      <p>The district administration will take all possible steps to complete all pending works and materialise the Alappuzha bypass project, District Collector M. Anjana has said.</p>
      <p>Ms. Anjana, who assumed charge as Alappuzha Collector on Friday, said the administration would give priority to waste management.</p>
      <h3>Drinking water</h3>
      <p>On issues related to the Alappuzha drinking water project, the Collector said that she would hold discussions with the authorities concerned in a bid to find a lasting solution to the issue.</p>
      <p>“I have attended a meeting convened earlier this week to discuss the drinking water issue. We will find a lasting solution to the issue,” she said.</p>
      <p>Frequent bursting of pipes supplying drinking water under the Alappuzha drinking water project is causing hardships to residents in Alappuzha municipality and nearby grama panchayats. Recently, thousands of families had been left without water for almost two weeks following a pipe burst at Thakazhy.</p>
      <h3>Special focus</h3>
      <p>Ms. Anjana added that special focus would be given to the health and tourism sector in the district.</p>
