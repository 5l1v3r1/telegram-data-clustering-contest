      <p>Bowing to demands from different quarters, the Southern Railway is likely to introduce a third train service from north Kerala to Bengaluru.</p>
      <p>After a meeting of Railway officials attached to the Palakkad Division held in Kozhikode last week, another round of discussion was held in Chennai. Priority has been accorded for starting a new train service to Bengaluru, said M.K.Raghavan, MP. At present, weekly trains Yesvantpur Express (16528) and Yesvantpur Express (16566) run from Kozhikode to Bengaluru. A proposal to convert the weekly train (16565/16566) into a daily service was under consideration. But, more services were required, especially from north Kerala, to connect to the IT city, said Mr. Raghavan.</p>
      <p>Southern Railway Chief Operations Manager (COM) S. Anantharaman, with whom he had a meeting, also assured the MP that steps would be taken to improve rail connectivity for the passengers of Malabar. The steps include starting of MEMU trains in the Mangaluru-Kozhikode-Shoranur sector.</p>
      <p>The COM said he would also look into the possibility of starting a Mangaluru-Madurai Intercity Express train, besides extending the Goa-Mangaluru Intercity Express to Shoranur.</p>
      <p>Mr. Raghavan said another proposal was regarding increasing the frequency of trains such as Rajadhani Express, Mangalore Kacheguda Express, Kannur-Thiruvananthapuram Jan Shatabdi Express and Howrah-Mangaluru Vivek Express. Proposals such as establishing a pit-lane and upgrading the West Hill Station as second terminal for Kozhikode station and additional coaches for Parasuram Express also came up during the discussion, he said.</p>
