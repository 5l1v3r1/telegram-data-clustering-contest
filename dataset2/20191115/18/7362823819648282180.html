      <p>A customer at a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/fast-food">Popeyes</a> restaurant in Texas was shocked when he witnessed a young boy working in the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle">kitchen</a>.</p>
      <p>According to the customer, the boy looked to be about “9 years old” and was seen “handling raw chicken before giving it to a male staff worker who went on to cook it.”</p>

      <p>The source, who requested to stay anonymous, told South West News Service (SWNS) the kitchen was “very short-staffed” and the restaurant had a line out of the door with wait times surging over an hour for the coveted Chicken Sandwich, which had returned the day of the incident.</p>
      <p>“While I was there, there was only one person working the front counter and four employees in the kitchen,” the source said.</p>

      <p>“It was so insane. I was a waiter for a number of years and I've never seen anything like that," he added.</p>
      <p>The customer claims that at one point, another employee placed a bunch of orders in bags on the counter without calling order numbers because she had to run back to the kitchen to help prepare more sandwiches.</p>

      <p>“We took swift action to explore this claim with the franchisee. The restaurant owner has terminated the employee who brought their child, a minor, into the kitchen, and will fully cooperate with any additional investigations in compliance with state and federal laws.</p>
      <p>“The safety of our guests and team is always a priority for us and we take any actions that are outside of our brand and operational standards very seriously,” the statement read.</p>
