      <h1>New Middle-Eastern Hypercar Is A 1,200-HP Monster</h1>
      <h2>Say hello to the dragon-inspired Ajlani Drakuma hypercar.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T18:45:55+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 18:45</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Bigg</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/this-3-million-ev-is-the-fastest-accelerating-car-in-the-world">2,012-horsepower Aspark Owl</a> wasn't the only absurdly powerful hypercar that debuted at the Dubai Auto Show this week. After <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/new-middle-eastern-hypercar-brand-ready-to-unleash-the-dragon">last month's teaser</a>, Middle-Eastern-based company Ajlani Motors has presented its new hypercar called the "Drakuma" with a design inspired by "the soul of the dragon." No, we haven't heard of them either.</p>
      <p>The company was founded by Bashar Ajlani, who told <a href="https://www.topgear.com/car-news/dubai-motor-show/ajlani-drakuma-1200bhp-twin-turbo-hypercar">Top Gear</a> he is inspired by Pagani. "Horacio Pagani is one of my idols, because he does not compromise when it comes to quality," he told Top Gear.</p>

      <p>The car's striking styling is inspired by Lamborghini, with an aggressive front that features 'fangs', large side air intakes, a wide stance, low roof, and doors that open out "like dragon's wings." There are no photos of the interior available, but the Drakuma has room inside for two occupants. Ajlani is investigating options for the chassis, but the body will be built from carbon fiber to keep the car light.</p>
      <p>Powering the Drakuma is a mid-mounted twin-turbo V8 producing 1,200 horsepower, but performance estimates haven't been detailed.</p>

      <p>There is a catch, however. The car on display is simply a design prototype built over five years to showcase the founder's dream of becoming the next Pagani. That means the car is still a work in progress and the company is looking for investors to fund the project. While some Middle Eastern manufacturers like W Motors have delivered on their promise with the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/this-is-the-fenyr-supersport-the-lykan-hypersport-has-a-sibling">Fenyr SuperSport</a> and <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/lykan-hypersport-appears-in-usa-for-the-first-time">Lykan Hypersport</a>, there are many that haven't. Remember the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/will-the-5000-hp-devel-sixteen-ever-enter-production">Devel Sixteen</a> with its wild V16 engine generating 5,000 hp?</p>
      <p>Time will ultimately tell if the Drakuma makes it to production, but Ajlani intends to build 99 examples with lots of scope for customer customization. The next logical step will be to make a working prototype to demonstrate the car's performance.</p>
