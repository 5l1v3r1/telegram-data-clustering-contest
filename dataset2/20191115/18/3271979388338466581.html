      <p><b>Russell Crowe</b>’s weight is destroying his attempts at renewing his love life? That’s the rude rumor from a tabloid. <b>Gossip Cop</b> found it as false as it is cruel.</p>
      <p>According to the <i><b>National Enquirer</b></i>, Crowe is “crushing hard on his glamorous young assistant who has zero interest in the rotund Romeo.” The outlet claims the actor “has been steadily packing on the pounds” as a result of his 2018 divorce from ex-wife Danielle Spencer, noting that he looked “enormous” and “flabby” while playing Fox News founder Roger Ailes in <i>The Loudest Voice</i>. The tabloid’s sources add that Crowe “is lonelier than ever and is aware he needs to slim down to attract the ladies,” but the actor “has no desire to get to the gym.”</p>
      <p>“Russell is totally out of shape right now, and stuck in a real rut,” adds the alleged insider. “He’s desperate to get his love life back on track and knows he has to lose weight — and lots of it.” The questionable tipster continues, “The word is he’s around 70 pounds more than he should be. He eats like a pig, drinks like a fish, and since he can’t be bothered to work out, it’s not like Russell can have anyone else to blame.”</p>
      <p>The tabloid further accuses Crowe of “lusting after” his assistant despite her rejections. “How can Russell think he’s got a chance looking like he does right now?” the source concludes. “He can’t seem to figure out why girls aren’t interested in him. But the answer’s right there in front of him: He needs to shape up and ditch his slobby lifestyle — stat!”</p>
      <p><b>Gossip Cop</b> checked in with one of our sources in Crowe’s camp, who assured us the tabloid’s claims were “grossly false.” Still, the tabloid can’t even get its fictional story straight. First it claims that Crowe is totally aware he has to lose weight to attract women, but it finishes the piece by saying he doesn’t have a clue why he can’t attract women. If the outlet’s “source” can’t figure out what’s going on with that aspect of the story, how can they be trusted to get any of the other details right?</p>
      <p>Furthermore, <a href="https://people.com/movies/russell-crowe-finalizes-divorce-danielle-spencer/">Crowe and his ex-wife officially separated in 2012</a>, despite only finalizing their divorce last year. How is he suddenly downtrodden and “packing the pounds” when the actor’s marriage actually ended seven years ago? The outlet tries to pin his weight gain on his 2018 divorce, but that’s just when it got finalized. The separation took place years ago. However, that’s not the only piece of dishonest “reporting” from the publication.</p>
      <p>When it comes to the actor’s appearance in <i>The Loudest Voice</i>, the magazine leaves out the fact that <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/russell-crowe-fat-suit-acting-roles/">Crowe wore a fat suit for his role</a> after failing to gain enough weight on his own. That being said, Crowe is currently working on <i>The Georgetown Project</i>, in which he plays a washed-up actor haunted by his past addictions. While he hasn’t commented on his appearance, Crowe is known for going through some serious physical transformations for his roles. <b>Gossip Cop</b> wouldn’t be surprised if he gained weight for the role, but even if that’s not the case, the tabloid is still dead wrong about Crowe’s romantic life and self-esteem.</p>
      <p>Crowe’s changing figure has been the target of the tabloids for a while. In 2017, <b>Gossip Cop</b> busted <i>OK!</i>, a sister publication of the <i>Enquirer</i>, for falsely claiming <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/russell-crowe-weight-fat/">Crowe’s friends were worried about his weight</a>. This February, we called out the <i>Globe</i>, another sister publication, for saying <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/russell-crowe-weight-roger-ailes-role/">Crowe’s friends thought he was “eating himself into the grave.”</a> There’s absolutely no excuse for attacking the actor for his physical appearance with schoolyard insults.</p>
