      <p>AUBURN, Ala. (AP) — Samir Doughty scored a career-high 33 points and J’Von McCormick had a school-record 16 assists, leading No. 22 Auburn to a 116-70 rout of Cal State Northridge on Friday night.</p>
      <p>The Tigers (4-0), who eked out a win over South Alabama on Tuesday night, were in control throughout this time. They scored the first 11 points and led 66-38 at halftime.</p>
      <p>It was the most points Auburn had scored since getting 119 against Winthrop on Nov. 24, 2017.</p>
      <p>Doughty made his first five 3-pointers and scored 22 by halftime against the Matadors (0-4).</p>
      <p>The senior guard finished 10-of-15 shooting and made 6 of 8 3s. He also had eight rebounds. Doughty’s previous career best was 23 points against Duquesne when he was a freshman at VCU.</p>
      <p>Terrell Gomez led Cal State Northridge with 23 points and made five 3-pointers. He was coming off a career-best 33-point game against Pepperdine.</p>
      <p>Advertising</p>
      <p>McCormick had assists on five of Auburn’s first nine baskets and kept setting up scores from there, while committing only one turnover. Freshman Isaac Okoro, who hit the game-winner with 2.9 seconds left against South Alabama, scored 17.</p>
      <p>Danjel Purifoy had 16 points and Austin Wiley added 10 points and nine rebounds.</p>
      <p>Brendan Harrick scored 17 and also made five 3s for CSUN. Elijah Harkless scored 11 points and Jared Pearre had 10.</p>
      <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
      <p>CSUN: Fell to 0-6 against Southeastern Conference opponents. Were outrebounded 52-33.</p>
      <p>Auburn: Has won 16 of its last 17 games dating back to last season’s Final Four run. Started 4-0 for the second straight season, something that hadn’t happened in 20 years. Hit 17 of 35 3-pointers.</p>
      <p>GOTTFRIED’S RETURN</p>
      <p>The Matadors’ coach, Mark Gottfried, is familiar with the Tigers. He led rival Alabama’s program for 11 seasons, a tenure that ended with the 2008-09 season.</p>
      <p>TECHNICALLY SPEAKING</p>
      <p>CSUN’s Harkless and Auburn coach Bruce Pearl both drew technical fouls. Harkless was whistled for flopping late in the first half and Pearl drew the whistle early in the second half.</p>
