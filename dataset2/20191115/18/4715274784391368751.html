      <p>As an ICT solution-based distribution and marketing company, Versatech has carried global brands for the tech market in the Philippines. It has a network of 2,000 resellers in the market. <b>“Partnership is the key”</b> “Versatech is proud to partner with Bose Professional,” declared Stephen Yu, executive vice president of Versatech. “This partnership fits in line with our overarching direction to complete our company’s premier audio video distribution portfolio.” “I’ve been asked many many times why did we consider Versatech as the partner for Bose,” said Liebenberg. “And the word partner is really the key to the whole equation. It’s not about distribution, it’s not about putting products on the market place, it’s really about how we can work together in the market place and add value to customers, to business partners to anybody in the value chain.” </p>
