      <h1>Santa Clarita shooting: Gracie Anne Muehlberger identified as a victim</h1>

      <p>One of the two teen students slain in the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/14/police-responding-to-report-of-school-shooting-in-california/">Southern California school shooting</a> has been identified.</p>
      <p>The victim was identified as Gracie Anne Muehlberger who had just turned 15-years-old on Oct. 10, the Los Angeles County Coroner confirmed to The Post Friday.</p>
      <p>Muehlberger, along with a 14-year-old boy, was gunned down by <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/14/santa-clarita-high-school-shooter-identified-as-nathaniel-berhow/">alleged shooter Nathaniel Berhow</a> Thursday morning at Santa Clarita’s Saugus High School.</p>
      <p>Police previously said that the female victim was 16-years-old. The coroner is still working to confirm the identity of the 14-year-old.</p>
      <p>Surveillance footage captured the suspect, who also attended the school, walk onto the campus’ quad, pull a .45-caliber semiautomatic pistol from his backpack and shoot five fellow students before turning the gun on himself.</p>
      <p>The shooter survived a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head and remained in critical condition Friday.</p>
