      <p>Drilling for oil in the Great Australian Bight continues to divide South Australians. Here are nine burning questions about the proposal. Tackle them in this QUICK SURVEY.</p>
      <p>The offshore drilling regulator, NOPSEMA, sent Norwegian oil giant Equinor back to the drawing board for the fourth time this week, ordering them to <a href="https://www.perthnow.com.au/ae540fef22c15734139db9f970935f40">resubmit their environmental plan</a>.</p>
      <p>Equinor has 21 days to provide NOPSEMA with its updated plan, or it can request an extension.</p>
      <p>The regulatorâ€™s latest request for further information from Equinor is significant in that another global petroleum giant, BP, <a href="https://www.perthnow.com.au/403881c745e84fc46f478026c2002398">pulled out of exploration in The Bight</a> when it was sent back to the drawing board for a third time.</p>
      <p>Environmentalists have argued drilling in The Bight poses risks to the habitat and any spill would be catastrophic.</p>
      <p>The oil and gas lobby say it can be done safely and the economic spin-offs will be significant for the state and nationally.</p>
