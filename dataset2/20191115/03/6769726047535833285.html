      <h1>The power brow beauty trend</h1>

      <p>EYEBROWS are the most talked about feature in the beauty world right now.</p>
      <p>Women (and some men) around the world are grooming, shaping and bolding their arches in the hope of looking like Hollywood A-listers Cara Delevingne and Lily Colins.</p>
      <p>According to West Perth brow specialist Martina Ivey, the ‘power brow’ trend – sporting large dark eyebrows – is still very much in vogue.</p>
      <p>“When I think ‘power brow’ I still associate it with flow and softness: even unruly wild brows can be tweaked to seamless perfection,” she said.</p>
      <p>“That barely-touched-but-symmetrical ‘I woke up like this’ look is our favourite.”</p>
      <p>Ivey believes eyebrows are a person’s most prominent facial feature and getting them just right can do wonders for their appearance.</p>
      <p>“Nothing makes you feel better than perfectly preened eyebrows,” she said.</p>
      <p>“They help you look more youthful, refine your look, define your eyes, balance your face with symmetry and add length and definition to your face.”</p>

      <p>As much as great brows can make a look – and give you confidence – wrongly-shaped brows can ruin your appearance.</p>
      <p>“I always think of brows as scaffolding for the face,” Ivey said.</p>
      <p>“The wrong brow shape can age someone immensely, look too harsh, and create heaviness to the face.</p>
      <p>“A properly trained brow artist can look at your brows and envision your perfect brow from day dot.”</p>
      <p>Treatments such as brow lamination (a brow lift) and henna are trending, according to Ivey.</p>
      <p>“People want modelesque fluffed up brows 24-7 and now they are able to achieve it through brow lamination,” she said.</p>
      <p>“Essentially a lash lift for your brow hairs, it lasts about six weeks and holds hair in place creating newfound volume.”</p>
      <p>Ivey said that correctly filled-in brows in all the right places, without saturation, was the ideal look.</p>
      <p>She includes a makeup lesson for first-time clients at her studio, with pencils, powders and tinted and clear gels.</p>
      <p>“Semi-permanent makeup options (including feathering, ombre or combination brows) are very popular and when done correctly save people a lot of time in the morning,” Ivey said.</p>
      <p>“We always try to grow out the natural brow first, but for many – who have experienced over-plucking, hormonal changes and have naturally sparse brows – we will tattoo (feathering).</p>
      <p>“Brow cosmetic tattooing has come such a long way and continues to evolve and when in the right hands can look absolutely stunning, soft and feminine.”</p>
