      <h3>Ethereum Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>This week, we mostly saw <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/14/ethereum-eth-could-break-higher-after-long-consolidation/">range moves in Ethereum</a> above the $180 and $182 supports against the US Dollar. Recently, ETH made an attempt to climb above the $188 and $190 resistance levels, but it failed.</p>
      <p>A high was formed near $190 and the price started a fresh decline. It broke the $186 support level to move lower towards the range support area. Moreover, there was a break below the $185 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average.</p>
      <p>It opened the doors for more losses and the price is now trading near the $182 support area. The range support near the $180 and $182 levels holds a lot of importance. If Ethereum fails to stay above the $180 support area, there are chances of a sharp breakdown.</p>
      <p>The next key supports are near the $175 and $172 levels. On the upside, an initial resistance is near the $184 level. Besides, the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $190 high to $182 low is also near $184.</p>
      <p>More importantly, there is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $185 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Above the trend line, the price could correct higher towards the $186 resistance.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $190 high to $182 low is near the $186 level to act as a resistance. Therefore, a close above the $186 level and the 100 hourly SMA is needed to avoid a bearish break below the $180 support area.</p>

      <p>Looking at the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSD/">chart</a>, Ethereum price is clearly trading near the last line of defense at $182 and $180. If the bulls fail to defend the $180 support, the price is likely to accelerate lower by 5%-10%. On the upside, there are many resistances such as $186, $188 and $190.</p>
