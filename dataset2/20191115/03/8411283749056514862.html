      <h1>Tong Hsing sees CIS packaging as major growth driver for 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T03:38:25+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 03:38</time> by <a rel="author">Julian Ho, Taipei; Willis Ke, DIGITIMES</a></address>
      <p>Tong Hsing Electronic Industries, which supplies ceramic substrates and backend services for CMOS image sensors and other niche ICs, expects its 2020 revenues to hit a new high on robust expansion in CIS packaging business, according to company president Heinz Ru.</p>
      <p>Tong Hsing reportedly will land substantial CIS packaging orders from its major client OmniVision, which has reportedly won orders for 48 million-pixel CIS devices from Huawei and other Chinese handset vendors. The company declined to comment on matters concerning specific clients or orders.</p>
      <p>But Ru said that strong growth momentum has emerged for Tong Hsing's CIS packaging business since the start of the fourth quarter, and the momentum will turn even stronger in 2020 boosting its revenues to a new record.</p>
      <p>Ru continued that his company has also started stable shipments of optical transceiver modules and handheld ultrasonic sensing heads since September 2019, with the shipments expected to pick up gradually in 2020.</p>
      <p>The firm's shipments of ceramic substrates will see a slight sequential decline in the fourth quarter of 2019 and those of mixed IC modules will stay flat or rise slightly in the quarter, but they are all expected to ramp up gradually in 2020, according to Ru.</p>
      <p>The firm's capex for 2019 reaches NT$1.42 billion (US$46.51 million), and its 2020 capex is expected to return to a high of NT$1.5 billion. Its new plant in Taoyuan, northern Taiwan will kick off construction in early 2020 for volume production of high-end healthcare chip solutions and CIS modules in 2021.</p>
