      <h1>LA Galaxy boss confirms Zlatan Ibrahimovic desire for final club before retirement</h1>
      <h2>Ibrahimovic has been linked with Man Utd and Liverpool after leaving MLS - but Guillermo Barros Schelotto says he is bound for Italy</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T03:07:52+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 03:07</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Zlatan Ibrahimovic wants to play for one last club before retiring - and LA Galaxy boss Guillermo Barros Schelotto says his final move will be to Italy.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/zlatan-ibrahimovic">Ibrahimovic</a> this week confirmed he was leaving LA Galaxy, and has been linked with former clubs Manchester United and AC Milan as the January transfer window lurches ever closer.</p>
      <p>With the 38-year-old set to be available on a free transfer, there has also been speculation of a move to Premier League leaders Liverpool - <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/zlatan-ibrahimovic-liverpool-jurgen-klopp-20882573">although Reds boss Jurgen Klopp quashed such talk</a> .</p>
      <p>And Schelotto has revealed that Ibrahimovic "deserves and wants to finish his career in Italy", with the Swedish striker having previously played for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> and Inter Milan as well as AC Milan.</p>
      <p>The LA Galaxy chief tipped Napoli as a possible destination, with Ibrahimovic having played under the Serie A club's boss Carlo Ancelotti at Paris Saint-Germain.</p>

      <p>“I don’t know what Ibra will do now,” Schelotto told Radio Kiss Kiss.</p>
      <p>“Hes a wonderful player, but I don’t know what his next step will be, maybe he’ll end his career at Napoli or even Milan.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know where, but he deserves and wants to finish his career in Italy.”</p>
      <p>Of the link to Napoli and Ancelotti, Schelotto said:“They know each other well, Zlatan clearly has the characteristics that Naples need."</p>

      <p>Ibrahimovic this week announced his expected departure from LA Galaxy with a cheeky dig at fans of the MLS franchise, telling them to "go back to watch baseball".</p>
      <p>In his parting shot to fans on Twitter, Ibrahimovic said in his typical humble style: “I came, I saw, I conquered. Thank you <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/losangelesgalaxy">LA Galaxy</a> for making me feel alive again.</p>
      <p>"To the Galaxy fans – you wanted Zlatan, I gave you Zlatan. You are welcome. The story continues … now go back to watch baseball.”</p>
      <p>Ibrahimovic scored 52 goals in 56 games in his two seasons at LA Galaxy.</p>
      <p>But despite Ibrahimovic's impressive goals tally in the States, when asked about the striker Liverpool boss <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jurgen-klopp">Klopp</a> made it clear that there is one reason why he won't be signing him.</p>
      <p>“If he had not played for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> before, then we might have considered him," Klopp <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/if-he-hadnt-played-for-man-utd-maybe-klopp-laughs-off/1ufsp6sdwz6fl11sxdgymmi1k0">told Sportbladet</a> . "But I'm not even sure he wanted to play here. We're a pretty intense team…"</p>
