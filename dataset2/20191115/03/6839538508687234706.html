      <p>Is this South Australia’s most talented dog?</p>
      <p>Chocolate labrador Dexter is a natural in the water. The six-year-old has been waterskiing on the River Murray at Morgan with his human family for four years.</p>
      <p>Owner Kimberley Dunn says Dexter loves waterskiing so much he barks if he doesn’t get to have a turn first.</p>
      <p>“He’s a bit of a show-off,” she said. “He loves it when the boat turns around.”</p>

      <p>Ms Dunn, of Parafield Gardens, says her family usually take the boat out over Christmas and the canine has been swimming since he was a puppy.</p>
      <p>Her sister and brother-in-law once took Dexter along on a biscuit (inflatable tube) and the boisterous boy hasn’t looked back since.</p>
      <p>“My dad specially made (Dexter) a board... I said ‘he’s not going to want it by the time you finish’,” she said.</p>
      <p>“But he loves it. He goes on shorter trips now that he’s older, but if he’s tired, he’ll hop off.”</p>

      <p>The family filmed the labrador during river outings and made a video compilation last year.</p>
      <p>Dexter gets a boost in a deepwater start and wears a lifejacket. He has since been given more waterski boards.</p>
      <p>Ms Dunn said locals recognised Dexter when they were out on the river and children got excited seeing him on the board.</p>
      <p>“I see people look twice when Dexter is out in the water … when we’re going past the shacks, people cheer,” she said.</p>
