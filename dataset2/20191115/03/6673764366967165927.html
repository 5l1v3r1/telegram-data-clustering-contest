      <p><b>TAKAMATSU, KAGAWA PREF. – </b>A company executive was arrested Thursday in Shikoku for allegedly incinerating and disposing of his 70-year-old father’s body, with authorities suspecting foul play in the man’s death, police have said.</p>
      <p>Takashi Hayashida, 29, is suspected of unlawfully disposing of the body of his father, Akira, at his home in Takamatsu, Kagawa Prefecture, between Oct. 30 and Wednesday. Hayashida is said to have admitted to the charge.</p>
      <p>The police confirmed they are also investigating the possibility of murder, noting that Hayashida mentioned there having been difficulties with his father in relation to their business.</p>
      <p>According to the police, a woman who lived with Akira saw him leave for work on the morning of Oct. 30. She filed a missing person report on Nov. 1 because he had not returned home.</p>

      <p>Hayashida serves as an executive for a company dealing with dog sales and breeding, and his father was the president, according to a credit research firm.</p>
