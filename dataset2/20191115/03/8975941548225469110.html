      <p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. and China are nearing a trade deal, but President Donald Trump isn’t ready to sign off, White House economic adviser Lawrence Kudlow said Thursday.</p>
      <p>They are getting close to an agreement, Kudlow said in an event held at the Council on Foreign Relations.</p>
      <p>“The mood music is pretty good,” he said, adding that Trump “likes what he sees, he’s not ready to make a commitment, he hasn’t signed off on a commitment for phase one, we have no agreement just yet for phase one.”</p>
      <p>Negotiators for the U.S. and China have been working to come up with a written “phase one” trade deal in which Beijing would commit to buying American farm products and the U.S. would agree to roll back tariffs it has imposed on Chinese imports.</p>
      <p>“It’s not done yet, but there has been very good progress and it’s also been very constructive,” Kudlow said.</p>
