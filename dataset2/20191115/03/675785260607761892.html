      <p>A gang of car thieves who stole high-performance motors were caught after a worried neighbour took a photo of them acting suspiciously.</p>
      <p>The crooks were pictured around a £27,500 Mercedes in Erdington, Birmingham, after a passerby thought they looked shifty.</p>
      <p>Brothers Alimaan and Adnan Hussain and 'gang leader' Sikander Farooq from Stechford handled the stolen cars, pinched from addresses across the West Midlands between 2015 and 2017.</p>
      <p>A court heard how the Mercedes that became their undoing was stolen from a driveway in Cannock, Staffordshire, before being later spotted in Erdington, in what appeared to be an exchange involving four men, the <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/six-men-including-two-erdington-17252399#:~:targetText=The%20court%20was%20told%20Aqeel,and%20co%2Dordinated%20their%20disposal.">Birmingham Mail</a> reports.</p>
      <p>Officers identified the men as Farooq, the Hussain brothers, Nathan Somers and Gavin Hladkiy.</p>
      <p>Their homes were raided and Alimaan Hussain was arrested.</p>

      <p>Alimaan Hussain, Adnan Hussain and Farooq are then believed to have received the vehicles and disposed of them.</p>
