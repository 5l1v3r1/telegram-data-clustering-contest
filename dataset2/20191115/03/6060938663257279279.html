      <p>PUNE: Korean <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Badminton">badminton</a> coach <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kim-Ji-Hyun">Kim Ji Hyun</a>, who left India after <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/pv-sindhu">PV Sindhu</a>'s World Championships gold, is back in action again.</p>
      <p>The coach, who had left the India job citing her husband's health and the resultant emergency situation in New Zealand, has joined an academy in Taiwan.</p>

      <p>Kim was instrumental in preparing Sindhu for the coveted world title, but the coach had to end her stint as India's women's singles coach abruptly, a few days after the World Championships in August.</p>
      <p>The Badminton Association of India (BAI) apparently had tried to get the coach back, but in vain.</p>
      <p>The BAI had said that since Kim wanted to be with her husband, she couldn't continue as India coach. However, in the latest development, the coach was welcomed by the Taiwan academy, Amber Team, a team at Taiwan's Asia-Pacific Badminton academy.</p>
      <p>TOI contacted the management of academy but they refused any comment on the Korean's appointment.</p>
      <p>However, on their Facebook and Instagram pages, the academy management wrote: "Welcome, welcome, welcome. The Amber team is very honoured to invite South Korea's famous coach Kim Ji Hyun to join the Amber Team (sic). Coach Kim at the 1996 Olympics got the fourth place in singles and used to coach in Germany, South Korea, New Zealand and India. She led Indian women's singles player Sindhu to 2019 world gold medal. Welcome to join the Amber family."</p>

      <p>Details of Kim's contract are not known.</p>
      <p>Since Kim left, Sindhu's form has dropped dramatically. In six tournaments after her World title, she has lost consistently in early rounds, failing to win more than two matches in a row.</p>

      <p>Kim seemed instrumental in waking up the attacking beast in Sindhu and urging her to finish rallies quickly. Her animated and precise communication skills appeared to have helped Sindhu discover killer instinct. The Indian star had defeated Tai Tzu Ying, Chen Yu Fei and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Nozomi-Okuhara">Nozomi Okuhara</a> in successive matches at World championship in August.</p>
      <p>Sindhu's father PV Ramana, however, isn't worried about Kim's absence in the Indian set-up and Sindhu's chances to win the gold at Olympics next year. He told TOI: "Coaches play an important role for a player, but ultimately it is the players' hard work that makes most of the difference. A good coach helps players with their inputs during the pressure situation, but it is up to the player to do well."</p>

      <p>When asked if he was upset as the coach left Sindhu in lurch, he replied in negative. "When someone cites health issues of a family member, he or she won't lie. We have to believe that person. Moreover, Sindhu has been training well with her coaches in Hyderabad and she will do well in the coming tournaments," he said.</p>
      <p>Kim is not the first foreign coach to leave without completing her term. Indonesian coach Mulyo Handoyo, who was credited to transform the men's singles players left the team in 2017, citing family reasons. A few months later, he joined Singapore national team.</p>
