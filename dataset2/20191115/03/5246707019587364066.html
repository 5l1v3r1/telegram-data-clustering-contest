      <p>In addition to <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/luigis_mansion_3">Luigi's Mansion 3</a></b> reaching <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/luigis_mansion_3_sets_a_new_launch_month_sales_record_in_the_united_states">third place</a> on the US software charts in October, Nintendo also experienced another strong month in terms of hardware sales.</p>
      <p>While no sales figures were provided, NPD Video Game Industry Analyst Mat Piscatella revealed the Switch was the best-selling hardware platform within this region. It also remains the best-selling platform of 2019 and most-likely experienced a boost in sales due to the release of the Switch Lite during the previous month.</p>
      <p>Piscatella noted how the Switch experienced sales gains during October, despite the fact overall hardware spending fell in this month and year-to-date:</p>
      <blockquote>October 2019 hardware spending fell 41% vs YA, to $182m. Year-to-date hardware spending has declined 23% vs YA, to $2.1 billion. Nintendo Switch is the only platform with sales gains both in October as well as year to date.</blockquote>
