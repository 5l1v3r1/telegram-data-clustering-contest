      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 15 — Two officials from the Korean fire department have been removed from their positions for leaking information about the death of Kpop star Sulli.</p>
      <p>Korean pop culture website <i>Soompi</i> reported that the information leaked by the officials were details such as time and location of her death.</p>
      <p>“It was leaked onto social media and subsequently shared on portal sites and blogs.”</p>
      <p>“On October 17, Gyeonggi Provincial Fire &amp; Disaster Headquarters held a press conference to officially apologise for the leak,” the portal reported.</p>
      <p>On Thursday (November 14), Gyeonggi Provincial Fire &amp; Disaster Headquarters chief Lee Hyung Chul stated that following an administrative audit by the Gyeonggi Province Assembly’s Security and Public Administration Committee, two individuals who leaked the information have been removed from their positions. </p>
      <p>“We have (also) made a request to the Gyeonggi Nambu Provincial Police Agency to investigate the matter. We will decide [on the degree of disciplinary action to be taken] once the results of the police investigation are announced,” he was quoted as saying.</p>
      <p>Lee added that following the incident, the headquarters had made some adjustments.</p>
      <p>“Previously, the report was accessible by all fire officers. Now, we have made it more secure by only allowing the employee in charge and their senior official (access) to directly report to each other,” he said.</p>
      <p>Sulli was found dead in a bedroom on the second floor of her home by her manager on October 14 after failing to contact her.</p>
