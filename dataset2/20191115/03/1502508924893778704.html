      <p>The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/air-quality">air quality </a>in Delhi-NCR remained in "severe" category on Friday morning as blame game continued betweeen political parties for the crisis.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, political blame game continued over the situation in Delhi and nearby regions with the AAP hitting out at the Centre for not taking "concrete steps" to tackle the menace despite the apex court's directions in this regard.</p>
      <p>Senior AAP leader Sanjay Singh alleged that the BJP is trying to "politicise" a sensitive issue.</p>

        <b>HC pulls up Delhi govt, suggests clutch of measures</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Delhi High Court on Thursday pulled up the AAP-led Delhi government and other authorities over increasing air pollution levels in the city and suggested a clutch of measures to bring it down.</p>
      <p>The court said the problem lies in the complete lack of will showed by the authorities to implement the ideas to bring down the levels of air pollution.</p>
      <p>The bench suggested a series of measures and said during the months of October till January no fresh infrastructure should be demolished. It also asked the authorities to take steps to ensure that the building materials are not left uncovered.</p>
      <p>To tackle the streamlining of the traffic in the city, it asked the New Delhi Municipal Corporation and other municipal corporations to take necessary steps to deal with encroachment on the roads.</p>
