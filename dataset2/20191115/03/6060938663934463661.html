      <h1>England, France reach Euro 2020; Cristiano Ronaldo keeps Portugal in the race</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T03:40:18+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 03:40</time> by <a rel="author">AP</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/England">England</a> qualified in style for the 2020 European Championship, while the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Czech-Republic">Czech Republic</a>, France and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Turkey">Turkey</a> also booked their places Thursday at next year's tournament.</p>
      <p>England only needed a draw to qualify but <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Harry-Kane">Harry Kane</a> scored a hat trick in a 7-0 win over Montenegro, and the Czech Republic also advanced from Group A by beating Kosovo 2-1.</p>
      <p>The result also meant that England, playing their 1,000th game, clinched top spot in the group thanks to their record against the Czech Republic. They won 5-0 at Wembley in March before losing 2-1 in Prague last month.</p>
      <p>"The important thing is we have qualified," Kane told ITV after the game. "We've had one slip-up in the whole group and responded really well to the defeat and got the job done.</p>
      <p>"We wanted to put on a show in the 1,000th game and the score at halftime (5-0) really showed that. I think we were expected to win the group, as we have done, but <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/delhi-dynamos">football</a> is never easy and there are a lot of upsets."</p>
      <p>Cristiano Ronaldo also scored a hat trick, in Portugal's 6-0 win over Lithuania, to keep the defending champions in contention for one of the top two spots in Group B.</p>
      <p>Iceland's earlier draw in Istanbul had already ensured France and Turkey were through from Group H.</p>
      <p>
        <b>HAT-TRICK HERO</b>
      </p>
      <p>All three of Kane's goals came in the first half as the Tottenham forward became the first player to score a hat-trick in successive appearances at Wembley -- having also scored a treble against Bulgaria in September.</p>
      <p>The landmark night was completed by Tammy Abraham's first England goal, six minutes from time.</p>
      <p>Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain scored the opener in the 11th minute and Marcus Rashford also netted in the first half to help England to a 5-0 advantage at half-time.</p>
      <p>After a flood of goals in the first half, the Montenegro net was only breached after the break by Aleksandar Sofranac's own-goal and Abraham in the 84th.</p>
      <p>England will be back at Wembley at the finals, with three group-stage games at the national stadium, which is one of 12 venues being used by UEFA in 12 cities across Europe.</p>
      <p>The semifinals and final are also at Wembley in July 2020.</p>
      <p>The Czech Republic needed to win to join England but had a scare when Atdhe Nuhiu headed Kosovo into a surprise lead five minutes after the interval.</p>
      <p>But Alex Kral curled in a stunning equalizer in the 71st and Ondrej Celustka scored what was to prove the crucial goal for the Czechs eight minutes later.</p>
      <p>
        <b>RAMPAGING RONALDO</b>
      </p>
      <p>Cristiano Ronaldo hadn't scored in his last three club matches after playing with a knee injury.</p>
      <p>But the Juventus forward showed little sign of any problems as he came to his country's aid on Thursday, reaching 98 national goals in the process.</p>
      <p>It was the ninth hat-trick with Portugal for Ronaldo, and the 55th of his career for club and country.</p>
      <p>He has 10 goals in seven qualifying matches.</p>
      <p>Pizzi Fernandes, Goncalo Paciencia and Bernardo Silva also scored for Portugal, which can qualify with a win in their final Group B match on Sunday at Luxembourg.</p>
      <p>The rout against last-place Lithuania gave Portugal 14 points, five fewer than group leaders Ukraine, who have already qualified, and one point more than third-place Serbia, who beat Luxembourg 3-2.</p>
      <p>
        <b>FRANCE WIN</b>
      </p>
      <p>Iceland needed to beat Group H leader Turkey to stay in the running for a direct berth in next year's tournament but drew 0-0.</p>
      <p>Hordur Magnusson came close for Iceland, eight minutes from time, but his effort from a corner was blocked on the line by Turkey defender Merih Demiral.</p>
      <p>The result meant France had already qualified before its 2-1 win over Moldova.</p>
      <p>Vadim Rata fired Moldova into a surprise lead in the ninth minute but Raphael Varane leveled in the 35th and Olivier Giroud converted a penalty 11 minutes from time.</p>
      <p>Also, Albania drew 2-2 at home to Andorra, who hadn't scored an away goal in a competitive match in more than nine years.</p>
