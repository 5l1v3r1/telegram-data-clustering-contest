      <h1>Catcher sees strong momentum from smartphone sector</h1>

      <p>Metal-alloy chassis maker Catcher Technology has seen orders from the smartphone sector continue ramping up, with the momentum likely to last into the first quarter of 2020, according to company chairman Allen Hung. Catcher is reportedly among the suppliers for Apple's iPhone 11 lineup.</p>
      <p>Despite headwinds earlier in 2019 dragging down it gross margin to 23.7% for the first three quarters of the year from 40% seen in the previous years, increased orders from the smartphone sector helped push its gross margin to 26% in October, Hung said.</p>
      <p>Now that inventory at the channels have returned to healthy levels, and that Catcher's capacity utilization rate have also rebounded, Hung said that he expects his company's gross margin to return to over 30% in the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Catcher also sees looming challenges and opportunities in the coming 5G era, as designs of components for 5G phones will become more complicated. Requirements for heat dissipation to accomodate high-speed transmission and an increase in the numbers of antennas will lead to significant changes in chassis design, Hung said.</p>
      <p>Catcher posted revenues of NT$12.117 billion (US$396.94 million) for October, down 5.66% on year. Year-to-date revenues totaled NT$71.813 billion, decreasing 9.21% from a year earlier, according to company data.</p>
