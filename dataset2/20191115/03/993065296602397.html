      <p>A British author has scooped an international history book prize worth more than £58,000.</p>
      <p>Julia Lovell has been named the winner of the 2019 Cundill History Prize for Maoism: A Global History.</p>
      <p>The British historian, China expert and translator of Chinese literature was awarded the 75,000 dollars prize (£58,414) at a gala at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts in Canada.</p>
      <p>Alan Taylor, chair of the jury, called the book “an exceptional work of history.”</p>

      <p>“Her book will dazzle readers with lucid and vivid insights into the power of a protean, and often deadly, ideology – and its enduring impact on our world today,” he said.</p>
      <p>The international prize, run by McGill University in Canada, relaunched three years ago.</p>
      <p>Lovell is Professor of modern China at Birkbeck College, University of London.</p>
      <p>Harvard Professor Maya Jasanoff won the award for The Dawn Watch in 2018, and the British historian Daniel Beer for The House Of The Dead in 2017.</p>
