      <p>Becker, who won his first major title at Wimbledon in 1985, was chosen by world No. 7 Alexander Zverev to captain Germany, who are drawn in Group F alongside Greece, Canada and hosts Australia and play their matches in Brisbane.</p>
      <p>The 24-nation ATP Cup will take place from Jan. 3-12 in Brisbane, Perth and Sydney.</p>
      <p>“We have a strong chance in an extremely competitive section of the draw,” Becker said in an ATP Cup media release.</p>
      <p>“Playing against the very best and representing your country sets the tone, sets the sport. I think we’re going to see amazing tennis.”</p>
      <p>Safin, who won the U.S. Open in 2000 and the centenary Australian Open five years later, will lead a Russian team that includes world No. 4 Daniil Medvedev and No. 17 Karen Khachanov.</p>
      <p>“We have a real chance of winning the first Cup with the caliber of players we have in the Russian side and I’ll be doing everything I can to make that happen from the bench,” he said.</p>
      <p>Russia face Italy, the United States and Norway in Group D and will play their group games in Perth.</p>
      <p>Muster, who claimed the world’s top ranking in 1996 after winning the French Open the previous year, was chosen as captain by world No. 5 Dominic Thiem and welcomed the opportunity to lock horns with his former adversaries.</p>
      <p>“The ATP Cup brings some old rivals together as captains,” he said. “The cream of tennis is competing across Australia and the player field is incredibly strong, I feel very excited to be part of it all.”</p>
      <p>The winners of the six groups and the two best second-placed finishers reach the ATP Cup Finals in Sydney. Each tie comprises two singles and one doubles match.</p>
