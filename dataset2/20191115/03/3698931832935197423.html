      <p>If you need to go to Mid Valley Megamall or The Gardens Mall, there’s now an easier way to get there without being stuck in traffic. After years of waiting, the link bridge between KL Eco City and The Gardens Mall is now open to the public, and it provides covered access to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/o1rDJSE3g7SV6n9D7">Abdullah Hukum station</a> on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelana_Jaya_line">Kelana Jaya LRT line</a>. It is also connected to the Abdullah Hukum station on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Klang_Line">Port Klang Komuter Line</a> that was <a href="https://www.edgeprop.my/content/1441911/abdullah-hukum-train-station-kl-eco-city-opened">opened last year</a>.</p>

      <p>Previously, the only rail link to the popular mall was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid_Valley_Komuter_station">Mid Valley station</a> on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seremban_Line">Seremban Komuter Line</a>. Unfortunately, it isn’t a favourite choice as the Komuter service isn’t as frequent as other forms of public transport like the LRT and MRT.</p>
      <p>The Abdullah Hukum LRT station, which is less than 300 metres away from The Gardens Mall, will provide commuters seamless access to other key stations. This includes KL Sentral, Pasar Seni, KLCC, Gombak, Subang Jaya and Putra Heights without changing trains. For those heading to KLIA from Mid Valley, you can get on the KLIA Express from KL Sentral, which is only two stops away from Abdullah Hukum via LRT.</p>

      <p>In The Gardens Mall, the entrance to the link bridge is <a href="https://thegardensmall.com.my/floor-guide/">located</a> on the 1st floor between Isetan and Ichiriki Japanese Restaurant.</p>
      <p>The 70 metres covered bridge was delayed as the original bridge had <a href="https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2016/11/30/kl-eco-city-developer-confirms-one-death-in-pedestrian-bridge-collapse/1262005">collapsed</a> in November 2016. The new bridge was <a href="https://www.thestar.com.my/metro/metro-news/2019/10/05/link-bridge-to-ensure-mall-goers-safety">completed</a> in early 2019 but it was pending necessary approvals and inspections by the relevant authorities including Kuala Lumpur City Hall and the Fire and Rescue Department. Those that wanted to take the LRT previously had to walk along the busy road via the old bridge located further away from the station. This is not only inconvenient but it also endangers their safety.</p>
      <p>The next time you’re planning to go to Mid Valley, why not take the LRT instead? An LRT ride from KL Sentral to Abdullah Hukum station costs RM1.50 if you use the TNG card (RM1.60 by token), while KLCC to the same station costs RM2.70 with TNG card (RM3.10 by token).</p>
      <p>For frequent commuters, you can always get a <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2018/12/01/rapidkl-unlimited-travel-pass/">My100 unlimited travel card</a> at RM100/month, which is offered only to Malaysian residents. For short-term travellers, RapidKL had recently introduced its <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2019/04/23/rapidkl-mycity-unlimited-daily-lrt-mrt-brt-pass/">MyCity pass</a> which provides unlimited rides from RM15/day.</p>
