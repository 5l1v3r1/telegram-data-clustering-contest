      <h1>Steve Nicol's advice for Jadon Sancho amid Liverpool and Man Utd transfer links</h1>
      <h2>Nicol says Sancho would be 'crazy' to join United and wants to see him at Liverpool instead - but says winger would have to alter his mindset</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T03:58:58+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 03:58</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool legend Steve Nicol reckons Jadon Sancho would be 'crazy' to join Manchester United - but says a move to Anfield for the £100million-rated star could be "huge".</p>
      <p>England ace Sancho has been linked with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> after reportedly deciding <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/liverpool-man-utd-transfer-target-20877649">he wants to leave Borussia Dortmund</a> .</p>
      <p>Sancho, who gave Montenegro's defence nightmares with his pace and trickery during England's 7-0 Euro 2020 qualifying win on Thursday, is also believed to be on Chelsea's radar.</p>
      <p>Former Liverpool defender Nicol would love to see the 19-year-old winger playing for Jurgen Klopp's side - but says the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> youth product would have to understand that he'd have to wait for a first-team chance.</p>
      <p>Super-confident <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jadon-sancho">Sancho</a> left City for Dortmund in 2017 in search of first-team football - and his decision was vindicated as he became a key part of the Bundesliga club's team and broke into the England set-up.</p>

      <p>And Nicol fears his desire to play first-team football would scupper any hopes of a move to Liverpool.</p>
      <p>However, he also warned Sancho against moving to rivals United, who are currently struggling to assert themselves as a Premier League force.</p>
      <p>“I think he’s crazy if he goes to Man United,” Nicol told ESPN FC.</p>
      <p>“We’re talking about he’s struggling in a team that’s struggling [Dortmund] - Man United are going to be struggling for a couple of seasons, so I would stay away from there.”</p>

      <p>Asked where he thought Sancho should go, Nicol added: “Well if I was advising him, let me put it that way, I would like to see him at Liverpool.</p>
      <p>“I think he would be fantastic. If he could get his head round playing second fiddle to [Sadio] Mane and [Mohamed] Salah, then that would be huge for Liverpool in my opinion.</p>
      <p>“They could save the legs of both of those two and kind of swap the three of them in and out.</p>
      <p>“But he’s not going to do that, he’s going to go somewhere to play. So I think Liverpool’s out.”</p>
