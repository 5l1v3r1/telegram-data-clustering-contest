      <p><b>Maserati</b> has announced its upcoming sports car will be revealed in <b>May 2020.</b></p>
      <p>Details about the '<a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/780358/maserati-new-sports-car-coming-next-year/">sports car</a>' are hard to come by at the moment, but a teaser video posted on Twitter offers a few hints beyond the launch date.</p>
      <p>For one, it features a revving petrol engine, suggesting the first electrified <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/maserati/">Maserati</a> won't be a pure-electric vehicle – instead, it's likely to be a plug-in hybrid, or offer a purely internal-combustion powertrain option option.</p>
      <p>Reports from earlier this year claimed the sports car – which may be called <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/maserati-alfieri/">Alfieri</a> – will be built on a modular aluminium space-frame chassis designed to support fully- and partially-electrified powertrains.</p>

      <p>The most powerful model is expected to be a three-motor, all-wheel drive electric model capable of hitting 100km/h in around two seconds.</p>
      <p>The sports car will be joined by a convertible version <b>in 2021</b>, according to Maserati's latest earnings report. Also on the cards are refreshed <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/maserati/levante/">Levante</a>, <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/maserati/ghibli/">Ghibli</a>, and <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/maserati/quattroporte/">Quattroporte</a> models in 2020.</p>
      <p>An all-new <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/maserati/granturismo/">GranTurismo</a> is also expected to follow in 2021, with a new <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/maserati/grancabrio/">GranCabrio</a> and Quattroporte to come in 2022.</p>
