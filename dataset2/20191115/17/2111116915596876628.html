      <h3>The best laptops for programming</h3>
      <p>(Image credit: Future)</p>
      <p>If you’re looking for the best laptop for programming, you’ve come to the right place. We found all the best laptops for software developers like you, whether you’re trying your hand at HTML, CSS, JavaScript or VB.</p>
      <p>Before you go through are list, bear in mind that are a few things you need to think about before you buy the best laptop for programming. </p>
      <p>First, you’re going to need one of the best processors, as that horsepower goes a long way when you’re compiling code. Most modern laptops will feature plenty of cores, threads and high clock speeds, but you should focus on getting the fastest processor you can afford. </p>
      <p>Then there’s the memory. You absolutely need at least 8GB, and it needs to be fast. Think about storage as well: one of the best SSDs is essential, as it will shave minutes off your project with all the files and apps you’ll use. </p>
      <p>You won’t necessarily need the fastest graphics chip on the market, as modern Intel hardware comes with integrated graphics that are more than good enough for anything you’ll encounter while programming. However, if you want to do some gaming in your down time, go for it. </p>
      <p>Oh, and do yourself a favor and make sure you’re getting one of the best keyboards. As programming involves a lot of typing, you need a keyboard with excellent travel and superior comfort. And, a high resolution display will help make sure that it's easy on the eyes, as you’ll be spending a lot of hours and then some staring at it. </p>
      <p>Taking all that in consideration, find the best laptop for programming that suits you best in our list below.</p>

      <p>Sometimes you just have to work on the go, and in those situations, you’ll be thankful for the Microsoft Surface Pro 6. With its quad-core processors and plentitude of RAM, you’ll be able to compile code quickly and efficiently, even when you’re on the move. Just keep in mind that you’ll have to pay extra for the Type Cover – you’re not going to want to get any coding done on a touch screen, trust us. While Microsoft has released the Surface Pro 7, we actually think the Pro 6 is the better choice for programmers, as the hardware isn't the different – but the price is.</p>

      <p>+  Beautiful design <br/>+  Awesome keyboard <br/>-  Chrome OS not as refined as other operating systems </p>
      <p>Yes, a Chromebook (or two) has made our best laptop for programming list. That’s because Google Pixelbook is powerful (and beautiful) enough to contend with the Surfaces and MacBooks of the world. Admittedly, the ChromeOS is not as good a place to program as Windows or macOS. However, the Pixelbook’s support of Android makes it a must-own laptop for any Android developer. The fact that this laptop succeeds the discontinued Google Chromebook Pixel, which was designed by and for Google’s own developers, should give it some credibility in the eyes of coders.</p>
