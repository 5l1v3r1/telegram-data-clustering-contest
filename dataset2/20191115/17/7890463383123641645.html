      <h1>Here’s where Xur is in Destiny 2 today, and what you should buy from him</h1>

        <b>Xûr is Destiny 2’s Exotic gear merchant. He appears every weekend to sell the game’s most coveted items in exchange for Legendary shards, but if you’re a casual player with limited shards to spend, it can be hard to know which of his wares is most worth your investment. That’s where we come in.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Xûr appears every Friday at 17:00 GMT (9:00 Pacific), and will stick around until the Tuesday reset. We’ll update this guide shortly after he arrives, so if you’re reading this, you need only read on to learn where he is, and which are the best items he’s selling this week. Ever since the Forsaken expansion, Xûr’s icon no longer appears on your director, so he’s not quite as easy to track down as he used to be. That said, his appearances in the EDZ, Titan, Nessus, Io, and The Tower have so far been in the same places he frequented in vanilla Destiny 2. So if you’ve been following Destiny 2 from the start, you should have no problem finding the merchant’s spots.</p>
      <p>Xûr is back on Io this week, at Giant’s Scar. He is selling:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Prometheus Lens,</b> an Exotic energy trace rifle, for 29 legendary shards</li>
        <li><b>Mask of the Quiet One,</b> an Exotic Titan helmet, for 23 legendary shards</li>
        <li><b>Skull of Dire Ahamkara</b><b>,</b>  an Exotic Warlock helmet, for 23 legendary shards</li>
        <li><b>Ophidia Spathe,</b> Exotic Hunter chest armour, for 23 legendary shards</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Prometheus Lens </b>(not Riskrunner, despite today’s glitch) is perhaps the most infamously broken, overpowered gun in Destiny 2 – though, sadly, that ridiculous weekend when the weapon ruled Crucible is done for. Thankfully, it’s still a solid choice particularly since the rebalance, with a perk that provides growing damage as long as the weapon continues to fire. More generous ammo drops mean it’s mostly useful in PvE, though some careful play can make it a strong choice in Crucible, particularly in team fight situations.</p>

      <p><b>Mask of the Quiet One</b> is a very menacing Titan helm that grants ability energy when you take damage, and regnerates health when you inflict Void ability damage. Only Sentinels will benefit from the latter half of this ability, which synergises with its first half, encouraging an aggressive playstyle that can be risky but fun. We’re not sure the ability regen is substantial enough to make it a top-tier pick, but it’s certainly worth a purchase if you play Sentinel a lot.</p>
      <p><b>Skull of Dire Ahamkara</b> is a Warlock helmet that provides additional damage resistance while casting Nova Bomb, and will cause Nova Bomb kills to grant super energy. Community testing suggests that each enemy killed will regen roughly 10% of your Super (here’s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW4Hfko_sWI%0A%0A%20">video</a> showing five kills equals half the bar), which is a pretty decent boost in PvE. Pair with the Bloom perk tree for extra explosions. It’s harder to recommend in PvP simply because you’ll be killing fewer enemies in each cast, but the extra damage resistance should at least guarantee you get it off. Overall it’s a nice boon for your Super in regular or solo PvE, but in the raid you shouldn’t need any extra help to get your Super up for damage phases and so on – your team should be making enough orbs for that. If you’ve got Nezarec’s Sin or even Eye of Another World, Skull of Dire Ahamkara falls more into the ‘nice to have’ category.</p>
      <p><b>Ophidia Spathe</b> gives you two extra knives per charge, which is a pretty self-explanatory sort of perk. If you’re able to make effective use of knives, it’ll greatly expand your offensive capability, but if not you’re better off looking elsewhere. It’s a solid pick if your build supports it.</p>
