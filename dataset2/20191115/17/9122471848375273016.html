      <h1>NFL Announces Suspensions For Myles Garrett, Maurkice Pouncey, Larry Ogunjobi</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:04:44+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>On Thursday night, the Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers faced off in a pivotal AFC North battle with playoff implications on the line.</p>
      <p>What should have been a great rivalry game turned ugly in the final second. Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph dumped off a pass to running back Trey Edmunds when he was tackled by Browns defensive end Myles Garrett.</p>
      <p>Rudolph and Garrett then tussled on the ground before Garrett ripped the helmet off of <a href="https://thespun.com/nfl/afc-north/cleveland-browns/video-myles-garrett-ejected-after-swinging-helmet-at-mason-rudolph">Rudolph and then hit him with it</a>. Several Steelers players jumped in to help their quarterback</p>
      <p>On Friday morning, the NFL announced the punishment for all players involved.</p>
      <p>Myles Garrett has been suspended indefinitely – for at least the rest of the 2019 season, including the playoffs. Fellow Browns defensive lineman Larry Ogunjobi received a one-game suspension for a late hit on Rudolph after the initial incident.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Maurkice Pouncey received a three-game suspension.</p>
      <p>Here’s the full announcement from the NFL.</p>

      <p>As for Mason Rudolph, the NFL announced “additional discipline for other players will be forthcoming.”</p>
      <p>Cleveland sits at 4-6 on the season after the win, but still has a long way to go for a potential playoff run. If the Browns sneak into the playoffs, their star defensive end won’t be available.</p>
      <p>Pittsburgh and Cleveland face off again in just two weeks.</p>
      <p>Stay tuned for the latest.</p>
