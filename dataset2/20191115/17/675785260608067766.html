      <h2>Chris Powell is now part of Gareth Southgate's England set-up and trying to help the next generation of black footballers, such as Raheem Sterling and Marcus Rashford</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author">John Cross, https://www.facebook.com/johncrossmirror/</a></address>
      <p>Chris Powell can still remember a time when his mum and dad would be reluctant to go and watch him as a player.</p>
      <p>These days, Powell is trying to be a trailblazer as a coach in Gareth Southgate’s England set-up and those appalling days of widespread racism within football are supposed to be a distant memory.</p>
      <p>But former England full back Powell, 50, is still trying to lead by example for a future generation of managers and coaches with his role with the FA while stadiums should be safer now than 30 years ago.</p>
      <p>Powell, recalling days of playing during the late 1980s and 90s, said: “If things are going to improve for future generations I want to be part of that. I always felt like I wanted to be in football, I still want to be in it, and actually I want to make it better for others, I really do.</p>

      <p>“I remember playing for Southend when Dave Webb was manager and we played up north, I won't say where, and there were three black players and for 90 minutes we got it, as such.</p>
      <p>“I remember afterwards the three of us were quite shaken - we had got on with the game - but I remember looking at his face, he looked at us and said: 'whatever happens I am with you.'</p>
      <p>“That was so powerful and I will never forget it because we couldn't go anywhere with it but he was our manager and he was there to support us.</p>
      <p>“This was at a time when you couldn't really do much about it, nothing was being done as much as these days.</p>

      <p>“It was a different time, I accept that, people's views in football and society were very, very different. I know we still have issues now but football was very, very different back then.</p>
      <p>“My dad wouldn’t go. No chance. He wouldn’t go. He wouldn’t go from a safety aspect, I don’t know. My mum would come when I was a manager, she came more when I was managing than when I played. But you get supported now and it is a bit safer in the main.”</p>
      <p>Powell is a hugely likeable man, always calm and well respected both as player and coach. Having started at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> , he had spells at Charlton, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> and, most memorable, got an England call-up from nowhere after Sven Goran Eriksson took charge.</p>
      <p>That was perhaps a nod to a steady, reliable player who was respected by his team mates but did not always get the recognition he deserved.</p>

      <p>Having managed Charlton, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/huddersfield-town-fc">Huddersfield</a> and Southend, perhaps there is some symmetry now with his role as BAME coach in Southgate’s set-up with the FA idea of appointing a black coach for every England team through the age groups.</p>
      <p>Powell has immediately blended in within Southgate’s team but also hopes that he can make a difference and pave the way for other black coaches to make their way in the game. It is glaringly obvious that not enough black players become managers.</p>
      <p>Powell said: “I suppose there will be an argument that it could have happened years ago but I look at it in a different way and let’s look to the present and the future.</p>
      <p>“We can’t deal with much what happened in the past, all we can do maybe do is try to be positive as we can, show people its’ achievable.</p>

      <p>“In many ways, I feel that what I’m doing and for many others - the next generation and the generation after that - we have to have a starting point, we have to begin somewhere, we can’t right the wrongs of the past. We can’t do that. What we can do is make things right now.</p>
      <p>“It’s very tough, I understand that, there are people who don’t want to go into the managerial world because it can be tough.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes you get one opportunity and that’s it. You have to deal with setbacks, you have to deal with them as a player, you certainly have to deal with them as a manager.</p>
      <p>“Actually, it doesn’t matter about the colour of your skin, I think the managerial world is if you don’t get the results, you lose your job.</p>
      <p>“But I feel some people, and there’s always been coaches of colour, but sometimes they just want to stay at the academy level because they feel they can build a career there, they can stay there, they can stay in the game.</p>
      <p>“As a manager, the old saying is that you’re six games away. If you don’t win for six games, you’re under pressure. Some people don’t want that.”</p>
