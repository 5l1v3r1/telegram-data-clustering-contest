      <h1>'A double standard like never seen before': Trump reacts to Roger Stone being found guilty</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:38:57+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:38</time> by <a rel="author">Zachary Halaschak</a></address>
      <p>President Trump took to Twitter and blasted his perceived enemies after former associate <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/dirty-trickster-roger-stone-found-guilty-of-lying-to-congress-in-wikileaks-case">Roger Stone was found guilty of lying to Congress and witness intimidation</a>.</p>
      <p>Trump appeared to defend Stone, 67, by contrasting his conviction to a number of people involved in former special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into the 2016 presidential election.</p>
      <p>“So they now convict Roger Stone of lying and want to jail him for many years to come. Well, what about Crooked Hillary, Comey, Strzok, Page, McCabe, Brennan, Clapper, Shifty Schiff, Ohr &amp; Nellie, Steele &amp; all of the others, including even Mueller himself? Didn’t they lie?” Trump said.</p>
      <p>“A double standard like never seen before in the history of our Country?” he added.</p>

      <p>Stone was found guilty Thursday on five separate counts of lying to the House Intelligence Committee and two more charges of obstructing a congressional investigation and intimidating a witness. The case was a spinoff from <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/read-robert-muellers-redacted-russia-report">Mueller’s Trump-Russia investigation</a>.</p>
