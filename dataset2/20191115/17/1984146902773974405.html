      <h1>Children given bikes as part of a generous charity and business collaboration</h1>
      <h2>Recyke y'Bike, in Newcastle, is providing bikes for children from disadvantaged backgrounds, with the help of donations from North East businesses</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:43:11+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:43</time> by <a rel="author">Nicole Goodwin</a></address>
      <p>A generous charity is providing bikes for children in the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/">North East</a> , who may otherwise miss out on the opportunity to have their own.</p>
      <p>David Gray Solicitors, in Newcastle, and ARP Design, in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/gateshead">Gateshead</a> , are among the businesses in the region who have donated money and held fundraisers, to enable the charity to repair and deliver the bikes to deserving children.</p>
      <p>Through the scheme, Recyke y'Bike, in Byker, has brought happiness to children from low income families or disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>
      <p>In one giveaway, the charity were able to replace a bike that had been awarded for good attendance, and later stolen from outside of the child's home.</p>

      <p>Mesk Ali Mohamed Idie, aged 12, and Yahya Ali Mohamed Idie, aged seven, are some of the latest children to receive bikes from the charity.</p>
      <p>The young family fled from Somalia to Egypt, before moving to the UK in July. The family are now settling in to their new home in Leam Lane, Gateshead.</p>
      <p>Mother, Amina Ahmed, said: “This is the first time the children have ever had a bike. It makes me so happy to see the children with their bikes.”</p>
      <p>It is hoped that the bikes will help the children become integrated into their new community, and allow them to make friends with other children in the area.</p>
      <p>Mesk, who has aspirations of becoming a doctor or a teacher, said: “I feel so happy to have received this bike today and when I learn to ride, I want to help my brother to ride his bike.</p>
      <p>“I’m looking forward to riding my bike to <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/education">school</a> as many of my friends at school also ride bikes.”</p>

      <p>Joanne Murray, refugee resettlement worker at the Gateshead Housing Company, helped to deliver the bikes to the children she has been working with since their arrival to the country.</p>
      <p>She said: “When the families arrive, they don’t really have toys or possessions as they haven’t been able to bring much with them.”</p>
      <p>After watching the Syrian refugee crisis on the TV, Joanne decided to work with refugees, as she was moved by the terrible conditions people are facing in other countries.</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old, adds: “Having a bike means they can go outside and play, and not be stuck indoors so much.</p>
      <p>“It will give them a chance to explore the community and keep <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/health/">active</a> , so it makes me really happy to see the children and mum happy.”</p>
      <p>Sara Newson, general manager at Recyke y'Bike, said: “We're passionate about getting more people on to bikes. We love being able to give them to children who don't have the chance to have a bike, as we believe it's an important rite of passage.</p>
      <p>“It provides freedom, independence and fun, and it also helps to establish cycling as a habit, which we hope stays with them into adulthood.</p>
      <p>“It's wonderful to be able to help people in such a practical way, and the ability to put a smile on a child's face makes our day.”</p>
