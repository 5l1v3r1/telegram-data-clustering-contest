      <p>The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has set up an Online Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (OCSAE) Prevention/Investigation Unit.</p>
      <p>It will also probe such offences covered under various provisions of the IPC, the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act and the Information Technology Act, apart from other relevant laws.</p>
      <p>The unit, which will function under the agency's Special Crime Zone in Delhi, will collect and disseminate information on online child sexual abuse and exploitation.</p>
      <p>“Numerous references related to dissemination of CSAM [Child Sexual Abuse Material] are received from the Interpol and other national/international organisations. The incidence of online child sexual abuse and exploitation generally transcends international borders,” said the agency, adding that the unit's territorial jurisdiction would be throughout the country.</p>
