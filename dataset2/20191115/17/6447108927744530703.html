      <h1>What We Played #425 – Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, Death Stranding &amp; XO19</h1>

      <p>May the force be with you! Or will you be catching them all? (Or at least, some of them). Today could well be the most exciting day of the year if you like things with laser swords or pocket monsters of the sword or shield variety. I suppose there’s an outside chance you’re going to pick up Terminator Resistance, but you might want to wait for Monday when our review will likely pop up…</p>
      <p>Personally I’m going to make a start on Star Wars: Fallen Order very soon myself, but it’s time to ask what we’ve played this week, and I’ve been dabbling with some Planet Zoo, Kingdom Under Fire II, NBA 2K20 and even a spot of Halo 5 via the pretty impressive Project xCloud.</p>
      <p><b>Jason</b> can’t talk about what he’s played as he’s legally obliged not too (by which he means he’s not really played anything). <b>Aran </b>meanwhile has played more Red Dead Redemption 2. “I’m quite near the end of the game I believe so I’m running around completing all of the stranger quests before getting to the end of the story. It has such a great world to explore, but I wish there was more player agency so you could approach missions in your own way.”</p>
      <p><b>Jim </b>has spent this week with a few games on rotation, starting with Rainbow Six Siege and For Honor. “Both have just entered their latest seasons and it’s great to see Ubisoft continuing to support them long after release with free new content, despite one game being perhaps a tad more popular than the other. I also played a load of Jedi.” Make sure you catch his <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/11/15/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review-ps4-xbox-pc/">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order review</a>!</p>
      <p><b>Nic B </b>has played a “tonne of Deemo”. He’s also tried his hand at the early access build of Minecraft Earth, saying “It is groundbreaking in the literal sense, because Minecraft, but it’s not exactly good right now. Hopefully they will build this into an interesting game, but I’m not sold…”</p>
      <p><b>Ade</b> finished off Yaga for review and has mixed feelings that we’ll hear about next week, while <b>Nick P</b> ploughed more time into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/11/13/need-for-speed-heat-review-ps4-pro-xbox-one-pc/">Need for Speed Heat</a> for our review. “I have a very powerful Mustang which is probably my favorite car of all time. I’ve also been playing Death Stranding, but I’m saving my thoughts on that till I’m done with it. I will say it’s like nothing you’ve ever played.”</p>
      <p><b>Miguel </b>spent his week playing video games all day every day “for like, what feels like the first time in ages. I blasted through all of AI The Somnium Files and <i>loved</i> it, and I’m halfway through Control right now, on top of maybe 8-ish hours or more into Death Stranding.”</p>
      <p>Coming back to Red Dead 2, <b>Gamoc</b> finished off the main story, “which was good, but too long.” He also played Last Labyrinth for review, some Killing Floor 2 and completed the latest Modern Warfare campaign, “which was good, stressful, and way too short.” Maybe there’s a Goldilocks of a video game for him to play next?</p>
      <p><b>Steve </b>has been playing quite a few smaller games after the heartbreak of that FFX save. “I rattled through the charming Fe, the fun Colour Guardians, the surprisingly good My Big Sister (Ratalaika games aren’t normally great), got a chunk into Back in 1995, cleared Moons of Madness and Song of Horror episode 1 and then spent a really enjoyable evening with Sparklite. I’ve admitted defeat for the moment with my platinum quest on Horizon Chase Turbo as the Master tournaments were proving too frustrating for me but I’ll go back at some point.”</p>
      <p>And finally, <b>Tef</b> stepped away from Luigi’s Mansion 3 in order to go back to the original game on 3DS last weekend, in and around playing an awful lot of Destiny 2. But yesterday he was at XO19, getting the skinny on Microsoft’s plans for the future, playing some <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/11/15/grounded-preview-honey-obsidian-shrunk-the-kids/">Grounded</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/11/15/heres-24-minutes-of-halo-reach-pc-gameplay-in-4k/">Halo: Reach</a>, a spot of Microsoft Flight Simulator with a ludicrous controller set up, Project xCloud, and a few other things alongside. You’ll hear his thoughts on these soon.</p>
      <p>What about you? What have you played? And will you be tucking into Star Wars or Pokemon this weekend?</p>
