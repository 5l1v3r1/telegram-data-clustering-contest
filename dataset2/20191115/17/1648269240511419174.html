      <p>We’ll start in Germany, where <a href="https://www.motor1.com/bmw/">BMW</a> is set to offer price discounts and better lease deals on just about every crossover in the company’s lineup. Lease specifics aren’t spelled out, but crossovers will get $2,000 to $2,500 price discounts and special finance rates. In addition, some models offer an additional $1,000 bonus if you own a competitor’s vehicle. Speaking of which, <a href="https://www.motor1.com/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz </a>is dropping up to $15,000 in dealer cash for discounts on the 2019 <a href="https://www.motor1.com/mercedes-benz/s-class-sedan/">S-Class</a>, though admittedly it’s a rather pricey model to start with. Other models like the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/mercedes-benz/glc-class/">GLC-Class</a> are eligible for low finance rates and payment waivers.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile in Japan, <a href="https://www.motor1.com/acura/">Acura</a> will dish up $9,200 in lease incentives for the 2020 <a href="https://www.motor1.com/acura/tlx/">TLX </a>and $5,000 in dealer cash on select models. <a href="https://www.motor1.com/lexus/">Lexus</a> isn’t throwing a bunch of cash on the table, but the company will finance every 2019 model at zero percent for five years. Jumping to the U.K., <a href="https://www.motor1.com/jaguar/">Jaguar</a> is apparently <i>desperate</i> to move its<a href="https://www.motor1.com/jaguar/xf/"> XF</a> sedan because $13,000 in purchase incentives or $14,550 in lease incentives are available. The base model Jaguar <a href="https://www.motor1.com/jaguar/f-type/">F-Type</a> also gets its lease rate cut to $499 per month, depending on down payment, term, and mileage of course.</p>

      <p>As for America, right now the primary luxury deal comes from<a href="https://www.motor1.com/buick/"> Buick</a>. Well-equipped 2019 <a href="https://www.motor1.com/buick/enclave/">Enclave </a>models can see discounts top $11,000. 2019 <a href="https://www.motor1.com/buick/encore/">Encore</a> buyers can choose between zero-percent financing for six years or 22 percent off the sticker price.</p>
      <p>Since we’re still a couple of weeks out from the busiest shopping day of the year, more automaker discounts are certainly possible.</p>
