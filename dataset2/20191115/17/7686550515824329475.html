      <h2>Wendy Rowlands, the former head of Ysgol Swyn-y-Don, has been struck of the teaching register</h2>

      <p>A primary school headteacher acted dishonestly in making cheques out to herself for £6,500 being in charge of the school’s playgroup, a tribunal has ruled.</p>
      <p>The fitness to practise committee of the Education Workforce Council also found that Wendy Rowlands was dishonest in the way she tried to withhold financial records from council auditors investing the school’s affairs.</p>
      <p>Miss Rowlands was head of Penmaenrhos School from 2005 until 2015, when she took over as head of the new school Ysgol Swn-y-Don in Old Colwyn. She was sacked, however, in 2018, when an audit revealed several failings in her financial management .</p>
      <p>She has not attended this week’s hearing in Ewloe but admitted almost all the allegations against her.</p>
      <p>They included failing to close the accounts of Penmaenrhos and Tanymarian schools after they had merged, failing to open a new account for Ysgol Swn-y-Mor which meant that cheques worth £1,800 could not be paid in and failing to ensure that the schools accounts were audited.</p>
      <p>The committee also heard that she had used the school fund – money raised by parents and pupils – to pay for staff Christmas parties, a morale-boosting trip to Chester for staff, and alcohol for staff parties .</p>
      <p>The first party, in December, 2012, was authorised by the chair of the governors, Cllr Brian Cossey, as a reward for their hard work, but he told the hearing that he would not have approved the other expenditure.</p>
      <p>Miss Rowlands, who is understood to be now working as a supply teacher, said in a statement read at the hearing that she was ashamed to have used the fund for the benefit the staff and not the children.</p>
      <p>The allegation which she denied related to her involvement with the playgroup, which she claimed was a separate entity to the school.</p>
      <p>Between June, 2015, and July, 2017, she received £6,500 for her work but there was no authorisation for such payments.</p>
      <p>She claimed that she paid herself “about £15 an hour” but committee chairman Robert Newsome said that was “implausible” as it would have meant her working 400 hours at a time when she had other duties.</p>
      <p>In upholding most of the allegations against her, the committee found she had shown a lack of integrity amounting to “unacceptable professional conduct”.</p>
      <p>Miss Rowlands explained that she had failed to carry out some of the tasks because she was so busy with the opening of the new school and the financial matters “were not at the top of her list of priorities”.</p>
      <p>She said that for a while she was acting as clerk of works for the new building and also faced some animosity from parents over her appointment.</p>
      <p>The tribunal struck off Rowlands from the teaching register.</p>
