      <h1>Inside Britain's 'smartest boat' with robot vacuum cleaner and voice-activated kettle</h1>
      <h2>The boat was created by Argos and Google and also features a Nest Hub Max to check on the vessels when not onboard while you can answer the door from your mobile phone</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:03:26+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:03</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Wilkes, Astrid Hall, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>Designers have created Britain's 'smartest' boat with tech innovations such as a voice-activated smart kettle, self-dimming lights, robot vacuum cleaner and a video doorbell.</p>
      <p>Seafarers can take a break and enjoy a warming cup of tea without even flicking a switch by requesting a cuppa through voice activation.</p>
      <p>Crew members can alter the ambience on-demand through lamps and lighting, as well as keep in touch with family members or check in on the vessel when not onboard with a Nest Hub Max.</p>
      <p>The tight ship is kept spick and span with a robotic vacuum which clears away any dust and dirt from the deck, while on-board entertainment comes in the form of TV streaming.</p>
      <p>And to keep entry secure to the craft, a video doorbell has been fitted so you can answer the door from your mobile phone and see who is trying to climb aboard.</p>

      <p>The floating home includes a Nest Mini which allows users to activate the various smart gadgets by simply using their voice.</p>
      <p>The boat, which was created by Argos and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/google">Google</a> , comes after research found more than half of Brits aren't using their smart tech to its full potential.</p>

      <p>Researchers polling 2,000 adults who own smart devices - from speakers to thermostats - found despite not maximising its use, 54 per cent agreed their tech improves their productivity.</p>
      <p>A quarter would be 'lost' without it, and 22 per cent even went as far to say their smart home device helps them maintain their health and happiness.</p>

      <p>In fact, people are so devoted to their smart gadgets, three in 10 will take them away on a staycation in the UK, with nearly a quarter packing up their smart devices and taking them abroad.</p>
      <p>One in five even take it to work with them so they are never too far from their beloved contraptions.</p>

      <p>The research, conducted via OnePoll, also found 48 per cent have used a smart device to settle an argument by firing questions at it during a debate.</p>
      <p>Finding out the meaning of a word, which country a city is located or the year a movie came out are among the disputes modern technology has resolved.</p>
      <p>It also emerged owners of smart tech each have two gadgets on average, and are willing to shell out Â£147 a time on a new gizmo.</p>

      <p>Smart speaker aficionados say the most useful functions of their smart home devices are playing music (52 per cent), knowing the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> forecast (44 per cent) and telling the time (35 per cent).</p>
      <p>Chirag Shah, smart home buyer at Argos, said: "Smart home devices have so many functions that consumers just don't realise exist.</p>
      <p>"Our research even shows that a connected smart home has the potential to save people nine hours of time a week.</p>
      <p>"That's why we've created Britain's Smartest Boat with Google, to showcase all the amazing things that smart home devices can do and bring them to life in a fun way for our customers."</p>
