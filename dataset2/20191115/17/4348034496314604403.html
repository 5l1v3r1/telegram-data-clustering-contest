      <p>Yesterday (November 14), Royce 5’9 released a powder keg of bars in the song “Black Savage.” Produced by the decorated MC, the song was posted on social accounts by the NFL, reportedly <a href="https://ambrosiaforheads.com/2019/11/royce-5-9-nfl-verse-black-audio/">tied into JAY-Z’s Inspire Change initiative with the league</a>. However, the song is not about football. Instead, the track—which comes at a time Royce has suggested a followup to <a href="https://ambrosiaforheads.com/2018/12/best-hip-hop-rap-albums-2018/">2018’s highly-acclaimed</a> <a href="https://ambrosiaforheads.com/2018/05/royce-59-book-of-ryan-album-breakdown-editorial/"><i>The Book Of Ryan</i></a>—is about redefining what it means to be labeled “a Black savage.” A firing squad of elite MCs, including T.I. and CyHi The Prynce join Nickel Nine to flip a disparaging term on its head and show what excellence really looks like.</p>
      <p>The new video, featuring all of the MCs, as well as singer White Gold on the hook, and veteran Atlanta, Georgia MC providing a bridge, opens with a quote. “<i>You have to decide who you are and force the world to deal with you, not the idea of you,</i>” attributed to author James Baldwin. With bold bars, these artists make a soulful song that demonstrates how savagery can be a virtue. It takes place in a stylish nighttime mansion party that celebrates the good life and heritage at once. Fellow Slaughterhouse co-founder Kxng Crooked makes a cameo in the visual.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Royce opens with an example of why he continues to reach new ground with his songwriting at the same time he begins a production career.“<i>I don’t believe in your white Jesus and Last Supper’s / I place value on brothers who never had justice / I am a Black savage / Ali and Foreman in Zaire, fighting for Black magic / Rifles and flag jackets / Mama was suicidal, Papa had bad habits / Product of true survival / Rocker, like Black Sabbath / Hoppin’ up out the Chevy / Pac, Biggie, and Machiavelli / O.G., like Nas and Reggie / Culture like ‘Ox’ in </i>Belly<i> / Vulgar like Akinyele / Focused like Dr. Sebi / We did it your way, but now the culture is boppin’ to our Sinatra medley / I’m limitless energy / They gimmicks and imagery / Kendrick, Cole, and the Kennedy’s / Lyrical Holy Trinity / General of the city / They into promoting silly beef / Keepin’ it Willie D / Weezy on the ‘A Milli’ beat / Dreamchaser facing the enemy like my ni**a Meek / Tyler Perry writing my winning speech like it’s Emmy week / Heart of gold, never sold my soul, gun weighs a ton / Hov tellin’ Lori Harvey no at the Roc Nation</i> <i>brunch</i>,” he raps.</p>

      <p>CyHi opens the song with a melodic nod to Kurtis Blow and Lauryn Hill. “<i>If I ruled the world / I would return all the gold that was stole’ / We upholster the nose on the Sphinx, it’s a world war / They try’na take the soul outta Soul / Ni**as say I sold out; I never sold out a show,</i>” he begins, pointing out some historical savagery. “<i>I don’t hang with pawns / I’m Genghis Khan,</i>” he charges a few bars later. CyHi’s Atlanta neighbor T.I. closes out the song, addressing the people who judge him for his past. “<i>You could never be me / Knew who I was before I got out the trap to sell the CD / I been shoulder-to-shoulder with gangstas facing LAPD / Felony after felony, still they be yellin’ me free / Now, my philosophy / Is no possession or apostrophe / ‘Cause ain’t no use bein’ in prison; you ain’t gotta be / Ironically, we dodge a crazy cracker with hammers / Just how they used to dodge a ni**a with braids and bandana / Man, it been more mass-killin’s than its been days in the year / Wonder if fighting for it worth it as much as leaving it here.</i>” The former felon-turned-mogul admits the mistakes of his past without being shy about condemning the violence permeating society, and reminding his listeners where it seems to come from.</p>
