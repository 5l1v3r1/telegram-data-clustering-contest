      <p>The actress has said that she will continue to join in on the event dubbed Fire Drill Fridays until she has to get back to filming the Netflix series in January. It also means she needs to avoid being arrested before her Nov. 27 court date, because the accumulation of her first four arrests could mean she will be held up to 30 days.</p>
