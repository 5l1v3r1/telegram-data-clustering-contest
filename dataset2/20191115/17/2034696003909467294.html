      </p>
      <p>The iconic artwork for <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/the-beatles">The Beatles</a>‘ ‘Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band’ album cover has been updated for the 21st century, with a variety of modern musicians, celebrities and pop culture figures included on the newly designed piece.</p>
      <p>The artwork was designed by German artist <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/trippiesteff?">TrippieSteff</a> as part of a remake of several classic album covers, including <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/blondie">Blondie</a>’s ‘Parallel Lines’ and <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/nirvana">Nirvana</a>’s ‘Nevermind’, by a team of graphic designers and artists.</p>
      <p>The new artwork, which features <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/taylor-swift">Taylor Swift</a>, <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/kanye-west">Kanye West</a>, <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/drake">Drake</a> and <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/lil-nas-x">Lil Nas X</a> in place of the original Fab Four at the centre, depicts a range of contemporary figures including Elon Musk, Kylie Jenner, Bernie Sanders and BoJack Horseman. See the new design below.</p>

      <p>TrippieSteff reimagines The Beatles’ iconic album artwork</p>
      <p>“The original cover was a blend of high and low cultural figures that depicted the zeitgeist mindset of the late 60s,” TrippieSteff explained. “It was also a group of influential figures that were ‘heroes’ to The Beatles. With a desire to keep the same theme, I chose to feature the most iconic and influential figures of the past decade.</p>
      <p>“These are people that have been controversial figures in music, politics, television, human rights and more. By putting them together in the same image, I wanted to show that they are all equally important.” See the full list of names featured below.</p>
