      <p><i>One-Punch Man: A Hero Nobody Knows </i>is actually, factually coming to video game consoles, folks. It launches Feb. 28, 2020.</p>
      <p>Still, since its announcement <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/6/25/18756260/one-punch-man-fighting-game-ps4-xbox-one-pc">back in June</a>, questions have abounded how <i>One-Punch Man: A Hero Nobody Knows</i> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/9/11/20860315/one-punch-man-fighting-game-saitama-balance">can be balanced as a fighting game</a> (with multiplayer, even) yet remain true to the absurdist lore of an anime whose protagonist is quite bored of dispatching foes with one punch.</p>
      <p>The answer lies within its three-fighter structure, where players may choose Saitama (One-Punch Man) for their team if they wish, but he may show up late to the brawl — if at all. And now there’s another hedge: Dream Saitama.</p>
      <p>In his pajama’d state (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7WgNRmtWrw">as seen in <i>One-Punch Man</i>’s first episode</a>, where he dukes it out with Subterranean King) One-Punch Man is just a regular fighter. So you can add Saitama to your fighting party and brawl with a cohort of three as normal — he just lacks his namesake one-hit kill ability.</p>
      <p>Spike Chunsoft has other tricks up its sleeve to make <i>One-Punch Man </i>competitive. King, aka the guy who takes credit for Saitama’s feats of strength, will sometimes appear (as an NPC) and freeze the fighters, for example. There’s also a big roster of characters other than One-Punch Man to choose from, including new reveals Metal Knight, Stinger, and Melzargard.</p>
      <p>Hoo boy. This looks even more bonkers than Spike Chunsoft’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/2/14/18225243/jump-force-review-shonen-jump-characters">last opus, <i>Jump Force</i></a>, but I am here for it. <i>One-Punch Man: A Hero Nobody Knows </i>will be available for <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FOne-Punch-Man-A-Hero-Nobody-Knows-PlayStation-4-Bandai-Namco-722674121880%2F202655119&amp;subid1=polygon">PlayStation 4</a>, Windows PC, and <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FOne-Punch-Man-A-Hero-Nobody-Knows-Xbox-One-Bandai-Namco-722674221221%2F782727288&amp;subid1=polygon">Xbox One</a>.</p>
