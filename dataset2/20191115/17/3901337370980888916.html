      <p>Reports in Spain and France in recent weeks have suggested that Los Blancos are readying a big-money move for the 20-year-old, but there now seems to be a new development.</p>
      <p>According to <i>ESPN</i>, to counter the threat of the 13-time UEFA Champions League winners, PSG have offered the striker a new contract in France.</p>
      <p>The Ligue 1 giants are believed to have no intentions of letting the forward leave next season, which is when Real were said to be hoping to lure him to Spain.</p>

      <p>It has also been claimed that Mbappe has given the French champions his word that he will not look to leave ahead of the 2020/21 season, although it remains to be seen whether or not he accepts the club's new deal for him.</p>
      <p>The new contract would see the forward earn nearly as much as Neymar, whose future in France is still unclear amid constant speculation that he could return to FC Barcelona.</p>
