      <p>The Supreme Court on Friday stayed the Allahabad High Court order on Chinmayanand’s request for a certified copy of a Shahjahanpur woman law student’s statement made against the BJP leader before a magistrate.</p>
      <p>On November 7, the High Court had asked the trial court to provide the former Union Minister a copy of the statement.</p>
      <p>She has challenged the High Court order in the Supreme Court.</p>
      <p>On Friday, a Supreme Court Bench sought a response from the U.P. government on the woman’s plea. “Issue notice, returnable on December 9,” the Bench said, adding, “Pending further consideration, the operation of the order impugned herein shall remain stayed”.</p>
