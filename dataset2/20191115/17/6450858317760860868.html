      <h1>The best TV shows on Disney Plus in November 2019</h1>
      <h2>There's a whole host of shows on Disney Plus, but which are the best ones to check out? We've picked out some of our favourites</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:19:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:19</time> by <a rel="author">Hannah Cowton</a></address>
      <p>Disney Plus has finally dawned, and with it comes a whole host of televised content - both old and fresh.</p>
      <p>We’ve taken a magnifying glass to all the programmes on Disney+, and selected some of the best ones available to give you a new show to binge. If you’d prefer a one-off film, then take a look at our picks of <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/feature/entertainment/best-movies-disney-plus-3777777/">the best movies on Disney+</a>. Or if you're not in the states, then see <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/how-to/entertainment/watch-disney-plus-uk-3777628/">how to watch Disney+ from the UK</a>. </p>

        <h3>The Mandalorian</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>RRP:</b>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Let’s be honest - this is what most people have come to Disney+ for in the first place. The Mandalorian is a live-action Star Wars spin-off by Jon Favreau, and is currently releasing episodes on a weekly basis. If you’d like to see a Western spin of the biggest space franchise out there, then this is one to watch.</p>
        <anchor name="toc-3777932-2">
          <h3>The Simpsons</h3>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/slideshow/3777932/the_simpsons_thumb800.jpg"/>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>RRP:</b>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Netflix has friends, Amazon Prime as The Office, and Disney+ has The Simpsons. We strongly suspect that once The Mandalorian hype dies down, this’ll be the most popular thing on the platform - and with 30 seasons worth of comedy to binge, there’s no chance you’ll run out of episodes anytime soon.</p>
          <anchor name="toc-3777932-3">
            <h3>Lizzie McGuire</h3>
            <figure>
              <img src="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/slideshow/3777932/lizzie_mcguire_thumb800.jpg"/>

                <b>RRP:</b>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>You may have already heard the news about Lizzie McGuire returning next year to Disney+, so why not get prepared by revisiting (or exploring) the OG series? Follow thirteen year old Lizzie (AKA Hilary Duff) as she navigates the rollercoaster that is teenagehood with her best friends, Miranda and Gordo.</p>

              <h3>Star Wars: The Clone Wars</h3>
              <figure>
                <img src="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/slideshow/3777932/star_wars_the_clone_wars_thumb800.jpg"/>
              </figure>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>RRP:</b>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Sadly Genndy Tartakovsky’s phenomenal 2D Clone Wars series is nowhere to be found on Disney+, but the CGI follow-up is still well worth a watch - as is the follow-up Star Wars Rebels. Over six seasons the show dug deep into the galaxy’s grandest conflict, and almost makes up for the prequels on its own. Plus, February 2020 will bring with it a seventh and final season to give the story the finale it deserves.</p>

                <h3>The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody</h3>
                <figure>
                  <img src="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/slideshow/3777932/suite-life-zack-cody_thumb800.jpg"/>
                </figure>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <b>RRP:</b>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Yet another Disney Channel classic with just the right amount of noughties cringe to keep you laughing. Suite Life follows twin brothers Zack and Cody who get into all kinds of trouble at the very posh Tipton Hotel in Boston, after their mum lands a gig as the lounge singer of the hotel.</p>

                  <h3>Recess</h3>
                  <figure>
                    <img src="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/slideshow/3777932/recess_thumb800.jpg"/>
                  </figure>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <b>RRP:</b>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Here’s a throwback if you’ve ever known one. Recess features a bunch of six misfits - Vince, Spinelli, Mikey, T.J., Gretchen, and Gus - as they navigate their short adventures during the breaks in Third Street Elementary School, Arkansas. Each character is a complete US school stereotype, but that doesn't spoil what is a classic cartoon. </p>

                    <h3>X-Men</h3>
                    <figure>
                      <img src="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/slideshow/3777932/x-men_thumb800.jpg"/>
                    </figure>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <b>RRP:</b>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Anyone who’s ever seen Fox’s ‘90s X-Men series is already humming the theme tune to themselves while reading this - it’s impossible not to. Probably the best thing to come out of the Disney/Fox merger is this - and the similar Spider-Man series - making it onto the Disney streaming service, thanks to its potent mix of golden era X-Men costumes, high melodrama, and totally rad guitar riffs.</p>

                      <h3>The World According to Jeff Goldblum</h3>
                      <figure>
                        <img src="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/slideshow/3777932/the_world_according_to_jeff_goldblum_thumb800.jpeg"/>
                      </figure>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          <b>RRP:</b>
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>Ever wanted to see Jeff Goldblum do deep dives on niche subjects, whilst reacting in a very ‘Jeff Goldblum’ way? This is the perfect one for you. Though many may pen this as a documentary, the educational aspects are fleeting in comparison to some of the hilarious opinions and reactions of the host. All in all, a fun Sunday afternoon watch.</p>

                        <h3>Agent Carter</h3>
                        <figure>
                          <img src="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/slideshow/3777932/peggy_carter_thumb800.jpg"/>
                        </figure>
                        <ul>
                          <li>
                            <b>RRP:</b>
                          </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Hayley Atwell’s Peggy Carter was always the best part of the first Captain America movie (sorry Chris, America’s ass earned its keep in the sequels) so it was a treat when she got her own show. This short-but-sweet ‘50s-set series only ran for 18 episodes over two seasons, but a host of deep-cut Marvel references and James D’Arcy’s Edwin Jarvis make this one of the MCU’s best small-screen outings yet.</p>

                          <h3>Gargoyles</h3>
                          <figure>
                            <img src="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/slideshow/3777932/gargoyles_thumb800.jpg"/>
                          </figure>
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              <b>RRP:</b>
                            </li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>Disney had a bit of a golden age of TV animation in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s with the likes of Duck Tales and Darkwing Duck, but our favourite of the era has to be Gargoyles. This unexpectedly moody, gothic series feels like a Disney take on the same decade’s Batman series, boosted by a voice cast that’s a) great, and b) basically a giant Star Trek reunion for some reason.</p>
