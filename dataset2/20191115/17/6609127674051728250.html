      <p>A SPS spokesperson said: "Steven Alexander Dickie, 24, a prisoner at HMP Perth has died.</p>
      <p>"He was convicted at Edinburgh Court on 30 May 2019.</p>
      <p>"Police Scotland have been advised and the matter reported to the Procurator Fiscal.</p>
      <p>"A Fatal Accident Inquiry will be held in due course."</p>
      <p>Dickie's death came as Tamsin Glass and Callum Davidson appealed their sentences for culpable homicide and murder.</p>

      <p>Both had their appeals rejected.</p>
      <p>Donaldson's sister Lori said: "We're glad the appeal was rejected. We were in agreement with the sentence from the beginning.</p>
      <p>"It was horrible seeing them again, it was horrible having to go through it again.</p>
      <p>"We are just glad it is done and we got the outcome that we wanted."</p>

      <p>Earlier this year Dickie was given a life sentence for murdering oil worker Mr Donaldson.</p>
      <p>Donaldson's body was discovered in the car park at Kinnordy Nature Reserve near Kirriemuir, Angus, in the early hours of June 7 last year.</p>
      <p>Detectives said the 27-year-old from Arbroath had been the victim of a "sustained and brutal attack".</p>
      <p>Dickie and Davidson were convicted in May of murdering the offshore worker following a trial at the High Court in Edinburgh.</p>
      <p>The pair, both 24, were jailed for life when they returned to the court.</p>
      <p>Glass, 20, who was an ex-girlfriend of Donaldson was told she would be caged for 10 years after being convicted of culpable homicide.</p>

      <p>The trio planned to launch an attack at the quiet park before driving Steven to the Kinnordy Nature Reserve where they killed him.</p>
      <p>Graphic evidence from a forensic pathologist detailed the extent of the horror injuries inflicted on Donaldson - which included severing his spinal cord in two places.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors believe the pair used an axe or machete type weapon to inflict the killer blows but these weapons were never recovered.</p>
      <p>After killing him the pair then set fire to his car in an effort to hide any evidence.</p>
      <p>The jury spent more than nine hours in their deliberations.</p>
      <p>Eventually they found both Davidson and Dickie guilty of murder.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Glass was found guilty of culpable homicide.</p>
