      <p><span dir="auto">President Trump railed against the guilty verdict for Roger Stone Friday, after a jury convicted the President’s longtime associate on all the counts against him. Stone was found guilty of </span>obstruction, five counts of false statements and witness tampering.</p>
      <p>Minutes after news broke of the verdict in Stone’s trial, Trump took to Twitter to weigh in on what he called a “double standard.” Trump’s criticism of the verdict could be seen as a step toward a potential pardon for Stone.</p>

      <p>Stone was indicted in January by the Washington, D.C. grand jury that special counsel Robert Mueller empaneled for the Russia probe that investigated meddling in the 2016 election.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors in Stone’s trial — which lasted a little more than a week, with the jury speding less than two days deliberating — <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/prosecutors-outline-key-conversations-in-roger-stone-wikileaks-timeline">put forward emails and texts</a> that they argued is evidence for how Stone lied to the House Intelligence Committee about having Wikileaks-related communications that he didn’t turn over to Congress.</p>
