      <p>After 2 very successful release's for 001 and 002, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/vantagerecordsuk">Vantage Records</a> are back with their 3rd release. This one might actually be my favorite so far. The label's head honcho, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/lxone">LX One</a> has enlisted the talents of French producer, <a href="https://www.magneticmag.com/tag/argo/">Argo</a>. He's put together a 4 track instrumental EP thats absolutely stacked full of weight. We were given the opportunity to premiere the track "Don't Sleep," which you can listen to below.</p>

      <p>From the moment the intro chimes into motion, you instantly know which artist this production belongs too. His sound is always so unique, a trait he has perfected over the past few years. "Don't Sleep" is a glitchy, up-beat instrumental, smothered in hip-hop textures partnered with wonky bass lines. Its a minimal masterpiece and easily my favorite from the EP. </p>
      <p>The entire release is available on November 22 via all normal online retailers. Out to Argo and the Vantage Records family. </p>
