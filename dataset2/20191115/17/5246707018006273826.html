      <p>As an officially licensed game – complete with character likenesses in Reigns’ angular portrait format and Ramin Djawadi's instantly recognisable score – <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/reigns_game_of_thrones">Reigns: Game of Thrones</a></b> is about as close as you’ll come to living the day-to-day life of a Westeros monarch, short of visiting the Seven Kingdoms for real. By bringing in key characters and events from the books and show, you’re given enough authenticity that exploring storylines only ever teased in the source material (such as seeing Jamie on the throne or a more compassionate version of Cersei) feel just as meaningful.</p>
      <p>The original <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/reigns_kings_and_queens">Reigns: Kings &amp; Queens</a></b> is also on offer and worth a look.</p>

      <p>While <b>Street Fighter</b> and <b>King of Fighters</b> continue to dominate the one-on-one combat genre, <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/neogeo/garou_mark_of_the_wolves"><b>Garou: Mark of the Wolves</b></a> will be remembered as an undisputed high-point for this style of game. This is the work of a company at the height of its powers, with an intimate understanding of hardware which was - by 1999 - almost a decade old. The controls are tight, the cast is varied and appealing (if a little small) and the visuals rank as some of the best examples of hand-drawn artwork ever seen in a video game. It therefore goes without saying that Garou is an <i>essential</i> purchase for each and every Switch owner, even if you don't consider yourself to be a fan of the genre. If you're unsure exactly <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/feature_just_who_the_heck_is_terry_bogard_smash_bros_ultimates_new_dlc_fighter">who Terry is</a>, this is a fine way to find out.</p>
      <p>Various other Neo Geo fighters are on offer, too, so you're spoiled for choice.</p>

      <p><b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu-eshop/gunman_clive_hd_collection">Gunman Clive HD Collection</a></b> is an absolute no-brainer. For the low price of entry, you are getting HD versions of not one, but <i>two</i> of the most impeccably-crafted action platformers of the last decade. They may be over a bit too soon and they may not always have the most fair level designs, but there's more than enough replayability here to cancel out both of these problems. It's hardly an expensive game without the discount, but every little helps - do yourself a favor and go download this game immediately.</p>

      </p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/robonauts">Robonauts</a></b> reworks the conventions of a classic arcade shooter by pairing the timeless genre with basic platform game action. The pick up and play nature also remains intact. With two difficulties and some challenging objectives, this game is no pushover. Unfortunately, one shortcoming of arcade shooters is often the repetition that comes with eliminating wave after wave of enemies, and Robonauts is not exempt from this. Still, it is a well-crafted Nintendo Switch eShop game that could provide fun play sessions in-between bigger releases, and even a new co-op experience for family and friends.</p>
