      <h1>'In a heartbeat' - Fans react to shock Aston Villa speculation</h1>
      <h2>Aston Villa latest news includes Hearts fans enjoying John Terry being linked with manager's job</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:51:37+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:51</time> by <a rel="author">Shane Ireland, https://www.facebook.com/ShaneIrelandJournalist</a></address>
      <p>Hearts fans have given the green-light to a potential swoop for John Terry after the Aston Villa assistant was linked with the manager’s job.</p>
      <p>The Scottish Premiership side are on the hunt for a new boss after sacking former Scotland chief Craig Levein last month.</p>
      <p>And <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/john-terry">Terry</a> is being suggested as a possible successor after rising up the betting.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-coach-john-terry-17261482">The former Chelsea captain was fifth favourite at 11/1 this morning,</a> but is now the 7/1 third favourite to take charge with SkyBet.</p>

      <p>Terry, who captained <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> to the Championship play-off final in 2017/18, returned to the club as an assistant head coach to <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/dean-smith">Dean Smith</a> last October.</p>
      <p>"He's got better and better if I'm honest," said Smith. "When he first came in he looked at me and Richard (O'Kelly) for a lot of advice, where as now he will just go out and take players aside.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"He does video work with them as well as bits on the training ground. He's become an excellent coach. He focuses more on the defensive side of it and Richard will focus on the forward play. I have more of a holistic view of all of it.</p>
      <p>"He's enjoying what he's doing at the football club. He keeps telling me that he's enjoying learning from us so I've got to take his word for that."</p>

      <p>Steve Cotterill, the former Birmingham City boss, is the current favourite to land the job but Hearts fans are keen on the idea of Terry being appointed at Tynecastle Park.</p>
      <p>One said: "I would take John Terry in a heartbeat!"</p>
      <p>"John Terry as Hearts manager?" said another. "I'm already looking forward to him wearing a full Hearts Kit and trying to lift the trophy when we win the Scottish."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>A third added: "John Terry on the Hampden turf in a full Hearts kit when we win the Scottish in May."</p>
      <p>"John Terry," said another supporter. "Captain Leader Legend."</p>
      <p>"If Hearts pull off John Terry I’ll do a full training session in just my boxers and socks," joked a fifth.</p>
