      <h1>NTSB report: Civilian aviation deaths in U.S. increased in 2018</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:09:24+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:09</time> by <a rel="author">Nicholas Sakelaris</a></address>
      <p>Nov. 15 (UPI) -- The number of persons killed last year in plane crashes in the United States climbed by nearly 15 percent, the nation's top civil aviation investigators say in a new report.</p>
      <p>The National Transportation Safety Board said in the <a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/news/press-releases/Pages/NR20191114.aspx">compilation report</a> that 393 people died in crashes in 2018 -- an increase of 13 percent over 2017. The statistics were posted Thursday.</p>
      <p>The majority of the deaths, 381, died in general aviation or private aircraft crashes, the NTSB said. That's an increase of 50 over 2017.</p>
      <p>The year 2018 also saw the first death aboard a commercial civilian airliner in 10 years -- Jennifer Riordan, who was partly pulled out of a window when a Southwest Airlines flight depressurized in flight. Investigators later found that an engine cowling broke loose and punctured the passenger cabin.</p>
      <p>There were 12 deaths last year on on-demand flights, or those involving air taxis, charters, air tours and medical services.</p>
      <p>"It is disappointing to see the fatal general aviation accident rate increase after two years with the rate below 1.0 per 100,000 flight hours," said NTSB Chairman Robert L. Sumwalt. "[Aviation] communities need to renew their emphasis on building and sustaining a safety culture."</p>
      <p>The report did not specify possible reasons for the increase in aviation deaths.</p>
