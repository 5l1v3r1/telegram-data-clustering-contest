      <p>“I’m not joking, every single year about every three months or so someone else gives us another offer and we keep saying no,” she responded. “It keeps coming ’round. Right now there’s another offer on the table and I think this is the closest we’ve ever come to accepting one. But whether that will happen or not, I don’t know.”</p>
