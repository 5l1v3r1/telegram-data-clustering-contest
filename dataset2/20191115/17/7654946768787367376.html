      <p>A 9-year-old child prodigy from Belgium is more than a decade ahead of his peers as he’s set to graduate from college next month, according to a new report.</p>
      <p>Laurent Simons, who is studying electrical engineering at Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands, is set to finish his degree by December, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/14/europe/university-graduate-child-genius-scli-intl/index.html">CNN reported</a>.</p>
      <p>The young genius will then go for his PhD in electrical engineering, while also working for a degree in medicine.</p>
      <p>Prestigious universities around the world have already reached out to recruit Laurent, but his parents, Lydia and Alexander Simons, wouldn’t say where the youngster plans to pursue his next degree.</p>
      <p>Laurent’s grandparents were the first to recognize he had a gift, his parents told CNN.</p>
      <p>“They noticed something very special about Laurent,” Lydia said.</p>
      <p>Then his teachers confirmed he was no ordinary student.</p>
      <p>“They told us he is like a sponge,” Alexander told CNN. “The absorption of information is no problem for Laurent. I think the focus will be on research and applying the knowledge to discover new things.”</p>
      <p>Laurent comes from a family of doctors — but his parents are still grappling to explain how he absorbs knowledge so quickly.</p>

      <p>“I ate a lot of fish during the pregnancy,” Lydia joked.</p>
      <p>Sjoerd Hulshof, education director for the electrical engineering bachelor’s program at the university, told CNN that Laurent is “simply extraordinary.”</p>
      <p>“Laurent is the fastest student we have ever had here,” he said. “Not only is he hyper intelligent but also a very sympathetic boy.”</p>
      <p>The university has allowed Laurent to complete his studies faster than others — which Hulshof said is “not unusual.”</p>
      <p>“Special students that have good reasons for doing so can arrange an adjusted schedule,” he told the network. “In much the same way we help students who participate in top sport.”</p>
      <p>As the prodigy’s education and career progress, Laurent already has an ultimate goal: to develop artificial organs.</p>
      <p>But he’s also an ordinary kid who enjoys playing with his dog, Sammy, and fiddling with his cellphone.</p>
      <p>Before he goes for an advanced degree, he plans to vacation in Japan.</p>
      <p>“We don’t want him to get too serious,” his father said. “He does whatever he likes. We need to find a balance between being a child and his talents.”</p>
