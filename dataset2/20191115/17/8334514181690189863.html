      <p>ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Roche is paying up to $1.4 billion to buy U.S. biotech company Promedior, whose main drug candidate against the lung disease idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is set to begin late-stage trials, Promedior said on Friday.</p>
      <p>The deal includes a payment of $390 million, plus the potential for $1 billion more if conditions are met. Promediorâ€™s lead asset PRM-151 is being studied in IPF where the firm said it helped improve lung function, on top of current therapies.</p>
      <p>Roche already has an IPF medicine, Esbriet, with 2018 sales of just over $1 billion.</p>
