      <h1>Rockstar apologises for rocky Red Dead Redemption 2 PC launch</h1>

        <b>Following the notoriously rocky launch of Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC, Rockstar has issued an official statement to apologise for the problems and say it’s working on a fix.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a four part statement <a href="https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/1194669204802281476/photo/1">issued on Twitter</a>, Rockstar acknowledges that Red Dead Redemption 2’s PC launch has been plagued by performance issues.</p>
      <p>The company also says that a “number of these issues” have already been identified and resolved by deploying fixes to both the Rockstar Games Launcher and the game itself.</p>

      <p>However, some PC players are still experiencing problems with the game, and Rockstar believes that the cause is “unforeseen issues related to specific combinations of NVIDIA graphics drivers, NVIDIA GPU cards, and certain CPUs.”</p>
      <p>As such, an update to the game is now rolling out to address Red Dead Redemption 2’s stuttering issue alongside other fixes. Rockstar also says it’s working with NVIDIA to resolve the issue in a future update, which may take “up to a few days” for proper testing.</p>
      <p>It’s slightly ironic that NVIDIA’s GPUs are causing problems, especially given that NVIDIA <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/nvidia-red-dead-redemption-2-ideal-gpus/">previously released a list of which of its GPUs would make for the most ideal Red Dead Redemption 2 experience</a>.</p>
      <p>Along with an apology, Rockstar is also issuing a complimentary care package for all Red Dead Redemption 2 PC players who play the game “this week and through to the holiday season.” The care package consists of the Prieto Poncho and an assortment of provisions and ammo. More details regarding the care package will be available at a later date.</p>
