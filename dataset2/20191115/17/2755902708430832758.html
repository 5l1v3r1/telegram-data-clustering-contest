      <h1>WATCH: “RBZ” Addresses Allegations That It Is Supplying Black Market In “Exclusive Conference”</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:05:01+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:05</time> by <a rel="author">Timothy Ndoro</a></address>
      <p>Following the release of the new currency this past week, Zimbabweans were left fuming after sealed bricks of the new brand new notes flooded the black market barely hours after being released. Even worse, images circulated on social media showing illegal money changers bragging with the cash.</p>
      <p>After much social media outrage, the government responded by saying that the new notes had been laundered. The Reserve Bank (RBZ) then shifted the blame to two banks, Ecobank and CBZ saying they were the culprits. The two are alleged to have allowed customers to withdraw $15 000 in new notes and $44 120 in coins respectively.</p>
      <p>However, the RBZ’s explanation does not seem to have persuaded sceptical Zimbabweans who have suffered in the past from the central bank’s policies.</p>
      <p>As usual, the folks at Magamba Network and the inimitable King Kandoro did not disappoint as they made fun of the governor and the central bank’s efforts to explain the currency debacle.</p>
