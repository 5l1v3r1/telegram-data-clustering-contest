      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:32:24+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:32</time> by <a rel="author">ESPNcricinfo staff</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/player/277916.html">Ajinkya Rahane</a>, <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/newzealand/content/player/277912.html">Trent Boult</a> and <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/player/1081442.html">Mayank Markande</a> have all got a raise in the IPL by being traded to other franchises before the 2020 auction next month. Rahane earned an extra INR 1.25 crores as he was picked for INR 5.25 crores by his new franchise Delhi Capitals, compared to the INR 4 crores Rajasthan Royals had paid for him in the 2018 auction.</p>

      <p>Similarly, Boult earned an extra INR 1 crore in an all-cash deal, since Mumbai Indians paid INR 3.2 crores for him compared to Capitals' original outlay of INR 2.2 crores for him in 2018. Markande, the least experienced of the three, got the biggest raise among them, of INR 1.8 crores. His new franchise Royals paid INR 2 crores for him, after the double-trade from Mumbai, who paid INR 20 lakhs for him in 2018. Mumbai first traded him to Capitals, who then passed him on to Royals.</p>
      <p>There were a total of 11 trades this time before the upcoming auction. The most high-profile one, apart from Rahane's, was of R Ashwin, who led Kings XI during the last two seasons and moved to the Capitals, who paid his 2018 hammer price of INR 7.6 crore. As part of the exchange, Capitals traded Karnataka spinner J Suchith to Kings XI for just INR 20 lakhs.</p>
      <p>As part of the Rahane trade, the Royals got a pair of legspinners for a total of INR 5 crores: Rahul Tewatia (3 crores) and Markande (2 crores). During the trade, Markande also became the first player in the IPL to be traded twice between two seasons. He was in fact the first trade after Capitals bought him from defending champions Mumbai. In return, Mumbai bought West Indies allrounder Sherfane Rutherford (INR 2 crore in the 2018 auction) from Capitals.</p>
