      <h1>Sign Up To Test GitHub's New iOS And Android Apps</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lifehacker.com.au/author/brendan-hesse" target="_blank">Brendan Hesse</a></address>
      <p>Github is an excellent <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2019/05/fund-your-favourite-open-source-projects-using-githubs-new-sponsorship-program">resource for programmers of all levels</a> and serves as a great repository of readily available software and development tools. The website is a chore to use on anything other than a desktop, but that could soon change thanks to a new dedicated app that GitHub is asking you to help beta test.</p>
      <p>To get started, you can check out GitHub’s <a href="https://github.com/mobile">official beta sign up page</a>, or you can jump directly to your platform of choice—<a href="https://github.com/mobile/beta?platforms=ios"><b>iOS</b></a> or <a href="https://github.com/mobile/beta?platforms=android"><b>Android</b></a>—if you have <a href="https://github.com/join">an active GitHub account</a>. The iOS beta is currently live, and the Android beta is more of a wait list than an app you can grab right now.</p>
      <p>Obviously, your smartphone’s smaller screen means the mobile app experience will be limited compared to the desktop version of GitHub. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/13/github-launches-a-mobile-app-smarter-notifications-and-improved-code-search/">According to Tech Crunch</a>, the app lets you contribute to discussion threads, review code (though this is limited to only a few lines), and merge changes.</p>
      <p>While the iOS and Android apps should be the same as far as functionality goes, there are definitely differences between using the app on a phone versus a tablet. Thanks to the iPad’s larger screen, users will be able to view more content and review even more code within the app. It will also support a few of the GitHub website’s keyboard shortcuts if an external keyboard is attached. Otherwise, the limitations of the smartphone app also exist on iPad (and other tablets).</p>
