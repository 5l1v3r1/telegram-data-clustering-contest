      <h1>Lakers' Avery Bradley has hairline fracture in right leg</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:39:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:39</time> by <a rel="author">Dave McMenamin</a></address>
      <p>LOS ANGELES -- <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lal/los-angeles-lakers">Lakers</a> guard <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4240/avery-bradley">Avery Bradley</a> has a hairline fracture in his right leg and will be reevaluated in one to two weeks, the team announced Friday.</p>
      <p>Bradley injured his leg during a collision with <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/sa/san-antonio-spurs">San Antonio Spurs</a> guard <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3907497/dejounte-murray">Dejounte Murray</a> on Nov. 3. After missing one game -- the Lakers' comeback victory in <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/chi/chicago-bulls">Chicago</a> -- he returned to the lineup and played in L.A.'s past four games.</p>
      <p>The hairline fracture is on the fibular head of his right leg, which is a non-weight-bearing bone, according to the team. The injury was discovered after an MRI on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>Initial X-rays on the leg came back negative, but because the injury continued to bother Bradley, the team followed up with an MRI.</p>
      <p>"It's the same injury, and he's been playing through pretty significant pain," Lakers coach Frank Vogel said Friday. "They wanted to go through and give it another MRI to make sure there was nothing there, and they found something there. So it'll just be a couple weeks, hopefully."</p>
      <p>The Lakers' defense ranks third in the NBA for points allowed (100.9), and Vogel said Bradley was a big reason why.</p>
      <p>"He's been a tone setter for us on the defensive end," Vogel said. "... So he'll be missed."</p>
      <p>Vogel said <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2581018/kentavious-caldwell-pope">Kentavious Caldwell-Pope</a> (ankle) is available for Friday's game against the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/sac/sacramento-kings">Sacramento Kings</a>, but he wouldn't say if KCP would start in Bradley's place like he did in Chicago. <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3026/rajon-rondo">Rajon Rondo</a> is also available but is on a 20-minute restriction.</p>
      <p>"Next man up. That's what our depth is all about," <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1966/lebron-james">LeBron James</a> said Friday. "Obviously it's a tough blow for us, especially early in the season with the way Avery has been playing and setting the tone defensively. I've been on that side of the floor. But it's next man up all the way down until he comes back."</p>
      <p>Bradley signed a two-year, $9.7 million deal with Los Angeles in the offseason. In 10 games with the Lakers, all of them starts, he is averaging 9.6 points on 48.8% shooting, 3.2 rebounds, 1.8 assists and 1.0 steals.</p>
