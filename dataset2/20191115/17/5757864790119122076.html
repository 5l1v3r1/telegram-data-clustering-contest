      <p>With the recent debut of both Disney+ and Apple TV+, not to mention upcoming launches for HBO Max, NBC’s Peacock, and more, streaming services are officially coming for cable television’s throne—and might sneakily empty your bank account while they're at it.</p>
      <p>While a monthly fee of $10 to $15 seems easy enough to justify if you’re willing to sacrifice a burrito bowl or fancy cocktail once a month, the little voice in the back of your head is probably whispering, “but it still adds up.” To find out just how much, MarketWatch created a <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/before-you-sign-up-for-disney-this-calculator-adds-up-the-true-cost-of-your-streaming-services-2019-11-13">calculator</a> that will not only tell you how much you’re spending on streaming services every month; it’ll also add up the lifetime cost of all those entertainment expenses.</p>
      <p>The calculator covers Netflix, CBS All Access, Hulu, Amazon Prime, Sling TV, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/section/disney">Disney+</a>, Apple TV+, and YouTube TV, and it also includes a whole host of add-ons that you might not even have realized were available. Through Amazon Prime, for example, you can subscribe to HBO, Showtime, and other premium channels—but there are also more niche options like Hallmark Movies Now and NickHits (with <i>iCarly</i>, <i>The Fairly OddParents</i>, and other Nickelodeon classics).</p>
      <p>As you check off services and add-ons, you’ll see your monthly bill on the right side of the total box, and the lifetime cost—which accounts for 50 years of streaming, adjusted for inflation—will balloon before your eyes on the left side. Below that, there’s an even larger number labeled as the lifetime “true” cost, which estimates how much you would’ve made if you had invested that money instead.</p>
      <p>For example: If you sign up for basic monthly subscriptions to <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/64325/13-facts-about-netflix-recommended-you">Netflix</a> and Disney+ for $9 and $7, respectively, your lifetime cost totals around $16,200. However, if you had opted to invest that money, the 50-year prediction sees you walking away with almost $74,000.</p>
      <p>Having said that, it’s understandably hard to look that far into the future, especially when Disney+ is tempting you with the <i>Lizzie McGuire</i> series, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/section/star-wars"><i>Star Wars</i></a> spinoff <i>The Mandalorian</i>, and practically every beloved animated <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/84746/3-things-never-allowed-disney-movie">Disney movie</a> from your childhood.</p>
