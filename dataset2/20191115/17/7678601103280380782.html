      <h1>Feeling peckish?: Eat all the chicken you want at Tokyo’s buffet-style KFC</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:15:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:15</time> by <a rel="author">News Desk</a></address>
      <p>Japan is taking KFC to an all-new level, as <a href="https://japantoday.com/category/features/food/kfc-opens-all-you-can-eat-and-drink-buffet-restaurant-in-tokyo">a buffet-style KFC restaurant has just opened in Tokyo</a>, according to a report by Japan Today on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The family-themed restaurant is located at Minami Machida Grandberry Park, and it has an all-you-can-eat buffet available day and night, all year round.</p>
      <p>The 50 items on the menu include KFC’s original-recipe fried chicken, fries, pasta and dessert, as well as their restaurant-exclusive dishes, which include “Special Fried Chicken Soup Curry” and a pan-baked potato casserole.</p>

      <p>The all-you-can-eat buffet must be enjoyed in 80 minutes. It includes free flowing soft drinks, but those in the mood for booze can opt for all-you-can-drink alcohol for an additional charge.</p>
      <p>The prices are considered reasonable as well, at least by Japanese standards. A lunch package is priced at 1,980 yen (US$ 18.24) for adults and 980 yen for children. The dinner package is more expensive, with 2,580 yen for adults and 1,280 yen for children.</p>
      <p>Often going the extra mile to intrigue customers and drive sales, KFC previously released fried chicken-scented bath bombs and a Colonel Sanders dating simulator. (vel/mut)</p>
