      <p>Nov. 15 (UPI) -- CM Punk discussed his return to the world of professional wrestling and his new role on <i>WWE Backstage</i> in a new behind-the-scenes featurette.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euo_wjb8C6E">The video</a>, released on Friday, was filmed right before Punk made his surprise appearance on <i>Backstage</i>, the first time he had been seen on WWE programming since January 2014.</p>
      <p>"I wouldn't even be able to tell you with a straight face that I wasn't nervous at all. It's a space that I haven't been in, in five, six years," the former grappler said as he made his way to the show.</p>
      <p>"Compounded by the fans who have always clamored for me to come back to this space, so even if it's not me actually wrestling, I still think this feels like a big deal," he continued.</p>
      <p>Punk later mentioned the type of impact he wants to make with his return.</p>
      <p>"I'm not going to break the internet. I'm going to break the world," the 41-year-old said.</p>
      <p>Punk, during his <i>WWE Backstage </i>appearance, said that he <a href="https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/TV/2019/11/13/CM-Punk-returns-to-WWE-will-appear-on-Backstage/1751573644773/">will be back</a> on the analysis show next week. The program airs every Tuesday at 11 p.m. EDT on FS1.</p>
      <p>Punk was one of WWE's biggest stars, having held a world championship six times including a record-breaking reign as WWE Champion for 434 days. He enjoyed epic feuds with the likes of <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/John-Cena/?tps=1">John Cena</a>, Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, The Undertaker, <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Daniel-Bryan/?tps=1">Daniel Bryan</a> and <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Brock-Lesnar/?tps=1">Brock Lesnar</a>.</p>
