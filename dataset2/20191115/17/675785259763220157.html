      <h2>Man Utd have placed Borussia Dortmund winger Jadon Sancho and RB Salzburg's high rated hit man Erling-Braut Haaland high on their January transfer window wish list</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author">David McDonnell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-mcdonnell/</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United are weighing up January moves for their top two transfer targets – Jadon Sancho and Erling-Braut Haaland.</p>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has identified the 19-year-old duo as his priority targets, with United ready to move swiftly when the window re-opens, to try to land them ahead of their rivals.</p>
      <p>Both are likely to cost United close to £200million, with Borussia Dortmund and England winger Sancho valued at £100m and RB Salzburg and Norway striker Haaland at £85m.</p>
      <p>Sancho is having a difficult time at Dortmund, with United alerted to his potential availability in January, rather than next summer, when they had planned to move for him.</p>

      <p>Despite a clutch of goals and assists already this season, Sancho was hauled off after just 36 minutes of Dortmund's recent clash with title rivals Bayern Munich.</p>
      <p>That came on the back of Sancho being fined by Dortmund for returning late from England duty following last month's international break.</p>
      <p>The feeling at United is there is an opportunity to take advantage of the discord between Sancho and Dortmund, with a January bid that could ultimately suit both parties.</p>

      <p>United tried to sign Sancho last summer, but their failure to make the Champions League scuppered any potential deal, with the former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> star singing a new contract with Dortmund.</p>
      <p>With Haaland, United hope his relationship with Solskjaer, who managed him at Molde, can give them a head start over their rivals in the race to sign Europe's most prolific young striker.</p>
      <p>Haaland, son of former City and Leeds midfielder Alf-Inge, has made an explosive start to the season, scoring 22 goals in 16 appearances, including seven in the Champions League.</p>
      <p>United have had Haaland watched several times this season, with Solskjaer sending Simon Wells, one of his most senior and trusted scouts, to assess the youngster in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>Haaland's exploits have made him one of the most sought-after young players in the world, with one hurdle for United being his apparent favouring of a move to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> or <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> .</p>
      <p>Both Spanish clubs are also tracking Haaland, but United will not be put off by interest from their more illustrious rivals and their ability to guarantee Champions League football.</p>
      <p>If United were successful in their pursuit of Haaland, one option would be to loan him back to RB Salzburg for the remainder of the season, delaying his permanent move until next summer.</p>
