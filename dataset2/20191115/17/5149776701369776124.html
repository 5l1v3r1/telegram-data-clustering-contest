      <h1>Bingham residents pay tribute to 39-year-old mum after double death at house</h1>
      <h2>Police still at the scene where an incident occurred on Wednesday afternoon</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:35:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:35</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Jarram</a></address>
      <p>Heartbroken staff from a Bingham care home have paid tribute to a 39-year-old woman who died following an incident at her home address.</p>
      <p>Police are still guarding the property in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/">Porchester Road</a> as they establish what happened after a 57-year-old man and 39-year-old woman were found dead on Wednesday, November 13.</p>
      <p>Dozens of flowers have been passed to police officers to place outside the door of her home, with friends and employees in tears as they approach the driveway.</p>
      <p>The identity of the male and female have not yet been disclosed by the police nor has the circumstances surrounding their deaths.</p>
      <p>But colleagues of the 39-year-old mum said she worked as a senior carer at Beauvale Care Home in Moor Lane in Bingham.</p>
      <p>Close friend and carer at Beauvale, Cheryl Terry, said she had worked there for 12 years and was loved by both patients and staff.</p>

      <p>She said: "We had lots of laughs. She was a very inspiring lady.</p>
      <p>"It is a horrible nightmare that she has gone. My memory of her was moving her into this house. She had lived in Bingham before, but in a little flat."</p>
      <p>Tanya Foster, 24, who works in the kitchens at Beauvale, was also horrified by the news of her death.</p>
      <p>She said: "She was easy to get along with. She had goals. She had not long passed her driving test in October. She just wanted to achieve.</p>
      <p>"She was lovely. I have only been at the care home a month or two and she used to say 'hello' to me every day and ask me how I was.</p>

      <p>"Everyone enjoyed her, she was a hard worker, and always busy.</p>
      <p>"She will be greatly missed. It is just a shock to everyone. We all wish it was not true."</p>
      <p>Kim Smith, 29, a carer at the home, added: "She was loving and caring. We were like a family."</p>
      <p>Officers were called to the address just before 3.40pm on Wednesday, November 13.</p>
      <p>Nottinghamshire Police said <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/full-police-statement-after-man-3536108">the man and woman are believed to be known to one another</a>, and were both pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
      <p>Post-mortem examinations are taking place to establish the exact cause of death.</p>
