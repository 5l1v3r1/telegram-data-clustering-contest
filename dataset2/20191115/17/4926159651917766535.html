      <h1>2019: South African cricket's annus horribilis</h1>

        <i>It has rarely been this bad for South African cricket. On the field, the team is reeling from five consecutive Test-match defeats, their worst performance at a World Cup, and the retirements of the last members of their golden generation. Off it, Cricket South Africa (CSA) is trying to put out fires in every corner - from court battles against the South African Cricketers' Association (SACA) to internal matters that have seen three senior members of staff suspended for alleged dereliction of duty. Not to forget, the board is drowning in debt.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Since their readmission, South Africa have lost more Tests in a year (7 out of 11 in 2016), dealt with bigger controversies (think Hansie Cronje), and gone through financial struggles, most notably when India cut short their 2013-14 tour, which denied CSA revenues of approximately R 300 million (USD 19.8 million approx). But to have all these in the same year makes 2019 quite the annus horribilis.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Here's a look back at just how bad it has been.</i>

Project 654 includes restructuring the domestic system, eliminating the franchise tier completely, and resorting to a 12-team provincial structure.</li>
