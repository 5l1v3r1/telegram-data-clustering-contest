      <h1>Bafana Sweat Over Injury To Star Man</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:29:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:29</time> by <a rel="author">Mazola Molefe</a></address>
      <p>Bongani Zungu is a serious doubt for Bafana Bafana’s home game against Sudan on Sunday as they attempt to get their 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualification back on track.</p>
      <p>The midfielder was an early forced substitute in the national team’s 2-0 defeat away to Ghana in their opening Group C fixture in Cape Coast, with coach Molefi Ntseki  suggesting he could miss the second game at Orlando Stadium. </p>

      <p>But it is believed the medical team is working around the clock to have him available for selection to add bite to Bafana’s midfield – he immediately had a knee brace on as national team doctor Thulani Ngwenya managed the injury.  </p>
      <p>“We should have everyone available for our home game against Sudan, with the exception of Bongani Zungu,” was Molefi’s response to reporters in Ghana.</p>
      <p>With the player having to be taken off on a stretcher after just 30 minutes, it’s obvious that Ntseki feared the worst. </p>
      <p>However, no call has been made on Zungu yet and he is expected to go for a scan to determine the extent of his injury when Bafana arrive back in Johannesburg late this afternoon.</p>
