      <h1>GitHub Preserves its Code in the Arctic World Archive</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:24:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macobserver.com/author/andrew-orr/" target="_blank">Andrew Orr</a></address>
      <p>GitHub plans to store all of its open source code in the Arctic World Archive to prepare for possible doomsday scenarios.</p>
      <blockquote>The data is stored on reels of film coated with iron oxide powder. It can be read by a computer or — in the event of a global power outage — a human with a magnifying glass. Crucially, this film will last for 1,000 years. Among the first data deposit at the vault is the source code for Android and Linux operations systems, as well as a range of programming languages, web platforms, cryptocurrencies and AI tools. GitHub is planning on having all active public repositories stored by February 2020.</blockquote>
      <p>This sounds like a neat project. It also sounds like the Arctic World Archive is “around the corner” from the Doomsday seed vault, another preservation project. Note: The photo I chose for the featured image is of that seed vault.</p>
