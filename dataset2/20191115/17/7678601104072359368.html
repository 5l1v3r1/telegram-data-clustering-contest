      <h1>Instagrammable exhibition seeks to instill positive attitudes in millennials, Gen Z</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:30:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:30</time> by <a rel="author">Jessicha Valentina</a></address>
      <p>Thanks to modern technology, millennials and members of Gen Z now have a wider choice of new professions, such as data scientists, social media managers and content creators.</p>
      <p>However, amid the variety of jobs some people are still reluctant to try their luck in these new fields.</p>
      <p>Alamanda Shantika Santoso, founder of a free technology school, the Binar Academy, said in a Generasi #BisaBanget press conference in Jakarta on Thursday that she still encountered young people who were hesitant about following their dreams and who preferred to choose old-fashioned jobs.</p>
      <p>Realizing the challenges faced by millennials and Gen Z, the Nestlé Bear Brand is hosting the Generasi #BisaBanget<i> </i>Playspace until Nov. 24 at the Senayan City shopping mall in Jakarta, aiming to inspire and motivate the younger generations to achieve their dreams.</p>
      <p>“As has been highlighted by many, the future lies with millennials and Gen Z,” said Nestlé Indonesia ready-to-drink marketing manager Ahmad Afid, adding that youth have a lot of potential.</p>
      <p>The event features #BisaBanget Inspiration Rooms and Inspiration Classes.</p>
      <p>There are seven Inspiration Rooms, each displaying the highs and lows of life in whimsical styles.</p>

      <p>Inside the Inspiration Rooms, visitors can take photos and browse through motivational quotes and playful designs.</p>
      <p>To create the rooms, the Nestlé Bear Brand teamed up with Haluu, an organizer of Instagrammable exhibitions.</p>
      <p>Ahmad said that the company wanted to effectively send positive messages through a medium suitable for millennials and Gen Z. Armed with Haluu's knowledge of the younger generations, they became the perfect partners for the exhibition.</p>
      <p>“We see that [the younger generations] want content [for social media]: not only photos, but also inspirational and positive contents,” said Ahmad.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the #BisaBanget Inspiration Classes feature talks on a variety of topics, varying from cash flow for first-jobbers, pre-loved goods, arts and mental health to food blogging and how to create high quality YouTube contents.</p>
      <p>Ahmad said the entire event is open to the public and free of charge.</p>
      <p>He expressed the hope that the event would be able to instill a <i>#BisaBanget</i> (can do) spirit in the younger generations, allowing them to have positive attitudes for facing challenges and making positive contributions. (wng)</p>
