      <p>Nov. 15 (UPI) -- <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Roger_Stone/?tps=1">Roger Stone</a>, a political operative and former adviser to President <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Donald_Trump/?tps=1">Donald Trump</a>'s campaign, was convicted Friday on seven criminal counts -- in the final prosecution related to the Justice Department's two-year Russia investigation.</p>
      <p>Stone, 67, <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/politics/Roger-Stone-Jury-Verdict-Obstruction-Fraud-Case-564980452.html">was convicted</a> on charges that include obstruction, making false statements and witness tampering. He is the sixth Trump staffer <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/roger-stone-jury-weighs-evidence-and-a-defense-move-to-make-case-about-mueller/2019/11/15/554fff5a-06ff-11ea-8292-c46ee8cb3dce_story.html">to be convicted</a> on charges related to the investigation of special counsel <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Robert_Mueller/?tps=1">Robert Mueller</a>, which sought to determine whether Trump's campaign colluded with Moscow to interfere in the election.</p>
      <p>The charges stem from testimony Stone had given to House intelligence committee, in which he lied about his WikiLeaks contacts during the 2016 campaign. He was a key part of the investigation, prosecutors argued, because he was an "access point" for WikiLeaks due to frequent claims he had insider information.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors used some of Stone's private text messages as evidence, arguing they contradicted the details he gave House investigators.</p>
      <p>Police arrested Stone and raided his Florida home <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2019/01/25/Trump-confidant-Roger-Stone-indicted-in-Mueller-probe-says-charges-politically-motivated/9011548416852/">in January</a>. He will be sentenced Feb. 6.</p>
