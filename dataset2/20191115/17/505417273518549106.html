        <b>The Welsh Rugby Union have confirmed that former captain Sam Warburton will join Wayne Pivac’s background team ahead of the 2020 Six Nations.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The former flanker retired in the summer of 2018, a year after leading the British and Irish Lions to a series draw against the All Blacks.</p>
      <p>Warburton’s role will be a technical advisor for the breakdown/defence.</p>
      <p>Former Scarlets assistant coach Byron Hayward will come in as Wales’ defence coach, a role he held previously with the Llanelli region.</p>
      <p>Hayward and Warburton will be a part of a six-man coaching staff which includes head coach Pivac alongside Stephen Jones, Jonathan Humphreys and Neil Jenkins.</p>
      <p>“I’m delighted to bring both Byron and Sam into the set-up and add to what is already a vastly experienced coaching team,” said Pivac.</p>

      <p>“Both individuals are highly respected, knowledgeable and experienced in their disciplines and will add a great deal to the environment. Byron has a great coaching CV with experience in England, the club game in Wales, the age-grade system and his five successful years with the Scarlets.</p>
      <blockquote>“Sam is one of the most experienced leaders in rugby with excellent knowledge and communication skills and having only recently retired he has a full grasp on the international game. We looked at the coaching structure and the roles of each coach and believed by adding a second defensive role into the team adds value, adds a point of difference and allows a specialist to work in the contact area and I believe Byron and Sam will compliment each other in the roles.”</blockquote>
      <p>Warburton said: “I’m delighted to be part of the senior national coaching team. It is a genuine privilege to be considered for such a role and I can’t wait to do my upmost to contribute to help improve the team and players. With such a great group of players and management it is an amazing opportunity which I am very proud to be given”</p>
