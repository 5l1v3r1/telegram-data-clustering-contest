      <h1>Sarkodie goes after Twitter Inc over his wife’s unverified Twitter account</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:53:08+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.ghbase.com/author/staff/" target="_blank">Nana Yaw</a></address>
      <p>Ghanaian rap star, Michael Owusu Addo, popularly known as <a href="http://www.ghbase.com/read-sarkodies-funny-reply-to-an-sm-fan-who-begged-him-for-money-because-his-girlfriend-is-pregnant/">Sarkodie</a> has asked for his wife’s Twitter account to be verified.</p>
      <p>Many people didn’t really know who Tracy was until she gave birth to Sarkodie’s daughter, Adalyn Owusu. Since then, she has been in the limelight and has been involved in outdoor events, especially Sarkodie’s annual concert, Rapperholic.</p>
      <p>Tracy Owusu Addo aka Tracy SarkCess, who has over 200,000 followers on Instagram has the verification badge but her Twitter page which has over 70,000 followers is yet to be verified.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.ghbase.com/it-was-sarkodie-i-wanted-to-feature-on-wiase-ye-de-rmx-not-kwesi-arthur-quamina-mp/">Sarkodie</a> who seems impatient by Twitter Inc’s delay to verify his wife’s account took to the micro-blogging platform to ask why Twitter is hesitating to verify Tracy.</p>
      <p><i><b>“Erm @Twitter what y’all waiting before you verify madam @TracySarkcess Account?? 😊 or is it because she doesn’t tweet on the #Regular?,”</b></i> he tweeted.</p>
