      <p>As scheduled, the <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/14/lenovo-z6-pro-5g-teased-in-promotional-video/">Lenovo Z6 Pro 5G</a> was officially announced today in China with a price tag of 3299 yuan, around $470 or 430€. Which makes it the most affordable 5G-ready phone on the planet. This specific variant also comes with 8GB RAM and 256GB of internal storage.</p>

      <p>According to Lenovo’s spokesperson, the “Lenovo Z6 Pro 5G breaks through the industry price limit and becomes a true 5G popular mobile phone, leading the popularity of 5G”. The smartphone will support three major Chinese operators along with 5G+4G dual card dual standby technology. This means buyers will be able to use both 4G and 5G SIMs at the same time.</p>
      <p>At the Lenovo event we also learned that the Lenovo Z6 Pro 5G will support a download peak speed of up to 2.02Gbps; while the maximum upload speed will be 406Mbps. In a real life scenario, you can download a 1.6GB game like “Peace Elite” in just 6 seconds. Alternatively, you can download 200 lossless-grade songs in 39 seconds (about 10GB) or a 25GB-large Blu-ray original movie collection in only 1.5 minutes.</p>

      <p>The smartphone is able to achieve these speeds thanks to the integrated Qualcomm Snapdragon X50 5G modem. We then find a 5G 4×4 MIMO antenna for a stable and smooth 5G network connection and a 360° anti-attenuation antenna, which enables users to receive stronger signals under different holding positions.</p>
      <p>As far as other components are concerned, the Z6 Pro 5G is equipped with a 6.39-inch display with a resolution of 2340 × 1080 and a notch. We then find Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 855 CPU and four rear cameras. These include a main 48MP camera, a 16MP ultra wide lens, an 8MP telephoto lens and a 2MP depth sensor. On the front we’ll instead have a 32MP selfie snapper.</p>

      <p>Finally, Lenovo’s Z6 Pro 5G also adopts a 2.0 liquid cooling system to increase the heat dissipation area by 20%. Basically they throw more heat dissipating material at the problem (silicone sheet, copper tube, gel, graphite).</p>
