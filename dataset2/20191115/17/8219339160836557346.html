      <h1>Robin launches ProLine Compact as the latest HomeKit enabled doorbell</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:01:39+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/michaelpotuck/" target="_blank">Michael Potuck</a></address>
      <p>Robin was the first company to receive HomeKit certification for a smart doorbell and <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/01/11/robin-homekit-doorbell/">launched the ProLine back in February</a>. Now the company is back with a smaller version, the ProLine Compact and it offers HomeKit support as well as a lower price with HomeKit Secure Video coming next month.</p>
      <p>Robin’s Proline Doorbell was exciting as it ushered in the era of HomeKit doorbells. However, it came with a price of $660, a large design, and it wasn’t as straightforward to install as many <a href="https://amzn.to/2qVQLbg">competitors’ smart doorbells</a>.</p>
      <p>Now Robin is out today with the <a href="https://www.robin.nl/en/shop.html">ProLine Compact</a> that offers the same industrial design but with a smaller package and lower price tag than its big brother but still pricey at roughly $546 (495€).</p>
      <h3>ProLine Compact highlights:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>HomeKit support</b>
        </li>
        <li><b>Camera</b>: 5 megapixel IP camera with 130-degree wide-angle lens.</li>
        <li><b>Resolution:</b> HD video (720p)</li>
        <li><b>Power</b>: Power over Ethernet (PoE IEEE 802.3af)</li>
        <li><b>Housing</b>: Anodised aluminum (3 mm) with a brushed finish. Dome made from hardened optical glass with photochromatic properties for protecting the lens. Engravable and LED-backlit key.</li>
        <li><b>Relay:</b> 1 integrated dry relay, normally openend, max 48V/60W</li>
        <li><b>Ingress Protection: </b>IP53</li>
        <li><b>Dimensions</b><b>: </b>94,5 mm (w) x 150,5 mm (h) x 44,5 mm (d)</li>
        <li><b>Warranty: </b>48 months (carry-in DDP)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Robin previously committed to <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/06/07/homekit-doorbell-ios-13/">bringing HomeKit Secure Video support</a> to its ProLine doorbell. And Robin says the ProLine Compact will receive it as well via software update in December.</p>
      <p>The ProLine Compact is available now in <a href="https://www.robin.nl/en/shop.html">silver, space gray, and onyx black direct from Robin</a> and Robin remains the only company to offer a HomeKit doorbell option.</p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/01/08/netatmo-homekit-video-doorbell/">Netatmo has slated its HomeKit doorbell with HomeKit Secure Video</a> support to launch this year. Hopefully, we’ll see it land before long.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, new <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/10/17/arlo-video-doorbell/">doorbell products from Arlo</a> and <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/05/august-view-smart-doorbell-available-again/">August have arrived without HomeKit</a>, even though other <a href="https://amzn.to/2rJp2Lf">smart products include it</a> from both companies’ smart locks and cameras.</p>
      <p>In related news, Logitech was the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/14/logitech-cirlce-2-homekit-secure-video/">first to launch support for HomeKit Secure Video</a> yesterday for its wired <a href="https://amzn.to/2NRvRDl">Circle 2 smart camera</a>.</p>
