      <p>A pregnant woman was forced to escape through a second floor window after arsonists set fire to the flats where she lived, a court has heard.</p>
      <p>An old mattress had been dragged into the communal area of the block, dowsed in petrol, and set alight.</p>
      <p>A number of residents in the 10-flat building escaped through windows as the smoke and heat engulfed the property, while others shut themselves in their flats and waited for firefighters.</p>
      <p>The pair who set the fire - Darren Griffiths and Rebecca Thomas - have been deemed dangerous offenders, and given extended sentences.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/swansea-crown-court">Swansea Crown Court</a> heard that just after midnight on August 19 the pair were seen going to a block of flats on Larch Road on <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/milford-haven">Milford Haven</a> 's Mount estate.</p>
      <p>Hannah George, prosecuting, said 24-year-old Thomas had been in a relationship with a resident of block - a man known as "Brummie" - and she "did not feel well disposed to him".</p>

      <p>The court heard the pair dragged an old mattress which had been abandoned outside the building into the communal area, and placed it against a wooden door.</p>
      <p>Griffiths, aged 37, then returned with a can of petrol, threw its contents over the mattress, and set light to it.</p>
      <p>The pair fled the scene as the fire quickly took hold in the council-owned three-storey block.</p>
      <p>The prosecutor read statements from a number of residents who described the terror of being in the burning building.</p>
      <p>One man who lived on the second floor with his pregnant partner said he heard a smoke alarm go off and opened his front door to see what was going on. He said the smoke and heat outside the flat was so intense there was no way they could use the stairs to escape.</p>
      <p>He said his partner had to be lowered out of a bedroom window into the arms of members of the public who were standing below. He then jumped to safety after she was on the ground.</p>
      <p>Miss George said another resident described how she looked through the spy hole in her front door and saw smoke in the hallway. The resident described how her front door then started turning black and began to crack, and she thought it was going to "explode".</p>
      <p>Another resident used sheets and towels to block the gaps around the front door to the flat and retreated to a bedroom to await rescue by the fire brigade.</p>
      <p>Others on the ground floor made good their escape through windows.</p>

      <p>The court heard the defendants were arrested later the same day.</p>
      <p>Griffiths gave a largely "no comment" interview but Thomas said the pair had drunk a litre of vodka after spending the evening in a pub, and she had wanted to go to Milford Haven to buy the drug spice.</p>
      <p>She said Griffiths wanted a mattress so he could live in the back of his van, and she told him she knew where they could find one after having previously seen a mattress outside the Mount estate block.</p>
      <p>The prosecutor said the cost of repairing the fire and smoke damaged building was more than Â£25,600, and all the occupants had to be temporarily rehoused while the work was done.</p>
      <p>Griffiths, of Pembroke Street, <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/pembroke">Pembroke Dock</a> , and Thomas, of Glebelands, Johnston, had both previously pleaded guilty to arson with intent to endanger life when they appeared in the dock together.</p>
      <p>Griffiths has eight previous convictions for 15 offences including for burglary, possession of a knife, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, unlawful wounding, battery, and arson of a vehicle.</p>
      <p>Thomas has one previous conviction for four offences, all committed when she was a youth.</p>
      <p>Dyfed Thomas, for Griffiths, accepted his client's antecedent record "did him no favours" but he pointed out the defendant's previous arson conviction was some time ago, and did not involve property.</p>
      <p>Jon Tarrant, for Thomas, said the defendant had had a "traumatic upbringing", and her life had spiralled into the abuse of drink and drugs following "tragic family events".</p>
      <p>Judge Keith Thomas said it was fortunate the fire alarms in the block of flats had been working, and that firefighters were able to get to the scene and deal with the blaze in time.</p>
      <p>He said is was clear from the pre-sentence reports he had read on the defendants both currently presented a significant risk of harm to the public if allowed to remain in the community.</p>
      <p>Judge Thomas said he was satisfied both could properly be classified as dangerous offenders under the meaning of the relevant legislation.</p>
      <p>Griffiths was handed a nine year extended sentence comprising six years in prison, and a three year extended licence period. Thomas was given an eight year and three months extended sentence comprising five years and three months in custody followed by a three year licence period.</p>
      <p>Both defendants will have to serve two-thirds of the custodial element of their sentences before they can apply for parole, however they will only be released if the Parole Board no longer considers them a risk.</p>
