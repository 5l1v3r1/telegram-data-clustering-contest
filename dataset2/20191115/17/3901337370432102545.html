      <p>The derby was originally set to take place on 26 October at the Camp Nou, but due to political unrest in Catalonia, it was subsequently rescheduled for 18 December in Madrid.</p>
      <p>Ramos did not seem happy about the decision as his side will have 24 hours less rest than their bitter rivals ahead of the heavily anticipated clash.</p>
      <p>"In the end, the only ones that are at a disadvantage by this are us. It's a pity that we didn't play the Clasico when it was meant to be played (on 26 October) because both teams would have gone into that Saturday game having had the same (rest)," the Los Blancos defender said, according to <i>Bleacher Report.</i></p>
      <p>In response to his complaints, Pique looked to remind his ex-Spain colleague that there have been other times when players from Barca had less rest.</p>

      <p>"There is always some kind of complaint," the Catalan defender told <i>Cadena Cope</i>.</p>
      <p>"The game had to have been played the day it had to be played. If it had been the other way around, Barca would have complained (about having less rest).</p>
      <p>"The players are used to playing games two or three days apart. At Barca-Madrid, you look at everything with a magnifying glass.</p>
      <p>"Surely if we look at other times, we have had less rest than Madrid. We did not propose to postpone the game. This started with (La Liga president Javier) Tebas, who proposed to play in Madrid and from there we played on 18 December. We don't complain."</p>
