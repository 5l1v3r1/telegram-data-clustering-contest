      <h1>The physics of lawn sprinklers, the hazy mist of the Standard Model, careers in medical physics</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:17:03+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://physicsworld.com/author/hamish-johnston/" target="_blank">Hamish Johnston</a></address>
      <p>Here in Bristol the climate is ideal for a carefree lawn – it rarely gets very hot and we usually get enough rain to make it through the summer without the need for a lawn sprinkler. As a result, I miss the hiss of sprinklers that were part of my youthful summers in Canada. In <i>Wired</i>, the physicist Rhett Allain looks at the fascinating physics of lawn sprinklers – and the optical illusions they can create – in “<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-mesmerizing-science-of-garden-sprinklers/">The mesmerizing science of garden sprinklers</a>”.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, Allain does not look at the physics of impact sprinklers (see above image), which used to fascinate me as a child with their seemingly chaotic behaviour.</p>
      <p>If I had a penny for every time a wrote a phrase like “…this new experiment could provide tantalizing hints of what physics lies beyond the Standard Model” I would be a pound or two richer. In “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04604">The once and present Standard Model of elementary particle physics</a>” James Wells of the University of Michigan looks into the “hazy mist” of the model since its birth with the discovery of charm in 1974 (Wells’ definition, not mine).</p>
      <p>One chapter is called “Facts, mysteries and myths”, which advocates constructing a myth for how neutrinos obtain mass and describes the cosmological constant, dark matter, baryogenesis, and inflation as four “mysteries of the cosmos”.</p>
      <p>If you have given up on improving the Standard Model, you might fancy becoming a medical physicist. There is a nice article in <i>Symmetry </i>that asks five former particle physicists why they chose that career path and what they do now as medical physicists.  You can read more in “<a href="https://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/transitions-into-medical-physics">Transitions into medical physics</a>” by Catherine Steffel.</p>
