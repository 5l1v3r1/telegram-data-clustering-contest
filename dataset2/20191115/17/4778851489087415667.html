        <b>HMRC has insisted they did not make any mistakes with regards to the tax bill handed down to Rangers at the beginning of this decade.</b>

      <p><a href="https://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/rangers/rangers-overcharged-50m-in-tax-bill-which-led-to-liquidation-according-to-reports-1-5045604"><b>READ MORE - Rangers' overcharged £50m in tax bill which led to liquidation, according to reports<br/></b></a>A story appeared in The Times on Thursday which sent shockwaves throughout Scottish football as it claimed the former operating company of the Ibrox side had been billed for £50 million more than they should have.</p>
      <p>This led to Rangers commentators, including ex-player and manager Ally McCoist, insisting that without the taxman's "blunder" the club would not have faced administration and liquidation in 2012.</p>
      <p>HMRC has since refuted the article. Their official Twitter account sent out a tweet late on Thursday evening where they insisted they "did not miscalculate anything".</p>
      <p>Now chief executive and first permanent secretary Jim Harra has written to the editor of The Times to give their side of the story.</p>
      <p>The letter was posted on Twitter. It read: "I am writing in relation to your coverage of Rangers' tax affairs on 14 November 2019. The article is incorrect: HMRC did not make any mistakes that led to the club's insolvency.</p>

      <p>"HMRC won against Rangers' tax avoidance in the Supreme Court. We have a long-standing claim with the liquidators to recover the money due as a result of this judgement.</p>
      <p>"The United Kingdom has one of the lowest rates of unpaid tax anywhere in the world. Inaccurate and partial reporting only serves to undermine public trust in the tax system.</p>
      <p>"HMRC is committed to getting tax right, for everyone - adn to challenge tax avoidance wherever we find it. We make sure large businesses, like all other taxpayers, pay the taxes due under UK law."</p>
