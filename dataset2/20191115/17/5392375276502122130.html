      <p>Galaxy A50 firmware update brought an issue to fingerprint registration<br/>3.7 (73.33%) 3 votes</p>
      <p>The Galaxy A50 has been one of <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/Samsung">Samsung’s</a> greatest hits in 2019. The handset came to reinvent the company’s portfolio of mid-range devices packing solid specifications and neat design. The company has been doing a good job in terms of software support, and we expect to see Android 10 reaching this device in the next year. However, the latest software update brought an issue to the fingerprint scanner.</p>
      <p>According to reports from Galaxy A50 users running on firmware versions <i>A505FNXXS3ASK9 </i>and <i>A505FDDS3ASK8</i> they can’t register new fingerprints. That’s a curious issue, after all, the aforementioned updates came to improve the fingerprint recognition. During the rollout, Samsung advised users that it would be necessary to re-register their fingerprints in order to benefit from the performance upgrade. However, this hasn’t been the case for users running the new firmware.</p>

      <p>Apparently enrollment process stops working at around the 41% mark and prompts them to make sure the sensor area is clean. Some users managed to complete the process, but then the phone rejects the newly enrolled fingerprints. If you already have a registered fingerprint on your Galaxy A50, it’s best to not remove it since it’s the only way to use it for now. If you delete it, you can’t register a new fingerprint until Samsung pushes a new update to fix this issue.</p>
      <p>Hopefully, the South-Korean firm won’t take much longer to fix this terrible issue. Nowadays, a large part of users relies on their fingerprint scanners to avoid inserting passwords all the time.</p>
