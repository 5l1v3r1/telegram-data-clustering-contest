      <h1>ATP Finals: Rafael Nadal Sweats On Semis Spot After Beating Stefanos Tsitsipas</h1>
      <h2>Rafael Nadal has never won the end-of-season tournament and had a miserable start at the O2 Arena, being outplayed by Germany's Alexander Zverev.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:22:46+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:22</time> by <a rel="author">Agence France-Presse</a></address>
      <p>Rafael Nadal recovered to beat Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-7 (4/7), 6-4, 7-5 on Friday but faces an anxious wait to find out whether he will qualify for the last four at the <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/tennis/atp-finals-matteo-berrettini-makes-history-with-consolation-win-in-london-2132707">ATP Finals</a>. The Spanish top seed is pinning his hopes on <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/tennis/atp-finals-rafael-nadal-beats-daniil-medvedev-to-keep-dream-alive-2132098">Daniil Medvedev</a> beating defending champion Alexander Zverev in the evening match in Group Andre Agassi in London.</p>
      <p>Nadal, who has already secured the year-end number one ranking, has never won the end-of-season tournament and had a miserable start at the O2 Arena, being outplayed by Germany's Zverev.</p>
      <p>But the 19-time Grand Slam champion produced an astonishing comeback to defeat Medvedev, the Russian fourth seed, on Wednesday and give himself a chance of qualifying from the round-robin phase.</p>
      <p>Tsitsipas, 21, had already qualified for the semi-finals before Friday's match after beating Medvedev and Zverev.</p>
      <p>Serve dominated in the first set on Friday, with neither Nadal nor Tsitsipas facing a break point as the match drifted inexorably towards a tie-break.</p>
      <p>The Greek sixth seed came out on top, hammering an ace on his first match point to seal the set.</p>
      <p>The second set followed a similar pattern until the fifth game, when a Tsitsipas double-fault handed Nadal two break points -- the first of the match.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard could not capitalise but he upped the pressure in Tsitsipas's next serve game and earned another break point, which the Greek again survived.</p>
      <p>But Nadal earned a fourth break point in Tsitsipas's next service game and this time the Greek player slapped a regulation forehand wide and Nadal went on to level the match.</p>
      <p>A pumped-up Nadal maintained his momentum in the early stages of the deciding set, putting consistent pressure on his opponent's serve but he failed to convert a clutch of break points.</p>
      <p>Nadal earned two more break points in the 11th game and this time made it count as Tsitsipas put a backhand wide and he served out to win the match.</p>
      <p>Nadal's efforts will count for nothing unless Medvedev beats Zverev in the later match at the O2 Arena. A win for the German would send Nadal home.</p>
      <p>If Medvedev, who cannot progress, beats Zverev, Nadal would face a mouthwatering match against Roger Federer.</p>
      <p><a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/tennis/atp-finals-roger-federer-outclasses-novak-djokovic-to-reach-semis-2132796">Six-time champion Federer</a>, who was in Group Bjorn Borg, secured a spot in the semi-finals for the 16th time in his career on Thursday by beating Novak Djokovic in straight sets.</p>
      <p>Austrian fifth seed Dominic Thiem also qualified for Saturday's semi-finals.</p>
