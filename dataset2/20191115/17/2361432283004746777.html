      <h1>Clive Owen to Play Bill Clinton on 'Impeachment: American Crime Story'</h1>
      <h2>He joins Sarah Paulson as Linda Tripp and Beanie Feldstein as Monica Lewinsky on Season 3 of Ryan Murphy anthology</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:53:35+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thewrap.com/author/tim-b/" target="_blank">Tim Baysinger</a></address>
      <p>Clive Owen will play Bill Clinton on the third season of FX’s “American Crime Story,” which will center on Clinton’s impeachment, an individual with knowledge of the project told TheWrap.</p>
      <p>FX did not immediately respond to TheWrap for a request for comment.</p>
      <p>Owen joins Sarah Paulson, Beanie Feldstein and Annaleigh Ashford in the series, which is executive produced by Monica Lewinsky. The third season of the anthology “unravels the national scandal that swept up Paula Jones (played by Ashford), Monica Lewinsky (Feldstein) and Linda Tripp (Paulson) as principal characters in the country’s first impeachment proceedings in over a century.”</p>

      <p>Sarah Burgess writes and will executive produce alongside Murphy, Nina Jacobson, Brad Simpson, Brad Falchuk, Larry Karaszewski, Scott Alexander, Alexis Martin Woodall and Sarah Paulson. Lewinsky will serve as producer on “Impeachment,” as will Feldstein, Henrietta Conrad and Jemima Khan.</p>
      <p>Production on “Impeachment: American Crime Story,” will begin in February 2019 and the season will premiere Sunday, Sept. 27, 2020 at 10:00 p.m. ET/PT on FX.</p>
      <p>The limited series is based on Jeffrey Toobin’s bestselling book “A Vast Conspiracy: The Real Story of the Sex Scandal That Nearly Brought Down a President,” and hails from Fox 21 Television Studios and FX Production.</p>
      <p>Last April, Murphy said he was <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/monica-lewinsky-american-crime-story-scrapped-ryan-murphy/">scrapping the proposed Lewinksy-Clinton-centric installment</a> of “American Crime Story” — which he had originally slated for Season 4 — telling <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/ryan-murphy-american-crime-story-future-scrapping-monica-lewinsky-season-1099146">The Hollywood Reporter</a>: “I told [Lewinksy], ‘Nobody should tell your story but you, and it’s kind of gross if they do. If you want to produce it with me, I would love that; but you should be the producer and you should make all the goddamn money.'”</p>
      <p>The first installment of “ACS,” “The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story” premiere in 2016. The second season, “The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story,” aired in 2018. Both seasons were critical darlings. The original plan for Season 3 was a story about the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/john-landgraf-foresees-many-more-cycles-of-ryan-murphys-ahs-and-american-crime-story-on-fx/">but Landgraf told reporters back in February, “As far as I know, ‘Katrina’ is not still in the mix.”</a></p>
