      <p>Nov. 15 (UPI) -- The makers of popular sandwich spread Nutella announced a contest to win a two-night stay at a pop-up hotel themed around the hazelnut treat.</p>

      <p>The contest, which calls on applicants to <a href="https://hotellanutella.com/">submit a one-minute video</a> explaining why they should be chosen, offers prizes of two nights at the Hotella Nutella, round-tip airfare, transportation from the airport to the hotel and a Nutella "breakfast experience" each morning of the Jan. 10-12 stay.</p>
      <p>The videos will be judged "based on creativity, passion for Nutella and connection to breakfast," the company said.</p>
