      <h1>Iron Man 3 is a Christmas Movie, According to Disney+</h1>

      <p>Every Christmas there's a bit of a debate about <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2018/12/hard-is-definitely-a-christmas-movie-and-why-its-a-wonderful-life-is-definitely-not/">whether <i>Die Hard</i> is a Christmas movie or not</a>, despite the obvious conclusion that it is. But in recent years another Christmas-adjacent film has popped up. A film that is set at Christmas, but wasn't about Christmas and didn't come out near December. Yes, I'm talking about <i>Iron Man 3.</i></p>
      <p>For those of you who don't remember, <i>Iron Man 3</i> is written and directed by Shane Black - who is notorious for setting his films around Christmas. Because he's really into Christmas, apparently. <i>Iron Man 3</i> was no exception.</p>
      <p>Despite coming out in the May of 2013, <i>Iron Man 3</i> is still mentioned to be set just before Christmas. Tony buys Pepper a giant stuffed rabbit as a present for instance, and various places are covered in Christmas lights -notably the city of Rose Hill.</p>
      <p>But Christmas plays no part in the plot. Not even a fleeting influence as was the case with <i>Die Hard</i>. So the question has stuck, is it a Christmas Movie? Well according to Disney+ it is. How do we know? Because searching for 'Christmas' on the streaming platform includes <i>Iron Man 3</i> in its results.</p>
      <p>So it joins the likes of <i>The Nightmare Before Christmas, A Christmas Carol, The Muppet Christmas Carol</i>, and more. Not <i>Die Hard</i>, though, because even though it was a Fox movie that's now owned by Disney, it's a bit too adult for Disney+.
