      <p>DeAndre Yedlin has spoken about life under Steve Bruce at Newcastle United.</p>
      <p>The USA international has had to fight his way back into the team following a summer operation on his groin and the arrival of Sweden international <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/emil-krafth">Emil Krafth.</a></p>
      <p>Bruce has challenged Yedlin to offer more going forward from right wing-back and the former Spurs defender responded with a diving header to haul his team back into the game in the 2-1 win over AFC Bournemouth last weekend.</p>
      <p>When asked about how he is enjoying life under a different boss, Yedlin told the Chronicle: "We all bought into his game plan and all bought into his tactics.</p>
      <p>"I think it shows.</p>
      <p>"When we go a goal down everybody is fighting on the pitch.</p>
      <p>"That is the main thing with his teams, it's to fight.</p>
      <p>"I think it has been a recurring thing over the years too, the guys on this team are fighters.</p>
      <p>"It's great for the club."</p>
      <p>Bruce has altered the United tactics in recent weeks and wants his wing-backs to be more of a threat as he looks to move away from the ultra defensive unit that kept Newcastle in the Premier League in recent years.</p>
      <p>He said: "In recent weeks Steve told me and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/jetro-willems">Jetro Willems</a> to get in the box a bit more to add another guy in the box.</p>
      <p>"Looking at it from a wing-back point of view when an extra body is coming forward it is tough to defend.</p>
      <p>"We have been trying to do that.</p>
      <p>"It has worked out a bit.</p>
      <p>"We're coming into the front and back post and hoping for something.</p>

      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>"First things first, it's about defending.</p>
      <p>"But as a defender if I can help produce goals and assists it brings even more to the team."</p>
      <p>United checkout for the international break with 15 points in the bag from their first 12 games.</p>
      <p>And while they are still 13th in the table, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">the Magpies</a> are within swinging distance of the upper reaches of the Premier League table.</p>
      <p>When asked if this season is an opportunity for one team to break away from the pack, Yedlin said: "Yeah, it's been on odd season.</p>
      <p>"You have - quote unquote - the so-called smaller teams beating bigger teams.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/newcastle-united-transfers-bruce-xhaka-17261999">Newcastle are ready to move in January transfer window if right player is available</a>
      </p>
      <p>"So it's been quite odd.</p>
      <p>"It just means that we are going to need to get as many points as possible because I think the bar for relegation will be raised a bit higher.</p>
      <p>"We just need to keep getting wins and points on the board."</p>
