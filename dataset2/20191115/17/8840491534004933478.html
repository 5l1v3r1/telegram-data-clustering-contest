      <p>In his address, he stated: “It’s great to see villages such as Belcarra benefitting from the investment under the Town and Village Renewal Scheme.</p>
      <p>“I have approved over €3.7 million for 38 projects in Co. Mayo under the scheme since 2016.</p>
      <p>“Each of the projects supported will contribute to improving the quality of life for the residents of those towns and villages.</p>
      <p>“This is a significant amount of money, making a huge difference to the lives of every citizen, from the young child cycling to school to the young at heart benefitting from safer walks in Belcarra." </p>
