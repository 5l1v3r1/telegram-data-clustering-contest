      <p>Renditions of Keertanas composed by social reformer and poet Kanakadasa and seminars on his contribution to socio-cultural life of Karnataka were held to mark his birth anniversary on Friday.</p>
      <p>Addressing the Kanaka Jayanti programme organised by the district administration at Kuvempu Rangamandir, writer Lingadahalli Halappa said through selective reading of the works of Kanakadasa, literary critics influenced by reactionary ideologies have tried to confine his poetic personality to devotion and spiritualism. Kanakadasa wrote about a range of themes and was a staunch opponent of social discrimination. Mr. Halappa said that, <i>Suladi, Ugabhoga </i>and <i>Mundige,</i> unique poetic experiments practised by Kanakadasa and other poems of the Haridasa tradition have enriched literature.</p>
      <p>K.S. Eshwarappa, Minister for Rural Development and Panchayat Raj, said the State government was committed to the development of Kaginele, the place associated with Kanakadasa and to popularise his work. R. Prasanna Kumar, MLC; K.B. Sivakumar, Deputy Commissioner, and K.M. Shantharaju, Superintendent of Police, were present.</p>
      <p>Kanaka Jayanti was observed at Kurubara Vidyarthi Nilaya, a hostel of the Kuruba community, and by Beereshwara Vikasa Samsthe at Navile in the city.</p>
      <p>At Jnanadeepa School in Javalli here, the students presented a dance-drama based on the life and achievements of Kanakadasa.</p>
