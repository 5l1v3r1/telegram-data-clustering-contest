      <h2>Wolverhampton Wanderers news | WWFC reporter Alex Dicken takes a look at how the 12 players currently on loan away from Molineux are getting on</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Dicken, https://www.facebook.com/alexdickenjournalist/?fref=ts</a></address>
      <p>Wolverhampton Wanderers have a catalogue of players out on loan.</p>
      <p>Beneath <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/nuno-espirito-santo">Nuno Espirito Santo's</a> first team squad is a dozen or so players who are either surplus to requirements or in need of senior minutes the Portuguese is unable to offer them at Molineux.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> have used the loan market successfully in recent seasons and they are hoping the host of players they’ve lent to other clubs this term reap the benefits.</p>
      <p>Here, we take a look at the fortunes of all the Wolves players currently out on loan:</p>
      <h4>Will Norris</h4>
      <p>There were plenty inside the confines of Compton Park who were questioning Norris’ move during the early weeks of the season after Paul Lambert kept him on Ipswich’s bench.</p>
      <p>Norris has started Ipswich’s last three matches with Lambert giving a slightly odd reason for replacing regular number one Tomas Holy.</p>
      <p>"I left Tomas out because I needed Will to feel under pressure to play a game and get used to it,” Lambert said. “Tomas had been playing excellent and Will is an excellent goalkeeper as well.”</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Lambert added: "The two of them are really good guys and good characters.</p>
      <p>"They both kick the ball an absolute mile and are really good shot savers, which is really important.</p>
      <p>"Tomas has the height advantage, Will has his advantages too and they are both really good."</p>
      <p>But it’s Norris who appears to have won Lambert’s heart, which will please Wolves no doubt.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>Roderick Miranda</h4>
      <p>While one ex-Wolves player, Pedro Goncalves, has played a starring role in newly-promoted Famalicao’s stunning start to the season, Miranda hasn’t.</p>
      <p>The defender, who was surprisingly part of Wolves’ tour of China in the summer, has only played three games and it’s been a bit of a nightmare.</p>
      <p>Miranda’s first start only lasted 16 minutes due to injury, while his most recent match for Famalicao saw him sent off after just 34 minutes.</p>

      <h4>Cameron John</h4>
      <p>Defender John is one of two players Wolves sent on loan to Doncaster over the summer.</p>
      <p>John, 20, made a bright start at the Keepmoat but picked up an ankle injury in training at the end of September, which is currently keeping him out of action. He’s been back at Wolves’ training base for treatment.</p>
      <p>Prior to the injury John was a regular in Doncaster’s line-up and scored twice in eight appearances in league and cup.</p>

      <h4>Ryan Giles</h4>
      <p>Giles is perhaps the fastest developing youngster on Wolves’ books. He really impressed Nuno last season and his latest loan move has brought new highs.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old has earned England under-20 call-ups while at Shrewsbury Town, where he’s working under ex-Wolves captain Sam Ricketts.</p>
      <p>He’s started 13 of Shrewsbury’s 16 League One matches this term and Wolves have been keeping a close eye on his progress.</p>
      <p>“I’ve spoken to a lot of the staff and they’ve been great,” said Giles. “The sports science are on top of my GPS, monitoring what I’ve been doing away from the club. Seyi (Olofinjana) and Sean (Parrish) have been down to watch, I’ve been in contact a lot with Wolves and they’ve been really good.</p>
      <p>"They’ve shown they’re keen to see how I’m getting on and not leave me to one side, which has been nice – they actually do care.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>Sadou Diallo</h4>
      <p>Diallo is also on loan in League One with Accrington Stanley but he’s only made two appearances. Diallo’s only league outing so far came off the bench against Sunderland, while he started and scored in Accrington’s EFL Trophy win over Oldham.</p>
      <h4>Connor Ronan</h4>
      <p>Irish midfielder Ronan was rewarded for an excellent loan spell with DAC 1904 Dunajská Streda with a new Wolves contract over the summer. And he’s picked up where he left off after returning to Slovakia.</p>
      <p>Ronan is a regular in Dunajská Streda’s midfield and has gained Europa League exposure this season, albeit just four matches as his team came unstuck in the second qualifying round against Atromitos.</p>
      <p>After a couple of unsuccessful loan spells at Portsmouth and Walsall in League One, Ronan, 21, is thriving once more.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>“I’m really enjoying it in Slovakia,” he says. “I think it’s really important for me at this stage of my career to be getting regular game time at club level.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t feel the need to change really as it went really well last season and the manager backs me so that’s really important for me.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>David Wang</h4>
      <p>It’s difficult to keep track of Wang’s exploits with Spanish fourth tier club Granollers.</p>
      <p>Granollers are sixth in Tercera Division Group Five and are targeting a place in the play-offs come the end of the season.</p>
      <p>But Wang - who remains ineligible for a work permit in the UK due to his Chinese passport - has barely played.</p>
      <p>“He has played, but only from the bench, and very few minutes,” journalist Jorge Abizanda told us.</p>

      <h4>Rafa Mir</h4>
      <p>Spanish striker Mir has only started one Championship game and it was perhaps Nottingham Forest’s most hapless performance this term.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old had little joy against Wigan Athletic and was hooked by Sabri Lamouchi after just 55 minutes of Forest’s 1-0 defeat.</p>
      <p>“It wouldn’t be a surprise if it’s a while before he starts another one again,” Sarah Clapson, the Nottingham Post’s Forest correspondent, tells us. “He didn’t have the best of games at Wigan.</p>
      <p>“He got into some decent positions and had a few chances, but just didn’t have the sharpness in front of goal.</p>
      <p>“That’s really been the story of his loan spell so far. He’s just not got going and has struggled to make an impact.”</p>
      <p>Mir has made two Carabao Cup starts for Forest but he remains goalless in 10 outings for his new club.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <h4>Niall Ennis</h4>
      <p>Similarly to Mir, Ennis has been by no means prolific at Doncaster Rovers - but he is getting the game time Wolves hoped he would.</p>
      <p>Ennis has started seven matches in League One with a further four appearances coming from the bench. The rookie striker has just one goal to his name, a scorching strike against Lincoln City which was nominated for August’s goal of the month.</p>
      <p>Doncaster boss Darren Moore is unsurprisingly a big fan. “He’s strong, he’s quick, he manages and manipulates the ball really well with it at his feet,” says Moore. “He gives the opposition defenders something to think about.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>Renat Dadashov</h4>
      <p>The summer capture of Azerbaijan international Dadashov raised eyebrows at Molineux and sporting director Kevin Thelwell reckons he will ‘develop into a fantastic footballer in the future’.</p>
      <p>Dadashov was immediately loaned out to Portuguese club Pacos De Ferreira and he’s made six appearances in the Primeira Liga, two of which have been starts.</p>
      <p>While the 20-year-old hasn’t scored in the league, he did net the winner in Pacos’ win over Louletano in the cup.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article16707365.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-826461858.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>Bright Enobakhare</h4>
      <p>After such a successful loan spell at Coventry City during the second half of last season it simply hasn’t happened for Enobakhare at Wigan.</p>
      <p>The attacker has started one Carabao Cup game and come off the bench twice in the Championship to little effect.</p>
      <p>Enobakhare has, however, been called up by Nigeria for this month’s under-23 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>Leo Bonatini</h4>
      <p>Bonatini secured a move to Vitoria Guimaraes and is playing regularly in Portugal’s top tier and the Europa League.</p>
      <p>The striker ended a 22-month wait for a league goal with an effort against Sporting recently. Bonatini followed that up with the fifth in Vitoria’s 5-0 thumping of Belenenses a few days later.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old’s career looked like it was unravelling last season, especially after his failed stint in the Championship with Nottingham Forest, but he appears to have found his feet once again.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>Others</h4>
      <p>Sylvan Deslandes and Jordan Graham joined Bulgarian club Lokomotiv Plovdiv but an administrative error meant they couldn’t be registered and they’ve both since returned to Compton Park.</p>
      <p>Graham, who is out of contract in the summer, has joined up with the under-23s since returning from Bulgaria.</p>
      <p>Helder Costa and Ivan Cavaleiro aren’t included on this list with their moves to Leeds United and Fulham respectively poised to become permanent next summer.</p>
