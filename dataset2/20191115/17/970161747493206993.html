      <p>A man who sent a ‘sickening’ death threat to Anna Soubry MP has been jailed.</p>
      <p>Alden Bryce Barlow, 55, was tracked down using finger print analysis and CCTV from the post office where he sent it.</p>
      <p>He wrote in a letter: ‘COX WAS FIRST YOU ARE NEXT’.</p>
      <p>Barlow, from Doncaster, admitted sending a letter conveying a threatening message and was sentenced to 12 months in jail at Sheffield Crown Court.</p>
      <p>He was also given a 10-year restraining order against Ms Soubry, who is standing as a candidate for The Independent Group for Change (TIGfC) in the General Election.</p>
      <p>The letter arrived at the MP’s constituency office in Broxtowe, Nottingham, on October 14 this year and was opened by a member of staff, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said.</p>

      <p>Chief Crown prosecutor Gerry Wareham called the note ‘sickening’ and ‘ominous’ and described it as an ‘attack on democracy’.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘Ms Soubry and her staff in the constituency office understandably found the message deeply disturbing and highly offensive.</p>
      <p>‘I hope the sentence Barlow received today is of some comfort to Ms Soubry and her colleagues and a deterrent to anyone else contemplating such despicable actions against a parliamentary representative or candidate.’</p>
      <p>Mrs Cox was Labour MP for Batley and Spen when she was stabbed and shot outside a constituency surgery in Birstall, West Yorkshire, in 2016.</p>
