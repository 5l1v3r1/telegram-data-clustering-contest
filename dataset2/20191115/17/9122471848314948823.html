      <h1>Alabama at Mississippi State: Game Time, Spread, Channel, Announcers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:58:08+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>Alabama suffered its first loss of the season last Saturday to LSU. It certainly hurts the program’s chances of making the <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/the-college-football-playoff-rankings-after-week-11-have-been-released">College Football Playoff</a>, but they could impress the selection committee with a couple of blowout wins toward the end of the year.</p>
      <p>Next up for the Crimson Tide is a showdown with the Mississippi State Bulldogs.</p>
      <p>The Crimson Tide haven’t lost back-to-back games since 2007, which means the Bulldogs could be in trouble this weekend. Nick Saban’s teams usually come out on fire after a loss.</p>
      <p>One issue for Alabama is that Tua Tagovailoa is still dealing with health issues. Despite putting up incredible numbers against LSU, the pain from his ankle injury hasn’t gone away just yet.</p>
      <p>Saban expects Tagovailoa to play on Saturday against the Bulldogs, but the team could limit his usage if they get out to a sizable lead.</p>

      <p>Here are the details for the Alabama-Mississippi State game:</p>
      <p><b>Game Time: </b>12:00 p.m. ET</p>
      <p><b>Channel: </b>ESPN</p>
      <p><b>Spread: </b>Alabama -17.5</p>
      <p><b>Over/Under: </b>61</p>
      <p><b>Announcers: </b>Steve Levy, Brian Griese, Todd McShay, Molly McGrath</p>
      <p>Mississippi State is coming off a blowout victory over Arkansas before having a bye last weekend. Head coach Joe Moorhead had two weeks to prepare his team for Alabama.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the extra time off will help Mississippi State stay within striking distance of Alabama, but <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/game/_/gameId/401110851">ESPN’s Football Power Index</a> only gives the Bulldogs a 12.8 percent chance of winning the game.</p>
      <p>Do you think Alabama will bounce back this weekend with a win?</p>
