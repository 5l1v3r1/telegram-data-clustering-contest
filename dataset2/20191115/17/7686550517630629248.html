        <b>WORLD CUP WINNER TIPS OSPREYS FOR CHAMPIONS CUP MELTDOWN</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rugby pundit Will Greenwood, a 2003 World Cup winner with England, has written off the chances of the Ospreys in the Heineken Champion Cup.</p>
      <p>Under-fire coach Allan Clarke and his charges kick-off their campaign against two-time winners Munster in Swansea on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Holders Saracens and 2018-19 finalists Racing 92 are also in Pool Four of the tournament.</p>
      <p>Ospreys have won just one of their six fixtures in this season's Guinness PRO14, hitting a low when they became the first team to lose at home to minnows Southern Kings.</p>
      <p>Writing in the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2019/11/15/will-greenwoods-predictions-champions-league-pool-stage-teams/">Telegraph</a> , Greenwood predicted: "Ospreys are doomed before it starts.</p>
      <p>"They have no chance in this group - in fact, in terms of the Welsh regions, only the Scarlets would seem to be able to compete in Europe and they are in the Challenge Cup this year."</p>
      <p>Ouch!</p>

        <b>SONNY BILL WILLIAMS TALKS ABOUT HIS WILD PAST</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sonny Bill Williams has opened up on his wild ways and how it left him with “emptiness in his heart”.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old New Zealand centre was unveiled as a Toronto Wolfpack player after a sensational switch to the new Super League rugby league club.</p>
      <p>The two-year deal, alleged to be worth £5m, made Williams the highest-paid rugby union and league player in history.</p>
      <p>In an interview with the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/50406738">BBC</a> , Williams admitted to being “at the other end of the spectrum” before converting to Islam while playing for French club Toulon 10 years ago.</p>
      <p>“Look, I chased girls. I drank alcohol, spent lavishly and thought I was someone that I wasn’t. I lived that life and, in my experience, what did it give me? Hollowness and emptiness in my heart,” Williams said.</p>
      <p>“It took a few years for the process, but I found Allah, I found Islam and it really allowed me to turn the wildness in myself into positivity.</p>
      <p>“With the way that I have driven as a sportsman to succeed, those two together have allowed me to reach where I am today.”</p>

        <b>TRIO MAKE THEIR FIRST STARTS FOR WALES WOMEN</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ospreys pair Robyn Lock and Niamh Terry and Cardiff Blues’ wing Rebekah O’Loughlin have been handed their first starts for Wales Women when they face Scotland in Glasgow on Sunday (kick-off 3pm).</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/inspirational-words-welsh-rugby-player-17202249">Lock, who has overcome stage four cancer,</a> and Terry made their Test debuts against Spain earlier this month while former tennis international O’Loughlin got her first cap in the last-minute win over Ireland last Sunday.</p>
      <p>Uncapped front-row forwards Molly Kelly and Sarah Lawrence are named on the bench as the coaching team continue to use the autumn series to develop strength in depth.</p>
      <p>“We’ve stuck with the theme of giving girls opportunities throughout this autumn, the three girls making their first start will be looking forward to that and we’ve also rewarded others for good performances against Ireland,” said acting coach Geraint Lewis.</p>
      <p>“We’re looking to build on that performance, keep working hard and get better at the basics.</p>
      <p>“It’s always tough against Scotland, especially at their home. They will be passionate and hard-working but we can take confidence from last week and if we can replicate our effort and commitment, we will give ourselves a good chance to be in the game.</p>

      <p>“International rugby is about small margins, and it would be good to come out on the right side again.</p>
      <p>“We want to build on the skill elements that were very encouraging against Ireland.</p>
      <p>“From a forwards point of view, Robyn has made an impact off the bench in the last two games. She’s got an opportunity now to show us what she’s about from the start this time.</p>
      <p>“We are blessed with competition in the back-row and hopefully this trio can impose their game on the back of the excellent work the front-five has been doing.”</p>

        <b>SPRINGBOK ACE REJECTS JEREMY GUSCOTT'S 'BOMB SQUAD' CALL</b>
      </p>
      <p>A former Springboks skipper has questioned whether calls to cut the number of substitutes used in a match is because South Africa were so good with their bench strategy in winning a third Rugby World Cup.</p>
      <p>Former England and Lions great Jeremy Guscott had made the proposal in the wake of the Springboks using their bench to maximum effect in the final with England.</p>
      <p>But Corne Krige said South Africa merely utilised current laws currently in place when coach Rassie Erasmus introduced his so-called ‘bomb squad’ into the fray.</p>

        <b>WRU HOLD TALKS WITH WARREN GATLAND OVER DOPING SUSPICION COMMENTS</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Welsh Rugby Union have spoken with former Wales boss Warren Gatland to fully understand the <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/warren-gatland-wales-doping-suspicion-17254270">comments he made around doping suspicions</a> this week.</p>
      <p>The Kiwi revealed he may have had suspicions about a Wales player doping during his 12-year reign as national head coach based on jokes made by teammates, but later clarified he had no evidence to base any suspicion on.</p>

        <b>THE WALES PLAYER WHO EQUALLED A RECORD AT THE WORLD CUP</b>
      </p>
      <p>Josh Adams was the centre of attention as he broke the record of Shane Williams for the most tries scored by a Wales player at a Rugby World Cup when he dived over for his seventh of the tournament.</p>
      <p>But the feat of another Welsh player slipped under the radar as he equalled a world record when coming on as a substitute during the 40-17 defeat to New Zealand in the third place play-off in Tokyo for the bronze medal.</p>
