      <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The House Intelligence Committee’s only Republican woman was gaveled down within minutes of the start of the House impeachment hearing.</p>
      <p>And New York Rep. Elise Stefanik stayed in the spotlight for pretty much the rest of the day Friday.</p>
      <p>The 35-year-old Harvard graduate has slowly increased her visibility in Congress. That includes recruiting women to run as GOP candidates.</p>
      <p>Republicans featured her prominently Friday as former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch testified to the panel. The committee is holding hearings on whether President Donald Trump should be impeached.</p>
      <p>Republicans say she knows the issue. But they’re also aware it helped to showcase a woman as they grilled the ambassador.</p>
      <p>Though her interruptions broke committee rules, the outburst allowed Republicans to accuse Democrats of treating a woman lawmaker unfairly.</p>
