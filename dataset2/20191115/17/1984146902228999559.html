      <h2>Save Newcastle Wildlife has lodged a claim for judicial review against Newcastle City Council's approval of 1,200 homes and two new schools on the giant development site</h2>

      <p>Wildlife campaigners fighting against the building of 1,200 more homes at the Newcastle Great Park will take their battle to the High Court.</p>
      <p>Save Newcastle Wildlife has confirmed that it has lodged a claim for judicial review against council chiefs’ decision to approve the next phase of construction on the controversial development site, in a bid to protect species in the Green Belt and nearby Havannah Nature Reserve.</p>
      <p>Newcastle City Council says the move will “inevitably delay the provision of much needed family housing and two schools”.</p>
      <p>But the campaigners insist that there is nothing to stop developers making an application to build the proposed primary and secondary schools, to which Save Newcastle Wildlife is not opposed, while the row over the new homes rumbles on.</p>

      <p>After successfully <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/save-newcastle-wildlife-great-park-17167449">raising the £3,000 necessary</a> to pay for initial legal costs in just two weeks, Save Newcastle Wildlife’s Rachel Locke said: “We would like to thank everyone who has kindly donated and actively spread the word.</p>
      <p>“Growing concern around what has been allowed to happen in Newcastle Great Park, at the expense of our natural environment and local residents, is reflected in people's generosity.</p>
      <p>“The claim has now been lodged at Court and served to Newcastle City Council and Newcastle Great Park Consortium.</p>
      <p>“We are continuing to raise funds for ongoing legal costs, which will increase again when the case is heard at Court.</p>
      <p>“In the meantime, there is nothing stopping the developer from submitting an application for the schools, which avoids encroachment on the Green Belt and minimises harm to wildlife.</p>
      <p>“This could be determined relatively quickly, given that the proposal would accord with the local plan and would not have any legal implications.”</p>
      <p>It was revealed earlier this month that the opening of the proposed primary school could now be pushed back to September 2022.</p>
      <p>A council spokesperson said: “It is disappointing that Save Newcastle Wildlife have felt the need to take this step.</p>
      <p>“We have worked hard to ensure that the planning decision was carefully and properly considered and have consulted fully throughout the application.</p>
      <p>“The delay in going through this process will inevitably delay the provision of much needed family housing and two schools for the area.”</p>

      <p>The developers behind the huge Great Park development have also complained about the latest setback to their plans, which took 10 months to be formally approved after coming before councillors last December for a decision.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Taylor Wimpey North East said: “The challenge to the outline planning permission, which includes the schools, can only delay the delivery of essential education provision and based on all the positive work completed around biodiversity it is disappointing that a challenge has been lodged. We will endeavour to continue with the plan as approved to deliver the agreed community facilities.”</p>
      <p>A Persimmon Homes spokesman added: “We are aware that Save Newcastle Wildlife has now lodged its challenge in the court and we are disappointed by this. We are reviewing the papers and intend to contend this.</p>
      <p>“Our planning permission is the product of working closely with the Council and all stakeholders for many years. We are acutely aware how desperate the local community is for the new schools to be built and this planning permission paves the way for these to be delivered when they are needed in 2021.</p>
      <p>"The intention remains for the new first school to be open in September of that year.</p>
      <p>"However, should this legal action continue it will inevitably lead to a delay in delivery of the new schools and services as they are secured by the very planning permission being challenged.”</p>
