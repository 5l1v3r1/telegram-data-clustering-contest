      <h2>IBC’s aim is time-bound resolution: RP</h2>

      <p>The Supreme Court’s decision in the Essar Steel case sets a precedent for other cases under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).</p>
      <p>While striking down the NCLAT order, the court approved ArcelorMittal’s resolution plan submitted on October 23, 2018, and upheld the overriding status of financial creditors vis-à-vis the operational creditors.</p>
      <p>“Challenges faced during the resolution process included managing various stakeholder, improving operations and litigations in different forums,” Satish Kumar Gupta, the resolution professional for Essar Steel, told <i>The Hindu. </i>“Essar Steel achieved its highest ever production and EBITDA during the CIRP. Approval of plan enhances confidence of stakeholders and investors in the IBC process.”</p>
      <p>Mrutyunjay Mahapatra, MD &amp; CEO of Syndicate Bank, said “The decision will help in time-bound resolution of other NCLT cases, which is the aim of the IBC. Financial creditors were awaiting the judgment; now, the rules are clear. Operational creditors can claim rights in case of liquidation.”</p>
