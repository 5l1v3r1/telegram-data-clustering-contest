      <h2>Alfie Perkins has shared pictures of his injuries after a speeding car failed to stop at a red light in Manchester city centre earlier this month</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:13:03+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:13</time> by <a rel="author">Aaron Flanagan, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/aaron-flanagan/</a></address>
      <p>A young man who trolled <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> footballer <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jack-grealish">Jack Grealish</a> over his dead baby brother has been left with a fractured skull after being hit by a car.</p>
      <p>Alfie Perkins, 19, has shared photographs of his bloodied face and scarred body following the attack.</p>
      <p>It came two weeks after Perkins avoided a jail sentence for posting vile messages on social media to Grealish about his brother Keelan.</p>
      <p>Perkins claims that a driver failed to stop at a red light while driving at speed and hit him in Manchester city centre on November 2.</p>
      <p>Writing on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> , Perkins said: "Life comes at you nearly as fast as speeding cars that don't stop on red lights do".</p>

      <p>He added: "Didn't think it was possible for me to get any uglier but here we are with my face drooping to the right and the left side of it not working, you not reckon it's time I caught a break".</p>
      <p>But Perkins believes that the incident was not "karma" after that was suggested by another Twitter user.</p>
      <p>Perkins replied: "Leg it bruv, karma for laughing at somebody being dead is not fracturing your skull in two places hahaha."</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Perkins chugged nine pints of lager before watching Birmingham City vs Aston Villa, the Second City derby, following which he tweeted Grealish three horrific messages.</p>

      <p>Grealish had just scored the winning goal in the game where he was also attacked by a rival fan on the pitch.</p>
      <p>On one tweet, Perkins included a picture of Keelan's gravestone.</p>
      <p>He tweeted: “He may have scored but will never bring his dead brother back and that brings me more satisfaction than anything else ever could.”</p>

      <p>“Grealish went down quicker than his brother got lowered into the grave. Where’s your brother gone? Come on!”</p>
      <p>Keelan fell victim to cot death in April 2000, aged just nine months old. Grealish was aged four at the time.</p>
      <p>Perkins, an accountancy and finance student, was ordered to pay a fine and was seen smirking outside of court following the trial.</p>

      <p>When questioned about his smiles outside of court, Perkins tweeted: “I regret all of it but she says this like nobody would be smiling after being faced with the prospect of prison and the end result being only having to pay £350. Wallop.”</p>
      <p>Perkins denied the charges against him and claimed that he was encouraged to post the tweets by those with him at the game.</p>
