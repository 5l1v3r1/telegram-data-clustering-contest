      <p>MADISON, Wis. - Investigators were able to use DNA to arrest a suspect in an attempted homicide investigation from October, according to Madison police. </p>
      <p>The Madison Police Department said 32-year-old Donald D. Lewis was arrested Thursday in connection with a shooting outside an east Madison bar on Oct. 26. </p>
      <p>According to the report, police responded to a report of shots fired in the 1500 block of North Stoughton Road near Club LaMark at about 12:45 a.m. About 15 minutes later, a 36-year-old man arrived at a local hospital with a non-life-threatening gunshot wound. He told police he was shot outside Club LaMark and a friend drove him to the hospital. </p>
      <p>Police said detectives were able to obtain DNA from the shooting scene and match it to Lewis. </p>
      <p>Lewis was taken into custody Thursday at a convenience store on Milwaukee Street, officials said. He had a handgun in a pocket at the time of his arrest. A second handgun was seized from his Dutch Mill Road home after a search warrant was served, police said.</p>
      <p>Lewis is facing a tentative charge of attempted first-degree intentional homicide related to the shooting.</p>
