      <p>There are just days to go now until this year's I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here! is back on our screens.</p>
      <p>The rumour mill had been in overdrive as speculation mounted about who would be heading Down Under for this year's show - set to be made even better <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/ant-mcpartlin-confirmed-im-celebrity-14124866">with the jungle reunion of Ant and Dec</a> .</p>
      <p>From soap stars to sports stars, a whole host of different celebrities had seen their names linked with a stint on <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> , all hoping to follow in the footsteps of 2018 winner Harry Redknapp.</p>
      <p>And on Sunday night, we will see the confirmed <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/im-a-celebrity-lineup-confirmed-16118148">I'm A Celebrity lineup</a> head into the jungle to take on everything life in there throws at them.</p>
      <p>And, as well as Girls Aloud star Nadine Coyle and football legend Ian Wright, one of the campmates this year is Andrew Maxwell.</p>
      <h3>Who is Andrew Maxwell?</h3>
      <p>The Irish comedian has a very successful stand up and TV career. And as well as appearing on screen in full view of everyone, the 44-year-old is also known as the voice over guy for hit MTV series Ex on the Beach.</p>
      <p>He first started performing in 1992 and went on to find success in the industry by booking warm-up slots at gigs across the country.</p>

      <p>He has since appeared on a string of popular panel shows, including QI, Never Mind the Buzzcocks, Mock The Week, Breaking The News and Comedy Central's Roast Battle.</p>
      <p>Speaking about his phobias, Andrew said: "I don't like the look of any of those guys - the insects and creepy crawlies!"</p>
