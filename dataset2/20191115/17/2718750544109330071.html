        <i>Ford v Ferrari</i>
      </h4>
      <p>As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfAqtFuGjWM">Charli XCX</a> once said, vroom vroom! The thrilling race sequences in <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/ford-v-ferrari-movie-review-an-old-fashioned-rouser.html">James Mangold’s ’60s automotive drama</a> are earning <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ford_v_ferrari/reviews?type=top_critics">cheers</a> even from critics who don’t self-identify as car guys, which should help<i> Ford v Ferrari </i>place strong in the craft categories. If audiences get onboard (the movie’s <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/box-office-ford-v-ferrari-has-inside-track-charlies-angels-1254643">projected to lead the weekend box office</a>, albeit with only $20 million), there could be reason for optimism: I’m reminded of <i>The Martian</i>, a similarly skillful mainstream effort that proved an all-around contender a few years back. With <i>The Irishman</i>, <i>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</i>, and <i>1917</i>, the dad-movie lane in this year’s Best Picture race is awfully crowded, but with an Academy that remains <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/new-academy-members-2019-revealed-full-list-1221972">68 percent male</a>, there may be room on the track for everyone.</p>

        <i>Cats</i>
      </h4>
      <p>The perils of digital fur technology: Last week <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2019/11/cats-miss-awards-deadlines-holiday-release-oscars-1202188369/">Anne Thompson</a> reported that <i>Cats</i> may not be ready to screen until mid-December, which would blow it past the cutoff dates for the New York Film Critics Circle (fine), the National Board of Review (hmm), SAG (uh-oh), and the Golden Globes (gasp!). However, the well-connected <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/oscars-preview-sag-awards-golden-globes-critics-choice-awards-analysis-news-1202784579/">Pete Hammond</a> notes that Universal is still planning to give the musical “a big push for Globes love,” so you have to figure the studio will do everything in its power — up to and including training Taylor Swift and Jason Derulo in AfterEffects — to make that deadline.</p>

      <h4>James Mangold, <i>Ford v Ferrari</i></h4>
      <p>“There’s no defense against Mangold’s hyperkinetic style, but, fortunately, there doesn’t need to be,” our own <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/ford-v-ferrari-movie-review-an-old-fashioned-rouser.html">David Edelstein</a> writes of the filmmaker’s work in <i>Ford v Ferrari.</i> The directors’ branch will surely appreciate Mangold’s technical prowess in the racing scenes, as well as the film’s central metaphor (it turns out to be a parable about the possibility of making great art under capitalism), though I think <i>FvF</i> will have to raise its profile in the Best Picture race before he can start gaining traction here.</p>

      <h4>Todd Haynes, <i>Dark Waters</i></h4>
      <p>Why has Todd Haynes, poster child for indie auteurs, made what looks like a bog-standard whistle-blower flick? As producer-star Mark Ruffalo explained at a recent industry screening, he brought the <i>Carol</i> director aboard to make this environmental docudrama a little less standard. Haynes does an admirable job bringing his unique sense of texture to the film’s Cincinnati setting, but with the embargo lifting this week, reviews are <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2019/11/dark-waters-review-mark-ruffalo-todd-haynes-1202189292/">decidedly</a> <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/dark-waters-review-1254524?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">mixed</a>.</p>

      <h4>Christian Bale, <i>Ford v Ferrari</i></h4>
      <p>As persnickety race-car driver Ken Miles, Bale finally gets to speak in <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/ford-v-ferrari-christian-bale-talks-in-his-real-voice.html">something close to his real voice</a> onscreen, and critics are charmed. “Bale is a cussed and calculating actor, yet he’s never been more likable than he is here — an irony to relish, since the character he plays makes so little effort to be liked,” writes <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/11/18/boys-will-be-boys-in-ford-v-ferrari">Anthony Lane</a>. Will his progress in the packed Best Actor race be a bellwether for the film’s own chances, or is <i>Ford v Ferrari</i> enough of a technical marvel to score a Best Picture nomination without a corresponding acting nod?</p>

      <h4>Mark Ruffalo, <i>Dark Waters</i></h4>
      <p>Ruffalo de-glams himself as a dogged environmental lawyer in <i>Dark Waters</i>, and <a href="https://ew.com/movie-reviews/2019/11/13/dark-waters-mark-ruffalo-review/?utm_content=link&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=entertainmentweekly_ew&amp;utm_term=378099B0-0661-11EA-A15B-39954744363C">Leah Greenblatt</a> notes he “leads with a sort of unflagging anti-charisma, his chin thrust forward in a perpetual bulldog frown and his hair plastered into a corporate-dad side part.” The film’s campaign has been playing up the movie’s political resonance, a set of talking points firmly in Ruffalo’s environmentalist comfort zone, though this kind of role has been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVhlJNJopOQ">spoofed so many times</a> I wonder how his straight interpretation will be able to catch on.</p>

Bradley Cooper’s sitdown with the NYT’s star profiler was <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/02/oscars-2019-why-star-is-born-is-getting-snubbed.html">widely credited with derailing his campaign</a> last year, but Hanks can probably sleep soundly: Much like <a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a27134/can-you-say-hero-esq1198/">the <i>Esquire</i> story</a> <i>Beautiful Day </i>is based on, the piece is all about how the actor is every inch the swell guy he appears.</p>

      <h4>Sterling K. Brown, <i>Waves</i></h4>
      <p>Trey Edward Shults’s family melodrama has been on a fittingly oscillating journey this season: a Telluride reaction effusive enough to earn <a href="https://www.theringer.com/movies/2019/9/3/20847253/waves-trey-edward-shults-sterling-k-brown-lucas-hedges-krisha-it-comes-at-night"><i>American Graffiti </i>comparisons</a>, followed almost immediately by a more measured response at TIFF. Youngsters Kelvin Harrison Jr. and Taylor Russell are the two breakouts, but it’s Brown as their martinet father who has the type of teeth-baring role voters love to rally around. Though <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/movies/waves-review.html">Manohla Dargis</a> notes the actor’s big character-defining speech “sounds as if it might have been written for the benefit of white viewers,” she calls Brown “an intensely empathetic performer [who] fills these words up with feeling.”</p>

On the bright side, critics seem to be enjoying her transformation into the California senator, with <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-reviews/the-report-movie-review-adam-driver-910695/">Peter Travers</a> hailing Bening as “magnificent.”</p>
