      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:55:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:55</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>Wall Street's main indexes hit fresh record highs on Friday, as optimism related to U.S.-China trade talks and solid earnings from semiconductor industry bellwether Applied Materials boosted risk appetite.</p>
      <p>Shares in Applied Materials Inc jumped 9.3% and pushed the Philadelphia Semiconductor index  to an all-time high after the chip gear maker forecast first-quarter results above estimates.</p>
      <p>Nine of the 11 major S&amp;P 500 sectors were higher. Healthcare shares gained 1.3% and provided the biggest boost followed by the trade-sensitive technology sector, which rose 0.65%.</p>
      <p>White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said late on Thursday that the world's two largest economies were getting close to a trade agreement, citing what he called very constructive talks with Beijing.</p>
      <p>Adding to the upbeat mood, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said there would be a call between U.S. and Chinese officials later on Friday.</p>
      <p>"We are definitely headed in the right direction with regard to trade," said Keith Buchanan, portfolio manager at GlobAlt in Atlanta.</p>
      <p>"Although there was some skittishness ... the equity market hasn't shown much of a pull back and we are still making those highs."</p>
      <p>Wall Street's main indexes have been powered recently by hopes of a trade deal, largely better-than-expected third-quarter earnings and a third interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve.</p>
      <p>The benchmark S&amp;P 500 index was on course to post its sixth weekly percentage rise.</p>
      <p>Data showed U.S. retail sales rebounded in October, but consumers cut back on purchases of big-ticket household items and clothing, which could temper expectations for a strong holiday shopping season.</p>
      <p>The report comes a day after the benchmark S&amp;P hit an all-time closing high after retail giant Walmart Inc's robust earnings.</p>
      <p>At 12:33 p.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 149.99 points, or 0.54%, at 27,931.95, the S&amp;P 500 &lt;.SPX&gt; was up 17.36 points, or 0.56%, at 3,113.99 and the Nasdaq Composite  was up 49.83 points, or 0.59%, at 8,528.84.</p>
      <p>Qualcomm Inc gained 1.1% after Mizuho upgraded its rating on the stock to "buy" from "neutral", while JP Morgan raised its price target.</p>
      <p>But Nvidia Corp fell 2.3% as the company said it expects its gaming chip business to be impacted by seasonal weakness in the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2.00-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.69-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.</p>
      <p>The S&amp;P index recorded 46 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 96 new highs and 84 new lows.</p>
