      <p>“It’s very sad. She was a big part of '<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/candace-cameron-bure-posts-emotional-instagram-story-about-end-of-fuller-house-in-tears-all-morning">Fuller House</a>.' She wasn’t in every episode, but her presence was definitely felt. We loved every single time she came on the set. So we have definitely felt her absence this season,” Barber, 43, said during an appearance on Us Magazine’s “<a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/andrea-barber-on-divorce-depression-and-the-end-of-fuller-house/">Watch With Us</a>” podcast.</p>
      <p>“We wish it wasn’t that way, and we wish she could be here because it definitely feels like there’s a hole in our hearts and a hole on our set,” Barber said. “But we understand that this is the decision that was made, and we respect it. But she’s always in our hearts forever. Every time we step on stage, she’s in our hearts.”</p>

      <p>Loughlin, 55, was fired from “Fuller House” and the Hallmark series “When Calls the Heart” in March following the discovery of her role in the still-unfolding national <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/college-admissions-scandal">college admissions scandal</a>.</p>
      <p>The Justice Department announced in October that Loughlin and her husband, along with nine other parents, were <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/lori-loughlin-mossimo-giannulli-new-charges-college-admissions-scandal">indicted on additional federal charges related to bribery</a>. A grand jury in Boston indicted them on charges of trying to bribe officials at an organization that receives at least $10,000 in federal funding.</p>
