      <p>During an interview with CNN on Friday, Representative Eric Swalwell (D-CA) stated that President Trump’s tweet about former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch “should be considered” as a new article of impeachment against President Trump.</p>
      <p>Host Anderson Cooper asked, “You think this should be added, potentially, to articles of impeachment?”</p>
      <p>Swalwell said, “It should be considered. Because there’s strong evidence of intimidation.”</p>
