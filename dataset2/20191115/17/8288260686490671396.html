      <p>Byrne, 49, of Tamworth, received a three-and-a-half year jail sentence and was banned from driving for three years following the crash.</p>
      <p>Now, Lee's devastated nephew, Jack Marlow, has kicked off a petition, calling for better safety measures to be installed at the junction - <a href="https://www.change.org/p/walsall-traffic-lights/dashboard?just_created=true">you can sign it here.</a></p>
      <p>Speaking to Black Country Live, he said: "I just want the time on the traffic lights to be delayed as they change too quickly and don't allow enough time for cars to get over.</p>
      <p>"There have been too many accidents. I have spoken to the council and I'm not happy about the outcome. If the traffic lights had a longer delay there would be enough time for cars to get over. It would decrease the amount of accidents."</p>
