      <h1>Man jailed for crash which left friend in "vegetative state"</h1>

        <b>A man whose dangerous driving caused a crash that left his friend in a "vegetative state" has been jailed for three years and four months.</b>
      </p>
      <p>John Dowling - of Ros Airgih, Liscarra, Carrick on Shannon in Co Leitrim - had been drinking at his 21st birthday when he got behind the wheel.</p>
      <p>Dowling was speeding and over the drink-driving limit when he tried to overtake a car while driving home on August 19th 2017.</p>
      <p>He lost control of the car at Drynam Road, Swords in Dublin after hitting a kerb and smashed into a tree and wall.</p>
      <p>The passenger side of the car, where his friend Mark Kelly was sitting, took most of the impact.</p>
      <p>Mark suffered what were described in court as "devastating injuries".</p>
      <p>He has not regained consciousness since and remains in a vegetative state.</p>
      <p>Dowling, who is now aged 23, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving causing serious harm.</p>
      <p>Judge Martin Nolan described it as a "tragic case" and noted Mark's family have been devastated by what happened and blamed Dowling for his actions.</p>
      <p>He said he had no doubt he was remorseful - but had to take account of the fact he was speeding, over the limit and driving without insurance.</p>
      <p>He said he knew it was a "serious misjudgement" but a custodial sentence was unavoidable.</p>
      <p>Taking everything into account, he then sentenced him to 40 months in prison.</p>
