      <p>Don’t come for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/katie-price/">Katie Price</a> and her kids if you’re not ready for some backlash.</p>
      <p>It all started when <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/peter-andre/">Peter Andre</a> took to Instagram last night to share a video of him playing a game with his daughter, Princess.</p>
      <p>Peter’s 14-year-old son, Junior, was dancing and playing music in the background to add to the suspense.</p>
      <p>‘Faster, faster!’ Peter lovingly called out to his daughter, as they throw an egg back and forth at each other.</p>
      <p>One strategic throw from Princess causes the egg to fall into Peter’s hand but then roll out and down his arm.</p>

      <p>It’s truly a sweet family moment… until one online troll had to have their say.</p>
      <p>They wrote in the comments section: ‘Junior is always bopping around, so funny! Nice to see what real families do and not what Katie does which is use her kids to make the headlines! Sorry but had to be said.’</p>
      <p>Then Junior shot back: ‘u don’t need to post negative stuff bout my mum.’</p>
      <p>The exchange with the troll didn’t seem to impress Peter, who quickly turned off the comments section to deescalate the situation.</p>

      <p>Peter Andre recently said <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/23/peter-andre-admits-kids-katie-price-best-thing-come-im-celebrity-10966745/">having kids with Katie Price was the best thing to come out appearing on I’m A Celebrity together</a>.</p>
      <p>Back in 2004, Peter, 46, met and fell in love with Katie, 41, during the third series of the hit ITV show.</p>
      <p>The pair went on to marry before having children Junior, 14, and Princess, 12, before divorcing in 2009.</p>
      <p>While his relationship with Katie has been strained since their split, Peter is proud that their kids came from their whirlwind romance on the series.</p>

      <p>Peter said going on the show was absolutely worth it.</p>
      <p>‘It did change my life,’ he said. ‘Do you know my two children, my two eldest are the only ever to come from that show?’</p>
