      <h2>Power Grid Corporation wants to dig both sides for laying underground cables</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:41:47+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:41</time> by <a rel="author">Special Correspondent</a></address>
      <p>The Kerala High Court with an interim order on Friday stopped the Power Grid Corporation of India from digging the newly tarred road at Kuthiran till further order.</p>
      <p>The repair and tar-topping of the Pattikkad-Kuthiran stretch of NH 544 was completed a few days ago after months of protests and legal fights by people against the contract company and the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI).</p>
      <p>To the shock of the people who had heaved a sigh of relief following the repair work, the Power Grid Corporation wants to dig both sides of the road for laying underground cables.</p>
      <p>During the hearing of the case at the High Court, DCC general secretary Shaji J. Kodankandath said the pothole-riddled stretch, which claimed many lives, had been repaired just a few days ago. As the Sabarimala season began, the rush on the road would increase tremendously, he stated. It was estimated that around 45,000 vehicles would pass though the road in a day during the season.</p>
      <p>The Power Grid Corporation signed the contract with the NHAI for laying the underground cables many months ago. According to the plan at that time, the work on the twin tunnels was to be completed and the traffic diverted through the tunnels by the time the Power Grip Corporation had to dig the road. But the work on the tunnel road was postponed indefinitely, destabilising the plan of the corporation.</p>
      <h3>28-km stretch</h3>
      <p>The corporation is laying the underground cable as part of the 320-KV HVDCV project to take 2,000 MW power from Pugalur in Tamil Nadu to Madakkathara. Cables are to go through the 28-km stretch from Wadakkanchery to Madakkathara, of the 150-km line.</p>
      <h3>Protests begin</h3>
      <p>The local people and Kuthiran Prathishedha Koottayma have already begun protests. They said they would not allow to dig the road further. Even District Collector S. Shanavas said the digging up of the tar-topped road could not be allowed.</p>
      <p>The people had already suffered a lot. The tarring was done with much difficulty. And the Sabarimala season would increase the rush though the route further. â€œEfforts are on to do the work of the Power Grid Corporation without digging the tar-topped road. We have to discuss the issue with the District Collectors of Ernakulam, Coimbatore, and Palakkad, besides Ministers and Secretaries of Power and Public Works Department, he said.</p>
