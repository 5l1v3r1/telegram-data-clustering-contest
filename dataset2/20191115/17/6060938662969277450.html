      <h1>Nadal sweats on semis spot at ATP Finals after beating Tsitsipas</h1>

      <p>LONDON: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Rafael-Nadal">Rafael Nadal</a> recovered to beat <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Stefanos-Tsitsipas">Stefanos Tsitsipas</a> 6-7 (4/7), 6-4, 7-5 on Friday but faces an anxious wait to find out whether he will qualify for the last four at the ATP Finals.</p>
      <p>The Spanish top seed is pinning his hopes on <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Daniil-Medvedev">Daniil Medvedev</a> beating defending champion Alexander Zverev in the evening match in Group Andre Agassi in London.</p>
      <p>Nadal, who has already secured the year-end number one ranking, has never won the end-of-season tournament and had a miserable start at <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/the-O2-Arena">the O2 Arena</a>, being outplayed by Germany's Zverev.</p>
      <p>But the 19-time Grand Slam champion produced an astonishing comeback to defeat Medvedev, the Russian fourth seed, on Wednesday and give himself a chance of qualifying from the round-robin phase.</p>
      <p>Tsitsipas, 21, had already qualified for the semi-finals before Friday's match after beating Medvedev and Zverev.</p>
      <p>Serve dominated in the first set on Friday, with neither Nadal nor Tsitsipas facing a break point as the match drifted inexorably towards a tie-break.</p>
      <p>The Greek sixth seed came out on top, hammering an ace on his first match point to seal the set.</p>
      <p>The second set followed a similar pattern until the fifth game, when a Tsitsipas double-fault handed Nadal two break points -- the first of the match.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard could not capitalise but he upped the pressure in Tsitsipas's next serve game and earned another break point, which the Greek again survived.</p>
      <p>But Nadal earned a fourth break point in Tsitsipas's next service game and this time the Greek player slapped a regulation forehand wide and Nadal went on to level the match.</p>
      <p>A pumped-up Nadal maintained his momentum in the early stages of the deciding set, putting consistent pressure on his opponent's serve but he failed to convert a clutch of break points.</p>
      <p>Nadal earned two more break points in the 11th game and this time made it count as Tsitsipas put a backhand wide and he served out to win the match.</p>
      <p>Nadal's efforts will count for nothing unless Medvedev beats Zverev in the later match at the O2 Arena. A win for the German would send Nadal home.</p>
      <p>If Medvedev, who cannot progress, beats Zverev, Nadal would face a mouthwatering match against <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Roger-Federer">Roger Federer</a>.</p>
      <p>Six-time champion Federer, who was in Group Bjorn Borg, secured a spot in the semi-finals for the 16th time in his career on Thursday by beating <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Novak-Djokovic">Novak Djokovic</a> in straight sets.</p>
      <p>Austrian fifth seed <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Dominic-Thiem">Dominic Thiem</a> also qualified for Saturday's semi-finals.</p>
