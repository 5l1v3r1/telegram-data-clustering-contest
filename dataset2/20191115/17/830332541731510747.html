      <p>(CNN) - The NFL has suspended Cleveland Browns defensive end Myles Garrett without pay indefinitely -- and at least for the rest of the season -- for Thursday night's brawl in which he clocked an opponent in the head with a helmet, the NFL <a href="https://twitter.com/NFLfootballinfo/status/1195383502113509378">said Friday</a>.</p>
      <p>Two other players also have been suspended without pay for their role in the fight: Pittsburgh's Maurkice Pouncey (three games) and Cleveland's Larry Ogunjobi (one game).</p>
      <p>Garrett's minimum suspension puts him out for six regular season games and any playoff games this year -- one of the longest suspensions for on-field incidents in NFL history.</p>
      <p>Also, both teams have been fined $250,000 each.</p>
      <p>The brawl came at the end of the Browns' 21-7 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers.</p>
      <p>Garrett ripped off Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph's helmet and hit him in the head with it, sparking a fight that descended into chaos as players from both sides spilled onto the field.</p>
      <p>The NFL will be issuing additional discipline for other players in the coming days. All suspensions may be appealed under the collective bargaining agreement.</p>
