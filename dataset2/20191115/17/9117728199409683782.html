          <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/red-bull-racing">Red Bull</a> team principal Christian Horner has said that <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/max-verstappen">Max Verstappen</a>’s comments on <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/scuderia-ferrari">Ferrari</a> cheating with their engine are “played with a little” between translations from different languages.</b>

      <p>At the United States Grand Prix <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lewis-hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> claimed his sixth World Championship while <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mercedes-amg-f1-team">Mercedes</a> teammate <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/valtteri-bottas">Valtteri Bottas</a> took the win, but the lack of pace from Ferrari was surprising.<br/> <br/>Verstappen comments after the race were that Ferrari had been cheating with their power unit and the reason they weren’t as fast was due to the FIA’s release of technical directives changing their system.<br/> <br/><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/sebastian-vettel">Sebastian Vettel</a> recently said the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/news/50103/vettel-brands-verstappen-s-ferrari-cheating-comments-as-immature-.html">Dutchman’s comment were “immature”</a> but Horner believes there was some manipulation from the media.</p>
      <p><i>“I think Max’s comments were taken…perhaps…by the time you had translated from Dutch to German to English sometimes [the quotes] they get played with a little,” </i>Horner told <i>Sky Sports F1.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“Being such a competitive business and complicated business, teams are continually asking questions of the technical delegate.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Questioning what is a fair interpretation of the regulations in terms of what is legal and what isn’t. That happens on the chassis side and on the engine side.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>With the release of technical clarifications from the FIA in Austin the Red Bull boss revealed that there have been and may be more in Brazil.</p>
      <p><i>“Of course, there was a few clarifications that came out over the Austin weekend, a few more yesterday and maybe a few more this weekend,” </i>he added.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“It just shows the FIA are really policing what is a very complicated power unit with great scrutiny.”</i>
