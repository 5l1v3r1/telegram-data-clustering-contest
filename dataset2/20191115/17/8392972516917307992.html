      <p>Kelvin Fletcher is going to win <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/strictly-come-dancing/">Strictly Come Dancing</a>, if bookmakers are to be believed.</p>
      <p>According to bookies Odds Monkey, the former <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/">Emmerdale</a> star is unbeatable.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Ever since he <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/tv/strictly-fans-need-a-cold-shower-after-kelvin-fletchers-first-dance/">performed the Samba with professional partner Oti Mabuse in week one</a>, he's been one to watch - consistently getting high scores and great praise from the judges.</p>
      <p>Can anybody beat Kelvin Fletcher?</p>
      <aside>Kelvin's dominance continues and bookmakers are still seeing money for him, the public clearly love him.</aside>
      <p>The actor, 35, has been favourite to win the BBC dance show ever since his first performance, and nobody has led in the bookies chart from first to last in the history of the show.</p>

      </p>
      <p>But the former Emmerdale star, who only got asked on the show when <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/tv/entertainment/strictly-come-dancing/strictly-come-dancing-2019-jamie-laing-quit-foot-injury-bbc/">Made in Chelsea star Jamie Laing was forced to pull out because of injury</a>, has been producing stunning performances throughout.</p>
      <p>Nobody has been favourite from the first show to last, but that looks like it could be happening in 2019.</p>
      <p>As the show <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/tv/entertainment/strictly-come-dancing/strictly-come-dancing-stars-share-an-epic-selfie-as-they-head-to-blackpool-together/">arrives in Blackpool</a>, Kelvin is odds-on favourite at 4/7 - as he has been since his arrival on the show.</p>

      <p>In terms of who could be making their last dance at the seaside, bookmakers are pretty sure that Geordie comedian Chris Ramsey will be heading back to Tyneside.</p>
      <p>OddsMonkey spokesman Peter Watton commented: "Kelvin's dominance continues and bookmakers are not backing off as they are still seeing money for him, the public clearly love him.</p>
      <p>"And finally we saw the back of Mike Bushell, but now Chris Ramsey is odds-on at 8/13 to go and it hard to see him staying in."</p>

      <p>Although CBeebies star <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/tv/strictlys-karim-zeroual-rubbishes-curse/">Karim Zeroual</a> has received the most 10s from the judges, he is only second favourite to win because of Kelvin's huge popularity with the public.</p>
      <p>Viewers will remember that last year underdog <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/tv/strictly-come-dancings-kevin-clifton-breaks-down-as-he-and-stacey-dooley-win/">Stacey Dooley beat Joe Sugg, Faye Tozer and Ashley Roberts</a>, who were considered 'better' dancers, because of her 'journey' on the show.</p>
      <p>Her obvious chemistry with partner Kevin Clifton, now her <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/tv/kevin-clifton-kisses-stacey-dooley-in-romantic-pic/">boyfriend</a>, probably helped too!</p>
