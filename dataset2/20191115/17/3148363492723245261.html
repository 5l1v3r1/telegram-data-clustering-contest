      <p>Host Joe Scarborough shared with Jordan that he has spoken with Republicans “behind the scenes” and they want Trump out of office.</p>
      <p>Jordan said Republicans know the president is a “moron,” “corrupt” and behaves like “a classic scumbag.”</p>
      <p>
        <i>Partial transcript as follows:</i>
      </p>
      <blockquote>SCARBOROUGH: Elise, everybody Republican I’ve spoken with behind the scenes, they just shake their head. They’re like, “God.” MIKA BRZEZINSKI: They want it to end. SCARBOROUGH: They are counting the days until Donald Trump leaves office. JORDAN: Why not impeach? SCARBOROUGH: If they could turn off all the lights in the Senate when they voted to convict, they could would all vote to convict him and have Mike Pence as president in a second. JORDAN: They know he’s a moron. They know he’s corrupt. They know that his behavior is just a classic scumbag. And yet they just take it every single day.</blockquote>
