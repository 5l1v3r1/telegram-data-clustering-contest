      <h1>Michael van Gerwen heavy favourite as Grand Slam of Darts reaches quarter-finals</h1>
      <h2>Will the 4/5 favourite come out this weekend as Grand Slam champion?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T17:21:08+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 17:21</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Phillips, https://www.facebook.com/JournoTom/</a></address>
      <p>The Grand Slam of Darts is underway in Wolverhampton and we are down to the quarter-finals.</p>
      <p>Favourite Michael van Gerwen nearly suffered a shocking defeat to Ian White if Diamond did not miss the chance to hit double 5 to go 8-7 up.</p>
      <p>James Wade bowed out to Adrian Lewis while BDO representative Glen Durrant saw of a determined Gabriel Clemens.</p>
      <p>It looks set to be an exciting finals weekend starting with the quarter-finals with some heavyweight ties already lined up.</p>
      <p><a href="https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/DARTS/?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationwide&amp;utm_campaign=darts">The Pools</a> have had a look at the upcoming quarter-final clashes:</p>
      <p>
        <b>Dave Chisnall vs Peter Wright</b>
      </p>
      <p>Chizzy cruised through the group stages before seeing off qualifier Ryan Harrington in the second round.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Snakebite - 2017's finalist - saw off second-seed Rob Cross 10-3 with an average of 98.6. However, Chisnall is averaging 102.02 which is the tournament's highest at the moment.</p>
      <p>Dave Chisnall: <a href="https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/DARTS/?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationwide&amp;utm_campaign=darts">11/10</a></p>
      <p>Peter Wright: <a href="https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/DARTS/?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationwide&amp;utm_campaign=darts">8/11</a></p>
      <p>
        <b>Glen Durrant vs Michael Smith</b>
      </p>
      <p>Reigning BDO World Champion Durrant has already improved from last year's performance after being eliminated in the group stages.</p>
      <p>Bully Boy will want to live up to his nickname against the BDO champion - especially when he's a strong favourite to reach the semi-finals at least.</p>
      <p>Glen Durrant: <a href="https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/DARTS/?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationwide&amp;utm_campaign=darts">11/10</a></p>
      <p>Michael Smith: <a href="https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/DARTS/?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationwide&amp;utm_campaign=darts">8/11</a></p>
      <p>
        <b>Gerwyn Price vs Gary Anderson</b>
      </p>
      <p>It's 2018's Grand Slam Final all over again. The Iceman against The Flying Scotsman.</p>
      <p>Reigning champion Price could potentially face favourite van Gerwen in the semi-finals - provided he beats Anderson.</p>
      <p>Anderson is averaging at a low 90.97 while Price is averaging 98.75.</p>
      <p>Gerwyn Price: <a href="https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/DARTS/?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationwide&amp;utm_campaign=darts">7/10</a></p>
      <p>Gary Anderson: <a href="https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/DARTS/?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationwide&amp;utm_campaign=darts">23/20</a></p>
      <p>
        <b>Michael van Gerwen vs Adrian Lewis</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mighty Mike has the odds and the form behind him as he plays Jackpot.</p>
      <p>The Dutchman has not lost to Lewis since April 2017 - since then he has won nine games on the bounce against him - including in the group stages this year.</p>
      <p>Adrian Lewis fought until the very end as he saw off James Wade in a cracking thriller in the second round before setting up a fight as the one of only two PDC qualifiers left in the tournament.</p>
      <p>Michael van Gerwen: <a href="https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/DARTS/?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationwide&amp;utm_campaign=darts">1/9</a></p>
      <p>Adrian Lewis: <a href="https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/DARTS/?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationwide&amp;utm_campaign=darts">5/1</a></p>
