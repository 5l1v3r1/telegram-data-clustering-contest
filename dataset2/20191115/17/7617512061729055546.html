      <p>Campbell River RCMP are looking for four suspects after a break-in at Quinsam Communications early Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Police said two people made their way into the 16th Avenue business between 1:15 and 1:30 a.m. by smashing the glass in the front door. A third person entered at 4:45 a.m., followed by a fourth at 6:03 a.m.</p>
      <p>All were caught on surveillance video, but it is not clear if they were connected.</p>
      <p>“They could be linked but they might not be,” said Campbell River RCMP Const. Maury Tyre.</p>
      <p>He said the third and fourth people to appear at the store might have been walking by and seen a situation they could take advantage of.</p>
      <p>Tyre said the intruders took “all sorts of random things,” including an iPad, cords and cellphone covers.</p>
      <p>“Everybody did a quick grab.”</p>
