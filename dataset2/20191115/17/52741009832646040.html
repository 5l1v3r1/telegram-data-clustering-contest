      <p>NEWS RELEASE<br/>SHANNONDALE DEVELOPMENTS<br/>*************************<br/>Shannondale Developments announced today that it has completed the purchase of the former Electrohome factory located at 152 Shanley Street (The Site) in Kitchener with the intent to redevelop the site. The purchase price is not being disclosed.</p>
      <p>Shannondale has reviewed the community’s input for the site and shares the end goal of constructing a mid-rise, mixed-use building to improve the site and surrounding neighbourhood. The entire development project is expected to take approximately five years to complete. The first step will be to demolish the deteriorating structure in early 2020. This will allow for the remediation of known environmental contamination on the<br/>site.</p>
      <p>Shannondale Developments is a family-owned Toronto-based real estate investment and development with experience in real-estate assembly, design, development, and property management.</p>
      <p>The developer and consultant team will continue to engage and consult with the community and other stakeholders throughout the design process.</p>
