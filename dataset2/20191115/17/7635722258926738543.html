        <b>Students from University College Dublin (UCD) who are studying abroad in Hong Kong have been told to return home.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A small number of students are currently on exchange in partner universities in the territory.</p>
      <p>They are based at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and the University of Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>Professor Mark Rogers is registrar at UCD.</p>
      <p>He said: "We have been in direct contact with our students on exchange in CUHK and HKU.</p>
      <p>"We have also been in contact with the Department of Foreign Affairs."</p>
      <blockquote>"Both of these universities have been closed for the remainder of the term."</blockquote>
      <p>"We have recommended to our students that they return home, and working with our partner universities, we are providing them with the services and supports they need to do so."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Department of Foreign Affairs has updated its travel advice for Irish citizens in or travelling to Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>It says demonstrations can also take place with minimal warning, with related instances of arson, violence and vandalism.</p>
      <p>Irish citizens and members of the public are being urged to be particularly vigilant and are strongly advised to avoid areas where protests and unplanned public gatherings are taking place.</p>

      <p>It is also reminding people that the Hong Kong government has imposed restrictions on the wearing of 'facial coverings' which might prevent identification.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.newstalk.com/news/irish-consulate-hong-kong-close-amid-ongoing-protests-924415">Earlier this week</a>,</b> the Irish consulate in Hong Kong announced it would close for a time amid ongoing protests.</p>
      <p>It added that the situation on the ground was "fluid" and being kept under review.</p>
      <p>This followed an escalation of protests on Monday, when a protester was shot by police.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere a man who confronted protesters and asked "You are all not Chinese" was set on fire.</p>
      <p>While several injuries were also reported after a policeman appeared to deliberately ram his motorbike into a crowd of people during a citywide protest.</p>
      <p>The violence is the latest in protests which have lasted since June.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong's embattled leader Carrie Lam said the violence had far exceeded the call for democracy and that demonstrators are now the "people's enemy".</p>
