      <h1>'Swing-gate' TD Maria Bailey de-selected as Fine Gael election candidate</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T01:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 01:00</time> by <a rel="author">Aine McMahon, Press Association</a></address>
      <p>TD Maria Bailey has been taken off the general election ticket in Dun Laoghaire following a meeting of Fine Gael's national executive council.</p>
      <p>Ms Bailey tweeted last night that she had been "deleted as a candidate for the next general election" by taoiseach Leo Varadkar.</p>
      <p>Fine Gael later confirmed the de-selection.</p>
      <p>The party's National Executive Council made the decision in Dublin yesterday evening.</p>
      <p>Fine Gael members in Dun Laoghaire had carried a motion asking party headquarters to urgently review the general election ticket in Ms Bailey's constituency two weeks ago.</p>
      <p>That meeting heard that the party had taken a knock in the opinion polls following the controversy regarding Ms Bailey.</p>
      <p>The Dun Laoghaire TD has been under scrutiny since her compensation case for falling off a swing at the Dean Hotel in Dublin in 2015 came to light earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Ms Bailey was demoted following an internal review which found that she "overstated" the extent of her injuries.</p>
      <p>Court documents lodged as part of Ms Bailey's case stated that she could not run for three months after her fall but she took part in a 10km race three weeks after the incident.</p>
      <p>In an RTÃ‰ radio interview in May, she said the swing had not been properly supervised at the time of her fall.</p>
      <p>Ms Bailey has since withdrawn proceedings she filed against the Dean Hotel and was demoted by being removed as chairwoman of the Oireachtas Housing Committee.</p>
      <p>Party headquarters could now potentially replace Ms Bailey with newly elected councillor Jennifer Carroll MacNeill, who represents Killiney-Shankill on Dun Laoghaire County Council.</p>
      <p>Another newly elected local councillor, Lorraine Hall, has also been cited as a potential replacement for Ms Bailey on the ticket.</p>
      <p>Ms Bailey, Minister Mary Mitchell O'Connor and councillor Barry Ward were selected last year to contest the general election for Fine Gael in the four-seat constituency.</p>
