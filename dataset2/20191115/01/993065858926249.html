      <p>HERITAGE fashion brand Crew Clothing launches its first-ever store in Ireland this month.</p>
      <p>It will open a 1,000 sq ft unit at the Boulevard in Banbridge on November 21, its 14th outlet site, in a move which is creating around a dozen jobs.</p>
      <p>And it will be the eighth retailer to open this year at the Boulevard, which has reported a 15 per cent rise in footfall and a 24 per cent increase in sales in the year to date.</p>
      <p>Crew Clothing began trading 25 years ago in Salcombe, founded with a rugby shirt, a windsurfing school and a simple idea to create timeless clothes inspired by the British coast.</p>
      <p>Renowned for smart-casual men's and womenswear, it has diversified in recent years, expanding its lines to feminise the range while maintaining the versatility and brand values at its core.</p>
      <p>Crew Clothing's sales director Dan O'Callaghan said: “With a strong customer base from both Northern Ireland and the Republic, we have long hoped to find a suitable location for our first Crew store, and The Boulevard has everything we're looking for.</p>
      <p>“Its shopper demographic is very much akin to our target audience and this opportunity will help us reach brand fans across Ireland.</p>
      <p>“Outlets across the UK are bucking the trend for consumer spend and footfall, and our arrival at The Boulevard will be our 14th venture into this shopping sphere.”</p>
      <p>It joins new retailers Levi's, Radley, Suit Direct, Samsonite and Jack &amp; Jones Junior, and will trade alongside among more than 50 established brands including Jack Wills and Nike.</p>
      <p>Boulevard centre manager Chris Nelmes said: “Crew is a fantastic addition to our enviable retail offering as we approach to the end of what has been the site's best year to date.</p>
      <p>“We're attracting more shoppers than ever before, and the weak pound has meant we're now well established as the premier retail destination for those south of the border looking to get even more bang for their buck, on top of the already great discounts being offered here.”</p>
