      <h3>A man who allegedly defrauded 24 victims of more than $2 million has been arrested following a joint investigation by the Saskatoon police and Saskatoon RCMP.</h3>
      <p>Sixty-nine-year-old Vincent John Mullee was arrested Wednesday and faces charges of criminal breach of trust, fraud over $5,000 and laundering proceeds of crime.</p>
      <p>The investigation began when the Financial and Consumer Affairs Authority began investigating Mullee and his business as a independent financial advisor in June 2018. A subsequent investigation by detectives in the SPS economic crime section and Saskatoon RCMP’s provincial general investigation section.</p>
      <p>The investigation uncovered 24 victims of the alleged fraud — 13 of whom live within Saskatoon, with the remaining 11 living in areas within Saskatchewan and British Columbia.</p>
      <p>Mullee made his first court appearance on Thursday morning and is scheduled to make a second appearance on Nov. 28.</p>
