      <p>Amazon said on Thursday that it is contesting the Pentagon’s award of an up to US$10 billion cloud computing deal to Microsoft, expressing concern that politics got in the way of a fair contracting process, Reuters reports.</p>
      <p>The company filed notice last Friday that it will formally protest the decision on the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud, known as JEDI.</p>
      <p>In a company-wide meeting on Thursday, Amazon Web Services’ CEO Andy Jassy said it would be challenging for a US agency to award a contract objectively when the US president is disparaging one of the contestants, an Amazon spokesman was quoted as saying.</p>
      <p>US President Donald Trump has long criticized Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos.</p>
      <p>The company confirmed Jassy’s comments and said, “Numerous aspects of the JEDI evaluation process contained clear deficiencies, errors, and unmistakable bias- and it’s important that these matters be examined and rectified.”</p>
      <p>A challenge to the Defense Department’s award announced last month was widely expected by legal experts, analysts and consultants, especially after Trump publicly derided Amazon’s bid for the high-stakes contract, Reuters noted</p>
      <p>Trump had said in August that Amazon’s bid for the JEDI contract was under review by his administration after complaints from other companies.</p>
      <p>Amazon was considered a favorite for the contract, part of a broader digital modernization process of the Pentagon, before Microsoft emerged as the surprise winner.</p>
