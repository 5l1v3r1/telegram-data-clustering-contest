        <b>Missing In Translation</b>
        <br/>
        <b>‘<i>A Shesua Is A Creature…</i>’</b>
        <br/>
        <b>(<i>Niddah</i> 24a)</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Devarim</i> 14:7 states, “<i>Ach es zeh lo sochlu mi’ma’alei hagerah u’mi’mafrisei ha’parsah ha’shesua es hagamal v’es ha’arneves v’es hashafan…</i> – But of these you must not eat of those that chew their cud or have cloven hooves that are cleft through, the <i>shesua</i>, the camel, the hare and the hyrax…” According to R. Chanin bar Abba (quoted on our <i>daf</i>), the <i>shesua</i> is a creature that has both signs of <i>kashrus</i>. Nonetheless, it isn’t kosher. The Gemara notes that the <i>shesua</i> is an animal with two backs and two spines.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Not a Cow</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rav and Shmuel dispute the nature of the animal in question. Rav maintains that no animal species has two backs. Rather, the Torah is discussing a freak animal born to an ordinary kosher animal. The Gemara says that according to Rav, the Torah is teaching us that if a <i>shesua</i> fetus is found inside the womb of a slaughtered cow, it may not be eaten.</p>
      <p>
        <b>A Part Of The Whole</b>
      </p>
      <p>Shmuel contends that such an animal species (with two backs) does exist. The Gemara says that according to Shmuel, if one slaughters a cow and finds a double-backed, <i>shesua</i> fetus inside, it may be eaten because it’s the offspring of a kosher animal.</p>
      <p>We might ask: Why does the Gemara choose to frame the dispute of Rav and Shmuel in terms of a fetus discovered in a slaughtered mother’s womb (a <i>ben pakua</i>)? Why not just talk about a regular <i>shesua </i>(born of a kosher animal) that was slaughtered?</p>
      <p>
        <b>A Question Of Survivability</b>
      </p>
      <p>The answer is that it is impossible for a cow to give birth to a viable<i> shesua </i>(Rashi, sv “<i>b’veheima asur b’achila</i>”). Such a freak of nature cannot survive a pregnancy. And if it is aborted, it is forbidden for consumption according to all views because it is a <i>nevelah</i>.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the dispute is only in relation to a <i>shesua</i> that is a <i>ben pakua</i>, found in the womb after slaughter.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Missing Word</b>
      </p>
      <p>One difficulty with this Gemara – which is cited by Rashi in <i>Chumash</i> – is that Onkelos and all subsequent translators do not translate <i>shesua</i> as a unique species. They view the word as modifying the split hoof characteristic – it tells us that it is a completely separated split hoof.</p>
      <p>Since <i>shesua</i> is only a species found in the womb of a cow, as well as a matter of dispute, perhaps translators were not ready to translate in such a manner that would imply that <i>shesua </i>has the full-fledged status of a species.</p>
      <p>The Ramban maintains the dispute concerns whether a cow can actually give birth to such an animal. Rav maintains that it is impossible, while Shmuel contends that it is possible and that is exactly what the <i>pasuk</i> prohibits, a live birth <i>shesua</i> but not a <i>ben pakua</i> found subsequent to the mother’s slaughter.</p>
