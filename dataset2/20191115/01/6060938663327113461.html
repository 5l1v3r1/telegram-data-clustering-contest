The duo was cast together for revenge drama ‘Marjaavaan’ and Tara landed the opportunity to romance Sidharth on the silver screen.

Reacting to the dating rumours, Tara said, “I don't think it's ever awkward. I think it is part of what we do and I think that that's bound to happen. And its fun it's sort of flattering in a way that people see a chemistry and, and write about that and things like that and it's part of what we do.”</p>
