      <h1>Moody’s downgrades banking’s outlook</h1>

        <b>The US rating agency Moody’s has downgraded the outlook for Portuguese banks from ‘positive’ to ‘stable’, due to the slowdown in economic growth in the country and the euro area.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Maria Vinuela, an analyst with the financial rating agency, said she hoped that the capital of Portuguese banks, profits, and financing conditions will remain stable over the next 12-18 months.</p>
      <p>“Profits are likely to remain close to current low levels, with lower spending on provisions and cost-cutting initiatives largely offsetting moderate turnover and very low-interest rates,” the analyst said.</p>
      <p>Moody’s further predicts that banks’ non-productive assets will continue to fall organically and helped by portfolio sales but will remain high by European standards. “Its [Portuguese] average non-performing loan was 8.9 percent at the end of June, compared to a European Union average of 3.0 percent,” the agency said.</p>
      <p>The US institution also believes that the financing needs of Portuguese banks will remain low thanks to deleveraging and a stable deposit base.</p>
      <p>“Portugal’s economic growth moderated in the first half of 2019 to 1.9 percent, and Moody’s expects it to slow to 1.7 percent for 2019 as a whole, then converging to a potential rate of 1.5 percent,” the agency noted.</p>
      <p>Moody’s pointed out that although credit conditions in the country have improved, household debt remains above the eurozone average.</p>
      <p>The five largest banks in Portugal recorded aggregate profits of €983.1 million up to September this year, a decrease of €405.4 million compared to the same period in 2018.</p>
