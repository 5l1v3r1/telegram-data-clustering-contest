        <b>Bringing the Algarve closer to Andalusia with the implementation of a “European laboratory” of cross-border governance is one of the objectives of the “EuroGuadiana2020” project.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The acting president of the Guadiana eurocity, Natalia Santos, told Lusa that the project aims to provide the eurocity - made up of Castro Marim, Vila Real de Santo António and Ayamonte - with mechanisms to make the border a point of connection between both regions.</p>
      <p>EuroGuadiana 2020 aims to implement a European laboratory of cross-border governance, in which experts from the three municipalities and the universities of the Algarve and Huelva (Spain) will seek “points of union” and “differentiation” that can bring the two sides of the border together.</p>
      <p>The European cross-border cooperation programme INTERREG VA Spain-Portugal, considers this “first permanent laboratory of cross-border governance in the euroregion Alentejo-Algarve-Andalusia” will begin to “dilute the border more directly”.</p>
      <p>The initiative will be based on “working to see what the needs are” in that cross-border area and, “with the support of the European Union, addressing the problems and finding solutions to the needs that are detected”.</p>
      <p>“It will address cultural, sporting, linguistic and organisational issues, but above all we will work on planning for the future and we will do so with the support and collaboration of the best, as shown by the presence of the universities of Huelva and the Algarve”.</p>
