      <h1>Labour pledges universal broadband and nationwide fibre, will renationalise the farcical, terrible BT Openreach</h1>

      <p>Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party have pledged universal, free broadband and a nationwide fibre buildout by 2030 if elected; they plan to renationalise parts of BT and tax Big Tech to pay for the fibre rollout.</p>
      <p>BT under private ownership has been a catastrophe, especially the privatised, spun-out installation business Openreach, whose bureaucratic incompetence, arrogance, hostility and sheer, pig-headed idiocy make them seem like something out of a poorest-quality farce comedy. Labour proposes to re-nationalise this embarrassment of a company and make it pull its fucking socks up for literally the first time since it was privatised.</p>
      <p>Boris Johnson's Conservatives have pledged a £5b fibre rollout; Labour has priced the rollout at a much more realistic £30b (BT estimates the cost at £40b, but they also estimated my broadband speed at 20mbps and rarely delivered 5).</p>
      <p>I am a member of the Labour Party and a proud donor to Jeremy Corbyn's campaign.</p>
      <blockquote>The plan includes nationalising parts of BT - namely its digital network arm Openreach - to create a UK-wide network owned by the government. <br/><br/>"We're putting the money in and therefore we should own the benefit as well," said the shadow chancellor. <br/><br/>He said the roll-out would begin with communities that have the worst broadband access, followed by towns and smaller centres, and then by areas that are currently well served. <br/><br/>A Labour government would compensate shareholders by issuing government bonds. He said Labour had taken legal advice, including ensuring pension funds with investments in BT are not left out of pocket.</blockquote>
