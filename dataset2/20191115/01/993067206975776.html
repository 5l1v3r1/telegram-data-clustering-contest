      <p>A BANNER asking if Shankill bomber Sean Kelly will be campaigning for SDLP Westminster candidate Claire Hanna has been put up in south Belfast.</p>
      <p>The SDLP has already said that Kelly will not form part of any of its canvassing teams.</p>
      <p>The banner was put up at the junction of Oak Street and Donegall Pass - a traditionally loyalist area in the south of the city.</p>
      <p>Ms Hanna <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2019/11/05/news/sinn-fe-in-withdraws-to-give-claire-hanna-best-chance-in-south-belfast-1756551/">is the only nationalist candidate in the South Belfast constituency</a>.</p>

      <p>Sinn Féin said it would not stand in the area to maximise the chances of remain candidate Ms Hanna.</p>
      <p>Kelly, who planted an IRA bomb on the Shankill in 1993 that killed nine people, is an election worker for Sinn Féin in north Belfast.</p>

      <p>The DUP's Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has previously claimed that a vote for the SDLP was akin to a vote for Sinn Féin in the December 12 general election.</p>
      <p>"Sean Kelly has been canvassing for Sinn Fein in North Belfast, but will he now be canvassing on behalf of the SDLP too?" he said.</p>
      <p>"I accept everyone can have a past and can change, but Sean Kelly has shown no remorse for murdering nine innocent people, including two children."</p>
      <p>An SDLP spokesman branded Sir Jeffrey's comments as "fake news".</p>
