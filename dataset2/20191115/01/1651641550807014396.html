      <p>Last month Microsoft <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/big-news-microsoft-beats-amazon-to-win-the-10-us-defense-jedi-contract/">announced</a> that the company has finally won the JEDI contract worth $10b. The company signed the contract for 10 years with the Pentagon to provide cloud infrastructure such as Platform as a Service (PaaS).</p>
      <p>The major competitor for Microsoft during the whole process was Amazon and some even speculated that Amazon will the contract. However, it looks like the fight might not be over just yet. According to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50428744">BBC</a>, Amazon is gearing up to file an appeal to the Court of Federal Claims. The company has already submitted its intention to protest against the decision last Friday.</p>
      <blockquote>Amazon Web Services is uniquely experienced and qualified to provide the critical technology the US military needs, and remains committed to supporting the DoD’s modernisation efforts.<br/>We also believe it’s critical for our country that the government and its elected leaders administer procurements objectively and in a manner that is free from political influence.<br/>Numerous aspects of the JEDI evaluation process contained clear deficiencies, errors and unmistakable bias – and it’s important that these matters be examined and rectified.<br/>– Amazon</blockquote>
      <p>There were four companies in the race which included IBM, Oracle, Microsoft and Amazon. The former two were eliminated at the later stage leaving Microsoft and Amazon. The contract is especially important since there are speculations that other departments will follow the Pentagon’s footsteps and upgrade their infrastructures in the future.</p>
