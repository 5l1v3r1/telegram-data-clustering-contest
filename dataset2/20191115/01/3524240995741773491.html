      <p>The Association of the Wives of the Head of Service, Female Permanent Secretaries and Wives of Permanent Secretaries in Ekiti State on Thursday distributed school materials and uniforms to pupils of Olobe L.A-Nursery and Primary School, Oke-Ila, Ado-Ekiti.</p>
      <p>President of the association and wife of the Head of Service, Mrs Olufunmilola Ajayi, said it was an act of giving back to society. She enjoined Nigerians “to focus on giving a lease of life to indigent pupils in schools in order to have a better society.”</p>
      <p>Ajayi said members of the association, persuaded by the fact that “a life worthy of emulation is one that strives to help others,” would continue to contribute meaningfully to the welfare needs of others to change the society”.</p>
      <p>Wife of the Ekiti State Governor, Mrs Bisi Fayemi, who spoke on the occasion, called on stakeholders in the state to lend a helping hand towards providing educational materials and a more conducive learning environment to school pupils across the state.</p>
      <p>The governor’s wife, represented by a Senior Special Assistant, Mrs Tokunbo Gbadamosi, praised the association for taking the bold step and called on other members of the public to follow suit.</p>
      <p>She charged teachers to always remain vigilant and report issues as they affected pupils to the appropriate quarters while she encouraged the pupils to reciprocate the gestures by excelling in their studies.</p>
