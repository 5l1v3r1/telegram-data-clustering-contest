      <h1>Number of children in Northern Ireland in need of Childline counselling for sexual exploitation up 44 per cent</h1>

      <p>THE number of children in Northern Ireland in need of Childline counselling sessions last year as a result of sexual exploitation rose by 44 per cent.</p>
      <p>Figures from the charity for 2018/2-19 reveal a total of 140 sessions were delivered to children in the north as a result of them having been groomed and forced into sexual activity.</p>
      <p>This was up from 97 sessions in 2017/18.</p>
      <p>Of the 244 counselling sessions delivered in Northern Ireland by Childline last year, sexual exploitation featured in more than half.</p>
      <p>In 60 per cent of sessions, young people from the north targeted online - including through social media or video games – often by their peers or people known to them.</p>
      <p>Most commonly children from Northern Ireland received help from Childline because they had been tricked into sending naked images or videos of themselves or had been in contacted or groomed by someone wanting to sexually exploit them.</p>
      <p>Young people told Childline they would receive affection or gifts in exchange for performing sexual activities while others were persuaded to share sexual images online, and then threatened the images would be shared with friends or family.</p>
      <p>Mairead Monds, Childline Service manager for Belfast, said: “Sadly, we are hearing from young people every day who are being manipulated or blackmailed into carrying out sexual acts.</p>
      <p>"For many, this impacts on their mental health and leaves them feeling isolated from the people closest to them. Some turn to self-harm, alcohol or substance misuse as ways of coping with their experiences".</p>
      <p>She added: "Everyone must be prepared to confront this problem, from government right through to schools, parents, professionals, and us at Childline.</p>
      <p>"The Department of Education should build on existing good practice and developments to ensure teachers are confident to teach Relationships and Sexuality Education and Childline needs more volunteers to make sure they can be there for every child who need our help, at all times of day and night".</p>
