      <p>BRASILIA, Nov 15 — Russia plans to deliver S-400 surface-to-air missile systems to India on schedule, President Vladimir Putin said yesterday.</p>
      <p>India agreed to buy the S-400 system from Russia last year despite US warnings the purchase could trigger sanctions against it. India said it needed the weapons to bolster its defences against China.</p>
      <p>“As far as the S-400 deliveries are concerned, everything is going according to plan. Our Indian colleagues have not asked to speed anything up, it's all going fine,” Putin told reporters at a summit of BRICS countries in Brazil. — Reuters</p>
