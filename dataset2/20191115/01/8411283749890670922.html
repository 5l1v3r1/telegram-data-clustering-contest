      <h1>Korea 5G service subscribers to top 5 million by year-end 2019</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T01:17:50+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 01:17</time> by <a rel="author">Max Wang, Taipei; Steve Shen, DIGITIMES</a></address>
      <p>The number of 5G service subscribers in South Korea is expected to reach over five million by the end of 2019, a significant growth from four million at the end of July, according to Samsung Electronics.</p>
      <p>The fast build-up of 5G networks in Korea contributes to the exponential growth of its 5G service subscribers, said Daijun Zhang, president of Samsung R&amp;D Institute China-Beijing (SRC-B).</p>
      <p>The penetration rate of 5G networks in 85 cities in Korea will reach 93% by the end of 2019, providing applications such as smart manufacturing solutions for the B2B market, as well as cloud, VR and audio/video streaming services for the B2C market, Zhang indicated.</p>
      <p>Judging from the growth of its service subscribers, the penetration rate of 5G service in Korea is growing about 2.5 times faster than that for the 4G service for the same period of time, making 5G development in Korea a benchmark globally, Zhang commented.</p>
      <p>The launch of related 5G services has also helped raise ARPU (average revenue per user) by 20% for Korea's telecom operators, according to Chen Chi-meng, vice president of mobile and information business unit at Samsung Taiwan.</p>
      <p>The penetration rate of 5G phones in Korea is expected to reach 30% in 2020, up from nearly 10% in 2019, Chen estimated, noting that Samsung currently accounts for 80% of Korea's 5G phone market.</p>
