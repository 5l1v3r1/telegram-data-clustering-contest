      <h1>TikTok test lets users link to the products in their videos</h1>
      <h2>The platform is opening up social commerce options.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T01:03:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 01:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.engadget.com/editors/georgina-torbet" target="_blank">Georgina Torbet</a></address>
      <p>Short video platform TikTok is experimenting with letting people find and buy products from within the app, by testing new features designed to direct visitors to e-commerce sites.</p>
      <p>With the new feature, TikTok users will be able to add a link to their videos to send viewers to a third-party sites where they can purchase products shown. In addition, users will also be able add one URL to their profile page.</p>
      <p>The new features were first revealed by Fabian Bern, founder of Chinese influencer marketing agency Uplab, who shared them with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/15/tiktok-link-bio-social-commerce/"><i>TechCrunch</i></a> in a video on Twitter. Speaking to <i>TechCrunch</i>, a TikTok representative said the features are part of the company's "experimentation" to improve the app.</p>

      <p>TikTok's new features are very similar to Instagram's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/06/12/instagram-stories-shopping/">sales through Stories</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/03/20/instagram-shoppable-posts-expand-to-8-more-countries/">shoppable posts</a>. These are commonly used by large and small Instagram influencers for affiliate marketing, although the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/09/17/instagram-shopping-in-explore/">influx of shopping content</a> on the platform in the last few years has been off-putting for some.</p>
      <p>Instagram and TikTok have been competing hard for similar social media real estate and have taken to copying each other's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/12/instagram-reels-scenes-video-editing-tiktok/?guccounter=2">most popular features</a>. Instagram is the bigger platform of the two, with <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/social-media/">a billion active users</a> compared to TikTok's 500 million active users. TikTok is growing fast though, being the <a href="https://www.oberlo.com/blog/tiktok-statistics">most downloaded app</a> in Apple's App Store in Q1 2019.</p>
      <p>TikTok also has the advantage of being popular with a key demographic: young people, with <a href="https://blog.globalwebindex.com/trends/tiktok-music-social-media/">41 percent</a> of its users being between 16 and 24. That makes it a valuable target for brands who want to connect with younger customers, and these experimental features indicate the company is focusing in on this area.</p>
