      <p>THE DUP and Sinn Féin face a significant slide in support in next month's Westminster election, according to the findings of a new opinion poll.</p>
      <p>The Lucid Talk Northern Ireland 'Tracker' Poll shows the north's big two securing a 52 per cent share of the vote, compared with the 65.4 per cent they together polled in the 2017 snap general election.</p>
      <p>The most significant drop, according to the opinion poll, is for the DUP, whose support falls eight percentage points to 28 per cent, while Sinn Féin drops from 29.4 per cent to 24 per cent.</p>
      <p>The biggest winner in the Lucid Talk survey, which was conducted a fortnight ago, is Alliance which receives a 16 per cent share compared to 7.9 per cent at the last Westminster election.</p>
      <p>The SDLP too enjoys a fillip with 14 per cent of the vote, compared to 11.7 in 2017.</p>
      <p>The poll was commissioned by Electoral Calculus and Remain United, and was carried out before Lady Sylvia Hermon withdrew in North Down. It was also conducted ahead of the TUV saying it wouldn't be running candidates and the Greens withdrawing from a number of seats.</p>
      <p>The opinion poll results emerged as candidate nominations for the December 12 general election closed yesterday at 4 pm.</p>
      <p>A total of 102 candidates will be running across the north's 18 constituencies, compared to 109 at the last general election.</p>
      <p>The DUP plan to contest all seats bar Sinn Féin-held Fermanagh and South Tyrone, where the party is backing former Ulster Unionist leader Tom Elliott.</p>
      <p>Sinn Féin announced earlier this month that it will not field candidates in South Belfast, East Belfast and North Down, in a bid to maximise the pro-Remain vote. Likewise, the SDLP has withdrew in North Belfast, East Belfast and North Down.</p>
      <p>Alliance is the only party running in all 18 constituencies, while the Ulster Unionists stood aside in DUP-held North Belfast and won't be running in West Belfast, despite an initial pledge to contest all the north's seats.</p>
      <p>Aontú will run candidates for the first time in a general election. The anti-abortion republican party will stand in seven constituencies including Foyle, West Tyrone and Newry &amp; Armagh.</p>
      <p>People Before Profit is running two candidates.</p>
      <p>The Green Party is running in three areas and the NI Conservative Party is fighting four seats. Both parties fielded seven candidates each in 2017. UKIP will run two candidates while three independents also plan to run.</p>
      <p>Traditional Unionist Voice will not run any candidates in the election.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, UTV has announced that its one-hour UTV Election Debate programme, featuring senior representatives from the five main parties, will go out at 8pm on Sunday December 8 and will be moderated by Marc Mallett.</p>
