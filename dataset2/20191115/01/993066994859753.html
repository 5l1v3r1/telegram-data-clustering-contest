      <p>THE owner of a Chinese takeaway who sexually assaulted a young woman then "barked like a dog" on the street after following her home was starting a six-month stint behind bars yesterday.</p>
      <p>Belfast Crown Court heard the incident involving Yuwen Chen (36) and the young woman occurred at his takeaway in North Belfast on December 23 last year.</p>
      <p>Crown prosecutor Philip Henry revealed Chen, a father-of-three from Graymount Terrace in Newtownabbey, initially also faced a charge of false imprisonment, which was subsequently subsumed into a charge of sexual assault.</p>
      <p>Mr Henry revealed that on the evening in question, Chen was working in the takeaway where he offered the 18-year old complainant some whiskey. Already unsteady on his feet, Chen told the young woman he loved her and tried to kiss her.</p>
      <p>He then pushed her to the floor and sexually assaulted her. The woman attempted to flee the premises when Chen became sick but he caught her in the street and pulled her back in.</p>
      <p>She made a second attempt to flee but was pushed to the ground and assaulted again.</p>
      <p>A man who heard her screams helped free her and walked her home. However she was followed home by the Chen who told her he was sorry. He also got down in his hands and knees outside her home where he "barked like a dog" then "lay down and tried to sleep."</p>
      <p>He was arrested at the scene but when questioned claimed he couldn't recall what happened as he had drunk too much.</p>
      <p>He later admitted a charge of sexual assault.</p>
      <p>The young woman's mother later reported that when her daughter came home, she was upset and in a state of shock. Her jeans were also ripped and her knees were cut.</p>
      <p>Defence barrister Michael Tierney said that since arriving here in 2012, Chen has been industrious and set up his own takeaway business.</p>
      <p>The defence barrister said Chen was "ashamed by what he did" and had been "drink-free" since the incident.</p>
      <p>Sending Chen to jail, Judge Smyth said: "There can be no doubt this must have been a very frightening experience for this young woman."</p>
