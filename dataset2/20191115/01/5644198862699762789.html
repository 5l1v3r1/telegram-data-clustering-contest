      <p>Marcello Lippi has resigned as head coach of the China national team after seeing his side slip to a 2-1 loss to Syria in qualifying for the 2022 World Cup in Dubai on Thursday.</p>
      <p>HONG KONG: Marcello Lippi has resigned as head coach of the China national team after seeing his side slip to a 2-1 loss to Syria in qualifying for the 2022 World Cup in Dubai on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The Italian quit during his news conference after an own goal from defender Zhang Linpeng left China five points adrift of the table-topping Syrians at the halfway point of the qualification group stage.</p>

      <p>"My pay is very high, and I take all the blame," Lippi was quoted as saying by the Chinese media.</p>
      <p>"I am quitting as China coach."</p>
      <p>Only the winners from each of the eight qualification groups for the finals in Qatar will advance to the next round, with the four runners-up with the best records also progressing.</p>
      <p>China, who are attempting to qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 2002, are currently in second place in Group A with seven points alongside the Philippines, with Syria holding a maximum 12 points from their first four games.</p>
      <p>This is the second time this year that Lippi, who led Italy to a World Cup triumph in 2006, has left the role as China's head coach.</p>
      <p>The 71-year-old, who also won five Serie A titles and a Champions League across two spells in charge of Juventus, reversed his decision to stand down from the role in January having refused to sign a new contract following the team's quarter-final exit at the Asian Cup.</p>
      <p>His return came in March after compatriot Fabio Cannavaro helmed the country during the China Cup friendly tournament on an interim basis and was followed by a series of attempts to bolster the national squad.</p>
      <p>England-born midfielder Nico Yennaris became the first overseas-born player to be selected by China. Soon after Elkeson, a Brazilian striker who has set scoring records in the Chinese Super League, was the first player without Chinese ancestry to gain citizenship and play for China.</p>
      <p>Those additions, though, have not been enough to improve the squad and Lippi has been under pressure since his team was held to a 0-0 draw last month by the Philippines.</p>
