      <p>HOT on the heels of losing midfielder Mattie Donnelly for six months due to a hamstring injury, Tyrone have been dealt a further blow with the news that forward Connor McAliskey has decided to take a break from inter-county football next season.</p>
      <p>The Clonoe clubman, who joined the Red Hands' senior set-up in 2013, says he is “physically and mentally” unable to give the commitment required for 2020 but added that “the door isn't closed” on his Tyrone career.</p>
      <p>McAliskey helped the county win back-to-back Ulster titles in 2016 and 2017 and battled back from a career-threatening injury to propel Mickey Harte's men to the All-Ireland final in 2018.</p>
      <p>He was the focal point of Tyrone's attack that year, starting all 10 Championship games and registered two goals and 41 points including match-winning hauls of 1-8 against Meath, 1-6 against Cork and three points in the All-Ireland final. The contrast with the game-time he saw in the 2019 season is startling. With Harte opting for a more direct approach led by Cathal McShane and Mattie Donnelly, McAliskey started just one Championship match – a dead-rubber Super8 tie against Dublin at Healy Park in which he top-scored with five points – and made eight other substitute appearances. In all of those he worked feverishly to make an impact and registered a combined 1-5 that included 1-2 against Antrim.</p>
      <p>In recent years fellow forwards Darren McCurry, Lee Brennan and Ronan O'Neill have all walked away because of limited opportunities in a Tyrone side that has reached the final four in their last three Championship campaigns. Now McAliskey has followed suit.</p>
      <p>“It's a personal decision for me,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It has been a tough couple of years for me both in terms of injuries and personally and I just feel the time is right to take a step back and be selfish and put myself first.</p>
      <p>“I know the sort of commitment levels that it takes to perform consistently at the highest level and I'm not the sort of person that will do anything if I can't do it 100 per cent. I just feel that physically and mentally I'm not ready to commit to next season and Mickey fully understands my decision.</p>
      <p>“He respected what I said to him and he said that if I think of things differently next year then we can sit down and talk and see if I have something to offer. The door isn't closed on my Tyrone career but for the moment I have to be greedy for once and put myself first.”</p>
      <p>McAliskey, who turned 28 this week, has had a difficult time over the past two years. He recovered from dislocating his knee in a McKenna Cup game against Cavan in Breffni Park in 2017 to play his part in Tyrone's march to the All-Ireland final the following year during which he was forced to come to terms with the sudden death of brother-in-law Christopher Colhoun, husband of his sister Lisa.</p>
      <p>There were rumours that quicksilver forward could now be prepared to try his hand at soccer. The 28-year-old is playing for Coalisland Athletic in the Mid-Ulster League at present but he says he has no plans to pursue a switch to the Irish League.</p>
      <p>“I am playing bit of soccer at the minute,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I'm just playing with my friends in the Mid-Ulster League, it's not soccer at Irish League level. It's nothing to do with my decision to step away.</p>
      <p>“I'm playing for Coalisland Athletic in Mid-Ulster One. I'm friendly with boys from Clonoe and Coalisland and it was something different to do on a Saturday. I had always played so when Clonoe finished up this year I decided to kick a bit again with them – it's just for enjoyment.”</p>
