      <p>We're sure that <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/Fabolous/profile">Fabolous</a>'s beat to his single "B.O.M.B.S." certainly wasn't intended for Adrienne Houghton. Just a day <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/adrienne-houghton-confirms-fabolouss-you-be-killin-em-beat-was-made-for-her-news.95592.html">after <i>The Real</i> host shared with the world that the beat for Fab's 2010 hit "You Be Killin Em" </a>was created by <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/RyanLeslie/profile">Ryan Leslie</a> for her, Fab returns to the scene with a new track where the Brooklyn rapper delivers straightforward bars.</p>
      <p>The rapper quietly released "B.O.M.B.S.," or "Back On My Bullsh*t," on Friday without giving any formal revelations about the track on social media. The single shows Fab holding things down solo without leaning on a feature, and while the rapper has, in the past, created hits with his fellow famous emcees, he reminds the world that he doesn't rely on assistance. Give it a spin and let us know what you think.</p>

      <p>Ay, now I got a three-peat<br/>Gotta flood the streets 'til they knee deep<br/>Gotta stay woke can't be sleep<br/>All this fly shit don't be cheap<br/>All these bad bitches that we keep 'round<br/>Pockets gotta big deep now</p>
