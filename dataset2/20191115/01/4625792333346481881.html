      <p>Federal prosecutors are investigating Rudy Giuliani, President Trump’s personal lawyer, for possible campaign finance violations and failure to register as a foreign agent.</p>
      <p>Three U.S. officials confirmed the substance of the investigation <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-15/giuliani-faces-u-s-probe-on-campaign-finance-lobbying-breaches">to Bloomberg</a>. Giuliani could also be under scrutiny for possible violations of laws against bribing foreign officials or conspiracy.</p>
      <p>An official said Giuliani’s activities have sparked counterintelligence concerns but he likely wouldn’t face criminal charges related to that.</p>
      <p>Giuliani has been a central figure in the impeachment proceedings, which seek to determine if Trump abused his power by pressuring the Ukrainian government to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden. Giuliani aided in the effort to get Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter, as well as the origins of the Russia investigation.</p>
      <p>The former New York City mayor is under investigation by the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan. Two of his associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were arrested last month on charges on illegal campaign contributions.</p>
      <p>Trump has thus far shown no signs of distancing himself from his lawyer. Last month, he told reporters Giuliani is a “good man.”</p>
      <p>Giuliani told the<i> Guardian</i> that Trump is “<a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/giuliani-jokes-he-has-very-good-insurance-if-trump-throws-him-under-bus">a very loyal guy</a>” when discussing whether he is nervous that Trump would pin the blame on him for the Ukraine controversy.</p>
