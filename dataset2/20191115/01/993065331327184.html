      <p>The latest survey in relation to family doctors in Northern Ireland will add to the sense that the under-pressure GP service is facing an even more difficult future.</p>
      <p>A report by the Royal College of General Practitioners in Northern Ireland (RCGPNI) has found that a quarter of GPs surveyed believe they will not be working in general practice in the north in five years' time.</p>
      <p>The most common reasons given were retirement and stress. A third of GPs felt so stressed at least once a week that they could not cope.</p>
      <p>There is no doubt that surgeries, the first point of contact for most patients in the health service, are under enormous strain.</p>
      <p>The average number of registered patients per practice has increased by 11 per cent since 2014 while the demographic is of an increasingly elderly population with a rising need for medical services.</p>
      <p>Where once it was possible to get a GP appointment within a couple of days, now patients are resigned to waiting weeks to see their doctor.</p>
      <p>This is having a knock-on effect with people going to emergency departments with ailments that could be dealt with at the primary care stage, intensifying the problems being felt at hospitals.</p>
      <p>Clearly, there are major issues with regard to workload but the medical profession is also facing acute problems in attracting and retaining GPs.</p>
      <p>It is not unusual to hear of long established, mainly rural, practices shutting their doors for good when a local GP retires but unfortunately there is a shortage of young doctors wanting to work in this area of medicine.</p>
      <p>The Department of Health has increased the number of GP training places but this year not all of those places have been filled, which is hugely disappointing.</p>
      <p>The authorities need to understand why doctors are reluctant to train as a GP or run a practice.</p>
      <p>According to this survey, stress and workload are key concerns but the rising cost of securing medical indemnity in Northern Ireland is seen as a significant financial burden.</p>
      <p>Quite simply, the health service in Northern Ireland cannot afford to lose more doctors from general practice than are being trained.</p>
      <p>If anything we need to be doing more to hold on to experienced medics and ensuring sufficient numbers are coming through to sustain this vital element of the healthcare system.</p>
