      <h3>BTC could drop towards the $8,500 region</h3>
      <p>According to Cointelegraph contributor Horus Hughes, Bitcoin’s price has <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-defies-death-cross-as-bulls-pin-hopes-on-91k-bounce">pierced</a> the $8,674 support three times over the past 4 days, increasing the chance that BTC might revisit lower lows around $8,480. </p>
      <p>Hughes added that in the event of a falling wedge breakdown, Bitcoin’s price could drop further to $7,862. However, he thinks that before this scenario plays out, it is likely that buyers will step in around $8,300 and $8,000.</p>
      <p>Ether (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price-index">ETH</a>), meanwhile, has also been trading sideways, currently sitting at around $185. The number one altcoin saw a small dip in sync with BTC to show a slight loss of around 1.74% at publishing time.</p>

      </p>
      <p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index">XRP</a>, the third-largest coin by market capitalization, is no exception to today’s trend of minor losses. The token sits at around $0.270 per coin, down 2.62% on the day at press time. The news that Coinbase’s Visa debit card <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-card-adds-xrp-and-launches-in-10-more-european-countries">expanded</a> support for five more cryptocurrencies in ten new European jurisdictions, including XRP, has had no effect on the coin’s price behavior.</p>
