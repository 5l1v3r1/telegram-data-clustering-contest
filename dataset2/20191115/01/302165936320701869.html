      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 15 — The ringgit rebounded at the opening today on technical correction ahead of the third-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) announcement.</p>
      <p>At 9am, the ringgit was quoted at 4.1470/1500 versus the US dollar against 4.1560/1590 yesterday.</p>
      <p>Axi Trader Asia-Pacific market strategist Stephen Innes said traders would now look to Malaysia GDP print for monetary policy clues.</p>
      <p>“But with the market singular focused on the trade talks, the GDP print may need to blow out the expectation to get a significant rise from the ringgit bulls,” he said in a statement today.</p>
      <p>The local note was mixed against other major currencies.</p>
      <p>The ringgit increased against the Singapore dollar to 3.0468/0501 from yesterday’s close of 3.0492/0532 and appreciated against the yen to 3.8186/8217 from 3.8269/8300.</p>
      <p>However, it eased against the British pound to 5.3430/3473 from 5.3396/3451 and declined versus the euro to 4.5725/5762 from 4.5716/5757. — Bernama</p>
