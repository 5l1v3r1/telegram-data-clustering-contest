      <h1>Ronaldo walks out on Juventus</h1>

        <b>Cristiano Ronaldo was subbed ten minutes after half-time in the 1-0 victory over AC Milan.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Reports suggested that Ronaldo called manager Maurizio Sarri a ‘son of a whore’ before storming down the tunnel to the changing rooms.</p>
      <p>According to Gazzetta dello Sport, the 34-year-old will not be fined for his outburst at Sarri but will be expected to apologise to his team-mates for not returning to the bench. In addition Ronaldo also risked receiving a two-year ban due to anti-doping regulations, after leaving the Allianz Stadium before the end of the game, but this is most unlikely.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo’s outburst and lack of punishment has underlined how the five-time Ballon d’Or winner is above the law in Turin – something Sarri will have to get used to, according to Corriere dello Sport.</p>
      <p>The Juventus manager confirmed after the game that there was no issue with Ronaldo and that he understands his frustrations. The Italian boss explained that injury was the reason why he brought Ronaldo off in the second-half. ‘We must thank Ronaldo, because he made a sacrifice to be there at all tonight in a difficult situation,’ Sarri explained.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo is now away on international duty with Portugal and will return for Juventus’ Serie A clash with Atalanta next weekend.</p>
