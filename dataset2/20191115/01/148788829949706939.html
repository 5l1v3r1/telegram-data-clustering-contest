      <h1>‘Prince of Cats’: Spike Lee’s Next Movie is an ’80s Hip-Hop Spin on ‘Romeo and Juliet’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T01:00:50+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 01:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.slashfilm.com/author/hoai-tran-bui/" target="_blank">Hoai-Tran Bui</a></address>
      <p>Hot off the Oscar success of 2018’s <i>BlacKkKlansman</i>, <b>Spike Lee</b> has signed onto his next project. Lee is heading back to the ’80s with Legendary’s <b><i>Prince of Cats</i></b>, which he is set to write and direct. Described as an ’80s-set “hip-hop take on Shakespeare’s <i>Romeo &amp; Juliet</i>,” <i>Prince of Cats</i> is based on the graphic novel by <b>Ron Wimberly</b>.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/spike-lee-direct-romeo-juliet-tale-prince-cats-1254584">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Lee has signed on to direct Legendary’s <i>Prince of Cats</i>, an adaptation of the graphic novel written and illustrated by Ron Wimberly. <i>Prince of Cats</i> is a hip-hop twist on <i>Romeo &amp; Juliet</i> set in the ’80s, told through the perspective of Tybalt, Juliet’s hot-headed cousin quick to a duel — or in this case, an emcee-off (I don’t know if this is the case, that’s just my guess). Apparently actual dueling will take place in this film, with “underground sword dueling” with katanas being a popular pastime. Where these Brooklyn kids got katanas from is beyond me. Were katanas a popular item in the ’80s? In this film they are.</p>
      <p>Here is the film’s logline per THR:</p>
      <blockquote>The film centers on Tybalt and his Capulet brothers, who navigate Da People’s Republic of Brooklyn, where underground sword dueling — including katanas — with the rival Montagues blossoms into a vibrant world. That world includes hip-hop essentials such as DJing, emceeing, breakdancing and graffiti.</blockquote>
      <p>Lee is rewriting the script with Wimberly and writer <b>Selwyn Seyfu Hinds</b>, who wrote the original script. Hinds was chosen for his hip-hop knowledge as a former editor-in-chief of <i>The Source</i> magazine, and has also penned an episode of Jordan Peele’s new <i>Twilight Zone</i>.<b> Lakeith Stanfield</b> was originally slated to star, but is no longer part of the project. There are no details yet on how Lee plans to cast the film. <i>Prince of Cats</i> will be produced by <b>Janet and Kate Zucker</b> of Zucker Productions, with Legendary’s Jon Silk and Ali Mendes overseeing for the company.</p>
      <p><i>Prince of Cats</i> sounds like a perfect homecoming of sorts for Lee, who made his name in the 1980s with fiery, bristling films set in Brooklyn like <i>She’s Gotta Have It, Do the Right Thing, Jungle Fever,</i> and more. It will be interesting to see whether he tackles the story with the same energy as his early films, or whether he can bring more of a pathos to it as an older and more established director. But it probably won’t be too somber — there are katanas in this movie after all.</p>
