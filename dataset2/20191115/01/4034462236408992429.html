      <p>With the 2019 LA Auto Show just around the corner, Audi has confirmed it will be premiering two new models in the City of Angels next week. One will be the series production <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/audi/e-tron-suv">Audi e-tron</a> Sportback, which <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/all-electric-audi-sportback-e-tron-bows-in-shanghai">debuted as a concept back in 2017</a> at the Shanghai Auto Show.</p>
      <p>A new teaser photo released by the German automaker shows off the e-tron Sportback's innovative Digital Matrix headlights â€“ a first for a series production vehicle. Using around one million micromirrors, the Digital Matrix headlights can light the way in front of the car with "unprecedented precision."</p>

      <p>Audi has confirmed the e-tron Sportback will share the same powertrain as its SUV sibling, meaning it will have a dual-motor, all-wheel-drive setup delivering 400 horsepower and 490 lb-ft of torque.</p>
      <p>This setup enables the e-tron SUV to accelerate from 0-62 mph in 5.5 seconds before topping out at 124 mph. Visually, the e-tron Sportback will also share design cues with the e-tron SUV, but a sloped roofline will give it a stylish, coupe-like appearance. Production will take place in Brussels alongside the e-tron SUV. Audi will lift the covers off the new e-tron Sportback the evening before the 2019 LA Auto Show on November 19 at 6 pm local time.</p>

      <p>If you prefer combustion-powered SUVs, the new <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/audi/rs-q8">Audi RS Q8</a> - the new high-performance version of the flagship <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/audi/q8">Audi Q8 </a>SUV - will also debut in LA. Specifications haven't been confirmed yet, but Audi promises the hardcore SUV will deliver "epic performance" from an eight-cylinder twin-turbo TFSI engine and a 48-volt mild hybrid system.</p>
      <p>This is likely to be the same engine that powers the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/audi/rs6">Audi RS6 Avant</a>, so expect the RS Q8 to pack around 592 hp. With its belt alternator starter, the RS Q8 can recover up to 12 kW of power to its lithium-ion battery, allowing it to "glide" for up to 40 seconds with the engine switched off at speeds of between 34 and 99 mph. Both the Audi e-tron Sportback and Audi RS Q8 will be on display at the LA Auto Show, which kicks off on November 20.</p>
