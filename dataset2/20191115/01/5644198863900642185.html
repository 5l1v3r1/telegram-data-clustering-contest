      <p>JAKARTA: A strong 7.1-magnitude earthquake hit off the coast of North Maluku province in eastern Indonesia early on Friday (Nov 15), seismologists said, with the US tsunami warning centre saying a tsunami was not expected.</p>
      <p>The quake hit 140 kilometres northwest of the coastal town of Ternate at a depth of 45 kilometres, according to the US Geological Survey.</p>

      <p>The US tsunami warning centre said a "destructive Pacific-wide tsunami is not expected."</p>
      <p>The Indonesian meterological and climatology agency, however, warned people to stay clear of beaches as a precaution.</p>
      <p>The quake was felt strongly in Ternate at 1.17 am local time (1617 GMT), sending sleeping residents fleeing their houses.</p>
      <p>Indonesia experiences frequent seismic and volcanic activity due to its position on the Pacific "Ring of Fire", where tectonic plates collide.</p>
      <p>Last September, a 7.5-magnitude quake and a subsequent tsunami in Palu on Sulawesi island killed more than 2,200, with 1,000 more declared missing.</p>
      <p>On Dec 26, 2004, a 9.1-magnitude earthquake struck Aceh province, causing a tsunami and killing more than 170,000 in Indonesia.</p>
