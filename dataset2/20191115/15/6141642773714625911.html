      <p>England’s 1,000th game brought a big win as they thumped Montenegro 7-0 at Wembley.</p>
      <p>There was also a notable scoring landmark for captain Harry Kane thanks to his first-half hat-trick.</p>
      <p>Here, the PA news agency takes a statistical look at the big occasion.</p>
      <h3>Kane on course for record?</h3>

      <p>He has reached that mark in just 44 caps, leading to talk of him one day overhauling Wayne Rooney as England’s record scorer.</p>
      <p>Rooney’s 53 goals came in 120 caps – Kane, if he keeps up his rate of just over 1.4 games for every goal, is on course to reach the same mark in just his 76th appearance.</p>
      <p>The Tottenham forward also edged ahead of Woodward as England’s highest-scoring captain, with 24 goals in 23 games in the armband – Woodward had 23 in 14.</p>
      <p>Shearer and Bryan Robson scored 20 goals apiece as captain, with David Beckham managing 16 and Rooney alongside David Platt on 14.</p>

      <p>It was the 36th time they had scored seven or more – but only the third in the last 30 years – while only 27 times have they won by such a margin.</p>
      <p>Many of the bigger wins came in the early years of international football, with eight of the seven-goal-plus wins coming before 1900. England also scored seven or more goals six times in the 1960s.</p>
      <h3>No threat to record wins</h3>

      <p>Ireland were on the receiving end again in 1899 in a 13-2 rout at Roker Park – GO Smith scored four but missed England’s first ever penalty, while Jimmy Settle hit a hat-trick.</p>
      <p>Austria were dispatched 11-1 in 1908, Woodward scoring four and Frank Bradshaw three, while the top five is completed by a pair of 10-0 wins.</p>
      <p>Tommy Lawton scored four and Stan Mortensen three against Portugal in 1947, a feat matched by Roger Hunt and Fred Pickering against the United States in 1964.</p>

      <p>Gareth Southgate’s side have beaten Montenegro 5-1 and 7-0 and Bulgaria 4-0 and 6-0, as well as a 5-0 win over the Czech Republic and a wild 5-3 clash against Kosovo. The Czechs won their return fixture 2-1, with Kosovo to come on Monday.</p>
      <p>That makes for 33 goals scored and six conceded in seven games, a goal difference of 27 and a total of 39.</p>
      <p>They have some way to go to match the highest-scoring qualifying campaigns, after the 2008 tournament’s seven- and eight-team groups saw Slovakia score 33 and concede 23, including 7-0 and 5-0 wins over San Marino who scored two and conceded 57. Spain scored 42 and conceded five in only eight Euro 2000 qualifiers.</p>
