      <p>Former <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/">EastEnders</a> star Shaun Williamson has revealed the chilling news that he's being haunted by a ghost.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Shaun, who played infamous Walford "doormat" Barry Evans in the BBC soap as well as a satirical version of himself in Ricky Gervais' Extras, made the startling revelation on Richard Herring's Leicester Square Theatre podcast.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/eastenders-barry-actor-shaun-williamson-haunted-ghost-11162533/">Metro.co.uk</a>, Shaun told shocked listeners that he'd had to call on ghost expert Derek Acorah for advice about the unwelcome guest.</p>
      <aside>Straight away, there were banging noises - we'd got a ghost.</aside>
      <p>He revealed that he and his wife moved into their new house and very quickly started hearing noises, which TV ghosthunter Derek attributed to a poltergeist.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Shaun said: "I was in Celebrity Big Brother with Derek Acorah and I believe he sees and feels everything he believes he sees and feels.</p>
      <p>"We moved into a new house, myself and my current wife Adele. And straight away there were banging noises - we'd got a ghost."</p>
      <p>Shaun then admitted that Derek said the ghost was called Rosemary.</p>

      <p>He added: "We do have a noisy ghost in our house and according to Derek, it's called Rosemary.</p>
      <p>"I do believe the spirits of people linger where they were and all the time there is more evidence of poltergeists."</p>
      <p>While taking part in <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/reality-tv/celebrity-big-brother/">CBB</a> together in 2017, Most Haunted star Derek told Shaun they were 'guided by spirits' when they were in the  house.</p>
      <p>But the spirits sadly didn't help them win, with Shaun evicted by a secret 'back door eviction' just 24 hours before the final and Derek coming in fourth place.</p>

      <p>Soap fans will remember the iconic death of Shaun's character Barry in January 2004, when his spiteful wife Janine pushed him to his death off a cliff and watched him die.</p>
      <p>Not quite as dramatic as <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/eastenders-mel-owen-dies-in-shocking-crash-twist/">Mel Owen's horrific death</a> this week, though!</p>
