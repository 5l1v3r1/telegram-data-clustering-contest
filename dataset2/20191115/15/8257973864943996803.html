      <p>Nov. 15 (UPI) -- The U.S. Navy has awarded Rolls-Royce with a $1.2 billion contract to provide sustainment support for the V-22 AE1107C aircraft engine.</p>
      <p>The deal, announced Thursday by the Department of Defense, covers maintenance and repair of the engines, as well as services to include program management, logistics support and configuration management.</p>
      <p>The V-22 Osprey is a tiltrotor aircraft that combines the vertical performance of a helicopter and speed and range of a fixed-wing aircraft, including the ability to convert to a turboprop plane and accomplish high-speed, high-altitude flight.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Navy <a href="https://www.upi.com/Defense-News/2018/06/01/Rolls-Royce-to-deliver-V-22-Osprey-engines-for-US-military/8321527869627/">in June 2018</a> exercised an option for Rolls-Royce to deliver 15 production AE1107C engines, including seven for the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Marine_Corps/?tps=1">Marine Corps</a>, six for the Navy and two for the Air Force, by May 2019.</p>
      <p>Work on the new contract will be performed in Indianapolis, Ind., and other locations inside and outside the continental U.S., and should be completed in February 2025.</p>
      <p>No funds were obligated at the time of the award, but will be obligated on individual orders as they are issued.</p>
      <p>The contract was not competitively procured. The DoD's contract announcement cites a clause in the U.S. Code stating government contracts can be issued non-competitively if "the property or services needed by the agency are available from only one responsible source or only from a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the agency."</p>
