      <h1>Trump to visit UK in December</h1>
      <h2>US president will meet the queen and take part in NATO summit.</h2>

      <p>U.S. President Donald Trump will visit London in December, ahead of a NATO summit in the capital and before the U.K.'s general election.</p>
      <p>The White House confirmed that Trump will travel to the U.K. on December 2, the day before a two-day <a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_169754.htm">meeting of NATO leaders</a> in Hertfordshire, just outside London, as part of the alliance's 70th anniversary.</p>
      <p>In a statement, the White House said the president "looks forward to meeting" other NATO leaders and would "emphasize the need for the NATO alliance to ensure its readiness for the threats of tomorrow."</p>
      <p>Trump will also attend a reception at Buckingham Palace, which will be hosted by the queen. In 2018, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-claims-queen-elizabeth-kept-him-waiting-uk-us-media/">Trump told supporters</a> that Queen Elizabeth II kept him waiting during his first official visit to the U.K., blaming the media for reporting he'd been the one who was late for their meeting.</p>
      <p>The U.K. holds a general election on December 12. Trump has praised Boris Johnson on numerous occasions and last month <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/trump-brexit-deal-precludes-us-uk-trade-agreement/">told listeners of Nigel Farage's radio show</a> the prime minister was a “fantastic man” and “the exact right guy for the times.”</p>
