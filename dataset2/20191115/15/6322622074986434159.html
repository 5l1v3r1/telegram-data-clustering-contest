      <p>A Klang-based property developer PNSB Acmar Sdn Bhd – a unit of Bandar Baru Klang township developer Acmar Group – has filed a RM711.77 million lawsuit against Prasarana Malaysia Bhd and <b>Sunway Construction Group Bhd</b> (<b>SunCon</b>), claiming the LRT3 project construction works have encroached into its development site.</p>
      <p><b>IOI Corp Bhd</b>'s wholly-owned subsidiary Oleander Capital Resources Pte Ltd is buying a 28% stake each in PT Sawit Nabati Agro (SNA) and PT Berkat Agro Sawitindo (BAS) from Singapore-listed Bumitama Agri Ltd for IDR701 million (approximately US$49,070/RM203,798).</p>

      <p>India’s Supreme Court refused to remove a barrier to the takeover of embattled hospital chain Fortis Healthcare Ltd by Malaysian operator <b>IHH Healthcare Bhd</b>, which is already Fortis’ largest shareholder with a 31% stake.</p>
      <p>The court held Fortis’ founders — Malvinder Singh and Shivinder Singh — guilty of contempt of court and said it could start similar proceedings against the company, according to a judgment Friday.</p>
      <p>This effectively halts IHH’s open offer to Fortis shareholders, that would have brought its holdings in India’s second largest hospital company to above 50%.</p>
