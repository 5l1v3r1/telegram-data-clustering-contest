      <p>If you're a habitual perfume-sprayer, you'll be all too aware of how costly stocking up on your favourite fragrances can be. But thanks to a partnership between a huge high street brand and one of the beauty industry's most celebrated women, your bank balance needn't suffer. <a href="https://www.zara.com/uk/en/woman-event-l1053.html?v1=1281638">Zara and Jo Malone CBE's new fragrance collection</a><b> </b>boasts eight dreamy scents, and it's available online and in stores right now.</p>
      <p>The fashion behemoth and woman behind fragrance brand Jo Loves started working together more than a year ago. Malone told <i>Harper's Bazaar </i>she <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/fragrance/a29798987/jo-malone-zara/">received no brief</a>, deciding to use Zara's archives to inspire each scent. The result —<b> </b>formally named Zara Emotions — comes in three sizes: a 90ml bottle costing £25.95, a smaller 40ml version priced at £15.95, and a £5.95 travel-sized 10ml perfume.</p>
      <p>"Every fragrance has been crafted with personality and a voice to tell its story in a unique fashion," Malone said in a statement. "I hope you enjoy this first collection — it is full of imagination and artistry." Eagle-eyed readers will spot mention of a "first" collection. According to <i>Business of Fashion</i>, Malone and Zara have <a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/news-bites/jo-malone-jo-loves-zara-emotions-fragrance">agreed to a long-term partnership</a>. In fact, Malone is already said to be working on upcoming collections for 2020 and 2021.</p>

      <p>But back to the first lot. The eight fragrances each have enticing names (think <a href="https://www.zara.com/uk/en/-pL1924001.html?v1=34668941&amp;v2=1281638">Vetiver Pamplemousse</a> and <a href="https://www.zara.com/uk/en/-pL1924004.html?v1=35026616&amp;v2=1281638">Amalfi Sunray</a>) and are designed to be worn however you like. So whether that's picking and sticking to your favourite or layering two or more, you have complete and utter freedom.</p>
      <p>Malone describes <a href="https://www.zara.com/uk/en/-pL1924008.html?v1=34670438&amp;v2=1281638">Bohemian Bluebells</a> —<b> </b>an intriguing combination of lavender, sandalwood, and musk — as "like nothing you have ever smelt before," adding: "It’s full of bold, unexpected notes and its vibrant character mesmerises the wearer."</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.zara.com/uk/en/-pL1924003.html?v1=34670436&amp;v2=1281638">Ebony Wood</a>, meanwhile, mixes clove, peppercorn, and, of course, ebony wood for a smell evoking "that moment of freedom and carefree adventures that are about to begin." And then there's <a href="https://www.zara.com/uk/en/-pL1924006.html?v1=34668943&amp;v2=1281638">Fleur D'Oranger</a>: the joining of ylang ylang, neroli, and orange flower that's said to be perfect for "regal" moments.</p>
      <p>Fancy wearing two, but not sure which to pair? Malone <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/fragrance/a29798987/jo-malone-zara/">recommends spritzing Tuberose Noir</a> (ylang ylang, tuberose, and sandalwood) together with Fleur D'Oranger or Bohemian Bluebells with <a href="https://www.zara.com/uk/en/-pL1924007.html?v1=34668944&amp;v2=1281638">Fleur De Patchouli</a> (peony, patchouli, and guaiac wood), per <i>Harper's Bazaar.</i></p>
