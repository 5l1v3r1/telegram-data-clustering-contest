      <p>Youths of the All Progressives Congress in Edo State have vowed not to abandon Governor Godwin Obaseki in his quest to get the party’s ticket for a second term in office.</p>
      <p>The Edo APC youths said they supported former Governor Adams Oshiomhole to have a peaceful eight years in office and as such they would not allow any group or persons to stop Governor Obaseki.</p>
      <p>They said Governor Obaseki has performed beyond expectations in all sectors of the state economy.</p>
      <p>State Youth Leader of the APC, Valentine Asuen, who spoke to newsmen at a press briefing in Bénin City said youths in the state were solidly behind Governor Obaseki because they have benefitted more from the administration.</p>
      <p>Asuen dismissed the purported letter the National Working Committee of the APC relied upon to uphold the suspension of the State Chairman of the party, Barr. Anselm Ojezua.</p>
      <p>The Edo APC Youth Leader stated that he had to sign to remain alive so as to ensure Obaseki gets the second term ticket.</p>
      <p>He urged the APC NWC to disregard the letter saying the signatories were fake as they were obtained under duress.</p>
      <p>He said: “Governor Obaseki has done well in the education sector, health sector, transportation, rule of law and most especially the revenue profile of the state. We are not going to abandon him.</p>
      <p>“It is only in Edo local government can now pay salaries without waiting for money from the federation account. The people fighting him are those that have been feeding from the state revenue.</p>
      <p>“We will not allow them to succeed. We are with Obaseki and will mobilise Edo APC Youths to ensure Obaseki gets the needed support. Edo cannot afford to go back to the days of the locust.”</p>
