      <p>Former Wales coach Warren Gatland revealed he once had suspicions a player within the national squad may have taken drugs – but has no evidence anyone did under his tenure.</p>
      <p>Gatland, 56, stepped down following the Rugby World Cup in Japan, where Wales reached the semi-finals before losing to New Zealand in the bronze medal match.</p>
      <p>The New Zealander had been in charge of Wales since 2007, guiding the squad to four Six Nations titles as well as earning a place at the top of the world rankings.</p>
      <p>Gatland took part in a wide-ranging discussion on the Off The Ball podcast, during which the subject of doping was brought up.</p>

      <p>“The sad thing about professional sport, and whether it’s team sport or individual sport, when money’s involved, there’s that potential for it to be exploited with performance-enhancing drugs,” Gatland said.</p>
      <p>“I think we all want it to stay as clean as we possibly can. I haven’t come across, personally, any players that I’ve coached from a Wales perspective that I would – well sorry, maybe one.”</p>
      <p>The former Wales boss added as he gave a short chuckle: “Yeah, maybe one, now that I think about it.”</p>
      <p>Asked if the person concerned had played for Wales, Gatland replied: “He may have done, yeah.”</p>
      <blockquote>There's always that temptation in players wanting to try and play at a higher level and taking the risks by taking drugs. I definitely don't condone that.<cite>Warren Gatland</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Pressed as to whether he had any misgivings about working with them, the former Wales coach moved to clarify his position.</p>
      <p>Asked if was more of a suspicion over possible doping, Gatland replied: “Yeah, absolutely… and that is the whole time I have been coaching Wales. But I would like to think the sport is clean.</p>
      <p>“From a New Zealand perspective, I think it is pretty clean. When you go down levels we are seeing positives in Wales at junior levels and in other nations as well.</p>
      <p>“There’s always that temptation in players wanting to try and play at a higher level and taking the risks by taking drugs. I definitely don’t condone that.”</p>
      <p>Gatland continued: “It’s probably unfair of me to say I had suspicions because I’ve got no evidence or anything like that.</p>

      <p>“It’s kind of like just saying: ‘is there a possibility?’ It was more like a couple of people making jokes, sort of thing.”</p>
      <p>Asked if it was a case of ‘truth in humour?’, Gatland replied: “Yeah, exactly.”</p>
      <p>The Welsh Rugby Union declined to give any official comment when contacted by the PA news agency.</p>
      <p>It is understood the conversations Gatland recalled during the podcast came from when some Wales players were having a joke about one of their team-mates being in good shape.</p>
      <p>There were never any serious suspicions, because if there had been, the player concerned would have been reported and the relevant disciplinary procedures subsequently followed.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Wales have announced former internationals Byron Hayward and Sam Warburton will join Wayne Pivac’s coaching team.</p>
      <p>Former Wales Under-20 boss Hayward has been appointed defence coach while Warburton, who skippered his country more times than anyone else, has taken on the role of technical advisor breakdown/defence.</p>
      <p>“I’m delighted to bring both Byron and Sam into the set-up and add to what is already a vastly-experienced coaching team,” said head coach Pivac.</p>
      <p>“Both individuals are highly respected, knowledgeable and experienced in their disciplines and will add a great deal to the environment.”</p>
