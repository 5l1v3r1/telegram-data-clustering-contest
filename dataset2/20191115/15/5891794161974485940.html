      <h1>Russian Justice Ministry Declares RFE/RL's Sever.Realii Website 'Foreign Agent'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T15:58:31+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 15:58</time> by <a rel="author">RFE/RL</a></address>
      <p>Russia's Justice Ministry has issued a statement listing RFE/RL's <b><a href="https://www.severreal.org/">Sever.Realii website </a></b>as "foreign mass media performing the functions of a foreign agent."<br/><br/><b><a href="https://minjust.ru/ru/novosti/informacionnyy-resurs-severrealii-vklyuchen-v-reestr-inostrannyh-sredstv-massovoy-informacii">In a statement on its website</a></b>, the ministry said on November 15 that the decision to label the website of RFE/RL's Russian Service that focuses on events in Russia's northwestern regions had been based on conclusions made by the parliamentary committee on an investigation into meddling in the country's internal affairs.<br/><br/>Sever.Realii began operating in September.<br/><br/>A Russian bill enabling the government to designate any foreign media outlet a "foreign agent" was signed by President Vladimir Putin in November 2017.<br/><br/>Just days after that, in December 2017, the Justice Ministry listed Current Time, several RFE/RL services and projects, such as its Russian Service, Tatar-Bashkir Service, Sibir.Realii, Idel.Realii, Factograph, Kavkaz Realii, and Krym.Realii, as well as Voice of America, as "foreign mass media performing the functions of a foreign agent."</p>
      <p>"This 'foreign agent' designation is politically motivated and targets RFE/RL's Sever.Realii unit for northwestern Russia, as it has been used to target other RFE/RL Russian-speaking services," RFE/RL President Jamie Fly said in a statement. "It is an attempt to silence independent media in Russia and deprive Russian audiences of access to information that is not under Kremlin control. U.S. law guarantees RFE/RL's editorial independence. Any suggestion that we or our journalists are agents of any government is false."</p>
      <p>Russian officials have said the law is a "symmetrical response" after Russia's state-funded channel RT -- which U.S. authorities accuse of spreading propaganda -- was required to register its U.S. operating unit under the U.S. Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA).<br/><br/>U.S. officials have said the action is not symmetrical, arguing that the U.S. and Russian laws are different and that Russia uses its "foreign-agent" legislation to silence dissent and discourage a free exchange of ideas.</p>
