      <p>After it was last held in 2013, Joyland Festival is set to return in December, bringing with it a long-awaited international line-up such as United States musician Frankie Cosmos, US chill-wave pioneer Washed Out, and Canadian indie rock unit TOPS.</p>
      <p>The festival will be held on Dec. 7-8 at Panahan Field, Gelora Bung Karno sports complex, Central Jakarta.</p>
      <p>Aside from international headliners, Indonesian talent will also join the event as performers and curators.</p>
      <p>“This year we’ve asked Efek Rumah Kaca, Soleh Solihun and Anggun Priambodo to curate the music, stand-up comedy and film,” Joyland Festival program director Ferry Dermawan said in a statement made available for <i>The Jakarta Post</i>.</p>
      <p>Efek Rumah Kaca has chosen several musical acts to play at one of the festival's areas named Lilypad, Ferry said. Among the acts are Jirapah, Puti Chitara, Mad Mad Men and Sir Dandy -- all have performed at Kios Ojo Keos, a mini establishment managed by Efek Rumah Kaca. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Soleh Solihun has invited comedians such as Yusril Ihza Fahriza, Oki Rengga, Ali Akbar, Awwe, Aci Resti, Kiky Saputri, Eka Kuota and Nury Zhafira to put on a comic show at a corner named Shrooms Garden.</p>
