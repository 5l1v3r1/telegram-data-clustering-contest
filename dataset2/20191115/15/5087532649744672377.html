      <h1>Apple TV+ Guide: All of the Original Video Content [Update]</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T15:06:35+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 15:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macobserver.com/author/andrew-orr/" target="_blank">Andrew Orr</a></address>
      <p>Apple is spending billions on TV shows and series. We’ve put together an Apple TV+ guide for all of the original content that the company has right now, and will have in the future. We learned during the March 2019 keynote that the content will be available this fall. The list will be updated continuously, so be sure to bookmark this page.</p>
      <h3>Truth Be Told</h3>
      <p>One of the new shows coming, Apple is working with Reece Witherspoon’s production company Hello Sunshine. Based on the novel <i>Are You Sleeping</i> by Kathleen Barber. The show will star Octavia Spencer. Apple has <a href="https://www.macobserver.com/news/apple-are-you-sleeping-tv-series/">officially signed</a> a 10-episode season. Actors <a href="https://www.macobserver.com/link/are-you-sleeping-cast/">will include</a> Lizzy Caplan, Aaron Paul, Ron Cephas Jones, Elizabeth Perkins, Mekhi Phifer, Michael Beach, Tracie Thoms, and Haneefah Wood.</p>
      <h3>Amazing Stories</h3>
      <p>Apple is working with Steven Spielberg to bring back his Amazing Stories series, which ran for two seasons in the 1980s. So far Apple has committed to 10 episodes, with Bryan Fuller as showrunner.</p>
      <h3>The Morning Show</h3>
      <p>Reece Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston will star in a as-yet-untitled drama. It’s not a morning talk show, but a drama <i>about creating</i> a morning talk show. Apple has committed to two seasons of 10 episodes, each lasting an hour. The writer and executive producer is Jay Carson, who previously produced <i>House of Cards</i>.</p>

It will be a documentary series produced by Matt Tyrnauer and Corey Reeser.</p>

      <h3>Kristen Wiig Comedy</h3>
      <p>Under Apple, Kristen Wiig will star in her own <a href="https://www.macobserver.com/news/kristen-wiig-will-star-comedy-series-apple-reese-witherspoon-executive-produce/">comedy series</a>. It will be created and produced by Colleen McGuinness. Apple has committed to one season of 10 episodes, each lasting a half hour. The series doesn’t have a title yet.</p>
      <h3>Vital Signs</h3>
      <p><i>Vital Signs</i> will be a miniseries produced by Dr. Dre. Each episode will focus on a specific emotion, and will be a semi-autobiographical story of Dr. Dre’s life. The miniseries was originally rumored to be released in August. Since it hasn’t, we don’t know if Apple canceled the project or is holding onto it for a future release.</p>
      <h3>Drama by Damien Chazelle</h3>
      <p>Director Damien Chazelle (La La Land) will write and produce every episode of a <a href="https://www.macobserver.com/news/apple-just-committed-straight-series-order-damien-chazelle/">new drama series</a> for Apple. There are no details yet, but the series will be executive produced by Jordan Horowitz and Fred Berger.</p>
      <h3>Little America</h3>
      <p>Apple originally considered the series back in February as a straight-to-series production, and now it’s past consideration and <a href="https://www.macobserver.com/news/little-america-immigrant-anthology/">officially under the Apple brand</a>. Written by Emily V. Gordon, Lee Eisenberg, and Kumail Nanjiani, <i>Little America</i> is inspired by true stories featured in <i>Epic Magazine</i>.</p>
