      <p>New game announcements from Obsidian, Rare, and Dontnod highlighted Microsoft’s Inside Xbox presentation at X019, the company’s annual fan festival taking place in London this weekend. It also showed several updates and new trailers for previously announced games, as well as new content coming to Project xCloud and Xbox Game Pass — including 10 <i>Final Fantasy</i> games.</p>
      <h3>Obsidian’s Grounded enters early access this summer.</h3>
      <p>The next game from Obsidian is all about sandbox survival — literally. You’re a group of kids who’ve been shrunk down to tiny size and have to survive in a suburban backyard and not get eaten by spiders or whatever else might destroy a tiny one-centimetre person in Anytown, USA. It’ll launch into early access via Xbox Game Preview on Xbox One and PC (including on Steam) this autumn, with a full launch in 2020.</p>

      <h3>Dontnod’s Tell Me Why will be available this winter.</h3>
      <p>The creators of <i>Life Is Strange</i> are back with another story-driven adventure game, created in partnership with Xbox Game Studios. <i>Tell Me Why</i> stars a pair of siblings, one of whom is a transgender man; the studio has worked alongside the advocacy organisation GLAAD to deliver what it calls an “authentic representation of the trans experience.” The three-episode game will be released in full this summer on Xbox One and PC (including Steam).</p>
      <h3>Rare’s Everwild will probably come out at some point.</h3>
      <p>The next game from the storied developer of <i>Sea of Thieves</i> and <i>Anticipation</i> is called <i>Everwild</i>, and that’s about all we know about it at this point. The trailer showed what seemed to be a group of player characters cooperatively exploring a colourful world full of wildlife. Rare said it is “focused on building an experience that allows for new ways to play in a natural and magical world.”</p>

      <h3>Final Fantasy games (and more) are coming to Game Pass.</h3>
      <p>Not <i>today</i> or anything, but at some point between now and the end of 2020, <i>Final Fantasies</i> 7, 8, 9, 10, 10-2, 12, all three of the 13s, and 15 will be on Game Pass. Also arriving at some point in that big wide window are <i>Streets of Rage 4</i>, <i>My Friend Pedro</i>, <i>The Witcher 3</i>, and… look, it’s a lot. A handful of other games, including the new Definitive Edition of <i>Age of Empires II</i> and <i>Rage 2</i>, are available today. Microsoft will also bring xCloud game streaming to Xbox Game Pass next year.</p>
