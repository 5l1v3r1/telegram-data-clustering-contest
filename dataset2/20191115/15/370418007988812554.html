      <p>Following the release of <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/panic-at-the-disco/">Panic! At The Disco</a>’s spectacular take on <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/panic-at-the-disco-have-released-a-song-for-the-frozen-2-soundtrack/">Into The Unknown</a> from the Frozen 2 soundtrack, <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/weezer/">Weezer</a> have now unveiled their cover for the smash Disney franchise.</p>
      <p>Rivers Cuomo and co.’s touching rendition of Lost In The Words is performed by Jonathan Groff (the friendly iceman Kristoff) in the movie, but the Weezer-ed up version actually appears alongside Panic! and Kacey Musgraves’ covers in the end credits. All three songs are available now as part of the Frozen 2 soundtrack, which you can grab right <a href="https://frozen2.lnk.to/OSTPR">here</a> if you’re a fan of the animated musical sensation.</p>

      <p>“While we can’t wait for the world to hear these songs, we feel like we got a sneak peek of how people will react with how quickly our end credits artists signed on,” says executive music producer Tom MacDougall, who won a GRAMMY for the first movie’s soundtrack. “Their excitement for this franchise and these songs is represented in their wildly creative takes on each of their versions.”</p>
