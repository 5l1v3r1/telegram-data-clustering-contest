      <p>Sky Sports is back for the 2019-20 season with 128 Premier League games. With the launch of individual sports channels on Sky TV, it's never been easier to watch or stream Sky Sports live.</p>
      <p>Although you won't be able to see every football game on TV with Sky Sports, so make sure you check out our feature on the best <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/deals/82593/the-best-bt-sport-deals-and-tv-packages-for-august-2019">BT Sport deals for the 2019-20 Premier League season</a>.</p>

      <p>There are two options for existing Sky customers if you want to upgrade to Sky Sports. Sky Sports packages include coverage of 128 live Premier League games throughout 2019/20, alongside over 170 EFL and 30 Scottish Premiership games, all in HD.</p>
      <h4>Black Friday Sky TV Offer</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bdgh">50% off Sky TV Packages</a> -<b> Includes Sky Sports</b></li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can either opt for the Football and Premier League package, now only £18 per month. Or, you can go big and buy into the total package, which includes every Sky Sports channel.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/b0r4">Premier League and Football</a> - <b>£15 p/m</b></li>
        <li><a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/b0r4">Every Sky Sports Channel</a> - <b>£23 p/m for 18 months</b></li>
      </ul>
      <p>There's no limit to how long you need to subscribe to the football channels. You can sign up on a rolling monthly basis, meaning you can cancel Sky Sports in the off-season months, if you wish.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, if you commit to taking Sky Sports for 18 months, you can get every channel for £23 per month, only £5 more than just going for one channel.</p>
      <h4>Sky Sports for new Sky customers</h4>
      <hr/>
      <p>Sky are currently running a package deal that bundles every Sky Sports channel, in full HD, and a new Sky Q box <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/b0q5?or=https%3A%2F%2Fuk.icms.pcmag.com%2Fadmin%2Farticle%2F82506%2F1%2F%3Finline">for only £42 per month</a>.</p>
      <p>The deal includes every Sky Sports channel and will give you access to the 128 Premier League games this season. This is cheaper then buying the packages separately, and highly recommended.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/b0q5?or=https%3A%2F%2Fuk.icms.pcmag.com%2Fadmin%2Farticle%2F82506%2F1%2F%3Finline">Sky Sports Bundle</a> - <i>was £50 p/m</i>, <b>now £42 p/m, £20 upfront</b></li>
        <li><a href="http://r.zdbb.net/u/6y8y?or=https%3A%2F%2Fuk.icms.pcmag.com%2Fadmin%2Farticle%2F82593%2F1%2F%3Finline">Sky Q 1TB Box</a> - <b>£22 p/m for 18 months, £20 upfront</b></li>
      </ul>
      <p>The base price for a new Sky Q box is £22 p/m which includes the entertainment package for Sky as standard. Standard installation for the 1TB box is currently only £20 as well.</p>
      <p>After this you can add on whatever other services you desire. You can choose from Sky Sports, Cinema, On-Demand, and Kids. If you want to have Sky around the home, there's a £13 extra monthly fee to pay on-top, alongside the cost for the Sky Q mini boxes, currently £50 each.</p>

      <p>There isn't as much flexibility with Virgin for new customers if you're looking to pick up a sports package, as these are your options.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/b0qf?or=https%3A%2F%2Fuk.icms.pcmag.com%2Fadmin%2Farticle%2F82506%2F1%2F%3Finline">Bigger Bundle + Sports</a> - <b>£65 p/m for 12 months, £35 upfront</b></li>
        <li><a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/b0r2">Ultimate Oomph Bundle</a> - <b>£99 p/m for 12 months, £35 upfront</b></li>
      </ul>
      <p>But, existing Virgin customers can <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/b0r3">upgrade their package</a> to include Sky Sports for an extra <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/b0r3">£7 per month</a> on-top of the current rate.</p>
