      <h1>Got to make them pay for let-off: Mayank</h1>

      <p>While some of his teammates were having a net session under lights with the pink ball after stumps on the second day, Mayank Agarwal addressed the media with a content look.</p>
      <p>Having ground his way through the domestic system to earn his maiden Test cap, he wasn’t excited at scoring his second double hundred in as many series. The opening batsman showed no signs of fatigue, even after batting for almost four sessions while plundering 243 runs against Bangladesh, indicating his fitness regime.</p>
      <p>Excerpts from his interaction:</p>
      <p>
        <b>On whether he thanked Imrul Kayes for dropping him on the first evening</b>
      </p>
      <p>That’s not in my control but I was thinking that if I have got a chance, I have got to make them pay. When you get a let-off, you make sure that you make them pay.</p>
      <p>
        <b>On his mindset to play long innings</b>
      </p>
      <p>I think it goes down to understanding that there had been times when I have not got runs, so I must respect that I am batting well. When I am doing that I have to make sure that I make it big and put the team in the driver’s seat or in such a position that they cannot lose from there.</p>
      <p>
        <b>On his thoughts when he was given lbw paddle-sweeping before it was overturned through DRS</b>
      </p>
      <p>Initially when I was hit on the pads, I thought I wasn’t out. But then when I was given out, I had a quick flashback. I got out the same way to Roston Chase in the West Indies, so I said I can’t make that mistake again. I am glad and happy that (replays showed) it was missing (the stumps). At some point I thought, may be it will be umpires call and I will be doomed.</p>
      <p>
        <b>On reaching the double with a six</b>
      </p>
      <p>I was not thinking of that. I was thinking to give 4-5 overs and go 1, 1, 1, 1 unless something was in my half. Because I was batting on 196, I was confident. I got one in my slot and I hit it for six.</p>
      <p>
        <b>On how he unwinds in the evenings after a superb knock</b>
      </p>
      <p>I play PUBG.</p>
