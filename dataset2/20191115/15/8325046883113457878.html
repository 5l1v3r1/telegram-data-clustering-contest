      <p>US factory output plummeted the most since April as the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gm-workers-ratify-new-contract-ending-longest-strike-50-years-2019-10">40-day General Motors strike</a> dragged on the crucial automotive sector.</p>
      <p>Manufacturing output dropped 0.6% in October after falling 0.5% the previous month, according to a <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/Current/default.htm">Friday release</a> from the Federal Reserve. Output of motor vehicles and parts plummeted 7.1% last month as members of the United Auto Workers union walked out of factories in a strike to demand improved contracts.</p>
      <p>Total industrial production fell roughly 0.8% in October, its biggest decline since May 2018.</p>
      <p>Excluding motor vehicles and parts, factory production fell only 0.1% in October, the same decrease seen in September. The <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/gm-stock">GM</a> strike lasted from September 16 to October 25, and cost the automaker nearly $3 billion.</p>
      <p>Roughly 49,000 UAW workers went on strike across 55 GM facilities to secure low-cost healthcare, wage increases, quicker access to full-time status for temporary workers, and increased profit-sharing. The workers ratified a new, four-year contract to end the strike in October.</p>
      <p>“We are all so incredibly proud of UAW-GM members who captured the hearts and minds of a nation,” UAW Vice President Terry Dittes said in a statement following the contract’s ratification. “Their sacrifice and courageous stand addressed the two-tier wages structure and permanent temporary worker classification that has plagued working-class Americans.”</p>
      <p>GM also announced it would build an electric truck in an “unallocated” Detroit plant, and that it plans to build a new battery factory near an idled plant in Ohio.</p>
      <p>UAW’s new contract is now being used as a template for negotiations with Ford and other US automakers.</p>
