      <h3>What you need to know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Project Scarlett is Microsoft's upcoming next-generation console.</li>
        <li>It launches in Holiday 2020 and will be competitive with the PlayStation 5.</li>
        <li>Microsoft doesn't want to make the same mistakes it did with the Xbox One launch.</li>
        <li>Additionally, Spencer said Project xCloud wouldn't come to Stadia because it's a closed platform.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/xbox-project-scarlett-specs">Project Scarlett</a> is Microsoft's upcoming Xbox console, and it's going to focus on 4K resolution or 120 frames per second gameplay. While we don't know the exact specifications of the device, we do know that it's coming in Holiday 2020. In an interview with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/14/20965239/xbox-project-scarlett-price-performance-ps5-phil-spencer-interview">The Verge</a>, Xbox's Phil Spencer provided more details about what he hopes the console will be.</p>
      <p>An excerpt from Spencer can be read below.</p>
      <blockquote>I would say a learning from the Xbox One generation is we will not be out of position on power or price. If you remember the beginning of this generation we were a hundred dollars more expensive and yes, we were less powerful. And we started Project Scarlett with this leadership team in place with a goal of having market success... We had the discussion years ago 'do we want to go do another generation?' Yes, and do we think there will be multiple generations ahead of us? I actually think there probably is. So we're going all in. We're all-in on Project Scarlett and I want to compete, and I want to compete in the right ways which is why we're focused on cross-play and backward compatibility.</blockquote>
      <p>It seems like Microsoft learned its lesson from the disastrous <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/xbox-one-s">Xbox One</a> launch. The company has to offer a powerful console at an affordable price point.</p>
      <p>The Verge also asked Spencer if <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/project-xcloud">Project xCloud</a>, the company's game streaming service, would ever be available on Google Stadia. Spencer said that he wants the "full" Xbox experience there, not just games. You can read another excerpt from Spencer below.</p>
      <blockquote>So do we want that Xbox experience to be available in other places? Yeah, we're doing xCloud and other things, but it would have to be a full experience. It's hard to think about those things on platforms that are... more closed than the at scale open platforms of phones and PCs that are out there today.</blockquote>
      <p>There you have it, the only way Stadia would support Project xCloud would be if it allowed the "Game Streaming" app available on Android phones. This is probably not going to happen because the two companies are in direct competition with one another when it comes to cloud gaming.</p>
      <p>What do you want to see from Project Scarlett and Project xCloud in the future? Let us know.</p>
