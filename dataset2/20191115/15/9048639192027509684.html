      <p><b>(CNN) - </b>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned that Dollar Tree may be selling "potentially unsafe drugs" and cosmetics.</p>
      <p>In a Nov. 6 letter to the retailer, the FDA cited Chinese manufacturers that didn't test products. It also mentioned a facility where rodent feces were found.</p>
      <p>According to the agency, between 2016 and this year, Dollar Tree was notified of warning letters sent to manufacturers the company has relationships with.</p>
      <p>A company executive said in a statement to CNBC that the drugs the FDA mentions are products that are applied to the body, not ingested.</p>
      <p>The executive said in the statement Dollar Tree is committed to customer safety and plans to meet with the FDA soon.</p>
      <p>The FDA has instructed Dollar tree to respond to the letter within 15 days and to detail what they've done to address their violations.</p>
