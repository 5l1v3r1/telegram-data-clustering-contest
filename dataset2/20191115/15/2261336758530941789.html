      <h1>Darren Till pokes at Robert Whittaker for fight in London, former UFC champ responds</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T15:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 15:00</time> by <a rel="author">Milan Ordoñez</a></address>
      <p>Since dropping the UFC middleweight title to Israel Adesanya at UFC 244 last month, Robert Whittaker is now setting his sights Darren Till. “The Reaper” has had <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/5/20949857/ufc-244-mma-news-darren-till-robert-whittaker-darren-till-kelvin-gastelum-beautiful-fight">nothing but complimentary words</a> towards Till, who won his 185-pound debut against Kelvin Gastelum at UFC 244.</p>
      <p>Whittaker also said that a matchup with “The Gorilla” is the only fight he’s looking at as of the moment. In fact, he wants the fight to happen in Till’s home country in England in 2020.</p>
      <p>“That’s the fight I’m currently interested in,” <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/9/20955907/robert-whittaker-calls-out-darren-till-match-up-currently-interested-ufc-mma-news">Whittaker said</a> of facing Till. “Plus I’ve never been to Europe before, so what better reason to go?”</p>
      <p>The feeling is apparently mutual with Till, who issued his own callout towards the former champion.</p>

      <p>When he seemingly didn’t get an immediate response, he continued to prod at Whittaker.</p>

      <p>Hours later, Whittaker eventually responded in agreement.</p>

      <p>The UFC’s annual London event usually takes place in March. Till also headlined this year’s card against Jorge Masvidal, where he lost via second-round knockout.</p>
