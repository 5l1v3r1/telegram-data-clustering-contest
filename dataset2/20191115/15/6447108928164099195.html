      <h1>Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC works now…. mostly</h1>
      <h2>OK cowboy.</h2>

      <p>If you’ve been following my journeys in the wild wild west (what a weird film that was), then you’ll know that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/11/06/red-dead-redemption-2-pc-launch-review-problems-bugs-issues-fixes/">I wasn’t having the best time</a> of things at launch. Thankfully, things have changed pretty quickly since last week. The first thing that got patched was the Rockstar Launcher, which seemed to fix the problems for a few people trying to even get at the game, though not everyone. Red Dead Redemption 2 has also been patched multiple times in the last week, and things are now looking up for this particular port. Rather than being as stuttery as a teenager on a first date, RDR2 has become altogether smoother, suaver, and much, <i>much</i> better at keeping itself in one piece.</p>

      <p>The world no longer chugs by one frame at a time on my PC, but flows like a great river carving its way through the parched lands of these lawless lands. Or something. Basically, it all works pretty well now. The game no longer freezes up at the mere sight of a firebomb (boy, was using that a mistake!) and you can safely assume that if you set out on a journey that you’ll probably make it to your end goal. That’s assuming you don’t get jumped by bandits of course, but that isn’t Rockstar’s fault. Well, it is, but you know what I mean.</p>
      <p>There are still a few lingering problems for those of us with Nvidia cards, like myself. Rockstar has put out <a href="https://support.rockstargames.com/articles/360038940333/Graphics-stuttering-or-stalling-in-Red-Dead-Redemption-2-on-PC">some helpful advice</a> if you’re still finding the game stuttering whenever you try to do something. In fact, they put out a tweet containing a whole bunch of text that explains that they’re now working with Nvidia to try and solve the issue, which is good to know.</p>
      <p>You can read the full text here:</p>

      <p>The response time through this has actually been quite reassuring, and it should mean that we’ll all be able to wander around the vast world of Red Dead Redemption 2 without glaring technical issues in the near future, maybe by the end of the month. That is, assuming nothing untoward happens due to all of the patching, hotfixing and driver updating.</p>
      <p>That means the game will become the same one we <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/10/25/red-dead-redemption-2-review/">reviewed</a> last year, which means it should once again be worthy of this quote:</p>
      <p>“The hype being created for Red Dead Redemption 2 and the expectations of the passionate fan-base made a part of me believe that Rockstar Games could never deliver on all of their many promises. They did, and then some. From the feeling of a realistic living world they’ve created to the emotional bonds you build, Red Dead Redemption 2 is the video game experience of this generation.”</p>

      <p>So that’s nice to know. See, being patient can sometimes be a good thing. Sometimes shouting at whoever is in charge of the company Twitter accounts isn’t really necessary because the game is already being fixed. Ah, to live in a world where Twitter wasn’t so toxic for people who create games for a living? I mean, I guess that’s the kind of escapist fantasy you can live out in the vast plains and rocky mountainsides of Red Dead Redemption 2. You were worried I was getting off track there, but I brought it back.</p>
