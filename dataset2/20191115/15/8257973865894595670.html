      <h1>U.S., South Korea agree on military costs; lawmakers slam 'excessive' demands</h1>

      <p>Nov. 15 (UPI) -- The United States and South Korean military agreed in a joint statement signed Friday to include a clause on the "importance of cost sharing" among allies.</p>
      <p>The statement of the 51st Security Consultative Meeting made public on Friday included the cost-sharing clause, reflecting U.S. demands that Seoul pay more for the troop presence on the peninsula, South Korean news service MoneyToday reported.</p>
      <p>U.S. Defense Secretary <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Mark-Esper/?tps=1">Mark Esper</a> and South Korean Defense Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo agreed on 23 provisions in the joint statement, an increase from 19 clauses in 2018, according to the report.</p>
      <p>Esper told reporters in Seoul since South Korea is a "rich country" it can afford to pay more, and should pay more.</p>
      <p>Esper also said it is "very important" South Korea's contributions increase by the end of the year; the language regarding the cost increase was toned down in the joint statement, however, according to MoneyToday.</p>
      <p>The Trump administration's demands for a five-fold increase in South Korea's defense burden sharing has triggered complaints in Seoul's National Assembly.</p>
      <p>Yonhap reported Friday 47 politicians of left and center-left parties have signed a statement condemning the Trump administration's "bluffing" and its request Seoul pay as much as $4.7 billion in defense costs for troops on and beyond the peninsula.</p>
      <p>Politicians including Chung Dong-young, a former minister of unification, signed the statement. Suggestions that U.S. troops can be withdrawn from the peninsula unless demands for a five-fold increase in contributions are met represents a "serious threat," the group said.</p>
      <p>The lawmakers also said South Korea is providing the "world's largest U.S. military base overseas" with 14.7 million square meters of land, and that South Korea covered $18 billion in costs to build the base in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province. The group added of South Korean contributions to U.S. defense costs, $1.14 billion was left unused until late 2018.</p>
      <p>A third round of negotiations of the Special Measures Agreement on cost-sharing is scheduled for Monday, according to Tongil News.</p>
