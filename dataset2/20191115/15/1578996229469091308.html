      <h1>Chrissy Teigen Scared John Legend on the Ellen Show, and It Drained Her</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T15:53:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 15:53</time> by <a rel="author">Alyssa Bailey</a></address>
      <p><i>People</i>'s sexiest man alive John Legend guest-hosted the Ellen DeGeneres Show this week, so naturally the Ellen team arranged for his wife Chrissy Teigen to scare him. She popped out and cussed at him, he looked terrified for a split second and then returned to his mellow self.</p>
      <p>Teigen explained what went into the scare and how exhausting it was. It took more out of her than it did Legend. "Hardest thing I’ve ever done! I didn’t mean to swear, I’m so sorry. Should we do it again?" she immediately said after.</p>
      <p>"You didn’t tell tell me you were going to be here," Legend told her.</p>
      <p>"Honestly, I’m so exhausted," she said, literally exasperated.</p>
      <p>"How long were you stuck under there?" he asked.</p>
      <p>"A long time," she replied. Legend helped her out, and she explained that "they made me be bare foot. I’m honestly so tired. Sorry."</p>
      <p>Teigen later asked him, "You didn’t hear me banging around the box?"</p>
      <p>"No, I did not," Legend answered.</p>
      <p>"This helps because he’s very unaware of anything around him," Teigen explained to the crowd. "Like we get in fights on the airplane and stuff. He’ll hit people with his bag. And I’m like apologize!"</p>
      <p>The two bantered a little more about Legend's unawareness giving her a good opportunity to cheat without him knowing, and then Legend worked his <i>People's </i>Sexiest Man Alive title into their joking back and forth. These two ought to co-host next time.</p>
