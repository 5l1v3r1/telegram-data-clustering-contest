      <h1>Some people really want Elsa to come out in 'Frozen 2'</h1>
      <h2>New female character raises hopes</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T15:45:42+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 15:45</time> by <a rel="author">Lisa Respers France, CNN</a></address>
      <p>(CNN) - Speculation over Elsa's sexuality is ramping up in anticipation of "Frozen II."</p>
      <p>Yes, people actually are interested in whether the Disney character is gay.</p>
      <p>Here's the back story: In 2016, Twitter got behind a #GetElsaAGirlfriend campaign for the sequel to the hit 2013 film.</p>
      <p>When t<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2019/02/13/entertainment/frozen-2-trailer/index.html">he first trailer for "Frozen II" dropped in February 2019</a>, some were convinced that the character of Iduna, voiced by Evan Rachel Wood, was the ice queen's new love interest.</p>
      <p>The theory got even bigger once social media started circulating a story by NPC Daily headlined "IT'S OFFICIAL: Disney announces Elsa will be a lesbian in Frozen 2" in March.</p>
      <p>The problem was NPC Daily is a satire site and the story is totally not true.</p>
      <p>But that hasn't stopped people from hoping. Elsa's struggle to come to terms with her powers in "Frozen" marked her as both a feminist and an outsider. And she doesn't have the prince boyfriend that's typical of these kinds of characters.</p>
      <p>For the record, Disney never has addressed Elsa's, or any of the other character's, sexuality.</p>
      <p>And don't look to the woman who voices Elsa, actress Idina Menzel, to be able to tell us either.</p>
      <p>In 2015, Menzel awkwardly had to let it go during a talk show appearance after she tried to talk about whether Elsa was looking for a "gentleman friend." A video of the appearance made the rounds on social media.</p>
      <p>What we do know is that "Frozen II" hits theaters November 22 and it looks to be intense.</p>
      <p>As for whom Elsa loves, we are sure the wondering never bothered her anyway.</p>
