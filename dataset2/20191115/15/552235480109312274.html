      <h1>Judges throw out Steven Donaldson's killers appeal over 'excessive sentences'</h1>
      <h2>Tasmin Glass and Callum Davidson hoped to have their sentences reduced in court just hours after a third killer, Steven Dickie, was found dead inside his prison cell.</h2>

      <p>A woman who lured an oil worker to his death and her murdering accomplice lost <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/steven-donaldsons-ex-girlfriend-appeals-16515287">appeals</a> against jail sentences imposed on them as the third killer was found dead in his cell at a Perth prison.</p>
      <p>Tasmin Glass, 20, and Callum Davidson, 24, had complained the jail sentences imposed on them were excessive, but their legal challenges were rejected by judges at the Court of Criminal Appeal in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> .</p>
      <p>Davidson and Steven Dickie, 24, were jailed for life for murdering <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/bikers-procession-pays-tribute-alleged-12969330">Steven Donaldson</a> at a nature reserve in Angus in June 2018.</p>
      <p>Glass, who also originally faced a murder charge, was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment after she was convicted of the lesser offence of culpable homicide for her role in the brutal killing of her former boyfriend.</p>

      <p>Steven Donaldson, from Arbroath, was <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/cops-hunt-three-men-range-12684106">found dead</a> at a car park at Kinnordy Nature Reserve, near Kirriemuir, on June 7 last year after he was subjected to "extreme violence" by Dickie and Donaldson.</p>
      <p>The trial judge, Lord Pentland, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/watch-moment-steven-donaldson-killers-16228379">told both men</a> that they were "cold-blooded, violent and unrepentant".</p>
      <p>They armed themselves with a baseball bat, knife and a cleaver or axe before overpowering Donaldson at the Peter Pan playpark in Kirriemuir where he had gone to meet Glass.</p>
      <p>He was then abducted and taken to the nature reserve where he tried to escape before being cut down without mercy. His spinal chord was severed and his body left next to his car, which was set on fire.</p>
      <p>Davidson was ordered to serve a minimum term of 24 years before he can apply for parole under a life sentence and Dickie was told he would be in jail for at least 23 years during a life sentence, following a trial at the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/courts">High Court</a> in Edinburgh earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Davidson's counsel, Brian McConnachie QC, told appeal judges that the 24 year minimum term, known as a punishment part, was "excessive" and resulted in a miscarriage of justice.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>He pointed out that in a major previous appeal case on sentencing in murder cases it was indicated 16 years was the starting point for such offences involving the use of a knife.</p>
      <p>"Having regard to his age in the sense that he is still a relatively young man, the fact that while he had a record, it was not by any manner of means the worst this court has seen, to impose a punishment part, not just in excess of what effectively is the minimum also half as much again, is, in my submission, excessive." he said.</p>
      <p>The QC added that although there was a degree of planning involved in the crime there was not "significant premeditation".</p>
      <p>Gordon Jackson QC said there was no basis in the evidence at the trial for finding that Glass had any knowledge of a knife.</p>
      <p>"There is no basis to conclude that she knew about the weapons, other than the baseball bat," he said.</p>
      <p>"We know, as a matter of fact, what resulted in the death of the deceased was not an assault with a baseball bat," he said.</p>
      <p>He added that Glass was a first offender and it was considered she was unlikely to re-offend.</p>
      <p>Lord Brodie, who heard the appeals with Lord Drummond Young and Lord Turnbull, said the court would give its full reasons in writing later.</p>

      <p>He said: "However, we have been able to come to a conclusion in relation to each appeal."</p>
      <p>He said that taking account of the circumstances of the offence and the offender in Davidson's case and everything said on his behalf they were not satisfied that the 24 year term was excessive.</p>
      <p>Lord Brodie said in the case of Glass: "We have concluded the sentence was not excessive and was within the scope of the sentencing judge's discretion."</p>
      <p>Both appeals were refused.</p>

      <p>The news of the appeal rejection comes just hours after Steven Dickie was <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/man-convicted-murdering-steven-donaldson-20887952">found dead</a> inside his prison cell at HMP Perth on Friday morning.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-prison-service">Scottish Prison Service</a> have launched a probe as the cause of his death remains unclear.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the SPS said: "Steven Alexander Dickie, 24, a prisoner at HMP Perth has died.</p>
      <p>"He was convicted at Edinburgh Court on 30 May 2019. Police Scotland have been advised and the matter reported to the Procurator Fiscal.</p>
      <p>"A Fatal Accident Inquiry will be held in due course."</p>
