      <p>A Mini left abandoned in a flooded Derbyshire road has had its windows smashed and sides damaged.</p>
      <p>The car was left abandoned on a country lane between Swarkestone Bridge and Ingleby, earlier this week.</p>
      <p>An earlier picture showed how water had risen up onto its wheels, just underneath the numberplate.</p>
      <p>New dashcam footage shows how the car has now been damaged on the front and side panel.</p>
      <p>The driver window has also been broken since it was left in the road. The back light has also been damaged.</p>
      <p>Flooding has led to several road closures and train cancellations across the county.</p>
      <p>Flood warnings, meaning flooding is expected and immediate action is required, are in place on the River Trent at Sawley, the River Derwent at Church Wilne and the River Erewash at Langley Mill and Ilkeston.</p>
      <p>Several replacement bus services have been put in place in between Derby and Nottingham throughout the day in a bid to keep commuters on the move.</p>
      <p>Flooding continues to cause problems and we have a live blog running as the events of the day unfold.</p>
