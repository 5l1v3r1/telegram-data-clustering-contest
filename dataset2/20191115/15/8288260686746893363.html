      <p>Most of Liverpool's regulars are expected to head to Doha with <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/fans-been-sent-warning-ahead-17262680">an inexperienced side likely to travel to the Midlands</a> - while <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/dean-smith">Dean Smith</a> also has a packed schedule to contend with.</p>

      <p>This is in line with the pricing structure for category C Premier League matches at home but plenty of supporters think it’s too much to pay.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Here’s what they have been saying:</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Elie Ward -</b> You’re charging us this and Liverpool £20 max? Unfair and overcharging fans of the club! Bad form.</p>
      <p><b>Spence Browne -</b> Kids and oaps same price as adults, shocking.</p>
      <p><b>Alice -</b> Gunna have a stadium full of Liverpool tourists with those prices.</p>
      <p><b>Max Stokes -</b> Ridiculous prices lads.</p>
      <p><b>Kieran -</b> OK now show the real prices.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><b>Jake -</b> The state of those prices. In my opinion £20’s a push for this fixture with the quality that will probably be displayed. Still can’t get my head around how a kids ticket can cost £33 too.</p>
      <p><b>Pricey -</b> Can I redo the survey you sent me?</p>

      <h3>How will Aston Villa get on against Newcastle United?</h3>
      <h4>500+ VOTES SO FAR</h4>
      <p>Villa win Draw Newcastle win</p>
      <p><b>Scott -</b> That expensive against Liverpool’s under 21s?</p>
      <p><b>Adam -</b> Think I will give my seat up for this game those prices are ridiculous.</p>
      <p><b>Elliott -</b> For a game on Sky Sports, the week before Christmas and Liverpool's reserves this is absolutely shocking villa. What on earth are you thinking?</p>
      <p><b>Matt -</b> Safe to say the club have completely miss judged it. Its a reserve side vs reserve on Sky. I go home and away with my lad but for this kind of money for the teams put out I will skip this, sad but those prices are ridiculous whoever thought it was acceptable needs head looking at.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><b>Tom Parker -</b> Disgraceful prices at an expensive time of year. Big mistake.</p>
      <p><b>Jamie Tilt -</b> Good luck selling this one out with prices like that.</p>
      <p><b>OviAVFC -</b> Not one to complain usually but prices are ridiculous to go and watch a game against Liverpool's U19s.</p>
