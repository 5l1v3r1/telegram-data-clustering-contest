      <h1>Eagles' Darren Sproles has torn hip flexor muscle, out for season</h1>

      <p>PHILADELPHIA -- The <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-eagles">Eagles</a> have brought back running back <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2573300/jay-ajayi">Jay Ajayi</a> after losing veteran <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/8544/darren-sproles">Darren Sproles</a> for the rest of the season due to a torn right hip flexor, the team announced Friday.</p>
      <p>Starting running back <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3060022/jordan-howard">Jordan Howard</a>, meanwhile, has yet to be cleared for contact as the result of a shoulder stinger, putting his status for Sunday's game against the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ne/new-england-patriots">New England Patriots</a> in doubt. He is listed as questionable on the official injury report.</p>
      <p>In other news, receiver <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14912/alshon-jeffery">Alshon Jeffery</a> and linebacker <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15075/nigel-bradham">Nigel Bradham</a> were both ruled out against the Patriots because of ankle injuries.</p>
      <p>The 36-year-old Sproles, who moved past Hall of Fame receiver Tim Brown and into <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/27783706/darren-sproles-moves-fifth-career-all-purpose-yards">fifth place in career all-purpose yards</a> this season, acknowledged on Instagram that it could be the end of the road after 15 seasons.</p>

      <p>Ajayi has not played since last October, when he suffered a torn ACL while with the Eagles. Still, there appears to be a real chance that Ajayi suits up this weekend as an option behind rookie <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4045163/miles-sanders">Miles Sanders</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3051439/boston-scott">Boston Scott</a>.</p>
      <p>"Yeah, I think so," coach Doug Pederson said when asked if he'd be comfortable with Ajayi getting some snaps against New England. "Don't lose sight, too, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2968226/deangelo-henderson">De'Angelo Henderson</a> is on our practice squad. He's another candidate that has been working really hard in our offense, knows our system, and has been here, too. So we have a couple of options there. If it's Jay, and really if it's either one, I think we can give them a little bit of work."</p>

      <p>Ajayi was acquired by Philadelphia at the trade deadline in 2017 and helped the team during its Super Bowl charge, as he rushed for 408 yards and a touchdown in seven regular-season games and an additional 184 yards in the postseason.</p>
      <p>Injuries limited him to four games in 2018.</p>
      <p>Sproles suffered a partial tear of the hip flexor muscle Oct. 6 against the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyj/new-york-jets">New York Jets</a>, the team said in a statement. After a lengthy rehab, he returned Nov. 3 against the Bears. He reported the most recent injury after Wednesday's practice, the team said, and further testing revealed the torn hip flexor.</p>
      <p>He had been listed on the injury report with a quadriceps problem.</p>
      <p>Sproles appeared in six games this season, finishing with 66 yards on 17 carries.</p>
