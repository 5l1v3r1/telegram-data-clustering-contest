      <h1>Vale Hospital's out-of-hours opening figures continuing to get worse</h1>
      <h2>The news comes despite repeated positive messages about the hospital's future.</h2>

      <p>Concerns remain over the Vale of Leven Hospital’s closure-ridden out-of-hours unit despite repeated “positive” messages about the facility’s future.</p>
      <p>The Lennox Herald demanded answers from NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde this week over plans for the service which was closed for 18 out of 30 days in September alone and was previously branded the worst for closures across the entire health board area.</p>
      <p>After a visit from health secretary Jeane Freeman in August, campaigners and patients were reassured about the hospital’s viability and it emerged GPs were poised to run their own rota.</p>
      <p>But three months down the line, there are still no definite plans on how the service will operate despite the figures getting worse.</p>
      <p>The GP out-of-hours unit has been closed for 128 days this year so far having been shut a total of 83 times in 2018.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>MSP Jackie Baillie is furious. The Labour member told us: “It is clear that despite calls from the public and myself, the health board have made little change to ensuring that our out-of-hours service is available for local patients.</p>
      <p>“There are still an eye watering number of closures and <br/>even worse, the closures are increasing.</p>
      <p>“The health board have spoken at length about their desire to improve out-of-hours services at the Vale of Leven, but actions speak louder than <br/>words.</p>
      <p>“For the sake of patients in my constituency, improvements must be made as a matter of urgency.</p>
      <p>“Local patients are being disadvantaged, they simply cannot continue to suffer as a result of these out-of-hours closures.</p>
      <p>“The health board must take action urgently.”</p>
      <p>We asked the health board about the current arrangements and if discussions were ongoing to arrange GPs running their own rota to service the unit and were given this response.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>A spokeswoman said: “We have had two very recent meetings with Hospitalwatch which have highlighted positive areas for development.</p>
      <p>“In August we hosted a workshop to look at a redesign of the ‘front door’ services, including what further work could be done to help provide a more sustainable Out of Hours service at the Vale of Leven Hospital.</p>
      <p>The exact format of this has not yet been agreed and work is still progressing.</p>
      <p>“We will continue to work with local clinicians and stakeholders to develop these proposals.”</p>
      <p>The GP out-of-hours service has been dogged by problems for years and subject to closures at short notice with patients being sent to either the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley or Gartnavel Royal in Glasgow for treatment.</p>
      <p>Although patients are told to call 111 before attending at the Vale for emergency access to a doctor outwith regular surgery <br/>hours.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Recommendations had been made that the unit would close during the week but remain open at weekends as a full-scale investigation was launched into how the service across the health board area could be run.</p>
      <p>Last year, health minister Joe Fitzpatrick told Jackie Baillie in parliament: “The Scottish Government are working closely with health boards and integration authorities to ensure that a safe and effective general practitioner-led out-of-hours service is provided across Scotland.”</p>
