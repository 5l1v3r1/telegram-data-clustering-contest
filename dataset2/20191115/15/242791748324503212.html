      <h1>NASA's Astronaut Training Could Help Cancer Patients Recover From Treatment</h1>

      <p>Around 90 percent of patients now overcome early-stage cancer, yet the toxic effects of chemotherapy and other types of treatment can have a detrimental effect on the overall health of survivors. According to a new commentary in the journal <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(19)31174-2?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867419311742%3Fshowall%3Dtrue">Cell</a>, exercise-based therapy protocols devised by NASA to help astronauts withstand the stress of spaceflight could also aid recovery from <a href="https://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/revolutionary-cancer-therapy-yields-unprecedented-results/">cancer treatment</a>.</p>
      <p>Outside of Earth’s atmosphere, <a href="https://www.iflscience.com/space/five-things-happen-your-body-space/">astronauts’ bodies</a> are subjected to microgravity and higher levels of radiation, which the study authors say has a similar impact to being treated for cancer. Physical inactivity and changes in body weight compound these effects, for both astronauts and cancer patients.</p>
      <p>Consequently, symptoms such as muscle atrophy, bone demineralization, anemia, and immune dysfunction are commonly experienced by those in orbit, as well as people undergoing <a href="https://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/a-protein-explains-why-some-cancers-resist-chemotherapy/">chemotherapy</a>, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and other forms of cancer treatment.</p>
      <p>Describing the similar cognitive effects of spaceflight and cancer treatment, study co-author Jessica Scott explained in a <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-11/cp-twa110719.php">statement</a> that "astronauts may get something called space fog, where they have trouble focusing or get a little forgetful. That's very similar to what some cancer patients experience, which is called chemo brain."</p>
      <p>Back in the 1960s, NASA scientists calculated that astronauts taking part in the Gemini missions experienced a 25 percent decrease in cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) after just four days of microgravity. Interestingly, various anticancer regimens have been found to produce a similar decline in CRF.</p>

      <p>When devising a protocol to combat the effects of spaceflight, NASA opted against the use of pharmaceutical drugs due to their potential to cause unwanted side-effects like drowsiness or arrhythmia. Instead, an exercise-based program was introduced in order to improve the reserve capacity of all bodily systems before spaceflight, thereby enhancing astronauts’ ability to withstand the stresses of extra-terrestrial travel.</p>
      <p>Continued exercise while in space is designed to help astronauts maintain their physiological functionality at around 75 percent of their pre-flight levels, and further training after landing back on Earth ensures they return to their baseline capacity as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p>However, the researchers note that “structured exercise rehabilitation is not standard of care in any cancer population or setting,” despite <a href="https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc6804903">growing evidence</a> that it produces enhancements in CRF and other bodily functions for patients undergoing cancer treatment.</p>
      <p>Summarising the paper’s findings, Scott says that “this NASA exercise framework could be applied to help the approximately 1 million individuals that will be diagnosed with cancer in the United States this year, as well as the over 15 million cancer survivors in the United States today."</p>
