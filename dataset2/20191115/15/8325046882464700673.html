      <p><a href="https://www.hollandpix.com/">Van Duijn</a>, 34, told Insider that he traveled from the Netherlands to <a href="https://www.insider.com/vienna-tourist-attractions-compared-to-worst-online-reviews-photos-2019-10">Vienna, Austria</a>, so that he could photograph <a href="https://www.insider.com/photographer-captures-squirrels-playing-tiny-musical-instruments-2019-10">ground squirrels</a>.</p>
      <p>It took him two hours and 200 photos to capture the picture-perfect moment.</p>

      <p>“There were a lot of curious squirrels, so it was hard not to photograph them,” he said. “To capture one with a flower like this took a lot of patience and shots.”</p>

      <h3>The next picture shows the squirrel clutching the flower to its chest, closing its eyes as it takes in the scent.</h3>

      <p>“The moment the squirrel smelled the flower and planted his face in the flower, I knew this was the picture of a lifetime!” Van Duijn said.</p>

      <h3>Van Duijn also captured the moment the squirrel leaned in to take a bite of the daisy after smelling it.</h3>

      <p>Van Duijn said it was an incredible thing to witness and <a href="https://www.insider.com/lion-cub-photo-comedy-wildlife-photography-awards-winner-2019-11">capture on camera</a>.</p>
      <p>“I felt really happy and satisfied with the shot,” he added.</p>

      <h3>Van Duijn’s photos have since gone viral across the globe. He believes their popularity is partly due to people’s disconnect from nature.</h3>

      <p>“I think people don’t spend enough time in nature because of the lifestyle we have developed in the west,” he said.</p>
      <p>“When people are reminded about how beautiful and <a href="https://www.insider.com/dog-photographer-of-the-year-2019-winners-2019-10#this-years-overall-winner-and-first-place-winner-of-the-oldies-category-was-dreaming-merlin-taken-by-denise-czichocki-of-switzerland-1">cute nature can be</a>, they’ll feel better about themselves and the world around them.”</p>
