      <p>Jack Ross has vowed to help Hibernian live up to their big gun billing in Scotland after being confirmed as the club’s new head coach.</p>
      <p>The former Alloa, St Mirren and Sunderland boss emerged as the early front-runner to replace Paul Heckingbottom and has now agreed a three-and-a-half-year deal.</p>
      <p>Hibs finished third on their return to the Ladbrokes Premiership in 2017 under Neil Lennon.</p>
      <p>But last season saw them slip to fifth after Lennon’s reign ended amid a controversial fall-out with chief executive Leeann Dempster.</p>

      <p>Heckingbottom was brought in with four months of the campaign left but while he went unbeaten in his first 10 games in charge, this term has been a wretched watch for the Leith faithful who got their wish as the former Leeds manager was axed after taking just nine points from the first 33 on offer.</p>
      <p>Hibs now sit eighth after caretaker boss Eddie May guided the side to a much-needed win over St Johnstone last week.</p>
      <p>But Ross still faces an uphill task as he looks to guide his new team – who are perched just two points above the relegation play-off spot – away from trouble.</p>
      <p>However, the former full-back is up for the challenge.</p>
      <p>Ross – who will meet his new squad for the first time on Monday ahead of his opening game against Motherwell the following Saturday – said: “I’m proud to have been named head coach of Hibernian Football Club.</p>

      <p>“I think we all consider Hibernian to be one of the leading clubs in Scottish football – in terms of the history and passion of the supporters. It’s up to all of us to help the squad live up to that.</p>
      <p>“We have some talented players, underpinned by a successful academy, and I’ll do everything I can to make sure we’re able to help every player fulfil his potential.”</p>
      <p>The signs looked good for Heckingbottom last term but his honeymoon period quickly came to an end as a list of summer recruits failed to hit the ground running.</p>
      <p>His only league win this term came on the opening day of the campaign against St Mirren thanks to a late winner from Scott Allan and he was eventually sacked with his team sitting just two places off bottom.</p>
      <p>But Hibs executive chairman Ron Gordon believes a bright future lies ahead with Ross – named PFA Scotland’s manager of the year after guiding St Mirren back to the top-flight in 2018 – now at the helm.</p>

      <p>“Leeann and Graeme (Mathie) led a thorough recruitment process that unearthed some outstanding candidates but, in the end, the verdict was unanimous.</p>
      <p>“We look forward to seeing what Jack brings to the Hibernian Training Centre and Easter Road Stadium as part of the team who will strive towards achieving our sporting goals.”</p>
      <p>Dempster added: “Jack made a very strong impression on us during the interview process but he is someone we have obviously been aware of for some time.</p>
      <p>“We are confident that Jack will help drive this club forward and we will do everything that we can, as a board, to support that.”</p>
