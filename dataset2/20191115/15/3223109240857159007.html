      <h1>Watch: Astronauts Take Complex Spacewalk to Fix Cosmic Ray Detector</h1>

      <p>Two International Space Station (ISS) astronauts are completing a spacewalk today to fix a dark matter experiment and you can the repair operation live on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evaBhht5uGA">NASA TV</a>.</p>
      <p>At 6:39 a.m. EST, Expedition 61 Commander Luca Parmitano (European Space Agency) and NASA flight engineer Andrew Morgan went outside the <a href="https://www.geek.com/news/watch-first-all-female-spacewalk-is-underway-at-international-space-station-1807837/">space station</a> to replace a cooling system on the <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/spacestation/2019/11/15/veteran-spacewalkers-begin-complex-work-to-repair-cosmic-particle-detector/">Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS)</a>, a cosmic ray detector. This is the first spacewalk in a series of many that will fix the experiment, which was built to find dark matter in space, <a href="https://www.space.com/space-station-astronauts-first-ams-repair-spacewalk-webcast.html">Space.com noted</a>.</p>

      <p>The first spacewalk will involve both astronauts positioning materials, taking out a debris cover on the AMS, and placing handrails in preparation for upcoming spacewalks. The astronauts are expected to complete the tasks in approximately six-and-a-half hours.</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://www.geek.com/news/nasas-juno-spacecraft-snaps-swirly-jovian-vortex-view-1810048/">NASA</a>, AMS is a joint effort between NASA and the Department of Energy’s Office of Science. AMS has been capturing high-energy cosmic rays, so researchers can answer important questions about antimatter, the unseen <a href="https://www.geek.com/news/cygnus-resupply-mission-is-bringing-these-cool-experiments-to-the-space-station-1808918/">“dark matter”</a> that makes up most of the mass in the universe and weird dark energy that’s responsible for expanding the cosmos.</p>
      <p>NASA has not shared a date for the second AMS repair spacewalk yet.</p>
