      <p>THOUSANDS of twinkling lights pierce the winter skies of Sunderland, as the city’s magical Festival of Light is reborn for 2019. Inspire finds out how this stunning annual event is adding a sprinkle of enchantment to the city centre throughout the festive season...</p>
      <p>AS THE cold winter nights draw in, and shoppers snap up the last of their Christmas goodies, on the edge of Sunderland’s city centre, Mowbray Park is aglow – alive with sparkling lighting installations.</p>
      <p>Every Thursday to Sunday from November 21 to December 22, the Festival of Light is injecting magic and sparkle into beautiful municipal parkland that stands in the shadow of the Sunderland Museum and Winter Gardens. A host of lighting installations will adorn the trees and lawns of Sunderland’s award-winning Green Flag park. And family-friendly shows, taking place in a magical tipi, are also available to book for those who want to add some extra entertainment to their visit. Along with live music, street theatre and a host of children’s activities, the Festival of Light promises to be truly magical.</p>
      <p>It is part of a packed programme of Christmas activity in the heart of Sunderland that is bringing plenty of festive cheer to residents and visitors alike. Alongside the city’s fantastic range of shops, restaurants and bars, Sunderland has welcomed back its popular outdoor ice rink, which lies on Keel Square.</p>
      <p>The frozen rink will be open every day over the festive period, excluding Christmas and New Year’s Day. Other family-friendly festive activities on offer in Sunderland include a visit to Sunniside’s Empire Cinema to enjoy Frozen 2, a trip to see Cinderella as the Sunderland Empire, or there’s the chance to take part in the city’s Reindeer Dash on Sunday, December 8. For something a little bit different, Hadrian’s Tipi stands close to the city’s Keel Square. The Bridges shopping centre, just metres from the Tipi, is also playing host to a shimmering snow-scene complete with Santa’s Grotto. The Disney Store, The Entertainer and Debenhams are among the most popular retailers to tick off for those in pursuit of the latest must-have toys.</p>
      <p>The scene is set for a scintillating Christmas in Sunderland.
