      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T15:51:35+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 15:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/meet-the-team/#dianagoovaerts" target="_blank">Diana Goovaerts</a></address>
      <p>Orange celebrated steady gains in its banking unit <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/home-banner/orange-bank-launches-across-france/">two years after its launch</a>, and revealed it is poised to open its digital banking offer to the public in Spain.</p>
      <p>The company said Orange Bank now has more than half a million customers, with new users joining at a pace of more than 20,000 per month.</p>
      <p>Around 25 per cent of new customers are acquired through loan products, while the remainder sign up for standard bank accounts, it added.</p>
      <p>It said the services “most appreciated by customers” include mobile payments, SMS money transfers and real-time balance updates. It plans to add support for Google Pay into the mix “soon” for customers with Android devices.</p>
      <p>Paul de Leusse, CEO of Orange Bank, stated its progress to date “confirmed that we have the right strategy”.</p>
      <p>Orange Bank initially launched in France, but the company said it expects to rollout a <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/money-home-banner/orange-bank-targets-2019-spain-expansion/">digital banking offer in Spain</a> “in the very near future,” which will include bank accounts, Mastercard cards, Apple Pay and other “innovative functionalities”.</p>
      <p>It added it also plans to deploy a savings and loan offer in Africa sometime in 2020.</p>
