      <h1>White House Releases Text of First Phone Call Between Trump, Zelensky</h1>
      <h2>No mention of Biden family during call</h2>

        <b>The White House has released the memo of the first phone call between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The summary may have dashed some hopes as there’s no mention of the Bidens in there at all.</p>

      <p>The call, made just a few hours after Zelensky was elected in Ukraine, is little more than a brief exchange of pleasantries, with Trump congratulating Zelensky on his presidency and the two heads of state talking about how great their respective countries are.</p>
      <p>Zelensky invites Trump to his inauguration, and Trump says they’ll meet soon, whether at the inauguration or elsewhere.</p>

      <p>But with an impeachment inquiry in full swing, Trump’s nemeses in the Democratic Party have pounced on the conversation anyway.</p>
      <p>While former vice president Joe Biden, said to be the focus of the corruption investigation in Trump’s alleged quid pro quo, doesn’t make an appearance at all, that hasn’t stopped #Resistance stalwarts from trying to find a connection in the bare-bones protocol call.</p>
