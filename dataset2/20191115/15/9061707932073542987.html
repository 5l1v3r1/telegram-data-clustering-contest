      <h1>Activists protest against meal featuring boar and venison at Derby Museum</h1>
      <h2>The meal is going ahead tomorrow</h2>

      <p>A game dinner event planned for <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-museums">Derby Museum</a> has been "scaled down" following criticism.</p>
      <p>The "Taste of Game" event, organised by the British Association for Shooting and Conservation, was set to see its members tuck into a meal including rabbit, venison and wild boar.</p>
      <p>The meal was to be held in Derby Museum's gallery on Saturday, November 16, but will now be a smaller event in a different part of the museum.</p>
      <p>Derby Hunt Saboteurs, an animal rights group, urged the museum to cancel the dinner with a petition that has attracted more than 800 signatures.</p>
      <p>The group has also planned a protest to take place on the day of the event.</p>
      <p>They said in the wording of the petition: "Derby Museums have hired their venue to the British Association for Shooting and Conservation and we urge them to reconsider.</p>
      <p>"We are opposed to the shooting of animals for sport, both because of our moral objection to killing for sport and because of the unnecessary suffering and collateral damage to wildlife and the environment that is caused by commercial shooting.</p>
      <p>"In their bid to have as many grouse as possible shot for sport and profit, gamekeepers wage a war of persecution on animals that predate them."</p>
      <p>But a spokesperson at the British Association for Shooting and Conservation said the meal was made up of ethical and sustainable food.</p>
      <p>They said the evening was about "promoting all that is great about the British countryside".</p>
      <p>In a statement, they said: “We are sure that right-minded people in Derbyshire would be appalled that a small number of extremists can use social media as a weapon to target legitimate businesses in their area.</p>
      <p>“The menu on the evening includes rabbit, venison and wild boar. The food has all been sourced ethically and sustainably and, quite frankly, is as healthy and as close to nature as it is possible to get.</p>
      <p>“We applaud the museum for standing strong against this and for allowing the evening to go ahead.</p>
      <p>"We look forward to a fantastic event and those lucky enough to have tickets will be delighted at what we will serve up.”</p>
      <p>In a statement, Derby Museums acknowledged the criticism it had received over the decision, in the first instance, to hire out the Notice Nature Feel Joy Gallery.</p>
      <p>They said: "In an earlier statement, we explained that our decision to allow an event related to game shooting to take place in this area of the Museum was an error of judgement.</p>
      <p>"We felt that holding such an event in this space would have represented a conflict of messaging, given that this particular gallery is dedicated to nurturing wildlife and people’s experience of nature.</p>
      <p>"A large number of visitors and supporters expressed their concern about this.</p>
      <p>"The event has consequently been scaled down and relocated, and will not be taking place in the Museums’ galleries."</p>
      <p>The statement added that the museum is a "longstanding and committed supporter of wildlife conservation" and promised to "continue to champion this cause".</p>
      <p>It added: "We understand the strength of feeling in relation to this event, however we believe it is important to honour the private booking with our client, whilst allowing a peaceful protest to take place and keeping people safe."</p>
