      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T15:41:31+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 15:41</time> by <a rel="author">Zoe Forsey, https://www.facebook.com/zoeforseymirror/</a></address>
      <p>Prince Harry took his son Archie to nursery for the first time this week, and make a joke to the other parents about his ginger hair.</p>
      <p>The Duke's wife <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/meghan-markle">Meghan Markle</a> has been to the Windsor centre with their little boy previously, but it was now dad's turn to go along.</p>
      <p>According to a source, Archie was "particularly taken" by two other red-haired babies, which Harry picked up on straight away, reports the <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/1204692/prince-harry-news-Meghan-markle-baby-archie-hair-colour-ginger-royal-news">Express</a> .</p>
      <p>They said: "Archie had a fantastic time. He was crawling around and was particularly taken with two other red-haired babies.</p>
      <p>“The Duke said: ‘Gingers stick together!’"</p>
      <p>Meghan <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/baby-archie-officially-starts-playgroup-20586801">revealed she had started taking Archie to the playgroup last month</a> , and it sounds like he's really enjoying it.</p>

      <p>Speaking to a Milly Sutherland, 11, and her mum Angela, 50, at the Wellchild Awards, she said: “I just took Archie for his first [playgroup] class. It was a lot of fun. He loved it.”</p>
      <p>Afterwards Angela said: “She took him to one of these baby classes today and she said they had loads of fun together. She said it was really good fun.”</p>
      <p>Meghan and Harry are taking a six-week break from their royal duties to spend some “much-needed” family time together.</p>
      <p>They will travel to California to see Meghan's mum Doria Ragland.</p>

      <p>Their decision also means they won't spend Christmas Day with the Royal Family at Sandringham, as is tradition.</p>
      <p>Prince William and Kate are expected at Sandringham with their three children and other members of the royal family as a rift between the two brothers shows no sign of being quashed.</p>
      <p>A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said: “The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are looking forward to extended family time towards the end of this month.</p>
      <p>“Having spent the last two Christmases at Sandringham, Their Royal Highnesses will spend the holiday this year, as a new family, with the Duchess’ mother Doria Ragland.</p>
      <p>“This decision is in line with precedent set previously by other members of the Royal Family, and has the support of Her Majesty The Queen.</p>
      <p>“For security reasons, we will not be providing further details on their schedule at this time.”</p>
