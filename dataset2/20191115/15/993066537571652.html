      <p>A mother locked in a legal battle to secure a medicinal cannabis prescription for her severely epileptic son has said they are "on a cliff edge" waiting for privately-sourced treatment to run out.</p>
      <p>Charlotte Caldwell expressed fears that current arrangements where the medication is "gifted" on a week-by-week basis will be ended.</p>
      <p>The Co Tyrone woman is seeking confirmation from the High Court in Belfast that cannabis can be prescribed to her 14-year-old son Billy on the NHS.</p>
      <p>Proceedings were adjourned today for a letter on that issue to be sent to an expert in paediatric neurology at Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital in London.</p>
      <p>Outside court, Mrs Caldwell said: "We're standing on the edge of a cliff, we know that the rock is going to give way, but we just don't know when.</p>
      <p>"We're at the mercy of the manufacturer who is gifting us this medicine, we're at the mercy of the court, and we're at the mercy of these doctors."</p>
      <p>Although Billy is currently receiving a product from a North American company free of charge, there are no guarantees over how long that arrangement will continue.</p>

      <p>In November last year the rules were relaxed to allow some cannabis-derived medicines to be prescribed to patients in the UK by specialist doctors in limited circumstances.</p>
      <p>It followed the high-profile case when Billy and his mother had cannabis oil brought back from Canada confiscated at London's Heathrow Airport.</p>
      <p>The boy was then admitted to hospital after suffering seizures.</p>
      <p>Despite the new guidelines, access to medication remains uncertain.</p>
      <p>Mrs Caldwell brought a case against the Health and Social Care Board over an alleged failure to take a decision on the Canadian-sourced treatment.</p>
      <p>She wants a declaration that a Northern Ireland-based GP or clinician who is not on the specialist register can lawfully write prescriptions for cannabis-based medication under the direction of a consultant paediatrician with higher qualifications in epilepsy diagnosis and management.</p>
      <p>Mrs Caldwell also wants an assurance from the court that she can lawfully administer the drug to her son.</p>
      <p>In court today her barrister, Monye Anyadike-Danes QC, said: "My client's greatest fear is something slips between the cracks and Billy runs out of his medication.</p>
      <p>"He has not been without his medication bar one period when it was taken from him at Heathrow and he ended up in hospital."</p>
      <p>Counsel for the Board said it cannot fund a private prescription, but stressed it will do as much as possible to help.</p>
      <p>Adjourning the case to next month, Mrs Justice Keegan urged both sides to work together in an effort to find a solution under a shared care arrangement.</p>
      <p>She told them: "Create a letter to send to Great Ormond Street, highlighting the issues you need answered, I want joint input into that."</p>
