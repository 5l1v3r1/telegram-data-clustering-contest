      <h1>Reporter Says Browns Players “Celebrated” Myles Garrett’s Actions</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T15:55:58+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 15:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>The Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers are both bracing for looming suspensions as a result of the final moments between their game Thursday night.</p>
      <p>Browns defensive end Myles Garrett and Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph engaged in an altercation that led to Garrett swinging <a href="https://thespun.com/nfl/afc-north/cleveland-browns/video-myles-garrett-ejected-after-swinging-helmet-at-mason-rudolph">Rudolph’s own helmet at his head</a>.</p>
      <p>Garrett ripped Rudolph’s helmet off and hit the quarterback with it before being tackled by two Steelers players.</p>
      <p>While the altercation was going on, one ESPN reporter suggested Browns players were “celebrating” on the sideline.</p>
      <p>“Wildest thing I ever saw. Was 10 yards from it. Myles Garrett completely lost it, connected the helmet square on Mason Rudolph’s head. And the Browns were celebrating the whole thing from the sideline,” Fowler said.</p>

      <p>It’s difficult to gauge intent and the Browns could have been celebrating a big win over a division-rival.</p>
      <p>However, Cleveland is the most-penalized team in the league and will likely now be without its star defensive end for several games. Steelers offensive lineman Maurkice Pouncey and Browns defensive lineman Larry Ogunjobi will also likely be suspended for their actions.</p>
      <p>We haven’t heard the last about this incident. Pittsburgh and Cleveland face off against in just 16 days – this time in Pittsburgh.</p>
      <p>Stay tuned for the latest.</p>
