      <h1>WhatsApp gets cool “from Facebook” dark mode splash screen</h1>

      <p><a href="https://facebook.com/">Facebook</a> has been working to weave together their messaging apps in an effort to avoid regulators breaking up the company’s products.  In <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/whatsapp-gets-whatsapp-from-facebook-tag-in-the-latest-beta-update/">August we reported</a> that Facebook added a “from Facebook” tag to the settings page in the WhatsApp app.</p>

      <p>Today Facebook has escalated the branding war by adding the “from Facebook” tag to the splash screen of the app in Dark Mode.</p>

      <p>The text showed up in the latest WhatsApp beta build 2.19.332 and also includes more prominent branding in the Settings section of the app.</p>
      <p>Facebook purchased WhatsApp in <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/facebook-purchase-whatsapp-for-19-billion-but-expect-nothing-to-change/">February of 2014</a> and initially ran the service as a separate company. Over the last year, however, there has been a  clear move to bring the up under closer control of the parent company.  Rumours hit the internet back in January when <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/now-we-know-why-whatsapps-founders-quit-and-its-not-good-news/">The New York Times published a report</a> explaining the reason why WhatsApp founders quit Facebook. Later, Facebook said they <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/facebook-rethinks-their-plans-to-destroy-whatsapp-messenger-and-instagram/">weren’t ready</a> to integrate the apps just yet, but did confirm their plan was to proceed as rapidly as possible.</p>
