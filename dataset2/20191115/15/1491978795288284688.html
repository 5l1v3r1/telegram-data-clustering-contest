        <i>A society can’t flourish if its citizens can’t make a plan to meet for a beer</i>
      </p>
      <p>Ninety years ago this year, Joseph Stalin unveiled an ingenious new scheme to transform the Soviet Union into an industrial powerhouse: the end of the seven-day <a href="https://www.historytoday.com/archive/stalins-topsy-turvy-work-week">week</a>. Much of the workforce switched to a four-day week, plus one day off – but they were divided into five cohorts, each resting on a different day, so factories could run without stopping. The propaganda, according to the historian Clive Foss, was that “workers would get more rest; production and employment would increase [and] leisure time would be more rationally employed, for cultural activities (theatre, clubs, sports) would no longer have to be crammed into a weekend, but could flourish every day, with their facilities far less crowded.”</p>
      <p>It proved massively unpopular, though, not least because it made communal life impossible: families and friends with different rest days couldn’t coordinate social time together. (“That’s no holiday, if you have to celebrate by yourself,” one worker complained.) Stalin didn’t mind – undermining the centrality of the family was part of his plan, after all – but the new week didn’t boost production as planned, either, so it was phased out. Yet, as the writer Judith Shulevitz pointed out in the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/11/why-dont-i-see-you-anymore/598336/">Atlantic</a> recently, the social chaos of unsynchronised schedules has returned. It’s just that these days it’s imposed not by the state, but by unpredictable work patterns. Employees subject to “on-demand scheduling” and zero-hour contracts get the worst of it. Meanwhile, plenty of fancier jobs require staying late at short notice, or scrapping a weekend plan to plough through emails.</p>
      <p>Crucially, the problem here isn’t a lack of free time: research suggests we generally have <a href="https://reason.com/2016/11/15/we-work-less-have-more-leisure-time-and/">more leisure</a> than in the past. The issue is that we can’t coordinate it, so as to spend it fulfillingly with others – thanks partly to the decline of conventions and institutions that used to organise time on our behalf, including the traditional nine-to-five job. Ironically, this is true even for people who <i>do</i> have control over their schedules, like me. Nobody dictates my hours, nor those of many in my social circle. Yet that hardly spares us those months-long email chains trying to arrange a meetup. My patchwork calendar of work deadlines and toddler play dates is no more likely to mesh with my friends’ availability than if our diaries were being determined by our bosses.</p>
      <p>And we should care about this, writes Shulevitz, not solely for quality of life reasons, but for political ones, too: “It’s a cliche among political philosophers that, if you want to create the conditions for tyranny, you sever the bonds of intimate relationship and local community.” To put it simplistically: a society can’t flourish if its citizens can’t make a plan to meet for a beer.</p>
      <p>The real solutions to this situation will be political, too. But in the meantime, those of us with some control of our time could make this tiny resolution: not to cry off social plans for lame reasons. If I’ve agreed to meet you, I’ll try to resist the weaselly urge to stay home instead. Which maybe isn’t such a tiny thing at all; when the whole momentum of society goes towards making it harder to coordinate with others, doing so anyway is a subversive act. Even better, it’s a subversive act where I get to drink beer.</p>

      <p>In her book The Sabbath World, Judith Shulevitz makes the case that rest requires more than just not working: we need social customs, ancient or adapted, to help us slow down.</p>
