      <h1>Trump slams Marie Yovanovitch during her testimony in House impeachment inquiry</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T15:41:29+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 15:41</time> by <a rel="author">Yaron Steinbuch</a></address>
      <p>Minutes after former ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/trump-impeachment-hearings-livestream-watch-marie-yovanovitchs-testimony/">began testifying in the House impeachment inquiry</a>, President Trump slammed her on Twitter, saying that everywhere she went “turned bad.”</p>
      <p>“She started off in Somalia, how did that go? Then fast forward to Ukraine, where the new Ukrainian President spoke unfavorably about her in my second phone call with him,” the president said as the second public hearing was in progress on Capitol Hill.</p>
      <p>“It is a US President’s absolute right to appoint ambassadors,” Trump said.</p>
      <p>“They call it ‘serving at the pleasure of the President.’ The US now has a very strong and powerful foreign policy, much different than proceeding administrations,” <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1195356211937468417">he continued</a>.</p>
      <p>“It is called, quite simply, America First! With all of that, however, I have done FAR more for Ukraine than O,” he added, referring to former President Barack Obama.</p>
      <p>In his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump said: “The former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news.”</p>

      <p>While he appeared to attribute his decision to remove her in part to the opinion of Zelensky, Trump had already removed Yovanovitch by the time of the phone call.</p>
      <p>“The Impeachment Witch Hunt should be over with the statement made last night by the President and Foreign Minister of Ukraine,” the president said in an earlier tweet Friday.</p>
      <p>“Nervous Nancy Pelosi, who should be home cleaning up the dangerous &amp; disgusting Slum she is making of her District in San Francisco, where even the filth pouring into the Pacific Ocean is rapidly becoming an environmental hazard, is getting NOTHING DONE,” he wrote.</p>
      <p>“She is a Do Nothing Democrat as Speaker, and will hopefully not be in that position very long. Approve USMCA, which has been sitting on her desk for months!”</p>
