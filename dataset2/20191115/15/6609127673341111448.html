        <b>A TEENAGE thug stabbed another schoolboy after a row about Snapchat messages.</b>

      <p>The attacker fled the busy street leaving the injured boy stricken on the ground in March this year.</p>
      <p>But, he was snared and pled guilty to assaulting the 13 year-old to his severe injury.</p>
      <p>The 15 year-old will be sentenced next month at Glasgow Sheriff Court.</p>

      <p>Neither boy - who went to different schools - can be named due to their age.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Harry Findlay said they had "got into a disagreement" about Snapchat messages sent by the attacker.</p>
      <p>The victim believed the 15 year-old may have wanted to fight him.</p>
      <p>Days later, the 13 year-old was on his school lunch break when the older boy struck.</p>
      <p>Mr Findlay: "He attacked him by surprise.</p>
      <p>"The 13 year-old tried to defend himself, but was taken out onto the busy road and oncoming traffic.</p>
      <p>"The accused produced a lock-back knife and stabbed him on the upper leg."</p>
      <p>As the victim slumped to the ground, the attacker ran off.</p>
      <p>A passer-by helped the 13 year-old, who ended up needing surgery for a leg wound.</p>
      <p>Sheriff Johanna Johnston QC bailed the attacker pending sentencing.</p>
      <p>She told him: “The upper leg has a major artery running through it and it can be damaged because of that.</p>
      <p>“You are well aware of the serious injury you caused and what happened to him following that. “This was something you wouldn’t want to suffer or anyone you knew.</p>
      <p>“You are well aware the court has to punish you.”</p>
