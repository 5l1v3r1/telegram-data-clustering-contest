      <p>Derbyshire has been battered by flooding this week following heavy rainfall.</p>
      <p>While the rain has just about stopped for now, residents have been urged to stay vigilant as flood warnings and alerts remain in place across the region.</p>
      <p>Several roads across the county are closed and Cross Country trains have been hit by cancellations, causing <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/derby-news/gallery/most-striking-pictures-yesterdays-flooding-3540425">disruption to travel</a> .</p>
      <p>A number of schools have also been closed due to the extent of the flooding.</p>
      <p>The Environment Agency says it is working with emergency responders and local authorities to protect people and properties in <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/">Derbyshire</a> and other parts of the country.</p>

      <p>If your home has been affected by flooding, you may be wondering whether your home has the correct insurance in place to make a claim.</p>
      <p>Here is what the government's <a href="https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/flood-insurance-getting-the-right-cover">Money Advice Service</a> says you should do in order to check if your home is covered.</p>
      <h3>Check all the details</h3>
      <p>To check whether you are covered in the event of a flood, the service says: "Check all the details in your buildings and contents insurance policies that relate to flooding and make sure you have enough cover to protect you in the event of a flood.</p>
      <p>"Even if your insurance isn’t up for renewal, it’s worth checking."</p>
      <h3>Call the insurance company</h3>
      <p>Next, homeowners will want to call their insurance company to inform them.</p>
      <p>It continues: "Call your insurance company to query anything you’re not sure about.</p>
      <p>"New laws mean that it’s up to insurance companies to ask the right questions about what they want to know.</p>
      <p>"But if your property has a history of flooding, you should inform your insurance company – even if they don’t ask.</p>
      <p>"The last thing you need is a hitch if you ever need to make a claim."</p>
