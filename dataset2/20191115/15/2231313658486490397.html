      <h1>Why Aurora Cannabis Stock Is Tanking Again Today</h1>
      <h2>The Canadian cannabis producer delivered much worse-than-expected fiscal 2020 first-quarter results.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T15:19:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 15:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fool.com/author/2035/" target="_blank">Keith Speights (TMFFishBiz)</a></address>
      <h3>What happened</h3>
      <p><b>Aurora Cannabis</b> (<a href="https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/aurora-cannabis-inc/acb/">NYSE:ACB</a>) shares were tanking 8.8% lower as of 10:03 a.m. EST on Friday after falling as much as 17.3% earlier in the morning. This marks the <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/11/14/why-aurora-cannabis-stock-is-sinking-today.aspx">second consecutive day of double-digit declines</a> for the Canadian marijuana stock. Thursday's drop came as investors anticipated bad news with the company's fiscal 2020 first-quarter results. Those results, announced after the market closed yesterday, were even worse than feared, prompting the continued sell-off today.</p>
      <h3>So what</h3>
      <p>Were Aurora's Q1 results bad enough to warrant such a big sell-off? The extent of how low the stock should go is debatable, but the results were really bad.</p>

      <p>Aurora posted Q1 total net revenue of 75.2 million in Canadian dollars. This was a 24% <i>decline</i> from fiscal 2019 Q4 and a lot less than analysts expected. The company saw net revenue in the Canadian adult-use recreational cannabis market plunge 33% from the previous quarter.</p>
      <p>After predicting earlier this year that positive adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (<a href="https://www.fool.com/knowledge-center/ebitda.aspx">EBITDA</a>) was on the way this year, Aurora took a big step backward on its path to profitability in Q1. The company reported an adjusted EBITDA loss of CA$39.7 million, reflecting marked deterioration from the adjusted EBITDA loss of CA$26.6 million in the prior quarter.</p>
      <h3>Now what</h3>
      <p>Aurora is suspending efforts to finish construction on its Aurora Nordic 2 facility and on its Aurora Sun facility. The company expects these moves to cut capital expenditures by close to CA$190 million. It also has put forward <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/11/15/aurora-cannabis-q1-was-a-dumpster-fire-but-heres-t.aspx">an alternative deal for owners of its convertible debentures maturing in March 2020</a> that avoids having to raise CA$230 million in cash.</p>
      <p>The current situation for Canadian <a href="https://www.fool.com/marijuana-stocks/">marijuana stocks</a> looks dismal. However, the cannabis derivatives market and opening of new retail stores, particularly in Ontario, should fuel growth next year. It was a rough quarter for Aurora, but the company is taking some prudent steps to right its ship. In the meantime, though, expect high levels of volatility for Aurora and its peers.</p>
