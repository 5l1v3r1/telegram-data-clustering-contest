      <p>“There are already signs saying ‘No entry,’ as the area is quite dangerous.</p>
      <p>“Some tourists may want to get better photos, but its quite steep and slippery there and he slipped.</p>
      <p>“A friend that accompanied him saw the man take pictures and fall —about a height equivalent to a three-storey house, he said.</p>
      <p>Police have already contacted the deceased’s relatives.</p>
      <p>Although a preliminary coroner’s report has yet to be issued, police believe the tourist died from fractured skull.</p>
