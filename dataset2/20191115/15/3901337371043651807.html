      <p>Eintracht Frankfurt captain David Abraham has been slapped with a seven-week ban after inciting a brawl during his side's 1-0 defeat to SC Freiburg last weekend.</p>
      <p>The Argentine midfielder knocked Freiburg manager Christian Streich to the ground during the match, which sparked a brawl between the sides' benches.</p>
      <p>Abraham was shown a red card for his indiscretions, and his actions also earned him a €25 000 (R4 million) fine, as well as a further €35 000 (R5.7 million) fine for his club.</p>

      <p>"Eintracht Frankfurt and the player will file an appeal against this ruling in order to give David Abraham the ability to express himself in person before the DFB sports court about what happened in Freiburg," the club said in a statement, as reported by <i>ESPN</i>.</p>
