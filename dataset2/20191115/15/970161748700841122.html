      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/billy-connolly/">Billy Connolly</a> has stopped dipping his willy into G&amp;Ts, so his next round at the pub is safe.</p>
      <p>The comedian revealed in his book, Tall Tales and Wee Stories: The Best of Billy Connolly, that he was once thrown out of a theatre in Scotland for putting his penis into his drink.</p>
      <p>As you do.</p>
      <p>‘I was banned from the Traverse Theatre in Edinburgh for having my willy in a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/gin/">gin</a> and tonic,’ he wrote.</p>
      <p>‘That’s taking it, I confess, that’s taking it a bit far.</p>
      <p>‘Actually I was trying not to be thrown out: “That’s right – throw me out! You didn’t know I was disabled – that’s how I drink!”’</p>
      <p>But the 76-year-old is adamant that he has put a stop to his antics.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.scotsman.com/arts-and-culture/books/billy-connolly-interview-1-5046779">In a chat with The Scotsman</a>, he said: ‘That’s true. I was banned. Then they had an exhibition of photographs and invited me in to see it and I said “but I’m banned”, so they lifted the ban for the night.</p>

      <p>‘Then they lifted it completely. So I’ve been back.’</p>
      <p>And he has absolutely not repeated the offence, explaining: ‘No I don’t stick my willy in a gin and tonic anymore.</p>
      <p>‘I gave up drinking. I still have the willy.’</p>
      <p>Good to know.</p>
      <p>In fact, Billy gave up drinking ‘years ago’, crediting wife Pam for ‘saving’ him.</p>
      <p>‘I loved the whole pub thing, getting p**sed with the boys, telling stories into the night…,’ he added to the publication. ‘And it was getting control, changing my personality.</p>
      <p>‘I became this other man. Pamela would say “bogey man has arrived”. And when it’s changing your personality you have to have a close look at it and do something about it. There’s nothing like the truth to put you right.’</p>
