      <h2>The thrifty duchess strikes again!</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T15:04:34+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 15:04</time> by <a rel="author">Nancy Brown</a></address>
      <p>Her husband Prince William recently revealed that she likes nothing more than to <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/prince-william/prince-william-reveals-kate-is-a-huge-strictly-come-dancing-fan/">watch the latest episode of Strictly Come Dancing</a> on a Saturday night.</p>
      <p>Now the Duchess of Cambridge has proved that she really is just like the rest of us as she recycled her outfit and arrived at a royal engagement by train.</p>
      <p>Kate, in her role as Royal Patron of East Anglia’s Children’s Hospices, was in Norfolk – close to their Anmer Hall home – to officially open The Nook children's hospice.</p>

      <p>Kate stepped out in the outfit at the Royal Opera House back in January of this year. She also wore it to a mental health conference in 2017.</p>
      <p>Further cementing her down-to-earth nature, the mother of three arrived at the engagement by train.</p>

      <p>Once at The Nook, Kate met some of the families the hospice helps.</p>
      <p>She accepted a bouquet of flowers from the family of three-year-old Stanley Harrold, who suffers from a rare chromosomal disorder.</p>

      <p>One told <a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/royalty/gallery/2019111580599/kate-middleton-opens-the-nook-norfolk/4/">Hello!</a>: "Kate said what a great place The Nook is and how wonderful it was for us to help."</p>
      <p>The caring duchess showed off her motherly side at the event too, as she asked a child: "Are you cold?” and rubbed his arm after seeing him shiver.</p>

      <p>"It was amazing. I shook her hand!" he exclaimed.</p>
      <p>At least Kate managed to stay upright at the event.</p>
      <p>She had onlookers worried – and husband <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/prince-william/">Prince William</a> in fits of giggles – as she <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/duchess-of-cambridge-trips-at-royal-engagement-with-prince-william/">tripped at an event earlier in the week</a>.</p>
