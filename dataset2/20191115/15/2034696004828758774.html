      <p><a href="http://nme.com/tag/star-wars"><i>Star Wars</i></a> fans have been reacting after a notorious scene from <i>A New Hope</i> was changed again upon the launch of Disney+.</p>
      <p>The streaming service launched yesterday (November 12) and fans have pointed out that one particular scene, which has changed multiple times since the 1977 original and become legendary as a result, has shifted once again.</p>

      <p>The scene in question has prompted plenty of debate over whether Han or Greedo shoot first in their battle during <i>A New Hope</i>.</p>
      <p>The 1977 original saw Han shoot Greedo before the latter could reach the trigger, but this was altered in a new edition of the film released in the late 1990s, with Greedo shooting first in the new version.</p>

      <p>Now, a tweaked version of the scene has made it into the Disney+ version of <i>A New Hope</i>, which sees neither of the pair shooting first – they fire at about the same time. Watch the scene below.</p>

      <p>There is another line added into the film too. According to <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/11/greedo-han-solo-star-wars-edit"><i>Vanity Fair</i></a>, a new line by Greedo, that he says before his death, was added in by Lucas before Disney acquired LucasFilm. The line simply sees him say “Maclunkey”.</p>
      <p>Greedo actor Paul Blake has now reacted to the new development, saying it “confused [him] incredibly”.</p>
      <p>Talking to <a href="https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/star-wars-greedo-maclunkey-disney-plus-exclusive-interview/"><i>Empire</i></a>, Blake said: “I couldn’t understand a word of it. It confused me incredibly, but I’ve never understood anything about the movies anyway, particularly that. The convention I’ve just come back from, I had a million opinions from everybody. This new word!”</p>
      <p>Expanding on the origins of “Maclunkey”, Blake continued: “Yeah, well he’s talking about his Scottish grandmother there. Greedo had a Scottish grandmother and an Irish grandfather, and a Rodian step-mother. That’s why he shouted ‘Maclunkey’ just before he died. He’s about to meet his grandfather. How absolutely absurd, what is George [Lucas] doing these days?”</p>
      <p>Others have shown a mix of delight and anger at the new change.</p>
