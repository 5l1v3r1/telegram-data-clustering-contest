      <h1>Sparks Fly as Jim Jordan Busts Adam Schiff for Hiding Four Transcripts</h1>
      <h2>Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) called out House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff’s (D-CA) lack of transparency as the chairman essentially dismissed President Trump releasing the transcript of his first phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.</h2>

      <p>Trump <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/15/donald-trump-releases-transcript-of-first-call-with-ukrainian-president-volodymyr-zelensky/">released</a> the transcript of his first phone call with Zelensky moments before Friday’s second public impeachment hearing featuring former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch.</p>
      <p>Nunes read the transcript aloud – a transcript that <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/15/donald-trump-releases-transcript-of-first-call-with-ukrainian-president-volodymyr-zelensky/">showed</a> a relatively brief phone call that featured an exchange of pleasantries.</p>
      <p>Schiff repeatedly refused to recognize Jordan, who pointed out Schiff has yet to authorize the release of four transcripts from his secret depositions.</p>
      <p>“There are four transcripts that have not been released,” Jordan began.</p>
      <p>“The gentleman is not recognized,” Schiff said, prompting a “holy cow” from Jordan.</p>
      <p>Schiff said he was “happy” to allow Ranking Member Devin Nunes (R-CA) to exceed his opening statement to read the transcript Trump released Friday, but signaled that it was not good enough:</p>
      <blockquote>First of all, I’m grateful the president has released the call record. I would now ask the president to release the thousands of other records that he has instructed the State Department not to release, including Ambassador Taylor’s notes, including Ambassador Taylor’s cable, including George Kent’s memo, including documents from the Office of Management and Budget about why the military aid was withheld.</blockquote>
      <p>“Mr. Chairman, I want you to release the four transcripts from the depositions,” Jordan began, prompting Schiff to say, “the gentleman will suspend,” wielding the gavel.</p>
      <p>“That’s my point of order, “Jordan added.</p>
      <p>Schiff dismissed Jordan and continued, accusing the president of “obstructing the impeachment inquiry.”</p>
      <p>“We would ask the president to stop obstructing the impeachment inquiry, and while we are grateful he has released a single document, he has nonetheless obstructed witnesses and their testimony and the production of thousands of thousands of other records,” he claimed.</p>
