      <p>A war of words has broken out after an MSP told Flamingo Land owner Gordon Gibb to “jog on” during a debate about the future of a proposed £30million holiday park in Balloch.</p>
      <p>Green MSP Ross Greer laid down a gauntlet to Mr Gibb and sales boss Andy Miller, who was put in charge of the Balloch project ,during a debate in parliament last week.</p>
      <p>But Flamingo Land responded by accusing local politicians, who mounted strong objections to the now withdrawn development on a brown field site at West Riverside, of spreading misinformation and being “primarily only interested in preserving their small majorities at the next election”.</p>
      <p>During the debate last Tuesday, watched by members of the Save Loch Lomond campaign, the Green MSP said: “All I can say to Gordon Gibb, who I know will be watching – is that this inexperienced politician and the community campaign I stand with have beaten you at every turn so far. Why don’t you just cut your losses and jog on?</p>
      <p>“Flamingo Land have repeatedly told locals – often in a patronising manner – that there is no alternative. That their plan is the only way to prevent misery and unemployment in the Vale of Leven. That it’s their resort or Balloch will forever be a neglected derelict wasteland. But the community have other ideas.”</p>
      <p>The MSP is has called for Flamingo Land to ditch an exclusivity agreement and give way to a community buyout.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>In a statement to the Lennox Herald, Flamingo Land hit back and a spokesman said: “The site has been available for 20 years, advertised publicly with no approach from any of the current interested groups. This method of encouraging inward investment is, and always has been Scottish Enterprise’s model.”</p>
      <p>We told last month how members of the community shared their ideas, which included providing glamping pods and a visitor centre, on the proposed land during a meeting in the village.</p>
      <p>The land is subject to an exclusivity agreement with Flamingo Land, a spokesman for the leisure firm said this week: “An exclusivity agreement is standard in these arrangements and is also a matter of law. This is a way of giving the developer some protection that any time, costs and expenses will not be wasted (at least for the period of exclusivity) Flamingo Land have invested hundreds of thousands into this project and changing the current arrangement would be a substantial financial risk to The Litigator.”</p>
      <p>Ross Greer continued: “The most unpopular planning proposal in Scottish history isn’t dead yet, and that’s something that needs to be understood at the highest levels of government. I’m glad to have given MSPs the opportunity to discuss this ridiculous application, as well as the appalling behaviour of Flamingo Land over the last few years and our successful campaign to see them off, so far.</p>
      <p>“We know that the community have dozens of better ideas that the destructive, unnecessary and unwelcome resort Flamingo Land proposed. It’s time this rabble cut their losses and jog on. The community have been crystal clear that the site’s future should be in their hands and I’ve been proud to fight their corner every step of the way. I’m more confident than ever that together we are going to save Loch Lomond.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Flamingo Land proposed developing the holiday park at West Riverside and Woodbank House including a 60-bedroom apart-hotel, 32-bedroom budget accommodation, self-catering units, private houses and apartments.</p>
      <p>But National Park planners recommended they be rejected and the application was then withdrawn.</p>
      <p>Flamingo Land bosses reiterated that this was because of three specific points which they say are now being addressed.</p>

      <p>A spokesman from Flamingo Land said: “The local political class are very good at saying what they don’t want but unable to tell us what they do want’.</p>
      <p>“The protesting local politicians are primarily only interested in preserving their small majorities at the next election. “Unfortunately, whipping-up a negative campaign against the development has given them the political capital that they crave.</p>
      <p>“The genuine social and economic benefits to local people have been sacrificed in favour of political posturing and phoney PR.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Flamingo Land was delighted to learn that all the misinformation and false statement regarding the development has been recognised by the National Park Planning Authority along with traffic concerns.</p>
      <p>“The development was recommended for refusal on these issues only: size and scope of hotel; too many log cabin bases; Development in Drumkinnon wood not acceptable.</p>
      <p>“We dutifully respect the decision and are actively working to address the above three parts.</p>
      <p>All other points issues and accusation have been resolved acceptably to the National Park Planning Authorities very high standards.”</p>
