      <h1>Dubai named the world's second best city to drive in</h1>
      <h2>New survey is based on congestion, infrastructure and drivers' behaviour</h2>

      <p>Dubai is the second best city in the world for driving, according to a new survey. The research, from Mister Auto's 2019 Driving Cities Index, takes into account which cities have the safest roads, how congested the roads are and what public transport is like. Dangerous roads had a "road rage score" and were judges on how many fatalities there were per 100,000 people. If you're interested, Ulaanbaatar in Mongolia comes out on top when it comes to road rage. What you might be interested to hear is that Dubai is the second best city for driving, after Calgary in Canada and just ahead of Ottowa in the same country. The worst cities were named as Mumbai, the aforementioned Ulaanbaatar, Kolkata, Lagos and Karachi. So there you are, happy driving!</p>
