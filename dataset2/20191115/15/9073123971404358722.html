        <b>Fortnite players are fed up with the lack of communication from Epic Games and are signing a petition to bring back the Fortnite patch notes.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Six weeks and several patches into Fortnite Chapter 2 have brought us a total of 0 Fortnite patch notes from Epic Games. The community is stirring, with repeated posts to Reddit and Twitter complaining about the lack of communication from the developer.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Players have reverted to relying on community-driven <a href="https://fortniteintel.com/fortnite-v11-11-unofficial-patch-notes/27679/">unofficial Fortnite patch notes</a> to find out what’s changed, but we’re almost certainly missing some smaller changes that are difficult to notice.</p>

      <p>The worst part of all of this is that Epic hasn’t told us anything. They’re acting like nothing’s changed and haven’t given us any reason behind their lack of Fortnite patch notes and an apparent freefall of overall communication.</p>
      <h3>We want patch notes</h3>
      <p>The Fortnite news account <a href="https://twitter.com/FNBRHQ">@FNBRHQ</a> has created a <a href="https://www.change.org/p/epic-games-bring-back-patch-notes-fortnite?recruiter=917431766&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;utm_campaign=tap_basic_share">Change.org petition</a> to bring back the Fortnite patch notes. As of this writing, the petition has over 9,700 signatures and counting.</p>

      <p>The number of signatures on this topic is enough to raise eyebrows, but that might be it. Epic knows that we want the patch notes and don’t seem to care.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>“Patch Notes are crucial for the future of the game, and it’s something that unites the developer, (in this case Epic Games) and the player base,” the petition states.</p>
      <p>“If the players of the game are not informed on what changes are being made, their decisions will remain private and therefore, the game won’t be able to evolve or improve. Players can’t judge a change if they haven’t been informed of it.”</p>

      <p>Although the petition shows the overwhelming desire for the return of Fortnite patch notes, it isn’t likely to sway Epic Games. The player base is passionate about this issue, but was seemingly more passionate about the removal of mechs in Season X. We saw how that played out.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Will we ever see the patch notes again? None of us know for sure. I’d guess that we will and that Epic is keeping everything close to the vest for a limited time.</p>
      <p>Do you think Epic will ever unvault the Fortnite patch notes or are we in for more of the same? Let us know in the comments.</p>
