      <p>PONTIAN, Nov 15 — In a last push effort before going to the polls, Pakatan Harapan (PH) tonight urged Tanjung Piai voters to reject Barisan Nasional (BN) and their racist and religious extremism.</p>
      <p>Johor DAP chief Liew Chin Tong said if PH wins tomorrow, it will send a message that Malaysians reject the slander initiated by the Muafakat Nasional alliance between Umno and PAS.</p>
      <p>“Pakatan’s approach is towards a centrist approach, where we are together with the Malays, Indians, Chinese and Kadazans.</p>
      <p>“At the same time, we fight for all Malaysians. I call upon all of Tanjung Piai voters to determine the direction tomorrow and that direction is towards a centrist road,” said Liew to a crowd of about 300 people at the Pusat Perdangangan Pontian here.</p>
