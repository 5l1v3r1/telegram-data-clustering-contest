      <p>Pam Hamon has run the Mind Jersey shop since 1986. She took up the role after losing her first husband and says she likes being a volunteer.</p>
      <p>The retired civil servant began volunteering for the charity after the shock of losing her husband meant she could not work or drive for a year.</p>
      <p>It was during her recovery that it was suggested she volunteer at the charity, and after working there she was able to return to full-time work at the Taxes Office, volunteering in the shop on Saturdays when Mind Jersey was known as Jersey Focus on Mental Health.</p>
      <p>‘I remember being a customer at the shop and looking for things that would suit my family,’ said the grandmother.</p>
      <p>She explained that with a big team to support the shop at 53 New Street, she has no reason to stop.</p>
      <p>‘It’s not about how many years, it’s about what you can do as a volunteer,’ she said.</p>
      <p>Mrs Hamon now works on Monday and Wednesday mornings, leaving her plenty of time for other activities such as playing bowls.</p>
      <p>Mind Jersey has now merged with Mind UK, but all the money raised in the shop stays in the Island.</p>
      <p>‘People are always very generous, donating things that were hardly used but cost a lot of money,’ she said.</p>
      <p>Mrs Hamon recalled one incident that stuck in her mind:</p>
      <p>‘A gentleman came in once when it was pouring down with rain. He walked to the back of the shop where the men’s attire was.</p>
      <p>‘After he left I spotted a pair of soaking-wet shoes, so he obviously swapped them.</p>
      <p>‘They always say there are people who steal from charity shops, but that was the only time I can say it happened. His need was greater than ours.’</p>
