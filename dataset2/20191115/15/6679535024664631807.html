      <h1>Crash in tobacco prices could impact bypolls in Hunsur</h1>
      <h2>There are around 22,000 growers in Hunsur, they are upset with the govt. for not coming to their rescue</h2>

      <p>The crash in prices of tobacco over the last few weeks has not only led to farmers protesting against the Tobacco Board’s failure to come to their rescue, but it now threatens to cast a shadow on the Assembly bypolls in Hunsur, a key tobacco-cultivating region.</p>
      <p>The annual auction season for tobacco in Karnataka began in the second week of September this year with the produce commanding a reasonably average price across bright, medium, and low-grade varieties of the produce. But, five to six weeks into the auction season, the demand for tobacco plummeted with no takers, particularly for the low-grade tobacco, sparking protests across different auction platforms in Mysuru district.</p>
      <p>According to Mr. Javare Gowda, president of Virginia Flue Cured (VFC) Tobacco Growers’ Federation of Karnataka, the price of low-grade tobacco, which was being purchased for an average of ₹120 a kg, had come down by ₹20 to ₹30 a kg.</p>
      <p>Angry farmers even held up auctions in Periyapatna last week, accusing the government and the board of being soft on traders comprising the cigarette manufacturing companies that were responsible for their plight.</p>
      <p>Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS) and Hasiru Sene, which has taken up the cudgels on behalf of tobacco farmers, said the ire of farmers over the collapse in prices will have a bearing on the December 5 bypolls to Hunsur.</p>
      <p>Of the 48,000 licensed tobacco growers in the State, as many as 22,000 are from Hunsur, according to senior Tobacco Board officials. Each licence is linked to a family of three to five adults, besides the labourers engaged to work on their farms. In addition, there are about 5,000 to 6,000 unauthorised growers of tobacco in Hunsur, said Mr. Gowda.</p>
      <p>More than 2.2 lakh people are eligible to cast their votes in Hunsur Assembly segment in the coming bypolls, which is expected to be an acid test for former Minister A.H. Vishwanath, who, after resigning as JD(S) MLA in July, is now entering the fray as the BJP candidate. He will be challenged by Congress’ H.P. Manjunath, a two-time MLA, and JD(S) candidate Somashekar.</p>
      <p>KRRS leader Badagalapura Nagendra said farmers’ issues invariably have a bearing on elections and the plight of tobacco farmers will be no exception. The farmers will show their anger at the polling booth, he warned.</p>
      <p>The Tobacco Board officials suspect that the protests by tobacco farmers were “politically motivated” and stoked by leaders of the Opposition parties to capitalise on the mood of the farmers.</p>
      <p>However, board officials admitted that the price of low-grade tobacco had dipped and the reason was attributed to an increase in its output due to heavy rains and the high yield in areas along the banks of Lakshmanthirtha and other tributaries of the Cauvery in the region. With auctions also commencing in Guntur in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, the traders had more than one option for purchasing tobacco.</p>
      <p>Board officials said the prices of tobacco had begun stabilising in the third week of November and hoped that the farmers would get better prices soon.</p>
