      <p>FRANKFURT, Nov 15 — Sprawling 12-brand German car giant Volkswagen said today Markus Duesmann would take the helm at high-end subsidiary Audi, also joining the group-wide executive board.</p>
      <p>The former BMW purchasing chief and engineer will head Audi from April, hoping to secure a turnaround at the struggling manufacturer — long one of the VW group’s flagships.</p>
      <p>Duesmann, 50, “will do everything in his power to leverage the full potential of the Audi brand”, VW chief executive Herbert Diess said in a statement.</p>
      <p>At BMW and previously Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler, Duesmann also headed development in the high-end manufacturers’ Formula One teams.</p>
      <p>On top of leading Audi, the new boss’s role on the board will include overseeing research and development across the VW group, taking over the portfolio from Diess.</p>
      <p>Under departing head Bram Schot, Audi reported falling sales, revenues and operating profits over the first nine months of 2019.</p>
      <p>It suffered more than other German manufacturers from the introduction last year of the new WLTP emissions testing standards in the European Union, which created bottlenecks in production.</p>
      <p>Audi has also ramped up spending on new technologies, including battery-electric and hybrid vehicles, connectivity and autonomous driving.</p>
      <p>Group-wide, VW plans to spend some €60 billion (RM275 billion) on research into such future technologies by 2024, it announced separately today, with 75 electric and 60 hybrid vehicles planned in the next decade.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile increased labour costs have also weighed on Audi’s bottom line.</p>
      <p>With the global auto market slowing, Audi recently slashed the night shift in two of its factories, without letting any of its employees go.</p>
      <p>And the firm also had to pay last year an €800 million fine over its role in the “dieselgate” emissions cheating scandal that has dogged VW since 2015.</p>
      <p>Its engineers are suspected of having helped developed software used to make cars emit less pollutants under lab testing conditions than on the road. — AFP</p>
