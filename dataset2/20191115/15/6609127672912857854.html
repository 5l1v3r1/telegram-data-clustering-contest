        <b>RANGERS fans are furious that 'fantasist' fan 'Champagne Jill' Sharp appears to have snapped up a cup final ticket - but others are convinced it's a fake.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Punters fumed after convicted stalker Sharp, 32, posted on social media claiming she had tickets for the Betfred Cup showdown with Celtic.</p>

        <figcaption>Jill Sharp enraged Rangers fans by posting confirmation of cup final tickets</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>She uploaded a screenshot of an email from Rangers appearing to confirm she had been allocated a brief, captioned: "Yeeeeeee haaaaaaaa. Let's gooooo."</p>
      <p>Sharp served time after being blasted in court over her "deliberate and malicious" <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4492771/rangers-champagne-jill-sharp-jailed-stalking/">stalking campaign against a fellow Gers-supporting couple</a>.</p>
      <p>She admitted causing pal <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/3985670/fantasist-rangers-fan-jill-sharp-fenian-abuse-online/">Margaret and Steven Paton</a> fear and alarm between January 2014 and August 2017.</p>
      <p>Fans who reckoned her past should have earned her a ban from Ibrox were furious she had managed to secure cup final tickets.</p>
      <p>One said: "Jill Sharp getting a ticket for the final is wrong. She should have her season taken off her.</p>
      <p>"When you think what <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14923/rangers/">Rangers</a> ban people for (the Killie thing being the most recent) is a scandal.</p>

      <p>"She terrorised a lovely couple through the Rangers connection."</p>
      <p>Another wrote: "The couple were ST holders and no longer attend games because of fear of bumping into her.</p>
      <p>"Rangers FC should revoke her ST, she’s taken the club into disrepute etc.</p>
      <p>"Getting a ticket for the CF ain’t her fault, that’s down to the system. Ban her prob solved."</p>
      <p>Another added: "Fly b*****d has probably had someone use her season book and away allocations while shes been away f*****g shockin either way."</p>
      <p>But some poured cold water on the post by claiming the email had been photoshopped.</p>
      <p>One said: "Look at the ‘Rangers Number’ column... Why is Mr Hale’s number in a red font. While Ms Sharp’s number is blue with a weblink line underneath it. PHOTOSHOPPED."</p>
      <p>Another added: "It’s defo photoshopped."<br/>We told how Gers legend <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4944103/rangers-fantasist-champagne-jill-victim-novel-andy-goram/">Andy Goram has thrown his weight behind</a> a new book by a victim of Sharp.</p>
