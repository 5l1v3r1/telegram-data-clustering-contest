      <p>This may be music to many people's ears out there: <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/bm-is-selling-a-christmas-musical-doormat-sensor/">Christmas</a> tunes may be bad for your health, apparently.</p>
      <p>A psychologist has claimed that listening to too much festive tracks can actually cause stress triggers.</p>
      <p>British clinical psychologist Linda Blair said that listening to Christmas music on loop in the car or at stores reminds people of all their daily stresses.</p>

      <p>Stores are beginning to introduce their Christmas playlists but Blair said that retail workers are most at risk of being mentally drained by the songs.</p>
      <p>She said that more prolonged exposure to the tunes causes a mental strain for employees and irritates shoppers.</p>
      <p>Blair told <a href="https://news.sky.com/uk">Sky News</a>: "It might make us feel that we’re trapped. Music goes right to our emotions immediately and it bypasses rationality. [So] It’s a reminder that we have to buy presents, cater for people and organise celebrations."</p>
      <p>Speaking about retail workers, she added: "People working in the shops at Christmas have to [tune out] Christmas music because if they don’t, it really does stop you from being able to focus on anything else.</p>

      <p>"You’re simply spending all of your energy trying not to hear what you’re hearing."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, if you're a fan of Jingle Bells, Last Christmas and We Wish You A Merry Christmas, you may want to pick up B&amp;M's £4.99 doormat sensor which plays festive songs.</p>
      <p>The sensor detects when someone stands on a doormat and starts playing Christmas songs.</p>
      <p>One shopper posted about the find on the Facebook group Extreme Couponing &amp; Bargains UK and laughed: "This is amazing, lol."</p>
      <p>They shared a clip of the sensor to show off some of the tunes shoppers can expect to hear if they bag one for themselves.</p>
