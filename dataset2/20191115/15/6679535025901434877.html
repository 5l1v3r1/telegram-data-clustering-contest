      <p>The State Human Rights Commission will monitor the ongoing police investigation on the suicide of IIT student Fatima Latheef, SHRC member D. Jayacandran has said.</p>
      <p>During informal chat with the reporters here on Friday, Mr. Jayachandran said the case pertaining to the suicide of IIT student Fatima Latheef had been transferred to the Central Crime Branch for investigation after the information collected from the victim’s mobile phone had indicated that a professor could be the reason behind the student taking the extreme step. The SHRC would monitor the investigating agency’s probe.</p>
      <p>On its part, the State Government, besides ensuring better counselling for the students, should form a committee to formulate the norms to ensure better relationship between the students and the faculty members, he opined.</p>
      <p>The SHRC, as it met here on Friday, took the cases pertaining to the alleged assault of a TNSTC conductor in a moving bus by two policemen near Moontradaippu and alleged harassment and assault of student Lois Sofia by the police after she was picked-up at Thoothukudi airport following alleged altercation between her and then BJP president Tamilisai Soundararajan at the airport.</p>
      <p>As Sofia’s father Samy filed an affidavit, the copy was given to the police so that they can come prepared for the cross examination posted for December 23. On the case pertaining to delay in laying the Maanjolai Road, the officials had been directed to get the mandatory permission from the departments concerned including the State Planning Commission at the earliest so as to complete the work within a month.</p>
