      <h1>Ryan Murphy Says Cast of “Scream Queens” is All in for a Revival; Urges Fans to Tell Fox They Want It</h1>

      <p>After two seasons that aired between September 2015 and December 2016, the <b>Ryan Murphy</b>-created slasher-comedy series <b>“Scream Queens”</b> was axed by Fox back in 2017. And while there was once a time when a show’s cancellation meant that it was never coming back, that isn’t exactly the case anymore. So what are the chances “Scream Queens” gets revived?</p>
      <p><a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/american-horror-story-season-10-spoilers-ryan-murphy-ahs-1984-interview-season-finale-ratched-hollywood-streaming-dates-1202785704/">Speaking with Deadline this week</a>, Murphy noted that while the ball is entirely in Fox’s court, he and the main cast of the series would jump at the chance to bring it back to life.</p>
      <p>“<i>I would have to say that the answer to that lies in the studio who made it</i>,” Murphy told the site. “<i><b>Emma [Roberts] said she would do it, Lea Michele said she would do it, Jamie Lee Curtis, Abigail Breslin, Billie Lourd are all in.</b> So it would depend if Fox wants to do it. I think we’d all do it. I think we’re waiting for them to call us</i>.”</p>
      <p>Murphy continued, “<i>I know the show is very popular and had a real spike in popularity on Hulu. That was another one when we were making it; I don’t know if time has caught up to it, or it takes a while for people to get things, but yes, I’d be up for it. <b>The fans should write Fox and say they want this, Fox Studios and the network</b></i>.”</p>
      <p>As always, if you want it, make sure you’re letting the right people know!</p>
