      <h1>Wada vice-president claims she was spied on after Russia banned for state-sponsored cheating</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T15:10:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 15:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/ben-rumsby0/" target="_blank">Ben Rumsby</a></address>
      <p>Companies 'acting on behalf of Russian interests' spied on the vice-president of the World Anti-Doping Agency and her family after the country was banned for state-sponsored cheating, according to a new book about her time at the organisation.  </p>
      <p>Linda Hofstad Helleland, a vocal opponent of Wada’s decision to lift the suspension imposed on its Russian counterpart, made the claim in <i>Clean Sport, Dirty Games</i>, which was published on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Norway’s Minister of Children and Equality, who steps down from Wada at the end of the year after losing out to Witold Banka in the battle for the presidency, also revealed she was afraid of sleeping on her own at night during a meeting in September last year to decide whether to bring Rusada in from the cold.</p>
      <p>That was three months after Hofstad Helleland claims to have been approached by her country’s secret service (PST) at a conference in Oslo and told that she was being monitored.</p>
      <p>She wrote: “Two people from PST, a man and a woman with grave looks on their faces, came to the Grand Hotel. We sat on a rococo sofa in a lounge on the second floor; me with my hands on my lap, leaning forward while looking at them questioningly. The PST people got straight to the point. I was told that several Norwegian companies were monitoring me and family on behalf of Russian interests.”</p>
      <p>She added: “I knew that foreign interests requested information about government ministers – and as vice-president of Wada (the World Anti-Doping Agency) I was extra vulnerable – but that Norwegian companies were involved in this kind of espionage was quite frightening.</p>
      <p>“I stayed cool and calm, listened to the advice from PST. My thoughts span in my head like a flock of startled birds. I wondered who on earth it could be, and who I had spoken to recently. Meetings, emails and messages raced through my head. I knew many companies that worked closely with politicians. I pondered over what I had said to whom, and what the Russians wanted to know.”</p>
      <p>Russia is facing a fresh ban from world sport for manipulating drugs testing data, with a crunch meeting on the matter scheduled for Sunday.</p>
