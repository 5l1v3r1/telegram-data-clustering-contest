      <h1>Runaway win for Tamil Nadu</h1>
      <h2>Minnows Tripura flounder against the southern powerhouse</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T15:50:40+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 15:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/M-R-Praveen-Chandran-119344/" target="_blank">M R. Praveen Chandran</a></address>
      <p>Tamil Nadu was ruthless in its annihilation of minnows Tripura in the Syed Musthaq Ali T20 cricket tournament at the Sports Hub here on Friday.</p>
      <p>The southern powerhouse cantered to an eight-wicket win — its fourth in the tournament — after Tripura managed just 79 for eight in the 20 overs.</p>
      <p>Washington Sundar (46) and B. Aparajith (33 not out) put on 72 runs for the first wicket as Tamil Nadu won with seven overs to spare.</p>
      <p>Sai Kishore bowled a dream first over in which he took wickets off his first two deliveries as Tripura started on the wrong foot.</p>
      <p>T. Natarajan joined the fun by knocking out Udiyan Bose's off stump. Thereafter it was a steady procession and at nine for seven, Tripura's own record for lowest score (30) was under threat.</p>
      <p>However, Dinesh Karthik chose to bowl out his two successful bowlers much to the relief of the Tripura batsmen.</p>
      <p>Saurabh Das (44) and Neelambuj Vats (28) began the repair work slowly. The eighth-wicket stand added 70 runs. But cricket was staid with Saurabh and Vats unleashing the odd big shots.</p>
      <p>However, Saurabh flexed his broad shoulders in M. Ashwin's last over to add a few useful runs.</p>
      <p>Tamil Nadu openers Washington and Aparajith were unhurried and the wayward Tripura attack presented them with enough scoring opportunities.</p>
      <p>Washington was the more aggressive of the two and played elegant shots against the medium-pacers. Aparajith slowly found his touch as Tamil Nadu cruised towards the target.</p>
      <p>However, the quick wickets of Washington and M. Ashwin came against the run of play and reduced the margin of defeat.</p>
