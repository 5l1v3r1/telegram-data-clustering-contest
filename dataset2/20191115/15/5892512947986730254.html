      <p>Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) flyweight Veronica Macedo was ruled medically unfit to compete against Ariane Lipski at the upcoming UFC Fight Night 164 mixed martial arts (MMA) event, which takes place tomorrow night (Sat., Nov. 16, 2019) inside Ibirapuera Gymnasium in Sao Paulo, Brazil, live on <a href="http://go.web.plus.espn.com/c/482924/595608/9070?sharedid=MMAMania&amp;subId1=xid:fr1573748915673hgd%7Cxid:fr1573752079299aab%7Cxid:fr1573831161399dgi">ESPN+</a>.</p>
      <p>Headaches were to blame, as reported by <a href="https://lasueur.com/veronica-macedo-ufc-sao-paulo-15-11-2019">Lasueur</a> (via <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/11/15/20966254/ariane-lipski-ufc-sao-paulo-veronica-macedo-out-isabella-padua">MMA Fighting</a>).</p>
      <p>The promotion was somehow able to scare up a late replacement in the form of Isabela de Padua; however, “Belinha” was unable to make the flyweight limit on such short notice, tipping the scale at 130.5 pounds.</p>
      <p>The result was a fine equaling 30-percent of her fight purse, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/guicruzzz/status/1195355827743469570">Guilherme Cruz</a>, which is kind of shitty since she’s doing them a solid, but I’m sure the promotion will cover that cost. I can’t imagine why they didn’t make this a catchweight fight, unless Lipski turned it down.</p>
