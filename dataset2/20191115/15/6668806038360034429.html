      <p>Ayushmann Khurrana has been on a roll lately with back to back hits at the box-office. In fact, his last release Bala is his 7th consecutive hit in a row which is a remarkable feat on its own. Just this morning, the actor shared a new poster of his upcoming venture Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan along with revealing the new release date, which is February 21. Interestingly, Vicky Kaushal’s Bhoot will be hitting the screens on the same date as well so the clash of these stars would definitely be something to watch out for.</p>

      <p>Talking about Bhoot, a source close to the film shared some inside details about the project during an interview with a leading daily. He said, “Vicky Kaushal is foraying into the horror genre for the first time. The fact that 'Bhoot...' is based on a true incident that happened in Mumbai, got him excited about it. This film is not for the faint-hearted and unlike the horror-comedies we've seen, it will revolve around a 'ghost ship' that washed ashore on the coast a few years ago.” While Shubh Mangal Zyaada Savdhan on the other hand, is a film in which the audience will witness a gay love story. Along with Ayushmann, the film also stars Neena Gupta and Gajraj Rao in key roles.<br/><br/>Let us know in the comments for which of the two films are you more excited for?</p>
