      <p>Yep, that's right: the game that made me fear the sound of helicopters is coming to Xbox One and PlayStation 4 next year, so even more people can experience the nudist, rock-bashing <s>trauma </s>fun. Hurrah!</p>
      <p>Announced last night during Microsoft's X019 presentation, survival sim Rust is arriving on consoles sometime in 2020, although we don't yet know key details such as whether cross-play will be a feature. Things could get interesting if a batch of fresh newbies are released onto PC servers.</p>

      <p>Developed by Facepunch and released in 2013, Rust has consistently been doing well on Steam - with player numbers reaching a concurrent player peak of over <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/252490">93k back in July</a>, with around 8m players in total. It's a game of complete anarchy and resource-grabbing, with highly aggressive bears and equally aggressive players. Having said that, I've also had some very stupid adventures in Rust, including an episode <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-09-11-a-tale-of-revenge-and-murder-in-rust">where my friend and I went on a revenge murder spree</a>.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, in other X019 news, we've just published our big interview with Xbox boss Phil Spencer on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-15-the-big-xo19-interview-xbox-boss-phil-spencer">Game Pass, streaming and the ever-mysterious Project Scarlett</a>, which is well worth a read.</p>
