      <p><a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/slipknot-everything-you-need-to-know">Slipknot</a> have announced their very own music cruise – and it’s coming to Europe in 2020.</p>
      <p><i>Knotfest At Sea</i> will set sail from Barcelona in Spain on August 10 and return to port on August 14. Slipknot will play two sets onboard the ship, with additional artists and additional high seas experiences set to be revealed in due course.</p>
      <p>Shawn ‘Clown’ Crahan says: “Barcelona, a big-ass ship and the sea. You, us – you’re not going to want to miss it.”</p>
