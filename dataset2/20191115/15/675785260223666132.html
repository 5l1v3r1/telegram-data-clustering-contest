      <h1>Chelsea boss Frank Lampard 'concerned' over form of goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga</h1>
      <h2>The world's most expensive goalkeeper has taken over Spain's no.1 jersey but his club form has flattered to deceive since his summer arrival from Athletic Bilbao last year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T15:36:13+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 15:36</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/frank-lampard">Frank Lampard</a> is desperate to bring Shay Given to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> in a bid to address the concerning form of goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga.</p>
      <p>Given worked with Lampard at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/derby-county-fc">Derby</a> last season, and the Irishman has stayed with the Rams for this campaign after Chelsea chiefs blocked his move to Stamford Bridge.</p>
      <p>Coaches Jody Morris and Chris Jones followed Lampard to the club, but <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/shay-given">Given</a> was denied the chance to join them, with Henrique Hilario promoted instead.</p>
      <p>Chelsea were keen to retain some form of continuity amid all the managerial changes, with former goalkeeper coach Massimo Nenci leaving along with ex-boss Maurizio Sarri.</p>
      <p>But according to <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7687131/Chelsea-boss-Frank-Lampard-make-Shay-Given-amid-concerns-Kepa-Arrizabalaga.html">the Mail</a> , Lampard is still hopeful of adding Given to his backroom team and wants the ex-Newcastle stopper to work closely with Kepa.</p>

      <p>The 25-year-old is yet to really stamp his authority at Chelsea following his £71.6 million transfer last summer from Athletic Bilbao.</p>
      <p>There are concerns over his form despite him being recently being handed the no.1 jersey for Spain ahead of Man Utd's David de Gea.</p>
      <p>Under particular scrutiny is Kepa's ability at set pieces, while only <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/burnley-fc">Burnley</a> have conceded more goals out of the top half teams so far in the Premier League this season.</p>

      <p>Given, 43, was happy to remain at Pride Park where he is now working with current Derby boss Philip Cocu, though the Rams are struggling in the bottom half.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile striker Olivier Giroud has emerged as a target for Borussia Dortmund.</p>
      <p>The Frenchman has had limited minutes in a Blues shirt this season, and could leave the club in January.</p>
      <p>He has made just six appearances, and Chelsea are thought to be willing to sell for £5 million, with Inter Milan also among the interested clubs.</p>
      <p>Giroud is into the last year of his contract, but is hopeful of forcing a move through before next summer in an attempt to earn a call-up to France's Euro 2020 squad.</p>
