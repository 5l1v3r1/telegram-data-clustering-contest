      <p>Sokolov's lawyer, Aleksandr Pochuyev, who was by his client's side during the trip, told reporters that Sokolov's defense had requested such strong security measures as the helmet and vest.<br/><br/>"In order to avoid a possible [attack], the defense requested unprecedented safety measures. The Investigative Committee undertook the measures to exclude possible threats; all nearby streets were blocked and a bullet-proof vest and a helmet were put on Sokolov," Pochuyev said.</p>
