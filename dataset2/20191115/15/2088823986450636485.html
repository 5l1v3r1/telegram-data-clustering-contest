      <p>One of the sweetest shows this television season is the new Monday night CBS romantic comedy “Bob Hearts Abishola.”</p>
      <p>It is about a middle-aged man (Billy Gardell of “Mike and Molly”) who owns a sock factory and falls for the immigrant nurse from Nigeria (Folake Olowofoyeku) who took care of him when he was treated for a heart attack in a Detroit hospital.</p>
      <p>I can’t say it is packed with as many laughs as most other series from producer Chuck Lorre (“The Big Bang Theory,” “Mom”), but it has so much heart dealing with the immigrant experience that you can’t help but root for it to succeed.</p>
      <p>My favorite Lorre series is “The Kominsky Method,” which stars Michael Douglas and Alan Arkin and just started airing Season 2 on Netflix. The second season takes a dark turn, but I loved it even more than the first season and wished more than eight episodes had been made. I didn’t want it to end.</p>
      <p>But I digress.</p>
      <p>Back to “Bob Hearts Abishola.”</p>
      <p>Most of the laughs come from Abishola’s co-workers and family members rather than the series co-leads.</p>
      <p>The show is also part of one of the most noticeable and positive trends this TV season: The number of positive interracial relationships and friendships portrayed. The trend isn’t new, but it has become more noticeable this season.</p>
      <p>Some people might note it is evidence of how the younger generations are more open to interracial relationships than their parents or grandparents.</p>
      <p>I almost hesitated to write about the trend because the fact it has gotten so little attention indicates how much progress has been made from the days when an interracial kiss on “Star Trek” in 1968 between William Shatner (Captain Kirk) and Nichelle Nichols (Commander Nyota Uhura) was considered controversial.</p>
      <p>It also wasn’t that long ago the hit comedies based in New York City, “Seinfeld” and “Friends,” were criticized for failing to live up to the diversity in the Big Apple because Jerry, George, Kramer, Elaine, Phoebe, Rachel, Monica, Chandler, Joey and Ross didn’t have any significant friends who were not white.</p>
      <p>The power and benefits of diversity clearly are the winners this TV season.</p>

        <figcaption>The new ABC comedy “mixed-ish,” a prequel to “blackish,” revolves around the children of a mixed-race couple played by Mark-Paul Gosselaar and Tika Sumpter. (ABC/Eric McCandless)</figcaption>

      <p>The star of “All Rise,” the new CBS legal drama, Simone Missick as new Judge Lola Carmichael, notably and symbolically keeps a picture of Uhura in her office. Lola’s friendly relationship with a white defense lawyer, Mark Callan, played by Wilson Bethel, is at the heart of a series with a strong diverse cast. The series is pretty routine by law show standards, but the positive relationships among the diverse characters is its strong point.</p>
      <p>The new ABC mystery drama “Emergence,” co-created by Western New York native Michele Fazekas, features a divorced but friendly couple. Allison Tolman plays a white police chief formerly married to a character played by Donald Faison, the African American actor who co-starred in “Scrubs.”</p>
      <p>I wasn’t a big fan of the pilot, but the twists in the mystery surrounding the young child (Alexa Swinton) found by Tolman’s character have helped it emerge as a strong series.</p>
      <p>In ABC’s “Stumptown,” lead actress Cobie Smulders (“How I Met Your Mother”) quickly is in the embrace of an African American detective played by Michael Ealy. Their characters seemed destined to be together at times. Smulders smolders in every scene she is in, and the show is being labeled a hit, but I’ve yet to be taken in by all the hype.</p>
      <p>Early in the Fox drama “Almost Family,” viewers learned the character played by Brittany Snow used to date a classmate’s African American husband. I found the pilot about an unethical fertility doctor who fathered numerous children so ridiculous I haven’t seen another episode to know where the show has gone.</p>
      <p>In the pilot of the new CW drama “Nancy Drew,” Nancy (Kennedy McMann) is dating a character played by a black Scottish actor, Tunji Kasim.</p>
      <p>In the upcoming reboot of "Mad About You," which premieres next week on Spectrum cable, African American actress Kecia Lewis plays a therapist who is the wife of Richard Kind's character, Dr. Mark Devanow.</p>
      <p>Of course, the new ABC comedy “mixed-ish,” a prequel to “blackish,” revolves around the children of a mixed-race couple played by Mark-Paul Gosselaar and Tika Sumpter.</p>
      <p>In this season of ABC’s “The Good Doctor,” Dr. Sean Murphy (Freddie Highmore) is slowly discovering romance and learning how to use emojis by dating a co-worker played by Jasika Nicole, a mixed-race actress.</p>
      <p>In NBC’s “New Amsterdam,” series lead Ryan Eggold plays the hospital head who has a strong friendship with Dr. Helen Sharpe, a doctor played by Freema Agyeman, a black English actress.</p>
      <p>It is such a strong friendship I suspect many fans are hoping the widowed Dr. Max Goodman (Eggold), who lost his wife during childbirth at the start of this second season and is raising baby Luna by himself, ends up in a romantic relationship with Sharpe.</p>
      <p>Max resisted Helen’s offer to help with the child in a recent episode, but TV series often delay what viewers yearn for weeks, months and even years before they happen.</p>
      <p>Think Ross and Rachel on “Friends.”</p>
      <p>The advertising community has also embraced interracial couples, with numerous ads matter-of-factly showing them in commercials. It was only six years ago that a Cheerios ad featuring a biracial family provoked such an ugly reaction that the comments section on the YouTube video of the advertisement was disabled by the company that makes Cheerios.</p>
      <p>The positive focus on interracial relationships is one of the best things about the new television season and illustrates that television, thankfully, has moved light years away from the days of “Star Trek.”</p>
