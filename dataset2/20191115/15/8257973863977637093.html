      <p>Nov. 15 (UPI) -- The owner of a traveling petting zoo said a kangaroo is on the loose in Mississippi after escaping from her enclosure.</p>
      <p>John <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Mark_Johnson/?tps=1">Mark Johnson</a> said the 4-year-old female kangaroo <a href="https://www.wtva.com/content/news/Search-underway-for-missing-kangaroo-in-Lee-County--564937892.html">hopped a fence</a> in Guntown about 3 p.m. Tuesday and was last seen about 5:30 p.m. that same day.</p>
      <p>"She's possibly in Guntown, Saltillo -- you might even broaden it to maybe Baldwyn or Tupelo," Johnson<a href="https://www.djournal.com/news/kangaroo-on-the-loose-in-lee-county/article_280dec02-7511-5b0b-bdd3-32d66c0bb576.html"> told the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal</a>. "I'm not sure where exactly she is."</p>
      <p>Johnson, who owns G&amp;J Traveling Petting Zoo, said the kangaroo is not currently a part of his attraction because "she's not real friendly."</p>
      <p>The owner warned members of the public not to attempt to approach the 50- to 60-pound animal, and instead alert authorities.</p>
      <p>Johnson said he has been attempting to search for the kangaroo with a <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/drones/?tps=1">drone</a>, but rough winds have been causing his battery to drain quickly.</p>
