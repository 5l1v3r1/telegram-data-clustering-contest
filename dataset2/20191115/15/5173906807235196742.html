        <b>An earthquake with magnitude 3.8 on the Richter scale was felt late this morning (15 November) on Faial Island, said the Azores Regional Civil Protection and Fire Service (SRPCBA).</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to the Azorean Civil Protection, which cites the Azores Seismovulcanic Information and Surveillance Centre (CIVISA), the earthquake was "recorded at 12:01pm local time (plus one hour in Lisbon) with magnitude 3.8 on the Richter scale and epicentre about 31 kilometres west / southwest of Capelo on the island of Faial".</p>
      <p>According to information available so far, "the earthquake was felt with maximum intensity IV on the Modified Mercalli scale in Capelo and Castelo Branco, and with intensity III / IV on the Angústias and Matriz, municipality of Horta", was communicated.</p>
      <p>The western zone of Faial has been registering since 3 November "a slight increase" of seismic activity, with all events "with epicenter at sea", as explained to the president of the Azorean Seismovulcan Surveillance and Information Centre (CIVISA).</p>
      <p>“It is one of the many seismogenic zones of the archipelago and since November 3rd, around 4pm, there has been a slight increase in seismic activity in this seismogenic zone, located west of Faial, with a distance between 25 and the 35 kilometres of the island”, said Rui Marques earlier this month, adding that" this is the third increase in seismic activity in this sector this year".</p>
