      <h1>Heineken no longer major shareholder of Sabeco - VnExpress International</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T15:47:43+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 15:47</time> by <a rel="author">VnExpress</a></address>
      <p>The shares, equivalent to an approximate 0.81 percent stake, were sold to buyers whose identity were not disclosed via an agreement, the Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange (HoSE) reported.</p>
      <p>The sale was worth over VND1.2 trillion ($51.79 million), at a price of VND234,000 ($10.1) per the Saigon Beer Alcohol Beverage Corp (Sabeco) share (ticker: SAB), VND18,000 ($0.78) lower than its stock opening price Friday, according to HoSE.</p>
      <p>On the stock market, SAB shares had been falling or stalling consecutively for 12 sessions.</p>
      <p>The remaining 4.32 percent stake in the Vietnamese brewer are being held by Heineken, its regional subsidiary Heineken Asia Pacific, and related companies.</p>
      <p>Sabeco is owned 53.59 percent by Vietnam Beverage, a subsidiary of Thai beverage company ThaiBev. The <a href="https://e.vnexpress.net/news/business/companies/trade-ministry-denies-sale-of-top-brewery-shares-to-chinese-investors-3991398.html">Vietnamese government</a>, represented by the Ministry of Industry and Trade, owns a 36 percent stake in the company.</p>
      <p><a href="https://e.vnexpress.net/news/business/companies/vietnamese-beer-sales-now-drive-revenues-for-sabeco-s-new-thai-owner-3886185.html">Thaibev</a> had bought its stake in Sabeco when the government publicly auctioned it out in December 2017. At the time, Heineken, who had held shares in Sabeco since 2008, also submitted a bid but lost to Thaibev.</p>
      <p>According to a report of securities firm FPTS Securities, Heineken’s share of the Vietnam beer market at the end of 2018 was 23 percent, second to Sabeco which held 40.9 percent.</p>
      <p>In its latest financial report, Sabeco reported revenues of over VND28.3 trillion ($1.22 billion) in nine months, up 10 percent year-on-year. Revenue from beer in the period accounted for 86 percent of total, or VND24.3 trillion ($1.05 billion).</p>
      <p>In the third quarter alone, post-tax profit was highest among all brewers in Vietnam at almost VND1.46 trillion ($63 million), up over 40 percent year-on-year.</p>
