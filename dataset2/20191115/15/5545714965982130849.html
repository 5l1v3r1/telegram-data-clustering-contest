      <p>Is it possible to play <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-kingdom-hearts-iii-540069.phtml"><i>Kingdom Hearts III</i></a> with little to no context or history? Yes. I've done it!</p>
      <p>My first-timer experience was a total fever dream, to the point where I'm having a hard time accepting the fact that the game came out <i>this year</i>. I wouldn't necessarily suggest making <i>KH3 </i>your first <i>Kingdom Hearts</i>, but if you do, you're bound to love parts of it, loathe others, and feel a whole range of emotions.</p>
      <p>If curiosity ever gets the better of you (as it did me), there's now a <i>Kingdom Hearts III</i> demo on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0082-CUSA16884_00-KINGDOMHEARTS3TR">PlayStation 4</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/kingdom-hearts-demo-version/9p6q242vbzms?activetab=pivot:overviewtab">Xbox One</a>, and it includes the world I think Disney-loving <i>Kingdom Hearts </i>outsiders will appreciate most: the Toy Box World. That's the one with Woody, Buzz, and a buncha mech toys.</p>
      <p>The demo also features Olympus, which acts as a tutorial. I have a soft spot for <i>Hercules</i>, but nostalgia aside, it's pretty tame. If you end up buying <i>Kingdom Hearts III</i> (especially as we enter sales season), note that only the Olympus save data will transfer to the full game, not your <i>Toy Story</i> progress.</p>
      <p>It's astonishing that this series is allowed to exist. Good on you, Nomura.</p>
