      <h1>Apple TV+, News+, Music Bundle Could Arrive in 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T15:10:36+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 15:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macobserver.com/author/charlotte-henry/" target="_blank">Charlotte Henry</a></address>
      <p>An Apple services bundle, comprising of TV+, Music, News+ and perhaps other services may soon be on its way. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-14/apple-mulls-bundling-digital-subscriptions-as-soon-as-2020"><i>Bloomberg News</i></a> reported Thursday that Apple could unveil the package in 2020.</p>

      <h3>Apple TV+ And Other Services Set to be Included in Bundle</h3>
      <p>A bundle offer has been expected since the services were unveiled. It is understood that Apple at least left some leeway with News+ publishers to incorporate them into any such package. According to sources cited in the report:</p>
      <blockquote>A provision that Apple included in deals with publishers that lets the iPhone maker bundle the News+ subscription service with other paid digital offerings.</blockquote>
      <p>However, it is worth noting that in October the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/85967cd2-e86b-11e9-a240-3b065ef5fc55"><i>Financial Times</i></a> reported music labels were resistant to being included.  Talks were still said to be at an early stage” at that point.</p>
