      <p>Its minister, Maszlee Malik, said the MOE would also be in constant contact with Wisma Putra for any further action should the situation becomes critical.</p>
      <p>“At the same time, the MOE via Education Malaysia Beijing will continue to closely monitor the situation in Hong Kong and report any updates.</p>
