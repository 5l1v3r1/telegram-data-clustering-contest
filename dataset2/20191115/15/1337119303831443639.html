      <h2>Let’s Go players get a special gift</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20962722/pokemon-sword-shield-review-nintendo-switch-launch-date"><i>Pokémon Sword</i> and <i>Shield</i></a><i> </i>introduce <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/16/20917122/pokemon-sword-shield-giant-gigantamax-pikachu-meowth-g-max-move">Gigantamax forms</a>, supersized versions of pokémon that can be activated during specific battles for more powerful attacks. While all pokémon are capable of turning into towering monsters, only a few have special forms. That includes Pikachu and Eevee, which players can snag for free with a save file from <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fbrowse%2Fvideo-games%2FPokemon-Lets-Go-Pikachu%2F2636_7899038_2127706_5389425&amp;subid1=theverge%7Cxid:fr1573680264652ffe"><i>Pokémon: Let’s Go, Pikachu!</i></a> and <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fbrowse%2Fvideo-games%2FPokemon-Lets-Go-Eevee%2F2636_7899038_2127706_7397454&amp;subid1=theverge%7Cxid:fr1573680264652bhf"><i>Let’s Go, Eevee!</i></a></p>
      <p>In addition to special moves only available in Gigantamax forms, certain pokémon also get a small makeover. (Pikachu, for example, fills out into his iconic <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/fat-pikachu">fat Pikachu</a> look of old.) Pikachu and Eevee are available at the game’s Wild Area Station via the game’s online functionality. Players will need to save from <i>Let’s Go, Pikachu!</i> or <i>Let’s Go, Eevee!</i> to grab whichever pokémon corresponds to their save file. Once you reach the station, look for the pair of kids in the corner.</p>
      <p>Data from those games can be from any point in play, rather than being a completed file. It’s also worth noting that while the Wild Area is accessible fairly early in the game, it’s still likely to take a few hours to reach.</p>

      <p><i>Sword</i> and <i>Shield</i>’s other Gigantamax forms include pokémon like Charizard, Meowth, and Butterfree. Meowth in its original form — not be confused with its extra furry Galarian form — is available as an early purchase bonus for players via the Mystery Gift options from November 15th, 2019, to January 15th, 2020.</p>
