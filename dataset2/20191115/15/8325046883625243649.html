      <p>Some of Apple’s launch shows for its new streaming service, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-apple-tv-plus-will-struggle-in-the-streaming-war-2019-10">Apple TV Plus</a>, have been <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/disney-plus-the-mandalorian-beats-apples-shows-in-audience-demand-2019-11">lagging in audience demand</a> since they debuted on November 1. But “Dickinson” is starting to gain major traction.</p>
      <p>The series, starring Hailee Steinfeld as the 19th century poet, recently broke through <a href="https://www.parrotanalytics.com/">Parrot Analytics’</a> top 10 most in-demand original streaming shows. Parrot Analytics <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/top-netflix-shows-this-week-bojack-castle-rock-2019-11">measures “demand expressions,”</a> the company’s globally standardized TV demand measurement unit that reflects the desire, engagement, and viewership weighted by importance.</p>
      <p>“Dickinson” was the only Apple TV Plus show in the top 10 for the week of November 6 to November 12. Two days before Apple TV Plus’ launch on October 30, “For All Mankind” <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/disney-plus-the-mandalorian-beats-apples-shows-in-audience-demand-2019-11">was leading Apple’s shows in demand</a>, according to Parrot Analytics, meaning “Dickinson” has surged since it premiered.</p>
      <p>Apple TV Plus debuted with eight original shows and one documentary film, but its mainly touted four prestige dramas: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-tv-plus-morning-show-director-reported-budget-is-overblown-2019-10">“The Morning Show,”</a> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apples-see-director-wants-to-return-for-next-hunger-games-2019-11">“See,”</a> “For All Mankind,” and “Dickinson.”</p>

      <p>“Dickinson” and “For All Mankind” are the best reviewed for the four, with 71% and 72% Rotten Tomatoes critic scores, respectively. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/morning-show-director-had-to-pass-on-hbos-watchmen-2019-10">“The Morning Show”</a> has a 63% and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/review-apple-tv-plus-see-is-an-entertaining-fantasy-series-2019-10">“See”</a> has a 41% critic score.</p>
      <p>“‘Dickinson’ shows promise in a number of areas – among them striking visual language, an irresistible playfulness in the music supervision, and a sense of fun, if not humor, that pervades even scenes about mortality or misogyny,” RogerEbert.com’s <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/demanders/apple-tv-offers-goofy-exuberant-take-on-emily-dickinson">Allison Shoemaker wrote</a>.</p>
      <p>“The Morning Show,” which Apple pushed as its flagship launch series, was the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/disney-plus-the-mandalorian-beats-apples-shows-in-audience-demand-2019-11">least in-demand Apple series</a> leading up to the service’s launch, according to Parrot Analytics. The show initially <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews-apple-tv-plus-the-morning-show-is-dull-underwhelming-2019-10">suffered from terrible reviews</a>, but its critic score has improved since its premiere.</p>
      <p>Apple’s upcoming original shows include <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/m-night-shyamalan-apple-tv-plus-series-servant-details-release-2019-10">M. Night Shyamalan’s thriller “Servant”</a> and “Truth Be Told,” starring Octavia Spencer and Aaron Paul.</p>
      <p>The service costs $4.99 a month, but is free for anyone who buys a new Apple device.</p>
      <p>Without a library of licensed content and very few originals, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-apple-tv-plus-will-struggle-in-the-streaming-war-2019-10">it’s still a lackluster deal</a> compared to Disney Plus, which launched this week for $6.99 a month and a library that includes content across Disney’s popular properties like “Star Wars,” Marvel, and Pixar.</p>
      <p>But Apple TV Plus could get a boost, as <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/former-hbo-ceo-richard-plepler-reportedly-in-talks-with-apple-2019-11">former HBO CEO Richard Plepler is in talks to join the service</a> in an exclusive production deal.</p>
