      <h1>Box Office Report: 'Bala' remains steady while 'Marjaavaaan' and 'Motichoor Chaknaoor' fail to pull the audience</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T15:44:02+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 15:44</time> by <a rel="author">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p>Sidharth Malhotra, Riteish Deshmukh and Tara Sutaria's 'Marjaawaan' has been the talk of the town. And the film has hit the theatres today.</p>
      <p>According to an early report on BoxOfficeIndia.com, the film had a decent start of around 20-25% as it opened well in mass centres. Reportedly, the film has opened to good collections in Nizam, CP Berar, Maharashtra and Gujarat and there will be support from UP and East also. The opening is also far better than recent Siddharth Malhotra films.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Nawazuddin-Siddiqui">Nawazuddin Siddiqui</a> and Athiya Shetty's 'Motichoor Chaknachoor' opened to low collections. The Hollywood releases 'Ford V Ferrari' and 'Charlies Angels' have opened far better. The former is not even dubbed in Hindi but has more than double the collections of 'Motichoor Chaknachoor'.</p>
      <p>Well, the film which is still pulling audience to the theatres is <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ayushmann-Khurrana">Ayushmann Khurrana</a>'s <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/'Bala'">'Bala'</a>. Even on the eight day, the film has showed steady collections. However, it still has to go a far to cross Ayushmann's 'Dream Girl'.</p>
