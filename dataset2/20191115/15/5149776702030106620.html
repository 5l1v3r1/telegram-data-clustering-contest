      <h1>Nottingham Winter Wonderland's ice rink now has three difficulty levels and there's even bigger plans in the pipeline for next year</h1>
      <h2>As with skiing there are now green, red and black 'runs'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T15:51:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 15:51</time> by <a rel="author">Rachel Gorman</a></address>
      <p>Whether you are a wobbly-kneed novice or could give <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/whats-on-news/who-torvill-dean-you-need-2323892">Torvill and Dean</a> a triple Axel for their money, there's a place to skate for all levels at Nottingham's new and improved Winter Wonderland ice rink.</p>
      <p>Taking inspiration from the slopes, the East Midlands' largest outdoor ice rink is now (unofficially) divided into three different difficulty levels, described by organisers as similar to the concept of green, red and black 'runs'.</p>
      <p>Opened today in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/old-market-square">Old Market Square </a>(November 15) the 1160 square metre rink now has a 5 metre by 16 metre kids' ice rink for the little ones, its usual rink for all and a new 200m square ice path around the fountains, installed at an incline to add a little challenge to the more experienced skaters.</p>
      <p>Stewards will be supervising all areas and if anyone looks like they are struggling will be on hand to help.</p>
      <p>Visitors can skate from the age of four but children’s skate aids and lockers are limited, available at the skate hire desk only on a first-come-first-served basis.</p>
      <p>Tickets can be booked in advance at nottinghamwinterwonderland.co.uk, priced £10.50 per child, £40 for a family ticket and £13 for adults.</p>
      <p>Even bigger plans are in the pipeline for coming years (perhaps even 2020) with Edward Mellors, a director of Mellors Group which organise Winter Wonderland in partnership with the city council, hoping to extend the rink even further.</p>
      <p>He said: "I've always wanted to have an ice path going around Old Market Square, I think it would be a great experience for everyone. Can you imagine going past the council house? I definitely want to do it. Maybe next year, who knows?"</p>
