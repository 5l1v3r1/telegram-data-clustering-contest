      <p>Many know that the Xiaomi TV 5 is already out. Moreover, many of them are thinking this is another high-end TV and that’s all. But it’s not so. The new Xiaomi TV brings a lot of new features. One of them is the sound wave recognition function. Of course, it’s still in the testing stage, but we are sure this feature will come to the TV products via updates in the nearest future. Today, Xiaomi TV department general manager Li Xiaoshuang introduced how this function works. Though it’s in Chinese, we still recommend you to watch the video below.</p>
