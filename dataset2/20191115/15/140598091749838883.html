      <h1>Horse trainer killed herself in wake of son's suicide just months before husband died in car accident, inquest hears  </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T15:56:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 15:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/jamie-johnson/" target="_blank">Jamie Johnson</a></address>
      <p>A professional horse trainer killed herself in the wake of her son’s suicide, just months before her husband died in a car crash, an inquest has heard.</p>
      <p>Faith Done, 55, said she wanted to be “reunited” with her son Alastair, 26, after he was found at a beach in Aberdeen earlier this year. He sent his mother a text message saying: "I'm gone, no-one contact me" sparking a major police operation, which ended when officers found his body.</p>
      <p>Last May, just a month after an inquest coroner ruled Alastair had taken his own life, Mrs Done who organised horse shows and trained animals at her stables in Malpas, Cheshire was found dead in her hallway by her husband Nick as he returned home from work.</p>
      <p>Nick, 53, later gave a statement to police about his wife's death but in a tragic twist he was himself killed in a car crash last month whilst on his way to work. An inquest into his death is due to be held later.</p>
      <p>The family is survived by another son, Andrew, 29, who wrote in a Facebook post: "Words can't describe the way I feel right know, my heart is broken my world has been ripped from me. </p>
      <p>“I love you Dad and I really hope there is a heaven where you can be with mum and Alastair."</p>

      <p>The Warrington hearing into Mrs Done’s death was told the series of family tragedies began on January 4 this year when Alastair, who worked in polo yards, disappeared after buying a one way rail ticket to the Scottish coast.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Mr Done a farmer's labourer said: "Faith had always drank alcohol but when Alastair died she started drinking a lot more.</p>
      <p>"She refused all help and stated she didn't need it and put on a brave face.</p>
      <p>"The month before she passed away we had a conversation about taking a lot of pills and going to sleep together due to Alastair taking his own life and she said she wanted to be with him.”</p>
      <p>Recording a conclusion of suicide Coroner Heath Westerman, said: "Faith Done was a horse show producer and the conclusion in the circumstances is one of suicide. I extend my sincere condolences to her remaining family and friends."</p>
      <p>Last month an inquest opened into the death of  Mr Done who died instantly when his Mini collided head-on with a Volkswagen on the A525 Whitchurch Road in Bangor-on-Dee on October 2. Another person was seriously injured after both vehicles caught fire.</p>
