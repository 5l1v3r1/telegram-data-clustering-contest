      <p>With an opening night 0-0 draw with Zambia and then a 1-0 win over Ivory Coast, David Notoane’s side have put themselves in a good position to progress into the final four of the competition, with the top three all booking their spot in Tokyo.</p>

      <p>The South Africans need just a point against Nigeria this evening in order to make sure they reach the last four where they will play either Egypt or Ghana, but Teboho Mokoena – the hero against Cote d’Ivoire – says they want all three points in Cairo this evening.</p>
      <p>Mokoena told SAFA.net, “We played really well against Ivory Coast in our previous match and Nigeria is another side that we will need to manage as well… We have been solid at the back in our previous two group games while pressing forward to create scoring chances of our own. The same approach will be applied in this tie, as we also want to win this game as well.”</p>

      <p>The game between South Africa and Nigeria’s U23s will get underway at 20h00 this evening, while the Ivorians take on Zambia at the same time as all four teams in the group look to try and make sure they’re in the semifinals come the end of this evening. </p>
