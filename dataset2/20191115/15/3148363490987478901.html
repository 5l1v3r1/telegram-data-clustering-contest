      <h1>Donald Trump: I Fired Marie Yovanovitch Because She 'Turned Bad'</h1>
      <h2>President Donald Trump on Friday defended his decision to fire former Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, saying that she had “turned bad.”</h2>

      <p>“Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “She started off in Somalia, how did that go?”</p>
      <p>Yovanovitch’s first tour was in Mogadishu, Somalia and was installed in Ukraine during the Obama administration. Trump recalled her in May 2019.</p>
      <p>The president recalled his phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky where President Trump described Yovanovitch as “bad news.”</p>
      <p>During her testimony from the House Intelligence Committee, Yovanovitch said she felt “threatened” by the president’s comments in that phone call, and was shocked that a U.S. President would undercut her personally in a phone call with a foreign leader.</p>
      <p>But Trump reminded Americans that Zelensky agreed with his assessment, citing concerns she favored the previous president of Ukraine.</p>
      <p>“[T]he new Ukrainian President spoke unfavorably about her in my second phone call with him,” Trump added on Twitter.</p>
      <p>President Trump repeated he had the right to call her back to the United States.</p>
      <p>“It is a U.S. President’s absolute right to appoint ambassadors. They call it ‘serving at the pleasure of the President,'” he said.</p>
      <p>Trump defended his renewed foreign policy in Ukraine without Yovanovitch, saying it was much tougher than under former President Barack Obama.</p>
      <p>“The U.S. now has a very strong and powerful foreign policy, much different than proceeding administrations,” he wrote. “It is called, quite simply, America First!”</p>
