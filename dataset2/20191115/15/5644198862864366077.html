      <p>BEIJING: A floating dead pig infected with African swine fever washed up in Taiwan last week, according to a UN report, which also recorded a fresh mainland China outbreak and an attempt to illegally transport infected pigs.</p>
      <p>China's swine herd has been devastated by the outbreak of the disease, first reported by the government in August last year.</p>

      <p>An update on the crisis from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations dated Thursday (Nov 14) said the dead pig was found floating on Nov 6 near Taiwan's Xiaojinmen Island - also known as Lieyu - close to the mainland province of Fujian.</p>

      <p>It said the pig tested positive for the same strain of swine fever that has unleashed havoc in mainland China.</p>
      <p>The FAO said this is the first floating dead pig reported since June, and pointed out that the last reported outbreak in Fujian was last December.</p>
      <p>The report also documented that a vehicle illegally transporting infected piglets across provinces was intercepted earlier in November on an expressway in the southwestern municipality of Chongqing.</p>
      <p>There was also a fresh outbreak in China's southwestern Yunnan province this month, the FAO said, totalling 163 outbreaks in 32 provinces and regions.</p>
      <p>Beijing has been battling to get a grip on the crisis, which has sent pork prices soaring.</p>
      <p>Around one million pigs have been killed since the first outbreak of swine fever last August, according to official statistics, but that is widely considered to be an underestimate.</p>
      <p>One pig farmer told AFP last month that some affected farmers were quietly selling or disposing of dead pigs rather than declaring them to the government.</p>
      <p>A Rabobank report has warned China could lose 200 million pigs during the epidemic.</p>
      <p>Prices of pork - which is the staple meat in China - have more than doubled in the past year, according to China's National Bureau of Statistics.</p>

      <p>Data last week showed China's consumer prices grew at their fastest rate in almost eight years in October, driven by a spike in pork prices.</p>
      <p>China's top economic planner said on Friday it will release frozen pork reserves to the market at "an appropriate time".</p>
      <p>Beijing will also step up efforts to boost hog production through central budget support, Meng Wei of the National Development and Reform Commission said, according to state news agency Xinhua.</p>
      <p>The UN has also documented cases of swine fever in neighbouring Asian countries, including three new cases among wild pigs in South Korea.</p>
