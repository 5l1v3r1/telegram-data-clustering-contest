      <h2>Save money on a new screen for your PC or laptop. These are the best discounts on monitors in the early Black Friday sales.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T12:37:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 12:37</time> by <a rel="author">Jim Martin</a></address>
      <p>Whether you want to add a second monitor or are thinking of upgrading an old display, you’ll find some great deals right here.</p>
      <p>Unlike some products, monitor deals tend to be quite short-lived so if you see something that suits, don't hang about. And that advice definitely applies to Black Friday deals which have started already. </p>
      <p>If you hesitate, you'll probably return to find the discount has ended, or the retailer has run out of stock. There are some good discounts around right now, and some retailers - including Currys PC World - have already said prices won't go any lower on Black Friday itself.</p>
      <p>In any case, a new monitor will probably have better colour accuracy, better contrast and viewing angles and typically a higher resolution than your old one, so it's a great upgrade for your PC or laptop.</p>

      <h3>Best monitor discounts: what to look for</h3>
      <p>You’ll need to decide two things first: your budget and what size screen you’d like. You should measure your desk and the available space. And if you’re going for one the ultra-wide 21:9 models, be sure to check the width on the manufacturer’s website as they can take up a lot of horizontal space.</p>
      <p>With that decided, consider what you will use the monitor for. This will determine which screen technology you should choose. For example, if the monitor for gaming you’ll want a TN or VA panel for the fastest response times. But some IPS displays can also be suitable if you don’t plan to play first person shooters where response time is so important.</p>
      <p>IPS and VA generally have accurate colours and good contrast ratios, but IPS has the best viewing angles.</p>
      <p>It’s possible to find budget IPS screens, and we recommend you seek these out rather than a TN-based monitor because image quality should be much better. Of course, you should also read monitor reviews as well, and never judge a screen purely on specifications.</p>
      <p>Other factors to bear in mind include whether you need your new monitor tadro have a VESA mount for wall or multi-monitor stand mounting and whether you want it to be able to rotate to a portrait orientation as not all do. Similarly, look for height adjustment to avoid having to put the monitor on an extra stand (or pile of books) to get it to the right height.</p>
      <p>Finally look at the ports and connections and make sure the monitor has the inputs you require. If you’re buying a 4K monitor, you’ll need a DisplayPort output on your laptop or PC as most HDMI outputs won’t be up to the task. However, if you have a recent PC or laptop it might just have the HDMI 2.0 port required.</p>

      </p>
      <p>This 28-inch 4K monitor also supports HDR and AMD FreeSync. It's currently <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=2690&amp;awinaffid=254429&amp;clickref=06-3686624-19-0000000&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebuyer.com%2F910955-benq-el2870ue-28-4k-hdr-monitor-9h-lgtlb-fse">discounted to £199.96 on Ebuyer</a>.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Despite the fact it has AMD Freesync, this 27in monitor isn't really aimed at gamers. Thanks to 4K HDR support, it's best suited to those who either want to watch HDR content or create it.</p>
      <p>It has USB-C, DisplayPort and HDMI inputs, and it's a good deal with this much money off.</p>
      <h4>4. Samsung LS34J550 Quad HD 34" Ultrawide monitor</h4>

      </p>
      <p>Ultrawide monitors are great for gaming and unlike quite a few of the 'cheap' 21:9 models, this one has a 3440x1440 pixel resolution. And that makes a big difference over the 1080p versions you'll find.</p>
      <p>It's only a 60Hz model, but that's acceptable at this price.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Use the coupon FLASHSALE to get the discount. And at the lower price it's a good deal if you're after a 144Hz monitor for gaming.</p>
      <h4>6. Samsung S27F354 Full HD 27" LED Monitor</h4>

      </p>
      <p>Don't be too swayed by the inclusion of Freesync (the refresh rate is only 60Hz and you need a compatible AMD graphics card) but at this price, the F354 is a good deal.</p>
      <p>If you can take advantage of Freesync, it's a good budget choice for 1080p gaming.</p>
      <h4>7. Acer Predator Z321Q 31.5" G-Sync monitor</h4>

      </p>
      <p>You can take that original price of £744.90 with a pinch of salt. However, this is still a decent chunk off the usual selling price of £499.</p>
