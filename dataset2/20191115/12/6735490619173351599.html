      <p>Onstage to accept his award, Bad Bunny spoke out about the general lack of nominations for artists in the popular reggaeton genre.</p>
      <p>“There’s so many things to say. I know they’re probably going to cut me off, screw them,” <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/latin-grammys-2019-bad-bunny-speech-reggaeton-snubs.html">he said</a>. “But to all the musicians, to all the people who belong to the Academy: With all my respects, reggaeton is part of Latin culture, and it’s representing, just like lots of other music genres, Latinos around the world.”</p>

      <p>He continued, “Also, I tell my colleagues from reggaeton, let’s make an effort; let’s bring back creativity and sincerity. The genre has become about views, numbers. Let’s turn things around and do genuine things and different things for the people.”</p>
      <p>Bad Bunny also took the stage at the end of the show to perform his new single “Callaíta”.</p>
