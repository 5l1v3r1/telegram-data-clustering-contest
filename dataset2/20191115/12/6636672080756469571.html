      <p>The head of BT has said Labour’s £20 billion costing is half what the real cost will be.</p>
      <p>Owners of private networks like Virgin have asked where does a competing, free service leave them.</p>
      <p>The plan to raise the £230 million annual running costs of British Broadband from taxing the American digital giants looks problematic – given the difficulties in the past of taxing these companies.</p>
      <p>The plan to connect the most remote houses to fibre first looks particularly uneconomic because the remote areas produce the least revenue.</p>
      <p>There seems to be no plan to integrate 5G into British Broadband where cellular would be a cheaper connection option than fibre.</p>
