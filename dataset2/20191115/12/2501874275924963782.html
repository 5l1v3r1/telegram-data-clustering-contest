      <p>The Planning Commission discussion of the Goleta Train Depot 2019 Station Area Master Plan(SAMP) has moved to the meeting of December 9, 2019.</p>
      <p>The Goleta Train Depot Project (Project) is the development of a new multi-modal train station at the location of the existing Amtrak platform with the intent to increase rail ridership and reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. Through the completion of a full-service station, the project will improve connections to bus transit, accommodate transit service to/from the Santa Barbara Airport and the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB), add new bicycle and pedestrian facilities, and allow accommodation for potential future additional train storage that will support increased commuter rail needs. These improvements will create a new safer, more functional, and inviting rail station in Goleta. The Project site is adjacent to the existing Amtrak platform at the northern end of South La Patera Lane.</p>
      <p>The completed Goleta Train Depot Station Area Master Plan (SAMP) examines the existing site, surrounding area characteristics, and the existing mobility network, and includes recommendations informed by public input for on-site and off-site accessibility improvements to create a successful multi-modal train depot. It was prepared by collecting and utilizing community input, examining the opportunities and constraints of the Depot and surrounding area, and reviewing the existing mobility network. Subsequent phases of the Project include the preliminary architectural and engineering design of facilities and infrastructure, environmental review and analysis, the acquisition of additional transit vehicles, and construction of the Depot and off-site improvements, including enhanced bicycle and pedestrian improvements along La Patera Lane (as a separate project).</p>
      <p>The SAMP is the initial phase of the new Goleta Train Depot Project. It is intended to determine the appropriate recommendations and provide guidelines to be implemented in the design of a successful multi-modal train Depot. The consulting firm of Anil Verma Associates, Inc. has been brought on board to lead the design process for the Goleta Train Depot. Future public meetings will be scheduled during this process to provide the public with opportunities to provide input.</p>
      <p>The Planning Commission staff report with Station Area Master Plan will be available at least 72 hours prior to the meeting at: <a href="https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDAsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAxOTExMTIuMTI3OTIzMTEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Rpbnl1cmwuY29tL0dvbGV0YU1lZXRpbmdzIn0.bnTSTWUM6yl-mNG5VveE8kt6J59-MSHcsboMCG5rB2g/br/71265676147-l">https://tinyurl.com/​GoletaMeetings</a></p>
