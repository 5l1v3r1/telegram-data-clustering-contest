      <p>India’s trade deficit widened less than estimated last month, as a third-straight month of decline in exports offset a sharp plunge in imports amid weak global demand conditions.</p>
      <p>The gap between exports and imports was at $11 billion in October from $10.9 billion in September, data released by the Commerce Ministry showed Friday. That was lower than the median estimate for a $11.9 billion deficit in a Bloomberg survey of 20 economists.</p>

        <li>While a global slowdown and U.S.-China trade dispute are among reasons for waning demand, India this month opted out of a pan-Asian trade deal that would have paved the way for the economy’s integration with the rest of the region</li>
