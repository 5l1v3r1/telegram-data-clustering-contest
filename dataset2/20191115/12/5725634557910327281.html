      <h1>Weekly Dividend Boosts: 58 For November 11 And Beyond</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T12:05:51+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 12:05</time> by <a rel="author">Fredrik Arnold</a></address>
      <p>Summary</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Barron's Weekly posts a list of stocks announcing "dividend payment boosts" on the very last page of its financial data section. Here is your dog catcher 11/11/19 update.</li>
        <li>Last week, Barron's listed 58 stocks boosting dividends. The increases ranged from $.000004 per month to $.95 semi-annually, and ranged from 0.092% to 475.0% for this batch.</li>
        <li>Energy and real estate sector stocks most populated the high yield top 10, however, financials, consumer cyclical, funds, healthcare, communication services, technology, and industrials supplemented the top twenty.</li>
        <li>10 top dividend-boosting stocks ranged from 12% to 144% in net gains calculated from broker targets plus dividends less broker fees.</li>
        <li>$5k invested in this week's lowest-priced five top-yield dividend-boosted  dogs showed 25.75% more net gain than that from $5k invested in all 10.  Little, lower-priced dividend-boosted dogs ruled this mid-November pack.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Foreword</h3>
      <p>Any collection of stocks is more clearly understood when subjected to yield-based (dog catcher) analysis; these dividend-boosted batches are perfect for the Arnold dog catcher process. Here is your November 11 data from Barron's for 58 dividend-paying stocks supplemented by dog catcher analysis powered by YCharts.</p>
      <p>

          <b>Actionable Conclusions (1-10): Analysts Estimated 12.03% To 144% Net Gains For 10 </b>

      </p>
      <p>Five of 10 top dividend-boosted stocks by yield were among the top ten gainers for the coming year based on analyst 1-year target prices. (They are tinted gray in the chart below.) Thus, this yield-based forecast for these booster dogs was graded by Wall St. Wizards as 50% accurate.</p>

          <b>The Dividend Dogs Rule</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Stocks earned the "dog" moniker by exhibiting three traits: (1) paying reliable, repeating dividends, (2) their prices fell to where (3) yield (dividend/price) grew higher than their peers. Thus, the highest yielding stocks in any collection became known as "dogs." More precisely, these are, in fact, best called, "underdogs."</p>

      <p>To quantify top dog rankings, analyst mean price target estimates provide a "market sentiment" gauge of upside potential. Added to the simple high-yield metrics, analyst mean price target estimates became another tool to dig out bargains.</p>

      <p>$5k invested as $1k in each of the five lowest-priced stocks in the top 10 dividend booster kennel by yield were predicted by analyst one-year targets to deliver 25.75% more gain than $5k invested as $.5k in all 10.

      <p>The five lowest-priced top yield dividend-boosted dogs as of November 11 were: Chesapeake Granite Wash Trust, Uniti Group Inc., Arbor Realty Trust Inc., Oasis Midstream Partners LP, Westlake Chemical Partners LP, with prices ranging from $0.68 to $22.99.</p>
      <p>Five higher-priced dividend boosted dogs as of November 11 were: General American Investors, Enbridge Inc., Sabine Royalty Trust, Cedar Fair LP, AbbVie Inc., whose prices ranged from $38.22 to $68.44.</p>
      <p>The distinction between five low-priced dividend dogs and the general field of 10 reflected Michael B. O'Higgins' "basic method" for beating the Dow. The scale of projected gains based on analyst targets added a unique element of "market sentiment" gauging upside potential. It provided a here-and-now equivalent of waiting a year to find out what might happen in the market. Caution is advised, since analysts are historically only 20% to 80% accurate on the direction of change and just 0% to 20% accurate on the degree of change.</p>
      <p>The net gain/loss estimates above did not factor in any foreign or domestic tax problems resulting from distributions. Consult your tax advisor regarding the source and consequences of "dividends" from any investment.</p>
      <p>Stocks listed above were suggested only as possible reference points for your Dividend Boosted Batch stock purchase or sale research process. These were not recommendations.</p>
