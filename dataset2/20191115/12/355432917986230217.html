      <h1>White House economic adviser: US, China 'getting close' on trade agreement</h1>

      <p>White House economic adviser <a href="https://thehill.com/people/lawrence-larry-kudlow">Larry Kudlow</a> on Thursday said that a trade agreement between China and the United States is growing closer to being finalized, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-kudlow/u-s-and-china-getting-close-to-trade-deal-white-house-economic-adviser-idUSKBN1XO33Q">Reuters reports</a>.</p>
      <p>Kudlow told the audience at a Council on Foreign Relations event that the two sides are "getting close," to a deal, saying that the countries have been recently engaged in "very constructive" talks.</p>
      <p>“The mood music is pretty good," he continued, "and that has not always been so in these things.”  </p>
      <p>The top two global economies have been embroiled in a trade war for more than 15 months, with both country's feeling the sting of opposing tariffs. </p>
      <p><a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a> had hoped to sign "phase one" of the deal at the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Chile this month, but that possibility became unworkable when Chile withdrew from hosting the event earlier in the month, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-kudlow/u-s-and-china-getting-close-to-trade-deal-white-house-economic-adviser-idUSKBN1XO33Q">Reuters reports</a>.</p>
      <p>Last week, Trump said he could rollback some tariffs on China, but <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/finance/469596-trump-rules-out-total-rollback-of-chinese-tariffs">ruled out</a> a total rollback of the levies.</p>
