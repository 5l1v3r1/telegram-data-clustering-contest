      <p>Marjaavaan, starring Sidharth Malhotra, Riteish Deshmukh and Tara Sutaria in the lead roles, releases in cinemas today. The romantic action drama, directed by Milap Zaveri, had audiences looking forward to the release. Judging from the trailers, it seems to be the perfect masala action entertainer. Now, that the film has finally hit the screens, it will be interesting to see if it can live up to the box-office expectations.</p>

      <p>In in an interview with a leading daily, trade analyst Girish Johar claimed that Riteish is the driving point of the film and that it would perform well in the second and third tier cities. Girish also revealed that Sidharth and Riteish’s union on the big screen would work in the film’s favour as well. He also said that Bala’s strong hold at the box-office will not affect Marjaavaan, since the former targets more of an “upper class” audience. He predicted an opening-day collection of Rs 4-5 crore for Marjaavaan.<br/><br/>One negative for the film is that it hasn’t been able to impress the critics too much. Most reviews claim that the over-the-top action scenes and crowd-pleasing dialogue seem forced. Let us know what your predictions for the film’s performance at the box-office are.</p>
