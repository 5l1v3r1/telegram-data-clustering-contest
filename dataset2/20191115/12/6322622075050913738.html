      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 15): Press Metal Aluminium Holdings Bhd today inked an agreement to take up a 25% stake in PT Bintan Alumina Indonesia (PT BAI) for US$80.23 million (RM333.36 million).</p>
      <p>The two companies had on May 31 signed a memorandum of understanding to negotiate the acquisition of the stake, Press Metal — South East Asia’s largest aluminium smelter — said.</p>
      <p>PT BAI is building a million-tonne alumina refinery plant in Indonesia’s Bintan island, with plans for a second phase.</p>
      <p>This, it said, will provide Press Metal with a long-term supply of alumina via the purchase of not less than 50% of alumina produced before completion of the project, and up to 1.5 million-tonnes upon completion of the project.</p>
      <p>With this, reliance on third-party suppliers for alumina needs will reduce considerably, providing stability for Press Metal’s smelting operations, Press Metal added.</p>
      <p>“Together with our earlier acquisition of Worsley, we will be able to cover approximately 80% of our enlarged alumina requirements, moving forward,” said Press Metal group chief executive officer Tan Sri Paul Koon in a statement.</p>
      <p>“This will strengthen us vertically and provide us an edge, as we remove some uncertainties or supply constraints, which could lead to operational disruptions,” Koon said.</p>
      <p>“This is vital, as we are now growing our smelting operations and our new smelter (in Samalaju, Sarawak) is targeted to commence end [of] next year.</p>
      <p>“The location of this asset is in closer proximity to Samalaju as compared to sourcing from Australia, and will enable us to enjoy shorter lead-time and capture considerable logistic cost savings,” he added.</p>
      <p>Press Metal said the US$66.23 million of purchase consideration will be secured through bank borrowings, and the remaining US$14 million via internally-generated funds.</p>
      <p>Shares of Press Metal closed one sen or 0.21% higher at RM4.77, bringing a market capitalisation of RM19.26 billion.</p>
