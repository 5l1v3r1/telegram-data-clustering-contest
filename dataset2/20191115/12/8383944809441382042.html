      <p>This special event showcases works from many different art disciplines including painting, ceramics, video, sculpture, installation, photography, glass and graphic design. The exhibition has been curated by Derya Yücel since its first edition. Yücel has been actively curating exhibitions since 2005 and also continues her career as an art writer. She has published five monographs about renowned artists like Semiha Berksoy to date. On top of that, she is an academic at Istanbul Bilgi University's Art and Culture Management Department. <br/><br/>Speaking to Daily Sabah, the curator told the story of BASE Istanbul. "After the establishment of the platform, I started to collaborate with the founders. I was so excited when I first heard about the project. Since I am in the academic world as a lecturer, I always follow young artists, their creative process and productions," she stated. The founders and the curator formed a team and prepared an exhibit that will host new graduates of the year.<br/><br/>At BASE Istanbul, artwork by young artists is selected by a jury. Then, Yücel presents the works by collecting them within the frame of a subject. "We host 107 artists whose content, form and discipline are different this year. However, I also see their intersecting points. For example, their subjects and artistic aesthetics show some similarities. I apply my curatorial practice upon these intersecting points."</p>

      <p>Yücel defined the curatorial framework of BASE as "Now" this year. She said: "If time is an uninterrupted, dynamic and non-recurring phenomenon moving from one point to another, then 'now' is the moment that connects the past and the future, and at the same time forms boundaries with them. 'Now' is the continuity and connection of time, the memory of the past and the possibilities of the future. 'Now' is the moment where the past meets the future. Art, as a form of knowledge, transfers traces of the past to the future through 'now.' I wanted to share the perspective on how the artists at BASE 2019 look at their present time."<br/><br/>Proposed as a top topic for BASE 2019 selection, "Now" shares the works by the new generation of artists, which naturally center their own world and their "now" and encompasses conceptual, aesthetic and sometimes political orientations such as cultural identity, social memory, personal mythology and fictional self and engulfs various media. It produces a polyphonic, multiple-meaning and dynamic visual encounter, offers a broad, current and contemporary spectrum of visual art education and practices in Turkey.<br/><br/>Highlighting the importance of BASE, Yücel said that half of the graduates of fine art faculties stop art production, and this is something that happens the world over. "Over time art productions decreases, only 10 % continue [of graduates] to make art. However, platforms like BASE carry great importance in terms of supporting artists' productions and being a resistance point for them."</p>
