      <p>Artwork has highlighted the environmental dangers of plastic to budding environmentalists in Tiverton.</p>
      <p>Tidcombe Primary School had a week of creating artwork using plastic waste. </p>
      <p>Year five designed flowers made from plastic bottles and used acrylic paints to cover them in bright and bold colours.</p>
      <p>Year three and four invented slogans to try and encourage people to recycle. They discussed rhyming couplets and worked together to come up words to put on a display involving a turtle’s shell.</p>
      <p>In year two, pupils explored the book ‘Somebody Swallowed Stanley. The story is about a plastic bag which looks like a jellyfish and eventually a turtle gets it stuck in his throat.</p>

      <p>Year two teacher Harriet Gowing said: “Throughout the rest of the week we made lots of different parts of our display in the library. They’re all plastic bottle shapes and represent all the plastic floating in the ocean.</p>
      <p>“We also created some plant pots with the plastic bottles we had left.</p>
      <p>“By the end of the week, we had used almost 20 bags of recycling. We also used newspaper, magazines and recycled card to create sea animals.”</p>
      <p>Pupils also enjoyed finding out how they can help the planet.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Teegan, 7, said: “We have created some posters with an important message to make sure people won’t chuck rubbish in the sea.</p>
      <p>“Some animals think plastic is food, so they eat it, then their babies drink their milk so that then they get plastic in their bodies and can die.”</p>
      <p>Lottie, 7, added: “We have learnt about how not to chuck so much rubbish on the floor and not to use too much plastic.</p>
      <p>“My favourite activity was making the flowers because I liked learning about all different plants and outdoor world.”</p>
