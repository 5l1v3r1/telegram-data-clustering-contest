      <h2>Maya was a paedophile</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T12:15:35+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 12:15</time> by <a rel="author">Charlotte Rodrigues</a></address>
      <p>Actor Matthew Wolfenden, who plays <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/a-short-history-of-emmerdales-david-metcalfe/">David Metcalfe</a> in <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/">Emmerdale</a>, has hinted his character will be single for a while following his ex girlfriend, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/a-short-history-of-emmerdales-maya-stepney/">Maya Stepney</a>, being released from prison.</p>
      <p>Fans of the show know David got into a relationship with school teacher Maya last year as she separated from Liam Cavanagh.</p>
      <p>However things soon took a dark turn when <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-to-kick-off-grooming-storyline-with-maya-and-jacob/">she began grooming his son</a> <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/a-short-history-of-emmerdales-jacob-gallagher/">Jacob Gallagher</a>, who was also her pupil.</p>

      </p>
      <p>For months <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/emmerdale-fans-want-to-throw-up-as-maya-resumes-affair-with-jacob-in-unwatchable-scenes/">she groomed the schoolboy</a> and even slept with him just days after he turned 16.</p>
      <aside>I think it would not only make Jacob wary of a new relationship, but David even more so.</aside>
      <p>Eventually the truth came out about Maya and when she was taken to court, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-fans-predict-maya-stepney-will-be-back-for-revenge-in-explosive-christmas-storyline/">she was sentenced to 12 months in prison</a>.</p>

      <p>However, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/first-look-next-weeks-emmerdale-in-10-pictures-48/">spoilers for next week's episodes</a> have revealed that <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-spoilers-maya-is-released-from-prison/">the paedophile will be released early</a>.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.digitalspy.com/">Digital Spy</a> about whether David will find it difficult to move on from Maya, Matthew said: "Yeah I think he will and I sincerely hope we play that out well.</p>
      <p>"I don't know what's happening at the moment but in the advance scripts that I've got he doesn't jump into bed with the next person - which he's done most of his life on Emmerdale in the last few years."</p>
      <p>The actor added that David has had many short-term flings and he hopes it will change as he becomes wary of getting into a new relationship.</p>

      <p>He said: "I think it would not only make Jacob wary of a new relationship, but David even more so."</p>
      <p>Since the truth came out about Maya, David has had counselling and despite Jacob initially blaming him for Maya going to prison, the pair seem to be getting on better.</p>
      <p>But how will things pan out with Maya's release coming up?</p>
