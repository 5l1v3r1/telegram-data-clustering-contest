      <h1>Tammy Abraham explains what he said to Raheem Sterling ahead of Chelsea's clash with Man City</h1>
      <h2>The England teammates go head-to-head next weekend at the Etihad</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T12:06:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 12:06</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Ha</a></address>
      <p>Fresh from scoring his first senior goal for England, Tammy Abraham says he already has one eye on Chelsea's upcoming Premier League clash at Manchester City.</p>
      <p>The striker came off the bench to score in the thumping 7-0 win over Montenegro on Thursday night, a result which seals England's place in next summer's European Championship.</p>
      <p>The goal at Wembley continued Abraham's fine run of form and capped off a hugely successful year for the forward.</p>
      <p>On loan at Aston Villa, the forward helped Dean Smith's side win promotion via the Championship play-off final in May, before returning to Stamford Bridge in the summer and establishing himself as Frank Lampard's first choice striker at Chelsea.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old is only behind Leicester's Jamie Vardy in this season's goal scoring charts, with 10 goals from 12 league games, and he says he is aiming to add to his tally next Saturday at the Etihad Stadium.</p>
      <p>Chelsea travel to Man City looking to go four points clear of the reigning champions, but Abraham admits it will be a difficult task to take all three points from Manchester.</p>
      <p>"Yeah, it's going to be a tough one. I've been speaking to Raheem [Sterling] about it," he said after the England game.</p>
      <p>"Right now, we're in a good place at Chelsea, so there's no reason why we can't go there and do well and get points.</p>
      <p>"It's been a dream for all of us [Chelsea's young English players]. I remember standing on the Champions League pitch in Lille and talking to Mason [Mount], 'we were in the play-off final last year and now we're in a Champions League game together'.</p>
      <p>"You can only dream of moments like this. We have to get our heads round it, we are where we are today because of hard work, desire and the hunger, so we have to keep that going."</p>
      <p>Abraham also expressed his joy at scoring his first senior goal for England, but criticised supporters who jeered Joe Gomez and urged fans to stick with the team.</p>
      <p>"It's a dream come true, I've always grown up watching England and to be here today and get my first goal, it means the world to me," the Chelsea striker said.</p>
      <p>"It's not about maintaining [level of performance] for this season, but for many years, god willing. I've always believed in myself to score goals. There's still a lot in my game that I need to develop but I can't complain, things are going well.</p>

      <p>"We had the incident today with Joe where we are all England players or fans," he added.</p>
      <p>"We need everyone to be together, times like that we need the fans to lift us up and help us really when we are going into tournaments.</p>
      <p>"We said after the game it was unacceptable we don’t need that really he’s a great player. Things happen in football, things happen between teammates.</p>
      <p>"It’s about dusting yourself down and just moving on. We’ve all moved on from the situation and it’s looking positive."</p>
