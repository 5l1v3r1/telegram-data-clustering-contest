      <p>Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone celebrated their first wedding anniversary in the most special way. The couple got married last year on November 14 according to South Indian customs and on November 15 according to Sindhi rituals at lake Como in Italy.</p>
      <p>To celebrate their first anniversary this year, the couple took off with their families to seek blessings at the Venkateshwara Temple in Tirupati on November 14 and then visited the Golden Temple in Amritsar. The pictures of the couple from their spiritual visits have been floating online and created a mega buzz among their fans. Today, they were spotted returning to Mumbai after their mini trip.</p>
      <p>The couple was snapped at the Mumbai airport with their families, who happily posed for pictures for the paparazzi waiting to catch a glimpse of them. Ranveer and Deepika looked phenomenal as they stepped out in heavy ethnic attires that they had worn for their visit to the Golden Temple earlier this morning. We wish the couple all the love as they complete one year of married bliss. Scroll through their latest pictures.</p>
