      <h2>Here's how the picture looks ahead of Wales' games against Azerbaijan and Hungary</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T12:43:47+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 12:43</time> by <a rel="author">Ian Mitchelmore</a></address>
      <p>Wales face Azerbaijan in their penultimate Euro 2020 qualifier in Baku on Saturday before completing their campaign against Hungary on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>They are the most important matches of Ryan Giggs' reign and this is what they need to qualify for the tournament.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What Wales need</b>
      </p>
      <p>If Wales beat Azerbaijan, they will qualify automatically if they win against Hungary <b>and</b> Slovakia drop points in either of their remaining games against Croatia and Azerbaijan.</p>
      <p>If Wales draw with Azerbaijan, they can still qualify automatically, but they'd need to beat Hungary (claiming a better head-to-head record against them in the process) and hope Slovakia claim no more than two points from their remaining games against Croatia and Azerbaijan.</p>
      <p>Wales can't qualify automatically if they lose to Azerbaijan.</p>
      <p>The Red Dragons will also miss out if Slovakia win their remaining two games.</p>

        <b>What about the Nations League?</b>
      </p>
      <p>To earn a Nations League play-off spot, Wales need one more of Austria, Sweden, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina or Denmark to qualify automatically given that Ukraine and Russia have already secured their place at next year's tournament. This is extremely likely to happen so the Nations League backstop is almost certainly there.</p>
      <p>The play-offs take place in March next year.</p>
