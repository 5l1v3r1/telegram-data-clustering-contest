        <li>Protesters called for scrapping of Pinochet-era constitution</li>
        <li>April referendum on whether to rewrite document and how</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Chilean political parties have agreed to a referendum on replacing the country’s Pinochet-era constitution, in a deal which could help end nearly a month of sometimes violent political unrest.</p>
      <p>The country has been rocked by weeks of demonstrations which began over subway fares and quickly grew into a broader protest over economic inequality and political exclusion.</p>
      <p>Much of the protesters’ anger has focused on Chile’s 1980 constitution, which is seen as the embodiment of Augusto Pinochet’s neoliberal model, prioritizing a market-driven economy but failing to adequately guarantee healthcare, education and pensions.</p>
      <p>After an agreement hammered out in congress early on Friday, a nationwide plebiscite in April will ask Chileans if they want a new constitution – and how it will be drafted.</p>
      <p>Once the draft is complete, the new constitution will be submitted to a second, compulsory referendum for ratification.</p>
      <p>The interior minister, Gonzalo Blumel, said: “This agreement is a first step, but it is a historic and fundamental first step to start building our new social pact, and in this the citizenry will have a leading role.”</p>
      <p>The deal represents a major concession from president Sebastián Piñera, who had previously rejected the idea of a constitutional assembly in favour of drafting a new framework in congress.</p>
      <p>But pressure on Piñera rose this week after a string of arson attacks on landmark buildings and speculation that the army could be called back on to the streets.</p>
      <p>In response, the Chilean government finally warmed to a political compromise, inviting party leaders to discuss protesters’ demands.</p>
      <p>“Overall, this is a good agreement because it represents political consensus and we had reached a dead end,” said Cristóbal Bellolio, a politics professor at Adolfo Ibañez University in Santiago.</p>
      <p>“It means that for the first time in our history we will have a constitution that belongs to all of us, which is the product of a true democratic process – not drafted by a group of six or seven experts and given to us by a dictator,” he said.</p>
      <p>The latest poll from Cadem asserted that 78% of Chileans wanted a new constitution, while a constitutional assembly was the most popular mechanism through which to achieve this.</p>
      <p>“The constitution of the dictatorship has died,” progressive senator and former foreign minister Heraldo Muñoz said after Friday’s vote.</p>
      <p>Although full details of how the process will work remain unclear, Catalina Pérez, the leader of the Revolución Democrática party and one of the document’s 10 signatories, described it as a watershed moment for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/chile">Chile</a>.</p>
      <p>“After more than 25 days of protests, the government was left with no option but to transfer power to the people – this is just the beginning of a fundamental change towards a more equal society,” she told AFP.</p>
      <p>Protesters who had gathered in Santiago’s Plaza Italia on Friday morning suggested that the deal was a step in the right direction, but remained unconvinced by some of the details.</p>
      <p>“Of course it’s a historic moment, but it’s just not enough,” said small business owner Enrique Cisterna, who expressed concern that reforms could still be hobbled by a requirement that every article in the new constitution will require approval by a two-thirds majority in congress.</p>
      <p>Close by, 74-year-old retiree Juan Manuel Lanata held a hand-painted sign underlining his disappointment with the agreement.</p>
      <p>“I believe that it is my duty to come here to register my dissent,” he said. “The two-thirds requirement is absurd – it’s a betrayal of the people! These protests will continue because this deal is not enough.”</p>
