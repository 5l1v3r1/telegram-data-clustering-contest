      <h1>Selena Gomez Calls Out Justin Bieber's Manager Scooter Braun and Scott Borchetta for 'Robbing' Taylor Swift</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T12:35:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 12:35</time> by <a rel="author">Alyssa Bailey</a></address>
      <p>Last night, Taylor Swift <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29804435/taylor-swift-scooter-braun-scott-borchetta-old-music-tv-statement/">posted an open letter</a> on Twitter where she revealed that Justin Bieber's manager Scooter Braun and Big Machine Records' CEO Scott Borchetta were refusing to let her play her old music on TV. Braun purchased Big Machine Records and Swift's entire catalog for her first six albums this summer. Swift <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a28234622/taylor-swift-scooter-braun-letter-tumblr/">made a statement </a>about the purchase then, calling it her "worst case scenario" because of Braun's history "incessant[ly], manipulative bullying" her.</p>
      <p>Selena Gomez broke her silence this morning, posting a statement to Instagram in support of her close friend. She said she didn't care about the consequences of speaking out against two high-powered men in music (one of whom, Braun, manages her ex-boyfriend Justin Bieber). Braun and Borchetta "robbed and crushed one of our best song writers of our time an opportunity to celebrate all of her music with her fans and the world." Gomez called their actions "greed, manipulation, and power" and said all she wants is "a change of heart."</p>
      <p>Below, her full statement:</p>
      <blockquote>My heart is so heavy right now. It makes me sick and extremely angry. (I don’t mind if there may be retaliation) this is my opinion. It’s greed, manipulation, and power. There is no heart or thought of anyone else. No respect for the words my friend has written since she was a 14-year-old in her bedroom. <br/><br/>You’ve robbed and crushed one of our best song writers of our time an opportunity to celebrate all of her music with her fans and the world.<br/><br/>I have known Taylor for 13 years. She is the most dedicated, fearless, fiesty [sic], strongest woman I’ve ever known. People can say bitch but what I’m saying to you is that’s called a woman with true identity and strength who takes no shit. I listened to fearless before it came out and I just remember us jumping on a bed and she was just sparkling. ✨ -so proud of her diary being read by the whole world. Nervous of people not liking it… but that became one of the biggest records - an album that saved so many young woman who felt alone. Have a broken heart. Who were healing. Those who felt invisible. Gave a voice to those who didn’t know that they had one all along. Believing in dreams again. I continued to see how she has constantly challenged her self to create a beautiful life that belong to just her. So I can tell you first hand the MOST important thing to Taylor is her family, love, her fans, and her MUSIC. I really hope there is a change of heart over this unfortunate situation. <br/><br/>Seeing my best friend (or any of my friends) be constantly pulled down is the worst feeling. Taylor fights. She will never stop fighting. People grow from choices. Some will stay exactly the same. I just want a change of heart. I love you.</blockquote>
