      <p>A Los Angeles doorbell camera captured the gut-wrenching screams of a woman police say they believe may have been kidnapped, but it did not capture images of what caused her calls for help.</p>
      <p>Witnesses in the Leimert Park neighbourhood called Los Angeles police Tuesday to report hearing a woman screaming, according to an LAPD news release.</p>
      <p>"Help me," a woman's voice can be heard screaming in the footage, which shows only a dark street from a porch. "Somebody help me, please."</p>
      <p>A car then races into and out of the frame.</p>
      <p>Witnesses saw what police say may be a four-door, white Toyota Prius with plastic wrap over the front passenger side window speed off with two people inside.</p>
      <p>The driver, described as male, was pulling the hair back of a woman with dark braided hair in the passenger seat as she screamed, a witness reported to LAPD.</p>
      <p>The driver was heard shouting, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry," police said.</p>
      <p>"If you have seen or have any information regarding the identity of the female or male in the video, please contact Southwest Area Detectives at 213-485-2197," police said.</p>
