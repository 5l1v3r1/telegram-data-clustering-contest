      <p>A four-year-old girl 'disappeared' as she was walking to school with her mum when she fell down an open MANHOLE.</p>
      <p>Evelyn Walker was lucky to escape serious injury when she plunged into the deep hole - because she managed to cling on to the lid.</p>
      <p>Mum Saffron Walker was walking little Evelyn to school in Burghfield, Berks., when the mishap occurred.</p>
      <p>She was trying to sort out her daughter’s coat and schoolbag when Evelyn just ‘disappeared’.</p>
      <p>The beautician, from Burghfield, had parked by her sister’s home so she could walk around the corner to Mrs Bland’s Infant School.</p>
      <p>She said: “My daughter went to knock on my sister’s door, and I was like, ‘no, come back to the car, I need to get your coat and your schoolbag ready.’</p>
      <p>“She came back to the car, stood on the corner of the drain, and she’s just gone. <br/><br/>“I looked up, and I couldn’t see her.” <br/><br/>Evelyn had tumbled down a six-foot manhole but was clinging on to the lid. <br/><br/>Her foot had become jammed in the drain but the shaken and terrified mum was able to retrieve her.</p>
      <p>She said: “She’s cut her knee open. <br/><br/>“She must have bruises coming out on her back, her arms, her hands. <br/><br/>“I’m surprised she hasn’t got any bruising on her face, because her little face was pressed up against the drain lid.” <br/><br/>Saffron has demanded answers from the council, because of she thinks her daughter was lucky to escape serious injury.</p>
      <p>She said: “I am fuming. <br/><br/>“I just keep replaying Evelyn’s little face in my head.</p>
      <p>"It was horrible how she was looking at me, clinging on for dear life.” <br/><br/>Saffron’s mother Debbie said the manhole had been left exposed during recent works. <br/><br/>She said: “Somebody’s got to take responsibility for this, it’s disgusting. <br/><br/>“A job like this, you’d have to go health and safety to the extreme. <br/><br/>“We could’ve lost a life.”</p>
      <p>A West Berkshire council spokesperson said: "The council made the area around the manhole safe as soon as they were made aware of the incident.</p>
      <p>"It is currently unclear how the damage to the manhole cover occurred, however, we have instructed our contractor to barrier the area off until we are able to make a full repair."</p>
