      <h1>NFL must suspend Myles Garrett for season so undisciplined Browns get the message</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T12:02:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 12:02</time> by <a rel="author">Bill Bender</a></address>
      <p>Baker Mayfield showed the maturity of a franchise quarterback as he tried to put a spin on Myles Garrett hitting Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph in the head with Rudolph's dislodged helmet.</p>
      <p>"The reality is, he's going to get suspended,"<a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/myles-garrett-helmet-swing-baker-mayfield-mike-tomlin-react-browns-steelers/hh1gt6wbmt151tvtnvrxze9oo">Mayfield said</a> after his Browns <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/game-center/cleveland-browns-vs-pittsburgh-steelers/drjs0l6375us5m5fhi32cxsh6">defeated their rival from Pittsburgh 21-7</a>. "We don’t know how long, and that hurts our team. We can't do that. We can't continue to hurt this team. It's inexcusable."</p>
      <p>The correspondingpunishment should be taking Garrett, the team's top defensive player,off the field for the remainder of the 2019 NFL season. It would be a harsh reaction, but perhaps it's what's needed for the Browns' players to finally learn from their actions.</p>

      <p>It does not matter what Rudolph's role in the incident was. It doesn't matter what Pittsburgh center Maurkice Pouncey did in retaliation.The Steelers and Bengals have been down this road, too, but nothing this ugly has happened. This sets a precedent, and the NFL should take full advantage of the opportunity to ensure it never happens again.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Think about what happened. Garrett took off the helmet ofa player who had suffered a scary concussion just six weeks earlier against the Ravens, and then hit that player in the head with it. Rudolph could have been seriously injured. For a league that's trying to preach player safety, there is no justifiable scenario other than Garrett serving a multiple-game suspension. Four games is not enough.Oakland’s Vontaze Burfict was suspended for the remainder of the season after a much less egregious, yet still dangerous, offense in Week 4.</p>
      <p>Burfict has a longer track record, butGarrett had developed a reputation this season for roughing the passer and dirty plays. His actions Thursday cannot be excused by claiming emotion or "heat of the moment." That's simply not good enough.</p>

      <p>Thursday's win should have been a proud moment for a Brownsteam that took its lumps while starting out 2-6 but appearedto be turning a corner to possible playoff contention heading into the final six games of the season. Now, they will likely be without Garrett, who had 10 sacks in 10 games, for some or all of that run.</p>
      <p>"I made a mistake, I lost my cool and I regret it. It's going to come back to hurt our team," Garrett said after the game (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWF3cGKO9VQ">video via Cleveland.com</a>).</p>
      <p>Garrett's actions, however, are just a symptom of a organizationwide condition that has plagued the Browns all season.</p>
      <p>
        <b>IYER: <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/myles-garrett-swing-helmet-mason-rudolph-browns-steelers/l75bap6hzav11a97g48czjl1p">Helmet swing adds to the chaos in Cleveland</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>The reality is Cleveland is an undisciplined football team under first-year coach Freddie Kitchens. It had eight penalties for 121 yards Thursday; for the season, it has 87penalties for 822yards, a record-breaking pace. The flags have contributed greatly to the losing record, and there have been four ejections this season.</p>
      <p>Thelack of discipline came out at the worst possible time against Pittsburgh. Why would Garrett do something like that?</p>
      <p>AFC North games get dirty, but the Browns can't pin this on the Steelers being the antagonist. Not this time. Not when receivers <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/juju-smith-schuster-injury-update-concussion-helmet-to-helmet/qqjho9rjql641h9wjujdkj3x5">JuJu Smith-Schuster</a> and <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/diontae-johnson-injury-update-bleeding-from-ear-hit/15o3lhds5v2th1ctvn8vj2woua">Diontae Johnson</a> left the field earlier in the game with concussions after helmet-to-helmet hits. Certainly not when Garrett ripped off Rudolph's helmet.</p>
      <p>No, Rudolph shouldn't go looking for a fight with his helmet off, but Garrett hit him with that helmet on national television. Maybe that ends up on a few posters and Twitter profiles as people, witha warped senseof pride, try to say the rivalry is back. Nobody should be proud of those actions.</p>
      <p>When you have to ask the question "What if he was killed?"and actually mean it, without being overly dramatic, then that’s a problem.</p>

      </p>
      <p>If Garrett is suspended for the year and the Brownsdon’t make the playoffs, then the incident will be the epitaph for their season.It was cheap, dirty and a reflection of an immature team that could not handle beating its rival for the first time in a long time. Garrett is responsible, but so is Kitchens, the front office and an organization that simply cannot tolerate such behavior.</p>
      <p>This isn’t a social media outburst by former safety Jermaine Whitehead, or former wide receiver Antonio Callaway being suspended for a second time this season. Those players are easy to cut. Garrett is a No. 1 overall pick and one of the faces of the franchise, and he just committed an act that is on the short list of the most heinous things ever done during a NFL game. It's indefensible.</p>
      <p>The reality also is the Browns are going to have to live with that ugliness the rest of the season. Maybe, just maybe, they'll learn from it. Mayfield, for his part, stepped up and said the right things afterward. The incident does hurt the team. It is inexcusable. It does take away from what could have been a season-altering victory for an organization that has been punched in the mouth since 1999.</p>
      <p>The Browns finally punched back on the field for 59 minutes, and then Garrett undid it all with oneswing of the helmet.It landed on Rudolph's head, but it's another self-inflicted knockout by Cleveland.</p>
      <p>The NFL can't take all the emotion out of its decision, but there is only one solution here, just one action it can take to make the problem go away.</p>
      <p>That’s making sure Garrett doesn't return until 2020.</p>
