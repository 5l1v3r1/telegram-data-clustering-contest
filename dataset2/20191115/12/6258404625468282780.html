      <h1>AMD Ryzen 7 2700X Hits All-Time Low Of $130 With This Smoking Hot Deal</h1>

      <p>We've tracking pricing of AMD's previous generation enthusiast flagship CPU for quite a while. The Ryzen 7 2700X has an MSRP of $319.99 when it launched over a year, but street prices <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/amd-ryzen-7-2700x-deals-microcenter">fell to $199.99</a> prior to the launch of the Ryzen 3000 family this Summer. </p>
      <p>Early last month, the <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/amd-ryzen-7-2700x-deal-50-percent-off">Ryzen 2700X hit a low $159.99</a>, and today another big discount is taking the processor down to the lowest price we've seen to date. Micro Center is currently <a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/505632/amd-ryzen-7-2700x-37ghz-8-core-am4-boxed-processor-with-wraith-prism-cooler">selling the chip for a low $129.99</a>. This price is for a retail boxed processor, and you can save an additional $30 off that price if you bundle it with an eligible motherboard.</p>

      <p>As with previous Ryzen deals from Micro Center, we should warn you that this deal is not available for shipping, and is instead only available for either in-store pickup, or by visiting the store and grabbing a Ryzen 7 2700X off the shelf. Micro Center has 25 locations in the United States spread out among 15 states (you can see the <a href="https://www.microcenter.com/site/stores/default.aspx">available store locations here</a>). </p>
      <p>When the <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/ryzen-7-2700x">Ryzen 7 2700X</a> first debuted last year, it was a force to be reckoned with thanks to its <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/zen">Zen+</a> 12nm <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/pinnacle-ridge">Pinnacle Ridge</a> microarchitecture. The 8-core/16-thread processor has a base clock of 3.7GHz, a boost clock of 4.3GHz and a TDP of 105 watts.</p>
      <p>The new flagship of AMD's enthusiast-class processor family is now the <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/zen-2">Zen 2</a>-based, 7nm <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/ryzen-9-3950x">Ryzen 9 3950X</a>. We reviewed this 16-core/32-thread monster yesterday (<a href="https://hothardware.com/reviews/amd-ryzen-9-3950x-zen-2-review">read Marco’s review here</a>) and it not only blows the Ryzen 7 2700X out of the water, but it also one of the most potent chips that you can purchase for less than $1,000 while maintaining the 105W TDP.</p>
