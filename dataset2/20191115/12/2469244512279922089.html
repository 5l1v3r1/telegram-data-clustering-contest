      <p>A new website and car charging points are helping a family-run dealership get set for the future.</p>
      <p>Devco MVS Ltd in Tiverton has launched a new website - <a href="https://www.devcorenault.com/">devcorenault.com</a> - as well as preparing for increased demand in electric cars.</p>
      <p>The garage based at Kennedy Way since 1982 was established in 1973 starting with a van and toolbox. It became a Renault dealership in the 1980s and is a Renault service point.</p>
      <p>Chris Drew, the general and service manager, said: “Our new website puts our presence out there.</p>
      <p>“We had a website, but we’ve upgraded it so we can show more of the services that we can offer to customers. It’s a lot more in-depth about the services we provide and about the technical side of repairs.</p>
      <p>“It’s interactive, and you can find out why you should have work done to your vehicle. It gives customers an insight into what goes on under the bonnet as well as the quality of vehicles and used cars we have.”</p>

      <p>As well as the website, the dealership has also embraced electric vehicles.</p>
      <p>“We have just done a lot of training on electric vehicles, and we are installing electric points soon for our workshop and exterior. We are getting ready for electric vehicles which are becoming more mainstream now.”</p>
      <p>The garage has also had a corporate upgrade by Renault which includes an upgraded reception and workshop. The business has also started offering a valet service from £15.</p>
      <p>“Come down and have a look or have a look at our website,” Mr Drew added. “There are lots of new stock now; we have a very high standard of our used cars under our Devco Select banner. That’s what we specialise in and have gained a good reputation in for many years. We always handpick used vehicles which we want to sell to ensure quality and expectations are kept at a high standard.</p>
      <p>“We hopefully will build on the good reputation that we have already got. Keep servicing local people and encouraging new customers to come along to see what we’re all about.”</p>
