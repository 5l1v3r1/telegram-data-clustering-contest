      <p>The <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201910041076959167-cyprus-slams-turkish-drill-ship-operating-near-island-as-flagrant-violation-of-its-sovreignity/">drilling ship Fatih has started operations off the north-eastern coast of Cyprus,</a> Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay told Anadolu news agency on Friday. In response, Cyprus stated that Ankara is showing contempt for international law, stressing that the action is completely illegal.</p>
      <p>The news comes after the EU Foreign Affairs Council adopted a framework for restrictive measures against Ankara earlier this week, slamming the Turkish authorities over the nation's drilling operations in the region.</p>
      <p>The Cypriot government <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201910121077035269-french-cypriot-naval-exercises-underway-amid-turkeys-drilling-efforts-in-region/">has already awarded exploration rights in the zone to Italian and French companies,</a> but Turkey continues to insist that it has the right to drill for natural resources in the Eastern Mediterranean, which includes the aforementioned area.</p>

      <p>The situation is aggravated by a decades-long territorial conflict, which started in 1974 when Turkish forces arrived on Cyprus claiming they had to protect local Turks from the Greek community amid a political crisis.  In 1983, the "breakaway" part of the island proclaimed the establishment of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, but it is only currently recognised by Ankara.</p>
