      <h1>Glen Kamara dismisses Rangers exit rumours as he breaks silence on Leeds link</h1>
      <h2>The midfielder has impressed for Rangers and has been heavily linked with a move down south.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T12:07:25+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 12:07</time> by <a rel="author">Mark McDougall, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mark-mcdougall/</a></address>
      <p>Rangers midfielder <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glen-kamara">Glen Kamara</a> insists he is ignoring rumours linking him with a move away from Ibrox.</p>
      <p>The Finland international only moved to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> last January but his form has earned him admiring glances from England.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/leeds-united-fc">Leeds United</a> are the latest team to be linked with a move while Brighton are also reportedly interested.</p>
      <p>A fee worth up to £10million is being suggested for Kamara - who cost Rangers just £50k when he moved from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dundee-fc">Dundee.</a></p>
      <p>But the 23-year-old isn't interested in listening to the speculation and told <a href="https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/kamara_tight-lipped_on_future_as_premier_league_clubs_circle/11069397">YLE</a> in his homeland: "You know what, I’m a Rangers player until told otherwise, I have no relevance to anything else so I’m focused on Rangers and Finland at the moment.</p>

      <p>"Going up to Scotland’s been good for me, for my career. You have everything there, nutrition, the coaches, you’ve got your team-mates, better players who make you better yourself, so it’s been great."</p>
      <p>Finland could qualify for Euro 2020 with a win over Liechenstein and Kamara admitted the nerves he used to get have disappeared.</p>
      <p>He added: "When I was younger yeah but not any more. I wouldn’t say I’m an old veteran but I kind of got used to it. I feel fine, I’m just excited for the game as usual. I feel like we can just go out there and do what we can do, and do our best, and hopefully we can go and get a result.</p>
      <p>"I’ve got a few childhood friends coming to see the game tomorrow who I haven’t seen in years upon years, so that’s going to be exciting.</p>
      <p>"Everyone’s been really good, supportive, messaging me and that."</p>
