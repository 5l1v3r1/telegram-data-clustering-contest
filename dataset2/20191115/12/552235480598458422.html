      <h2>Doug Allan has worked on shows including the smash-hit Blue Planet and will speak later this month.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T12:07:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 12:07</time> by <a rel="author">Fraser Clarke, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/fraser-clarke/</a></address>
      <p>One of the men behind TV hit series Blue Planet is set to give a talk in Helensburgh later this month.</p>
      <p>Doug Allan has been described by Sir David Attenborough as one of the world’s greatest natural history cameramen and he will explain how some of Attenborough’s best work is filmed to an audience at the Victoria Halls in Helensburgh on Thursday November 28 at 7.30pm.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>In a letter to the Royal Scottish Geographical Society, Attenborough explained what makes Doug so special.</p>
      <p>He said: "Doug is not like other men. He seems impervious to cold. He can hold his breath underwater longer than anyone I know. He delights in company – particularly if he can find someone who has not heard his jokes – yet he can tolerate, even welcome long periods of total solitude.</p>
      <p>“And he has that mixture of physical bravery, technical skill and zoological expertise that you need if you are to be one of the greatest of natural history cameramen. Which he is.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Entry is £10, free for students and RSGS members and tickets can be reserved on rsgs.org.</p>
