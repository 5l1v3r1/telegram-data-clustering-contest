      <p>Everyone is starting to gear up for Black Friday 2019 – including Microsoft. They've released their plans for a big Black Friday sale on their digital and physical catalogue, but in the meantime they have launched a crazy Xbox Game Pass offer for the holidays: Not only can new subscribers get three months of subscription to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for $1, but they will get bonus subscriptions to Discord, EA Access and Spotify as well. That's a heck of a lot for new subscribers, considering the sheer volume on the <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/xbox-game-pass/games">Xbox Game Pass games list</a>, the <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/xbox-game-pass-pc/games">Game Pass for PC games list</a> <i>and</i> stored in the <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/ea-access/games">EA Access Vault</a>.</p>
      <p>But there's even more good news – existing Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers can claim these three additional benefits straight from their Xbox dashboard for no additional cost. The offer is available for a limited time only, so make sure you get on it soon.</p>
      <p>If you log onto your Xbox this morning as an existing Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscriber, you'll likely see a "Your Gift" button right in the middle of your dashboard – if you can't see it there, you can find the offer in the Game Pass tab on the dash. From here, you get six months of Spotify Premium, one month of EA Access and three months of Discord Nitro tied directly to your Xbox account, all for a couple of clicks. <b>Note: if you have subscriptions to these additional services already, you likely won't be able to take advantage of this offer.</b> Thanks to the community for working this out!</p>
      <p>Xbox have always been generous with their door-busting subscription offers ahead of big sales, often offering Xbox Live Gold for $1 back in the day. The ridiculous increase in value only shows how much Xbox have grown to offer through subscription over the last year or so, through self-driven initiatives and key partnerships with third parties. We hope to see more of this in the coming generation.</p>
      <p>Xbox Game Pass is absolutely stuffed with great games if this is your first subscription – we recommend checking out our <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n39175/best-xbox-game-pass-games">best games in Xbox Game Pass list</a> if you're not sure where to start. These are the games ranked highest by our community. Just be wary if you go achievement hunting, though – Xbox Game Pass games often leave the service, though luckily we get some warning. We got some warning last night, in fact, when it was announced that <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n39724/games-leaving-xbox-game-pass-november">Strange Brigade, ABZU and more would be leaving Xbox Game Pass in November</a>.<br/><a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/ea-access/games">EA Access</a><a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/xbox-game-pass-pc/games">Xbox Game Pass PC</a><a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/xbox-game-pass/games">Xbox Game Pass</a><a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/news/tags/Sale">Sale</a><a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/xbox-one/news">Xbox One<br/></a><a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n39730/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-ea-access-discord-nitro-spotify-free#oMessages">View comments <br/></a><pic src="https://static.trueachievements.com/imagestore/0003476400/3476448.jpg" width="64" height="64"/><br/>Written by <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/author/Sam+Quirke">Sam Quirke<br/></a>Sam has been a Newshound since 2016 and is now the Editor for both TrueAchievements and TrueTrophies.
