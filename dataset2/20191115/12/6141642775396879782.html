      <p>Lloyds shareholders have lost a multimillion-pound High Court action over the acquisition of HBOS.</p>
      <p>A judge sitting in London on Friday dismissed an action by a group of 5,803 former Lloyds TSB shareholders who claimed they were “mugged” when the bank recommended the January 2009 deal without disclosing HBOS’s true financial state.</p>
      <p>Sir Alastair Norris announced his decision following a 2017 trial of the case brought by the shareholders against Lloyds Banking Group and former executives over alleged losses running into millions of pounds.</p>
      <p>Lloyds “robustly” contested the civil legal action, saying it did not consider there was “any merit” in the claims.</p>

      <p>During the hearing of the dispute, the judge heard from a lawyer for the shareholders that directors recommended the “disastrous” acquisition when, based on information they had, no reasonable director would have done so.</p>
      <p>But it was argued on behalf of Lloyds that the allegations of wrongdoing were “entirely devoid of merit”, and the unprecedented claim was “fundamentally flawed at every level”.</p>
      <p>A Lloyds Banking Group spokeswoman said: “The group welcomes the court’s decision.</p>
      <p>“Throughout this process, the group has sought to act in the interests of our shareholders as a whole.”</p>
      <p>Damon Parker, founder and partner of law firm Harcus Parker, which represents 300 institutions and almost 6,000 individuals in the case, said: “Our clients are deeply disappointed by today’s judgment.</p>
      <p>“They wish to assess their options and will be considering whether to appeal.”</p>
