      <h1>Borderlands 3 hotfix tackles a couple of progression blockers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T12:04:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 12:04</time> by <a rel="author">Sherif Saed</a></address>
      <p>There’s a new Borderlands 3 patch that aims to take care of a few player-reported issues.</p>
      <p><b>Borderlands 3</b>‘s latest hotfix is now available on all platforms. This update is entirely focused of addressing bugs that could block player progress, as well taking care of a few other miscellaneous issues.</p>
      <p>Hotfixes are live updates the game automatically downloads in the main menu, so be sure to sit on that screen for a bit the next time you launch Borderlands 3 to get the update.</p>
      <p>Outside of fixes, the hotfix also begins the winding down of the game’s <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/10/28/borderlands-3-how-to-farm-bloody-harvest-legendary-loot/">Bloody Harvest</a> event by reducing the frequency of Haunted enemies across the world. Check below for the full change log:</p>
