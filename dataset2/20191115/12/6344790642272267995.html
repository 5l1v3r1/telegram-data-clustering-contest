      <h1>Florence Pugh and Timothee Chalamet Talk Love Versus Economics in New Clip From LITTLE WOMEN</h1>

      <p>We have a new clip from the upcoming remake of <b>Louisa May Alcott</b>’s classic novel, <b><i>Little Women</i></b>. The clip features <b>Florence Pugh</b> as Amy March, and <b>Timothee Chalamet</b> as Laurie. The two are discussing the value of marriage, with Laurie saying it’s a matter of love and Amy seeing it as an economic choice, as women had no rights at the time to own money, land, or even her own children.</p>
      <p>I think the casting is so great this time around. I love each of the <i>Little Women</i> films that have come before this one, and I think this one looks great as well. For a lifelong fan of the novel, I don’t think I will ever tire of seeing this story told.</p>
      <p><b>Greta Gerwig</b> directed and wrote the adapted screenplay, and the film also stars <b>Saoirse Ronan</b>, <b>Emma Watson</b>, <b>Eliza Scanlen</b>, <b>Laura Dern</b>, <b>Tracy Letts</b>, <b>Bob Odenkirk</b>, <b>James Norton</b>, <b>Louis Garrel</b>, <b>Chris Cooper</b>, <b>Jayne Houdyshell</b>, and <b>Meryl Streep</b>.</p>
      <p>Check out the clip below, and see <i>Little Women</i> in theaters on Christmas Day.</p>
