      <p>Plymouth has a rich heritage when it comes to the military, which is clear to see all over the city.</p>
      <p>To help recognise that history and what people or businesses are doing to help those in and around the Armed Forces today, an awards night is to take place.Â </p>
      <p>Nominations for the Plymouth Armed Forces Awards 2020 have opened and will provide a much needed platform for showcasing the achievements of the local Armed Forces community, veterans, reservists and cadets.</p>
      <p>The inaugural event will be hosted at the Plymouth Guildhall on June 24, 2020 and will see nine categories open to nominations that celebrate what Plymouth and the Armed Forces community have achieved.</p>
      <p>Those categories are:</p>
      <p>-Forces Initiative Of The Year</p>
      <p>-Role Model Of the Year</p>
      <p>-Partner Of The Year</p>

      <p>-Employer Of The Year</p>
      <p>-Reservist Of The Year</p>
      <p>-Young Person Of The Year</p>
      <p>To be considered for an award, nominees must have a direct link to Plymouth or have contributed to the Armed Forces community or families based in the city.</p>
      <p>A team of judges will then decide the shortlists and winners of each category based on the information that has been provided in the nomination form.</p>
