        <i>Muff Busters exhibition begins in Camden in hope of tackling myths on ‘taboo’ body parts</i>
      </p>
      <p>In a bright indoor space in Camden’s Stables Market, a giant tampon is flanked by giant menstrual cups. Illustrations of female genitalia are dotted around the walls and some underwear is in a glass case.</p>
      <p>This is the <a href="https://www.vaginamuseum.co.uk/pages/exhibitions">world’s first vagina museum</a> dedicated to gynaecological anatomy, which opens this weekend in north-west London.</p>
      <p>The museum exists thanks to a public fundraising drive, with more than 1,000 people collectively donating almost £50,000. The director, Florence Schechter, says her motivation behind setting up the space was simple. “I discovered there was a penis museum in Iceland but no vagina equivalent anywhere else so I decided to make one,” she says.</p>
      <p>When asked more about her motivation, she adds with a smile: “I just love the vag. I am a bisexual woman.”</p>

      <p>The first exhibition, which will run until the end of February, is called Muff Busters: Vagina Myths and How To Fight Them. It looks at misconceptions that surround gynaecological anatomy, including cleanliness, appearance, periods, sex and contraception.</p>
      <p>“Just under 50% of the world’s population has one. Most of us came into the world through one. Yet vaginas and the rest of the gynaecological anatomy are still a taboo subject,” a poster in the exhibition reads.</p>
      <p>The show also quotes a <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/health/articles-reports/2019/03/08/half-brits-dont-know-where-vagina-and-its-not-just">YouGov survey</a> in March, which found that more than half of the British public surveyed could not describe the function or visibly identify the vagina (52%), the labia (47%) or the urethra (58%).</p>
      <p>Sarah Creed, who curated the exhibition, says these facts surprised her. “The facts for me were astounding … half of people surveyed did not know where the vagina was, I thought that was one thing people did know. Also for me, it was a statistic that one in five adult women think they have to remove a tampon to urinate – that blew my mind.”</p>

      <p>Creed explains the various elements of the show, stopping at one section, which focuses on the myth that pubic hair is unhygienic. Underneath this claim is the statement: “It’s actually more hygienic to have it.”</p>
      <p>Creed says: “Your vagina does not smell like a bouquet of flowers, nor should it. That is not a thing; none of your body organically smells like that. People liken the vagina to the armpit and say: ‘Oh, I have a smelly armpits. I’ll just put deodorant on it.’ No aerosols, please, around that part of the body.</p>
      <p>“Also people don’t realise we have a very delicate bacteria microflora ecology down there. You cannot have a product for all vaginas because everyone is different.”</p>
      <p>Creed goes on to talk about vaginal discharge, revealing that her own underwear appears in the exhibition. “The fact your vagina is acidic during reproductive years … that can lead to bleached underwear. This is my underwear in this box. That is how much I advocate for this,” she says.</p>
      <p>When this show is finished, Creed says, they want to focus on the history of menstruation and also current social and political issues.</p>

      <p>As well as the exhibition – which is also available to view online – events and performances will take place in the space, including comedy and a book club discussing feminist literature. The space also includes leaflets and information about vagina health and it has a shop selling everything from vulva postcards to vagina museum cups and guitar plectrums.</p>
      <p>Creed said: “We are an LGBTQ+ ally and an intersex ally … Intersex and trans individuals are not represented at all in this narrative. We are looking at how we can engage all people. I want cis heterosexual men to come here and feel it is a space for them to come and learn.</p>
      <p>“In this post-<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/25/harvey-weinstein-women-confront-producer-new-york-actors-hour">Weinstein</a> era, there’s more fear than there is inquiry because people do not want to be seen as inappropriate, but they are part of the conversation. People have wives or daughters and friends – people with gynaecological anatomy – and in order to interact with loved ones in an effective way, they should know more about them.”</p>
