      <p>"I had to do something that my fans couldn't believe until they saw it and heard it for themselves. People have loved the <i>Chixtape</i> series for so long and it's never been available on DSPs," says Lanez. "Not only did we go back and clear all the samples, but we got the original artists that we love so much to get back on these records with me."</p>
      <p>The Grammy-nominated musician continues, "I wanted to make something that people from different generations could appreciate and share together. Something that would make us celebrate our happy memories - music to enjoy life to."</p>
      <p><i>Chixtape 5 </i>is Tory Lanez's fourth official album. 2016's<i> I Told You</i>, 2018's <i>Memories Don't Die</i>, and 2018's <i>Love Me Now?</i> each peaked in the Top 5 on the Billboard 200 chart. He also has seven entries on the Hot 100 chart.</p>
