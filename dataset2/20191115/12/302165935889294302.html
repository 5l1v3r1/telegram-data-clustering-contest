      <p>COLOMBO, Nov 15 — At least 50 Sri Lankan election officials at the capital Colombo’s main counting centre were admitted to hospital today with food poisoning on the eve of presidential polls, officials said.</p>
      <p>Hospital spokeswoman Pushpa Soysa said the 50 men and women were being treated at the National Hospital after a meal at the centre, responsible for tallying hundreds of thousands of votes.</p>
      <p>“We have 50 officials at the moment,” Soysa said. “They are being treated for food poisoning.”</p>
      <p>Police said an investigation was under way just a day before Sri Lanka votes in what has become a closely fought presidential election.</p>
      <p>Officials said that reserve staff would be brought in if the 50 remain sick.</p>
      <p>Campaigning ended on Wednesday night, but police reported sporadic violence, including the stabbing of an author who had published a book on corruption under the former regime.</p>
      <p>Over 150,000 officials have been deployed to conduct the election at 12,600 polling booths and nearly 50 counting centres nationwide.</p>
      <p>Some 15.99 million people are eligible to elect a president from among 35 candidates. Only one of the candidates is a woman.</p>
      <p>The two frontrunners are housing minister Sajith Premadasa and the opposition’s Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who are said to be neck-and-neck.</p>
      <p>Officials said that the counting centre hit by the food poisoning was at the prestigious Royal College—Premadasa’s former school. — AFP</p>
