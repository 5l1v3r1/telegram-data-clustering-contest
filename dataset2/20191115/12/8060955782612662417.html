      <p>HALIFAX -- The fatality inquiry into the deaths of former Canadian soldier Lionel Desmond and his family will begin hearing evidence in Guysborough, N.S., on Monday.</p>
      <p>Desmond fatally shot his mother, wife and daughter before taking his own life in the family's rural home in Upper Big Tracadie, N.S., in January 2017.</p>
      <p>Nova Scotia's chief medical examiner, Dr. Matt Bowes, reviewed the circumstances of the deaths and recommended that an inquiry be held under the province's Fatality Investigations Act.</p>
      <p>The inquiry is to determine the circumstances of the deaths and is to look into some specific issues, including whether Desmond and his family had access to the appropriate mental health and domestic violence intervention services.</p>
      <p>This session of the inquiry is expected to sit for three weeks, followed by a recess.</p>
      <p>Additional sessions will be announced at a later date.</p>
      <p>At the conclusion of the proceedings, provincial court Judge Warren Zimmer will file a written report containing his findings and recommendations. It will not contain any findings of legal responsibility.</p>
