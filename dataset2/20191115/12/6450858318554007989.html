      <h2>Here’s everything you need to know about the seventh season of Brooklyn Nine-Nine, from the confirmed release date to plot details - and the confirmed season 8 too</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T12:54:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 12:54</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Painter</a></address>
      <p>Since experiencing a near-death experience (a.k.a. being dropped by Fox in 2018 and then picked up immediately by NBC), Brooklyn Nine-Nine has soldiered on and been renewed for another season. </p>
      <p>Created by Mike Schur (also lead writer on <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/news/entertainment/the-good-place-3684409/">The Good Place</a>) and Dan Goor, Brooklyn Nine-Nine follows arguably the funniest police force precinct in all of New York, both in their careers and personal lives. But when can we expect to see season 7 hitting our screens, and what's it all about? Here's everything we know so far. </p>
      <h3>When will Brooklyn Nine-Nine season 7 be released?</h3>
      <p>Whilst Brooklyn Nine-Nine historically kicked off every season in mid-to-late September, the move to NBC has changed that slot. It's currently slated for a "midseason" debut. If this follows the same timings as season 6, we should see the show be back <b>on NBC in January 2020</b>. </p>
      <p>E4 have not yet confirmed when they will be syndicating the show in the UK, but again looking back at season 6, we'll probably see this arrive in <b>March 2020</b>. Netflix UK will also most likely eventually have the series as well, but as they haven't yet added season six, we imagine we may not see it on there until 2021.</p>
      <p>Even though season 7 hasn't hit yet, NBC has already gone ahead and renewed the show for an eighth series, so fans can at least rest easy that the show isn't going to face cancellation again any time soon.</p>

      <h3>How many episodes will season 7 feature?</h3>
      <p>Season 7 has been ordered for a total of 13 episodes. Whilst this might seem quite short, don't fret. NBC originally only commissioned season six for 13 episodes, however the network later decided to extend the episode list by five, bringing the total number of episodes up to a grand total of 18 - so we may see the same thing occur. </p>
      <h3>Is there a trailer yet?</h3>
      <p>In a word...no. But we're keeping our eyes open, and the moment one drops you'll be the first to know.</p>
      <h3>Who is returning to Brooklyn Nine-Nine for season 7?</h3>
      <p>The good news is that the entire squad will be back for the beginning of series 7. That includes Andy Samberg (Jake Peralta), Stephanie Beatriz (Rosa Diaz), Terry Crews (Terry Jeffords), Melissa Fumero (Amy Santiago), Joe Lo Truglio (Charles Boyle), Andre Braugher (Raymond Holt), Dirk Blocker (Micheal Hitchcock) and Joel McKinnon Miller (Norm Scully).</p>
      <p>But the bad news is that after appearing in just a handful of episodes in season 6, Chelsea Peretti, aka Gina Linetti, will not be returning as a regular for season 7. We may see her appear in a guest role as we did last season, but no confirmations have been made as of yet.</p>
      <h3>What do we know about the season 7 plot so far?</h3>
      <p>It should come as no surprise that the events of season 7 are being kept under wraps until the series airs next year, but we have had some snippets of information over the past few months.</p>
      <p>Season 7 will pick up right after the cliffhanger of season 6. With the demotion of Holt, the whole team will be affected, which will give all the characters a different goal to work towards. Show-runner Dan Goor also revealed a few more nuggets of information at Comic Con, teasing the return of some familiar faces. </p>

We're hoping to have a Pimento episode, we're hoping to have a Pontiac Bandit episode obviously [and] hoping to have Marc Evan Jackson. And then we're also hoping to do a few episodes that break the form in the way we did last season because that's interesting for us and challenging."</p>
