      <h1>BioWare is allegedly going to give Anthem the 'Realm Reborn' re-launch treatment everyone wanted</h1>
      <h2>Good core, bad follow through</h2>

      <p>Well folks, it looks like it's happening.</p>
      <p>For years now the idea of "saving" your game and re-launching it in a better state has been called "The Realm Reborn treatment," named after <i>Final Fantasy XIV</i>'s initial disastrous 1.0 launch. Basically new management came in, took control, and completely re-tooled <i>FFXIV</i> into the amazing state it is today. <i>No Man's Sky</i> had a similar re-awakening. That <b>could</b> happen to <i>Anthem</i>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/sources-bioware-plans-a-complete-overhaul-for-anthem-1839892415">according to sources at Kotaku</a>.</p>
      <p>Although EA declined to comment on the matter, BioWare is apparently going to overhaul everything, including "its mission structure, its loot [and] its world." According to those sources BioWare is still working out the details, like whether or not it'll be an actual <i>Anthem </i>2.0 (this is their best bet, marketing-wise) or a series of sequential updates that make the game better: another name thrown out is "Anthem Next," and it's "unlikely" that 1.0 users will be charged full price if it's a new SKU entirely. As Kotaku points out, the game has not been abandoned completely either way, so if they actually follow through with this and deliver, props.</p>
      <p>As one of the few who saw promise with <i>Anthem</i>'s core gameplay, I said upfront that I was reticent as to whether or not BioWare would be able to actually give us a worthwhile living MMO-esque world. Everyone quickly figured out that you didn't need to be a seer to make that prediction, and the game has suffered ever since. Now, it might have a fighting chance, and salvage BioWare's reputation in the process. In the meantime, there's always <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../bioware-s-revealing-dragon-age-4-in-one-month-or-this-is-all-a-stupid-cruel-trick--571438.phtml">the next <i>Dragon Age</i> to dream about</a>.</p>
