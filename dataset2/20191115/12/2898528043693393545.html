      <p><a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/2221/michael-page">Michael Page</a> and <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/4745/chris-bungard">Chris Bungard</a> have been matched against new opponents for <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fight-card/1040/bellator-223-mousasi-vs-lovato">Bellator London</a> just eight days out from the event that will be held at the SSE Arena in London, England.</p>
      <p>Page’s new opponent, Giovanni Melillo, initially was revealed by the <a href="https://t.co/04DqfLVy8z?amp=1">Evening Standard</a> and was subsequently confirmed by Bellator via social media on Friday morning. Bungard’s new opponent, Benjamin Brander, was also revealed by the promotion via <a href="https://twitter.com/Bellator_Europe/status/1195312173788147712">social media</a> on Friday.</p>
      <p>Page (15-1-0) was initially slated to meet <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/2425/derek-anderson">Derek Anderson</a> in the main event of the Wembley card, but an injury to the American forced him out last week. “Venom” got back in the win column with a flashy first-round knockout of <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/4831/richard-kiely">Richard Kiely</a> in Dublin back in September following his first professional loss to <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/298/douglas-lima">Douglas Lima</a> in the semifinals of the Bellator <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/weight-class/welterweight">Welterweight</a> World Grand Prix.</p>
      <p>Italy’s Melillo (13-4-0) will make his Bellator debut at the event and is coming off of a victory after winning a decision over <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/2574/will-chope">Will Chope</a> in May. Melillo has fought under prominent banners in Europe including Cage Warriors, ACB, and Venator.</p>
      <p>Bungard (14-5-0) was initially pitted against former BAMMA title challenger Mario Saaed (13-4-0) in the English capital, but will now face another promotional newcomer in Brander (11-6-0).</p>
      <p>After stunning first-round submission win over former BAMMA double champion <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/4744/terry-brazier">Terry Brazier</a> to open up his tenure with Bellator, Bungard came up short in his second promotional outing when he dropped a decision to <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/4474/charlie-leary">Charlie Leary</a>.</p>
      <p>Brander also carries a loss into the contest having succumbed to a toe hold in the first round of his clash with <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/4693/luca-vitali">Luca Vitali</a> at SMMAC in April 2018.</p>
