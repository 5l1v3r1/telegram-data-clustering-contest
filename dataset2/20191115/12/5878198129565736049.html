      <h1>Meet the current young rising stars of Africa who are shaping the future</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T12:30:36+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 12:30</time> by <a rel="author">Theodora Aidoo</a></address>
      <p>Some notable Africans have made it to the <a href="https://time.com/collection/time-100-next-2019/">2019 TIME 100 NEXT list.</a> The list is a compilation of 100 young rising stars who are impacting the future of politics, business, science and more in the world.</p>
      <p>The list is an <a href="https://time.com/5725626/how-we-chose-time-100-next/">expansion</a> of the flagship TIME 100 that spotlights 100 change-makers in different fields from across the world.</p>
      <p>“When we first published our TIME 100 list of the world’s most influential people 15 years ago, it was dominated by individuals who rose through traditional power structures: heads of state, CEOs of public companies, actors from big-budget blockbusters, leaders of global foundations.</p>
      <p>“What has been striking about more recent editions is the growing number of individuals who did not need an establishment to command international attention—people like the Parkland, Fla., students who mobilized against gun violence (in 2018) and the climate activist Greta Thunberg (in 2019),” Edward Felsenthal, Editor-in-Chief and CEO of TIME said.</p>
      <p><b>Face2face Africa</b> compiled the list of some of the Africans who made it to the list.</p>
