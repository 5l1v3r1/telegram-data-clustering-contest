      <h1>(Video) Trent’s England performance shows he’s the best full back in the business</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T12:03:01+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 12:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/steven-carson/" target="_blank">Ste Carson</a></address>
      <p>Trent Alexander is the best right back in the world. Well, as far as Liverpool fans are concerned, his is, and his form over the last couple of years certainly suggest it!</p>
      <p>But the young lad’s performance on Thursday night as England humbled Montenegro suggests he is the deepest play-maker of the lot.</p>
      <p>He’s recently been described as both Kevin De Bruyne and Steven Gerrard (but at right-back), and his performance for the Three Lions is certainly in line with that!</p>
