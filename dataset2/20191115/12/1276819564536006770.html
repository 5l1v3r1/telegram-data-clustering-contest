      <p>Surfing is <a href="https://www.mnn.com/lifestyle/arts-culture/stories/5-books-about-surfing-ll-make-you-hang-ten">a thrill on its own</a>, but imagine looking down into the sea and witnessing a large whale swimming beneath you and your friends.</p>
      <p>That thrill was shared by a group of surfers at Dana Point, just south of Los Angeles. And, it was all captured on drone footage.</p>
      <p>Eighteen-year old Payton Landaas was flying his drone around the beach when he spotted <a href="https://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/animals/blogs/6-haunting-songs-sung-by-whales">the giant whale</a> moving towards the group of surfers.</p>
      <p>"It was completely surreal and so insane," <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/watch-giant-whale-swim-under-surfers-southern-california-n1082056">Landaas told NBC News</a>.</p>
      <p>The video shows how the surfers didn't seem to notice as the giant animal began to approach. Only one surfer quickly began swimming away when the whale flicked his tail.</p>
      <p>No doubt, this is one encounter the surfers and Landaas will never forget.</p>
