      <h3>The Las Piñas City regional trial court yesterday convicted four men for the 2013 killing of advertising executive Kristelle “Kae” Davantes</h3>
      <p>In a 13-page decision, Judge Salvador Timbang Jr. of Branch 253 sentenced Lloyd Benedict Enriquez, Samuel Decimo, Kelvin Jorek Evangelista and Jomar Pepito to reclusion perpetua for robbery with homicide.</p>
      <p>Likewise, they were ordered to pay the victim’s family P50,000 as indemnity, P50,000 in moral damages,  and P25,000 in temperate damages.</p>
      <p>“Based on what was proved by evidence their intent were to rob Kristelle. Their primary action was to take what they can,” the decision read in part.</p>
      <p>The court noted that the accused sold the victim’s personal property  confirming the intent to gain.</p>
      <p>Davantes was found dead—gagged with a handkerchief, tied using her car’s seatbelt and with five stab wounds on her neck—under a bridge in Silang, Cavite on Sept. 7, 2013.</p>
      <p>She was at the gate of their house at Moonwalk Village in Las Piñas City from a night out with friends when she was held at gunpoint by two of the accused.</p>
      <p>She was then taken, pinned down and placed at the back seat of her Toyota Altis.</p>
      <p>When police found Davantes’ body, her belongings and her car were already missing.</p>
