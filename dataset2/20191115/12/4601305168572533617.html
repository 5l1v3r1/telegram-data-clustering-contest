      <h1>Quevos are the best keto chips I've found</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T12:42:25+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 12:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/rob_beschizza" target="_blank">Rob Beschizza</a></address>
      <p>I've lost weight with keto—the only thing that's worked for me—but face two ongoing problems. First, I get bored of eating fat and leaves. Second, keto clones of normal snacks tend to be weird, mealy or downright unpleasant to taste. <a href="https://amzn.to/2Kn0mPq">Quevos</a> [Amazon link] are the first keto chips I can just sit and eat and eat and eat until I realize I've gone though three packets. My toddler steals them, too, so it's not just the carb-starved incentives of a keto dieter making me like them.</p>
      <p>They're made from egg whites, and come in two flavors: Sour Cream and Onion and Quevos Rancheros. There's 120 or 140 calories a bag and 2 or 3 net carbs (<a href="https://quevos.com/">full nutritional info is at the website</a>). There are other non-keto flavors (salt and pepper, sweet barbecue and cheddar) with 10 or 11 carbs a bag.</p>
      <p>They work, I think, because they're honest to what they are, which is baked egg chips, and aren't trying too hard to taste like potato chips. They flavors are unusual as well, suggesting a lot of experimentation. What is "Rancheros" flavor, exactly? The taste of tests.</p>
      <p>They're not perfect. The mouthfeel is dry and dusty, and you're getting a full load of sodium. The Quevos are small, probably because they're brittle and would arrive in fragments were they any larger. The latter point is a reviewer in search of a quibble, perhaps, so I'd like to stress that these are the first keto snacks I've tried that didn't taste like "keto snacks" and a must-try for people managing carbs.</p>
      <p>Quevos are <a href="https://amzn.to/2Kn0mPq">available from Amazon Prime</a> and at the <a href="https://quevos.com/">official website</a>. They're in stores (<a href="https://quevos.com/apps/store-locator/">locator</a>) too, but coverage isn't very wide.</p>
