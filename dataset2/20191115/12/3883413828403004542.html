      <p>A member of British special forces who killed two terrorists <a href="https://www.forces.net/news/security-forces-assist-militant-terror-siege-nairobi-hotel">during a hotel siege in Kenya</a> will be awarded one of the UK's highest honours.</p>
      <p>The unidentified SAS member shot and killed two of the four al-Shabaab gunmen in January this year, during a terrorist attack on a hotel in Nairobi, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Off-duty at the time, he was seen wearing combat gear over jeans and a shirt when he entered the complex alone.</p>

      <p>He was later photographed coming out of the hotel with terrified survivors, after bolstering efforts to evacuate 700 people.</p>
      <p>Twenty-one people, including a Briton named Luke Potter, were killed in the attack.</p>
      <p>It is thought the SAS soldier was in the country to train Kenyan special forces.</p>
      <p>The award is among those expected to be published at the end of this month in the Operational Honours list.</p>
