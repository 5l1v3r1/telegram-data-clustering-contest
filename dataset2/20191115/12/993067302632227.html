      <p>North Korea has called former US vice president Joe Biden a "rabid dog" that "must be beaten to death with a stick" in its latest swipe against foreign and political leaders it sees as hostile to its leadership.</p>
      <p>The commentary published by Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency said the US presidential hopeful "reeled off a string of rubbish against the dignity" of the North's supreme leadership and deserves "merciless punishment".</p>
      <p>The statement said: "Rabid dogs like Baiden [sic] can hurt lots of people if they are allowed to run about. They must be beaten to death with a stick, before it is too late. Doing so will be beneficial for the U.S. also."</p>

      <p>North Korea often unleashes crude insults against foreign leaders and politicians over what it sees as slanderous remarks towards its leadership.</p>
      <p>Mr Biden has repeatedly lamented President Donald Trump's embrace of authoritarian foreign leaders</p>
