      <h1>What Plymouth Argyle manager Ryan Lowe expects from Mark Cooper's table-topping Forest Green</h1>
      <h2>The Pilgrims will travel to Gloucestershire for their first-ever league meeting with Forest Green</h2>

      <p>Plymouth Argyle manager Ryan Lowe is not surprised that Mark Cooper’s Forest Green Rovers are sitting at the top of League Two.</p>
      <p>Cooper shares the same football principles as Lowe, who has spoken very highly about him as their respective sides prepare to face each other at The New Lawn on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Lowe said: “I’m looking forward to it. It’s going to be a good game of football - for once.”</p>
      <p>In a division where many teams get the ball from back to front as soon as possible, Lowe and Cooper take a very different approach.</p>
      <p>Cooper almost led Forest Green to promotion in only their second season as an EFL club last term.</p>
      <p>They finished fifth in the table before losing to Tranmere Rovers in the play-off semi-final.</p>
      <p>Lowe, who was a Sky Sports analyst for their coverage of both legs of the semi-final, believes there is much to like about Cooper and Rovers.</p>
      <p>They are currently one point clear at the top of the table with a record of nine wins, four draws and only three defeats.</p>
      <p>Lowe said: “Coops has done a fantastic job there. He has just missed out the last couple of years.</p>
      <p>“He’s a terrific bloke – one of the good guys. He plays the right way, hence he has been up there the last few seasons.</p>
      <p>“I have got nothing but the utmost respect for Coops. We have good conversations before and after games when we are down there (at Forest Green).</p>
      <p>“He has got a good set of players and it’s no coincidence they are top of the league, let’s have it right.</p>

      <p>“They have got some good players and they show consistent performance week in week out.</p>
      <p>“It’s a test for us going there. We are certainly going there full of confidence and to look for a win, but so are Mark Cooper’s team also.”</p>
      <p>Forest Green have lost only once at home in the league this season, when they were beaten 2-0 by Newport County on August 31.</p>
      <p>A lot of Rovers’ success has been based on an excellent defensive record.</p>
      <p>Lowe said: “They haven’t scored a lot of goals but they have only conceded 10, which is good in any league.</p>
      <p>“If you are only conceding that with 16 games gone, then it is terrific.</p>
      <p>“But we know what Coops is about, we know the way he sets up, we know his style of play. He’s very honest in his work.</p>
      <p>“So it’s no coincidence that they are up there and have only conceded 10 goals.”</p>
      <p>Lowe added: “We are going to the league leaders at the moment. Whether they are going to be there come the end of the season is to be seen.</p>
      <p>“But, for me, I think Coops has got it right this year. I’m sure they are certainly going to be in the top seven fighting for promotion again.</p>
      <p>“We are going there looking to get points on the board too.”</p>
      <p>After playing Forest Green, Argyle’s next league fixture will be against Bradford City, who are currently in second spot, at Home Park on Saturday, November 23.</p>

      <p>So these two matches will be a good indication of how the Pilgrims are shaping up under Lowe.</p>
      <p>He said: “We are eight points off number one, and I would have took that, but we have got two big games coming up.”</p>
      <p>Cooper, meanwhile, has also talked positively about Lowe in the build-up to Argyle’s visit.</p>
      <p>He said: “I am sure (Argyle) will finish at the top end of the league. If yoou are going to get promoted you have to finish above Plymouth.</p>
      <p>“When you are trying to drastically change the style of play, like what Ryan is trying to implement, it does take time.</p>
      <p>“They will get it right and have got good players. Ryan knows how to build a really entertaining team.”</p>
