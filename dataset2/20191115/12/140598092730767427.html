      <h1>WSL fans share their verdict on the season so far ahead of women's football weekend</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T12:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/telegraph-readers/" target="_blank">Telegraph Readers</a></address>
      <p>This weekend the FA's Women's Football Weekend takes place with four of the six fixtures in the Women's Super League this Sunday taking place at men's stadia. In what has been a record breaking year for the England Women’s game with a crowd of 77,768 at their game against Germany on November 9, it is set to be a landmark moment for women's football.</p>
      <p>The weekend will see the 2019 Women’s FA Cup Final teams Man City and West Ham meet again as well as a north London and Merseyside derby.</p>
      <p>Here, we brought together supporters of every club in this season's Super League to get their views on how they think their team has fared in the season so far, who their key player has been and what they expect from the rest of the season.</p>
      <p>We want to hear from other Women's Super League fans. Tell us your verdicts on the season so far, what you hope for the season ahead and your key player in the comments section below.</p>
      <h3>Marissa Thomas, Arsenal</h3>
      <p>The league is more competitive this season, and with the two newly promoted teams both performing well, no team can take their place for granted. Arsenal's progress in the Champions League could put them at a disadvantage in the league, and it will certainly test their squad depth. I think they'll finish second this season behind Chelsea.</p>
      <p><b>Key player:</b> Vivianne Miedema. She has great game intelligence, drive and determination and eye for goal.</p>
      <h3>Chris Pugh, Birmingham City</h3>
      <p>It's been a tough start to the league campaign for us, but we have been improving every game, culminating in the recent victory over Liverpool. Brighton had a great start to their campaign, but I believe we can head back up to The Midlands with a positive result on Sunday and give us the confidence to enjoy a comfortable mid-table finish.</p>
      <p><b>Key player: </b>Lucy Staniforth. Her attitude and performance this season has been really impressive.</p>
      <h3>Alan Wares, Brighton</h3>
      <p>There's been a clear step up in quality across the domestic game, and we've needed to raise our game. The team is competing, but needs to put chances away.The rest of the season is going to be very tough, but the improvements Hope Powell's have made ought to bear fruit soon.</p>
      <p><b>Key player: </b>Fliss Gibbons - and has been for three seasons. A whole-hearted, tenacious left-back who converted from being a forward.</p>
      <h3>Richard Paish, Bristol City</h3>
      <p>It's incredibly frustrating having just two points from our opening five games. I'm also concerned about facing Reading as we've lost our last five games against them. I feel we will very much be part of the relegation dogfight. In the bigger picture, it is good to see a few of our former managers and players at Everton having a good start to the season.</p>
      <p><b>Key player</b>: Returning fan favourite Jas Mathews has been superb in defence for us.</p>
      <h3>Chloe Leadbeater, Chelsea</h3>
      <p>This has to be one of the closest seasons we’ve had and it’s quite unpredictable which makes it quite exciting. Manchester United on Sunday won't be walkovers, it will be a closely-fought match, but I reckon we'll win. We're the ones to beat this season.</p>
      <p><b>Key player: </b>Beth England. She's returned after a loan move to Liverpool and has continued her amazing goalscoring run.</p>
      <h3>Ella Davies, Everton </h3>
      <p>It's great to see that the women’s game getting more exposure. I am ever the optimist it comes with being an Everton fan. I hope to see us challenge the top two and, as it stands, it's not impossible. The team is filled with young and ambitious player and have the potential to do well.</p>
      <p><b>Key player: </b>Chloe Kelly. She's our topscorer after returning well from ankle surgery earlier this year.</p>
      <h3>Heather Owens, Liverpool</h3>
      <p>I've enjoyed this season more than others as you can watch games you can't make it to on the FA player. I'm not sure how I feel about the Merseyside derby. A loss for us would be detrimental. It should be a fantastic match to watch. I sincerely hope Liverpool come out on top to earn our first win of the season.</p>
      <p><b>Key player: </b>Anke Preuss. She was an incredible addition to our team last season and continues to shine.</p>
      <h3>Emma Meredith-Shone, Manchester City</h3>
      <p>It’s already proving to be one of the most exciting seasons to date with teams throughout the league showing their competitiveness and quality. I expect West Ham to test us and be difficult to break down. To do well in this league, we have to be at our best. There's little room for error.</p>
      <p><b>Key player: </b>Ellie Roebuck. In absence of injured Karen Bardsley, she's contributed to City making a strong start and has shown what an unswerving, young talent she is.</p>
      <h3>Natalie Burrell, Manchester United</h3>
      <p>It’s been an incredibly competitive season with the addition of ourselves and Spurs in the WSL. You can’t call games anymore as high standards are being set by all of the teams. Chelsea are a fantastic side. I would take a draw on Sunday, but I think we can win. We have beaten City in the cup this season, so we can compete with the best.</p>
      <p><b>Key player: </b>Millie Turner. She's had a great start to the campaign with five wins and five clean sheets, and has been a rock at the back.</p>
      <h3>Sam Storey, Reading</h3>
      <p>It's been a decent start for us, winning the matches we'd expect, although two defeats to the Manchester clubs has meant gap to the big three has opened up.  Bristol City at home on Sunday is ultimately a game we need to win if we want to challenge for the top four. Solve our inconsistency issues and there's no reason we can't finish there.</p>
      <p><b>Key player:</b> Fara Williams. While the squad is strong as ever this season, even some of the players might admit she carries this team at times.</p>
      <h3>Sian Wallis, Tottenham</h3>
      <p>Spurs are performing well on and showing we have a squad with the quality to be competitive. Whatever the result against Arsenal, so long as the players play with heart as they have been, we’re going to enjoy ourselves. As for the rest of the season I’m pretty optimistic. Survival will be enough but a mid-table finish is attainable.</p>
      <p><b>Key player: </b>Anna Filbey. She's formed a strong partnership with Hannah Godfrey in the centre of defence.</p>
      <h3>Jo Bailey, West Ham</h3>
      <p>We had seven new signings at the beginning of the season, so it’s been exciting watching us blossom. It’s going to be a tough match this weekend, Man City are a quality side. We’ll throw everything at them as long as we keep pushing we’ll be in with a chance.</p>
      <p><b>Key player: </b>Martha Thomas.  She's an intelligent player and is improving with every match.</p>
