      <p>Wales take on Azerbaijan in the penultimate fixture of their Euro 2020 qualifying campaign this weekend.</p>

      <p>
        <b>What is the latest team news?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Left-back Neil Taylor and goalkeeper Danny Ward both miss out on the game due to personal reasons.</p>
      <p>Newport County's Tom King has been called up in place of Leicester City goalkeeper Ward.</p>
      <p>Tom Lawrence also misses out due to illness.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Joe Rodon, Jonny Williams, Ben Woodburn and David Brooks missed out on the squad due to injury.</p>
      <p>Aaron Ramsey and Gareth Bale are both available for selection.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What about suspensions?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Central midfielder Joe Allen is unavailable for the game in Baku.</p>
      <p>He picked up his third booking of the qualifying campaign in the 1-1 draw with Croatia last time out meaning he must serve a one-game ban.</p>
      <p>Daniel James and Gareth Bale are both one caution away from a suspension, meaning they will miss Tuesday's clash with Hungary at Cardiff City Stadium if they are shown a yellow card against Azerbaijan.</p>

        <b>What has Ryan Giggs said?</b>
      </p>
      <p>"It's an important game tomorrow night but of course we will probably need to win both games," said the Wales boss.</p>
      <p>"Tomorrow is a big game but also with a little eye on Tuesday aswell.</p>
      <p>"They're two big games. Obviously you're running out of games. We're just focused on tomorrow and winning the game. It's as simple as that.</p>
      <p>"The players are ready, they're looking forward to it. Azerbaijan had a good result at home last time against Croatia, so it's not easy, but the lads are ready for it."</p>
      <p>
        <b>What are the latest betting odds?</b>

      <p>Azerbaijan win 6/1</p>
      <p>Draw 16/5</p>
      <p>Wales win 1/2</p>

        <b>What do Wales need to qualify for Euro 2020?</b>
      </p>
      <p>If Wales beat Azerbaijan, they will qualify automatically if they win against Hungary and Slovakia drop points in either of their remaining games against Croatia and Azerbaijan.</p>
      <p>If Wales draw with Azerbaijan, they can still qualify automatically, but they'd need to beat Hungary (claiming a better head-to-head record against them in the process) and hope Slovakia claim no more than two points from their remaining games against Croatia and Azerbaijan.</p>
      <p>Wales can't qualify automatically if they lose to Azerbaijan.</p>
      <p>The Red Dragons will also miss out if Slovakia win their remaining two games.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Match facts</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Wales are unbeaten in seven meetings against Azerbaijan, winning six games and drawing once; they have faced no other side as many times without ever losing.</li>
        <li>This is the fourth time Azerbaijan will host Wales (P3 W0 D1 L2), losing 0-1 in the most recent such fixture in June 2009 due to a first half goal from David Edwards.</li>
        <li>Azerbaijan have won one of their last nine matches (W1 D2 L6), defeating Bahrain 3-2 in a friendly match in October. Their last competitive win came 364 days before this match against Faroe Islands in the UEFA Nations League (2-0).</li>
        <li>Wales have lost four of their 10 competitive games under Ryan Giggs (W4 D2 L4), three more losses than in their final 10 competitive matches under Chris Coleman (W4 D5 L1).</li>
        <li>Azerbaijan are currently winless in 11 European Championship qualifying matches, drawing four games and losing seven; their most recent such win was at home to Malta in March 2015 (2-0).</li>
        <li>Wales have earned eight points from their six European Championship qualifying matches during this campaign; during qualification for the 2016 edition of the competition, only two of the 25 sides to earn eight points or fewer after six matches eventually qualified for the main tournament (Russia and Turkey).</li>
        <li>Mahir Emreli and Ramil Seydaev have scored four of Azerbaijan’s five goals during this qualification stage, with Tamkin Xalilzade netting the other.</li>
        <li>Gareth Bale has scored seven goals and provided a further two assists in his 11 starts under Ryan Giggs – the Welshman scored in the reverse fixture back in September.</li>
