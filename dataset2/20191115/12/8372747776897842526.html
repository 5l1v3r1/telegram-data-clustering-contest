      <p>Browns defensive end Myles Garrett has been suspended indefinitely following a fight in the closing moments of the Browns' 21-7 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers Thursday night.</p>
      <p>During the fight, Garrett <a href="https://asnn.prod.ewscripps.psdops.com/news/national/brawl-near-end-of-nfl-game-browns-defender-rips-helmet-off-steelers-qb-strikes-him-in-the-head">ripped the helmet off Steelers' QB Mason Rudolph and swung it at Rudolph's head.</a></p>
