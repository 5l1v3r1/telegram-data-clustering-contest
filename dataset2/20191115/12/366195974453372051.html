      <p>Where does one go from delivering an album of the year contender? For <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/PushaClipse/profile">Pusha T</a>, the answer was to lay low and look to the future. Though we haven't heard much from King Push following <i><a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/daytona/profile">Daytona</a>, </i>the Clipse legend has made his presence felt throughout 2019. Today marks the arrival of yet another loosie, this one coming courtesy of DJ Shadow's <i>Our Pathetic Age </i>album. For whatever reason, the song was left off the main album, instead selected as a "bonus track." Yet that doesn't dull the blow by any stretch of the imagination, and Shadow remains in fine form as expected.</p>
      <p>Taking to a cinematic piano riff and a shuffling beat, he positions himself as "Push Tarantino," whipping up a smooth flow. "I been used to playing in the shadows," spits Push. "Every snake doesn't have a rattle, but every handgun has a barrel." If you ever wanted to hear Pusha T spitting pure bars over an X-Files flip, today may very well be your lucky day. Check this one out live, and show some love to DJ Shadow and King Push for this one.</p>

      </p>
      <p>But it's only one Push Tarantino<br/>The only gun in the room held by a gringo<br/>Cinco de Mayo, powder to the pyro<br/>Sing a lullaby to you stans like I'm Dido</p>
