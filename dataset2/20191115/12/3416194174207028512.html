      <p><a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/lili-reinhart/"><b>Lili Reinhart</b></a> stuns on the November 2019 digital cover of <a href="https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/lili-reinhart-glamour-uk-cover-interview-2019"><i>Glamour UK</i></a>.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old <i>Riverdale </i>star opens up about her struggles with depression, hitting the big screen and body insecurity. Check it:</p>
      <p><b>On depression</b>: “Depression has affected me in so many ways. It’s something that never goes away. I’ve experienced depression and anxiety. Not constantly, but I’m still experiencing it. I have spells of time where I feel completely unmotivated, I don’t want to do anything and I question myself. I don’t know how to handle stress very well. I find that talking about it and sharing my experience with other people, and reminding myself that I’m not alone has been incredibly therapeutic.”</p>
      <p><b>On how Jennifer Lopez has taught her about the power of hustling</b>: “Jennifer Lopez has said about herself, ‘I’m always the hardest worker in the room and I never stop,’ I admire that and that’s what I’ve been doing. At least this past year has been trying to take advantage of where I am in my life. I don’t have kids, I’m young, in my 20′s, I can take the time and energy to put into my career.”</p>
      <p><b>On how cellulite should not be seen as a body insecurity and that real skin is beautiful</b>: “It’s this weird thing where people think that it’s unnatural or a symbol of being fat. It’s so f***ed up because cellulite is just a part of the human body. It’s just genetic, it’s like having freckles on your face. It’s something that is there, you’re born with it, and it’s become this disgusting thing. We’re told: ‘We need to laser this away, no one wants to see that.’ There’s nothing more beautiful than when I see stretch marks, or cellulite, and people’s real skin.”</p>
