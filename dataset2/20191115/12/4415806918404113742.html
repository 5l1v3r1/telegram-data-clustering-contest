      <p>Calgary and Mumbai have respectively taken crown and wooden spoon in the <a href="https://www.mister-auto.co.uk/">Mister Auto</a> 2019 Driving Cities Index, a data-driven ranking of 100 world cities according to life on their roads.</p>
      <p>The index analysed 15 different metrics, including but not limited to… (*deep breath*) cars per capita, congestion score, road quality, average vehicle speed, average car age, air quality, fatality rates, incidents of road rage, and costs associated with parking, petrol, and tax.</p>
      <p>You could be forgiven for thinking that every city is overflowing with dreadful driving, but some are at least worse than others. Here are the best and worst cities to drive in for 2019…</p>
      <p>
        <b>The best:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>1. Calgary, Canada</b>
      </p>

      <p>It’s easy to resent Canadians – high quality of life, excellent healthcare, invariably pleasant personalities – and their chart-topping roads are just one more notch on the bedpost.</p>
      <p>Calgary is the latest city to rub it in our faces, with high air quality and blissfully little traffic. And they manage wide-reaching car ownership and a low fatality rate while covering ground at higher speeds than anyone else.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2. Dubai, United Arab Emirates</b>
      </p>

      <p>Driving in Dubai rests on one word: infrastructure. A city at the very pinnacle of modernity, Dubai boasts superior road quality, low congestion, and the newest cars of anywhere on the list. Perhaps best of all, for motorists if not the planet, the oil-rich nation ranks behind only Lagos for petrol prices, and a litre will set you back just under 50p.</p>
      <p>
        <b>3. Ottawa, Canada</b>
      </p>
      <figure>

      <p>Canada again! A real road all-rounder, Ottawa ranks in the top ten for air quality and vehicle speed, and racks up creditable scores in almost every category. Clean and surprisingly affordable, it racks up all the figures you would expect from the Canadian city.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The worst…</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>1. Mumbai, India</b>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.breakingnews.ie/remote/content.assets.pressassociation.io/2019/11/14204808/f7a88a29-ac1b-44d9-b3ab-b02267f55877.jpg?width=600&amp;s=bn-964436"/>

      <p>Rock bottom for congestion, the clogged up thoroughfares of Mumbai host the lowest speeds and oldest cars of any city analysed, and rank in the top five for road rage and fatalities. Financially, drivers face more of a mixed bag. Mumbai gas stations serve up some of the least affordable petrol anywhere, offset only partially by the world’s cheapest parking.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2. Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia</b>
      </p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>A surprise entry for those unfamiliar with Mongolian driving, Ulaanbataar clocks in at second thanks partly its chart-topping propensity for road rage, narrowly edging out the motorists of Moscow.</p>
      <p>Their anger is not without cause, as Ulaanbataar causes enough motoring mayhem to drive anyone up the wall. The Mongolian capital ranks in the bottom ten for congestion, air quality, road quality and fatality rate, alongside poor public transport and pricey parking.</p>
      <p>
        <b>3. Kolkata, India</b>
      </p>
      <figure>

      <p>We’re back in India for number three, and, when it comes to overcrowding, Kolkata’s reputation precedes it. Second only to Mumbai for road congestion, Kolkata manages to maintain the third highest fatality rate despite the third lowest average speed. All this, despite the second lowest rate of private car ownership on the list.</p>
