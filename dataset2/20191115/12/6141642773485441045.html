      <p>Astronauts have begun an extraordinarily complicated series of spacewalks to fix a cosmic ray detector at the International Space Station.</p>
      <p>Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano and US astronaut Andrew Morgan ventured out on Friday with dozens of tools and four new pumps for the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer.</p>
      <p>Nasa considers these spacewalks the most difficult since the Hubble Space Telescope repairs a few decades ago.</p>

      <p>Unlike Hubble, the spectrometer was never meant to undergo space surgery. After more than eight years in orbit, its cooling system is almost dead.</p>
      <p>The astronauts will go out at least four times this month and next to revitalise the instrument.</p>
      <p>Nasa has described the work as a heart bypass.</p>
      <p>The spectrometer is searching for elusive antimatter and dark matter. It has already studied 148 billion cosmic rays.</p>
