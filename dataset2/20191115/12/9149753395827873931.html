      <h1>Squad is free to play this weekend</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T12:09:42+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 12:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/ian-boudreau/" target="_blank">Ian Boudreau</a></address>
      <p>If you were curious about <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/squads-latest-update-introduces-commanders-uavs-and-artillery-strikes/">Squad's new update</a> that adds commanders, artillery, and air strikes, you're in luck: Squad is free to play on Steam this weekend. Developer Offworld Industries has opened the game up to support StackUp, a military charity that supports active duty military and veterans through gaming.</p>
      <p>StackUp is holding its 2019 "<a href="https://stackup.donordrive.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=cms.home">Call to Arms</a>" event this weekend, which will feature live streams of of veteran-oriented clans playing Squad, Post Scriptum, and Squad Ops. There's also time set aside for some SquadZ, which of course is Squad's zombie mod.</p>
      <p>If you're more into watching than playing, there's a streaming schedule for Saturday up at <a href="https://joinsquad.com/2019/11/13/stackup-call-to-arms-2019-on-november-16/">Squad's official site</a>, and you can donate to support the Offworld Industry team over at <a href="https://stackup.donordrive.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.team&amp;teamID=5100">StackUp's event page</a>.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, you can dive right into Squad for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/393380/Squad/">free all weekend</a>, from now through Monday, November 18. New players can buy the game for 50 percent off this weekend, too.</p>
