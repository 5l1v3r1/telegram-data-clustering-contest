      <h1>PIC OF THE DAY: When Someone Forces You To Say Congratulations</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T12:51:43+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 12:51</time> by <a rel="author">Timothy Ndoro</a></address>
      <p>It seems like the Rusape Town Council was so excited with the appointment of Zvinechimwe Vhuru as the Permanent Secretary in the newly created Ministry of National Housing that they rushed to place a congratulatory message in the daily publications.</p>
      <p>However, in their zeal to be the first to congratulate the new Permanent Secretary, the Rusape Town Council made several embarrassing blunders. To begin with, the image on the congratulatory message is not that of Zvinechimwe Vhuru but that of Marian Chombo, the former wife of former Finance Minister Ignatious Chombo.</p>
      <p>Then the message itself is grammatically incorrect as the sex of the subject changes three times in one sentence. Or perhaps this is not a sign of incompetence but rather that of someone who begrudgingly posted the congratulatory message against their will.</p>
      <p>Read the message below,</p>
