      <p>No, it is not 2005. This new version takes the approached similarly to that of Microsofts Surface laptop. The Razr has a full "main" screen, but flips into a smaller version of itself, including a smaller outside screen.</p>
      <p>According to the<a href="https://www.motorola.com/us/products/razr"> Motorola Razr website</a>, "the touch-enabled Quick View display allows you to see, respond, and move on. Play your music, take selfies, see notifications and more—all without ever opening your phone."</p>

      <p>Many of us have nostalgic feelings about slamming your flip phone shut after a call. The odd feeling of "giving it to them" when the dial tone rings in their ear. As much fun as that was, the newest version is pricier than the latest edition of the iPhone.</p>
      <p>So, whereas the idea of " two displays working together. Whatever you see on Quick View magically moves to the larger Flex View display the moment you flip open" sounds great, it comes with a hefty price tag.</p>
      <p>The Razr, which won't be available until 2020, retails at $1,500. Granted, it is not as much as the <a href="https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/galaxy-fold/">Samsung Galaxy Fold</a>, which has a retail cost of $1,980.</p>
      <p>Those who want the chance to get their hands on this engineering first, preorder begins Dec. 26. It will hit the market on Jan. 9 in the U.S.</p>
