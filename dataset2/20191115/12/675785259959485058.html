      <h2>Cristiano Ronaldo stormed past boss Maurizio Sarri and straight down the tunnel after he was withdrawn for a second game in a row</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T12:59:36+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 12:59</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Cristiano Ronaldo will hold showdown talks with Juventus boss after reacting angrily to being substituted during <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> ' win over AC Milan last weekend.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo was substituted in the 55th minute of last Sunday's Serie A match, the earliest he has ever been replaced during his 18 months at Juventus.</p>
      <p>He gave coach Maurizio Sarri a dirty look and walked straight down the tunnel.</p>
      <p><i>Gazzetta dello Sport</i> has claimed that the Portuguese superstar, who scored a hat-trick in his country's 6-0 drubbing of Lithuania on Thursday night, will meet with club chiefs when he returns from international duty.</p>

      <p>It is claimed that he will face questions from Juventus sporting director Fabio Paratici and vice-chairman Pavel Nedved over his attitude.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo, 34, was withdrawn early in the second half after a below-par performance against AC Milan last Sunday and replaced by Paulo Dybala.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese stormed past boss Maurizio Sarri and straight down the tunnel after he was withdrawn for a second game in a row.</p>
      <p>Substitute Dybala ultimately fired a second-half winner as Juventus returned to the top of Serie A after a 1-0 home win against AC Milan.</p>
      <p>Sarri said the player was hampered by a knee problem which he was trying to administer without missing matches.</p>

      <p>"He took a knock on the knee in training one month ago and it's affecting him," he said. "When he trains with high intensity and plays matches, he feels some pain. He can't train too hard and has difficulty when he kicks the ball."</p>
      <p>Sarri added that Ronaldo was also suffering collateral problems with his thigh and calf, raising the question as to whether the player is taking an unnecessary risk and should not just have a rest.</p>
      <p>Fabio Capello, a former manager and player at the Turin giants, recently claimed Ronaldo must accept that manager Sarri has other attacking threats at his disposal.</p>
      <p>"I didn't like this, it wasn't nice," Capello told  <a href="https://sport.sky.it/calcio/serie-a/2019/11/10/juventus-milan-sarri-intervista"><i>Sky Sport Italia</i>   </a>. "He must be a champion even when he comes off the pitch.</p>
      <p>"The truth is that  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/cristiano-ronaldo">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>  hasn't dribbled [past] an opponent for three years. I did the  <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-gb/primera-divisi%C3%B3n/34pl8szyvrbwcmfkuocjm3r6t">La Liga</a>  commentary when he usually took the double step and left you there.</p>

      <p>"Inside him is a super-champion, the best of all, but now there is Dybala and Douglas Costa, who made two sensational goals. Dybala in excellent condition can make the difference, as can Douglas Costa.</p>
      <p>"They win games without Ronaldo. Juve seemed dependent on him, instead the great squad and the quality of the players helps them win anyway.</p>
      <p>"Bravo Sarri, who had the courage to take him off, it takes personality, especially thinking that all the players in the squad can play and make a difference.</p>
      <p>"Cristiano did it for a while, but now it's not him and he must recover - especially on a physical level. He does not have the speed and dynamism he has shown at other times."</p>
