      <h2>Richard Dalton, MD at UK Remediation, ended giving the wonderful discovery to his 11-year-old son</h2>

      <p>This photo shows the remarkable fossil found at a soil treatment facility in Exeter.</p>
      <p>Richard Dalton, managing director at <a href="https://ukremediation.co.uk/">UK Remediation Ltd</a>, made the remarkable find at the Pinbrook Road Recycling Centre.</p>
      <p>The company specialises in checking soil for contamination and removing it from certain areas.</p>
      <p>Richard said they were used to finding interesting items - including rings, old coins and even toy cars.</p>
      <p>But he admitted this fossil in particular stood out - so much so that he gave it to his 11-year-old son, Eban.</p>
      <p>"Impressive fossil found at our Exeter Soil Treatment Facility <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/fossilfriday?src=hashtag_click">#fossilfriday</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/geology?src=hashtag_click">#geology</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/soil?src=hashtag_click">#soil</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/remediation?src=hashtag_click">#remediation</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/exeter?src=hashtag_click">#exeter</a>," read their tweet revealing the discvoery.</p>

      <p>"We have a treatment centre where we bring in contaminated soil and we get all sorts of interesting stuff - toy cars, money, rings â€“ those sorts of things old glass bottles etc," Richard explained.</p>
      <p>"We found a bomb once but someone then came in and said it was a shell and not live.</p>
      <p>"The fossil was great though. I ended up giving it to my son, Eban."</p>
      <p>UK Remediation are currently involved in the construction of the new bus station, where <a href="https://www.devonlive.com/news/devon-news/roman-fort-been-discovered-under-3362806">an old Roman fort</a> was recently discovered.</p>
      <p>They are also working at sites by St Davids Station and Exeter City's St James' Park stadium, although Richard said that they are yet to make any weird or wonderful discoveries at those sites as yet.</p>
