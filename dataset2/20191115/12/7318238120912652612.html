      <p>Two French adventurers flew through the world's highest natural cave on Thursday, powered by jet-propelled wings.</p>
      <p>Vincent Philippe Reffet and Frederic Yves Fugen leapt from a helicopter and sped towards the Tianmen cave, near Zhangjiajie, in central China's Hunan province, at speeds of up to 385kph.</p>
      <p>Using their jet propulsion to adjust their speed and directiojn, the duo passed though the 131.5-metre by 57-metre mountainside arch, which is also known as Heaven's Gate.</p>
      <p>The naturally-formed cave lies towards the top of the Tianmen mountain and is about 1.5 kilometres above sea level. The area is accessible by cable-car.</p>
      <p>The daredevil pair also showcased their remarkable courage with heart-stopping stunts in the sky above the mountain.</p>
