      <h2>Netflix will make amendments to crime documentary series The Devil Next Door following accusations of "rewriting history" from Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T12:07:24+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 12:07</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Knight, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/lewis-knight/</a></address>
      <p>Netflix documentary series The Devil Next Door will undergo changes following complaints from the Polish Prime Minister.</p>
      <p>The documentary series follows the life of Ukrainian man Koh Demjanjuk who moved to Cleveland and led a 'normal' life before being accused of being the notorious Nazi concentration camp guard dubbed Ivan the Terrible.</p>
      <p>Following the release of the series, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki wrote an open letter to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/netflix">Netflix</a> to slam historical inaccuracies in the show.</p>
      <p>He criticised the use of historically inaccurate maps that showed Nazi concentration camps in what is now modern-day Poland.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/polands-prime-minister-files-complaint-netflixs-devil-next-door-1253844">The Hollywood Reporter</a> , Morawiecki wrote: "There is no comment or any explanation whatsoever that these sites (on the map) were German-operated.</p>
      <p>"As my country did not even exist at that time as an independent state, and millions of Poles were murdered at these sites, this element of The Devil Next Door is nothing short of rewriting history."</p>

      <p>Now, the streaming service has confirmed to THR that they will be making changes to the series in response.</p>
      <p>Netflix told The Hollywood Reporter: "We are hugely proud of  <i>The Devil Next Door</i>  and stand by its filmmakers, their research and their work.</p>
      <p>"In order to provide more information to our members about the important issues raised in this documentary and to avoid any misunderstanding, in the coming days we will be adding text to some of the maps featured in the series.</p>
      <p>They added: "This will make it clearer that the extermination and concentration camps in Poland were built and operated by the German Nazi regime who invaded the country and occupied it from 1939-1945."</p>
      <p>The series has already caused <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/netflix-fans-haunted-riveting-true-20822947">an emotional responses from Netflix viewers.</a></p>
