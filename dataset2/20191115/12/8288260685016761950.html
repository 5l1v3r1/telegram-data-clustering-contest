      <p>Coronation Street's Jane Hazlegrove has revealed her heartbreaking battle with 'Imposter Syndrome'.</p>

      <p>Jane, , who plays Bernie Winter on the ITV soap, spoke on Lorraine today (Friday, November 15).</p>
      <p>She told host Lorraine Kelly: “It is quite difficult when I pop up. I tend to throw things at the television. I am quite hard on myself. I think that’s important though don’t you?</p>
      <p>“Imposter syndrome - that at any moment I could say, are you Jane Hazelgrove? Yea, get out.”</p>

      <p>Lorraine replied: “I hear you. Someone will tap you on the shoulder and say, actually we’ve found you out and you have to go away now.”</p>
      <p>Jane said: “The arrogance of youth - I wasn’t nervous at all then.</p>
      <p>"Now I’m a woman in my 50s, it was really frightening, because it’s Coronation Street, it’s a big gig and I don’t want to let the show down and I don’t want to let myself down or the family or anything.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Speaking of her return to the long-running ITV1 soap: “I was petrified, but Dolly [Rose Campbell] and Sam [Aston] who play Gemma and Chesney, they pushed me around, guided me to the green room and worked out when I needed a cup of tea.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Praising actor Peter Ash for his portrayal of Paul, Jane said: “I hope it gives lots of people a vocabulary and the courage to go, hang on, this is what I have been carrying around with me for a long time and it’s not right.”</p>
