        <i>She’s manipulative, flouts my house rules and has my daughter at her beck and call. Should I tell my daughter how I feel and risk damaging our relationship?</i>
      </p>
      <p>My 19-year-old daughter recently started her first serious relationship. She and her girlfriend are very intense and are together as much as possible. Initially, I liked her, but I’ve since seen another side to her. She’s manipulative, flouts my house rules, claims to have health issues and has my daughter running around after her. My daughter is very protective of her, blind to her behaviour and argues with me if I raise the broken house rules. I don’t want her girlfriend in my house but I’m worried that if I tell my daughter how I feel, and how dysfunctional her relationship is, I’ll alienate her.</p>
