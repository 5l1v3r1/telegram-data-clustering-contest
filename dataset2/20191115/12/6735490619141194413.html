      <p>“You are too,” Aniston told her co-star. “You forget it because you blacked out… of fear.”</p>
      <p>Witherspoon, however, remembered things differently.</p>
      <p>“I’ve never done it again,” Witherspoon declared, adding a surprising revelation. “Did you know they asked me back and I said I can’t do it,” she said of being approached by producers to reprise her role as the little sister of Aniston’s Rachel.</p>

      <p>The reason: “I was too scared!”</p>
      <p>“You got scared?” Aniston replied in disbelief.</p>
      <p>“They asked me to come back, and I was like, ‘I’m too nervous,'” Witherspoon admitted.</p>
