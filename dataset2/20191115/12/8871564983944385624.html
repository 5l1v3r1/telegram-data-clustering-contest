      <p>Well, the other shoe has finally dropped.</p>
      <p>After months of waiting with bated breath to see whether the city’s most hotly anticipated annual musical event would go ahead amid increasingly unruly protests, Hongkongers got their answer today: despite holding out as long as possible, Clockenflap will be Clocken-flopping off of this year’s events calendar, organizers announced today.</p>
      <p>“Due to the escalation of the crisis this week, and therefore the uncertainty this creates for the coming weeks, Clockenflap 2019 will be cancelled,” backer Magnetic Asia said in a statement.</p>

      <p>“Until this week we were fully committed to delivering the festival. Unfortunately, the situation has now made this impossible.”</p>
      <p>The statement went on to promise refunds to ticket buyers, and to thank them for their support.</p>
      <p>“While it pains every one of us at Magnetic Asia to cancel Clockenflap 2019, we still believe in bringing people together in positive ways, and will continue to unite people through the power of music and arts,” the statement concludes.</p>
      <p>This year’s show would have been the 12th outing for the festival, which rose from humble beginnings to attract superstar headliners and thousands of fans. (In fact, you can <a href="https://coconuts.co/hongkong/features/clockenflap-a-history/">read all about it’s history here</a>.)</p>
      <p>Halsey, Mumford &amp; Sons, and Lil Pump were set to headline this year’s ‘Flap, which was slated to take place next weekend.</p>
