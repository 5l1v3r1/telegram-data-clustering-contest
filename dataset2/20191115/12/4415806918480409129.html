      <h1>'A national problem': Rural practice sees no applications for GP vacancy</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T12:27:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 12:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/denise-odonoghue/" target="_blank">By Denise O’Donoghue</a></address>
      <p>A GP practice in West Cork has received no applications for two advertised vacancies.</p>
      <p>Thirty years ago, the practice received 70 applications for one of the jobs on offer, a stark contrast to the results of their most recent appeal.</p>
      <p>The practice is based in Bandon, a 40 minute drive from Cork city, but has struggled to attract applications for two recent vacancies.</p>
      <p>Fianna Fáil TD Margaret Murphy O'Mahony raised the issue in the Dáil and the HSE will readvertise the position.</p>
      <p>"I brought the situation up in the Dáil - not only did I bring it up but I chased Minister Harris physically and over the phone," she told C103's Cork Today Show.</p>
      <p>"Luckily there is a temporary solution. This is what he sent me: 'Efforts are underway to fill both the current and upcoming vacancy with both posts currently being readvertised. In the meantime, Cork-Kerry Community Healthcare is funding a full-time locum GP in the current vacant post so that eligible medical card holders continue to receive the care to which they are entitled'."</p>

      <p>She suggested the GP contract should be renegotiated to encourage more doctors to apply for GP positions.</p>
      <p>"I think a lot of it is to do with the GP contract. The GP contract was formed in 1989 - 30 years ago. A new contract needs to be negotiated in order to provide a better service and to make the job more appealing for particularly younger GPs. A lot of these GPs are going abroad, they have better opportunities. I think there needs to be more incentives to keep them in Ireland."</p>
      <p>Deputy Murphy O'Mahony said it is also difficult to attract younger GPs to rural areas outside major cities and this also impacts services such as South Doc.</p>
      <p>"This particular practice has a state-of-the-art computer system, you could be in New York. They're really keeping up with the times. Bandon is so near Cork Airport, so near Cork City. It's like a domino effect - if you can't recruit, if you can't retain, obviously it's going to have a knock-on effect on South Doc, which, again, is in disarray."</p>
      <p>She described the issue as "a national problem", adding: "Nearly every constituency is facing this."</p>
