      <p>Ukrainian film director Oleh Sentsov has in person received a Sergei Magnitsky Human Rights Award, an international prize given in the field of investigative journalism and human rights protection.</p>
      <p>Sentsov was due to receive the award last October, but he was in jail in Russia, serving his term on charges of allegedly preparing terrorist attacks in Russia-occupied Crimea, according to the <a href="https://www.golos-ameriki.ru/a/sentsow-awarded-magnitsky/5167127.html">Voice of America's Russian service</a>.</p>
      <p>The award was presented in London by Meghan McCain, the daughter of 2008 presidential candidate and U.S. Senator John McCain. Her father was also posthumously given the award in 2018.</p>
      <p>The Sergei Magnitsky Human Rights Award has been granted since 2015 for merits in the field of investigative journalism.</p>
