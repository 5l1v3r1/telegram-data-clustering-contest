      <p>Percy Pig, the delicious, unofficial mascot of Marks &amp; Spencer, is now available to eat in muffin form.</p>
      <p>The baked goods were spotted in store and posted to Instagram by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4h8ZZmJwj4/?utm_source=ig_embed">kevssnackreviews</a>, and sport a Percy Pig gummy adhered to the top of a delightfully pink muffin with a big splodge of even pinker buttercream.</p>

      <p>The muffins are one sale for a pound a pop and are filled with raspberry jam. They've rolled out alongside other new festive treats, like the Snowflake Chocolate Caramel Muffin, M &amp; S Mince Pie, and Rodney Reindeer Gingerbread - all of which are also a quid with the exception of Rodney, who comes in at just 85p.</p>
      <p>So if you're on your lunchbreak and want a whimsical and tasty morsel to get you through your afternoon, pop into M&amp;S and grab yourself a muffin. [<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/ms-launches-pink-1-percy-pig-muffins-11076853/">Metro</a>]</p>
