      <p>I don’t know quite what I was expecting when Snow Patrol announced they would be bringing their ‘reworked’ tour to Devon, but I left Plymouth Pavilions feeling they had taken me through an emotional rollercoaster musical journey by the time they were done.</p>
      <p>To celebrate their 25th anniversary, Snow Patrol have reworked tracks from their back catalogue and added three new ones to perform not just their hits but voted for fan's favourites in a fresh, new way.</p>
      <p>Usually I’m not a fan of seated gigs, but for a show like this to work – and it was a show because it even had an interval – the audience had to sit and listen.</p>
      <p>Charmingly likeable frontman Gary Lightbody interacted easily with the crowd between songs giving short stories about the songs and apologising for his ‘bad’ intros. In fact, it just made you like the band even more.</p>

      <p>During the evening, the band worked their way through an incredible set list of nearly 25 songs spanning their hugely successful career.</p>
      <p>Many were stripped back to their bare bones, either acoustically or with the help of a stageful of musicians who added extra depth and rawness to the music and lyrics.</p>
      <p>Some weren’t instantly recognisable due to intro changes and how much they were slowed down, but again it just worked brilliantly to hear them in a new way, and it made you hang on to every word sang so beautifully by Gary.</p>
      <p>I preferred the second half which was more lively and stepped up a notch. A personal surprising highlight of the evening was Run which has been so overplayed, largely due to Leona Lewis, that I’m bored of hearing it. But the reworked version took it to a whole new powerful, almost gospel level at the start, which was simply mesmerising.</p>
      <p>Other favourites were Heal Me, Chocolate, and Don’t Give In. For the encore the band came back on stage and played What If This Is All the Love You Ever Get? which hearing it performed live for the first time brought a tear to my eye.</p>
      <p>The final song was Just Say Yes, providing the perfect ending to an unforgettable evening.</p>
      <p>Rather than feeling like this was a band just going over their old hits, it’s clear to see Snow Patrol still have so many great songs yet to be released and written so I’ll definitely be booking my ticket for their next anniversary tour in years to come.</p>
