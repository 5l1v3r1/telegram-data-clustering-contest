      <h1>Here’s a new trailer for free-to-play Xbox One shooter CrossFire X</h1>

      <p>You might not have heard of CrossFire before it was <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/06/09/crossfire-x-heading-westward-xbox-one/">announced at this year’s E3</a>, but it’s actually a pretty big deal. Now there’s a new trailer showing in-engine footage.</p>
      <p>If you don’t know about CrossFire, it’s essentially a Counter Strike style multiplayer first-person shooter that saw its first iteration release back in 2007. It’s immensely popular in Asia, particularly in Shina and South Korea. There’s even a film adaptation in the works. CrossFire X is a new Xbox version of the game, and it’ll be the first version to make a real push in the West, despite the original PC game making its way to the US for the first time a decade ago. Anyway, here’s the new trailer, which made its debut at X019:</p>

      <p>While your first thought might be – oh, joy, a Counter Strike knock-off with free-to-play monetization, you might not want to sleep on CrossFire X – it’s one of the biggest games in the world, just not in the regions you typically think of when we, on an English language website, think of the hottest video games.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, the Xbox One version of the game is set to add a single-player campaign for the first time – and <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/06/10/remedy-making-crossfire-xs-story-campaign/">that campaign is being developed by Remedy Entertainment</a>, of Control and Alan Wake fame.</p>
      <p>CrossFire X doesn’t have a final release date yet, but we know it’ll make its free-to-play debut on Xbox Live at some point in 2020.</p>
