      <p>Nvidia has just revealed its latest financial results, which exceeded the expectations of analysts, with the company noting that the success was driven by its high-end gaming graphics cards as well as data center sales.</p>
      <p>In total, Nvidia managed to rake in $3.01 billion (around £2.3 billion, AU$4.4 billion) in Q3 (the quarter running up to the end of October), close to 4% better than the revenue expected by analysts.</p>

      <p>CEO of Nvidia, Jensen Huang, made a statement to say: “Our gaming business and demand from hyperscale customers powered Q3’s results. The realism of computer graphics is taking a giant leap forward with Nvidia RTX.”</p>
      <p>As VentureBeat reports, Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights &amp; Strategy, observed: “It appears the company is getting improved traction in both RTX and new Super GTX discrete GPU cards.”</p>
      <p>Certainly at the premium end of the market, it’s not surprising that Nvidia would be capitalizing on the current vacuum of competition from AMD, which hasn’t launched its <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-navi-23-could-be-an-nvidia-killer-graphics-card-that-launches-in-2020">high-end Navi GPU</a> yet (it’s expected mid-2020). And RTX dominating here no doubt means a lot of profit…</p>
      <p>It could also mean that Nvidia feels its strategy of launching expensive RTX graphics cards is paying off, which means it's unlikely we'll see budget RTX GPUs any time soon.</p>
      <p>As to the new GTX Super cards apparently performing well, at least according to Moorhead, we assume that’s mistyped and should refer to RTX Super offerings – given that the new <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/the-nvidia-geforce-gtx-1660-super-and-1650-super-are-the-new-1080p-champions">GTX Super spins weren’t out in time</a> to make an impact for Q3 (and that Huang singled out RTX in his comment, too).</p>
      <p>The GTX 1660 Super wasn’t on sale until October 29, and the Q3 results go up to October 27 (with the 1650 Super not due until November 22).</p>
      <h4>GTX superstar</h4>
      <p>That said, it’s likely the new wallet-friendly GTX Super offerings will make themselves felt in the next quarter’s results, given that we billed the 1660 variant as a “superstar in the entry-level graphics card market” in our <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-gtx-1660-super">review</a>.</p>
      <p>Nvidia noted that its highlights were announcing GTX Super cards – and note that’s announcing, not selling – as well as the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/minecraft-gets-free-ray-tracing-support">announcement of bringing ray tracing to Minecraft</a>, the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/the-history-of-minecraft">best selling PC game ever</a>.</p>
      <p>As for the data center, Huang commented: “This quarter, we have laid the foundation for where AI will ultimately make the greatest impact. We extended our reach beyond the cloud, to the edge, where GPU-accelerated 5G, AI and IoT will revolutionize the world’s largest industries. We see strong data center growth ahead, driven by the rise of conversational AI and inference.”</p>
      <p>Moorhead further observed: “In the future, I am most interested in seeing how the company takes advantage of newer edge data center and cloud opportunities with its EGX and Jetson AI platforms as it has a unique offering with a mature AI software platform.”</p>
      <p>The analyst also noted on Twitter that Nvidia’s CEO said the company shipped more Tesla T4s (Turing) than Tesla V100s (Volta) in Q3.</p>
