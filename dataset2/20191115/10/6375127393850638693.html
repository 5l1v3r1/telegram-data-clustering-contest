      <h3>THE future  husband of Pop Princess Sarah Geronimo, singer-actor-triathlete and entrepreneur Matteo Guidicelli took to Instagram and Facebook  his heartfelt  message to his family, his fiancée and to Sarah’s parents nito lamang nakaraang Huwebes, November 14.   And it reads:</h3>
      <p>“Family is my number one priority.  In this next chapter of my life, I’m extremely excited to start my own family with the love of my life, my fiancée Sarah G.</p>
      <p>"I deeply thank my parents for teaching me the values of a solid family.  Life will never be perfect but what matters is that we learn, grow and improve until it it our time to take over.</p>
      <p>"My father has been my best example; he is my mentor, my solid rock.  Papa and mama’s values, passion and selfless attitude has taught my siblings and me a lot and has molded us to become what we are today.  One day, I pray, I will do the same for my own family.</p>
      <p>"I’m very blessed and honored that my parents welcomed Sarah to our humble family like another daughter.  My sister and little brother love her the same way.  Knowing she is loved and accepted in the family simply fills up my heart with joy.</p>
      <p>"People might be thinking that our relationship has been smooth sailing.  But let me tell you, it hasn’t been easy.</p>
      <p>"Sarah has been tough.  I saw her grow, mature, and develop into an independent beautiful woman that I am extremely proud of!</p>
      <p>"My love, thank you.</p>
      <p>"I dream that one day both our families will sit around a dinner table and simply celebrate life.</p>
      <p>"Love, happiness, joy and LIFE must always be celebrated.</p>
      <p>“Tito Delfin and Tita Divine, if there have been hard feelings or events that were not supposed to happen in the past, I humbly apologize.  I assure you that I will give Sarah a happy life with the best of my capabilities.  With pure, honest love and respect.</p>
      <p>"We wish to move forward with our life plans and begin this brand new chapter of our life.</p>
      <p>"Mahal na mahal ko po si Sarah.  Mahal ko din po kayong magulang niya at mga kapatid niya.  Hangad ko po na maging isang pamilya tayo.</p>
      <p>"Pangako ko po na aalagaan ko si Sarah na kapareho ng pangangapalaga nyo sa kanya.”</p>
      <p>Nito lamang nakaraang linggo ipinaalam ni Matteo ang kanilang engagement ni Sarah pero ang younger brother ni Matteo na si Paolo ang nagbuking na nung isang taon pa umano engaged ang dalawa.</p>
      <p>Naging overwhelming ang suporta kina Sarah at Matteo hindi lamang ng kanilang mga kaibigan in and out of showbiz kundi maging ng kanilang mga fans na may kinalaman sa kanilang engagement.</p>
      <p>Malamang na sa isang taon na sila magpakasal.</p>
