      <h1>Germany makes measles vaccination compulsory for children</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T10:48:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 10:48</time> by <a rel="author">Amy Woodyatt, CNN</a></address>
      <p>Germany's parliament has voted to make <a href="https://cnn.com/2019/04/24/health/measles-outbreak-record-us-bn/index.html">measles</a> vaccinations compulsory for children, with parents who fail to immunize their children facing fines of €2,500 (US$2,750).</p>
      <p>The Measles Protection Act, which the Bundestag <a href="https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/impfpflicht.html">approved</a> on Thursday, requires all parents to provide evidence that their child has received two measles vaccinations before they are enrolled in school or kindergarten.</p>
      <p>Medical staff, daycare workers, teachers and workers at community facilities must also be vaccinated under the act, which is due to come into effect in March 2020, a spokesman for the Ministry of Health told CNN.</p>
      <p>There has been a resurgence of measles -- a highly infectious viral illness that can spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes -- across the globe.</p>
      <p>Symptoms of the illness -- which can also be spread through touching contaminated surfaces -- may include fever, cough, runny nose, watery eyes and a rash of red spots.</p>
      <p>Germany had registered 501 measles cases between January and mid-October 2019, according to the Ministry of Health.</p>
      <p>Under the new law, parents will have to present a certificate to the educational institution proving their child has received both vaccinations. Parents who do not inoculate their children will face a fine of €2,500.</p>
      <p>Daycare centers that admit unvaccinated children will also be charged, and children who are not vaccinated can be excluded from school, according to the ministry.</p>
      <p>Measles has seen a wide <a href="https://cnn.com/2019/04/15/opinions/measles-cases-rise-global-crisis-fore-ghebreyesus/index.html">resurgence around the world</a> -- in both high-income countries in the Americas and Europe and lower-income nations in Asia and Africa -- fueled in part by <a href="https://cnn.com/2019/03/04/health/mmr-vaccine-autism-study/index.html">fear of</a> and lack of access to vaccines, and complacency.</p>
      <p>Almost 350,000 measles cases were reported globally in 2018, according to the United Nations children's agency UNICEF -- more than doubling from 2017.</p>
      <p>Two doses of the vaccine are needed to protect against measles. According to the World Health Organization, roughly 95% of a population needs to be vaccinated with two doses of the measles vaccine to ensure herd immunity.</p>
      <p>According to the German Ministry of Health, although 97.1% of first-graders had received the first vaccination, rates are not as high for the second jab, meaning the country still hasn't reached the 95% quota.</p>
