      <p><b>FINDLAY, OhioÂ (AP)</b> - Ogden Newspapers will purchase The Courier of Findlay and the Review Times of Fostoria in Ohio from the Findlay Publishing Co.</p>
      <p>The Courier reports the two companies announced the purchase Wednesday. Findlay Publishing says it will continue to operate three radio stations in Findlay and four in Columbus, Indiana.</p>
      <p>The president and CEO of Findlay Publishing, Karl Heminger, says he believes Wheeling, West Virginia-based Ogden Newspapers is the right choice to steward the two publications going forward.</p>
      <p>Ogden Newspapers CEO Robert Nutting commended the Heminger family for its more than 130-years of stewardship of The Courier, and 19-year ownership of the Review Times. He says his family looks forward to continuing their legacy of community-based journalism in Findlay and Fostoria.</p>
      <p>The sale is expected to close this month.</p>
