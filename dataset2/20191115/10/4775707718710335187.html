      <p>Today is the day that we can all start hunting down those <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Star-Wars-Jedi-Fallen-Order/achievements">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order achievements</a>, but how is the game faring in the press? Taking on a Star Wars game is a big responsibility, especially for a studio like Respawn under the yoke of EA, who in turn have had mixed success with the brand in the past.</p>
      <p>Luckily as the reviews start to trickle in, it seems that Respawn have mostly pulled it off, delivering a solid experience for fans. More than one review has referenced 2018 PlayStation exclusive God of War as a touch point for comparisons. Interestingly, the critical community seems to be completely split on whether the game is bold or predictable.</p>
      <p>You can check out the latest reviews below as they come in.</p>
      <h4>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order Reviews Round-Up</h4>
      <p><b>Current Metacritic Score:</b> 84 from 29 critics<br/><b>Current Metacritic User Score:</b> 7.8 from 91 ratings<br/><b>Current OpenCritic Score:</b> 86 from 34 critics – 91% of reviewers recommend<br/><b>Current TrueAchievements Community Score:</b> 4.9 from 5 votes</p>
      <p><b>IGN – 90:</b> "A strong cast sells a dark story while keeping things fun and loyal to Star Wars lore, and fast, challenging combat mixes with energetic platforming, decent puzzles, and diverse locations to explore for an all-around amazing game." <a href="https://uk.ign.com/articles/2019/11/15/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review">Full review</a></p>
      <p><b>Guardian – 4/5:</b> "Lightsaber combat is heavily influenced by the 2018 hit God of War, which broke new ground for making each axe fight feel weighty and dangerous, and Dark Souls, where every enemy is defeated in a different way." <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/nov/15/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review">Full review</a></p>
      <p><b>Gamespot – 8:</b> "By increasing difficulty, ratcheting back Force powers, and developing compelling characters, Jedi: Fallen Order delivers a worthy expansion to the Star Wars galaxy." <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review-the-friends-we-/1900-6417364/">Full review</a></p>
      <p><b>GamesRadar – 4/5:</b> "Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is at its best when it's a cross between fighting and being on a Star Wars safari, as you explore dense planets that are teeming with hidden areas, lore, and other secrets for you to unearth." <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review/">Full review</a></p>
      <p><b>USGamer – 3.5/5:</b> "... it comes so darn close to being truly amazing that it's actually a little heartbreaking. In all the places that 2018's God of War managed to stick the landing, Jedi: Fallen Order winds up stumbling just enough to be distracting." <a href="https://www.usgamer.net/articles/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review">Full review</a></p>
      <p><b>TheSixthAxis – 8:</b> "The real selling point is Fallen Order’s planetary exploration. Each world you visit is its own cleverly crafted russian doll with layers being peeled away as you unlock new traversal techniques and Jedi abilities – it’s no surprise that Metroidvania comparisons have been bandied about." <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/11/15/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review-ps4-xbox-pc/">Full review</a></p>
      <p><b>GameInformer – 8.75:</b> "The inspirations taken from Dark Souls, Uncharted, and Metroid Prime unite to create something unique that just happens to work incredibly well for this beloved license." <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review-a-turbulent-thrill-ride">Full review</a></p>
      <p><b>Eurogamer – No score:</b> "When I reached the end of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, I didn't feel like I'd had a rewarding experience. I was relieved it was over. With some side-meandering, it took around 30 hours, and I didn't enjoy a lot of them." <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-14-star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review-solid-combat-mired-in-shallow-storytelling-and-technical-problems">Full review</a></p>
      <p><b>Polygon – No score:</b> "Jedi: Fallen Order is enjoyable, with caveats about its performance and some aspects of its design attached, but it goes places I didn’t expect, and it gets there by a route I would never have considered. That’s a bold choice for a game this inherently commercial." <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/11/15/20965341/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc">Full review</a></p>
      <p><b>The Verge – No score:</b> "For the most part, Fallen Order fuses these ideas culled from other games into a well-made whole. I wouldn’t call any aspect of the game amazing in its own right, but each element is good enough, and more importantly it all fits together in a way that’s both cohesive and makes sense for a Star Wars game." <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/15/20965741/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review-xbox-ps4-pc-respawn">Full review</a></p>
