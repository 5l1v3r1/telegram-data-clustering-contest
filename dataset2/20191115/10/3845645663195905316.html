      <p>Police in London on Friday said they were investigating an assault after a Hong Kong minister fell to the ground as she was jostled by demonstrators.</p>
      <p>Justice secretary Teresa Cheng had been due to give a lecture at the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators (CIArb) in Bloomsbury Square, central London, on Thursday evening.</p>

      <p>But the CIArb said the event was cancelled because “whilst entering the building (Cheng) was assaulted by a crowd”. It added: “As a result she sustained an injury to her arm.”</p>
      <p>Video of the incident circulating on social media shows Cheng being surrounded by jeering pro-democracy protesters, who followed her through the streets near the CIArb headquarters.</p>
      <p>She fell to the ground and was then escorted away.</p>
      <p>China called the incident an “appalling attack” and urged London to provide better security.</p>
      <p>The CIArb said it was “committed to peacefully resolving conflict and deplores the use of violence, particularly to a guest to the United Kingdom”.</p>

      <p>The Metropolitan Police said in a statement a probe was “ongoing to establish the full circumstances” of the incident, adding no arrests had been so made far.</p>
      <p>“A woman was taken to hospital by London Ambulance Service suffering an injury to her arm,” it added without confirming Cheng’s identity.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong has seen relentless protests since June as many in the city of 7.5 million people have vented fury at eroding freedoms under Chinese rule.</p>
      <p>Cheng is in London on a visit to promote its role as a dispute resolution and deal-making hub.</p>
      <p>She is one of the most unpopular government officials in Hong Kong, seen as playing a key role in pushing forward the now-shelved extradition bill to China, which sparked the months of unrest there.</p>
