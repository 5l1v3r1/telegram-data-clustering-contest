      <p>Director Chandraprakash Dwivedi said, "We auditioned a lot of young, fresh faces for the role because we were looking for a stunningly gorgeous Indian heroine. While Sanyogita was an incredibly beautiful person, she was also a strong, confident girl. We were looking to find someone who could match the magnetic persona of Sanyogita and we found that in Manushi. We auditioned her a couple of times because we wanted to be sure about the casting. She nailed the audition each time. She has been rehearsing six days a week since then and is being thoroughly groomed for the last nine months by YRF.”<br/><br/>Prithviraj is being made by Yash Raj Films. Incidentally, Chandraprakash Dwivedi had directed the television drama Chanakya. Prithviraj will release on Diwali 2020.</p>
