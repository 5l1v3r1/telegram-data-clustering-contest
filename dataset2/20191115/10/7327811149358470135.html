        <figcaption>Police are looking for a driver who fled the scene after a father and his young son were struck, causing them to fall through a gate.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>It happened on Wednesday, November 6th on 128 W. 112th Street.</p>
      <p>The white BMW came quickly - and with no warning, seemingly making a beeline for the man and the young boy.</p>
      <p>The car then backed up, and two men emerged. One man walked toward the victim, where police say he stabbed the father. Both suspects got back in the car as a good Samaritan picked up the 8-year-old and carried him to safety.</p>
      <p>Police say the victim survived and also left the scene, abandoning his son.</p>
      <p>The boy is safe, and did not suffer any serious injuries.</p>
      <p>Police assume this was a targeted hit - possibly gang-related. They are searching for three people - the victim and the men who tried to kill him, and almost killed his son.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information is asked to call NYPD's Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477) or for Spanish, 1-888-57-PISTA</p>
