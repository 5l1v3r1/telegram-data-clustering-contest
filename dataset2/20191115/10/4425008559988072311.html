      <h2>First details of Parliament hack emerge.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T10:28:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 10:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.itnews.com.au/author/justin-hendry-1167397" target="_blank">Justin Hendry</a></address>
      <p>Cyber security experts took more than a week to eject the state-sponsored attacker from Parliament’s computing network after it was compromised by malware earlier this year, Senate President Scott Ryan has revealed.</p>
      <p>In answers to questions on notice to budget estimates hearings released on Thursday, Ryan said the malware infection occurred when a small number of the network’s 4000 users visited an unnamed website that itself had been compromised.</p>
      <p>“A small number of users visited a website that was outside of parliamentary management and that website had been compromised causing malware to be injected into the parliamentary computing network,” he said.</p>
      <p>Ryan said the <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/security-breach-strikes-parliaments-it-network-519035">cyber attack</a>, which has since been labelled <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/parliament-hack-report-too-torrid-for-public-release-532757">“Australia’s first national cyber crisis”</a> by the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD), took a total of nine days before the infiltration was stamped out after it was first discovered on 31 January.</p>
      <p>This was more than a full week before the Department of Parliamentary Services (DPS) reset all network, users, administrator and system level passwords in a bid to protect parliamentarians and their staff, as well as staff from the department.</p>
      <p>“DPS became aware of the incident on the 31 January 2019. DPS and the ASD acted immediately to monitor and plan effective remediation,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Removal of the attacker occurred on the 8 February.”</p>
      <p>While ASD had previously <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/asd-confirms-data-stolen-in-parliament-it-breach-523595">confirmed a limited amount of data deemed non-sensitive was stolen</a> by the attacker, new details on the type of data taken has now been disclosed.</p>
      <p>“The small amount of non-sensitive data refers to DPS corporate data and data related to a small number of parliamentarians,” Ryan said.</p>
      <p>He said that any impact on the email accounts of parliamentarians either had or would be discussed with those parliamentarians directly.</p>
      <p>“Two Senators were contacted. I will not address matters related to members of the House of Representatives; they should be addressed to the Speaker,” Ryan said.</p>
      <p>The new information is likely to be the some of the only details released about the attack, with the federal government <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/parliament-hack-report-too-torrid-for-public-release-532757">unlikely to release even a redacted version of the final report</a>.</p>
      <p>This is at odds with other organisations like the Australian National University, which was <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/anu-attacker-built-shadow-ecosystem-to-stay-hidden-for-six-weeks-531803">praised for its transparency over its recent cyber attack</a>.</p>
      <p>A state-sponsored actor is still widely believed to have been responsible for the attack, which was also later found to have <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/political-party-networks-caught-up-in-parliaments-it-breach-519467">extended to the networks of the Liberal, Labor and National Parties</a>, though the federal government is yet to make any attribution claims.</p>
      <p>Reuters reported in September that multiple sources had claimed <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/asd-confirms-data-stolen-in-parliament-it-breach-523595">ASD had concluded the attack was conducted by China</a>.</p>
      <p>Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick, who submitted the questions, said the sparse details were no substitute for a declassified version of the report, and that without it, MPs, Senators and the Australian public would remain in the dark.</p>
      <p>"The release of further information on the hacking of the Australian Parliament is welcome, but it’s no substitute for the release of a declassified version of ASD/DPS cyber security team’s report on the security incident that was first discovered some nine months ago," he said.<br/> <br/>"The Government should ... be upfront about identifying who was trying to hack Australian democracy. It is an open secret anyway."</p>
      <p>Ryan also confirmed on Thursday that there was no evidence of “insider involvement or assistance in the compromise”.</p>
