      <p><u>DIPLOMACY</u><br/><br/><b>Kenya and Somalia have agreed to "normalise" relations and start reissuing travel visas to each other's citizens after a long-running dispute over marine borders strained ties between the neighbours.</b><br/><br/>The agreement, announced by Kenya's presidency late Thursday, followed a meeting in Nairobi between President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Somali counterpart, Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed.<br/><br/>The East African leaders "reaffirmed the invaluable relations that exist between Kenya and Somalia and agreed to explore avenues of strengthening bilateral and diplomatic ties" between them, a statement from Kenyatta's office said.<br/><br/>Kenyatta and Mohamed, better known by his nickname Farmajo, were seen smiling and shaking hands in photographs posted by the Kenyan presidency on Twitter.<br/><br/>The statement made no mention of a territorial dispute between Somalia and Kenya over a stretch of the Indian Ocean claimed by both nations believed to hold valuable deposits of oil and gas.<br/><br/>Relations between Mogadishu and Nairobi deteriorated earlier this year after Somalia decided to auction off oil and gas blocks in a disputed maritime area.<br/><br/>Nairobi recalled its ambassador from Mogadishu in February in the row over which of the East African neighbours controls access to the lucrative deposits -- a dispute they've taken to the International Court of Justice.<br/><br/>The contested triangle of water, which stretches over an area of more than 100,000 square kilometres (40,000 square miles), lies in a part of Africa only recently found to be sitting on significant energy reserves.<br/><br/>Somalia also accused Kenya earlier this year of detaining and confiscating the passports of Somali ministers trying to enter the country.<br/><br/>Mogadishu formally complained about Kenya restricting entry visas to MPs and cabinet ministers allegedly forced to return to Somalia despite holding diplomatic passports.<br/><br/>Somalia had also raised concerns that Kenya has reinstated a mandatory stop at Wajir, near the border between the two countries, for a security check on all flights from Somalia, a practice discontinued in 2016.</p>
