      <p>HUNTINGTON STATION, Suffolk County (WABC) -- A suspected stalker on Long Island is under arrest, accused of repeatedly following a teenage girl.</p>
      <p>George Letellier, 56, of Huntington Station, is accused of coming in contact with the 14-year-old at least four times in the last four weeks.</p>
      <p>She says he would follow her in his gray Jeep Wrangler and have inappropriate conversations with her.</p>
      <p>Investigators say he once prevented the girl from getting away from him, and was in her personal space.</p>
      <p>Police were able to eventually track the suspect down after the victim got his license plate number.</p>
      <p>He will be moved to Central Islip from the second precinct to face a judge later Friday.</p>
