      <h1>Jorginho, Mateo Kovacic shine; Ross Barkley struggles - Chelsea's winners and losers so far</h1>
      <h2>Midfield pair have excelled with N'Golo Kante out injured, while Spain forward is one of several players pushed to the fringes</h2>

      <h3>Winners</h3>
      <p>
        <b>The academy</b>
      </p>
      <p>An obvious choice. It's not just the success of Fikayo Tomori, Mason Mount and Tammy Abraham. It is also the recent introduction of Reece James at right back. It is also the continued development of Callum Hudson-Odoi. And it is also the occasional sightings of Billy Gilmour and Marc Guehi.</p>
      <p>Frank Lampard has insisted throughout that the young players will only play if their performances are up to scratch and the head coach has not been let down. They have all impressed - from Tomori's assuredness and flourishing partnership with Kurt Zouma to Mount's ceaseless work-rate and endeavour, via Abraham becoming one of the Premier League's best goalscorers.</p>
      <p>Above all it is a testament to the coaching staff in the academy who have invested so much time and effort in producing players of this quality. Lampard has also made regular references to the work carried out by Neil Bath and his team - they deserve all the praise.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Jorginho and Mateo Kovacic</b>
      </p>
      <p>It is a testament to both that Chelsea have played so well with N'Golo Kante, their best player, sidelined by injury. Most of that comes down to the flourishing partnership between the Italian and Croatian, neither of whom were particularly loved by supporters last season.</p>
      <p>Now it is the norm for supporters to chant their names with Jorginho's passing range and Kovacic's drive dovetailing very well. It seemed like Kante's injury issues were going to be a huge blow and they have missed the Frenchman nowhere near as much as initially feared.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Chelsea supporters</b>
      </p>
      <p>For years fans had been demanding that the club's academy players get a fair chance in the first team. The moment many had thought would never happen has arrived - and it tastes even sweeter than imagined.</p>
      <p>There is a feeling of positivity seldom seen among supporters anywhere in England, ditto a sense of patience and an acceptance that there are likely to be blips. Some are even arguing that watching the class of 2019-20 is more fun than when Chelsea were winning 1-0 every week on the way to league titles.</p>
      <h3>Losers</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Pedro</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Spaniard has hardly featured since the early weeks of the season - struggling to make the bench in recent times and failing to even make the travelling party for last month's Champions League trip to Ajax.</p>
      <p>He is one of the most experienced outfield players in the squad and Lampard spoke early in the campaign about how he was helping the youngsters on the training pitch. But Pedro is out of contract in the summer and it looks like the 32-year-old will exit quietly with barely a fringe role in his final campaign at the Bridge.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Ross Barkley</b>
      </p>
      <p>So far his season will be remembered for either missing the late penalty against Valencia when appearing to take duties from Jorginho and Willian or spilling chips in the back of a taxi in Liverpool less than 48 hours before the Champions League trip to Lille.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The England midfielder is at risk of becoming a fringe member of the squad. His performances have been average at best, others have proven a better fit and even Mason Mount looks to have overtaken him in Gareth Southgate's plans too.</p>
      <p>There has also been some time spent out through injury but Barkley needs to do more when given his next opportunity. Otherwise he might be left frustrated on the periphery.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Olivier Giroud</b>
      </p>
      <p>Everyone was made aware of the France striker's frustrations when he spoke about his need for minutes earlier in the season, warning that if he was not playing he would need a move away because of his desire to be part of the national team's squad at the European Championship.</p>
      <p>As it stands Giroud is third-choice striker, behind Michy Batshuayi in the back-up stakes as Abraham's development shows no signs of slowing down. The 33-year-old has been finding the net for France regularly - including against Moldova on Thursday evening - but Didier Deschamps, who has also clashed with Lampard over Kante's fitness, has said he must be playing club football.</p>
      <p>Something needs to change soon or Giroud could be asking to leave in January.</p>
