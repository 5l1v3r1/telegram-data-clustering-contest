      <p>The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/supreme-court">Supreme Court </a>on Friday summoned chief secretaries of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi to know about steps taken by them to reduce air pollution in Delhi-NCR.</p>
      <p>A bench of justices Arun Mishra and Deepak Gupta said effective steps must be taken and 13 pollution hotspots in Delhi should be cleared of pollutants.</p>
      <p>The apex court questioned the Delhi government over granting exemptions, including to 2-and-3 wheelers, during its odd-even scheme and said that pollution level in Delhi is increasing in spite of the vehicle rotation scheme being in force.</p>
      <p>It also expressed concern that despite reduction in stubble burning, pollution levels in Delhi are worse.</p>
      <p>The Delhi government told the top court that its odd-even scheme has helped in reducing pollution and the "real culprit" behind the region's pollution is stubble burning.</p>
      <p>The Centre also told the bench that it is examining feasibility of putting up smog towers to reduce pollution in Delhi.</p>
