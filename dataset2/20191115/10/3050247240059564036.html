      <h1>Bitcoin Price Back ‘On the Edge’ Says Trader After $8.8K Rejection</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T10:21:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 10:21</time> by <a rel="author">William Suberg</a></address>
      <p>Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) staged a dramatic breakout of its weekly trading corridor on Nov. 15, but selling pressure rejected an attempt to break $9,000. </p>

      <h3>Bitcoin fails to break resistance at $9K</h3>
      <p>Data from Coin360 shows BTC/USD suddenly moving upwards on Friday, hitting $8,800 in minutes from previous levels closer to $8,550. </p>
      <p>The bullish momentum failed to last, however, with Bitcoin returning to lower levels below $8,600 just thirty minutes later. </p>
      <p>At press time, BTC/USD was trading at around $8,580, having come full circle in under an hour. </p>

      <p>As Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-steady-above-92k-as-volatility-collapse-predicts-big-move">reported</a>, Bitcoin has become increasingly known for temporary moves up and down, with commentators citing various factors influencing the volatility. </p>
      <p>In the long term, however, models suggest the largest cryptocurrency should <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-tests-8-500-support-as-trader-warns-of-further-new-lows">fluctuate</a> around an average price of $8,300 until the block size halving next May. </p>
      <p>The rejection at $8,800 meanwhile lifted hopes of a return to overall bullish sentiment, as sketched out by regular Cointelegraph contributor <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/authors/michael-van-de-poppe">Michaël van de Poppe</a>.</p>
      <p>“On the edge here. Preferably I'd want to see a tick up to like $8,800 to confirm a slight trend reversal (like scenario),” he said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1195020464156028929">Twitter update</a> on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Continuing, van de Poppe added downward pressure could take Bitcoin the other side of its pre-halving average: </p>
      <blockquote>“If not, this slow bleed could accelerate to $8,200 as the next level. Sentiment; fear. Obviously.”</blockquote>
      <h3>Altcoins diverge once more</h3>
      <p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/altcoin">Altcoins</a> markets saw a return to mixed trading after many major cryptocurrencies lost ground on Thursday. </p>
      <p>Ether (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price-index">ETH</a>), the largest altcoin by market cap, delivered mostly sideways performance, moving less than 1% versus previous levels. </p>
