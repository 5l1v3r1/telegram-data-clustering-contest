      <h2>Markus Duesmann replaces Audi Chief Executive Bram Schot</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T10:15:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 10:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.autoblog.com/bloggers/reuters/" target="_blank">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>FRANKFURT â€” <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/volkswagen/">Volkswagen</a> on Friday said former <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/bmw/">BMW</a> executive Markus Duesmann, an expert in procurement and engine development, will take over as Volkswagen Group's board member responsible for research and development and as head of <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/audi/">Audi</a>.</p>
      <p>Duesmann, who will take up the position on April 1, 2020, replaces Audi Chief Executive Bram Schot, who will leave at the end of March 2020.</p>
      <p>Duesmann will be tasked with reinvigorating the company's <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/tag/advertising/">advertising</a> slogan "Vosprung Durch Technik," or "advancement through technology," with new meaning.</p>
      <p>"Markus Duesmann will do everything to unlock the huge potential of the Audi brand," Volkswagen Group Chief Executive Herbert Diess said on Friday.</p>
      <p>Wolfsburg-based <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/volkswagen/">VW</a> has been on the lookout for clean-engine expertise at Audi ever since it was discovered that engine management software, which was used to manipulate exhaust emissions tests at Volkswagen, was designed by Audi engineers.</p>
      <p>Duesmann is the second high-profile defection from rival German carmaker BMW after VW poached of Herbert Diess in July 2015.</p>
      <p>Audi's works council chief, Peter Mosch, welcomed the appointment of an external manager. "From Markus Duesmann and his team we expect the stable utilization of our factories and a more courageous approach."</p>
