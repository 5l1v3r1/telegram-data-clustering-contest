      <p>Cape Town – <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/Gossip/News/watch-charlize-theron-singing-along-and-fangirling-boyz-ii-men-is-the-best-thing-youll-see-today-20191113-2"><b>Charlize Theron hosted a fundraiser on Tuesday</b></a> for the Charlize Theron Africa Outreach Project (CTAOP) and shared the one lesson she makes sure to teach her kids: the importance of giving back.</p>
      <p>The <i>Bombshell</i> actress who rarely shares details about her children – Charlize adopted Jackson in 2011 and August in 2015 – told <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1093367/how-charlize-theron-is-teaching-her-kids-to-give-back"><b>E! News</b></a>, "I make a real point that very often we go and do something that is about service of others. When you put action to the words, the thing that you want your kids to learn, it's helpful," she said.</p>
      <p>"My kids love animals, and so they do a lot of volunteering at animal shelters. They clean up at shelters and things like that," she added.</p>
      <p>"We just try! We just try to be of good service to our community."</p>
      <p>Tuesday's event for CTAOP – which focuses on investing in youth and their future by fighting HIV in South Africa – was held at the Africa Center in New York City and attended by celebrity guests including Amy Schumer and <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/The-Juice/News/demi-leigh-dj-tira-and-david-kau-support-charlize-theron-at-her-fundraiser-in-new-york-20191113"><b>Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters</b></a>.</p>
