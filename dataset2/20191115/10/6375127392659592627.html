      <h3>A 17-YEAR-old resident of Kitaotao, Bukidnon who was said to have been kidnapped by still unidentified men outside his school on Thursday afternoon was found by the police in Cagayan de Oro City, police said.</h3>
      <p>The victim, a resident of Barangay Kalumihan in Kitaotao municipality, claimed he managed to escape from his captors and waited for help to come. He said that he later sought the attention of crewmen of a mobile patrol car along Tirso Neri-Tiano Streets in Cagayan de Oro City at 9:24 p.m. Thursday.</p>
      <p>A Police Regional Office 10 report said the victim was allegedly seized by occupants of a maroon Nissan van around 50 meters away from the Philippine Countryville College Inc. in Maramag, Bukidnon at 3 p.m. Thursday.</p>
      <p>Shortly after the incident was reported to the PRO10 headquarters, a flash alarm was raised for the interception of the car which was said to be last seen going towards the Cagayan de Oro area.</p>
      <p>The PRO10 said that officers patrolling along Tirso Neri-Tiano Streets late evening Thursday spotted a minor waiving at them and calling their attention.</p>
      <p>When the policemen approached the teenager, he told them that he was a kidnapping victim who managed to escape from his captors. The minor was taken to a local police station for documentation and investigation before being turned over to his father and the Kitaotao Municipal Police Staiton.</p>
      <p>PRO10 director, Brigadier General Rolando B. Anduyan said he has ordered an investigation into the teenagerâ€™s claim.</p>
