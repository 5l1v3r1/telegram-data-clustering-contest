      <h2>Sky Sports had looked set to challenge for the rights to the elite European competition</h2>

      <p>BT Sports have kept hold of all European football, including Champions League, Europa League and the new UEFA Europa Conference League, until 2024.</p>
      <p>The broadcaster has agreed a deal in excess of £1.2bn starting in 2021 after outbidding <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sky">Sky Sports</a> and ITV in the UK.</p>
      <p>BT have shown the elite European matches since 2015 on their subscription service although the Champions League and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/europa-league">Europa League</a> finals were available for free.</p>
      <p>It has now been confirmed that a deal has been agreed with BT Sport to show all 420 games live and air highlights for three seasons from 2021-2024.</p>
      <p>They will pay £400m per year as part of the deal with BT reporting a 26 per cent increase in UEFA Champions League viewing hours this season.</p>
      <p>Marc Allera, CEO of BT’s Consumer Division, said: “We’re delighted to remain the home of <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/uefa-champions-league">UEFA Champions League</a> in the UK.</p>
      <p>“BT Sport leads the way when it comes to UEFA Champions League coverage, and we’re very excited to continue to bring our world class coverage to one of the most exciting football competitions in the world - whether that’s broadcasting 12 games simultaneously or delivering industry leading images in 4K UHD.</p>
      <p>“With increasingly more ways to watch our content, with more games on show than ever before, and alongside our excellent line up of other competitions and sports, BT Sport is going from strength to strength.”</p>
