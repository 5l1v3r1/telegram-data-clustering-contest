      <h1>Waitrose launches new Christmas food range and it looks delicious</h1>
      <h2>The supermarket favourite is even releasing a giant jaffa cake dessert and we NEED it</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T10:29:27+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 10:29</time> by <a rel="author">Stacey Dutton, Chantelle Symester</a></address>
      <p>The Waitrose Christmas food offering for 2019 is packed with showstopping desserts and quality meat and trimmings.</p>
      <p>Shoppers who consider a trip to the family store will be able to get ready for the festivities with food orders now available until December 15.</p>
      <p>This year's Waitrose Christmas campaign with high street giant John Lewis has already stolen our hearts which tells the tale of an excitable dragon called Edgar who unintentionally sparks chaos as he strives to be accepted by his village.</p>
      <p>Now that the Christmas adverts are coming in fast, more of us will be visiting stores to get prepared for the Christmas rush.</p>
      <p>Those wanting to order at Waitrose will have items delivered between 20 and 24 December.</p>
      <p>The dishes available for 2019 will consist of some traditional flavours but with a Heston spin on one dessert which is set to be a showstopper- their Hesto's Fig and Port Cheesecake.</p>
      <p>With a huge increase in searches for vegan roasts last year, Waitrose have released plenty of vegan options to please everyone around the dinner table.</p>
      <p>There is also a new signature concoction hitting shelves in the form of their new plum, spiced ginger and honey flavour which we have spotted throughout a number of their new 2019 dishes.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the festive combination, Natalie Mitchell, Partner and Head of Product Innovation and Own Brand said: "Each Christmas we create a blend of ingredients that sums up our inspiration. This year's Plum, Spiced Ginger &amp; Honey combination brings tartness, spiced warmth and an aromatic sweetness that works with many classic dishes, from roast turkey to mince pies."</p>
      <h3>Signature Bacon Wrapped Turkey Breast</h3>

      <p>New for 2019 is a tasty sounding bacon wrapped turkey breast, which comes with a plum, spiced ginger and honey stuffing with tangy plum glaze. Perfect for anyone who doesn't want to cook a full turkey on the big day, but still wants the main event to be full of flavour.</p>
