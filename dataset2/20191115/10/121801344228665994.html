      <h2>The third season of the anthology counts Monica Lewinsky as a producer.</h2>

      <p>The third season of FX's <i>American Crime Story</i>, which focuses on the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, has found its POTUS.</p>
      <p>Clive Owen will join Sarah Paulson, Beanie Feldstein and Annaleigh Ashford in the cast for <i>Impeachment: American Crime Story</i>. The season will tell the story of Clinton's impeachment through the eyes of three women central to the probe: Monica Lewinsky (Feldstein), Linda Tripp (Paulson) and Paula Jones (Ashford). Lewinsky is also a producer on the coming season, which is due to air in 2020.</p>
      <p>The third season of the anthology is based on Jeffrey Toobin's book <i>A Vast Conspiracy: The Real Story of the Sex Scandal That Nearly Brought Down a President.</i> FX chief John Landgraf told <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> that then-first lady Hillary Clinton is <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/rambling-reporter/hillary-clinton-not-significant-impeachment-miniseries-says-fx-chief-1233211">"not one of the main characters"</a> in the story, though the casting of Owen suggests Bill Clinton will be heavily featured.</p>
      <p>The Hillary Clinton role is still being cast.</p>
      <p><i>Impeachment</i> is the second TV project Owen has signed onto in recent weeks; he's also set to star with Julianne Moore in <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/clive-owen-star-julianne-moore-apple-series-1246903"><i>Lisey's Story</i></a>, an adaptation of the Stephen King novel, for Apple TV+.</p>
      <p>Production on <i>Impeachment</i> is scheduled to begin in the spring for a fall premiere. Sarah Burgess is writing and will executive produce with <i>ACS</i> staples Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk, Nina Jacobson, Brad Simpson, Larry Karaszewski, Scott Alexander and Alexis Martin Woodall; Paulson and Feldstein are also EPs. Henrietta Conrad and Jemima Khan are producers along with Lewinsky. The series comes from Fox 21 and FX Productions.</p>
      <p>Murphy optioned Toobin's book in 2017, but later had second thoughts about doing a season on the Clinton-Lewinsky story. </p>
      <p>"I told [Lewinsky], 'Nobody should tell your story but you, and it's kind of gross if they do,'" <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/ryan-murphy-american-crime-story-future-scrapping-monica-lewinsky-season-1099146">Murphy told <i>The Hollywood Reporter </i>in April 2018</a>. "'If you want to produce it with me, I would love that; but you should be the producer and you should make all the goddamn money.'"</p>
      <p>Owen is repped by CAA and Hirsch Wallerstein.</p>
      <p><i>Deadline</i> first reported the news.</p>
