      <p>Professor Attahiru Jega, former chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission has said that improving the integrity of elections is key to the democratic development of any nation.</p>
      <p>Jega said this in Ibadan on Thursday while delivering a lecture to mark the 71st Foundation Day and Convocation of the University of Ibadan.</p>
      <p>The former INEC boss spoke on the topic, “Towards Credible Electoral Process and Sustainable Political Systems in Nigeria: What Role for Universities?”, said Nigeria could achieve greater integrity in its electoral process through the collaboration of stakeholders.</p>
      <p>“It is generally recognised that fortifying democracy is vital to sustainable development, but what is not as widely acknowledged is that improving the integrity of elections is key to democratic development.</p>
      <p>“Sustainable electoral process with requite integrity is the panacea for democratic development in Nigeria and in all African countries struggling with the challenges of democratisation.</p>
      <p>“The Nigerian electoral process has historically been flawed and repleted with profound challenges in all three key phases of electoral administration pre-election, election and post-election phases.</p>
      <p>“All stakeholders, therefore, must play a positive role in bridging these gaps,” he said.</p>
      <p>The former INEC boss commended the role of the academia in raising the bar of electoral administration in Nigeria since 2011.</p>
      <p>He, however, called for more collaboration by way of research, advocacy, training and mentoring of all actors involved, particularly in inventing in-house election-related equipment and technologies.</p>
