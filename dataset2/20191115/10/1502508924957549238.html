      <p>Mahendra Singh Dhoni has hit the nets in his hometown Ranchi but it is unlikely that the talismanic former captain will make himself available for the upcoming limited-overs home series against the West Indies next month.</p>
      <p>Dhoni, who has not played a competitive game since the World Cup semifinal against New Zealand in July, had a net session at the JSCA Stadium in Ranchi on Thursday, raising hopes of a comeback.</p>
      <p>However, he remains unavailable for the three T20s and as many ODIs against the West Indies starting December 6 in Mumbai.</p>
      <p>"He is not available for the West Indies series," a BCCI official told PTI on Friday.</p>
      <p>Ever since that World Cup semifinal loss to New Zealand, Dhoni's future has been a subject of intense speculation but the player himself has not spoken a word on it.</p>
      <p>The Indian team, as mentioned by chief selector MSK Prasad, seems to have moved on with Rishabh Pant becoming the number one choice in the shorter formats.</p>
      <p>Host broadcaster Star Sports wanted Dhoni to commentate in India's first-ever day-night Test, against Bangladesh, from November 22-26, but he will not be doing that as he remains a contracted player of the BCCI<br/><br/>As per the existing constitution, Dhoni commentating would have also amounted to conflict of interest.</p>
