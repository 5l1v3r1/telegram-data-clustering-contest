        <b>Arsenal have rekindled their interest in Leicester defender Caglar Soyuncu after watching him in action for Turkey on Thursday night, according to reports.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 23-year-old has been a revelation for Brendan Rodgers’ side so far this season, stepping in following the departure of Harry Maguire in impressive style.</p>
      <p>The Foxes have only conceded eight goals in their 12 Premier League games to date and, according to Turkish newspaper <i>Star</i>, Gunners scouts watched him for his country against Iceland in Euro 2020 qualifying action.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenal-sends-scouts-watch-leicester-20881629"><b>Daily Mirror</b></a> adds that Arsenal were keen on Soyuncu when he played for Freiburg, but were beaten to his signing by Leicester.</p>
      <p>In addition, <i>Star</i> reports that <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/arsenal"><b>Arsenal</b></a> were keeping an eye on Juventus’ Mehri Derimal in Thursday’s tie.</p>

      <p>However, they were not the only ones keeping an eye on Derimal, as it is claimed <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/manchester-united"><b>Manchester United</b></a> scouts were in attendance too.</p>
      <p>Turkey booked their place at Euro 2020 with a 0-0 draw against Iceland, with their final qualifier coming against Andorra on Sunday.</p>
