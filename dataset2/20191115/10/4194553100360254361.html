      <h1>“Ferocious” – Chris Sutton lauds LFC’s Oxlade-Chamberlain after England performance</h1>

      <p>Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain put in an impressive shift as England blew away Montenegro on Thursday night, with the Liverpool midfielder opening the scoring at just the tenth minute.</p>
      <p>Leicester City’s Ben Chilwell brought the ball in from the flank, and switch it to the Ox, before the Reds’ No.15 unleashed a venomous effort that gave the ‘keeper next to no chance.</p>

      <p>In truth, Chambo has been playing some great football of late so Liverpool fans won’t be too alarmed to hear he’s starred for England – I genuinely can’t think of a more exciting central midfielder playing for the Three Lions at the moment. Hopefully he can stay fit!</p>
      <p>But don’t just take my word for it, Chris Sutton is also a big fan of what Ox did as England thrashed Montenegro. “<b>Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, on his first England start since March 2018, opened the scoring in wonderful style,</b>” <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7687461/Alex-Oxlade-Chamberlain-set-ball-rolling-Wembley-England-win-against-Montenegro.html">he wrote in the Daily Mail.</a></p>
      <p>“<b>He set himself with his first touch then blasted a ferocious shot into the back of the net with his second. He made driving runs from midfield and was relentless in the centre of the pitch.</b>“</p>
      <p>And I agree – the man put in a shift which suggested he had been playing for England consistently these last two years – he hasn’t dropped a gear.</p>
      <p>We know how much playing for the country means to Ox, and we couldn’t be happier for him right now.</p>
