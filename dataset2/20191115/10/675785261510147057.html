      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T10:10:33+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 10:10</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>Roy Keane has offered some advice to fellow pundit Ian Wright ahead of his stint on I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> legend Wright is in the jungle this year with the hit ITV show launching on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Wright will follow in the footsteps of former footballers Neil Ruddock, Jimmy Bullard and Harry Redknapp, who won the show in 2018.</p>
      <p>Wright missed England's victory over Montenegro on Thursday night with the 56-year-old a regular pundit for ITV, alongside Keane.</p>
      <p>Discussing his stint in the jungle, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> legend Keane said: I'm looking forward to watching it but I've asked him 'please don't cry whilst you're in there'."</p>

      <p>Wright's former teammate Lee Dixon also had his say on his involvement in the show.</p>
      <p>"He's either going to win it or he will be out after an hour because it's Wrighty," Dixon said.</p>
      <p>"He loves his food, his sleep and he doesn't like to be buried. There's every chance of that all going wrong, it'll be good watching.</p>
      <p>"He loves his food, he loves his Nancy's cooking. He can cook himself but there will be nothing to eat!"</p>

      <p>Former Arsenal defender Ashley Cole was coming through the ranks during Wright's time in north London.</p>
      <p>Cole added: "He was a bit of the joker and as a young kid if we used to see him he'd kick you up the bum, meg you, 'go get me a cup of tea', 'get my boots' so we'd try to hide from him as much as possible."</p>
