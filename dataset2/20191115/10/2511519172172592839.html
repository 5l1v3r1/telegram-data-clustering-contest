      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/LiamGallagher">Liam Gallagher</a> has tweeted his condolences to a fan who had urine thrown at them during his gig in Cardiff, saying it was a “proper p***-take”.</p>
      <p>The singer kicked off his UK tour in the Welsh city on Monday 11 November in a concert that saw him play "Gas Panic" with former Oasis guitarist Bonehead.</p>
      <p>“I’d like to apologise to the guy who had wee thrown over him at the Cardiff gig,” Gallagher wrote, “that’s a proper p*** take that no need c’mon you know LG x.”</p>
      <p>Lower down in the Twitter thread, Gallagher says he has had “plenty of p***” aimed at him during his career and when a fan asked what the craziest thing anyone’s thrown at him on stage he replied: “A kettle.”</p>
      <p>Asked what he thinks of his brother Noel’s new song “Wandering Star”, Liam said: “Don’t mind it actually better than the pile of s*** he’s been putting out his voice is wank though sounds like he’s lost the winning lottery ticket.”</p>
      <p>The Gallagher siblings have exchanged insults with each other over social media and in print ever since Noel left Oasis in 2009.</p>
      <p>In September, Liam <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/liam-noel-gallagher-oasis-feud-real-reason-a9105106.html">seemed to hint</a> that music writing was the "real thing" that caused Oasis to split up and triggered his longstanding feud with Noel.</p>
