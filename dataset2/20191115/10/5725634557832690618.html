      <p>Summary</p>
      <ul>
        <li>All stocks have at least five fiscal years of dividend growth history and come from the U.S. Dividend Champions List.</li>
        <li>12 increases for next week (down from 16 last week).</li>
        <li>An average increase of 8.46%, median increase of 7.05% and four with an increase of at least 10%.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Introduction</b>
      </p>
      <p>This article series is designed to keep investors informed of upcoming dividend increases. For dividend growth investors, this can be an opportunity to start or add to positions prior to a new increased payout. This can be especially important for retirees who live on dividend checks.</p>
      <p>The lists I've compiled provide various stats for the stocks that are increasing their dividends next week.</p>
      <p>This list is a trimmed-down version only covering dividend increases. A full upcoming dividend calendar is always available <a href="https://www.customstockalerts.com/dividendCalendar">here</a>. If you know how this was built and the caveats, feel free to jump down to the lists themselves.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How It's Assembled</b>
      </p>
      <p>The information presented below was created by combining the "U.S. Dividend Champions" spreadsheet hosted <a href="http://www.dripinvesting.org/tools/tools.asp">here</a> with upcoming dividend information from Nasdaq. This meshes metrics about companies with dividend growth history with upcoming dividend payments (and whether those payments are increasing). These companies all have a minimum five-year dividend growth history.</p>
      <p>As a point of clarification, companies are included that may not raise their dividend every calendar year, but the total annual dividend received will still be higher each year. One such example is Bank of America (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BAC">BAC</a>).</p>
      <p>In the table <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BAC/dividends/dividend-growth">here</a> on SA, the annual dividend payout received by a shareholder increased for each year in this time frame. Thus, it is eligible for inclusion in the "CCC" list.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>That said, it did pay out the same amount for eight quarters in a row, but again, the total annual amount increased each year.</p>

      <p>United Technologies (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UTX">UTX</a>) is another <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UTX/dividends/history">example</a>.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What Is the Ex-Dividend Date?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The "ex-dividend" date is the date you are no longer entitled to the dividend or distribution. You need to have made your purchase by the preceding business day. If the date is a Tuesday, you need to have purchased (or already owned) shares by market close on Monday. Be aware that for any stock going ex-dividend on a Monday (or Tuesday, if Monday is a holiday), you must own it by the prior Friday.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Dividend Streak Categories</b>
      </p>
      <p>Here are the definitions of the streak categories as I'll be using them throughout the piece:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>King: 50+ years</li>
        <li>Champion/Aristocrat: 25+ years</li>
        <li>Contender: 10-24 years</li>
        <li>Challenger: 5+ years</li>
      </ul>

        <b>Bonus</b>
      </p>
      <p>Microsoft is in the spotlight this week. It has delivered another 11% dividend increase and a $40 billion stock buyback in the same announcement. This tech giant has tremendously pivoted since Satya Nadella took over for Steve Ballmer. Microsoft is growing rapidly and stands as the #2 player in the cloud computing space behind Amazon (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN">AMZN</a>) with AWS. This <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-07-29-gartner-says-worldwide-iaas-public-cloud-services-market-grew-31point3-percent-in-2018">Gartner</a> report from July pegs AWS as having 48% share, with Microsoft at 15.5%. Now I will note - this numbers are using full-year 2018 cloud revenues. As 2019 comes to a close, we will almost certainly see Microsoft's share increase substantially. These two titans seem poised to split this market with a few other distant niche players.</p>
      <p>Even looking over the second quarter that was <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3508841-microsoft-forecasts-q2-intelligent-cloud-strength">reported</a> a few weeks ago, cloud revenues are now over $11 billion per quarter, up 36% year over year, and it is also now the leading segment by revenue. Total revenues were up 14% from last year. This is a company that is firing on all cylinders.</p>
      <p>Satya Nadella took over the corner office in early 2014, and after two slow years, the earnings growth has been off the charts. 2017 saw 19% EPS growth, 2018 saw 17% growth and 2019 saw 22% growth. Forward-looking estimates are still for double-digit growth. This seems highly likely with the double-digit revenue growth expected.</p>

      <p>Another thing to note is that Microsoft is one of two companies that sport a AAA credit rating (the other being Johnson &amp; Johnson (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JNJ">JNJ</a>)). Lastly, I want to highlight that yes, while the overall P/E has grown over time, it has been well-earned as Microsoft saw its second growth resurgence. A P/E of 18 in 2014 moving up to the current P/E of about 30 looks justified. In fact, after the bottom on Christmas Eve of 2018, shares are up over 50%.</p>

      <p>Going by data from Simply Safe Dividends, Microsoft is in the upper echelon of dividend-paying companies. It scores wonderfully in the dividend safety and growth score at the expense of current yield. I personally look for businesses with a total score over 200, which Microsoft is with its total of 205.</p>
      <figure>

      <p>The company has historically been good about a 10% annual dividend increase, so this year's 11% is no different. Microsoft has increased dividends for 18 years now - so many of those years were the slower Ballmer years. The payout ratio continues to be low and manageable and a nice sweet spot for a company like this. There is a lot of free cash flow left over to grow the business, pay down debt or buy back shares.</p>
      <p>Speaking of free cash flow, this is the annual free cash flow thrown off by Microsoft. Its trailing twelve-month free cash is nearly $39 billion! The company continues to also have a growing cash problem (what a first-world problem). The $40 billion buyback is essentially just one year's worth of free cash flow. Of course, it is paying out dividends as well, but the headline amount is essentially just what the company generates each year.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Over the past 5 years, management has done a nice job reducing the share count by 7%. With shares at historical all-time highs, expect the rate of share retirement to be lower. You can visually see it with the steep curve flattening out the past few years.</p>

        <b>Stock Returns</b>
      </p>
      <p>I ran a stock return calculation comparing MSFT to <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY">SPY</a> since this time in 2010.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/11/14/9020091-15737591901950443.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Microsoft annihilated the market with a 600% return to 208% from the market. The powerful effect of compounding dividends also saw the company generate 50% more income for the holder.</p>
      <p>Here's the look at the investments over time:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>MSFT is the blue line.</li>
        <li>SPY is the black line.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>With a long tail going back to 2010 and before the cloud revolution, you can see that Microsoft was a market perform for several years. As the company began its resurgence, you can see the lion's share of its outperformance has been in the past 4 years.</p>
