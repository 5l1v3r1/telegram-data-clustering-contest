      <h1>Nvidia's quarterly earnings beat expectations thanks to gaming and hyperscale growth</h1>
      <h2>But the next quarter might not be as rosy</h2>

      <h4>What just happened? Nvidia has revealed its third-quarter financial results, and while the company did beat expectations, revenue fell 5 percent compared to the same quarter one year ago.</h4>
      <p>In the <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-third-quarter-fiscal-2020">quarter</a> ending October 27, Nvidia reported revenue of $3.01 billion. While that’s down from the $3.18 billion a year earlier, it’s a 17 percent jump over the $2.58 billion from the previous quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $1.78, compared with $1.84 a year earlier and $1.24 in the previous quarter.</p>
      <p>"Our gaming business and demand from hyperscale customers powered Q3’s results," said CEO Jensen Huang. "The realism of computer graphics is taking a giant leap forward with NVIDIA RTX."</p>

      <p>Breaking down Nvidia’s segments, its GPU business revenue was down 8 percent to $2.56 billion, while gaming revenue was down 6 percent YoY to $1.66 billion but up 26 percent from the previous quarter. The quarterly increase was spurred by growth in its GeForce desktop and gaming GPUs.</p>
      <p>Data center revenue was also down YoY, to $726 million, but the company believes the business will see strong sequential growth in this segment “driven by the rise of conversational AI and inference.” Its automobile sector, meanwhile, earned $162 million and the professional visualization segment hit $324 million, up 6 percent.</p>
      <p>The figures beat expectations, with analysts looking for earnings at $1.57 per share on revenue of $2.91 billion. For the fourth quarter, Nvidia expects revenue of $2.95 billion, which is lower than Wall Street’s $3.06 billion prediction.</p>
