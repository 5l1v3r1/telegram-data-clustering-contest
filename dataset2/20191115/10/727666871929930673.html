      <p>Some social media users are calling the G-Unit Film &amp; Television boss a cyber-bully.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News)</b> 50 Cent may be off Instagram at the moment, but that has not stopped him from continuing his trolling on Twitter. The latest target is his own<i> Power</i> co-star/employee Naturi Naughton.</p>
      <p>Fiddy posted another meme making fun of Naughton's hairstyle by comparing her to the character Goro from <i>Mortal Kombat</i>. He wrote as a caption, "😠Who the f*ck did this, POWER is #1." This came after 50 apologized to Naughton earlier this month for posting the picture on IG.</p>
      <p>The former 3LW singer responded to the <i>Power</i> executive producer's latest jokes on Twitter and Instagram. She tweeted, "@50cent Did we have a fight and I not know about it? 🤷🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️ so confused. #SoMuchForPowerFam #FinalSeason." </p>
      <p>Naughton also wrote on Instagram, "😔There’s so much I wanna say but... You don’t even have an Instagram account so... 🤷🏾‍♀️ why waste my characters or come out of my CHARACTER! But do pick up a copy of my upcoming book: #whatNOTtoDoWhenYoureABoss 🤦🏾‍♀️ #ImNotACharacter #IAmARealPerson #IAmAWoman #IAmABlackWoman."</p>
