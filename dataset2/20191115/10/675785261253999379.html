      <p>BT Sport have confirmed they have retained Champions League TV rights in the UK in a staggering £1.2bn deal.</p>
      <p>ITV had been hoping to win back the rights but BT have announced they have retained rights to the competition until 2024.</p>
      <p>They have secured the rights to all 420 games in the Champions League, Europa League and the new UEFA Conference League.</p>
      <p>Sky Sports, who had previously held the rights, had also mounted a challenge but missed out to BT.</p>
      <p>The new deal will come into play in 2021 and will offer an increase of 77 matches from the current contract.</p>
      <p>BT have confirmed they will pay £400m each year for the rights.</p>
