        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lewis-hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> may have sealed another Formula 1 World Championship but that doesn't mean he doesn't respect his rivals and none more so than <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/sebastian-vettel">Sebastian Vettel</a>. The Brit has revealed the level of respect for each other has grown over time.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hamilton wrapped up his sixth Formula 1 title last time out at the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/grandsprix/united-states-grand-prix">US Grand Prix</a>. It moved him one behind Michael Schumacher and two ahead of Sebastian Vettel. Between them, Hamilton and Vettel have won nine of the last ten Drivers' Championship with the only other victor being Nico Rosberg's win in 2016.</p>
      <p>It was clear the level of respect the two F1 greats have for each other after Vettel congratulated Hamilton after the title was sealed in Austin. The 2019 World Champion believes they've respected each other more and more as time has gone by.</p>

      <p><i>“Me and Seb have a huge amount of respect for each other, and I think it’s grown over time,"</i> Hamilton told the F1 website.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Being at the forefront of the sport and both appreciating just how hard it is, individually, for us to do what we do. And I guess also over time Seb does his thing his own way, I do it my own way and we respect that about each other.</i>
