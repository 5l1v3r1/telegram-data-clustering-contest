        <i>This much-desired tuxedo jacket by Anthony Vaccarello takes on Yves Saint Laurent’s definitive contribution to fashion, ‘Le Smoking’</i>
      </p>
      <p>When <b>Yves Saint Laurent</b> first showed ‘Le Smoking’ in 1966 – a black, satin-lapelled tuxedo, cut for the shape of a woman – his haute couture clients were nonplussed, and only a single one was sold. <a href="https://www.anothermag.com/tag/yves-saint-laurent">Saint Laurent</a> nonetheless persevered: a version of the tuxedo jacket, shown later as part of the house’s younger Rive Gauche line, was an instant bestseller. “For a woman, the tuxedo is an indispensable garment in which she will always feel in style, for it is a stylish garment and a not a fashionable garment,” Saint Laurent would later say. He was correct: ‘Le Smoking’ has endured.</p>
      <p>Anthony Vaccarello, the house’s current creative director, is an avid student of the Saint Laurent archive, finding inspiration in both the well- and less-known corners of the designer’s oeuvre – Vaccarello’s first collection began within an obsession with a singular obscure puffed-sleeve party dress from 1982, while others have referenced Saint Laurent’s epochal collections, like 1976’s ‘<a href="https://museeyslparis.com/en/biography/collection-opera-ballets-russes-ah">Ballet Russes</a>’. On the runway, he re-presents them with new frisson and verve – hemlines are high, necklines low, silhouettes amplified.</p>
      <p>For Autumn/Winter 2019, Vaccarello referenced two of Yves’ glamorous coterie of muses, <a href="https://www.anothermag.com/search?q=Catherine+Deneuve">Catherine Deneuve</a> and Betty Catroux. The latter came with her own ice-haired doppelganger, Swedish model Vilma Sjöberg, who was the second exit in a black mini-dress, sunglasses and an ivory wool coat with exaggerated power-shoulders. This silhouette was the collection’s signature: “Everything starts from the shoulder,” Vaccarello said. Such was the case for this season’s take on ‘Le Smoking’, too – wide-lapelled, in black satin or white satin and invariably worn with nothing beneath, the shoulders were cut with wide, mannish proportions. “She is really strong, she’s fearless,” said Vaccarello.</p>
      <p>Here, a black tuxedo jacket from the collection – in perhaps its most desirable iteration, entirely embellished with strass rhinestones and sequins – is captured by photographer <a href="https://www.anothermag.com/art-photography/12069/city-of-spiders-a-new-book-capturing-women-in-their-own-spaces">Maxime Imbert</a> and AnOther’s junior fashion editor, <a href="https://www.anothermag.com/user/RebeccaPerlmutar">Rebecca Perlmutar</a>. </p>
