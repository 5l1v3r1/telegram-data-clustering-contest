      <h1>6 Euro standouts who Celtic could target during January window profiled</h1>
      <h2>Neil Lennon has hinted at January reinforcements and there are some exciting options on the continent.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T10:06:16+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 10:06</time> by <a rel="author">Graeme Young, Chris Doyle, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/graeme-young/, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/chris-doyle/, Robbie Copeland</a></address>
      <p>Celtic find themselves hot on the heels of a triumphant summer recruitment drive that has them top of the Premiership and flying high in Europe, but as far as signings go, they won't be stopping there.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a> has hinted at reinforcements, while new head of football operations Nick Hammond will have his first chance to show what he can do when the January transfer window opens up.</p>
      <p>The champions always cast their net wide and are reportedly keen on former Bayern Munich midfielder Niklas Dorsch who has been turning heads with Bundesliga.2 side Heidenheim.</p>
      <p>And Lennon's quest to shore up his engine room comes as no surprise considering the summer pursuit of former Brentford pass-master Romaine Sawyers, before his transfer to boyhood club West Brom. Victor Wanyama was also discussed but a return for the Kenyan enforcer didn't materialise.</p>
      <p>While steel and flair in midfield may be the main priority, another striker wouldn't go amiss either. <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/odsonne-edouard">Odsonne Edouard</a> is firing but Leigh Griffiths is struggling with injury and Vakoun Issouf Bayo is proving increasingly unfancied, leaving Lennon with a selection conundrum should his main man need a rest.</p>
      <p><i><b>Record Sport</b> </i>runs the rule over six players who are turning heads this season and fit the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> transfer profile.</p>
      <h3>Evander (Midtjylland)</h3>

      <p>Celtic have scouts all across the globe but their top talent-spotters would only have had to cross the Kingston Bridge to get an up close and personal view of an emerging Brazilian midfielder that has everyone talking.</p>
      <p>Rangers thoroughly outclassed Midtjylland over two legs during <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/europa-league">Europa League</a> qualifying but Evander's all-action display left a lasting impression on everyone in attendance.</p>
      <p>There's a feeling the 21-year-old can go much further than the Danish league and his goal at Ibrox proved he also has a keen eye for goal. The classy former Vasco da Gama star has also provided six assists in the Superliga.</p>
      <p>And Celtic will have an inside track with former Hoops star Erik Sviatchenko playing alongside the creative force on a weekly basis.</p>
      <h3>Shon Weissman (FC Wolfsberger)</h3>

      <p>Top teams are standing up and taking notice of Israel international Weissman's goal-laden start to the season in Austria.</p>
      <p>And the Israeli market is one Celtic and Lennon know well with current Parkhead stars Nir Bitton and Hatem Abd Elhamed on the Parkhead books and international team-mates of Weissman.</p>
      <p>The striker is yet to break his international duck but has no problem finding the net for his club. The former Maccabi Haifa forward has scored 18 goals in 20 appearances this season.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The 23-year-old looks set to follow in the footsteps of compatriot Moanes Dabour who earned his big move to Sevilla off the back of a brilliant scoring run with Red Bull Salzburg.</p>
      <p>Weissman truly announced his arrival with a goal in the Austrian upstarts win over Monchengladbach in the Europa League. A serious talent and his price is only set to rise as the goals continue to flow.</p>
      <p>Weissman is a proper No.9 and is at his best in and around the box. His fleet-footed work with defenders surrounding him bears similarities to former Parkhead favourite Gary Hooper.</p>
      <h3>Kamil Jozwiak (Lech Poznan)</h3>

      <p>Every great Celtic side have been built on solid foundations but the Hoops have always been at their best with wide men who can carve up the opposition.</p>
      <p>That's certainly the case with current side with James Forrest and loan star Mohamed Elyounoussi ripping teams to shreds on a weekly basis. Mikey Johnston's return is a boost but Scott Sinclair, Lewis Morgan and Marian Shved aren't on the same level. </p>
      <p>Jozwiak is a livewire and the right-footed left winger has five assists on the season. He's all limbs when running with the ball and his ungainly style when moving at pace evokes memories of former Denmark and Chelsea standout Jesper Gronkjaer.</p>
      <p>His goal in the 4-0 win over Wisla Krakow was a counter-attacking masterpiece and his ability to race past defenders is one of his finest traits. Elyounoussi has been an incredible acquisition but other options must be considered if another loan deal with Southampton isn't an option. </p>
      <h3>Evert Linthorst (VVV Venlo)</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article20881467.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/2_Evert-Linthorst.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Linthorst is turning heads with his hometown team. The 6ft 2in midfielder looks the part in the heart of the midfield with his passing ability and eye for a goal.</p>
      <p>He's netted four goals in 11 appearances this season, owing to his perfectly-timed runs into the box, but he's also adept at breaking play up in the midfield - as evidenced by his average of almost 3.5 interceptions per game. His side have lost five on the spin, but Linthorst never shies away from the ball.</p>
      <p>The Eredivisie may be notoriously slow-paced compared to breakneck tempo of SPFL, but at just 19, he appears a player capable of making the grade if given time to adapt.</p>
      <p>He would provide a versatile option, capable of operating from deep as well higher up the pitch. David Turnbull was a target but Linthorst appears to be a more well-rounded player.</p>
      <h3>Antonio Mance (Osijek)</h3>

      <h3> </h3>
      <p>With Griffiths struggling with injury and Bayo not yet fully trusted, it is possible the Parkhead boss may find himself looking around for an alternative goalscorer to the on-fire Edouard  - and could find what he is after in Croatian ace Mance.</p>
      <p>With five goals and three assists in 15 appearances this season, the 24-year-old has shown he has the attributes of true all-round striker, and is as effective physically as he is with the ball at his feet.</p>
      <p>Though he finds himself on a mini goal-drought at present, having not netted in his last four, he has proven to be relentlessly effective at getting into positions to score goals throughout his first season with Osijek - even if his expected goals average of 0.45 per game isn't quite reflected in his scoring record.</p>
      <p>Mance has the presence to offer a viable alternative to Edouard, which is something Celtic are lacking at present.</p>
      <p>He has the ability to chip in on the scoring front and potentially rival the big Frenchman for the number nine jersey should he be given the chance. </p>
      <h3>Romano Schmid (Wolfsberger, on loan from Werder Bremen)</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article20881499.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Romano-Schmid.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>A team-mate of Weissman's, Romano Schmid is the man who makes Gerhard Struber's side tick.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old does a little bit of everything in the heart of the midfield and is equally adept in breaking play up as he is in launching attacks.</p>
      <p>He plays on the right side of Wolsberger's midfield three and is earning regular game time back in his homeland on loan from Werder Bremen.</p>
      <p>Schmid has lived quite the nomadic existence for one so young after being on the books of both Sturm Graz and Red Bull Salzburg, but looks to have hit the ground running back in Austria after joining Bremen in January. He is poised to set the Bundesliga alight once he returns to the German giants in the summer - unless someone moves to poach him away.</p>
      <p>He's shown he has a clear creative spark with his seven assists since heading back home, and with the flair he provides in central positions, could prove to be the key to unlocking Premiership defences.</p>
