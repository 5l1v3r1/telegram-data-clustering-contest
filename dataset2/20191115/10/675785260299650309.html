      <h1>Barcelona 'upset' after failing to complete Gabriel Martinelli transfer before Arsenal</h1>
      <h2>The highly-rated forward had a trial at Old Trafford and also spent time at Barca's famed La Masia academy this year before deciding on a switch to north London</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T10:24:49+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 10:24</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Barcelona chiefs are reportedly fuming that they missed out on Arsenal new boy Gabriel Martinelli.</p>
      <p>The starlet, 18, made a £6million move to the Emirates in the summer from Brazilian side Ituano and has made a positive impact despite the club's struggles under Unai Emery.</p>
      <p>And it has now emerged that Arsenal beat <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> and Premier League rivals <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> to his signature.</p>
      <p>The highly-rated forward had a trial at Old Trafford and also spent time at Barca's famed La Masia academy this year before deciding on a switch to north London.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.mundodeportivo.com/futbol/fc-barcelona/20191115/471609996563/malestar-en-el-barca-al-escaparse-martinelli.html">Mundo Deportivo</a> , Nou Camp bosses regret not pursuing their interest in the forward.</p>

      <p>Earlier this month, Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp described Arsenal striker Martinelli as a 'talent of the century' after the teenager's impressive Carabao Cup display at Anfield.</p>
      <p>The 18-year-old scored twice during the 5-5 draw as the Reds won on penalties book a quarter-final meeting with Aston Villa.</p>
      <p>He reacted quickly to a smart stop from Caoimhin Kelleher to finish from close range in the 26th minute - with the scores level at 1-1 - before adding a second ten minutes later, producing an emphatic first-time finish from a Bukayo Saka cross.</p>
      <p>Although his brace was not enough to see Unai Emery's side advance in the competition, it was yet another impressive display from the teenager, who already has seven goals in as many appearances for his new club.</p>

      <p>And Klopp, who made 11 changes for the tie and handed to starts to several <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> youngsters, was full of the praise for Martinelli as he paid tribute to the contributions of some of his younger players.</p>
      <p>“Sepp van den Berg played an incredible game," the Reds' boss told <a href="https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/371358-jurgen-klopp-liverpool-arsenal-ticket-reaction">Liverpoolfc.com</a> .</p>
      <p>“That’s really difficult to deal with these guys. Martinelli’s pretty much the same age but he’s a talent of the century, he’s an incredible striker, so it’s really difficult.</p>
      <p>“Then you have Mesut Ozil around and Willock right, who scored by the way a really nice one, so a team like <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> in a counter-attacking mood – we keep them deep, play around them, we lose the ball and then it’s really difficult."</p>
