      <p>Cape Town – The thrilling saga in M-Net’s original five-part crime series <i>Trackers</i> continues.</p>
      <p>If you haven’t watched the first three episodes of this exhilarating production, based on bestselling author Deon Meyer’s gripping novel yet, get up to speed fast before Sunday’s fourth instalment on <b>M-Net (DStv 101</b><b>)</b> at <b>20:00</b>. You can binge-watch the edge-of-your-seat drama on <a href="https://now.dstv.com/"><b>DStv Catch Up</b></a> or <b><a href="https://www.showmax.com/eng/welcome/za">ShowMax</a></b>.</p>
      <p>For those who have been watching: What will happen to Milla? The PBI arrested her after identifying her as the mystery women at Lucas Becker’s side on the surveillance photograph. To make it worse, this happened while she was compiling a dossier on Lucas. Was she really seeing an undercover CIA agent? Unlike the PBI, viewers know it was Lemmer, and not Lucas, who killed "The Bull" Inkunzi. In the meantime, gung-ho Lemmer has met his match.</p>
      <p>When the last episode’s end credits rolled he was held at gunpoint by the feisty vixen who disappeared with his gun – and the diamonds everyone is trying to track down. What will happen next?</p>
