      <p>The Killers have announced a 2020 UK stadium tour as they prepare to release their sixth studio album, Imploding the Mirage, this spring.</p>
      <p>The best-selling band won't be coming to Wales - but will take to the stage at Bristol's Ashton Gate, just a short drive from Cardiff, on <b>Tuesday, June 9.</b></p>
      <p>The tour marks the first for the indie group since they headlined Glastonbury Festival this year, just a day after <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/killers-cardiff-castle-review-bands-16503813">their sellout gig at Cardiff Castle</a> .</p>
      <p>Supported by Sam Fender, Blossoms and Manic Street Preachers, they'll perform just nine shows in the UK across May and June.</p>
