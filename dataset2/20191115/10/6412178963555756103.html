        <b>Arsenal’s chances of keeping loanee Dani Ceballos have taken a lift after a report claimed he will refuse to return to Real Madrid.</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>AS</i> claim that Ceballos will not return to Real Madrid as long as Zinedine Zidane is manager at the Bernabeu.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard’s “bad relationship” with Zidane means he will opt against deciding to head back to Spain, meaning Arsenal’s hopes of keeping the 23-year-old will be boosted.</p>
      <p>Ceballos apparently held talks recently with Real Madrid president Florentino Perez to discuss a permanent departure after <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/ceballos-takes-ramseys-number-as-arsenal-confirm-loan-signing"><b>arriving on a season-long loan from Madrid in the summer.</b></a></p>
      <p>He reportedly asked for the deal not to include an option to buy at the time as he aimed to return to make an impact in Madrid, and Perez was understood to be happy with that arrangement.</p>
      <p>Since then though a report from <i>El Desmarque</i> explained he was “willing” to leave Spain for Unai Emery’s side on a permanent deal.</p>
      <p>Then, just days later the same source reported that Arsenal’s €30m offer was rejected because Perez wanted €35m for Ceballos, who has been a hit with Arsenal fans.</p>
      <p>Ceballos recently claimed he “fully intends” to return to Real Madrid once his loan spell at Arsenal is over – and said quotes claiming he wanted a permanent move to the north London outfit were misunderstood.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/ceballos-takes-ramseys-number-as-arsenal-confirm-loan-signing"><b>The Gunners loan recruit arrived in July from the Bernabeu on a 12-month deal </b></a>and he has endured a mixed start to his career in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>“I am now at Arsenal and I feel very good,” he told Marca. “I was clear that I wanted to leave. I have been successful leaving Madrid. Right now I am where I want to be and I am very happy.</p>
      <p>“My idea was to go out, play and enjoy football. In the previous two years I had not done so.”</p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/tag/dani-ceballos"><b>Ceballos </b></a>later went on to explain that quitting Real Madrid permanently is the last thing on his mind.</p>
      <p>Asked about not enjoying his time at Real, Ceballos clarified to <i>Radio MARCA</i>: “My words were misunderstood. [What I meant to say, was] When I do not play, I don’t enjoy myself.”</p>
      <p>Ceballos, a €14m recruit from Real Betis, has made 17 appearances this season and has shown enough to suggest he could be a real asset for the Gunners.</p>
