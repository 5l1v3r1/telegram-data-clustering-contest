      <h1>Luyanda Botha handed 3 life terms for raping, killing Uyinene Mrwetyana</h1>

      <p>Former post office worker Luyanda Botha will serve life in prison for the rape and murder of Uyinene Mrwetyana, in terms of a plea and sentencing agreement heard in the Western Cape High Court.</p>
      <p>The court heard on Friday that Botha, 42, pleaded guilty to raping and killing UCT student Mrwetyana earlier this year.</p>
      <p>According to the agreement, Botha will serve a life sentence for murder, two life sentences on both counts of rape, and five years for defeating the course of justice. The five-year sentence will run concurrently.</p>
      <p>He will not be eligible for parole for 25 years. Judge Gayaat Salie-Hlophe confirmed the sentence.</p>
      <p>Standing in the dock of the Western Cape High Court for what was initially set down as a pre-trial on Friday, Botha appeared calm and emotionless and said he understood the charges.</p>
      <p>"The State has also consulted with the parents and family of the deceased fully and I have explained in great detail the contents of the document and the processes to be followed," said State prosecutor Advocate Rodney de Kock.</p>
      <p>Mrwetyana's family were in court as proceedings continued, including the graphic details of Botha's plea.</p>
      <p>Botha was charged with twice raping 19-year-old Mrwetyana, a first-year University of Cape Town student, before bludgeoning her to death on August 24.</p>

      <p>Botha admitted in his plea that he organised to be alone with Mrwetyana in the locked Clareinch Post Office that day by telling her a parcel was ready. He had met her two weeks earlier when she first enquired about the package.</p>
      <p>He made sexual advances towards her but she did not respond and looked scared, he said.</p>
      <p>"I grabbed her by the waist and forcibly pulled her closer to me... the deceased fought while I sexually violated her," he admitted.</p>
      <p>He then raped her.</p>
      <p>"She managed to run to the door but I caught up with her and knocked her to the ground."</p>
      <p>He then dragged her to the post office safe and locked her inside while she was still screaming.</p>
      <p>"I choked the deceased and she fought back and kicked me."</p>
      <p>He took a 2kg weight, used to weigh the packages received at the post office, and used it to kill her, targeting her head.</p>
      <p>Botha then left the post office, drank alcohol and returned to cover her body with cushions, a blanket and a jersey.</p>
      <p>He returned the next day and found the area covered in blood. He cleaned up and waited until dark to remove her body in a large postal mail bag in his car.</p>
      <p>Once at a field in Lingelethu West, Khayelitsha, he dumped her body in a shallow hole before dousing it with petrol and setting it alight.</p>
      <p>De Kock said she was killed in a "callous and vicious manner for no other reason than that she rebuffed the sexual advances of the accused".</p>
      <p>Aggravating factors included that he misused his position to gain her trust, he had previous convictions, and that gender-based violence was a scourge on society.</p>
      <p>Botha made a confession and pointed out the scene after being arrested.</p>
      <p>De Kock said no substantial and compelling circumstances existed to warrant a departure from the minimum sentence of life imprisonment.</p>
      <p>Addressing the Mrwetyana family, Salie-Hlophe said no sentence could bring back their loved one, but she hoped it provided some closure and would help with their painful and difficult path to healing.</p>
      <p>"She fought bravely and courageously. This was indeed a heinous and cruel act and crime. Though it may be cold comfort to you today, it is not without significance that she was a fighter and clearly had a fighting spirit for her life," the judge added.</p>
      <p>She said Mrwetyana would be remembered as a hero and iconic champion in the fight to end gender-based violence.</p>
