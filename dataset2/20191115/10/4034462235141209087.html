      <h1>LEAKED: This Is The Ford Mustang Mach-E Before You’re Meant To See It</h1>
      <h2>An online configurator has leaked photos and specification details just days before the official reveal.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T10:47:26+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 10:47</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Bigg</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/ford/mach-e">Ford Mustang Mach-E</a> will make its world debut in just a few days on November 17 at an event in LA <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/hollywood-star-to-present-ford-mustang-inspired-electric-suv">hosted by Idris Alba</a>. Unfortunately for Ford, the surprise has been spoiled because photos and details of the electric SUV have already leaked online. Ironically, they were leaked directly from Ford, as someone made the SUV's online configurator live too early. Ford quickly removed the page, but members of the <a href="https://www.macheforum.com/site/threads/discovered-2021-mustang-mach-e-official-page-w-pricing-models-specs-video-etc.49/">MachE Forum</a> saved some screen captures.</p>
      <p>We get a good look at the electric SUV from just about every angle, and the similarities to the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/ford/mustang">Mustang </a>pony car are abundant from the headlights and taillights to the front fascia and muscular fenders. There's also a closed-off grille that resembles the Mustang's grille. A photo of the interior shows the Mustang Mach-E will have a Tesla-esque cabin, with a large, tablet-style display and another digital display behind the steering wheel.</p>

      <p>It wasn't just photos that leaked either, as the configurator also listed specification and performance details. Five trims will be available, including Select, California Rt. 1, Premium, First Edition, and GT.</p>
      <p>The base Select model will feature an electric motor delivering around 255 hp and 306 lb-ft of torque with RWD and 429 lb-ft of torque with AWD. With RWD, the Mach-E Select will deliver a range of 230 miles, while the AWD model offers a range of 210 miles. 0-62 mph will take around 6.5 seconds in the RWD model and around 5.5 seconds in the AWD model. Pricing for the base Mach-E will start at $43,895, which is around the same as the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/tesla/model-y">Tesla Model Y</a>.</p>
      <p>Starting at $50,600, the Premium model is also available with AWD or RWD and comes with additional luxuries including 19-inch wheels. It shares the same powertrain options as the Select, but also has extended range options delivering 282 hp and 300 miles in the RWD version and 333 hp and 270 miles in the AWD version .</p>

      <p>Sitting at the top of the range is the GT model.

Available only in AWD, the GT model has a driving range of around 235 miles and starts at $60,500.
