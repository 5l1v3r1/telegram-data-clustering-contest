      <p>MBOMBELA – GRIP helps thousands of survivors of rape and domestic abuse, from young to old, but relies entirely on donated funds and fundraising initiatives.</p>

      <p>According the founder, Barbara Kenyon, their recent move to a different location does not affect the service the organisation renders.</p>
      <blockquote>They are now located in Simunye Building, 49 Anderson Street, opposite Paint Centre.</blockquote>
      <p>“The move follows after the financial constraints the organisation suffered, although we are still rendering the same services to the survivors. We still have teams at police stations, hospitals and courts,” Kenyon said.</p>
      <p>To contact GRIP, you can call 013-752-4404 or the emergency number on 083-310-1321.</p>
