      <h1>More than 1.7 million homes barred from cheap flood cover</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T10:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/sam-barker/" target="_blank">Sam Barker</a></address>
      <p>More than 1.7 million households may be unable to take out affordable flood insurance because they fall outside a state-backed protection scheme.</p>
      <p>Yorkshire and Lincolnshire have been <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/08/severe-flooding-hits-yorkshire-pictures/">hit by severe flooding</a> since last weekend. Some areas are under 10ft of water.</p>
      <p>Flood premiums and excesses have been kept down since April 2016, when insurance firms and the Government <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/insurance/home/i-was-flooded-three-years-ago---can-flood-re-bring-down-the-cost/">set up Flood Re</a>, an “insurer of insurers” that reduces the risk that one firm might face a crippling claims bill.</p>
      <p>But homes built since 2009 are barred from the scheme, regardless of their risk of being swamped, as insurers did not want to encourage building in flood-prone areas. </p>
      <p>The cut-off means that the owners of a house built in 2008 would qualify for lower-cost insurance even if it flooded, while a neighbouring property built in 2009 or after would not. </p>
      <p>There are now 1.4 million homes excluded in England, 173,076 in Scotland, 68,997 in Northern Ireland and 62,457 in Wales, according to official figures.</p>
      <p>The 1.7 million total also does not include leasehold developments with four or more flats, which are not covered by Flood Re regardless of when they were built.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the Association of British Insurers (ABI), a trade body, said: “It’s not that people in these areas won’t be able to get flood cover, but the provisions of Flood Re would not apply.”</p>
      <p>In theory, homes built since 2009 should be at less risk of inundation as tougher rules came in for local authorities considering development in flood-prone areas.</p>
      <p>But in practice, building in these regions continued. In the 2015-16 tax year, 9pc of new homes were constructed in areas at the highest risk of flooding. </p>
      <p>A spokesman for the National Flood Forum, a charity, said: “Consideration of flooding should be at the top of the agenda. But properties that are being built now are still flooding.”</p>
      <p>Flood Re is due to last until 2039, and there are no plans to update the 2009 cut-off date.</p>
      <p>Insurers demanded the 2009 exclusion due to worries developers were increasingly building on flood-prone areas as the best residential land had already been built on.</p>
      <p>Homeowners once struggled to get flood insurance at all, because a claim for a waterlogged home can be up to £45,000, according to the Association of British Insurers. Other homes could only get the cover if they paid high premiums or excesses.</p>
