      <p>A big meeting has now been called as a matter of urgency to find out how it happened.</p>
      <p>Underbelly, who run the Christmas Market, are set to open this year's event on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Thousands of people from all over the world visit the site every year.</p>
      <p>Council Leader Adam McVey said: “I’m extremely disappointed that Underbelly did not apply for the proper consents for Christmas 2018/19 as it was their responsibility to do so under the contract.</p>
      <p>"That said, there are clearly lessons to be learned for our own processes both in terms of contract management and enforcement.</p>
      <p>"I’ve asked the Chief Executive to get to the bottom of this as a matter of urgency with a meeting of all relevant Council departments to examine how this happened and give assurance this won’t happen again.</p>
      <p>"Edinburgh’s Christmas has grown to be a “must go” attraction for tens of thousands of our residents each week as well as huge numbers of visitors so it’s important that we get the organisation of</p>
      <p>this right and this situation does not reoccur.</p>

      <p>“This year’s Edinburgh’s Christmas festivities are getting under way on Saturday, with our Building Standards and Public Safety teams carrying out final inspections and checks of the site before it opens to the public.</p>
      <p>"We’ve also recommended and approved pedestrian-only access on Waverley Bridge from 11am to 5pm on Saturdays and Sundays to make it much easier for everyone to move around in a relaxed, fun and welcoming atmosphere.”</p>
      <p>Final safety checks are being carried out today to ensure all is good to go ahead and open.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>But despite this, the structure of the market this year has been hit by severe safety concerns.</p>
      <p>It's after snap showed a construction of metal poles supporting a platform in East Princes Street Gardens.</p>
      <p>Concerns were raised over the wooden blocks at the base of the structure, which appear unsteady on the sloping grass.</p>
