      <p>A previously unseen interview with the late Buddy Miles has arrived online, and it sees him discussing how he worked with <a href="http://nme.com/artists/jimi-hendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a> to create the now legendary ‘Machine Gun’. Check out the clip exclusively on NME.com.</p>
      <p>Next week (November 22), will see the release of ‘Songs For Groovy Children: The Fillmore East Concerts’, a new box set which captures all four historic concerts by Hendrix at New York’s Fillmore East.</p>
      <p>Joined by Miles on drums and Billy Cox on bass, Hendrix’s now legendary concert at the venue in January 1970 went on to become his ‘Band of Gypsys’ album.</p>

      <p>In the new clip, filmed prior to Miles’ death in 2008, he discusses how the three became the Band of Gypsys.</p>
      <p>“The Band of Gypsys was a strong statement from three brothers, because we all had intimacy and love,” Miles explains in the clip.</p>
      <p>“We also had a feel for what we thought was right and what we enjoyed playing.”</p>
      <p>As for ‘Machine Gun’ itself, he describes how the classic track was inspired by Hendrix’s love of Delta Blues.</p>
      <p>“It was taken from a style called Delta Blues. He had a deep fascination with Muddy Waters too, but that track was most definitely from the Deep South.”</p>

      <p>The new box-set, meanwhile, captures all four of the band’s performances at the Fillmore, across the end of 1969 and the very beginning of 1970.</p>
