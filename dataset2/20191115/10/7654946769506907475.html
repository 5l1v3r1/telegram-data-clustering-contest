      <h1>Brian Cashman details Yankees approach for snaring top pitcher</h1>

      <p>After returning from the general managers’ meetings, Brian Cashman said it was too soon to tell where the Yankees stood in their pursuit of a top-echelon starting pitcher.</p>
      <p>“It’s so early in the process in my conversations with the personnel,’’ Cashman said. “Clearly, the bigger the name — and they’ve earned the right — the bigger the contract, the bigger the expectation, the bigger the money. There’s gonna be opportunities for some people to take advantage of great performances in this marketplace. They’ve earned that right.”</p>
      <p>At the top of that list figure to be <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/13/scott-boras-why-the-yankees-absolutely-need-gerrit-cole/">Gerrit Cole</a> and Stephen Strasburg. Cashman has talked to agent Scott Boras about both pitchers — and their sales pitch won’t be about only money.</p>
      <p>“We’re just gonna put our best foot forward, making sure we can share who we are and what we represent,’’ Cashman said Thursday. “Not just with the contract and the offer. We’ll try to make sure they understand what our culture is — along with a winning contract offer to make sure to try to win the day. Even that doesn’t guarantee anything.”</p>
      <p>The Yankees were outbid a year ago by the Nationals for Patrick Corbin and after they moved on from the Manny Machado sweepstakes, pivoted toward signing players such as DJ LeMahieu, Zack Britton and Adam Ottavino.</p>
      <p>Signing Cole would mean a contract almost certainly well north of $200 million and Cashman has said he wants to upgrade the rotation.</p>
      <p>“We want high-end, quality innings, as deep as we possibly can by as many starters as we can and that’s despite having an exceptional bullpen,’’ Cashman said. “We want to make sure our bullpen remains the strength.”</p>
      <p>And he’s not limiting himself to just the most high-profile targets.</p>
      <p>“Some will be large, highly acclaimed names that are free agents,’’ Cashman said. “Others could be impactful, but might not be as pretty or sexy in terms of name recognition. … The bottom line is we’re gonna look at every opportunity, no matter how big or small in public perception.’’</p>
      <p>One starter who might have been a fit came off the board Thursday, when Jake Odorizzi accepted Minnesota’s qualifying offer instead of becoming a free agent.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Cashman spent <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/yankees-brian-cashman-third-base-gio-urshelas-job-to-lose/">Thursday night at Yankee Stadium</a>, taking part in the Sleep Out to raise money for Covenant House in Manhattan, which provides housing and supportive services to youth facing homelessness. This was the first year the event was held at the Stadium.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Cashman again declined comment about MLB’s investigation of the Astros potentially using cameras to steal signs, even as video emerged of Houston potentially using a whistling sound during this year’s win over the Yankees in the ALCS.</p>
