      <p>On Monday, Sterling was dropped from the England squad after reportedly grabbing Gomez by the throat in an incident that left the Liverpool defender with a scratch beneath his eye.</p>
      <p>The severity of the incident has since been played down by both players, with Sterling accepting his punishment and issuing a public apology, but it has opened discussion into the dynamic of football dressing rooms.</p>
      <p>Reds captain Jordan Henderson has since revealed how he, too, nearly came to blows with former teammate Suarez during their shared time at Liverpool.</p>

      <p>"I was trying to do the best I can do," Henderson said, according to the <i>Daily Mail.</i></p>
      <p>"Being a footballer, there is criticism and people doubting you all the time.</p>
      <p>"At that time, I was a young player and there were one or two things Luis did in training that I didn't like.</p>
      <p>"It made me feel I wasn't good enough to be in the same team in training. His arms were up, like 'what the f***, what is he doing', like I shouldn't be there.</p>
      <p>"That really hurt me. He did it three times, and then I exploded and I was ready to kill him. From that point, I had a good relationship with Luis. The next game I set him up for his goal.</p>
      <p>"He was brilliant with me after that and I was really close to him after that, and he was another big player I learned from."</p>
