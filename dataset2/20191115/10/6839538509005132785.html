      <p>Legionella bacteria has been found during routine testing of the water supply at Armadale Hospital.</p>
      <p>The bacteria can cause Legionnaires’ disease, a potentially fatal form of pneumonia, if it is inhaled from water or soil.</p>
      <p>No patients have contracted Legionnaires’ disease because of the bacteria, which was believed to have been found in rooms of the hospital which are not regularly used.</p>
      <p>An Armadale Hospital spokesperson said there was negligible risk to staff and patients and no cause for alarm.</p>
      <p>“We will continue to monitor this situation, and we have comprehensive processes in place to manage situations such as these,” she said.</p>
      <p>“We will continue to monitor the hospital’s water supply and have undertaken a number of precautions including the flushing of water lines.”</p>
      <p>Routine water supply testing at the hospital is designed to detect bacteria, or any other issues, before it can affect patients or staff.</p>
      <p>The hospital remains fully operational.</p>
      <p>Around 72 cases of Legionnaires’ disease are diagnosed in WA every year. It is treated with antibiotics, and can be fatal if not treated in time.</p>
