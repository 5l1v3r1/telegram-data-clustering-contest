      <p>It’s the work of astrophysicist Raman Prinja and artist Chris Wormell and seeks to portray “galleries of galactic matter”.</p>
      <p>The book was cited for addressing all aspects of space, from the Sun and Solar System to the lives of stars, the Milky Way and beyond.</p>
      <blockquote>“The illustrations in this book are fantastic and they really capture the vast scale of space – you get to see inside Neptune, the life cycle of stars, and learn about exoplanets,” said Chair of the judges, Professor Sheila Rowan FRS.<br/><br/>“The writing is clear, informative, and a pleasure to read, with descriptions that draw you in. I can really imagine Planetarium inspiring young people about the wonders of the universe.”</blockquote>
      <h3>Authors</h3>
      <p>Raman Prinja is Professor of Astrophysics at University College London and he specialises in massive stars, star formation and the evolution of galaxies.</p>
      <blockquote>He is a multiple winner of UCL faculty and department teaching awards and is keen to bring the subject of astronomy to a wider audience. He has written several successful books on the subject, including Night Sky Watcher which was shortlisted for the Royal Society Young People’s Book Prize in 2015.</blockquote>
      <p>Note that a Junior version of the book is also available for £10.99 (aimed at a younger age group of around age 8 upwards). It is an abridged version of the original and smaller in size, the publishers tell us.</p>
      <h3>Shortlist</h3>
      <p>The Royal Society reports that more than 10,000 young people from 471 UK schools and youth groups selected Planetarium as their favourite science book. It was chosen from a shortlist of six titles, which had been put forward by a panel of adult judges, chaired by Royal Society Fellow Professor Sheila Rowan. The famous author Michael Rosen was part of the panel.</p>
