      <h2>The new Friends range at supermarket Aldi is an absolute must for fans of the iconic 90s sitcom</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T10:02:47+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 10:02</time> by <a rel="author">Melisha Kaur, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/melisha-kaur/</a></address>
      <p>After launching 25 years ago in the 90s, American TV sitcom <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/friends">Friends</a> is still popular as ever.</p>
      <p>Now <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/aldi">Aldi</a> is treating devoted fans to its first ever Friends collection and it includes heaps of products inspired by the iconic show - just in time for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> .</p>
      <p>The supermarket giant is set to launch Friends-themed pyjamas (£8.99) as well as homeware items from Thursday, November 21st.</p>
      <p>Friends lovers will be able to create the cosy vibes of the show's famous Central Perk hangout with a range of cushions (£5.99) and coffee mugs.</p>

      <p>There's even a range of duvet sets for your bedroom - including designs that feature iconic moments from the show.</p>
      <p>With prices starting from just £4.99, the wonderfully-themed collection is a must for any Friends fan.</p>
      <p>But items are expected to sell out quickly, so you ought to head over to Aldi as soon as they launch.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile <a href="https://fave.co/357H1K2">New Look</a> is selling an entire Friends range that includes homware, clothing and stationary.</p>
