      <h1>Xiaomi may be working on a RAZR-like clamshell foldable phone, and it might look like this</h1>

      <p>Xiaomi may be working a foldable flip phone, the design of which likely to be similar to the recently-released <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/motorola-razr-officially-announced-will-be-available-for-1500-from-verizon/">Motorola RAZR foldable phone</a>.</p>
      <p>According to the patent images that have appeared on CNIPA (China National Intellectual Property Administration), Xiaomi’s foldable phone is going to have a clamshell design, like the RAZR phone.</p>
      <p>However, there will be noticeable differences: when closed, you’ll see a rectangular screen at the front and at the back, you’ll have a dual-camera setup. If you want to take selfies, you’ll have to unfold the device as the selfie camera is going to be located on the upper bezel in the interior. In this regard, Xiaomi’s upcoming foldable clamshell smartphone is quite different from what Motorola offers.</p>

      <p>Although Xiaomi is yet to make its first foldable phone, the Chinese firm seems to be very ambitious about foldable smartphones, like all the major smartphone manufacturers. The company <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/xiaomis-upcoming-folding-phone-leaked-online-again/">posted a 10-second teaser in early 2019, giving us a few glimpses of what its foldable smartphone might look like</a>. The device folds inwards from both the left and right side, producing a compact sandwich which passably resembles a phone, especially with the power button on top.</p>
      <p>Needless to say, what we saw back in early 2019 is different from what we’re seeing in the latest patent.</p>
      <p>Aside from Xiaomi, <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/samsung-teases-clamshell-folding-galaxy-fold-2-at-sdc-2019/">Samsung too, is also working on a foldable clamshell smartphone</a> and as per sources, it is going to launch the device at Mobile World Congress 2020.</p>
      <p>It’s also worth noting that patents don’t always translate to a real product, and we might also see the same happening to this Xiaomi patent.</p>
