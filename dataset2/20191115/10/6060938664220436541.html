      <p>The festive season and pollution can take a toll on your skin. As the wedding season is approaching, brides-to-be must take care of their skin to get the glow back. Flaunt that natural glow without the use of make-up. To get that shine, try these three beauty tips for a clean, glowing complexion.</p>
      <p><b>BORROW INGREDIENTS FROM THE KITCHEN PANTRY<br/></b>To start with, use a mixture of besan powder, turmeric and sandalwood powder, and apply it on your face. Let this application stay on your face for at least 15 minutes. Then wash it off for a natural glow. You can also opt for a mix of rose water and besan powder, which also has the same effect.</p>
      <p>
        <b>CLEANSE YOUR PORES WITH A CHARCOAL MASK</b>
      </p>
      <p>If you are looking for a deep cleanse, opt for a charcoal mask. It will suck impurities, clean your face and give it a natural sheen.</p>
      <p>
        <b>HYDRATE WITH A FACIAL SHEET</b>
      </p>
      <p>Depending on your skin type, pick a facial sheet, which will hydrate your skin and replenish the necessary oils that your skin needs. This will also give your skin some much-needed moisture.</p>
