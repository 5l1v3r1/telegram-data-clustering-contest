      <h1>Plymouth Argyle boss Ryan Lowe on FA Cup scouting mission as analyst for BT Sport broadcast</h1>
      <h2>The winners of the televised replay between Bromley and Bristol Rovers will host the Pilgrims in round two</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T10:46:35+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 10:46</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Errington</a></address>
      <p>Ryan Lowe will be a TV analyst for the FA Cup replay which will decide Plymouth Argyle’s second round opponents.</p>
      <p>Graham Coughlan’s Bristol Rovers have to travel to National League leaders Bromley next Tuesday in a match which will be televised live by BT Sport.</p>
      <p>The winners of the replay on the 3G pitch at Bromley’s Hayes Lane ground <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/plymouth-argyle">will host Argyle on the weekend of November 30-December 1</a>.</p>
      <p>Bromley scored a late equaliser when they drew 1-1 away to League One outfit Rovers on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Lowe will now get the chance to get a proper look at both sides at the invitation of BT Sport in preparation for Argyle’s second round tie.</p>
      <p>He said: “Bromley are going well in the National League and Graham is doing a good job at Bristol Rovers.</p>
      <p>“Listen, we know it’s going to be tough but to get through to the third round has never been easy.</p>
      <p>“People say ‘You want a lower-league team at home’ but sometimes that’s a scalp isn’t it?</p>
      <p>“I will be down there doing the game at Bromley for BT Sport. I will get a good insight and a good watch of it.</p>
      <p>“Whoever it is, it is. When that game comes around we will have to pit our wits against whoever it is.”</p>
      <p>Lowe is used to appearing as a TV analyst. He did so for Sky Sports in their coverage of the League Two play-offs last season.</p>
      <p>Then, last month, he was the studio guest for the midweek EFL highlights round-up on Quest with host Colin Murray.</p>
