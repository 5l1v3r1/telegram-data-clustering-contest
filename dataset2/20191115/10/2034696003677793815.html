        <b>The iconic band will return to London in 2020</b>
      </p>
      <p>Today, on the 25 anniversary of the release of ‘CrazySexyCool,’ <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/TLC">TLC</a> have announced that they will be returning to London in 2020.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>TLC will play at the O2 Shepherds Bush Empire on June 29, 202o in what is being billed as “an incredible, non-stop party with hit after hit all night long.” Tickets for the gig will go on sale at 10am on November 20 and you can buy them <a href="http://www.LiveNation.co.uk/">here</a>.</p>
      <p>The performance is also said to celebrate the twenty-year milestone of TLC’s debut ‘FanMail’ headline tour.</p>
      <p>TLC, who are made up of Tionne “T-Boz” Watkins, Rozonda “Chilli” Thomas, have sold over 70 million records in their career and had huge hits with songs such as ‘Waterfalls’, ‘Creep’, ‘No Scrubs’ and ‘Unpretty’.</p>
      <p>Their third member, Lisa “Left Eye” Lopes, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/lisa-lopes-left-eye-7-1381176">passed away in a car crash in 2002,</a> shortly after TLC had finished recording their fourth album.</p>

      <p>TLC are returning to London next year</p>
      <p>In 2017, the group returned with their first album in fifteen years. <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/tlc-tlc#d2AUvoSVFZpv1uw8.99">Reviewing the album</a>, NME said: “This album also feels more purposeful than the average reunion effort because it was crowdfunded by fans…The Earth, Wind &amp; Fire-sampling ‘It’s Sunny’ is too cheesy, and ‘Aye Muthaf***a’ slips in some <a href="http://nme.com/artists/rihanna">Rihanna</a>-style dancehall beats, but elsewhere ‘TLC’ offers a familiar mix of breezy R&amp;B tunes and folky self-acceptance jams. “<i>Either you’re too young to matter or you’re way too old / Public opinion is so hot and cold</i>,” they sing poignantly on standout ‘Haters’.</p>
      <p>“When TLC sing, “<i>Thank you for being by my side / Hope you all enjoy the ride</i>,” on ‘Joy Ride’, a song aimed at fans, it’s hard not to feel a little emotional.”</p>
      <p>Back in April, <a href="http://nme.com/artists/weezer">Weezer</a> covered TLC’s ‘No Scrubs’ with the R&amp;B group’s own Chilli during their <a href="http://nme.com/tag/coachella">Coachella 2019</a> set.</p>
      <p>The Rivers Cuomo-led band performed on the Main Stage just before <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/live/tame-impalas-coachella-headline-set-huge-moment-band-instead-feels-like-wasted-opportunity">Tame Impala headlined the second day of the festival</a>.</p>
      <p>During their set, Weezer revisited two songs they covered on their recent ‘Teal Album’. First, they were joined by Tears For Fears to run through a version of their 1985 single ‘Everybody Wants To Rule The World’, before moving onto the TLC track a few songs later.</p>
      <p>As the song started, Cuomo told the audience to “give it up”, before going on to swap vocals with Chilli on a rocky version of the hit track. </p>
