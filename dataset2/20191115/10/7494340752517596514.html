      <h1>Most Americans Think They're Being Constantly Tracked, Study Finds</h1>

      <p>An anonymous reader quotes a report from MIT Technology Review: <i>More than 60% of Americans think it's impossible to go through daily life without being tracked by companies or the government, according to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/11/15/americans-and-privacy-concerned-confused-and-feeling-lack-of-control-over-their-personal-information/">a new Pew Research study</a>. It's not just that Americans (correctly) think companies are collecting their data. They don't like it. About 69% of Americans <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/f/614720/privacy-pew-research-data-collection-big-tech-facebook-google-apple/">are skeptical that companies will use their private information in a way they're comfortable with</a>, while 79% don't believe that companies will come clean if they misuse the information. When it comes to who they trust, there are differences by race. About 73% of black Americans, for instance, are at least a little worried about what law enforcement knows about them, compared with 56% of white Americans. But among all respondents, more than 80% were concerned about what social-media sites and advertisers might know. Despite these concerns, more than 80% of Americans feel they have no control over how their information is collected.</i></p>
