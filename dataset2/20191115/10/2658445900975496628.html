      <h1>Family found dead at Istanbul apartment - The Nation Newspaper</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T10:27:41+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 10:27</time> by <a rel="author">https://www.facebook.com/Cheerfulpraise</a></address>
      <p>The police in Istanbul on Friday discovered the bodies of two parents and their 6-year-old child inside an apartment in a suspected case of murder-suicide by cyanide, authorities said.</p>
      <p>Bulent Kerimoglu, the mayor of Istanbul’s Bakirkoy neighbourhood said, “It appears that the father poisoned the family with cyanide.</p>
      <p>“He was suffering from a severe economic crisis, trapped in serious debt since a very long time.”</p>
      <p>Kerimoglu added that forensic experts were investigating the exact cause of the deaths.</p>
      <p>The father, a jewellery dealer in Istanbul’s Bakirkoy district, was suffering from “depression” due to “an excessive amount of debt following some informal online business transactions,” the Istanbul chief public prosecutor’s office said.</p>
      <p>This is the third case of suicide since last week over alleged financial difficulties.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, a family of four, including parents and two children, were killed in cyanide poisoning in Antalya.</p>
      <p>The father had left behind a note explaining that he had been having financial problems.</p>
      <p>On Nov. 6, two sisters and two brothers were found dead in their Istanbul apartment after cyanide poisoning.</p>

      <p>The siblings suffered from financial problems.</p>
      <p>Turkey has an ailing economy, high public indebtedness and jobless rates, among other issues.</p>
      <p>Nearly 1 million people lost their jobs between August this year and the same month of 2018, the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat) said on Friday.</p>
      <p>More than 70 per cent of the population had outstanding debts in 2018, according to TurkStat.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, Turkey’s media watchdog, RTUK, warned broadcasters against encouraging suicides, criticising some reports of “normalising” and “dramatising” such cases.</p>
      <p>The watchdog vowed measures against content including “violence”.</p>
