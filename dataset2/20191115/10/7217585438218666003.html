      <p>Google Maps will now feature a translation tool to help users navigate in foreign countries.</p>
      <p>“Simply tap the new speaker button next to the place name or address, and Google Maps will say it out loud, making your next trip that much simpler,” the company explained on its <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/maps/speak-easy-while-traveling/">website</a>.</p>
      <p>The feature will allow Maps users to learn the names of new places and better communicate with locals.</p>
      <p>“And when you want to have a deeper conversation, Google Maps will quickly link you to the Google Translate app,” Google further noted.</p>
      <p>According to the company, Maps and Translate will work together to automatically detect the preferred language for translation.</p>
      <p>The in-app translation feature, with support for 50 languages, will roll out on Maps for both iOS and Android this month.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, the app also received new <a href="https://memeburn.com/2019/11/google-maps-profile-edit/">public profile management tools</a> for users.</p>
