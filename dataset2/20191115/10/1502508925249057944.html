      <p>Consumer spending fell for the first time in more than four decades in 2017-18, primarily driven by slackening <b><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/consumer-spend-sees-first-fall-in-4-decades-on-weak-rural-demand-nso-data-119111401975_1.html">rural demand</a></b>, according to the latest consumption expenditure survey by the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/current-affairs-news-national-1150106.htm">National </a>Statistical Office (NSO). The survey — Key Indicators: Household Consumer Expenditure in India — shows the average amount of money spent by a person in a month fell by 3.7 per cent to Rs 1,446 in 2017-18 from Rs 1,501 in 2011-12.

        <b>Vodafone pleads for govt relief after posting worst quarterly loss in India</b>
      </p>
      <p>After posting the worst quarterly loss in India’s corporate history, <a href="https://mybs.in/2XAg7xA"><b>Vodafone Group</b></a> Plc’s besieged local venture is appealing for urgent relief from the government to help avert a collapse. <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/vodafone-idea">Vodafone Idea </a>Ltd took a one-time charge related to a $4 billion demand from the government towards overdue fees, leading to a net loss of Rs 50,900 crore ($7.1 billion) in the three months through September. Saddled with $14 billion of net debt, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/vodafone-idea">Vodafone Idea </a>is fighting for survival after India’s top court last month ordered it to pay fees the government said were due from prior years.</p>

      </p>
      <p>A day after posting the worst quarterly loss in India’s corporate history, Vodafone Idea's CEO Ravinder Takkar said the Supreme Court judgment on Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) would have significant implications on the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/telecom">telecom </a>industry and that the company was in the process of filing a review petition. He also asserted that the government was aware of the tremendous stress faced by operators and was determined to see <a href="https://mybs.in/2XAg80n"><b>three private players</b></a> and one public player in the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/telecom">telecom </a>sector.</p>

        <b>Delaying zero IUC regime will hurt affordability of telecom services: Jio</b>
      </p>
      <p>Reliance Jio today said that delaying the implementation of <a href="https://mybs.in/2XAg7xN"><b>zero call connect charges</b></a> beyond January 2020 will hurt affordability of telecom services in a sector where users have benefited from free voice calls. Reliance Jio Director Mahendra Nahata said that the ratio of incoming and outgoing call is now at par with each other and traffic asymmetry can, therefore, no longer be the reason to delay implementation of Bill and Keep (BAK) regime (that is zero mobile termination charge from January 1, 2020).</p>

        <b>SC ruling on <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/singh-brothers">Singh brothers </a>halts IHH Healthcare's Fortis takeover plan</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Supreme Court refused to lift the block on completion of the takeover of embattled hospital chain Fortis Healthcare by Malaysian operator IHH Healthcare Bhd. The court held Fortis’ founders -- Malvinder Singh and Shivinder Singh -- guilty of contempt of court and said it could start similar proceedings against the company, according to today's judgment. This effectively <a href="https://mybs.in/2XAg7uF"><b>halts IHH’s open offer to Fortis shareholders</b></a> that would have brought its holdings in India’s second largest hospital company above 50%. IHH is already Fortis’ largest shareholder with a 31% stake.</p>
