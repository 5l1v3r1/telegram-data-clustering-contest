      <p>MotoGP rider Michele Pirro had a fiery moment in practice ahead of the final race of the season as his bike burst into flames.</p>
      <p>Pirro was out on track going around a left handed corner when he slowed up noticing something was not right with his bike.</p>
      <p>But he initially seemed unaware of the violent flames beneath him as an inferno started near the back wheel.</p>
      <p>He eventually took a look down and appeared to do a double take before ditching the bike quickly in the gravel trap.</p>
      <p>Marshals swooped in with fire extinguishers to put out the blaze as Pirro walked back to the paddock unharmed by the alarming incident.</p>

      <p>The experienced Italian, 33, is a test rider for Ducati and unlikely to appear in Sunday's final race of the season.</p>
      <p>He takes part in practice sessions as the team work on the bike which is ridden by main team riders Andrea Dovizioso and Danilo Petrucci.</p>
      <p>Pirro did race in Italy, finishing seventh in his home Grand Prix, and retired in his second race of the year in San Marino.</p>

      <p>Fabio Quartararo clocked the fastest time in free practice one, ahead of Jack Miller and world champion Marc Marquez.</p>
      <p>Pirro clocked the 13th quickest time despite his fiery exit, just ahead of British ace Cal Crutchlow.</p>
      <p>Former Ducati rider Jorge Lorenzo announced his retirement yesterday, meaning the race in Spain will be his last in the sport.</p>

      <p>"I love this sport but above all I love winning," Lorenzo said at a special news conference also attended by series CEO Carmelo Ezpeleta.</p>
      <p>"I have let myself down and I have let down Honda but I think this is the best decision for me and the team. We are both winners and we always have to fight to win."</p>
