      <p>Cape Town - This year <i>Empire</i> actress Taraji P Henson has been very vocal about her <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/Gossip/News/taraji-p-henson-opens-up-about-her-battle-with-depression-and-anxiety-20190403"><b>battle with depression and anxiety</b></a> and now she has shared how she tries to get a handle on it.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.bet.com/style/living/2019/11/13/taraji-p--henson-exclusive.html"><b>BET</b></a> at a Kinder Bueno pop-up in New York recently, the 49-year-old actress opened up about her relationship with fiancé Kelvin Hayden, her holiday plans, as well as how she deals with depression.</p>
      <p>"When I have moments when I feel the darkness creeping in, that's what I like to call it, I have friends that I can call on that, that'll pull me out of it. Sometimes I'll find it hard to motivate myself to work out. I have a friend I can call that will come make me get up and go work out. I meditate. I am into aroma therapy. I’m into sound therapy. So I play Tibetan music singing bowls and that helps a lot," she told the publication.</p>

      <p>Although the actress says her friends pull her out of the dark place she sometimes finds herself in, she says having a therapist is also important as friends can be biased.</p>
      <p>"You just have to find what works for you. You know, you should absolutely seek a therapist. Your friends are not your therapists. They are very biased, and they have stakes involved in you. So sometimes their opinion can be skewed a bit. So that's why it's important to seek a professional, someone who studies human behavior and the human mind,” she said.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://variety.com/2019/tv/features/taraji-p-henson-depression-pay-inequality-empire-1203178582/"><b>Variety</b> </a>earlier this year, the actress revealed that she visits her therapist regularly but had to keep changing therapists before finding the right one.</p>
      <p>"Going and talking to all these different therapists, that’s a craft. You’ve got to keep going until you find the right one. It’s like a relationship. I’ve got to feel comfortable because that’s the only way I’m going to keep coming back to you. To keep dealing with this ugly stuff, I have to feel totally safe," she explained.</p>
