      <h1>Heavy snow leaves one dead, 300,000 homes without power in France</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T10:37:29+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 10:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/76/afp/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p><b>PARIS: </b>Heavy snowfall across a large swath of southeast France has left one person dead and cut power to some 300,000 homes, with icy conditions snarling train and road traffic Friday.</p>
      <p>A 63-year-old man was killed Thursday evening in the Isere department after a snow-laden tree fell on him while he was trying to clear away another downed tree, local officials said.</p>
      <p>Grid operator Enedis said 300,000 homes were without electricity Friday, mainly in the Drome, Ardeche, Isere and Rhone departments, which include the cities of Lyon and Grenoble, a spokesperson told BFM television.</p>
      <p>“It’s an exceptional situation because the snow is heavily concentrated in a single area, which is why we have significant damage to our power lines,” said the spokesperson, Robin Devogelaere.</p>
      <p>“We’ve had trees knocked down, and branches weighed down with snow have frozen and caused short-circuits,” he said, adding that treacherous roads were making it hard for teams to reach and fix the cables.</p>

      <p>Up to 30 centimetres (one foot) of snow had fallen at higher elevations near the Alps in less than 24 hours, and 15 centimetres was reported at the Lyon airport.</p>
      <p>The Meteo France weather agency had lifted travel warnings for much of the area by Friday morning, though maintained alerts for snow and black ice in the Saone-et-Loire department.</p>
      <p>Train operator SNCF said trees and branches falling on tracks had forced service halts on three main lines near Lyon and Grenoble until at least Friday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Several trains had to be evacuated overnight, with passengers transferred to other lines or housed in hotels.</p>
      <p>Authorities had halted truck traffic Thursday to avoid pileups on heavily used routes, though the restrictions were expected to be lifted later Friday.</p>
      <p>But school bus services remained cut in several areas.</p>
