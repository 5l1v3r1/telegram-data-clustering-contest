      <p>Colin Furze is a British inventor who runs a popular YouTube channel where he makes all kinds of crazy and dangerous looking inventions. Previously, he designed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSous9YunIc">some of the trick weapons from Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a>, and now he's turned his attention to Overwatch.</p>
      <p>Using chainsaws, spikes, remote control devices and motor bike parts, Furze has managed to create a working version of Junkrat's RIP-Tire in real life. Take a look at his video below to see how he made it, and watch some of the carnage it can create.</p>

      <p>It may not explode at the end, but Furze does manage to destroy a fence and smash through some glass panes with his home-made RIP-Tire. It also picks up a fair amount of speed, perfect for chasing down those pesky supports. Junkrat would be proud.</p>
      <p>The inventor isn't done with this ultimate project yet, however. The next video he hopes to make the RIP-Tire even more destructive - maybe we'll finally see some explosions.</p>
      <p>Overwatch is available on PC, PS4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-05-everything-we-learned-about-overwatch-2-at-this-years-blizzcon">Overwatch 2 on its way in the future</a>.</p>
