      <h1>(Video) Ox’s Liverpool showreel proves he can be lethal if given a chance</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T10:20:47+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 10:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/steven-carson/" target="_blank">Ste Carson</a></address>
      <p>Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is currently in the form of his life, as he netted for England last night which takes his tally for the season to five already.</p>
      <p>Considering we’re in November, and that this is his best goal-scoring season since joining the Reds, that’s very impressive.</p>
      <p>The Ox can hit one – oh, he can hit one – and a compilation created by Streamable user Luke Galea really showcases his ability to find the back of the net.</p>
      <p>
