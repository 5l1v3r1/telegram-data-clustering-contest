      <p><i>Fortnite</i> has once again paired up with one of the biggest media properties on earth for a cool new cosmetic. You can dress up as a stormtrooper now, and there are two ways to do it. One, you can simply purchase the skin from the item shop. Or two, you can buy <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/11/15/20965341/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc"><i>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</i></a>.</p>
      <p>More specifically, you can buy<i> Jedi: Fallen Order</i> on the Epic Games Store to unlock the iconic suit in <i>Fortnite</i>. It’s not a bad deal when you consider that the latest Star Wars game is actually pretty good. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/11/15/20965341/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc">Our review of <i>Jedi: Fallen Order</i></a> states that it is a single-player exploration game that shakes up what we typically expect from Star Wars titles. There are some flaws, but on the whole, the Respawn-developed game is an enjoyable experience that manages to have actual stakes, despite being a prequel to the most recent movies.</p>

      <p>This collaboration shouldn’t come as a shock — previously, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/8/17332600/fortnite-thanos-infinity-gauntlet-is-the-best"><i>Fortnite</i> teamed up with Marvel for some skins and new modes</a>. Disney, of course, owns both Marvel and Star Wars, and if <i>Fortnite</i> is family-friendly enough for one, it’s good for both. Epic Games has made a very good play for getting people to download the Epic Games Store.</p>
      <p><b>Correction: </b>A previous version of this article stated that you had to buy <i>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</i> to unlock the Imperial Stormtrooper skin in <i>Fortnite</i>. However, you can also just purchase the skin separately.</p>
