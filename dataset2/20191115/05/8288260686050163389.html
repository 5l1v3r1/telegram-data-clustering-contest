      <p>Widely referred to as the <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/birmingham-german-market-2019-dates-15661266">German market</a>, Birmingham's annual extravaganza was first brought here by the organiser of Frankfurt's own festive market in 1997. It had just 10 stalls in its first year.</p>
      <p>It was such a success that it became an annual event, returning in 2001 and coming back every year since then. There are now dozens of stalls sprawling through the city centre.</p>
      <p>This is now the the largest outdoor Christmas market in the UK, and the biggest German market outside Germany and Austria.</p>
      <p>Weekends tend to be the busiest times especially Friday and Saturday evenings and Sunday afternoons - great if you enjoy a bustling atmosphere but it can get very crowded.</p>
      <p>Weekdays are less hectic though it can get very busy in the middle of the day (from noon to 2pm when shop and office workers go there in their lunch break).</p>
      <p>It experiences a second busy spell after 5pm on weekday evenings, up until about 7.30pm, as people stop for a drink and a bite to eat on their way home from work in the city centre.</p>
      <p>Visitors will find a large range of traditional goods and gifts, such as handcrafted decorations, toys, jewellery and more. There's also a selection of tempting food and drink. Pretzels, schnitzels, bratwursts, and roasted almonds can be washed down with glühwein, weissbeer or hot chocolate.</p>
      <p>The huge Christmas trees also make an impessive festive backdrop.</p>
      <p>The market will run until  December 23, 2019.</p>
