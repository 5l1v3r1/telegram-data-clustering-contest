      <p>A new petrol station in Gippsland opened today, and they’re offering an unbeatable deal to celebrate.</p>
      <p>Peter tipped 3AW’s Tom Elliott off to the bargain at a Pakenham service station.</p>
      <p>Caltex Pakenham is celebrating its grand opening by selling both petrol and diesel for just 99.9 cents per litre.</p>
      <p>The deal was meant to end at 3pm, but appears to have been extended.</p>
      <p>If you want to snag a bargain you’ll have to wait, though, queues at the service station are huge!</p>
      <p>It comes as petrol prices surge to as high as $1.75 a litre in some parts of the city.</p>
      <p>The service station is also offering free coffee.</p>
      <p>What a bargain!</p>
