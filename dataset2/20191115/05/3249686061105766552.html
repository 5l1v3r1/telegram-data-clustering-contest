      <blockquote>Hello.<br/>This is Cre.ker Entertainment.This is a notice regarding The Boyz member Younghoon.Younghoon fell while walking up stairs and injured his collarbone. He received a thorough examination at the hospital, and the doctor suggested that he should rest for two to three weeks.Following the doctor’s suggestion, he will be temporarily unable to participate in scheduled activities for a fast recovery and treatment.
