      <p>Three women drowned in a flash flood as they tried to rescue dogs from an inundated animal shelter in central Slovakia, the prime minister said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The women had responded to an emergency appeal issued on Wednesday in the town of Revuca after heavy rain caused a river to burst its banks.</p>
      <p>Identified by local media only as Zuzana, Katka and Zdenka, all three worked at another animal shelter in the nearby town of Roznava, 300km east of the capital Bratislava.</p>
      <p>The women managed to load the dogs into their vehicle but were swept away by floodwaters on the return journey.</p>
      <p>"The information is confirmed, all three women died," Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini told journalists in Bratislava.</p>
      <p>Emergency services spokesperson Erik Piater told the TASR newswire that rescuers had recovered the remains of one woman and were still searching for the other bodies.</p>
      <p>Tragedy also struck in western Slovakia on Wednesday as 12 people were killed, including four students, when a public bus carrying school children collided with a truck loaded with rocks and soil.</p>
      <p>The Slovak government has declared Friday a national day of mourning.</p>
