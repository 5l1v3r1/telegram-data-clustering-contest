      <p>BEIRUT, LEBANON (7:40 A.M.) – The Syrian Arab Army (SAA) on Thursday completed its deployment along the Syrian-Turkish border after they reached the Al-Malikiyah District in  the Al-Hasakah Governorate.</p>
      <p>The Syrian Army completed its planned deployment once their troops reached the last point in the Al-Malikiyah District, which is located in the town of ‘Ayn Dewar near the Turkish border.</p>
      <p>As a result of this deployment, the Syrian Arab Army finds themselves overseeing the Rmeilan Oil Fields near the Al-Younsiyah Crossing.</p>
      <p>However, while they are positioned near the Rmeilan Oil Fields, they do not have control of this site because the U.S. Armed Forces are currently deployed in this area.</p>
      <p>The Al-Malikiyah District in northeastern Al-Hasakah is considered one of the most important oil rich areas as it contains a large number of oil and gas wells within the governorate.</p>
      <p>Prior to the Syrian Army’s deployment, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) were in control of this oil rich region for seven years.</p>
      <p>The oil pipelines linking the Al-Hasakah Governorate with the Homs and Banias oil refineries have been recently subjected to sabotage operations that have led to the interruption of oil supplies to Syria.</p>
