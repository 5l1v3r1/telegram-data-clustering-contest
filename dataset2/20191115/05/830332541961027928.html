      <p>PORTLAND, Ore. - The time has come to finally say goodbye to a Concourse A at the Portland International Airport.</p>
      <p>Airport officials say they plan to demolish Concourse A to make room for an expansion of Concourse B, which will feature new art and restaurants.</p>
      <p>"That would be a nice feature because people sit around for quite a long time. That would be a nice thing to add to the airport" said traveler Teresa Larson. "Actually, I think Portland is one of the prettier airports."</p>
      <p>The plan to close and demolish Concourse A was mostly met with excitement, as Portland travelers realized it wasn't the prettiest part of the airport.</p>
      <p>"It seems about time. It's run its course," said Clay Roscoe.</p>
      <p>Roscoe knows Concourse A very well.</p>
      <p>"I've probably traveled it now for 20 to 25 years," Roscoe said.</p>
      <p>Concourse A is known for its dim lights, low ceilings, and crowded seating area. It was built in 1988 and was meant to be temporary.</p>
      <p>Airport officials say it's bittersweet because there are a lot of memories in the "stuffy, old" concourse - from a surprise wedding proposal to a strip of the famous PDX carpet.</p>
      <p>Airport officials are encouraging people to share their Concourse A memories on social media using #GoodbyeA.</p>
