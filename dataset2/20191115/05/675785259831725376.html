      <h1>UK weather forecast: Flood hit Britain faces more rain as big freeze descends</h1>
      <h2>A Met Office weather warning for ice has been issued in Northern Ireland, with showers of rain and sleet expected this morning</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T05:45:32+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 05:45</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Dresch, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matthew-dresch/</a></address>
      <p>Some 145 flood warnings and a Met Office ice alert are in force as the UK is hit by a big freeze.</p>
      <p>The ice warning in Northern Ireland has been in force since 10.02pm last night - and is due to end at 10am today.</p>
      <p>The alert warns of icy roads as a result of sub-zero temperatures, with further rain and sheet showers expected today.</p>
      <p>Downpours have caused flooding chaos across the country overnight, resulting in landslides, road closures and railway disruption.</p>
      <p>In addition to the 145 flood warnings, the Environment Agency has also issued 172 less serious flood alerts for England.</p>
      <p>Today's <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/met-office">Met Office</a> ice alert states: "Icy stretches are likely to develop on roads and pavements overnight as temperatures fall below zero and this may persist into the morning travel period.</p>
