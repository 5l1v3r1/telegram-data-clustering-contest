The Verge reports: <i>The switches on the 16-inch MacBook Pro are so similar to the standalone keyboard, in fact, that iFixit's report says that keys are interchangeable between the two products. The change comes after a long, <a href="https://apple.slashdot.org/story/18/05/13/098255/class-action-suit-filed-against-apple-over-the-keyboards-in-macbook-pro-and-macbook-laptops">multiyear debate between Apple and customers</a> over the butterfly switches, causing Apple to <a href="https://apple.slashdot.org/story/19/03/27/1551248/apple-still-hasnt-fixed-its-macbook-keyboard-problem">revamp the mechanism multiple times</a> to block debris and add extra strength. Apple was also forced to acknowledge that the keyboards were problematic, and <a href="https://apple.slashdot.org/story/19/05/21/1715242/apple-tweaks-its-troubled-macbook-keyboard-design-yet-again-expands-repair-program">offered an extended warranty program</a> for those laptops. Per iFixit, the new keys also have more travel when you press them (about 0.5 mm more), and the keycaps themselves are about 0.2 mm thicker compared to the much-maligned butterfly switches. The teardown also notes that the clips that attach the keycaps to the switches appear to be more reinforced to make it easier to remove or replace them down the line.</i></p>
