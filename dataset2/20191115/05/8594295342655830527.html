      <p>Your humble editor made a beeline for In N’ Out Burger upon landing at LAX, as Midwesterners are wont to do, and while I munched on my meal, I discovered via the Twitterverse that the details of the <a href="https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2019/11/fords-ev-has-a-name-and-its-the-mustang-mach-e/">Ford Mustang Mach E</a>, which I am about to see up close tomorrow, were leaked. Spoiled, like a Hollywood movie on Reddit.</p>
      <p>Ford flew media out to the Los Angeles Auto Show early so that we could spend time with the Mach E, all for some enterprising forum user to leak the info before showtime.</p>
      <p>To be fair, the specs could be inaccurate, or could change. But here’s what hit the Web earlier tonight, thanks to the <a href="https://www.macheclub.com/threads/ford-website-leak.105/#post-311">Mach E Forum</a>.</p>
      <p>There are five trim levels: Select ($43,895), Premium ($50,600), California Route 1 ($52,400), First Edition (limited edition, $59,900), and GT ($60,500). Those prices don’t include destination or the federal EV tax credit of $7,500.</p>
      <p>Buyers will be able to get rear- or all-wheel drive, and the GT is slated to run 0-60 in the mid-three-second range.</p>
      <p>First Editions should have a range of 270 miles, while the GT and Select will be around 230, with the rest being around 300.</p>
      <p>Other nuggets include the ability to add 47 miles of range in 10 minutes of charge time and two large interior digital displays, including a center-stack tablet that looks much like what Tesla offers.</p>
      <p>Ford’s CoPilot360 2.0 and CoPilot360 Assist 2.0 driver-aid systems appear to be standard.</p>
      <p>Check back with us throughout the weekend for more information on Ford’s newest Mustang.</p>
