      <p><a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/plywood/">Plywood</a> panels and fabric curtains have been used by by <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/kooo-architects/">Kooo Architects</a> to transform an existing <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/concrete/">concrete</a> structure into a <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/guesthouses/">guesthouse</a> in <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/Guangzhou/">Guangzhou</a>, China.</p>
      <p>The exterior has been clad with clad with grey and black <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/bricks/">bricks</a>, which were reclaimed from the building that originally stood on the site.</p>

      <p>High parapets incorporate screens of perforated brickwork, referencing similar features found in the surrounding architecture.</p>
      <p>The guesthouse is the second guesthouse Tokyo-based <a href="http://ko-oo.jp/">Kooo Architects</a> has completed in the city for hotel chain Far &amp; Near.</p>
      <p>The first, a <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2019/09/25/hotel-farnear-nanhao-st-guesthouse-kooo-architects-guangzhou-china/">hotel on Nanaho St</a>, involved a similarly light-touch retrofit of a rough concrete structure.</p>

      <p>Four storeys in height, the interior of the existing structure was stripped back and reconfigured to provide 11 guest rooms.</p>
      <p>There is also a common area for guests, which can be isolated from the adjacent corridor by drawing a large curtain.</p>

      <p>Rather than conceal any of the existing structure, the rooms are framed by the large concrete beams and columns.</p>
      <p>This concrete has also been left exposed on the floor in the entrance hallways, stairs and some small areas of the ceiling.</p>

      <p>"Aiming to preserve the beauty of these existing concrete structures, we chose to expose them as part of the interior design," said the studio.</p>

      <p>"We designed this way both to preserve the nature and the particular aesthetic of the original architecture, at the same time satisfying the low budget."</p>

      <p>Meranti plywood panels have been used to create a datum lining the common areas.</p>
      <p>In the bedrooms, a paler basswood ply has been used to cover walls, floors and ceilings, as well as creating built-in shelves and benches.</p>

      <p>Slight alterations to the position and size of openings on the elevations were made to allow more light into the new rooms and improve the facade's visual proportions.</p>
      <p>While some rooms have only small openings looking out to the street, others have full-height glazed walls.</p>

      <p>Window frames are concealed behind the floors to appear invisible from the interior and increase the feeling of openness.</p>
      <p>On the upper floor and in the stairwell long, narrow skylights cut through the concrete floor-plates draw light down into the interiors.</p>
