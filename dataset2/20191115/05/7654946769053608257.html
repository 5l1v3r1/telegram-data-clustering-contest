      <h1>Biden to Trump: ‘Release your taxes or shut up’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T05:17:01+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 05:17</time> by <a rel="author">Joe Tacopino</a></address>
      <p>Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1195182618364596224">told President Trump to “shut up”</a> after the commander in chief asked the Supreme Court to bar the release of his tax returns.</p>
      <p>Biden, the former vice president, referenced Trump’s repeated calls to stop corruption in countries like Ukraine, which has become the center of the current impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <p>“@realDonaldTrump, release your taxes or shut up about corruption,” Biden tweeted on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>Trump’s lawyers sent a petition to the Supreme Court on Thursday, urging them to hear an appeal after a ruling from a federal appeals court in Manhattan. The appeals court said state prosecutors may require third parties to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/us/politics/trump-tax-returns-supreme-court.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=tw-nytimes">turn over Trump’s financial records</a> for use in a grand jury investigation, according to The New York Times.</p>
      <p>The Bidens, meanwhile, have been the focus of much of Trump’s ire as the president claims he was seeking to root out corruption in Ukraine when he asked that country’s president to launch an investigation into Hunter Biden.</p>
      <p>“Where’s Hunter?” <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1183385881320853509?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1183385881320853509&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fthehill.com%2Fhomenews%2Fadministration%2F465586-trump-blasts-hunter-biden-in-tweet">Trump tweeted</a> last month. “He has totally disappeared! Now looks like he has raided and scammed even more countries! Media is AWOL.”</p>
      <p>Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company while his father was vice president.</p>
