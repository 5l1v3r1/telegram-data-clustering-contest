      <p>Japan Post Holdings Co. said Thursday its group revenue in the April-September half dropped 4.8 percent from a year earlier to ¥5.96 trillion.</p>
      <p>The fall was chiefly caused by a suspension in the promotion of insurance products from mid-July, following revelations of inappropriate insurance sales practices by the Japan Post Insurance Co. unit.</p>
      <p>The number of new insurance contracts declined 30,000, to 580,000, in the first half of the current business year.</p>
      <p>After the sales promotions were halted, the number of new insurance deals plunged to about 10 percent the level seen a year before, a senior Japan Post Insurance official said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Japan Post Holdings’ consolidated net profit rose 5.8 percent, to ¥236.5 billion, as labor costs at the Japan Post Co. unit, which sells the so-called Kanpo insurance policies at post offices, decreased in line with a voluntary sales restriction.</p>
      <p>“We have a sense of crisis about the fact we can’t secure new insurance contracts,” said Noboru Ichikura, Japan Post Holdings’ senior managing executive officer, at a news conference.</p>
      <p>Although the Japan Post group aims to resume its sales promotions in January, it has yet to set a specific date, a senior Japan Post official said.</p>
      <p>The insurance firm’s revenue fell 6.1 percent, to ¥3.66 trillion, due to the results of the misconduct, but it saw net profit grow 11.0 percent, to ¥76.3 billion, thanks to steady returns from asset investment and a drop in insurance sales commission fees paid to the postal unit.</p>
      <p>The company allocated ¥3.5 billion for investigations into over 180,000 policies suspected to be detrimental for their holders.</p>
      <p>At Japan Post, revenue fell 1.0 percent to ¥1.87 trillion due to a smaller income from commission. But its net profit doubled to ¥38.4 billion on the back of a reduction of personnel expenses linked to the sales of insurance.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Japan Post Bank suffered revenue and net profit drops, due chiefly to a decline in yields on its Japanese government bond holdings as the Bank of Japan continues its negative interest rate policy.</p>
