      <h1>Cuffing Season Is Real and Your Family Might Be to Blame, Says Study</h1>
      <h2>People Really Do Get Cuffed Just Because It’s Winter</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T05:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.askmen.com/authors/christina_majaski" target="_blank">Christina Majaski</a></address>
      <p>With temperatures dropping as the year winds down, singles who normally want nothing to do with a relationship are actively looking to keep themselves warm up with a significant other in their bed. And with the holidays fast approaching, scratching this itch inevitably leads to discussions of the upcoming concept of “cuffing season.” Why has it become such a phenomenon?</p>
      <p>Well, according to a recent study, your family might be to blame for your desire to find a mate during the colder months.</p>
      <p><b>RELATED:</b> <a href="https://www.askmen.com/dating/dating_advice/what-is-cuffing-season.html">Cuffing Season: When Is It and What Is It?</a></p>
      <p>A new study from <a href="https://www.lawnstarter.com/blog/statistics/cuffing-season-everything-we-learned-about-our-weird-winter-relationships/">LawnStarter</a> indicates that a majority of us believe in the existence of cuffing season, with 56 percent of those surveyed saying that it's real. That number may be slightly less than the number of people who still put faith in the spirit of old Saint Nick.</p>
      <p>Aside from the desire to cozy up with someone under a blanket, cuffing season provides you with someone to exchange Christmas presents with, to smooch under the mistletoe and to have on your arm when it comes to all those festive shindigs you’re inevitably to do.</p>
      <p>According to the study, one-third (35 percent) of respondents admitted to bringing someone special with them to the family feast just to satisfy expectations. And 16 percent of all those asked said their yuletide flings were motivated by pressure coming from family members.</p>

      <p>And which family member might that be, usually? Fingers are pointed at mom for this one. Of those who said that family pressure was a big factor in their decision to “cuff up” for the holidays, over half said it was their own mothers who hounded them over being single. Don't count grandma out, either, as she's not too far behind: 11 percent said it was the matriarch of the clan as the nosiest when it comes to her grandkids and their love interests.</p>
      <p>Dear old dad apparently doesn't have a problem with minding his own business, with only 5 percent of respondents saying their fathers ask about their relationships (brothers, uncles and grandpas were even less).</p>
      <p>For some, the decision to find cuff someone during this time is a little bit more selfish. About 7 percent of ladies and 10 percent of guys will hook up with someone just for the social media snapshots, and some dark-hearted survey respondents (just over 2 percent) copped to faking an actual interest just to get Christmas presents.</p>
      <p>Now that'll land you on the naughty list, for sure.</p>
