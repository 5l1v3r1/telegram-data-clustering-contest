      <p>WASHINGTON, Nov 15 — A man known as the "Potomac River rapist" who sexually assaulted at least 10 women and murdered one in the Washington area in the 1990s has been arrested, police said yesterday.</p>
      <p>Giles Warrick, 60, was taken into custody on Wednesday in the state of South Carolina, Washington police chief Peter Newsham announced at a press conference.</p>
      <p>“Between 1991 and 1998, a man terrorised our community as he brutally preyed upon and attacked multiple women across this region,” Newsham said.</p>
      <p>Warrick was identified as a suspect in the sexual assaults and the murder through forensic genealogy, he said.</p>
      <p>Several of the attacks occurred along footpaths next to the Potomac River, which runs through Washington.</p>
      <p>The last known attack attributed to the “Potomac River rapist” was in August 1998, when a 29-year-old woman was beaten to death with a rock while walking home from a party.</p>
      <p>Police said they managed to solve the cold case by matching DNA left behind by the suspect at the crime scenes to family trees in online genealogy databases.</p>
      <p>Several high-profile criminal cases have been solved recently through this technique, including that of the notorious serial killer and rapist known as the “"Golden Gate Killer.”</p>
      <p>Joseph DeAngelo, a former policeman, is suspected of at least a dozen murders and 50 rapes between 1976 and 1986 and is awaiting trial in California.</p>
      <p>DeAngelo was arrested in April 2018 after investigators tracked him down by plugging crime scene DNA into an open-source genealogy database. — AFP</p>
