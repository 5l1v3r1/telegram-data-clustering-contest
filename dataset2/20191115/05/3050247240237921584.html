      <h1>Institutional Investors Want These 3 Things Before Jumping Into Crypto</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T05:57:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 05:57</time> by <a rel="author">Agustin Beltramino</a></address>
      <p>Institutional investors aren’t being overlooked at <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/blockshow">BlockShow</a> Asia 2019.</p>
      <p>At a panel titled “Unlocking Yield In Cryptocurrency Assets — Encouraging Institutions To Enter The Industry,” a number of crypto leaders shared their thoughts on how to make emergent financial technology accessible to mainstream financial entities. Speakers included Jasper Lee, Managing Director at eToro Group Asia; Justin Chow, Head of Business Development Asia for Cumberland; Saharan Nair, Chief Business Officer at CoinSwitch; and Ben Zhou, co-founder and CEO at Bybit.</p>
      <p>Moderated by DataDash founder Nicholas Merten, the panel covered the role of institutional investors within the crypto world, and the challenges these investors face in entering the crypto space.</p>
      <p>Justin Chow kicked things off, saying:</p>
      <blockquote>“Custody, liquidity, and regulations are the top three petitions from institutional investors jumping into crypto.”</blockquote>
      <p>The other panelists agreed that these are essential catalysts, suggesting that institutional interest in crypto investing is growing day by day.</p>
      <p>Another high point of the debate occured when Merten asked the panelists which countries are making the best effort to adopt <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrencies">cryptocurrencies</a>. Jasper Lee said, “Which country is better really depends on what kind of business you want to focus on. For example, if you are in retail, you won’t go to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/hong-kong">Hong Kong</a>. You would probably pick island licenses.”</p>
      <p>Ben Zhou added: “From an exchange perspective, we are focused on retail clients. We are registered in the British Virgin Islands and have our headquarters in Singapore — the Singaporean government is open to crypto and blockchain technology. But I would love to see a framework in the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/united-states">US</a>, at least on how to get a proper license so that we can actually get into the market. We know it’s a huge market, but we can’t touch it.”</p>
      <p>Saharan Nair added that regulators have to make cryptocurrencies easy to use: “Regulations have to be designed for what the user wants and needs.”</p>
