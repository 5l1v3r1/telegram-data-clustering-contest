      <p>Picking your starter <a href="https://www.polygon.com/franchise/pokemon/701">Pokémon</a> is one of the most important decisions you can make in a Pokémon game, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/pokemon-sword-shield/40501"><i>Sword </i>and <i>Shield</i></a><i> </i>is no exception. If you’re stuck on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon/2019/2/27/18242888/pokemon-sword-shield-starters-grookey-sobble-scorbunny-switch">which starter</a> to pick, we’ve noted some things for you to consider.</p>
      <p>For the first time in over a decade, all three starters stay as their pure typing through their third evolution. <b>Scorbunny</b> will remain a fire-type, <b>Sobble</b> will remain a water-type, and <b>Grookey</b> will remain a grass-type.</p>
      <p>That being said, they still all learn a variety of moves from all different types.</p>
      <p>No matter which starter you pick, there won’t be much a difference in difficulty. The first three gym leaders in the game focus on <b>grass-types</b>, <b>water-types</b>, and <b>fire-types</b>, in that order, which means each starter will have a chance to shine once you start taking down gyms.</p>
      <p>In the short term, <b>Grookey </b>will be the best starter to pick, since it will be super effective in the second gym, and won’t take added damage in the (easier) first gym.</p>
      <p>Technically<b> Scorbunny </b>also has a slight advantage over the others in the later game since the sixth gym leader, <b>Melony, is an ice-type specialist, but only in Pokémon Shield</b>. <b>In Pokémon Sword, the sixth gym leader is Gordie, a rock-type user</b>, so <b>Sobble </b>and <b>Grookey </b>would be more helpful against him. Though by then you’ll likely already have an alternative Pokémon to help against them (if not several).</p>

      <p>It should be noted that the routes before the first gym leader, Milo, are filled with a diverse set of Pokémon, making it fairly easy to grab something to even out the field, even if you started with Sobble (who is weak in the first gym). For example, psychic- and flying-type Woobat can be found in Galar Mine right before the gym. Other grass-, fire-, and water-types can be found shortly after you start your adventure, so you’ll never be at an extreme disadvantage.</p>
      <p>Long story short, picking the “wrong” starter won’t dramatically impact the difficulty of <i>Pokémon Sword and Shield</i>, so really you should just opt for whichever one you like best. Or <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon/2019/11/1/20944379/pokemon-sword-and-shield-leaks-sobble-grookey">which one’s final evolution doesn’t horrify you</a>.</p>
