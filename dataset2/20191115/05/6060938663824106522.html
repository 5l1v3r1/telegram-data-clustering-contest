      <p>NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday pronounced former Ranbaxy promoters Malvinder Singh and Shivinder Singh guilty in a case filed by Japanese firm Daiichi Sankyo. Drug maker Daiichi had filed a petition against the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Singh-brothers">Singh brothers</a> on non payment of Rs 3,500 arbitration award.</p>
      <p>The top court said that the Singh brothers violated its order asking them not to divest their shares in Fortis Healthcare Limited.</p>
      <p>Daiichi sought enforcement of the arbitration award granted to it by Singapore tribunal in case against the Singh brothers.</p>
      <p>The Singh duo sold Ranbaxy to Daiichi in 2008. Sun Pharmaceuticals eventually purchased Ranbaxy from Daiichi for $3.2 billion.</p>
      <p>The case relates to the implementation of the arbitration award that the Singh brothers were ordered to pay to Daiichi in 2016. In March this year, Daiichi had filed a contempt plea against the brothers accusing them of disposing of their assets in violation of the court order.</p>
      <p>The Japanese drug maker had blamed the Singh brothers for allegedly suppressing facts during the sale of Ranbaxy.</p>
      <p>The two resigned as directors from the board of Fortis Healthcare in February 2018. Later in September, Shivinder filed a case against his brother alleging "oppression and mismanagement".</p>
