      <p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/26/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-story-trailer/"><i>Jedi: Fallen Order</i></a> has received <a href="https://www.criticalhit.net/gaming/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-reviews-round-up/">pretty decent</a> reviews, but it's arrival is actually good news for <i>Fortnite</i> fans, too. Why, do you ask? Because it comes with a slick new <i>Star Wars</i> <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order/stormtrooper-outfit-faq">stormtrooper cosmetic skin</a> available in <i>Fortnite</i>'s store or for free if you buy <i>Fallen Order</i> on the Epic Games store. If you'd rather not bump your head while battling, you'll still get some <i>Star Wars</i> perks in the form of a (barely visible) Imperial Destroyer currently floating around the Chapter 2 map.</p>
      <p>Epic Games has transformed Fortnite into a cross-promotional ad platform for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/04/25/fortnite-avengers-endgame-ltm-thanos/"><i>Avengers</i></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/05/16/john-wick-fortnite-ltm-wicks-bounty/"><i>John Wick</i></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/20/fortnite-batman-details-live-stream/"><i>Batman</i></a> and other games, films and even shoes and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/03/01/weezer-fortnite-new-album/">albums</a>. Many of those items are highly coveted among players, and Epic wisely plays on that by offering them on a time-limited basis.</p>
      <p>The standard stormtrooper skin is strictly cosmetic, but it is a freebie if you were planning to buy <i>Jedi: Fallen Order</i>. It's now available for a limited time (until November 30th) and costs 1,500 V-Bucks if purchased separately. More items could be coming, as it's described as "Part of the Original Trilogy set" in the Fortnite store.</p>
