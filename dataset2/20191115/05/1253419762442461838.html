      <p>Deep Silver and Nine Dots Studio have released the free “Permadeath, Postgame, and Poutine” content patch for Outward. In addition, Nine Dots Studio revealed that its open world RPG OUTWARD has sold more than 400,000 players from all over the world.</p>
      <p>Guillaume Boucher-Vidal, CEO of Nine Dots Studio, said:</p>
      <blockquote>“I never took for granted that Outward would perform well, but we wanted to trust the players’ ability to learn and adapt. I’m so glad that it paid off and it makes us that much more confident for our future development efforts.”</blockquote>

      <ul>

        </li>
        <li>
          <i><b>Addition of an Unarmed Attack: </b>Take a (figurative) page out of Monty Python black knight’s playbook – you don’t need arms to fight.</i>
