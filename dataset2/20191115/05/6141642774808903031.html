      <p>Most people have seen lichen, whether they know it or not.</p>
      <p>For those not in the know, it is that crusty, mouldy looking stuff often seen on trees or rocks.</p>
      <p>And to those in the know, it’s a combination of algae and fungi living together almost as if they were one organism.</p>
      <p>Either way, lichens are something scientists have long believed to be some of the first organisms to make their way onto land from water – until now.</p>
      <p>A new study upends the idea that lichen changed the planet’s atmosphere and paved the way for modern plants.</p>

      <p>Matthew Nelsen, lead author of the paper and a research scientist at the Field Museum in America, said: “When we look at modern ecosystems, and we see a bare surface like a rock, oftentimes lichens are the first thing to grow there, and eventually you’ll get plants growing on there too.</p>
      <p>“People have thought that maybe that’s the way ancient colonisation of land worked, but we’re seeing that these lichens actually came later in the game than plants.”</p>
      <p>Four hundred and eighty-five million years ago, hardly anything lived on land.</p>
      <p>But lichens can live in extreme conditions, grow on bare rocks and break them down, helping to create the soil needed by complex plants with roots.</p>
      <p>Scientists thought they must have arrived on land before such plants, making the environment more hospitable.</p>
      <blockquote>Lichens aren't as old as we thought they were<cite>Dr Matthew Nelson</cite></blockquote>
      <p>However, the new study – which was aimed at how the algae-fungi relationship came to be – calls the timeline into question.</p>
      <p>To accurately determine when lichens evolved, scientists examined the evolutionary history of both the fungi and algae that make them up.</p>
      <p>But the early lichen fossil record isn’t very clear, and all the fossils that scientists know for sure are lichens are younger than the oldest complex plant fossils.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the researchers used the fossils that were available to extrapolate the ages of family trees of lichen-forming fungi and algae.</p>
      <p>They compared these with ages of fossil plants, and found lichens probably evolved long after complex plants.</p>
      <p>Dr Nelson said: “Lichens aren’t as old as we thought they were.</p>
      <p>“They’re a younger, newer sort of symbiosis and haven’t been around forever, covering the earth long before there were plants and animals running around.”</p>
      <p>He added that the discovery reshapes the understanding of the early evolution of complex ecosystems on earth.</p>
