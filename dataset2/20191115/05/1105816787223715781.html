      <h1>ATP Finals: Federer outclasses Djokovic to reach semis</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T05:51:54+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 05:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/76/afp/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p><b>LONDON: </b>Roger Federer produced a near-flawless performance as he avenged his Wimbledon defeat by Novak Djokovic and qualified for the last four of the ATP Finals with a 6-4, 6-3 victory on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The Swiss started the tournament with a chastening straight-sets defeat to Dominic Thiem but found his best form when it mattered.</p>
      <p>Defeat for the second seed spells the end of his bid to overtake Rafael Nadal and finish as year-end number one.</p>
      <p>Roared on by a raucous packed house at London’s O2 Arena, six-time champion Federer looked in the groove from the start, cranking up the pressure on Djokovic’s serve and dropping just three points on his own serve in the first set.</p>
      <p>The Serbian upped his game at the start of the second set but Federer, 38, saved the one break point he faced and broke twice to canter to victory.</p>
      <p>The third seed, making his 17th appearance at the ATP Finals, is into his 16th semi-final at the year-end event.</p>
      <p>Djokovic needed to win the title to have a chance at knocking Nadal off the top spot, but now the Spaniard is guaranteed to finish the year as the top-ranked player for the fifth time, tying him with Federer, Djokovic and American Jimmy Connors.</p>
      <p>“Great atmosphere, great opponent,” said Federer, who hit 23 winners and made just five unforced errors. “It was definitely incredibly special. I enjoyed it from the beginning. I played incredible and I knew I had to because that’s what Novak does. It was definitely magical.”</p>
      <p>Speaking about what was different from the Wimbledon final, where he squandered two championship points on his own serve, he said: “I won match point I guess.</p>
      <p>“It was so close at Wimbledon. It was a privilege to play that match, so many ups and downs. I couldn’t be more happy right now.”</p>
      <p>Federer finishes second in Group Bjorn Borg, behind Thiem, who also beat Djokovic earlier this week. The Swiss will face the Group Andre Agassi winner on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Djokovic looked nervy at the start of the winner-takes-all contest, double-faulting twice in the third game, in which he was broken to love.</p>
      <p>As cries of “Let’s go Roger, let’s go” rang around the cavernous stadium, Federer was dead-eyed on his serve, hitting eight aces, including a second-serve ace, in the first set.</p>
      <p>Federer’s service level dipped in the second set and 32-year-old Djokovic earned his first break point of the match in the fourth game, which the Swiss saved.</p>
      <p>In the next game Djokovic slipped to 15-40 and sailed a forehand long to give Federer his second break of the match. The Swiss broke once more to close out victory.</p>
