      <p>SINGAPORE (Nov 15): The dollar and riskier trade-exposed currencies found some support on Friday as fresh hopes for a breakthrough in Sino-U.S. trade talks were tempered with caution.</p>
      <p>White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said late on Thursday that the two parties were getting close to a deal and the “mood music is pretty good”.</p>
      <p>He offered no new details, but the sentiment was enough to reverse a little of the safe-haven Japanese yen’s overnight gain and to buoy the Australian and New Zealand dollars.</p>
      <p>The yen JPY= fell 0.2% to 108.57 per dollar and dropped 0.3% on the rising Aussie.</p>
      <p>The Australian dollar AUD=D3, which had tumbled on Thursday after an unexpected rise in the national unemployment rate, added 0.2% to $0.6795.</p>
      <p>The New Zealand dollar NZD=D3 rose 0.1% to $0.6388. China's yuan CNY= rose 0.2% but remained just shy of strengthening past the 7-per-dollar level at 7.0076.</p>
      <p>Against a basket of six major currencies .DXY the greenback was steady at 98.140 as caution and the lack of concrete news in Kudlow’s remarks kept a lid on risk appetite.</p>
      <p>“It may not be a game-changer,” said Terence Wu, a treasury strategist at OCBC Bank in Singapore. “Thus, we think any reversal in the risk-off trades may not see a good shelf-life.”</p>
      <p>Mixed signals on trade negotiations have abounded in recent days while evidence of the damage the dispute is wreaking on the global economy has mounted.</p>
      <p>The next scheduled economic updates are Eurozone trade and inflation data due at 1000 GMT and the New York Fed manufacturing survey due at 1330 GMT.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, China’s commerce ministry said the two countries are holding “in-depth” discussions, while U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday a deal was close.</p>
      <p>But the Financial Times, citing unidentified people close to the talks, said an agreement may not be reached in time to avoid a new round of U.S. tariffs taking effect on Dec. 15.</p>
      <p>Sub-par growth figures on Thursday from China and Japan, followed by lacklustre updates in Britain and Europe underlined the potential downside if a deal falters.</p>
      <p>Few are game to make a decisive call either way.</p>
      <p>“Until we’ve got the word from Donald Trump, no-one’s really willing to get in front of it,” said Jason Wong, senior market strategist at BNZ in Wellington.</p>
      <p>The British pound, meanwhile, sat near peaks scaled overnight.</p>
      <p>Sterling GBP= touched a six-month high against the euro and gained on the dollar as expectations that Britain's ruling Conservative Party might win a majority in a Dec. 12 election fuelled optimism the Brexit impasse will finally end.</p>
      <p>The pound stood at $1.2880 and at 0.8559 pence per euro in Asian trade. “Markets now appear to be priced for a high likelihood of a majority Conservative government,” RBC Chief Currency Strategist Adam Cole said in a note.</p>
