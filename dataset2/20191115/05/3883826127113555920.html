        <figcaption>The Daily Express leads on Boris Johnson's plans for an "ambitious" package of tax cuts aimed at saving Britain's ailing high streets. The prime minister has vowed to slash business rates for shops and pubs as part of a drive to revitalise struggling town centres, the paper says.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>For the Metro, the NHS was "thrust to the centre of the election debate" after figures showed A&amp;E waiting times as being the longest on record. The paper quotes the Society of Acute Medicine's president as warning the system is "imploding".</figcaption>

        <figcaption>One of those affected by the long waits was WWII veteran Brian Fish, who was left in "agony" on an A&amp;E trolley for 10 hours, reports the Daily Mirror. His daughter, Hilary Casement, told the paper Boris Johnson would not have let the same thing happen to his own dad.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>Elsewhere, council leaders in northern England have called for "massive" increases in funding following ongoing floods in the region, says the Guardian. As affected areas are braced for further downpours, the leaders of six councils demanded immediate and long-term financial support to help them recover from the disaster.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>The Daily Telegraph says Nigel Farage threatened to report the Conservatives to the police after accusing Downing Street of offering Brexit Party candidates jobs and peerages to withdraw from the general election. The Brexit Party leader claimed the Tories were guilty of "corruption of the worst level", alleging the party had offered eight peerages. No 10 has categorically denied any inducements were offered.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>The Daily Mail leads on criticism of Jeremy Corbyn by candidates hoping to become MPs for Labour. The paper describes the remarks, which it says it uncovered on social media and in articles, as a "fresh humiliation" for the Labour leader.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>Google is planning to limit advertisers' access to personal data following user privacy concerns, says the Financial Times - but the move has been criticised by online ad agencies as self-serving for the company. From February, the US tech group will stop advertisers viewing information that breaks down the content of an app or web pages when they bid for display adverts.</figcaption>

The paper says the actor, best known for playing Barry Evans on the soap, has called in celebrity medium Derek Acorah to sort the problem.</figcaption>

        <b>The face of Nigel Farage peering out of the window of a crabbing boat in Grimsby appears on the front of the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/11/14/nigel-farages-election-campaign-flounders-claims-tories-want/">Daily Telegraph</a>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It says the Brexit Party leader has threatened to report the Conservatives to the police - after he accused Downing Street of trying to bribe his election candidates with jobs and peerages if they agreed not to stand. Number 10 has vehemently denied making such offers.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10350897/boris-johnson-gets-majority/">The Sun</a> says candidates pulling out of the election is a good thing - if it gives the Tories a clear run in Labour-held marginals.</p>
      <p>"Some of Mr Farage's people now grasp the monstrous risk he is having them take," the paper argues in its editorial.</p>
      <p>"They do not want the blame for Labour sneaking through to win a seat they would otherwise have lost."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/war-veteran-99-left-crying-20884699">"Betrayed"</a> is the headline on the front of the Daily Mirror, which pictures 99-year-old Brian Fish, who spent 10 hours in pain on an A&amp;E trolley waiting for treatment.</p>
      <p>The paper says figures released on Thursday - showing hospital performance in England is at its worst level on record - "stand as a damning indictment of nearly 10 years of Tory rule".</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-7684841/October-worst-month-E-just-83-6-NHS-patients-seen-four-hours.html">The Daily Mail</a> says the figures have come "at the worst possible time" for the Conservatives, but it believes things would deteriorate further if they were removed from power.</p>
      <p>"Labour's tax, borrow and spend madness would bankrupt the country", it claims in its editorial, "and the NHS along with it".</p>

      <p>The author John Le Carr√© and the co-founder of Wikipedia, Jimmy Wales, are among <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/14/concerns-about-antisemitism-mean-we-cannot-vote-labour">24 public figures who've written to the Guardian saying they will "refuse" to vote for Labour at the election because of concerns about the way the party has handled allegations of anti-Semitism</a>.</p>
      <p>In an open letter, they say the pain felt by the Jewish community "has been relegated as an issue, pushed aside by arguments about Britain's European future".</p>
      <p>In response, Labour says it's an "extraordinary" letter given that some of the other signatories have themselves been accused of anti-Semitism, Islamophobia or misogyny.</p>
      <p>It adds that the party is taking "robust action" to root out anti-Jewish behaviour.</p>
      <h3>Onion shortage</h3>
      <p>Figures compiled by the Guardian show that well over 1,700 properties in the north of England have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/14/council-leaders-demand-huge-funding-rise-after-floods">directly affected by flooding in the past week</a> - more than double the Environment Agency's official estimate.</p>
      <p>The paper says the leaders of several councils in Yorkshire have written to the government demanding "massive" increases in funding to help them recover from the floods, which they believe have caused "considerable and lasting damage on a wide scale".</p>
      <p>The mayor of the Sheffield city region, Dan Jarvis, has also asked officials to review defences on the River Don - one of the waterways hit hardest in recent days.</p>
      <p>According to the Financial Times, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/958e86c8-0627-11ea-9afa-d9e2401fa7ca">an onion shortage is fuelling fears of social unrest in India</a>.</p>
      <p>Extreme heat followed by torrential rain during the monsoon season have led to a sharp fall in production of the vegetable - a key ingredient in many of the country's most popular dishes.</p>
      <p>Wholesale prices have risen by almost 500% since the start of the year, while ministers have pledged to import 100,000 tonnes of onions to try to rebalance the market.</p>
      <p>The FT points out that similar crises have been linked to the downfall of more than one government since 1980.</p>

      <p>And most of the papers review one of the most anticipated film sequels of the year - Disney's Frozen 2.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/film/frozen-2-review-disney-sequel-20879306">Daily Mirror gives it four stars</a>, saying it surpasses the first film for fun and adventure and "is guaranteed to enchant a new generation of fans".</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7686423/BRIAN-VINER-reviews-Frozen-2.html">Daily Mail is less impressed</a>. "One of the joys of the original was its simplicity," says Brian Viner.</p>
      <p>"This is a different kettle of frozen fish, with a plot that will befuddle most seven-year-olds and frankly, writing from experience, a few 57-year-olds."</p>
