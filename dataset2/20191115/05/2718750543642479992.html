      <p>Jhené Aiko has released the video for her breakup single, “None of Your Concern.” The song talks about the ways communication breaks down after a couple splits, but it could also be the reply to the question, “Hey, why did you guest on your ex’s single about how being in a relationship with you hindered his personal growth?” Or “Why is your ex on <i>your </i>breakup single?” It’s none of our concern. This is either the most healthy conscious uncoupling since Gwyneth and Chris Martin, the most codependent tailing-off period since Ross and Rachel, or the biggest con since Liberace and Rosemary Clooney. Or all three! None of my concern!</p>
