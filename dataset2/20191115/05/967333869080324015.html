        <b>CAIRO (Sputnik) – Sixty-six Iraqi security officers have been put on trial over the excessive use of force in dispersing protesters, government spokesman Saad Hadisi, said amid unrest in the Middle Eastern country.</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>On Thursday, the spokesman said live on Al Arabiya that "1,600 demonstrators arrested for participating in protests have been released and 66 security officers faced trial".</blockquote>
      <p>The UN Human Rights Council said last week that at least 269 people <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201911071077250531-IraqSecurityForcesKillAtLeast4ProtestersBreakUpSit-InRallyinBasra-Report/">had been killed in the protests</a>.</p>
      <p>Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi said that he would carry out a cabinet reshuffle and introduce changes to election laws. Mahdi said that the government's resignation, demanded by protesters, would throw the country into chaos.</p>
      <p>Mass anti-government demonstrations have been underway in the Iraqi capital Baghdad and several southern areas since October. They have <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201911091077266756-iraq-three-demonstrators-reportedly-gunned-down-near-baghdads-tahrir-square/">often turned violent</a> and protesters have condemned government forces for attacking them, including with the use of live ammunition.</p>
