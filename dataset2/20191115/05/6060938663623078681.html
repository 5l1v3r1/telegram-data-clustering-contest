      <hr/>
      <p>NEW DELHI: The monkey is off the back. The Olympic berth is in the bag. The Asian Games disappointment is now a distant memory than a deep wound. It was a "stressful" qualifier, in coach <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Graham-Reid">Graham Reid</a>'s words. Not so much because of the opposition, a gritty but manageable Russia, but the 'what-ifs' that raised their head after the first game and when the Russians scored the opening goal in the second. But it's over. The dreaded is dead, and buried. It's time to get back to the workshop.</p>
      <p>The core group of players will assemble for the national camp on November 18, this time at Bhubaneswar's <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kalinga-Stadium">Kalinga Stadium</a> instead of the SAI Centre in Bengaluru. The reason is Pro League.</p>
      <p>
        <b>A WELL-TIMED DEBUT</b>
      </p>
      <p>Beginning their Olympic year, in January 2020, India will make their debut in the Pro League -- FIH's youngest baby. Looking at the 2020 calendar, until the squad lands in Tokyo in July, the preparatory road couldn't have been better laid out. And all of India's home games in the Pro League are expected to be played in the Odisha capital, so Bhubaneswar as the first choice for the national camp was a no-brainer.</p>
      <p>Between January 18 and June 14 next year, India play the Netherlands, Australia, Belgium and New Zealand at home and Germany, Great Britain, Argentina and Spain away. That's 16 matches against teams that are in top nine of the FIH Rankings, including the reigning world champions the Red Lions and world No. 1 Kookaburras.</p>
      <p>"Pro League is a big opportunity to work (prepare) for the Olympics and there are a lot of games during that period. That's one of the things that Pro League does, it sets up competition schedule between now and the Olympics," said Graham Reid talking to Timesofindia.com.</p>
      <p>
        <b>NO AZLAN SHAH APPEARANCE?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The men's <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/hockey">hockey</a> calendar for 2020 on the Hockey India website has no mention of the Sultan Azlan Shah Cup, a tournament that India has regularly participated in. But it may not be the case for the 29th edition of Malaysia's premier event.</p>
      <p>Reid confirmed that, though with a rider.</p>
      <p>"No, Azlan Shah we are not (playing). That's the latest I've heard, unless Malaysia come back and change the dates. But at the moment, I don't think we are (going). So, therefore, we will have to work out what we do in that period. But I'm also not so concerned about that because it is a pretty full competition schedule with the Pro League," said the Australian, who was appointed in April this year.</p>
      <p>In the past, though, India have sent experimental squads to Sultan Azlan Shah Cup. With the Olympics knocking at the door and most first-choice players expected to feature in the Pro League, it won't be a bad idea to keep an eye on youngsters by putting them in competition mode in Malaysia, especially when the junior men's team calendar is blank so far for the period before June 16 next year, when the boys travel for a tour of Europe.</p>

        <b>ON THE CORRECTION TABLE</b>
      </p>
      <p>One thing that worried Reid during the Olympic qualifiers was the intensity, or the lack of it, in India's game.</p>
      <p>Over the first six months of his stint, Reid has consistently talked about increasing intensity in training and on the field, irrespective of the opponent. Maybe that was the reason for the joint training Reid introduced during the tour of Belgium, when India travelled to Netherlands to train with the Dutch team.</p>
      <p>The Indian think-tank compared their GPS numbers with those of the Dutch and probably set the benchmark as well. But worryingly for Reid, those numbers dropped by an alarming 15 percent against Russia. While he promises to ask questions in the camp, Reid just hopes it's not the "complacency thing".</p>
      <p>"I'm still trying to work that out (why the GPS numbers dropped). We talked about it as much as we can between (two Olympic qualifier) games. When it's back to back, you don't want to dig too deep into it because they (players) need to be up for the next game.</p>
      <p>"But certainly, in the camp, we will be analysing that more and going through a little more as to hear what was going through the mind (of players). And what I was trying to work out was (whether) it's the complacency thing, which is what we've been trying to guard against, of course," the coach said.</p>
      <p>India defeated Russia 4-2 in the first game of the qualifier and then woke up in the second to thrash the visitors 7-1 and emerge 11-3 winners on aggregate.</p>
      <p>"When you analyse, I had been thinking 'okay, whether it was complacency, if that 10-0 we had in June (during FIH Series Finals) was still at the back of their minds.' They were really up for it during the day, on Friday (Nov 1). The team was very vibrant and buoyant. So I don't think it was the part of pressure, nerves and all that.</p>
      <p>"We will be back to Bhubaneswar (for the national camp) and have a chance to also look more at the footage and the (GPS) numbers and then we can perhaps ask some more poignant questions or important questions to the players to work out how those sort of things don't happen," the 55-year-old Reid told TimesofIndia.com.</p>

      <p>
        <b>ANY PASSENGERS IN THE TEAM?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Reid was quite honest and professional facing this pointed question.</p>
      <p>Veteran Rupinder Pal Singh made a comeback to the squad, while another senior Birender Lakra was called up only after an injury to Varun Kumar. Also, youngsters like the promising Vivek Sagar Prasad and Gurinder Singh will continue to be analysed closely in run-up to the Olympics, with players like Jarmanpreet Singh, Mandeep Mor, Dilpreet Singh and others waiting in the wings.</p>
      <p>"I don't like to name particular players or whatever, so I won't get into that," said Reid in his response. "But, I think, we didn't see the best of some of our players, certainly on Friday (Nov 1). On Saturday, I think, we were closer to everybody playing better.</p>
      <p>"To be very honest, that was the problem with Friday's game. We didn't have enough players, not just one or two but probably four of five, who performed (at a level) where they really can."</p>
      <p>
        <b>IS A MENTAL CONDITIONING COACH ON THE WAY?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lack of consistency remains the bane of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Indian-hockey">Indian hockey</a>. If the penalty-corner battery was right on the mark in Belgium, it woke up only during the second game of the Olympic qualifier against Russia. Similarly, the finishing improved only once the Russians sent a scare through the Indian camp by scoring two goals in the first match.</p>
      <p>"I think it's probably a little bit late to bring in (a mental conditioning coach)...but it's definitely a fair call. I think you need to have more time (for that) and it's important for me (a coach) to get to know them because I think it's important that when you have sports psychologists, they are in tune with the way I (a coach) think as well," Reid concluded.</p>
