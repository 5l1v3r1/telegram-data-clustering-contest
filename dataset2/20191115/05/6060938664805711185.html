      <p>NEW DELHI: India's threat of withdrawing from the Birmingham <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Commonwealth-Games">Commonwealth Games</a> over shooting's exclusion still stands, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Indian-Olympic-Association">Indian Olympic Association</a> (IOA) president Narinder Batra said here on Thursday after the day-long meeting between a <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Commonwealth-Games-Federation">Commonwealth Games Federation</a> (CGF) delegation from Britain and the IOA's top brass failed to find a common ground on the issue.</p>
      <p>CGF president Louise Martin, its CEO David Grevemberg, IOA secretary general <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Rajeev-Mehta">Rajeev Mehta</a> and Batra failed to break the deadlock over the Birmingham Organising Committee's (OC) decision to drop shooting - an optional sport in the CWG - from the 2022 Games edition. The IOA asked the visiting CGF representatives to hold a <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Commonwealth-shooting-championships">Commonwealth shooting championships</a> for participating nations closer to the Games and count the medals won at the tournament towards the official medal tally of the Birmingham Games.</p>
      <p>Martin separately told TOI that shooting will not be part of the Birmingham CWG as the decision had been made by the host city, but the effort would be to look beyond 2022 Games and to ensure smooth conduct of shooting events at the future CWG editions in 2026 and 2030. Batra said there was discussion towards bringing back shooting among core sports before 2026 and 2030</p>
      <p>CWG, which will make it a compulsory sport in the Games roster. Mehta revealed that India has shown interest in bidding to host the 2026 CWG edition in New Delhi.</p>
      <p>"The term boycott I had used previously was not appropriate. It should have been withdrawal, so I would use the term 'option of withdrawing from the Games'. The meeting today was both successful and fruitful but the proposal of withdrawal from 2022 CWG still stands," Batra said, with Martin and Grevemberg in attendance.</p>
      <p>"We will take into consideration the discussions we had with the CGF officials, and then go back to our executive committee and the general body to take a final decision," Batra informed. While the EC is planned for November 23, the general body meeting could happen in late December.</p>
      <p>Martin, on her part, maintained that they managed to discuss all issues on the table and the IOA's views will be communicated to the Games' organisers. Grevemberg informed that three optional sports which made to the Birmingham CWG at the expense of shooting - women's T20 cricket, beach volleyball and para table tennis - were included "keeping in mind the affordability and sustainability of venues for host nation and its partners".</p>
      <p>However, Martin, talking to TOI after the press briefing, expressed disappointment over India's threat to withdraw from the Games, saying it was Mehta and then IOA president, N Ramachandran, who had voted along with 71 other Commonwealth member nations in December 2015 in Auckland, to keep shooting as an optional sport for the Birmingham Games.</p>
      <p>Martin also said she will take IOA's proposal of a shooting championship closer to Birmingham Games to the organisers for discussion. Talks with <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/International-Shooting-Sport-Federation">International Shooting Sport Federation</a> (ISSF) in December during its General Assembly in Munich will help in exploring the possibility of such an event. "The decision will then be communicated to the IOA," she added. TOI understands from sources that such an option is "practically not implementable" as the Birmingham organisers aren't going to play ball.</p>
