      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T06:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Herbert Soden</a></address>
      <p>A luxurious new bar featuring wine tasting and local beers will be opening in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/wallsend">Wallsend</a>, if the council give the go-ahead to the plans.</p>
      <p>Businessman Steven Ratcliff decided to open a watering hole on the high street after he realised there was nowhere in the town him and his wife Lauren wanted to have a drink.</p>
      <p>"When me and my wife socialise its with friends who live in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/whitley-bay">Whitley Bay </a>and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/tynemouth">Tynemouth,</a>" he said.</p>
      <p>"Every-time we said 'do you want to go for a quick drink, or bite to eat' we realised there wasn't much in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/wallsend">Wallsend.</a></p>
      <p>"In mine and Lauren's opinion there is a lot of professional, more affluent people in the town who want somewhere like this.</p>
      <p>"My wife is my muse and she is a great sounding board for my ideas, I wanted to open the kind of place we would like to socialise in.</p>
      <p>"I own a salon in the town and I get a lot of feedback from customers and they are all really excited."</p>
      <p>Mr Ratcliff has applied to <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/north-tyneside-council">North Tyneside Council</a> for permission to sell alcohol, hot food and drink, and provide entertainment at his premises between midday and 11pm seven days a week.</p>
      <p>And if he is successful he expects the bar to open its doors for the very first time in March next year.</p>
      <p>He said: "I want people to be able to come for a sociable couple of drinks before they go home and get up for work the next day.</p>
      <p>"I'm working with the police and I'll be responsible."</p>
      <p>He has also asked for permission to offer live music between, midday and 10pm.</p>
      <p>"I want to put on local comedians and acoustic artists," he explained.</p>
      <p>Mr Ratcliff said he will be working with local businesses to offer a tantalising range of drinks and anti-pasti platters.</p>
      <p>"I am working with Tyne Bank Brewery and a Gosforth wine merchant. I'll be offering wine tasting nights to get people's palette's going.</p>
      <p>"There is a lot of younger professional people buying their first homes in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/wallsend">Wallsend</a> I want to encourage them to use the town, and this will be good for the local economy."</p>
      <p>North Tyneside Council's licensing department have yet to make a decision on the application.</p>
