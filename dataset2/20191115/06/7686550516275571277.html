      <h1>Gold club becomes the first to use fully recyclable cups</h1>
      <h2>It's the first one to stock the 'Frugal Cup'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T06:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Lea Nakache</a></address>
      <p>Stoke-on-Trent's Trentham Golf Club is the first to switch from cardboard cups to fully recyclable ones, called the Frugal Cup.</p>
      <p>Paper cups are bonded on one side to a robust plastic film, making them impossible to join the recycling chains.</p>
      <p>However, the<a href="https://www.frugalpac.com/"> Frugal Cup</a> is made entirely from recycled paper, and consists of two elements that separate so both the paperboard and food-grade liner which can be easily recycled during the standard recycling process.</p>

      <p>Una Handley, general manager at Trentham GC commented:“We’re delighted to be stocking Frugal Cup and the Frugal Lid.</p>
      <p>"Switching to a recyclable coffee cup supplier was vital to us as we’re committed to using sustainable solutions across the business.</p>
      <p>"When we started to research the options out there, we were shocked to discover that many of the cups available on the market were, in fact, not easily recycled in the UK.”</p>
      <p>In Britain, more than two and a half billion cups are used every year, bu<a href="https://www.frugalpac.com/the-truth-behind-coffee-cup-recycling/">t less than 0.25% of them are being recycled,</a> the vast majority ending in landfills or the ocean.</p>
      <p>And the situation is predicted to get worse: according to a report by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and Eunomia Research &amp; Consulting, the UK is set to throw away one third more single-use coffee cups than at present, by 2030.</p>
      <p>To target this issue, Frugalpac supports a <a href="https://www.change.org/p/starbucks-a-petition-to-get-all-uk-coffee-shops-using-fully-recyclable-cups?recruiter=941433542&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;utm_campaign=share_petition">petition</a> to get all UK coffee shops to convert to entirely sustainable cups.</p>
