      <p>Some gunmen have abducted a worker with the <i>Nigerian Television Authority</i>, Abiodun Adenuga, in his Aiyepe residence in the  Odogbolu Local Government Area  of Ogun State.</p>
      <p>A family source told our correspondent that Adenuga was abducted around 10pm on Tuesday at his house where the gunmen held him at gunpoint and whisked him away.</p>
      <p>He was reportedly abducted after he returned from the <i>NTA</i> Ijebu-Ode office.</p>
      <p>The family source told our correspondent that the abductors had contacted the family and demanded a ransom of N15m.</p>
      <p>According to the source, although the abductors had opened negotiations with the family, they refused to reduce the money.</p>
      <p>The  Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Abimbola Oyeyemi,  confirmed the incident.</p>
      <p>Oyeyemi said the command was aware that someone was kidnapped in Aiyepe on Tuesday.</p>

      <p>The PPRO disclosed that the abductors lured the victim out of his house by switching off his generator.</p>
      <p>He said, “The command is aware of a case of abduction of somebody. We don’t know whether he is an <i>NTA</i> worker or not.</p>
      <p>“We learnt that the abductors switched off the victim’s generator and when he went out to put it on, he was grabbed and taken away.</p>
      <p>“We have swung into action and we are on their trail. Very soon, we will apprehend them.”</p>
