      <p>Two years after <i>The Crown</i> season two was released, the royal drama returns to Netflix for its third season with a brand new cast playing the British royal family.</p>
      <p>The expansive and expensive show — which is estimated to have cost Netflix "upward of $150 million," per a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/magazine/the-crown-peter-morgan.html">recent <i>New York Times</i> report</a> — focuses much of its third season on the monarchs finding their purpose in a rapidly modernizing world.</p>
      <p>As a recent <i>New York Times Magazine</i> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/magazine/the-crown-peter-morgan.html">profile</a> on creator Peter Morgan pointed out, the series "lifts the curtain on the whole royal enterprise.<i> The Crown</i> doesn’t feed public fantasy — it pours cold water on it."</p>
      <p>While much of each season is derived from public record and meticulous research, at the end of the day it's a fiction series that takes the occasional artistic liberty — like, say, having a politician resign in 1967 instead of 1965.</p>
      <p>"I think there’s a covenant of trust with the audience," Morgan told the <i>Times</i>. "They understand a lot of it is conjecture. Sometimes there are unavoidable accuracy blips — an event might not have taken place where, or even when, I imagined it did. But I’m absolutely fastidious about there being an underlying truth."</p>
      <p>Ahead of the season's release, revisit where season two ended, learn where season three will pick up and get to know the new faces of the series with <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i>'s handy primer.</p>

        <b>Where the Story Left Off</b>
      </p>
      <p>At the end of season two, the marriage troubles between Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip had come to a head, and the couple had just welcomed their fourth child, Prince Edward.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Where Season 3 Picks Up</b>
      </p>
      <p>As with seasons one and two, not much time will have passed when the season begins. Britain has elected a new prime minister, Harold Wilson, and the Queen isn't necessarily excited by the new politician she'll have to work with for the next several years. (Spoiler alert for history: They do eventually develop a working relationship.)</p>
      <p>A major theme of the season sees the royals reflecting on their place in modern British society, and how they'll be able to serve their people in the changing '60s and '70s. Meanwhile, the marriage between Princess Margaret and Antony Armstrong-Jones is crumbling, Prince Charles is preparing for his future royal duties and falling in love and Prince Philip is thinking about how to modernize the monarchy.</p>

      <p>While the characters are familiar, the faces are new.
