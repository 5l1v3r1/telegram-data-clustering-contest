      <h1>Nathan Patterson makes honest Rangers admission as he opens up on James Tavernier chats</h1>
      <h2>The Scotland U-19s star trains with the first team and admits Tavernier has been a useful sounding board.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T06:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">David McCarthy, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/david-mccarthy/</a></address>
      <p>Nathan Patterson knows it’s a big ask for any of the Rangers kids to break into <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a>’s first team.</p>
      <p>But the 18-year-old arguably has the toughest task of any of his team-mates who will take on Wrexham in Saturday's Tunnock’s Caramel Wafer Cup quarter final.</p>
      <p>The man blocking the young right back’s path to the top team is captain and almost ever-present <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/james-tavernier">James Tavernier</a>, but Patterson has turned that potential negative into a massive positive by using Tavernier as a motivation to become the best he can be.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scotland-u19s-football-team">Scotland U19</a> international Patterson trains with the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> first team and admits Tavernier has been a useful sounding board.</p>

      <p>He said: “It is a good challenge having the captain playing in your position. I want to play for this club, so I will be trying my best to put in good performances. If I can do that then hopefully a chance might come for me.</p>
      <p>“You don’t want to cruise through in football, you want to be tested every single day as that makes you better. I have spoken to Tav a few times but sometimes you have to dig deep and do your own thing.</p>
      <p>“My style of football is similar to him in terms of being an attacking full-back. I have been involved with the first team a few times which has been good. I want to evolve my game around what the first team need.</p>
      <p>“Training with the first team is a lot more intense and the standard is a lot higher as you would expect. But it is good to give yourself that challenge against top players every day and I am loving it.”</p>
      <p>Patterson can’t wait to run out at Ibrox against Wrexham and is relishing another opportunity to pit their wits against a ‘men’s’ team, having already knocked out Berwick Rangers, Stranraer, Ballymena and Solihull Moors.</p>

      <p>He added: “It is obviously a bonus for us as it is the stadium we want to play at sooner rather than later. Playing at Ibrox, in front of a crowd is what we want to do at our age. It gives us a taste of the end goal for us.</p>
      <p>“We have done well but we know we have a strong squad. We have struggled in a few games but we have dug deep to get the results we needed.</p>
      <p>“We have come a long way in this tournament and we want that to continue. We play in the youth Champions League and then we go up against men, it is totally different.</p>
      <p>“We have coped with that challenge really well. It is a learning curve for us. These guys have played in big games in their career and are used to it. But we have managed to get the better of them which has been really pleasing.</p>
      <p>“We aren’t the biggest physically compared to some of these teams but we have managed to deal with that challenge. We have played out own game and stuck to our plan and it has paid off.</p>
      <p>“We have a strong squad and we have a belief and confidence that we can go far in this tournament. We believe we can get results against anyone.”</p>
