      <p>Sidharth Malhotra was desperately looking for a hit after a string of flops, Tara Sutaria surely needed a jump after a hiccup in her debut. A miracle will be required for that to materialise with Marjaavaan. Do miracles really happen?<br/><br/>So, Sidharth Malhotra is given the enviable task of becoming a Dharmendra and an Amitabh Bachchan both. Milap sets out to do a Salim-Javed. Tara Sutaria plays a damsel in distress aka the wronged lover or sister of the 80s. The rest, as they say, is history. Gasping for breath. You still want me to go on?</p>

      <p>Nora Fatehi struts around in a remix and you can go out for a few yawns and have a cup of tea. If and when you come back, nothing much would have changed. </p>

      <p>Suddenly, a thought might race in your head. Why is Milap synonym with cheap dialogues? Sample this: The height of hope is defecating on the sands and hoping that the waves will give you a wash. Imagine hearing this in Hindi! There is at least one more when it comes to the several others on heights, you see Riteish Deshmukh plays a dwarf longing for height. So yeah, the hope of this and the hope of that goes on and on- while the one I told you has the word tatti, there's another one which has the word pishaab! Sach, just these two are enough to make you skip dinner if you've planned a candlelit one post the movie even with your beloved.<br/><br/>The talented Rakul Preet Singh shocked me with her miniscule role. What was she? Cheerleader at best! Milap, Milap, Milap...<br/><br/>Milap Milan Zaveri, who has not only directed the film but also written it, should have at least seen a few revengeful  dramas of the 70s and 80s.  Which villain of yesteryear spoke about poop and urine with his henchmen or otherwise? </p>

      <p>Honestly, Sidharth and Tara have not failed, blame it on Milap who has dealt a big blow to their careers. The film should have ended at the interval. In fact, it so much looks a scene prior to the interval that it is (thankfully) indeed coming to a close then. </p>
      <p>Milap, please run for an extensive course in what's script and screenplay in a herogiri flick. </p>

      <p>I ran out of the screening as it ended, tried to recover my well-being at home with a protein shake and thanked my stars when I opened my eyes in the morning to find that I was living to see another day. Miracles do happen!<br/><br/>So 0.5 for that miracle and 2 cumulatively.<br/><br/><br/><i>Image Source:- youtube/ T-series</i></p>
