        <i>Qantas Dreamliner lands as part of trial for what would be the longest commercial route</i>
      </p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/qantas">Qantas</a> flight from London to Sydney has touched down safely after 19 hours and 19 minutes, as part of a trial for what would be the world’s longest-ever commercial route.</p>
      <p>The Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner took off on Thursday morning UK time and landed in Sydney at lunchtime on Friday. “We saw a double sunrise,” Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said after stepping off the flight. Qantas named the effort “Project Sunrise” after the airline’s endurance flights during the second world war.</p>
      <p>The test flight carried just 40 people, including crew, had enough fuel for roughly another 1 hour 45 minutes of flight time when it landed. A Dreamliner can usually carry up to 300 people, but at present it is impossible to fly a plane at full capacity in terms of both passengers and cargo from London to Sydney without refuelling.</p>

      <p>Those on board were mostly Qantas employees fitted with monitors to track sleep patterns, food and drink intake, lighting and physical movement.</p>
      <p>It was the second aircraft to fly the route non-stop, with the first touching down in August 1989. The Boeing 747-400 that undertook the journey carried only crew, and is now in a museum.</p>
      <p>Qantas flew a Dreamliner non-stop from New York to Sydney last month, although the route is about 1,600km (1,000 miles) shorter.</p>
      <p>It comes as the Australian national carrier celebrates 100 years of service. It needs to get pilots to agree on contract terms and a sign-off from Australia’s aviation regulator to launch the flights by 2023.</p>
      <p>Among those at Sydney airport to greet QF7879 were prime minister Scott Morrison and opposition leader Anthony Albanese, as well as Qantas chairman Richard Goyder.</p>
