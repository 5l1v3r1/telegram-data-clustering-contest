      <p><b>Q: How much are we looking at for Gerrit Cole? </b><br/>A: Maybe getting to $35 million-$40 million per year, depending on the length, because the guy is still in his prime and he could scarcely be coming off a better season. Not just a guy in his physical prime, but someone who maximizes what is out there now. He’s using the baseball ops department and all their information to become a better pitcher and more skilled at the craft of pitching. That will be very attractive to these teams that understand that pitching is also learning from the data and technology that’s out there.</p>
      <p><b>Q: Why do you think free agency has become so drawn out? </b><br/>A: It’s probably almost every front office being aware of market forces and efficient in how they value players. You don’t have two, three, five rogue teams operating in their own sphere. Teams understand now, everyone wants to win, but everybody can’t win every year. Most teams probably understand that there is a three- to five-year cycle and sometimes you have to push all-in and sometimes you have to pull way back. A lot of teams pulling way back has kept the bidding down.</p>
      <p><b>Q: Who do you expect to be the Phillies of last year, as the team willing to spend? </b><br/>A: The Phillies again. I don’t know about $300 million, there’s only so many deals of the type you can do, but they are going to be aggressive. I think most teams will be strategic. The Phillies have pushed in this far, they did get much better last year, even if the wins and losses were disappointing. They are now at the point where it’s time to keep pushing the accelerator.</p>
      <p><b>Q: You hosted a GM roundtable at the GM meetings this week (airing Dec. 7). What did you learn? </b><br/>A: There is an art and a science about it, so we just really wanted to know how they went about the decision-making. What their life is like. And what we found is it’s all about putting out fires, putting fires out that you don’t expect. A lot of the guys what they have to do is non-baseball roster-related, it’s real-life decisions and people decisions.<br/><b><br/>Q: What did you take away from working with Joe Girardi for two years? </b><br/>A: Every conversation I had with Joe Girardi I learned something. He has a brilliant baseball mind, is extremely experienced. He is hyper-competent, the trains will run on time in Philadelphia. I think having two years off probably helps him, too. Having that job is such a pressure-cooker. He did 10 years with the Yankees, that’s a long run, think about how long that is in this day and age. Coming back refreshed with a new club will be a great thing.</p>
