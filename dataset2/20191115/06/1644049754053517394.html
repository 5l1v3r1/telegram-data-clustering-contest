      <p>The Philippines on Friday reported its first case of a vaping-linked illness, as health authorities expressed concern at court orders preventing them from regulating electronic cigarettes.</p>
      <p>A rash of vaping-linked deaths and illnesses in some countries has raised concern over the rising popularity of e-cigarettes, touted as less harmful than tobacco. India and some US states have banned e-cigarettes.</p>
      <p>A 16-year-old girl in the central Philippines who had been using e-cigarettes for six months was hospitalised last month for severe shortness of breath and met the criteria for vaping-related lung injury, the health department said.</p>
      <p>The girl was treated by a paediatric pulmonologist and discharged.</p>
      <p>“All e-cigarette users should seek immediate medical help, and ask their doctors for ways to quit these harmful products,” Health Undersecretary Enrique Domingo said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The health department last month ordered hospitals to document vaping-related cases and also drew up regulations.</p>
      <p>But the department has been sued over the planned regulations, which prevented the government from implementing them while the matter is in court.</p>
      <p>Domingo urged the courts to rule on the cases swiftly, adding: “As international evidence points out, every delay in regulating electronic cigarettes is a step back for public health.”</p>
      <p>E-cigarettes were initially touted as less damaging than tobacco, which causes around eight million deaths a year.</p>
      <p>However, concern about their effects has been growing and in July, the World Health Organization warned that electronic smoking devices were “undoubtedly harmful and should therefore be subject to regulation”.</p>
      <p>Apart from e-cigarette use, about four in 10 adult Filipino men and nearly six percent of women are tobacco users, a government survey showed.</p>
