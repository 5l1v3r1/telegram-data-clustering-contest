      <p>HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba is set to price its first share sale in Hong Kong next week, raising up to $13.4 billion in what will be the largest deal in the city since 2010 and the world’s biggest ever cross-border secondary listing.</p>

      <h3>WHY IS ALIBABA LISTING IN HONG KONG?</h3>
      <p>Analysts say establishing a base outside the United States gives the U.S.-listed company options, especially in the light of the U.S.-China trade dispute.</p>
      <p>It is an “escape valve listing”, said Travis Lundy, an analyst at Quiddity Advisors who publishes on SmartKarma.</p>
      <p>“Investors can take delivery or buy and sell shares (in Hong Kong) should U.S.-China relations worsen. This should be considered a non-negligible benefit for any U.S.-listed Chinese company,” he added.</p>
      <p>Alibaba, which is due to start trading on Nov. 26 in Hong Kong, could also benefit from Chinese demand.</p>
      <p>While it will not be eligible for trading until June in the Stock Connect that links Shanghai and Shenzhen with Hong Kong, analysts and investors expect demand from mainland mom-and-pop investors to lift its valuation.</p>
      <p>Alibaba’s Hong Kong deal is technically small versus its $476 billion market capitalization and it will dilute existing shareholder by just 2.8%, the company calculates. [nL4N27T2DL]</p>
      <h3>WHY NOT LIST IN SHANGHAI OR SHENZHEN?</h3>
      <p>Alibaba is essentially too big for its home market.</p>
      <p>China hosts the world’s No.2 pool of equity capital, but local share sales are usually much smaller than in Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>While Alibaba holds the record for the world’s biggest initial public offering, with its $25 billion New York listing in 2014 - pipping Hong Kong which hosted Agricultural Bank of China’s $22 billion deal in 2010, China’s biggest IPO in the past decade was the $7.3 billion float in 2009 of China State Construction Engineering Corp, Refinitiv data shows.</p>
      <p>Beijing is working to help fast-growing start-ups list at home as well as lure back those that got away, including Alibaba. This year it launched the STAR Market to host innovative earlier-stage companies under a less controlled, more Nasdaq-style listing system - a first for China. [nL4N2553XV]</p>
      <h3>WHY IS IT A BIG DEAL FOR HONG KONG?</h3>
      <p>Alibaba postponed its listing plans over the summer as political protests that began in June worsened.</p>
      <p>The company’s decision to push ahead now will be seen as a vote of confidence in Hong Kong’s financial future even as protests grow increasingly violent. [nL4N25H123][nL4N27U6PU]</p>
      <p>The listing is also the culmination of six-plus years of argument, consultations and rule changes that all stemmed from Alibaba’s decision in 2013 to list in New York, not Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>That was driven by the city’s refusal to ease its one-share-one-vote stance to accept Alibaba’s unusual governance, where a self-selecting group of company insiders control the majority of board seats.</p>
      <p>Many market participants felt being able to trade Alibaba alongside arch-rival Tencent would have encouraged other tech companies to follow suit - rebalancing Hong Kong’s reputation for hosting stodgy Chinese state-owned enterprises and local tycoon-controlled conglomerates.</p>
      <p>Last year, bourse operator Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing pushed through rules that allowed firms to list with different classes of shares, opening a path for tech giants listed elsewhere such as Alibaba to sell shares in the city.</p>
      <p>Alibaba is the first to do so, although others are expected to consider following the same path.</p>
