      <h1>Google Cancels Weekly All-Hands Meetings Amid Growing Workplace Tensions</h1>

      <p>An anonymous reader quotes a report from CNBC: <i>Google is getting rid of one of its best-known workplace features: TGIF, its weekly all-hands meeting. The company confirmed to CNBC that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/15/google-cancels-tgif-weekly-all-hands-meetings.html">it will instead hold monthly all-hands meetings</a> that will be focused on business and strategy while holding separate town halls for "workplace issues." An email announcing the change was previously <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/15/20966718/google-weekly-all-hands-tgif-staff-meeting-changes-ceo-sundar-pichai">reported by The Verge</a>. <br/><br/>Founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin started TGIFs in 1999 as a forum where employees could regularly express concerns and discuss topics open and freely with management. At that time, the company was small enough to fit in a meeting room, but the all-hands continued to grow as the employee base grew -- until recently, that is. Page and Brin stopped attending regularly in 2019. A company spokesperson said that the meetings had recently become a bi-weekly instead of weekly occurrence. The new model comes as the company cracks down on the open work culture that's long been part of its identity of holding free discussion. Employees have increasingly <a href="https://tech.slashdot.org/story/18/11/01/2146249/google-employees-stage-protest-over-handling-of-sexual-harassment">voiced their concerns</a> about everything from the handling of sexual harassment to government hires and contracts. In recent months, employees have leaked meeting notes to the media, which have shown growing tension between executives and workers.</i> "In other places -- like TGIF -- our scale is challenging us to evolve," Pichai said in a memo to employees this week. "TGIF has traditionally provided a place to come together, share progress, and ask questions, but it's not working in its current form." <br/><br/>"We're unfortunately seeing a coordinated effort to share our conversations outside of the company after every TGIF," the note reportedly states. "I know this is new information to many of you, and it has affected our ability to use TGIF as a forum for candid conversations on important topics."</p>
