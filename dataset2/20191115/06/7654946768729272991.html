      <p>DENVER — Just as they had two days earlier at Utah, the Nets wasted a red-hot first half with an ice-cold second half. And when it was over, they had lost, 101-93, to the Nuggets before 18,394 at Pepsi Center — their third straight defeat on the current five-game road trip.</p>
      <p>Though the Nets’ blowout loss at Phoenix was embarrassing, their last two were just galling. They didn’t learn from blowing a 15-point third quarter edge against the Jazz. Will they glean anything from flushing a 16-point cushion against the Nuggets?</p>
      <p>“Yeah, we have a bunch of games like that, where we’re just not getting over the hump right now,” said coach Kenny Atkinson, whose Nets are 1-3 on the trip when they easily could have flipped that if they had managed the endgames better.</p>
      <p>Granted, they’ll be playing without <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/14/nets-caris-levert-out-indefinitely-after-undergoing-thumb-surgery/">Caris LeVert for 4-6 weeks after thumb surgery</a>. And Kyrie Irving <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/14/why-the-nets-may-be-better-off-resting-kyrie-irving/">played through a right shoulder impingement</a>, totaling 17 points, nine assists and six rebounds.</p>
      <p>Jarrett Allen and Spencer Dinwiddie shared team high-scoring honors, with Allen also grabbing 10 rebounds. But everybody in a Nets uniform was running in quicksand for the entire second half.</p>
      <p>After scoring 61 points in the first half on 53.2 percent shooting, they mustered just 32 on 22.9 percent in the second.</p>
      <p>“It’s kind of a microcosm of our season,” Dinwiddie said.</p>
      <p>Nikola Jokic and Paul Millsap had 18 points each for Denver (7-3). But the Nets somehow got outscored 34-18 with Jokic on the bench for a run that spanned the third and fourth quarters.</p>
      <p>“We had a lead coming out of halftime, [but] coming down the stretch just couldn’t come with the basketball gods to make some of the shots,” said Irving, who wouldn’t use his shoulder as an alibi.</p>
      <p>“Just do the best you can,” Irving added. “It’s an 82-game season, do as much strengthening as you can. There’s not a lot of time on a 10-day road trip when you play every other day. But there are no excuses. I signed up for this as a kid.”</p>
      <p>With the Nets trailing 22-21, they closed out the first quarter with a 14-6 run to match their highest-scoring opening period of the season.</p>
      <p>Their previous high came the game before, at Utah, where they ended up blowing a fourth-quarter lead. The scenario replayed itself Thursday.</p>
      <p>Irving dished out a half-dozen assists in the first quarter and eight in the first half alone, without a single turnover. By the break, Brooklyn had 16 assists to just three turnovers, and was leading the Nuggets by 61-49.</p>
      <p>But the Nuggets started clambering back late in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>Leading 73-60 after an Irving basket, the Nets coughed up 10 unanswered points — eight of them after Jokic was subbed out of the game. Monte Morris’ 3-pointer cut the lead to 77-75, and Juancho Hernangomez knotted it on a layup with 1:15 in the third.</p>
      <p>The teams went into the fourth deadlocked at 79-all. They traded baskets until a Jerami Grant corner 3-pointer finally got Denver over the hump and into an 86-83 lead.</p>
      <p>The Nets had fallen behind 94-87 by the time Jokic returned to the floor with 5:20 to play, and they never caught up.</p>
      <p>“Once they tied the game 77-77 it was anyone’s game at that point, so you’ve just got to strap up your boots and be ready to play for the fourth quarter,” Irving said. “We’ve done that in spurts but when teams pick up their physicality we’ve just got to be able to respond and adjust.”</p>
