      <p>Israel launched fresh strikes against Islamic Jihad targets in the Gaza Strip, the Israeli army said early Friday, weakening a ceasefire put in place after fighting this week killed scores of Palestinians in exchanges of fire.<br/><br/>The ceasefire began Thursday morning following two days of deadly violence in the impoverished enclave triggered by an Israeli strike on Baha Abu al-Ata, an Islamic Jihad commander.<br/><br/>The Israeli army told reporters that new overnight strikes were underway on Islamic Jihad, the second most powerful Palestinian militant group in Gaza after the territory’s rulers Hamas.<br/><br/>It came after five rockets were fired at Israel from Gaza -- also after the ceasefire came into effect -- with two of them intercepted by air defenses, according to the army.<br/><br/>The Israeli army “views the violation of the ceasefire and rockets directed at Israel with great severity," it said in a news release.<br/><br/>Israel's military was prepared to "continue operating as necessary against all attempts to harm Israel civilians", it said.<br/><br/>Two injured citizens were being treated in hospital in the southern part of the territory, according to the health ministry in Gaza.<br/><br/>During the day on Thursday normal life had resumed quietly in Israeli regions near the Gaza border, while in Gaza, citizens had also embraced the return of relative calm.<br/><br/>Israel's military said some 450 rockets had been fired at its territory since Tuesday morning and air defenses had intercepted dozens of them in fireballs high in the sky.<br/><br/>No Israelis were killed, though one rocket narrowly missed speeding cars on a busy highway. Israeli medics said they had treated some 63 people as of Wednesday night for mild injuries and stress.<br/><br/>Israel responded with air strikes, saying it targeted more Islamic Jihad militant sites and rocket- and missile-launching squads.<br/><br/>Islamic Jihad has said several more of its members were among those killed in the fighting this week.<br/><br/>Palestinian officials said eight members of the same family, including five children, were killed in an Israeli strike in the central Gaza Strip.<br/><br/>Israel's military said the man targeted and killed in that strike was an Islamic Jihad rocket unit commander.<br/><br/>Relatives, neighburs and an Islamic Jihad spokesman disputed that he belonged to the group, with some saying he had previously worked as a Palestinian Authority (PA) military police officer.</p>
