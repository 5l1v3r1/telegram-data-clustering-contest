      <h1>The Stuart McCall tactical nous that can elevate Hearts as former Rangers boss tipped for success</h1>
      <h2>Lee Erwin believes his former gaffer and the Tynecastle side are the perfect fit for each other.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T06:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Gordon Parks, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/gordon-parks/</a></address>
      <p>Lee Erwin believes <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ann-budge">Ann Budge</a> would be missing a trick if Stuart McCall isn’t sitting top of her Tynecastle wanted list.</p>
      <p>The ex-<a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/motherwell-fc">Motherwell</a> striker is convinced a managerial pairing of his old boss and Kenny Black tick every box both in terms of Premiership experience and bringing youth to the fore.</p>
      <p>McCall held talks with the Jambos board this week and is now firm favourite to succeed Craig Levein.</p>
      <p>And Erwin, who enjoyed a dressing room’s eye view of a dynamic duo who made the Fir Park side Scotland’s second force between 2012-2014, said: “There are some interesting names in the frame for Hearts but I’ll always be biased about <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/stuart-mccall">Stuart McCall</a> as I know just how good a manager he is.</p>
      <p>“He’s taken a few hits recently down south at Bradford and Scunthorpe but that doesn’t detract from a CV that’s as good as anyone’s in Scottish football over recent years.</p>
      <p>“<a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a> would be getting a superb management team if they went with Stuart and Kenny. What they achieved at Motherwell is proof of that. What makes them so effective is the honesty they bring to their work. They are hard but fair and maybe that’s a quality which could be effective at a club like Hearts at the moment.</p>

      <p>“It’s the blood and thunder they have as a duo but they are also very approachable.</p>
      <p>“I was a young kid at Fir Park and Stuart would take time to speak to me about my game, daily chats so he kept pushing me to be the best I could be.</p>
      <p>“It was the same with all the boys at the club. It was the atmosphere they created. You could discuss things and he would always bring things out into the open.</p>
      <p>“That ensured nothing was allowed to get in the way of what we were trying to do.”</p>
      <p>McCall managed to steer Well to consecutive second-place finishes, even getting the club into the Champions League.</p>
      <p>It was during season 2014-15 that Ross County hitman Erwin made his first start for the Fir Park club and admits the lines of communication stopped.</p>
      <p>He said: “We had played a Europa League game against Stjarnan and I was on the bench. The next game was against St Mirren and the manager didn’t name the team on the Friday which he usually did.</p>
      <p>“Not a word was said to me all week then came the Saturday and he read out the starting line-up and I was in.</p>

      <p>“There was no warning and that was his plan. He didn’t want me to overthink the game leading up to it – and it worked as I scored the only goal of the game. That’s an example of the man management he’s so good at.</p>
      <p>“Stuart and Kenny can be hard men to please. They are animated in the dugout and leave you with no doubt what they want from you. But that clear instruction is what all players need. I thrived on it.</p>
      <p>“Stuart’s week building up the game would be meticulous in a tactics sense.</p>
      <p>“Everything would be planned and nothing would be left to chance. They would analyse everything and if there was a young player doing well then they’d get their reward.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Hearts have a group of kids who had been doing brilliantly last season but some of them have faded from the first-team picture.</p>
      <p>“What Stuart does is show patience with kids. He wouldn’t just put them in and take them back out, he would persevere and give them a prolonged run.</p>
      <p>“Both he and Kenny took a huge interest in the youth at Motherwell and would be at all the games and Hearts are a club, which appears to want to promote their own players so it’s a perfect fit.</p>
      <p>“If Hearts appoint Stuart they’ll be getting a winner as a manager, someone who has worked with Scotland and achieved so much at Motherwell which maybe he doesn’t get the credit he deserved for.</p>
      <p>“He maybe stayed too long but he’d be the ideal man for Hearts at the ideal time.”</p>
