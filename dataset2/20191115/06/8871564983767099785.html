      <h1>Singapore PM, ‘Lee Dynasty’ attacked on vandalized DBS Bank in Hong Kong</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T06:16:48+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 06:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Singapore" target="_blank">Coconuts Singapore</a></address>
      <p>Singaporean politics were imported into Hong Kong, where a DBS Bank was vandalized with graffiti targeting prime minister Lee Hsien Loong, his ruling political party, and family. </p>
      <p>Photos of the bank outlet spray-painted with the words “Lee Hsien Loong piss off,” “F*** the [People’s Action Party],” and “F*** the Lee Dynasty,” were posted to the <i>Concerned Citizens Band Together for a Better Singapore</i> Facebook group yesterday, where they were reshared nearly 2,000 times. </p>
      <p>Hong Kong newspaper <i>South China Morning Post</i> referred to the “<a href="https://www.scmp.com/article/547812/lee-dynasty-singapore">Lee dynasty</a>” as composed of the late former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, and his two sons — current PM Lee Hsien Loong and his brother Lee Hsien Yang. </p>
      <p>“[I] think Singaporean[s] better don’t travel to HK for the time being,” said the user who <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/gahmenstealspatentfromgooddoctor/permalink/1434205553423773/">posted them</a>, Wilson Welden. A friend in Hong Kong had shared the photos with him, he said. </p>
      <p>A second photo he posted showed a closer look at the graffiti. </p>

      <p>DBS Bank <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/dbs-branch-in-hong-kong-vandalised-with-vulgarities-directed-at-pm-lee-hsien-loong">told the press</a> yesterday the graffiti was removed as soon as it was discovered Thursday morning.</p>
      <p>Many in Hong Kong have been unhappy with Singapore’s prime minister for dismissive remarks he made at the Forbes Global CEO Conference last month. </p>
      <p>Speaking about <a href="http://www.coconuts.co/hongkong">Hong Kong’s protest movement</a>, Lee said its demands “are not demands which are meant to be a program to solve Hong Kong’s problems” but “demands intended to humiliate and bring down the government,” according to <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/dbs-branch-in-hong-kong-vandalised-with-vulgarities-directed-at-pm-lee-hsien-loong"><i>The Straits Times</i></a>. </p>
      <p>On Tuesday night, flames engulfed a shop right next to another DBS Branch in Hong Kong.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/jjameswisely/videos/2836191059748829/">Videos of the fire </a>show the blaze spreading to the ceiling in front of the bank across from a large crowd and what look to be several rioters picking up bricks in the street. Someone attempts to put out the blaze with an extinguisher until a fire truck rolls up. </p>

      <p>No bank employees were injured and the bank was undamaged, a spokesperson said Tuesday. The incident reportedly took place on Yee Wo Street in Causeway Bay.</p>
      <p>The streets of Hong Kong have been marred by months of spiraling protests sparked by a now-scrapped extradition bill that have since widened into broader calls for political reform.</p>
