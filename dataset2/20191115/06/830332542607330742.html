      <p>BERLIN - Europe's largest economy narrowly avoided a recession in the third quarter, expanding by 0.1% over the previous three-month period.</p>
      <p>Still, the outlook for Germany remains poor.</p>
      <p>Here's what Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, gleaned from the data:</p>
      <p>"The trivial increase in GDP in Q3 means that Germany has narrowly averted a technical recession. But second-quarter GDP fell more than previously thought, and we think the economy will probably contract slightly next year -- so a recession may have been postponed rather than avoided altogether," he said.</p>
