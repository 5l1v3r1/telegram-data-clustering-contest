      <p>Former Zinara Finance Director Simon Mudzingwa Taranhike has been jailed for 15 months after being found guilty of criminal abuse of office.</p>
      <p>Harare regional magistrate Mr Hosea Mujaya initially sentenced Taranhike to 30 months in prison before suspending 6 months on condition of good behaviour. Another 9 months were suspended on condition that Taranhike restitutes 1 800 litres of fuel to Zinara before December 31 2019.</p>
      <p>In passing sentence, Mr Mujaya said he took into consideration that Taranhike is a first offender and a family man. Mr Mujaya said it is true that Taranhike did not directly benefit from the commission of the offence. He further stated that Taranhike lost his job as a result of the offence.</p>
      <p>Mr Mujaya, however, said the court cannot turn a blind eye on corrupt activities and should pass an exemplary sentence.</p>
