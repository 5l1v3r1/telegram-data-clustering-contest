      <h1>Teenager on apprentice wage reveals she's been sofa surfing after finding herself homeless at 17</h1>
      <h2>She spoke about living "out of bags" and not feeling welcome at places she'd stayed temporarily</h2>

      <p>Teenager Ellie Duggan says she's had to resort to sofa surfing because her apprentice wage and what she receives on Universal Credit have left her struggling to find an affordable place to live.</p>
      <p>She's been left technically homeless, saying she was forced to leave her family home in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/clifton">Clifton</a> last December, two days before her 18th birthday.</p>
      <p>She lived with her grandma and Ms Duggan explained her mum died when she was a child and that she'd had limited contact with her dad.</p>
      <p>Her grandma fell ill, and later died, and Ms Duggan found herself without a roof over her head.</p>
      <p>"I just felt like my head was a little bit of a mess. I didn't think about it that much, I just went on," she said.</p>
      <p>"I did what I had to do and came to work."</p>
      <p>Between December and February she moved from place to place, saying: "Sometimes one week I'd stay in one place a couple of nights and then half way through the week at another place.</p>
      <p>"Or I'd take some clothes to work and then I'd always have my suitcase in one house."</p>
      <p>She spoke of living "out of bags" and not feeling welcome at places she'd stayed temporarily.</p>
      <p>She began to claim Universal Credit and moved into a shared house in Colwick Road, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/historic-nottingham-building-damaged-after-3536837">West Bridgford</a>.</p>
      <p>Ms Duggan initially received more than £500 each month, in addition to her wages, and stayed in the property from February until August.</p>
      <p>However, her payments were lowered because she officially declared she was earning in June, working as a receptionist for a recruitment company on an apprentice wage. She was forced to leave the property as the payments dropped. She received £77.77 on July 6.</p>
      <p>She was helped by a colleague to pay her last rent installment and she's found herself back to square one, sofa surfing again.</p>
      <p>"Since I've been homeless again, I've been to the doctor's and they prescribed me with anti-depressants," said Ms Duggan, who works for Express Recruitment, based locally in Eldon Chambers, near <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/">Old Market Square</a>.</p>

      <p>She has been staying with a cousin in Clifton and with her sister in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/">Sutton-in-Ashfield</a>.</p>
      <p>Ms Duggan has launched a Homelink application, a process in a bid to secure affordable, suitable accommodation.</p>
      <p>Homelink deals with social housing - but Ms Duggan could also be offered private-rented accommodation.</p>
      <p>"It's literally all I want now. It would mean everything, just to have my own space," said Ms Duggan.</p>
      <p>Ms Duggan left school with a handful of GCSEs.</p>
      <p>After initially becoming homeless, she was put in contact with Lesley Beauchamp, managing director of Express Recruitment, who has been a pillar of support in helping Ms Duggan get back on her feet.</p>
      <p>Ms Beauchamp said: "I just thought 'I think this girl needs a chance in life'.</p>

      <p>"I gave her a week's trial and said 'see if you like it'. (I said) 'I want you to do your NVQ'.</p>
      <p>"She needed it on her CV. I'm in recruitment, I know. I've been her bridge over troubled water.</p>
      <p>"I've always been a great advocator of getting people education and qualifications.</p>
      <p>"I do fervently believe that education is the way towards a career and prospects." Ms Duggan is studying towards a level three NVQ in business administration and is also thinking about possibly going to university in the future.</p>
      <p>A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: “Ms Duggan’s benefit payments varied after taking into account the wages she received each month.</p>
      <p>"We have contacted her to explain this and ensure she is getting the correct support.</p>
      <p>“If people think their earnings have been reported incorrectly by their employer, they can provide additional evidence to HMRC.”</p>
      <p>A Nottingham City Council spokesman said: "Almost a year ago our Housing Aid staff advised Ms Duggan to claim for Universal Credit and subsequently raised concerns with her about the affordability of the property she was moving into, as it was above the usual rate for a person of her age.</p>
      <p>“This September she re-approached us and we have created a personal housing plan for her based on assessments of her housing and support needs.</p>
      <p>"This sets out some actions that both the council and Ms Duggan can take to resolve her housing situation.</p>
      <p>“We have advised Ms Duggan about looking for alternative private rented accommodation, and to apply to Homelink which would mean we can ask for a reasonable preference criteria be awarded to her as a homeless household.</p>
      <p>"We will help to negotiate with landlords to secure a property if she is able to find one and continue to work with Ms Duggan to try to resolve her housing situation. It’s likely that any offer that is made will be in the private sector.”</p>
