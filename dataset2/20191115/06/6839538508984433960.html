      <p>Nearly a dozen cheeses made by popular Hahndorf cheesemaker Udder Delights are being recalled over fears of E.coli.</p>
      <p>Some of its most popular cheeses, including its 200g camembert and brie are being recalled. The SA company said there was no evidence the form of E.coli found was dangerous but it was recalling them as a precaution.</p>
      <p>The cheeses are available from Coles and independent retailers in SA, Queensland, Victoria and WA. In NSW they also sell at Woolies and in Tasmania they are sold at independent retailers.</p>
      <p>Udder Delights chef executive Sheree Sullivan said the team was “devastated” after small levels of the bacteria were found in some of the company’s white mould 200g cheeses.</p>
      <p>“It is with a very heavy heart that Udder Delights is doing its first voluntary recall since we began 20 years ago,” Ms Sullivan said.</p>
      <p>“The whole team is devastated, because we all just work so hard to create a really high quality product.</p>
      <p>“You always learn some of your best lessons through disasters, and I never really understood what a voluntary recall was. It means you have a choice - do you want to recall or not? We decided as a business we wanted to be 100 per cent sure it was safe.</p>
      <p>“It was great SA Health and Dairysafe confirmed it wasn’t a dangerous bacteria, which can sometimes be a little bit of sunshine in a dark cloud.”</p>
      <p>Ms Sullivan would not speculate on what caused the contamination, but said they were working with SA Health and their quality assurance team to quickly resolve the issue.</p>
      <p>“We’re waiting for all their findings because they’re the experts. I know it’s a common bacteria... a tiny bit is normal,” she said.</p>
      <p>“What we’re doing is analysing any new procedure we’ve introduced to see, is that where the gap is?”</p>
      <p>The health department’s protection and licensing services executive director Dr Chris Lease said the recall was precautionary and affected products were being removed from sale.</p>
      <p>“During routine testing, three products were found to exceed the allowable limits of E.coli and therefore the decision has been made to recall all products produced during the same production period,” Dr Lease said.</p>
      <p>“We have no evidence that the form of E.coli present is dangerous, however the businesses decided to initiate a recall.”</p>
      <p>The full recall includes the following products with Best Before dates of 29JAN20 up to and including 05FEB20:</p>
      <p>• Udder Delights camembert 200g</p>
