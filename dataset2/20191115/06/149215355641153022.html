      <p>Federal prosecutors are now looking into whether Rudy Giuliani, President Trump's personal lawyer, failed to register as a foreign agent and violated campaign finance laws, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-15/giuliani-faces-u-s-probe-on-campaign-finance-lobbying-breaches?srnd=premium">three U.S. officials told <i>Bloomberg News</i>.</a></p>
      <p>The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/871728/report-federal-prosecutors-investigating-giulianis-ukrainian-business-dealings">reportedly began investigating Giuliani</a> and his dealings in Ukraine after they launched a probe into two of his business associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman. Last month, Parnas and Fruman were <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/870992/giuliani-associates-arrested-before-planned-oneway-flight-prosecutors-say">arrested</a> and charged with illegally funneling foreign money into U.S. campaigns.

      <p>Several top State Department officials have testified during the House impeachment inquiry that earlier this year, Giuliani was running a shadow campaign when it came to Ukraine. They said he <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/878190/state-department-official-george-kent-calls-rudy-giuliani-attempting-smear-colleagues">spread rumors</a> to force out then-Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, and was searching for any information that could damage Trump's potential political rivals.</p>
      <p>Based on what they know about the matter, one U.S. official told <i>Bloomberg News</i> it is possible prosecutors could charge Giuliani with violating laws against bribing foreign officials or conspiracy. "I would not be surprised if he gets indicted," former federal prosecutor Mimi Rocah told <i>Bloomberg News</i>. "It's clear Giuliani is up to his ears in shady stuff and there's tons of smoke."</p>
