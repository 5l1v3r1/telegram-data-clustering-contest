      <h1>Myles Garrett after helmet-swing fiasco: ‘I lost my cool. It’s on me’</h1>

      <p>Myles Garrett is instantly regretting his helmet-swinging actions.</p>
      <p>The defensive end ripped off Pittsburgh quarterback Mason Rudolph’s helmet and <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/myles-garrett-uses-helmet-to-clock-mason-rudolphs-head-in-fight/">hit him with it in the head</a> in the final seconds as the Browns’ 21-7 win over the Steelers on Thursday night ended with a wild brawl between the rivals.</p>
      <p>Garrett faces a likely suspension, and Steelers center Maurkice Pouncey likely will be disciplined for kicking Garrett in the head.</p>
      <p>“I lost my cool and I regret it,” Garrett said. “It’s going to come back to hurt our team. The guys who jumped into the scrum, I appreciate my team having my back, but it never should have gotten to that point. It’s on me.”</p>
      <p>After the game, Baker Mayfield ripped into Garrett, calling his actions <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/baker-mayfield-tears-into-helmet-swinging-myles-garrett-inexcusable/">“inexcusable.”</a></p>
