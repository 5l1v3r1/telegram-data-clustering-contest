      <h1>Micron intros 1TB microSD card for cloud-managed video surveillance</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T06:14:04+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 06:14</time> by <a rel="author">Jessie Shen, DIGITIMES, Taipei</a></address>
      <p>Micron Technology has unveiled what the company claims is the world's highest-capacity industrial microSD card, the Micron i300 microSDXC UHS-I series, which is offered in 128GB to 1TB capacities.</p>
      <p>The new Micron i300 1TB microSD card is based on Micron's advanced 96-layer 3D quad-level cell (QLC) NAND technology, making it cheaper for small- to medium-sized deployments to have primary storage in the camera compared to a centralized storage architecture. The i300 microSD card enables users of video surveillance systems to capture and store more than three months of high-quality video footage on-device and at the edge.</p>
      <p>VSaaS systems are increasingly integrating artificial intelligence-based and higher-resolution cameras that require more storage at the edge. Micron claimed its new i300 1TB microSDXC card allows 24/7 continuous capture and storage of up to 1TB of high-quality video in the camera. Users of video surveillance systems can now store large amounts of video footage on-device, opening a broader set of uses for cloud-managed solutions.</p>
      <p>The rising adoption of VSaaS by small to medium businesses and enterprises is attributed to lower overhead costs achieved through ease of installation and elimination of the need for on-site NVRs and DVRs, Micron indicated. The ability to store large video footage files in the camera and at the edge reduces the demand for network bandwidth and expenditure associated with continuous cloud storage. These savings contribute to lowering the overall cost of ownership for businesses while bringing flexibility and scalability associated with cloud-based implementation models.</p>
      <p>Micron's industrial-grade microSD portfolio is designed to endure the harsh environments in which surveillance systems are deployed. The Micron i300 1TB microSDXC card minimizes frame drops in a 24/7, 30 frames per second (FPS) recording environment, offering twice the reliability of hard disk drives at 2 million hours mean time to failure. The card features a smart tool for monitoring the health of devices.</p>
      <p>"Micron's i300 industrial-grade microSD cards for edge storage open the possibility for a broad range of video surveillance as a service deployments that no longer require local network video recorders," said Amit Gattani, senior director of segment marketing in Micron's embedded BU. "Micron's 96-layer 3D QLC NAND is instrumental in helping us deliver 1TB of storage in a microSD form factor and at a breakthrough price point to accelerate edge storage and cloud-based service models."</p>
      <p>"The video surveillance market is quickly shifting toward hybrid cloud architectures that store video footage on-camera, allowing secure access via cloud-based software," said Raj Misra, director of hardware engineering at Verkada. "Micron extending its range of reliable industrial-grade microSD cards to 1TB enables us to provide our customers with industry-leading data retention, security and video resolution options at very cost-effective price points."</p>
      <p>"Vivotek has launched a series of edge-computing network cameras and successfully deployed Micron's high-quality industrial-grade microSD cards," said Shengfu Cheng, company director of marketing and product development. "Micron's portfolio of industrial microSD cards up to 1TB equips us to deliver greater flexibility, scalability and maintenance efficiency to our customers, all of which contribute to a better return on investment."</p>
