      <p>Apple has released a firmware update for the new AirPods Pro.<br/><br/>When the AirPods Pro first shipped they were running firmware version 2B584. Today, Apple pushed out firmware version 2B588. Unfortunately, there are no release notes for the firmware update but it likely brings performance and reliability improvements.<br/><br/>Although you can't manually initiate a firmware update, you can check the version of your connected AirPods by visiting Settings &gt; General &gt; About &gt; [AirPods Name].<br/><br/>If you're looking to purchase AirPods Pro, Amazon is selling them at a $14.02 discount today.
