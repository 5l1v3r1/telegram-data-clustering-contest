      <p>LUXEMBOURG CITY - The European Investment Bank (EIB) announced Thursday that it will end financing for fossil fuel energy projects at the end of 2021, adding in a statement that future financing will focus on accelerating<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/24/business/climate-change-equinor-oil-investors/index.html"> innovations in clean energy</a>.</p>
      <p>"We will stop financing fossil fuels and we will launch the most ambitious climate investment strategy of any public financial institution anywhere," EIB President Werner Hoyer said Thursday.</p>
      <p>The EIB is the European Union's lending arm. Its new energy lending policy will "unlock 1 trillion euros of climate action and environmental sustainable investment" in order to enable energy decarbonisation, and meet a 32% renewable energy share throughout the European Union by 2030.</p>
      <p>"Climate is the top issue on the political agenda of our time...The EU bank has been Europe's climate bank for many years. Today it has decided to make a quantum leap in its ambition," Hoyer added.</p>
      <p>EIB Vice-President Andrew McDowell also called for urgent action to counter the<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/23/business/drax-power-station/index.html"> rise in carbon emission</a>, outlining the EU bank's plans to "drive global efforts" to reduce dependence on carbon energy.</p>
      <p>"The EIB's ambitious energy lending policy adopted today is a crucial milestone in the fight against global warming...we have reached a compromise to end the financing by the EU Bank of unabated fossil fuel projects, including gas, from the end of 2021," McDowell added.</p>
