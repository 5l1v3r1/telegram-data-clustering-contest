      <p>Amazon.com Inc will protest a recent cloud computing contract award given to Microsoft Corp by the Pentagon, The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday.</p>
      <p>REUTERS: Amazon.com Inc will protest the Pentagon's decision to award a US$10 billion cloud computing contract to Microsoft Corp , the Wall Street Journal reported (https://on.wsj.com/2CLjsdK) on Thursday, citing a statement.</p>
      <p>Amazon did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.</p>

      <p>A challenge to the Defense Department's award announced last month was widely expected by legal experts, analysts and consultants, especially after President Donald Trump publicly derided Amazon's bid for the high-stakes contract.</p>
      <p>Trump had said in August that Amazon's bid for the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud (JEDI) contract was under review by his administration after complaints from other companies.</p>
      <p>Amazon was considered a favorite for the contract, part of a broader digital modernization process of the Pentagon, before Microsoft emerged as the surprise winner.</p>
