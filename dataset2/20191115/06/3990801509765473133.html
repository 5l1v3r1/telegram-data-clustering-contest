      <h1>India may have another crack at soft landing on the moon in 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T06:48:19+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 06:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenextweb.com/author/ivanmehta/" target="_blank">Ivan Mehta</a></address>
      <p>In Septemeber, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) tried to be a part of history by <a href="https://thenextweb.com/in/2019/09/09/what-happened-to-indias-chandrayaan-2-moon-mission/">attempting a soft landing on the moon with Chandrayaan-2</a>.</p>
      <p>Sadly, before the Vikram lander reached the lunar surface, the team lost communication with it. Later, <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-happened-to-chandrayaan-2-lander-nasa-may-offer-clues/story-ueSuKsM1eWvtbgworG9rWM.html">the lander was located</a>, but scientists were not able to establish any contact with it.</p>
      <p>However, India will have another crack at achieving a soft landing soon. According to a report by <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/india-may-again-attempt-soft-landing-on-moon-next-november-with-chandrayaan-3-6119351/">PTI</a>, the space agency is already working on Chandryaan-3 and aims to launch it by November 2020.</p>
      <p>ISRO has commissioned a report from a committee led by S Somanath, the director of Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, which is responsible for all launch vehicle programs. A senior ISRO official told PTI that the agency is waiting for the report, and there’s a possible launch window in November next year: </p>
      <blockquote>The panel’s report is awaited. The committee has been given a guideline to prepare the mission before the end of next year. There is a good launch window in November.</blockquote>
      <p>A report from <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/chandrayaan-3-second-bid-to-land-on-moon-by-november-2020/articleshow/72047390.cms">Times of India</a> suggests ISRO has held four high-level meetings since October to plan the mission. The report notes the space agency will focus on building only a lander and a rover as Chandrayaan-2’s orbiter still functions. It’ll also look to strengthen the legs of the lander so it can brace the impact with the lunar surface.</p>
