      <h1>White House Unveils Rules Requiring Online Disclosure of Hospital Prices</h1>

      <p><a href="https://science.slashdot.org/~schwit1">schwit1</a> shares a report from The Hill: <i>The Trump administration on Friday <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/470620-white-house-unveils-rules-requiring-online-disclosure-of-hospital-prices">unveiled new rules to require increased disclosure of health care prices</a>, in a move officials said would drive down costs by increasing competition. One regulation would require hospitals to provide a consumer-friendly online page where prices are listed for 300 common procedures like X-rays and lab tests. A second regulation would require insurers to provide an online tool where people could compare their out-of-pocket costs at different medical providers before receiving treatment. The rule announced Friday affecting hospitals is a final rule, set to take effect Jan. 1, 2021. The rule for insurers is still a proposal that is not yet finalized. </i><i>"Hospitals and insurers will fight this. The last thing they want is consumers price shopping," adds schwit1.</i></p>
