      <h2>What does it take to rack up two wins and four podiums in the Modified Harley-Davidson class at the AMD World Championships? Whatever it is, the German builder Julian von Oheimb has got it in spades.</h2>

      <p>Julian operates as One Way Machine out of his workshop in Staufenberg, north of Frankfurt. And this is the machine that bagged him his second gold. Called “Silver Storm,” it’s a custom Softail Deuce built with the sole purpose of competing at AMD.</p>
      <p>The search for an AMD win started with a search for a suitable donor. Julian managed to find an extremely clean 2001 Softail Deuce FXSTD in a backyard garage, with roughly 2 000 miles on the clock. Bingo.</p>

      <p>The Softail went onto the One Way Machine bench, and was promptly stripped down to its bare bones. Julian worked his way through the frame and swing arm – cleaning them up and shaving off any tabs, struts and mounts that did not need to be there any more.</p>
      <p>To massage the Softail’s stance, Julian installed an Arlen Ness lowering kit at the rear. He kept the OEM front forks, but swapped the yokes for a set of Harley Sportster Forty-Eight units.</p>
      <p>A new 21F/18R wheel set was laced up using H-D hubs, W&amp;W rims and TTS spokes, with a vintage Firestone tyre up front, and a new Shinko out back. Other tweaks included a full Beringer brake set, and a One Way Machine chain drive conversion.</p>

      <p>Moving to the 1450cc Twin Cam motor, Julian treated the primary cover to an extremely cool cutaway mod. Then he added a set of RSD covers, complete with windows that show off all the working bits.</p>
      <p>A new Paugho air cleaner went on too, with a custom ignition coil cover adorning the opposite side of the engine. The two-into-one stainless steel exhaust system is a one-off, and terminates in a sportbike muffler that Julian sourced specifically for the project.</p>
      <p>The bodywork is a mixed bag of new and old. While rummaging through his storage, Julian found a 1950s Hercules fuel tank that suited the concept he had in his head perfectly. So he cleaned it up, and modified it to fit the bike by hand shaping a new tunnel and fabricating new tank mounts.</p>
      <p>He added a new filler mouth too, finishing it off with a hood ornament style cap that he procured from a Polish metal sculptor. And he fitted custom-made “OWM” badges to the sides.</p>

      <p>Spirit Leather supplied the seat, custom-made to Julian’s design. It features subtle blue contrast stitching, and an “OWM” logo under the back section. It is also lined with a set of holes – a design that Julian has echoed on other pieces, like the custom-made battery cover and modified oil tank.</p>
      <p>The rear fender is an edited aftermarket unit. It is held up by an elaborate, yet elegant, single-sided bracket system that has been built from scratch.</p>
      <p>The Softail Deuce now wears a set of LSL handlebars, with grips and foot pegs from Rough Crafts and controls from Beringer. There is also a small, vintage-style headlight up front, and a neat analogue speedo from Motogadget nestled where the stock top bar riser has been cut away.</p>
      <p>There are a whole lot of smaller hand-made parts too, but they are hard to spot. Take a closer look at the side stand, the fuel tap and those little wheel axle finishing bits. Flawless, all of them.</p>

      </p>
      <p>But where Silver Storm really shines, is in her finishes. The bodywork has not been polished, but rather painted in a special mirror chrome paint.</p>
      <p>There is grey paint on the frame, and a mix of matt and polished bits throughout the build. Add it all up, and you end with a monochromatic vision that your eyes can get lost in.</p>
      <p>It is clear that Julian pulled no punches here, going all in to deliver a stunning contender. He has told us as much, confessing that he has probably poured more time and money into this custom Softail than any of his older builds.</p>
