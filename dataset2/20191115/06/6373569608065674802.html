      <p>Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis has revealed a simple way to make £175 this Christmas.</p>
      <p>The easy hack involves switching banks to make money, and latest MSE newsletter has pointed out that you can make £175 in time for Christmas - but only if you act quickly, <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/uk-news/martin-lewis-make-money-christmas-17254687">Manchester Evening News</a> reports.</p>
      <p>"Switching only takes seven working days, and with most, you can get the bonus within a month of that," Martin said.</p>
      <p>"That's about 40 days, meaning it's still possible to bag the cash before 25 December, though even if you don't quite make that date, you'll have it to ease the Jan squeeze - when the gap between paydays is long."</p>

      <p>HSBC Advance is currently offering a free £175 to anybody who switches, and the maximum wait to receive the payout is 40 days, so if you switch today in theory you should have it before 25 December.</p>
      <p>M&amp;S Bank is also giving £100 free gift cards to customers who switch to their bank accounts, and this also has a maximum wait time of 40 days.</p>
