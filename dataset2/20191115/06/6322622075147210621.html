      <h1>Amazon challenges Pentagon's $10-billion cloud award to Microsoft</h1>

      <p>WASHINGTON (Nov 15): Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) on Thursday said it is contesting the Pentagon’s award of an up to $10 billion cloud computing deal to Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), expressing concern that politics got in the way of a fair contracting process.</p>
      <p>The company filed notice last Friday that it will formally protest the decision on the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud, known as JEDI. In a company-wide meeting on Thursday, Amazon Web Services’ CEO Andy Jassy said it would be challenging for a U.S. agency to award a contract objectively when the president is disparaging one of the contestants, according to an Amazon spokesman.</p>
      <p>President Donald Trump has long criticized Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos.</p>
      <p>The company confirmed Jassy’s comments and said, “Numerous aspects of the JEDI evaluation process contained clear deficiencies, errors, and unmistakable bias- and it’s important that these matters be examined and rectified.”</p>
      <p>The Federal Times earlier reported the news.</p>
      <p>A challenge to the Defense Department’s award announced last month was widely expected by legal experts, analysts and consultants, especially after Trump publicly derided Amazon’s bid for the high-stakes contract.</p>
      <p>Trump had said in August that Amazon’s bid for the JEDI contract was under review by his administration after complaints from other companies.</p>
      <p>Amazon was considered a favorite for the contract, part of a broader digital modernization process of the Pentagon, before Microsoft emerged as the surprise winner.</p>
