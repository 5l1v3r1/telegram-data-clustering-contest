      <p>In a public poll, his goal received 48% of the vote to see him beat off efforts from Derby County's Graham Shinnie and Hull City striker Tom Eaves to win the award..</p>
      <p>Receiving the award, Barkhuizen said: It's nice to get recognition personally, it was a great game to get a goal like that in and thankfully it got us the three points.</p>
      <p>"The most important thing for me is that we are second in the league. If I am doing well and contributing then it is only going to help that.</p>
      <p>“It was a nice goal, I don't score many like that so hopefully there are more to come!</p>

      <p>"The goal was made better by the whole day and the game, the way it panned out.</p>
      <p>"We were really poor in the first half and then we came out fighting in the second half and I think that goal topped off a really good afternoon for the whole place.</p>
      <p>"Once we got back in to the game, the whole place lifted, the fans lifted and it lifted us.</p>
      <p>"I think a goal like that comes from confidence of the game and it is always nice."</p>
      <p>Lead Sky Bet EFL goal of the month judge and Sky Sports Pundit Don Goodman, said: "It wasn’t only the quality of the goal that made Tom Barkhuizen’s late effort</p>
      <p>against local rivals Blackburn so special, but what it meant in the context of the game.</p>
      <p>"Barkhuizen had already been instrumental in bringing the scores level from 2-0 down and to keep calm and deliver such a perfectly-hit first time strike into the top</p>
      <p>corner to win the game, shows what a huge asset he is to Preston."</p>
      <p>It is the second time Barkhuizen has won this award, having done so in March 2017 for a goal against Reading.</p>
