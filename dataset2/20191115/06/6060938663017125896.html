      <p>There seems to be no halt for National Award winner <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ayushmann-Khurrana">Ayushmann Khurrana</a> as the actor is giving back to back blockbusters at the silver screen since the last few years. With 'Bala' becoming his career-best opener in the domestic circuit, Ayushmann took to social media to share the first look of his character from '<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Shubh-Mangal-Zyada-Saavdhan">Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan</a>'.</p>
      <p>Not only that but the film is a sequel of 2017 blockbuster 'Shubh Mangal Saavdhan' which dealt with the topic of erectile dysfunction, this sequel will revolve around the love story of a same-sex couple. Taking to Twitter, Ayushmann shared the first poster of himself and wrote, "Bhaagte Bhagate aa rahe hain hum, #ShubhMangalZyadaSaavdhan ðŸ‘¬- Releasing on 21st FEB 2020"</p>

      <p>The Hitesh Kewalya directorial which was earlier slated to release on 13th March next year is now preponed and would hit the big screens on 21st February. Producer <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Bhushan-Kumar">Bhushan Kumar</a> has interchanged the release date of Ayushmann's 'Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan' with his Anurag Basuâ€™s untitled next as both are being produced by him and the makers want the film to release early as its a complete family film and therefore they want the audience to see it as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>Talking about this move, Kumar said, "We are interchanging both the release dates of our films - 'Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan' and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Anurag-Basu">Anurag Basu</a>'s next. Aanand ji and Anurag both have been very supportive with the change. Both our films are interesting and cater to families across all ages. We are ready to give our audiences a complete adventurous ride with both these films."</p>
      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Jeetendra">Jeetendra</a> Kumar has been roped in to play Ayushmannâ€™s love interest in the film and it would also bring back the hit pair of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Neena-Gupta">Neena Gupta</a> and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Gajraj-Rao">Gajraj Rao</a>, who garnered a lot of applause for their stellar performance in 'Badhaai Ho'.
