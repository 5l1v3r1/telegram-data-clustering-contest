      <p>Portugal captain Cristiano Ronaldo scored another hat-trick, moving closer to 100 international goals, as he led the European champions to a 6-0 drubbing of Lithuania in a Euro 2020 qualifier on Thursday.</p>
      <p>FARO, Portugal: Portugal captain Cristiano Ronaldo scored another hat-trick, moving closer to 100 international goals, as he led the European champions to a 6-0 drubbing of Lithuania in a Euro 2020 qualifier on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo, whose hat-trick was the 55th of his career and ninth for Portugal, has 98 goals and could become only the second player to score a century for his country after Iran's Ali Daei.</p>

      <p>Pizzi, Goncalo Paciencia and Bernardo Silva shared the other goals in the one-sided Group B match.</p>
      <p>The defending champions, however, were left waiting to confirm their place at next year's finals after Serbia beat Luxembourg 3-2. Portugal are second with 14 points, one ahead of Serbia, and will qualify if they win in Luxembourg on Sunday. Leaders Ukraine have qualified.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo showed no sign of the knee problem which led to him being substituted in his last two games for Juventus - prompting an angry reaction on the second occasion - and could easily have reached his 100 on Thursday.</p>
      <p>He was quick was quick off the mark, winning and converting a penalty in the seventh minute.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old got to the ball ahead of Saulius Mikoliunas, who clipped his heel, and converted the spot-kick with a shot into the middle of the goal which hit goalkeeper Ernestas Setkus' foot on the way in.</p>
      <p>Lithuania paid for more sloppiness 15 minutes later as they lost the ball in midfield and Paciencia slipped the ball quickly to Ronaldo who produced a wicked, dipping first-time shot which flew past the bemused Setkus from 25 metres.</p>
      <p>He had another shot on the turn saved by Setkus and blasted over after bursting into the box before the break.</p>
      <p>Pizzi, Paciencia and Silva scored in an 11-minute spell after halftime and Ronaldo sent two efforts agonisingly wide as the siege continued.</p>
      <p>He completed his hat-trick from Silva's pass in the 65th minute before Paciencia set him up nicely for a fourth but Ronaldo fired over the bar.</p>
