      <p>Former President Jerry John Rawlings has lamented the fact that some politicians have mastered the act of deception through lies in order to perpetuate their stay in power.</p>
      <p>He emphasized the need for politicians to speak the truth all the time given that truth is of utmost importance in governance and politics.</p>
      <p>He further urged political leaders to draw lessons from traditional leaders who are guided by traditional customs that forbid them from telling lies as the repercussions of such acts are daunting.</p>
      <p>The former military leader and Founder of the NDC made these remarks while condoling with the Volta Regional National Democratic Congress (NDC), Mr Ametefe, who lost his wife.</p>
      <p>Mr Ametefe was very appreciative of Flt. Lt Rawlings’s visit saying: “What you have done this morning has really touched my heart and the heart of the Region.  This is what defines us as the NDC and you have proven that you still love the NDC and it is my prayer that all the mudslinging and vilification will stop so we can focus on the bigger agenda.”</p>

        <b>Today’s NDC is not the NDC I founded- Rawlings laments</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mr. Rawlings recently  in another round of repudiation against his party suggested that the current National Democratic Congress (NDC) does not represent the principles upon which he founded the social democratic party.</p>
      <p>Speaking at a conference of cadres and activists of the revolution at the Anita Hotel in Kumasi in the Ashanti region on Saturday, Flt Lt Rawlings bemoaned the monetization of the NDC adding that some leading members of the party “have almost purchased the power of the party into their pockets”.</p>
      <p>According to him, the National Democratic Congress 9NDC0was borne out of what he described as fire purely on the principles of democracy but that has changed.</p>
      <p>“And we say its democracy? When money is at play? How can I be the founder of such a party? This thing was borne out of fire”.</p>
