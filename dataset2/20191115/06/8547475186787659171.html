        <b>Nick Hewer and Tony Parsons are among 24 public figures who have said supporting Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister would be to surrender in the fight against anti-Semitism.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a letter to the Guardian newspaper, the group said the path to a more tolerant society "must encompass Britain's Jews with unwavering solidarity" and said Jeremy Corbyn has "a long record of embracing anti-Semites as comrades".</p>
      <p>The letter was penned by many high profile media personalities including the author John le Carré and actress Joanna Lumley.</p>
      <p>They wrote: "The coming election is momentous for every voter, but for British Jews it contains a particular anguish: the prospect of a prime minister steeped in association with anti-Semitism.</p>
      <p>"Under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership, Labour has come under formal investigation by the Equality and Human Rights Commission for institutional racism against Jews.</p>
      <p>"Two Jewish MPs have been bullied out of the party. Mr Corbyn has a long record of embracing anti-Semites as comrades.</p>
      <p>"We listen to our Jewish friends and see how their pain has been relegated as an issue, pushed aside by arguments about Britain's European future.</p>
      <p>"For those who insist that Labour is the only alternative to Boris Johnson's hard Brexit, now, it seems, is not the time for Jewish anxiety.</p>

      <p>"But anti-Semitism is central to a wider debate about the kind of country we want to be.</p>
      <p>"To ignore it because Brexit looms larger is to declare that anti-Jewish prejudice is a price worth paying for a Labour government.</p>
      <p>"Which other community's concerns are disposable in this way? Who would be next?</p>
      <p>"Opposition to racism cannot include surrender in the fight against anti-Semitism. Yet that is what it would mean to back Labour and endorse Mr Corbyn for Downing Street.</p>
      <p>"The path to a more tolerant society must encompass Britain's Jews with unwavering solidarity. We endorse no party.</p>
      <p>"However, we cannot in all conscience urge others to support a political party we ourselves will not. We refuse to vote Labour on December 12."</p>
