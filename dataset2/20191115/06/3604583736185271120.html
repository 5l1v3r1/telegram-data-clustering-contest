      <h1>2020 Road Nats: Mayor Ben Taylor 'very confident' event will remain in Ballarat</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T06:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Hopkins</a></address>
      <p>With the Federation University Road National Championships entering the final year of its three-year agreement with the City of Ballarat, Mayor Ben Taylor has come out as "very confident," the event will stay in the city beyond 2020.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the launch of the event at Fed Uni on Friday morning, Cr Taylor said he is working hard to ensure the national event remains in Ballarat and Buninyong.</p>
      <p>"We've been working with Cycling Australia for a little bit now with the contracts and we do that all the time so it's an ongoing conversation over the contracts and the term," he said.</p>
      <p>"We're working with them now through those details and really what we're aiming for is to continue to have the Road Nationals here in Ballarat and Buninyong for the long term.</p>
      <p>"I'm very confident (it will stay) but again with negotiations we've got to work together... we're just trying to get everyone together, making sure that we're putting the best pitch forward and hopefully we can be confident that we see the (Road Nats) again."</p>
      <p>Cr Taylor added that if the event was to return, it would likely be for another three-year contract.</p>
      <p>The Road Nats have been running continuously in Ballarat since 2007, with the city also playing host to the event from 2002-2004.</p>

      <p>Cr Taylor said one of the biggest reasons he wants to see it remain in the region was for the excitement it brings with it.</p>
      <p>"I have to say, the event is getting better and better every year... It brings more people to town and that's what we want, more activity, more atmosphere and more economic benefit."</p>
      <p>These sentiments were echoed by Fed Uni vice chancellor and president, Professor Helen Bartlett.</p>
      <p>"This partnership is a great fit for us and we would certainly be keen to continue it in the future and keep the Road Nats in Ballarat and coming through the campus," she said.</p>

      <p>"It brings everybody together, from the senior management team to our staff to our students and the local community.... It's more than just a university thing, it's about bringing something to the community."</p>
      <p>Cycling Australia CEO Steve Drake said that the organisation was already in talks with the state government about the future location of the event, however he believes Ballarat remains as the top contender to continue hosting.</p>
      <p>"We would love to have the championships stay here," he said.</p>
      <p>"We've had our championships here for a great many years now and what that has helped to do is build the atmosphere of the event and build the support for it.</p>
      <p>"It makes for a really great five day festival, we're very keen to have it stay here."</p>
