      <p>A 7.4-magnitude <b>earthquake</b> struck 134 kilometers northwest of Malaku, <b>Indonesia</b>, according to the <b>United States Geological Survey</b>, quoted by the Independent.</p>
      <p>The tremor was at a depth of 62km, USGS reported.</p>
      <p>A <b>tsunami</b> warning was issued but it was lifted two hours later.</p>
      <p>The quake struck between the Sulawesi and Halmahera islands.</p>
