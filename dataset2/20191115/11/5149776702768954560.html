      <h2>They seem to be coping pretty well</h2>

      <p>Flooding has affected schools in some parts of the country, with around half a dozen closed today in Derbyshire.</p>
      <p>In Nottinghamshire, however, only one appears to be affected.</p>
      <p>St Peter's C of E Junior <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/education">School</a> in Ruddington is closed due to floodwater affecting access to the site.</p>
      <p>The deputy head teacher confirmed the school's closure today Friday, November 15.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/weather">Flooding</a> is blocking access to the site and there are also problems with blocked drains.</p>
      <p>A trip planned for Year 6 pupils has still gone ahead and staff are working in the school as normal.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for the school said: "There are access issues with floodwater on the pathways and also some drainage issues so the school has been closed.</p>
      <p>"The Year 6 scheduled school trip has still managed to go ahead.</p>
      <p>"All the staff are in as normal. We will wait to see what situation is after the weekend, and will let parents know via text message."</p>
      <p>The heavy rain from Thursday, November 14 also <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/heavy-rain-floods-closed-11-3540938">affected 11 classrooms at the Rushcliffe School</a> in West Bridgford.</p>
      <p>There are also a number of roads still closed across the county affecting motorists and bus services.</p>
