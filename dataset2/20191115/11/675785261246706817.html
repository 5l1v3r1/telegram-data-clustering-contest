      <h1>iPhone 12 leak suggests Apple's next smartphone could have quadruple-lens camera</h1>
      <h2>New renders created by PhoneArena suggest the four lenses will include a wide, ultra-wide, telephoto and time-of-flight lens</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T11:27:09+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 11:27</time> by <a rel="author">Shivali Best, https://www.facebook.com/shivalibestjournalist/</a></address>
      <p>It’s only been two months since <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/apple">Apple </a>unveiled its 2019 <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/iphone">iPhones</a>, but keen fans are already looking ahead to next year’s devices.</p>
      <p>New leaked images claim to show the iPhone 12, and suggest the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/smartphones">smartphone </a>will feature a quadruple-lens rear camera.</p>
      <p>The images, created by <a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/2020-Apple-iPhone-12-could-be-the-most-dramatic-iPhone-redesign-in-years_id120106#media-352622/?tag=exp098-20">PhoneArena</a>, suggest the four lenses will include a wide, ultra-wide, telephoto and time-of-flight lens.</p>
      <p>PhoneArena said: “A Time-of-Flight (or ToF) camera can measure depth much more accurately than a regular one, so it can be a perfect choice for augmented reality uses.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the soft, round shape that Apple has used in its last few iPhones could be set to disappear in favour of flat edges, similar to the iPhone 5, according to the images.</p>

      <p>PhoneArena added: “With the iPhone 12, however, Apple is rumoured to be moving away from the softer contours of present models in favour of a sharper, boxier aesthetic that channels the design sensibilities of the iPhone 4 and 5.”</p>
      <p>And while the dreaded notch could still feature in the iPhone 12, it will be considerably smaller, according to the rumours.</p>
      <p>Finally, PhoneArena gives us a hint of the colours for the iPhone, indicating that it could come in two hues - Rose Gold and Midnight Black.</p>
      <p>The tech site added: “Rose Gold was arguably one of the most popular iPhone colors back in the day, but we haven't seen one since the iPhone 7.</p>
      <p>“The iPhone XS and 11 Pro introduced New Gold, which is supposed to bridge the gap between regular Gold and Rose Gold, but it is neither.</p>
      <p>“We'd like to see a new iPhone that flaunts the rosy shade of some of its predecessors, even if it is in a more understated manner than before.”</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, there’s a bit of wait before we find out if any of the rumours are true - Apple usually launches its flagship smartphones in September!</p>
