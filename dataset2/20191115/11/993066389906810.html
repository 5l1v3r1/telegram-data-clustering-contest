      <p>ICONIC Co Antrim attraction Barry's Amusements is up for sale.</p>
      <p>The Portrush amusement park, famous for its rollercoaster, has been owned by the Trufelli family for almost a century.</p>
      <p>The family released a statement today saying Barry's would be sold as a going concern.</p>
      <p>Advisory firm Grant Thornton has been appointed to find a bidder.</p>
      <p>All 11 full-time staff have been informed and will be kept in employment during the sale, the family said.</p>
      <p>"This is not a decision the family has taken lightly, especially given our 93-year trading history and follows significant and emotional consideration over a prolonged period," the statement read.</p>
      <p>"We understand the special place that Barry's holds in the hearts of many Northern Ireland families, but none closer than our own.</p>
      <p>"We wish to thank all our customers who have helped sustain Barry's down the years and our full-time and seasonal employees who have been pivotal to the success of the business. We hope your memories of Barry's are happy ones.</p>
      <p>"As family operators, we feel we can no longer give the considerable commitment required to effectively manage the business.</p>
      <p>"We hope to pass on the baton to someone who will ensure generations can still enjoy the fun that Barry's offers our local and wider community."</p>
