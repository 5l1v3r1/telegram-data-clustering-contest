      <h1>Heaven knows we’re all miserable now</h1>
      <h2>Forget The Smiths reunion, here’s a top-notch EU band.</h2>

      <p><i>Welcome to Declassified, a weekly column looking at the lighter side of politics. You can find it in </i>POLITICO<i>'s weekly print edition and online on Fridays.</i></p>
      <p>The most hotly anticipated band reunion of, well, ever appears have been scotched after guitarist Johnny Marr dismissed rumours that The Smiths were getting back together.</p>
      <p>Asked by a fan if a rumor that concert promoter Live Nation had won the rights to the band’s reunion was true, Marr replied "Nigel Farage on guitar," a reference to the increasingly right-wing politics of singer Morrissey, who is a backer of the anti-Islam party For Britain.</p>
      <p>So if The Smiths aren't coming back, who's going to play at POLITICO's Christmas party (to be held this year, as every year, in what was once the Manhattan strip club in Maelbeek metro station)?</p>
      <p>How about an impromptu band made up of EU leaders! (What do you mean 'no, that sounds like the worst idea ever?').</p>
      <p>First up a band name. Simply using "EU" is tricky because there was a Washington, DC funk band called Experience Unlimited who were referred to as "EU" and had a hit with, er, "Da Butt." Thankfully there are random band name generating websites. After putting in a few basic details, one such site came up with the following: Emmanuel and the Humans, 27 Seconds to Brussels, Das Peace, and Teenage Rock Blue Togetherness. So, Emmanuel and the Humans it is.</p>
      <p>But who's in the band? This lot:</p>
      <p><b>Vocals: Emmanuel Macron.</b> Charismatic frontman, if a little too fond of his own voice (and face, and ideas ...). Won't let anyone from the Balkans into gigs.</p>
      <p><b>Guitar: Jean-Claude Juncker. </b>The Iggy Pop of the band, Juncker is prone to rock-and-roll excess and repeating himself in interviews.</p>
      <p><b>Bass: Viktor Orbán.</b> Increasingly erratic but long-term band member that everyone's too afraid to throw out.</p>
      <p><b>Drums: Angela Merkel.</b> Nothing flashy but steady on the beat. Will occasionally open the doors at the back of the venue so anyone can get in for free.</p>
      <p><b>Manager: Thierry Breton.</b> Because all of Europe's business interests flow through him.</p>
      <p><b>Security:</b> <b>Boyko Borissov.</b> Because he's terrifying.</p>
      <p>The band would play covers of songs in which the word "You" can easily be replaced with "EU" such as "All EU Need Is Love" and "We Will Rock EU," although probably not Prince's "I Hate EU" or Joan Jett's "I Hate Myself For Loving EU." After years of practice at EU summits, they would play all night (needlessly).</p>
