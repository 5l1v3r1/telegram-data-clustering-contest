      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T11:55:38+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 11:55</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United legends Gary Neville and Ryan Giggs have officially opened the doors to their new hotel, the Stock Exchange Hotel, in Manchester.</p>
      <p>Partnering with hotelier Winston Zahra, they have opened the new hotel in a Grade II-listed building, which features lavish suites with chic, contemporary design and ensuite bathrooms, and a restaurant operated by celebrity chef Tom Kerridge.</p>
      <p>Neville confirmed the news on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> and said: "So six years later Stock Exchange Hotel is restored and the whole building is open today for the first time to the public for some 50 years.</p>
      <p>"A big thank  you to everyone who has worked hard and contributed to make this happen. Take a look if you like."</p>

      <p>The news is sure to get fans excited, with the hotel boasting several stunning perks.</p>
      <p>The crowning glory? 'The House', a 3,500 sq ft apartment with a private entrance, its own gym, a fully fitted kitchen, three bedrooms with ensuite bathrooms, a dining table for 10, a bar and a huge roof terrace with unparalleled views of the Manchester skyline.</p>
      <p>However a stay doesn't come cheap with prices at £1,750 a night - but that also includes seriously luxurious perks including a 24-hour personal concierge, valet parking, in-room dining and even use of the hotel's car, a Lexus RXL.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the hotel, co-owner Giggs previously told the  <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/property/inside-lavish-1750-night-penthouse-17127306">Manchester Evening News</a>  : "I think it will be game changing.</p>

      <p>"We have brought back to life a forgotten Manchester building which was hugely significant of its time.</p>
      <p>"The design respects the heritage of the building and now we’re protecting that history by restoring it.</p>
      <p>"We will be sharing some incredible architectural history with people from all over the world for many years to come, and we hope that it will add another dimension to Manchester.</p>
      <p>"It’s also the type of building that enables the team to offer something really bespoke to guests, a tailored and individual service.</p>

      <p>"There are some fantastic new developments just being finished [elsewhere in Manchester] and in the pipeline but none of them will have their own five star service department attached to them and that’s what differentiates The House from anything else.</p>
      <p>"We have a proven team in place who have been recognised in the industry for their exceptional service credentials.</p>
      <p>"We’re confident that the demand for a property like The House in city centre will be big. Manchester is progressive, it’s moving quickly, so many people are now either moving into the city for the first time or back to the city because of the different business, sport and leisure opportunities there are.</p>
      <p>"The House is a great space for people living on their own, for couples or even families because it’s so versatile."</p>
