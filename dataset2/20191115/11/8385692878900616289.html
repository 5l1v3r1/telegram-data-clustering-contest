      <p>The <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/huawei">Huawei</a> Mate X 5G was <a href="https://www.vmall.com/product/10086831441169.html">made available</a> for purchase in China today, and it sold out really <a href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2019/11/15/huawei-mate-x-5g-sold-out-in-less-than-a-minute-in-first-sale-in-china/">quickly</a>. A rumor suggested that the device will not become available today, but Huawei <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/11/huawei-rumored-to-postpone-the-mate-x-foldable-yet-again.html">denied that yesterday</a>.</p>
      <h3>The Huawei Mate X 5G sold out in less than a minute</h3>
      <p>Well, the company did offer a limited number of devices in China, but the Mate X 5G sold out in less than a minute. This was a flash sale, of course, and it was expected that it will be out of stock soon after it went on sale.</p>
      <p>Huawei confirmed that the next sale of the Mate X 5G is scheduled for November 22. So, those users who did not get a chance to purchase it today, will have another chance next Friday.</p>

      <p>The device was available on Vmall, Huawei's official online store. The variant sold included 8GB of RAM and 512GB of internal storage, and it was priced at CNY16,999 ($2,420).</p>
      <p>On top of that price, Huawei also offered consumers a chance to buy display insurance. Those users who wanted to secure the Mate X 5G display could spend an additional CNY2,699 ($384) in order to do that.</p>
      <h3>The model that was made available ships with the Kirin 980, not Kirin 990</h3>
      <p>Do note that this variant of the Mate X comes with the Kirin 980. This variant of Huawei's foldable smartphone was announced back in February during the Mobile World Congress.</p>

      <p>The company did announce a revised variant of the Mate X in September, during IFA. That model comes with the Kirin 990, not the Kirin 980. For some reason, though, Huawei is now selling the Kirin 980 model.</p>
      <p>The Kirin 990 comes with 5G built-in, it does not need a separate modem like the Kirin 980. 5G needs to be enabled on it, of course. The Kirin 980 variant of the Mate X 5G does include the company's Balong 5000 modem.</p>
      <p>The device is quite expensive, but we knew that was going to be the case. The Mate X is even considerably more expensive than the Galaxy Fold, but that didn't deter Chinese consumers from getting one.</p>

      <p>The Huawei Mate X 5G, unlike the Galaxy Fold, folds outwards. When folded, its display is included on both the front and back, which makes it more prone to damage. Those of you who get this phone will need to be really careful while using it.</p>
      <p>The Mate X 5G does not have a display notch, unlike the Galaxy Fold. The device is made out of metal and glass, and it utilizes the same cameras as its front and rear-facing shooters. This depends on whether your phone is folded or not.</p>
      <p>The Mate X 5G comes with a 4,500mAh battery, 55W SuperCharge fast charging, a 40-megapixel main camera, and so on. We still do not know when will this phone become available outside of China, but we're hoping that will happen soon.</p>
