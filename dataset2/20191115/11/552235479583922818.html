      <h1>‘Smallest’ gallery set to open up in Perth</h1>
      <h2>The Golden Step Gallery has been created on South Street</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T11:52:27+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 11:52</time> by <a rel="author">Melanie Bonn, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/melanie-bonn/</a></address>
      <p>A new art gallery - claiming to be Scotland’s smallest - opens up in Perth city centre next week.</p>
      <p>The Golden Step Gallery has been created within the Inspiration Orchestra’s ‘Shop at 91’ on South Street.</p>
      <p>The shop selling greeting cards and top end used clothing is run as a fundraiser for the Perthshire orchestra, which celebrates the music-making talent of its members who have a variety of disabilities.</p>
      <p>In The Golden Step, there is only enough room to display one artist’s work and so to start the initiative off, the first exhibition is all paintings by Perth’s Stella Kinread.</p>
      <p>Stella has a physical disability and is a wheelchair user. She is a highly esteemed artist both here in Perthshire and beyond.</p>
      <p>Her magical image of St John’s Kirk lit by starlight from 2015 is a popular print to buy at Christmas time.</p>
      <p>“I am infatuated with the land, the sea, the people, and the built environment,” Stella explained. “Living in an area of such outstanding beauty I cannot but observe with awe.</p>
      <p>“With regards to style, sometimes I paint in a literal naturalistic style full of detail and sometimes I paint in a more abstract manner. It depends on the subject matter, the size of canvas and my response to the subject.</p>
      <p>“After selecting a subject or view, I sketch it, I take photographs and I bring these back to the studio and work indoors.</p>
      <p>“I believe imperfections create their own type of beauty. And perhaps it is true of imperfections in people too.</p>
      <p>“I see colour everywhere and include it in my palette, rarely straight ‘from the tube’. Mixing the desired hue and saturation takes up a great deal of my painting time.</p>
      <p>“Why do I paint? It feels like a compulsion, a need: I started at the age of 11 and have never stopped. I studied at school, at art college and Open University.”</p>
      <p>Stella currently has two paintings hanging in Perth Art Gallery in the Perthshire Artists’ Association annual exhibition. The exhibition at the Golden Step Gallery at 91 South Street opens on Monday, November 18 and will display 20 original works by Stella Kinread, all of which will be for sale.</p>
      <p>It will be open Monday-Saturday, 10.15am till 4pm.</p>
