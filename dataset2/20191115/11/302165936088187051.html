      <p>IPOH, Nov 15 — Tahfiz centre operators in Perak will face legal action if they fail to comply with the safety requirements set by the Malaysian Fire and Rescue Department.</p>
      <p>State Islamic Religion and Islamic Education, Rural and Entrepreneur Development Committee chairman Datuk Asmuni Awi said, however, a moratorium would be imposed until June next year before a detailed evaluation was carried out to determine the action to be taken against those who failed to comply with the safety requirements.</p>
      <p>“At the moment, the government has no plan to take legal action against tahfiz centre operators who have failed to comply with the safety requirements in the near future.</p>
      <p>“However, we will continue reminding and advising them on the matter,” he said at the state legislative assembly sitting at the Perak Darul Ridzuan building here today.</p>
      <p>He said this in response to a question from Ng Shy Ching (PH-Teja) on the state government’s efforts to ensure that all tahfiz schools and centres in the state comply with the safety requirements.</p>
      <p>Asmuni (PH-Manjoi) said there were 82 tahfiz schools in Perak of which five were owned by the state government. — Bernama</p>
