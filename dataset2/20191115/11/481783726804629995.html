      <p>Marketing consultancy Oystercatchers has appointed former Marks &amp; Spencer, Mothercare and Save Children marketer Jude Bridge as its new managing partner.</p>
      <p>Bridge replaces Phil Edmonds, whose resignation was announced earlier this week after two years in charge.</p>
      <p>Bridge has been running her own marketing consultancy for the past two years. Prior to that she has had notable stints as marketing director of United Biscuits, global brand and marketing director at Mothercare, director of marketing and communications at Save the Children and at Marks &amp; Spencer, where she led marketing and oversaw the ‘Your M&amp;S’ campaign, which won an IPA Effectiveness Grand Prix in 2006.</p>
      <p>She is also a former chair of the Marketing Group of Great Britain.</p>
      <p>Bridge says: “I am delighted to be joining Oystercatchers. The commercial environment today is so challenging, and marketers need to work harder than ever to stand out and stay relevant.</p>
      <p>“Harnessing big creative ideas with the power of the data and tech tools at their disposal will be key. As a client I always believed that strong agency relationships were a critical factor in accelerating growth. That’s Oystercatchers’ guiding business principle and I am looking forward to working with clients and agencies to help them achieve that.”</p>
      <p>Oystercatchers, which is owned by Marketing Week publisher Centaur Media, has recently led pitches and projects for brands including M&amp;S, McDonald’s, RBS, Beiersdorf, Invesco, Macmillan, Ladbrokes and Starling Bank.</p>
      <p>Richard Robinson will continue as managing director of Oystercatchers, while founder Suki Thompson continues as chair.</p>
