      <h1>NAB faces hefty penalty after admitting money-laundering breach</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T11:44:29+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 11:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/alex-druce/" target="_blank">Alex Druce</a></address>
      <p>National Australia Bank faces the prospect of further remediation and a huge fine after it revealed it might have made multiple breaches of counter-terrorism and anti-money laundering laws.</p>
      <p>The lender said in its annual report on Friday it might have been involved in a breach or alleged breach of laws governing bribery, corruption and financial crime.</p>
      <p>It said it had provided documents and information to the financial intelligence watchdog.</p>
      <p>NAB said it was unsure how deeply the issue had run and how significant any AUSTRAC penalty would be.</p>
      <p>Commonwealth Bank was fined <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/money/finance-news/2018/06/04/cba-agrees-700-million-settlement/">a record $700 million</a> in 2018 for serious breaches of the same laws.</p>
      <p>NAB said it had self-reported “a number” of issues to finance intelligence agency AUSTRAC, and was investigating and remediating several counter-terrorism and anti-money laundering breaches.</p>
      <p>The bank accepted any confirmed wrongdoing would further harm its reputation and bottom line, both of which have already copped a hiding in the wake of <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/money/finance-news/2018/09/06/asic-nab-fees-no-service/">misdeeds uncovered by the financial services royal commission</a>.</p>
      <p>“The potential outcome and total costs associated with the investigation and remediation process remain uncertain,” the bank said in its annual report.</p>
      <p>“Given the large volume of transactions that the group processes, the undetected failure of internal AML/CTF controls, or the ineffective implementation or remediation of compliance issues, could result in a significant number of breaches … and significant monetary penalties.”</p>
      <p>Shares in the bank had dipped by 1.26 per cent to $27.45 by 11.30am (ADST) on Friday.</p>
