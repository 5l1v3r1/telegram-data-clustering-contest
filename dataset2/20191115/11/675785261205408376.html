      <h1>Tyson Fury outlines three-fight plan ahead of Deontay Wilder rematch</h1>
      <h2>Fury is due to take on Wilder on February 22 but the world champion must first beat Luis Ortiz next weekend</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T11:41:26+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 11:41</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Domin, https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfighting</a></address>
      <p>Tyson Fury will target the winner of Anthony Joshua's rematch with Andy Ruiz Jr if <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/deontay-wilder">Deontay Wilder</a> loses to Luis Ortiz.</p>
      <p>Fury has agreed a deal to face heavyweight world champion Wilder in a rematch in February 22.</p>
      <p>But the American must first overcome Ortiz next weekend in a repeat of their thrilling clash last year.</p>
      <p>And should Ortiz upset the odds, Fury will look for an alternative opponent.</p>
      <p>"When one door closes another one opens. So if he loses, he loses. He’ll have a rematch with Ortiz no doubt. And I’ll look for the winner of Andy Ruiz Jr vs Anthony Joshua on the same date," he told talkSPORT.</p>
      <p>If Fury does fight Wilder - and wins - he may have to agree to a trilogy clash before targeting a unification bout.</p>

      <p>"I believe 100 per cent yes. It has got to happen. I have three fights left on my contract," he added. "Deontay Wilder is next and if Wilder wants it again, he can. Then I will fight the winner of Joshua and Ruiz Jr for sure."</p>
      <p>Fury released his autobiography this week to much acclaim and detailed his struggles with depression.</p>
      <p>Fury explained how he had gone to the pub dressed in a skin-tight skeleton costume at the height of his drinking and mental health issues and decided to return home early.</p>
      <p>"At that point I knew I couldn't do it on my own," he said. "I got on my knees and, for the first time in my life, I knew I couldn't stop going to the pub (and stop) eating on my own.</p>
      <p>"I was crying. When I arose, I was bouncing with excitement. I had faith that everything was going to be alright."</p>

      <p>Fury spoke of the importance of his religious beliefs and admitted to a possible psychosis diagnosis by his psychiatrist, who claimed in the book that "without faith, he would have killed himself".</p>
      <p>Fury added: "At one point I believed I was being tortured by demons. When you're really mentally unwell, you do see and hear things."</p>
      <p>Fury also opened up about some of the abuse and mistreatment he has faced as a member of the travelling community.</p>
      <p>He said: "I used to get called disgusting names. I was bullied quite a bit as a kid until I got big and started fighting back.</p>
      <p>"I have been refused entry to pubs and restaurants because I'm a traveller."</p>
