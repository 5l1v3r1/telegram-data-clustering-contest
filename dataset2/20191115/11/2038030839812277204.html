      <p>Cape Town – It's no more Mr Nice Guy for Dwayne' The Rock' Johnson.</p>
      <p>The actor's long-awaited DC Comics standalone superhero movie,<i> Black Adam</i>, finally has a release date.</p>
      <p>The<i> Jumanji</i> actor who was first linked to the project in 2014 will be seen in the titular role in cinemas in 2021.</p>
      <p>The character of Black Adam - who was created by cartoonists Otto Binder and CC Beck in 1945 - is an archaeologist who is transformed into a powerful ancient Egyptian.</p>
      <p>The role will see Dwayne play the part of Shazam's greatest adversary.</p>
      <p>The 47-year-old shared the news on Instagram alongside a first look image of himself as Black Adam.</p>
      <p>In the lengthy caption, he wrote: "Like most kids growing up, I dreamed about being a superhero. Having cool superpowers, fighting for what's right and always protecting the people. It all changed for me, when I was 10yrs old and was first introduced to the greatest superhero of all time - SUPERMAN.</p>
      <p>He continues: "As a kid, Superman was the hero I always wanted to be. But, a few years into my fantasy, I realised that Superman was the hero, I could never be. I was too rebellious. Too rambunctious. Too resistant to convention and authority. Despite my troubles, I was still a good kid with a good heart - I just liked to do things my way."</p>
      <p>About the character he writes: "Black Adam is blessed by magic with the powers equal to Superman, but the difference is he doesn’t toe the mark or walk the line. He’s a rebellious, one of a kind superhero, who’ll always do what’s right for the people - but he does it his way. Truth and justice - the Black Adam way."</p>
      <p>Dwayne went on to say that he is honoured to take on the role that is unlike any other he has had in his career.</p>
