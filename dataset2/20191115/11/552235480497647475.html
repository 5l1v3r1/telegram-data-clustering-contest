      <p>Carlos Queiroz insists <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alfredo-morelos">Alfredo Morelos</a> form for Rangers means it is impossible to leave him out of the Colombia side.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old has netted 22 goals for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> this term and the prolific hitman is desperate to break his international duck at the fifth attempt when they face Peru today.</p>
      <p>And former Real Madrid boss and No.2 at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/sir-alex-ferguson">Sir Alex Ferguson,</a> Queiroz, believes Morelos more than merits his place.</p>
      <p>He said: "It's everyone's responsibility in my team to score goals - not just the strikers.</p>

      <p>"All the attacking players in the squad are confident, especially Alfredo Morelos who has already scored more than 20 goals this season.</p>
      <p>"He is playing really well and I am confident he will show the form he has shown for his club for us.</p>
      <p>"The team will score goals in these games - I am sure of that."</p>
      <p>Morelos is also set to feature for his country next week against Ecuador in a friendly in Harrison, New Jersey.</p>
