      <p>There's nothing worse than having to de-ice your car at 7.30am in the -3C cold.</p>
      <p>Scrapping ice of the windscreen can take forever, with pouring boiling water over the car a massive no.</p>
      <p>But one man might have just made that morning chore a lot more pleasant after he coming up with a new way of doing it - and it's genius.</p>
      <p>He shared his idea on social media and people are loving the idea, and many have already tried it for themselves.</p>
      <p>Instead of using a can of de-icer and a scraper, Daniel Harris fills a sandwich bag with warm water, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/mans-genius-de-icing-hack-13909399?_ga=2.67973842.2132443085.1573804033-1735012691.1561448173">The Mirror</a> reports.</p>

      <p>He then simply drags it over the windows and watches the ice melt immediately.</p>
      <p>He wrote: "Hot water in a food bag and bam you've got a de icer and a hand warmer. Works a treat, and it's fast!"</p>
      <p>He later added: "I used warm tap water so I could safely hold it and lower the risk of cracking my screen.</p>
      <p>"The de-icer cans are so cold in the morning and this way keeps you nice and toasty. Oh and yes it was ice not condensation.</p>
      <p>"I know it looks it but try it and you won't be disappointed."</p>
      <p>The trick could come in handy as temperatures plummet across Devon and Cornwall, with more overnight frosts expected for the next few days at least.</p>
