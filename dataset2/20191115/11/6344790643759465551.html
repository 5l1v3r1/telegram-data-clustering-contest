      <h1>The Russo Bros. Produced Middle East Elite Police Unit Film MOSUL Acquired By 101 Studios</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T11:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author">Tommy Williams</a></address>
      <p><b><i>Mosul</i></b> is the directorial debut of <b>Matthew Michael Carnahan</b> and 101 Studios recently acquired the distribution rights for the U.S. The film has been receiving praise at film festivals around the globe and the premise sounds a little nuts.</p>
      <blockquote>“Mosul” was shot in secret this past spring on location in the Middle East, exploring the true story of an elite police unit made up almost entirely of native sons of Mosul and their desperate fight, block-by-block to reclaim their city. “Mosul” is based on an extraordinary feat of journalism by Luke Mogelson in The New Yorker in which he embedded with the unit for two months.</blockquote>
      <p>Of course, many are excited for the film because two of the producers are <b>Anthony</b> and <b>Joe Russo</b> who have won fans over again and again with <b><i>Community</i></b>, their Marvel films, and just about everything else they do. The Russos issued the following statement:</p>
      <blockquote>Our writer/director Matthew Michael Carnahan was the perfect artist to depict this uniquely regional story which champions a culture that has never really been championed on screen before. The heart of the movie depicts the innate desire to fight for country and home.</blockquote>
      <p>There’s no firm release date, but 101 Studios does currently plan to release <i>Mosul</i> in 2020.</p>
