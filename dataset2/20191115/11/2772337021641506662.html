        <b>Music managers Scooter Braun and Scott Borchetta won't let the Blank Space pop star sing songs from past albums</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.celebsnow.co.uk/tag/taylor-swift"><b>Taylor Swift</b></a> has claimed music managers<b> <a href="https://www.celebsnow.co.uk/tag/scooter-braun">Scooter Braun</a></b> and <b><a href="https://www.celebsnow.co.uk/tag/scott-borchetta">Scott Borchetta</a></b> have banned her from singing any of her old hits, which they own the rights to.</p>
      <p>And, for this reason, her Artist of the Decade performance at the upcoming American Music Awards is in doubt, as well as a Netflix documentary that’s been three years in the making.</p>

      <p>Taylor explained what was going on to her fans in an explosive statement, in which she labelled Scooter and Scott “tyrannical”.</p>
      <p>Along with the screenshot of the statement, Taylor wrote, “Don’t know what else to do.”</p>
      <p>In the statement, Taylor revealed how she’d been planning to perform a medley of her hits throughout the last decade at the AMAs.</p>
      <p>But Scott and Scooter said she wouldn’t be allowed “because they claim that would be re-recording my music before I’m allowed to next year.”</p>

      <p>She explains how the producers also stopped her from using any of her old music in a Netflix documentary she’d been creating.</p>
      <p>She adds, “The message being sent to me is very clear. Basically, be a good little girl and shut up. Or you’ll be punished.</p>
      <p>“This is WRONG. Neither of these men had a hand in the writing of these songs. They did nothing to create the relationship I have with my fans.”</p>
      <p>The battle over Taylor’s music began when she left Big Machine Label Group – whose founder and chief executive, Scott, signed her as a 14-year-old and with whom she had recorded six albums – for Universal Music Group in November 2018.</p>

      <p>The UMG deal gave her ownership of her master recordings at that label – something she did not have at BMLG.</p>
      <p>In June, Scott sold BMLG to Scooter, who manages Justin Bieber and Kanye West, and who Taylor claimed was responsible for years of “incessant, manipulative bullying” of her.</p>
      <p>As a way of reclaiming some control over her music, Taylor said in August that she planned to record copycat versions of her back catalogue from November next year.</p>
      <p>Neither Scott nor Scooter have responded to Taylor’s claims as of yet.</p>
