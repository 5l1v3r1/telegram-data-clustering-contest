      <h1>Huawei MatePad Officially Coming on November 25th - Gizchina.com</h1>

      <p>Huawei’s consumer business CEO, Yu Chengdong, just announced that a new member of the Mate family will be released in Shanghai on November 25th. Some netizens quickly speculated that we will see the new MatePad at the conference – they’re probably correct.</p>
      <p>As we can see in the teaser above published by Yu Chengdong, we can indeed clearly read the word “Mate”. Now, while the other letters are blurred out, we can still somewhat see it says “Pad”. Thus confirming a new tablet is entering Huawei’s Mate family.</p>

      <p>The current Mate series line covers various product categories. Going from mobile phones to foldable devices and laptops such as the MateBook series. So, on November 25th, the Mate moniker will be adopted by the tablet line as well. Most probably a high-end one at that.</p>
      <p>Huawei’s MatePad is very likely going to be the first tablet to feature a <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/06/huawei-matepad-pro-with-40w-fast-charge-gets-3c-certification/">full screen design</a>. With that we mean a screen that covers most of the screen with a punch-hole to integrate the camera sensor. The tablet is also expected to pack a dual rear camera setup; once again getting closer to modern smartphone trends.</p>

      <p>As we previously mentioned, the Huawei MatePad is going to be a high-end tablet. Thus we could find a flagship-grade mobile CPU such as the home-developed Kirin 990 chip; currently the most powerful Huawei chip on the market.</p>
      <p>Finally, the MatePad could be available in a more powerful Pro variant. But at the moment we lack any real info about the latter.</p>
