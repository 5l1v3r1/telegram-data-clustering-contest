        <b>A stag died after becoming entangled in plastic tape on a Scottish island.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It is feared the animal was trapped in the discarded strapping for a week before he was discovered on Jura in the Inner Hebrides.</p>
      <p>Gamekeeper Scott Muir, 32, found him struggling on an island hillside on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>He believes the stag went without food for about a week as his mouth was jammed closed by the debris. The animal had to be put down.</p>
      <p>Mr Muir said the stag was likely to have got his antler caught in the plastic while grazing on seaweed on the coastline.</p>
      <h3>'Tired and stressed'</h3>
      <p>He believed the stag then walked for about a mile on to the hillside before reaching his final resting point.</p>
      <p>Mr Muir said: "I was walking over the estate when I saw the plastic waste and realised there was a stag caught.</p>
      <p>"I thought it was dead at first but as I approached it I could see his head start to move.</p>
      <p>"These can be 18st animals and I know how powerful they can be, but he looked tired and stressed and he couldn't see because the plastic was right around his antlers".</p>

      <p>Mr Muir is a volunteer for Wild Side of Jura, a group which aims to protect the west coast of the island.</p>
      <p>He said the plastic pollution on the island had been getting worse over the last six years and believed commercial fishing was probably responsible.</p>
      <p>The picture was posted on social media and local residents expressed their anger.</p>
      <p>One resident said: "That's shocking, poor animal, the thought of him struggling with that for hours makes me so angry.</p>
      <p>"So much plastic out there, it makes it much more of a reality when you see the damage it does so close to home".</p>
