      <p>Xbox intends come out swinging when the next-generation of consoles kicks off.</p>
      <p><b>Phil Spencer</b>, head of Xbox, remembers the start of this generation of consoles very well. Microsoft, which had dominated the generation before, entered the race with a more expensive price tag, a less powerful box, and a muddled message about DRM and ownership.</p>
      <p>The company has spent the last several years correcting the mistakes of that era, but conceded that the battle for dominance this generation has long been won by Sony. When the next generation rolls around, however, Spencer hopes it will be a different story.</p>
      <p>“I would say a learning from the Xbox One generation is we will not be out of position on power or price,” Spencer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/14/20965239/xbox-project-scarlett-price-performance-ps5-phil-spencer-interview">The Verge</a> at X019.</p>

      <p>“If you remember the beginning of this generation we were a hundred dollars more expensive and yes, we were less powerful. And we started Project Scarlett with this leadership team in place with a goal of having market success.”</p>
      <p>That said, Spencer also wants the next Xbox to stand out with more than just price and power; by offering services and features not available on other platforms.</p>
      <p>“So we’re going all in. We’re all-in on Project Scarlett and I want to compete, and I want to compete in the right ways which is why we’re focused on cross-play and backward compatibility.”</p>
      <p>Xbox Scarlett has not yet had a proper reveal, even if we ultimately <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/06/09/xbox-scarlett-120fps-8k-halo-infinite/">know as much about it</a> as we do <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/10/08/ps5-hardware-accelerated-gpu-ray-tracing-4k-blu-ray-media/">PS5</a>. Next year, lines will be drawn when both platform holders start getting serious.</p>
      <p>We spoke to marketing boss Aaron Greenberg at X019, who reiterated Microsoft’s focus on <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/11/14/speed-higher-frame-rates-powerful-cpu-major-goals-xbox-scarlett/">“higher frame rates” with Scarlett</a>.</p>
