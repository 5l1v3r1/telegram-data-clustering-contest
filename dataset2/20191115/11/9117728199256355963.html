      <h1>Kubica: There are things "we have handled in a good way"</h1>

        <b>It has been far from plain sailing for <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/robert-kubica">Robert Kubica</a> this season as the Polish driver has struggled at the back of the field for most of the season. The <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/williams">Williams</a> driver has been reflecting on his one season return to Formula 1.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kubica made a fairytale return to the pinnacle of motorsport after a devastating rally crash eight years ago. He returned this season at Williams, partnering <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/george-russell">George Russell</a> and it seemed to be a dream return. However, it has fallen flat and Williams and Kubica have struggled all season, managing just one point courtesy of the Pole's P10 in Germany.</p>
      <p>Kubica will leave Williams at the end of the season and he has been reflecting on his season, picking out some highs and lows.</p>
      <p><i>“Coming back to a competition sport, as Formula 1 is, on the highest level of motorsport, after a long time and with my limitations, a lot of people did not even think I would be able to race,”</i> said <a href="https://twitter.com/WilliamsRacing/status/1195073194174091265">Kubica</a>.</p>

        <i>“I heard many stories that in Turn 1 that will not be able to react to situations and probably the opening lap is one of the things which I managed well this season.</i>

        <i>“I heard rumours that I would not be able to race in Monaco, and probably Monaco was one of my best drives during this year, although I was still far behind. But feeling-wise it was positive.</i>

        <i>“The team is working hard but it is not an easy season. There are many things which we could probably handle better. But there are also things which I think that, although the season has been difficult, we have handled in a good way."</i>
