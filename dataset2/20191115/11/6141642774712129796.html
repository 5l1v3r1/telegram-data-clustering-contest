      <p>Last season, both the Champions League and Europa League finals were contested by Premier League teams.</p>
      <p>BT Sport reported a 26 per cent increase in Champions League viewer hours, with the final between Liverpool and Tottenham made available for everyone to watch in the UK via social media.</p>
      <p>A record 11.3 million people tuned in across all platforms to watch the Reds go on and lift the European Cup for a sixth time in Madrid.</p>

      <p>Chief executive of BT’s Consumer Division Marc Allera said: “We’re delighted to remain the home of UEFA Champions League in the UK.</p>
      <p>“BT Sport leads the way when it comes to UEFA Champions League coverage, and we are very excited to continue to bring our world class coverage to one of the most exciting football competitions in the world – whether that is broadcasting 12 games simultaneously or delivering industry leading images in 4K UHD.</p>

      <p>Labour has costed the policy at £20billion, saying it will deliver free full-fibre internet to every home and business by 2030 if it wins the General Election.</p>
      <p>But BT chief executive Philip Jansen said the Labour Party had dramatically under-estimated the price of its pledge, saying it would cost closer to £100b.</p>
      <p>The BT share price later stabilised to just a two per cent fall – nevertheless wiping nearly £500m off the company’s value.</p>
