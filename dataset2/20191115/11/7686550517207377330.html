      <p>A dad was stunned after he bought a 'Twirl' chocolate bar - which had three fingers.</p>
      <p>Samuel May, 72, bought the Orange Twirl for 49p - and was expecting two bars of choc inside.</p>
      <p>He noticed the wrapper was bigger than he thought and he found it had three fingers inside.</p>
      <p>Samuel, of Swindon, Wiltshire said: "I’d been looking for these Orange Twirls for ages. Me and my partner absolutely love chocolate but we couldn’t find them anywhere.</p>

      <p>He said: "They were by the tills when I got there. So I was quite excited to have found them and I picked up a couple for me and my partner.</p>
      <p>He said: "I was looking at them and thought ‘that one is a bit bigger than the other’.</p>
      <p>"I was just holding it and could feel there were in fact three fingers in it. One on top of the other two. It’s mad isn’t it?</p>

      <p>"I feel like I just can’t believe it. I can’t find these bars for ages and then pick first one up and it’s got three fingers in,''</p>
      <p>Samuel says he isn’t sure what he’ll do with the third stick of chocolate but said he may share it with his youngest daughter, Nalah.</p>
      <p>He said: "I’ve got an eight-month-old who likes sucking on chocolate at the moment so I may give it to her to enjoy. It’s just one of those funny things.</p>
      <p>"It would be nice if it was the only one in the world. Hopefully there’s more good luck to come, now is a good time to by a lottery ticket.''</p>

      <p>A spokeswoman for Cadbury said: “The reaction to the launch of Cadbury Twirl Orange has been incredible and the product is in very high demand across the country.</p>
      <p>"This guy has hit the jackpot by finding three fingers in a rare limited-edition Orange Twirl. We can’t promise there will be any more to come.”</p>
