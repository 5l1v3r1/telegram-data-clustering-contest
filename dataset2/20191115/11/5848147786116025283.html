      <h1>Police nightclub shooting victim ‘can’t sleep at night’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T11:31:20+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 11:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/newdaily/" target="_blank">The New Daily</a></address>
      <p>A victim of the Victoria Police shooting at an erotic nightclub party has called the officers who fired on her and her then boyfriend “criminals”.</p>
      <p>Zita Sukys was wounded when she and her then-partner Dale Ewins were <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/state/vic/2019/11/14/dale-ewins-zita-sukys-swingers/">sprayed with bullets</a> while they were engaged in a sex act at the Inflation nightclub in Melbourne in July 2017.</p>
      <p>Police say they were called to reports of a man with a gun, but Mr Ewins was carrying a $2 toy.</p>
      <p>“I still can’t sleep at night,” Ms Sukys told <i>The Age</i> newspaper on Friday.</p>
      <p>“A payout isn’t going to make me feel safe. The shooters are still out there and are criminals in my eyes.”</p>
      <p>A Supreme Court trial accusing the state of Victoria of negligence and excessive force was settled this week. A reported $3 million payout will be divided between Mr Ewins, Ms Sukys and club owner Martha Tsamis.</p>

      <p>Ms Sukys also received an official apology stating that she was an “innocent bystander who was injured through no fault of her own in the circumstances of the case”.</p>
      <p>The case was settled just before Mr Ewins was to give evidence, meaning his version of events will stay secret.</p>
      <p>Ms Tsamis said on Thursday that “maybe cool heads [had] prevailed”.</p>
      <p>“As far as I’m concerned we’ve done nothing wrong and we were prepared to fight it all the way,” she said.</p>
      <p>Victoria Police said on Thursday it would finally investigate the actions of its officers, none of whom have yet been reprimanded.</p>
      <p>“The finding made in regards to this was that they (officers) acted in self-defence,” Deputy Commissioner Shane Patton said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“We will now open up that investigation file again and look at all of the facts, if there is anything additional that may give cause to alter that, or review it.”</p>

      <p>Mr Ewins has emphatically denied pointing the gun at police and CCTV footage of the heavily-armed officers swarming through the nightclub and opening fire is inconclusive.</p>
      <p>Mr Ewins and Ms Sukys were dressed like punk icon Sid Vicious and a naughty schoolgirl at the nightclub’s Saints and Sinners party.</p>
      <p>Mr Ewins was shot twice in the back, tasered three times, beaten and stomped on, while Ms Sukys was shot in the leg.</p>
      <p>Victoria’s Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission slammed police for not investigating its officers.</p>
      <p>“Victoria Police only investigated the conduct of the patrons involved in this incident, and not the actions and conduct of police officers,” IBAC Commissioner Robert Redlich QC said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Mr Patton said police were waiting for the civil lawsuit to finish before doing their own review, but Mr Redlich said that wasn’t an excuse.</p>
      <p>“That was not an appropriate reason for not undertaking the necessary review,” Mr Redlich said.</p>
