      <h2>Headlights held them back from Top Safety Pick+ rating</h2>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/09/17/2020-ford-escape-first-drive/">redesigned 2020 Ford Escape</a> and its platform-mate, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/10/01/2020-lincoln-corsair-first-drive/">the 2020 Lincoln Corsair</a>, have both just completed their bout of <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/tag/crash+test/">crash tests</a> at the hands of the <a href="http://www.iihs.org/">Insurance Institute for Highway Safety</a>, and while they did not emerge unscathed, they did <a href="https://www.iihs.org/news/detail/redesigned-ford-escape-new-lincoln-corsair-are-top-safety-picks">come away with the agency's Top Safety Pick Award</a>.</p>
      <p>One caveat: The rating only applies to the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/ford/escape/">Escape</a> equipped with the available LED headlights, which were deemed Acceptable. Similarly, the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/lincoln/corsair/">Corsair</a> needs the available curve-adaptive LED headlights, also rated Acceptable, in order to achieve Top Safety Pick. The Escape's standard halogen headlights scored only a Marginal rating, while the Corsair's base LED headlights were deemed Poor due to glare. Those low headlight ratings knock the vehicles out of contention for Top Safety Pick. Had either vehicle offered headlights able to achieve a Good rating, that would have been enough to get them the agency's Top Safety Pick+ rating.</p>
      <p>Outside of their headlights, the 2020 Escape and Corsair acquitted themselves well. The Escape saw a big improvement in the difficult small-overlap front crash test, going from a Poor result in the previous generation to Good with the new one. The Corsair performed identically, and both achieved Good ratings in all six crash tests. The <a href="http://www.iihs.org/">IIHS</a> also tests automatic emergency-braking systems, and the standard and optional systems in the Escape and the Corsair both earned Superior ratings.</p>
