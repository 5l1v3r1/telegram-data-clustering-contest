      <h1>Students cautioned on unsanctioned campus youth events</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T11:07:30+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 11:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://journal.com.ph/authors/joel-dela-torre" target="_blank">Joel dela Torre</a></address>
      <h3>INTERIOR and Local Government Secretary Eduardo Ano has reminded students that the series of events at several campuses of the University of the Philippines (UP) for the 1st National Students’ Youth Camp (NSYC) are not endorsed by the National Youth Commission (NYC) which should be the agency to spearhead the activities in observance of National Student’s Day.</h3>
      <p>According to Ano, the youth should think twice and be more discerning before joining such events which left-leaning groups are likely to take advantage of.</p>
      <p>The DILG chief said that the 1st NSYC which will be held on Saturday and Sunday (November 16 and 17) as well as the series of events from November 11- 21 are not organized by the NYC, the agency mandated by law to lead annual activities for students.</p>
      <p>“We just want to make it clear that the 1st National Students’ Youth Camp as well as the other activities organized by the National Union of Students of the Philippines (NUSP) and other allied groups are not government-endorsed. These are separate activities that are not sanctioned by the government and the NYC,” he said.</p>
      <p>Under Republic Act 11369 or the National Students’ Day Act, it is the NYC that is tasked to lead the annual program of activities for the National Students Day with the support of the Department of Education (DepEd) and the Commission on Higher Education (CHED).The NYC is an agency under the DILG.</p>
      <p>Parents are asking if the government is aware the students are being encouraged to attend the youth camp and other National Union of Students of the Philippines (NUSP)-led activities which are being circulated on social media.</p>
      <p>Ano said he received reports that the youth camp along with the other activities are being used by Communist-led front organizations as a venue to agitate, deceive and recruit the youth into the communist movement.</p>
      <p>“While the intent of RA 11369 is to inculcate love of country and social responsibility among the youth, leftist groups are taking advantage and riding on the observance of the National Students’ Day to do the opposite and that is to fuel distrust in the government and duly constituted authorities and advance their communist agenda,” he said.</p>
