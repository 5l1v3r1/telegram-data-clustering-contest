      <p>Accra, Nov. 15, GNA - The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has organised a two-day training workshop on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) for journalists to enable them understand and effectively educate the public on the dangers of misusing antibiotics.</p>
      <p>AMR occurs when microorganisms, including; bacteria, viruses and fungi, evolve and are no longer affected by the drugs that would otherwise kill them.</p>
      <p>It also comes when antimicrobials are used in humans, animals and the environment exacerbates the problem.</p>
      <p>The most common antimicrobials are antibiotics, which treat infections caused by bacteria.</p>
      <p>The workshop organised in collaboration with the Ministry of Health, among others seeks to unravel the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and use (AMU) to media practitioners to facilitate advocacy and reporting for behavioural change.</p>
      <p>Ms Daisy Leoncio, the FAO representative, speaking at the workshop said the training formed part of activities to celebrate the World Antibiotic Awareness Week.</p>
      <p>She said AMR was a serious threat to millions, and may result in countless deaths globally over the next few decades hence, the need to educate the public on its dangers.</p>
      <p>The theme for the global campaign, " Antibiotics: Handle with Care", reflects the overarching message that antibiotics are a precious resource and should be preserved.</p>
      <p>In trying to solve the menace there was the need for antibiotics to be used to treat bacteria infections, only when prescribed by a certified health professional, she stated.</p>
      <p> "Antibiotics should never be shared and its full course of treatment must be completed and not saved for future use," it stated.</p>
      <p>Dr Martha Gyansa-Lutterodt, the Director Technical Coordination at the Ministry of Health and Chairperson of the Ghana AMR Platform, said times when people walked to pharmacy and chemical shops to purchase antibiotics without prescription were over.</p>
      <p>She said the antimicrobials used to treat infectious diseases were limited due to abuse and it would therefore be difficult to treat new replacement soon without stopping the abuse.</p>
      <p>Prof Kwame Ohene Boabeng, the Head of Pharmacy Practice at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST)and Deputy Chairman of the AMR Platform,, in his presentation recounted the need to intensify efforts on AMR issues if not it would be difficult to manage cancers in the coming years.</p>
      <p>He said even though much was done in the prevention and control of infectious diseases, there was still the need to step up the strategies.</p>
      <p>Mr Japheth A. Opintah, Medical Microbiology Department, University of Ghana said antibiotics were a good form of a pillar to complex disease management but was overused and misused.</p>
      <p>He said 700,000 people die of AMR each year around the world hence the need to caution people about wrong usage of antibiotics.</p>
      <p>Mr Opintah called for media stewardship to ensure that antimicrobials were used rationally to reduce microbial resistance.</p>
