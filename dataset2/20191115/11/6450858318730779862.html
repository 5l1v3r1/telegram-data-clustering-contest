      <p>The Sims 4, the latest instalment in the hugely popular life simulation <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/articles/game/">game</a> franchise, was announced by EA in May 2013 but didn't hit the shelves until September 2014, followed by the Mac release in February 2015.</p>
      <p>Since then it's gone on to have a number of added packs to widen the gameplay and offer new ways to explore the game. But when are the next The Sims 4 packs coming out, and what will they be called?</p>
      <p>Here, we bring you the official Sims 4 release dates, news, and also take a closer look at all the other packs that are on sale now.</p>

        <h3>What Sims 4 games are available?</h3>
        <p>EA launched The Sims 4 on PC in 2014, then in February 2015 for Mac as a digital download from the Origin store. If you already downloaded the game for PC but now wish to play it on your Mac, you can do so simply by using the product code on the box. All buyers of the Mac version will get a PC copy and vice versa.</p>
        <p>You can buy The Sims 4 <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3522251-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Ffeature%2Fgame%2Fsims-4-expansion-packs-dlc-3522251%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.origin.com%2Fen-gb%2Fstore%2Fbuy%2Fsims-4%2Fmac-pc-download%2Fbase-game%2Fdigital-deluxe-edition">from Origin here</a>, or <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00KHJLXN2/?ascsubtag=06-3522251-11-0000000">from Amazon here</a>.</p>
        <p>In comparison to its predecessor - The Sims 3 - this game has quite a lot of improvements, including advanced Create a Sim modes which allow players to completely customise the look of a Sim by clicking and dragging directly on the Sim's body. The same mechanics have also been applied to the build mode.</p>
        <p>The new emotions feature also added a whole new layer to the game, making a Sim’s mood impact on the gameplay and bring out new interactions with other characters, objects and events.</p>
        <p>After launching the base game, EA has gone on to release a plethora of content which can be divided into three types:  </p>
        <p><b>Expansion Packs</b> are the biggest of the three, usually offering a new world, a whole heap of gameplay options, items and much more.</p>
        <p><b>Game Packs</b> tend to focus on a smaller area of life that'll bring some new fun things for you to experience with your Sims.</p>
        <p><b>Stuff Packs</b> only offer a minimal add-on to the base game, which mostly include new items, features in Create a Sim and new career paths.</p>
        <p>The latest game in The Sims 4 franchise is an <b>Expansion Pack</b> <b>called The Sims 4 Discover</b> <b>University</b>, which is out now globally<b>.</b></p>

          <h3>The Sims 4 Discover University </h3>
          <p>The Sims 4 Discover University is out now on PC and Mac, and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3522251-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Ffeature%2Fgame%2Fsims-4-expansion-packs-dlc-3522251%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ea.com%2Fen-gb%2Fgames%2Fthe-sims%2Fthe-sims-4%2Fpacks%2Fexpansion-packs%2Fthe-sims-4-discover-university%23buy">you can buy Discover University here</a>. It's not out yet on consoles, but will be coming out on 17 December. You can pre-order it on <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/the-sims-4-discover-university/9n5x5dbfv5qc?rtc=1&amp;activetab=pivot:overviewtab">Xbox One</a> and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3522251-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Ffeature%2Fgame%2Fsims-4-expansion-packs-dlc-3522251%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.playstation.com%2Fen-gb%2Fproduct%2FEP0006-CUSA09216_00-TS4DISCOVERUNIPO%3Femcid%3DEAFranchise2019">PS4</a>. </p>
          <p>The Sims community have been demanding a university-based expansion practically since the beginning of time, so this is possibly the most anticipated expansion of the franchise so far, and it looks like EA have been listening about various requests from players. </p>
          <p>Sims can enrol in one of two colleges - the historical University of Britechester or the modern Foxbury Institute. There, they can take classes to get ahead in future jobs, which also include three new career paths: engineering, education, and law. Sims can choose from a wide variety of electives, including Biology, Computer Science, Art History, and (our personal favourite) Villainy. The more Sims attend lectures and complete assignments, the better they'll fair on the career ladder. </p>
          <p>Of course, it's not just all work and no play. Sims can explore dorm life, extra-curricular activities, pull pranks against the rival school, attend school-spirit events and explore everything that the campus has to offer. It's safe to say we've never been more excited to be a student.</p>

            <h3>The Sims 4 Expansion Packs </h3>
            <p>There are currently seven Expansion Packs available for The Sims series, all offering different forms of gameplay. Here’s what’s already been released:</p>
            <h4>The Sims 4 Get To Work</h4>
            <p>The Sims 4 Get To Work brings three new active careers that offer fully playable career venues, which means you'll get to go to work with your Sim. It also brings businesses to The Sims, so you can have your Sim set up their own bakery, clothing boutique, art gallery, bookstore and more. You'll also get new skills including Photography and Baking, and if that's not enough, you also get Aliens (random!).</p>
            <p>The three playable careers are Doctor, Police Officer, and Scientist. As a Doctor, your Sim will spend their day treating patients, performing surgeries and delivering babies. As a Police Officer, you'll investigate crime scenes, interrogate Sims and arrest criminals. And as a Scientist, you'll get to build inventions, collect unique specimens and decide whether you want to use your creations for good or evil.</p>
            <p>

            <h4>The Sims 4 Get Together </h4>
            <p>Get Together, which was the second full expansion pack to arrive for The Sims 4, introduces lots of new features for the socialites among you.</p>
            <p>The world of Windenburg brings with it a hedge maze to explore, natural pools and some ancient ruins for the more adventurous Sims. Your Sims can also visit cafés, pubs and clubs with new objects and activities including foosball, bonfires and dance parties.</p>
            <p>Skills introduced in this pack include DJ and dancing, and you can throw parties absolutely anywhere. There's also a walk-in closet (which is also a new location to WooHoo if that's what you're into), and an exclusive private island to visit within Windenburg.</p>

            <h4>The Sims 4 City Living</h4>
            <p>EA's third expansion pack brings a new city called San Myshuno to the game, and that city features four different neighbourhoods. There are new career tracks including Politician, Social Media and Critic, the latter two of which have never been seen in The Sims before.</p>
            <p>You can now move your Sims into apartments, you can take them to Karaoke bars, Geek Con, the Spice Festival and lots more.</p>

            <h4> The Sims 4 Cats &amp; Dogs</h4>
            <p>Cats &amp; Dogs brings lots of the elements that we loved in The Sims 3 Pets to the newer version of the game, with a new Create a Pet tool to allow you to personalise your cat or dog's appearance. You can even dress your pet in various cute accessories.</p>
            <p>Pets in The Sims 4 have minds of their own, which means you'll be able to train them and watch their personalities develop. But it’s not just pets that you’ll get - the new veterinarian career lets you run your own clinic, hire staff and look after all of the animals in the neighbourhood.</p>
            <p>Cats &amp; Dogs also introduces the world of Brindleton Bay, a coastal town that's perfect for pets, with beaches and a lighthouse and a harbour. </p>

            <h4>The Sims 4 Seasons</h4>
            <p>The purpose of The Sims 4 Seasons, as the name suggests, is to introduce seasonal changes to the lives of your Sims. That means you can expect to see crisp snowfall in the short days of winter and sweltering heat in the summer, with seasonal changes affecting your world in unique ways.</p>
            <p>Along with the four seasons, you can expect seasonal activities. You can ice skate in the winter, host a summer pool party or, for those rom-com fans out there, share a kiss in a fresh spring downpour. You can celebrate traditional seasonal celebrations, as well as create your own holidays on specific dates. </p>
            <p>Seasons also introduces the Gardening Career, allowing you to follow your flower-inspired dreams to become a Botanist or Florist.</p>
            <p>

            <h4>The Sims 4 Get Famous</h4>
            <p>With the rise of social media and a generation of kids that want to be influencers when they grow up, it makes sense for EA to introduce the ability to become famous in The Sims - and that's exactly what Get Famous delivers. You can rise to fame in your current career, or ditch the old job and take on something a little more interesting. Whether you aspire to be a world-class actor, actress or influencer, Get Famous has you covered.</p>
            <p>As you rise in fame and popularity, you'll attract more attention, perks and starstruck fans that'll want to meet you. You can put in the extra work creating custom costumes, learning lines and more, all with the aim of getting that big break.</p>
            <p>Get Famous introduces the trendy district of Del Sol Valley where your Sims are the talk of the town. Featuring starter homes in Mirage Park to stunning, high-end houses in the hills of The Pinnacles and nightclubs for your celebri-Sim to party in. And as you rise through the ranks of stardom, you'll gain access to luxurious perks including gold-plated furniture or unique statues that reflect various achievements in your career.</p>

            <h4>The Sims 4 Island Living</h4>
            <p>Experience beach and ocean life in Island Living. Bring your Sims to a paradise and explore everything that the beautiful world of Sulani has to offer. From exploring caves and discovering hidden island secrets, to taking to the ocean and meeting mermaids… yep, mermaids!</p>
            <p>Island Living also introduces the new Conservationist career, so you can help save the environment of the surrounding beaches and make a difference in the world. Take your Sims off the grid by moving them into a traditional beach hut without electricity. You can even decorate your home and dress your Sims in traditional native styles, and celebrate island traditions by hosting kava parties.</p>
            <p>Alternatively, take on one of the new part-time jobs - Lifeguard, Diver and Fisherman - so you can spend the rest of your time just chilling out on the sands. Just don’t lie in the sun for too long, because your Sims may get sunburnt!</p>

              <h4>Realm of Magic</h4>
              <p>As the name suggests, Realm of Magic focuses purely on magical elements, making it the first pack to do so since The Sims Makin’ Magic, originally released in 2003. The pack includes a new world called Glimmerbrook. Whilst it may appear like a quiet town on the surface, there’s a portal that lies within the town that can take Sims to whole other dimension.</p>
              <p>Realm of Magic introduces a new life state, spellcasters, who can use spells and curses, create potions and even acquire familiars which include dragons, fairies and even pets if you own the expansion pack Cats &amp; Dogs.</p>
              <p>Dress Sims up in full witch or wizard gear and kit out your lot with all the new mythical items and clothes that are available. Even watch your Sim ride about on a broomstick - which we can all agree is the superior method of transportation.</p>

                  <p>Now that we're in the digital age, this gives EA a chance to add some improvements to The Sims 4, and some fun and exciting tweaks, through DLC packages that are free to the user.</p>
                  <p>One of the biggest free updates include the introduction of freelance careers. Sims can choose from one of three paths - Freelance Programmer, Freelance Artist and Freelance Writer - and pick and choose their own hours and gigs for a more flexible lifestyle.</p>
                  <p>EA also introduced new gender customisation options that aren't restricted by gender boundaries that were previously in place. You can create a Sim with any type of voice, walk, physique, clothing and hairstyles no matter which gender you choose.</p>
                  <p>The game studio also released a brand new world, Newcrest. Newcrest came with 15 empty lots ready for you to fill with whichever houses and buildings you choose. It's cool to have a blank canvas that you can build from scratch.</p>
                  <p>After high demand from many users, Toddlers were also added to the game. This new life stage allowed Sims to build new skills, have new interactions with their parents and (most importantly) gave players a whole bunch of adorable outfits to choose from.</p>
                  <p>Other community requested improvements (it's nice to know that EA is listening) include eye colours and the return of pools and ghosts - which can actually be playable characters.</p>
