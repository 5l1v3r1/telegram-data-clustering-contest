      <h1>Kogi election: Your pleas coming too late, PDP tells El-Rufai, APC</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T11:29:20+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 11:29</time> by <a rel="author">Oluwakemi Abimbola</a></address>
      <p>The Peoples Democratic Party on Friday said the genuflections of Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State and Deputy Governor Philip Shaibu of Edo State to Kogi State electorate on Friday on behalf of Governor Yahaya Bello have come too late.</p>
      <p>In a statement on its verified Twitter handle, the PDP said that the pleas of the El-Rufai and Shaibu are “also a direct confirmation that the failed Governor Bello cannot lay claim to any genuine vote at the November 16 governorship election.”</p>
      <p>PDP said it noted that “The Edo State deputy governor, Philip Shuaibu, also knelt before the Kogi people to beg for Yahaya Bello which further shows that it is public knowledge that the governor misused the opportunity given to him to lead the state.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately, the apology is coming too late in the day and cannot be accepted by the people of Kogi State, whose lives, Yahaya Bello had turned into a living hell in the last four year. Moreover, Yahaya Bello openly confirmed that he is irredeemable as he stood without any sign of remorse while El-Rufai and the Edo State deputy governor begged the unimpressed scanty crowd.</p>
      <p>Governor El-Rufai and the APC ought to have counselled Yahaya Bello at the time he was busy suppressing, insulting, abusing and making life unbearable for the people of Kogi State as if there will not be a day of reckoning.</p>
      <p>The irreversible fact is that the day of reckoning has come. The people of Kogi state have moved beyond Yahaya Bello and APC.</p>
      <p>“PDP advises Governor El-Rufai to assist Governor Bello in preparing his handover notes as he will surely face a crushing defeat at the polls, come Saturday, November 16th.”</p>
      <p>El-Rufai and Shaibu had on Thursday knelt down and begged the people of Kogi State to forgive their governor and elect him for a second term in office.</p>
