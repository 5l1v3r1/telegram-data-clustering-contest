      <h1>Google Assistant’s new Ambient Mode rolls out for some users</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T11:50:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 11:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/mishaalrahman/" target="_blank">Mishaal Rahman</a></address>
      <p>At IFA this year, Google announced a new feature in the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tag/google-assistant/">Google Assistant</a> called Ambient Mode. This mode turns your Android smartphone or tablet into a smart display by showing information from your calendar, the current weather, your notifications, your reminders, music controls, and your smart home controls. You can even show photos from Google Photos, turning your smartphone or tablet into a digital photo frame. To save power, Ambient Mode is only active when your phone is charging or your tablet is docked.</p>

      <p>When Google <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-assistant-ambient-mode-smartphone-tablet-smart-display/">first announced</a> the feature, they only made it available for two tablets, the Lenovo Smart Tab M8 HD and Lenovo Yoga Smart Tab, and two smartphones, the <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/nokia-7-2">Nokia 7.2</a> and <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/nokia-6-2">Nokia 6.2</a>. However, we’ve received tips that indicate the feature is seeing a broader release. At least two users with the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/redmi-k20-pro-xiaomi-mi-9t-pro-review-flagship/">Xiaomi Redmi K20 Pro</a> have reported receiving the new Assistant Ambient Mode, and one user with the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nokia/comments/dw9vjp/is_it_just_me_or_did_anyone_else_get_the/">Nokia 6.1 on Reddit</a> says they have the new mode.</p>

      <p>Our first tipster who sent us these screenshots, XDA Senior Member <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=6070905">abhishek987</a>, told us that he saw a notification from the Google App to set it up, but he didn’t take screenshots of the setup process. When the feature goes live, you’ll be able to toggle it in Settings &gt; Assistant &gt; Say “Hey Google,” at least on Android 10. We’re not sure where the setting will appear on older Android devices since the new “Assistant” subsetting page seems to be exclusive to Android 10.</p>
