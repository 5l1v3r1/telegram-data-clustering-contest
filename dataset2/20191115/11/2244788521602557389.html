      <h1>Bayelsa poll starts tomorrow as INEC retrieves sensitive election materials from CBN</h1>

        <b>INDICATIONS have shown that the controversial Bayelsa Governorship election scheduled for tomorrow, Saturday 16th November would still hold as planned.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Already the officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as early as 8 am visited the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to retrieve sensitive election materials meant for the poll.</p>
      <p>“Our officials are already at the CBN to access the sensitive election materials for tomorrow’s election,” Sarian Dangosu, Publicity Secretary for the commission told <b>The ICIR</b> Friday morning.</p>
      <p>“Election materials are being distributed to the relevant officers.”</p>
      <p><b>The ICIR</b> had observed Thursday how two vans conveyed safety vests into the State INEC office in Yenagoa.</p>
      <p>The safety vests were being sorted by the INEC officials who were supported by security operatives. They are meant for the electorate in the riverine parts of Bayelsa state some of which include Nembe, Brass, Southern Ijaw and parts of Ekeremor.</p>
      <p>Lyon David, the All Progressives Congress (APC) had filed an <a href="https://www.icirnigeria.org/we-are-still-in-bayelsa-guber-race-says-apc-heads-to-appeal-court/">appeal</a> following a Federal High Court judgement which earlier <a href="https://www.icirnigeria.org/apc-has-no-guber-candidate-in-bayelsa-poll-court-rules-two-days-to-election/">nullified</a> David’s candidacy for tomorrow’s poll.</p>
      <p>Wilfred Ifeogha, Director of Voter’s Education and Publicity, the State Independence National Electoral Commission earlier promised on the commission’s resolve to decide on the matter once it acknowledges the court verdict. “For now, we have not heard anything. But once we get the court verdict, the commission will decide,” Wilfred on Thursday <a href="https://www.icirnigeria.org/anxiety-brews-in-bayelsa/">told</a> <b>The ICIR</b>.</p>
      <p>However, President Muhammadu Buhari advised all candidates to believe in the electoral process and be ready to <a href="https://www.icirnigeria.org/bayelsa-kogi-elections-all-candidates-should-be-ready-to-accept-outcomes-buhari/">accept outcome</a> of the governorship election.</p>
