      <p><b>Best</b> Ikea Gaming Chair Windows Central 2019</p>
      <p>A good gaming chair is a fantastic way that you can stay comfortable while playing your favorite titles, and while you'll rarely hear its name in discussions about the best ones, Ikea does offer a handful of quality chairs. Ultimately, between the three that Ikea has made, we think that the <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/markus-office-chair-vissle-dark-gray-90289172/">MARKUS Gaming Chair</a> is the best overall chair since it has an excellent balance of comfort, adjustability, and pricing.</p>
      <h3>Best Overall: MARKUS Gaming Chair</h3>

      <p>When it comes to the best overall chair that Ikea offers, we think that the MARKUS Gaming Chair takes the cake. It features a tall back with an airy mesh, a thickly-cushioned seat, built-in lumbar support, and a comfy headrest. This chair is incredibly relaxing to game in. On top of that, you can adjust the seat height, and you can also tilt the chair back for increased comfort. Also, this chair is less expensive than either of Ikea's other gaming chairs, and you don't lose out on much quality at all, which is a big reason this is our favorite pick. Finally, the chair has a solid weight capacity of 242 pounds, which should be good enough for most users. All of Ikea's chairs have the same weight capacity, so if you need something higher, you'll want to look towards <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/best-mesh-back-gaming-chair">other options</a>.</p>
      <h4>Pros:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Incredibly comfortable</li>
        <li>Fairly adjustable</li>
        <li>Mesh helps keep you cool</li>
        <li>Least expensive of Ikea's chairs</li>

      <h4>Cons:</h4>
      <ul>

      <h3>Elite Pick: JÄRVFJÄLLET Gaming Chair</h3>

      <p>The JÄRVFJÄLLET Gaming Chair should be your choice if you love everything about the MARKUS Gaming Chair, but are also willing to spend some extra money for the addition of an adjustable headrest. This chair is virtually identical to the MARKUS Gaming Chair in every way, but the key difference is that its headrest isn't static and can be tilted to best fit your preferred positioning. The price increase is rather steep for one more feature, but for some, it may be worth the money.</p>
      <h4>Pros:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Incredibly comfortable</li>
        <li>Good amount of adjustability</li>
        <li>Mesh helps keep you cool</li>

      <h4>Cons:</h4>

      <h3>Most Adjustable: HATTEFJÄLL Gaming Chair</h3>

      </p>
      <p>If you'd prefer something that offers excellent adjustability, the HATTEFJÄLL Gaming Chair should be the seat you opt for. It trades the tall mesh back for a lower cushion-based one, which is also very comfortable, but may not be great for tall users. However, the back can be raised a bit, which may help out if you find your height makes sitting in the chair uncomfortable when it's in its default position. Like the other chairs, you can adjust the seat height and tilt back to your preferred angle, but unlike the others, you can also adjust seat and armrest depth with this chair. This makes the HATTEFJÄLL Gaming Chair the most adjustable one out of the bunch. Unfortunately, this also means it's a bit expensive.</p>
      <h4>Pros:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Incredibly comfortable</li>
        <li>Best amount of adjustability</li>
        <li>Great if you don't like mesh</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Cons:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>More expensive</li>
        <li>Tall people may dislike the short back</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Most Adjustable</h4>
