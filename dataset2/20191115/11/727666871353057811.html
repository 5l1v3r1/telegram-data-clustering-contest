      <p><b>(AllHipHop News)</b> R&amp;B vocalist Jhené Aiko has some listeners wondering if she took a subliminal shot at Pop star Ariana Grande on her new single. The speculation stems from the fact that both women once dated Big Sean.</p>
      <p>Aiko's "None Of Your Concern" includes a line where she says, "Of course you on the scene with little miss thing, and trust me she really don't want beef." Less than four months after Sean and Jhené reportedly broke up in late 2018, he was <a href="https://imagez.tmz.com/image/3e/o/2019/02/28/3e83936b0f7e5f0b9eb6933b1e1c3b13_md.jpg">photographed in a car with Grande</a>.</p>
      <p>Before that moment, Grande mentioned Sean on her #1 smash "Thank U, Next" which came out last November. The record is all about the former Nickelodeon actress' past relationships. Ariana and Sean dated for about 8 months from 2014 to 2015.</p>
      <p>Big Sean shows up in the video for "None Of Your Concern" to croon his own verse about a lost lover. The Detroit rapper and Jhené Aiko have collaborated numerous times throughout their respective careers, including 2016's <i>Twenty88</i> joint album.</p>
