      <p>Viewers of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/">EastEnders</a> have turned on Karen Taylor after she told Gray about his wife Chantelle's miscarriage.</p>
      <p>For months viewers have known that <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/eastenders-fans-sickened-as-gray-punches-chantelle/">Gray is abusive towards Chantelle</a> and has <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/eastenders-gray-locks-chantelle-in-the-house-to-beat-her/">hit her on multiple occasions</a>.</p>
      <p>However, ever since finding out <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/eastenders-chantelle-finds-out-shes-pregnant-after-gray-brutally-attacks-her/">Chantelle is pregnant</a> with their third child, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/eastenders-spoilers-gray-tells-chantelle-hes-going-to-therapy/">Gray has promised to be better and has gone to therapy for his anger</a>.</p>

      <p>But sadly a couple of weeks ago, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/eastenders-viewers-heartbroken-as-chantelle-atkins-appears-to-miscarry/">Chantelle found out she had lost her baby after discovering she was bleeding</a>.</p>
      <p>She kept it to herself for a while but eventually told her mum, Karen.</p>

      <p>After some encouragement from Karen, Chantelle knew she had to tell her husband the truth.</p>
      <aside>Karen you idiot!</aside>
      <p>But as she walked home, she ran into Denise who told Chantelle about <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/eastenders-spoilers-albert-square-residents-see-grays-dark-side/">the fight Gray got into at a club a few weeks ago</a>.</p>
      <p>Chantelle confronted the solicitor about what she heard and he told her that he only got into a fight as the other man was starting on people and harassing girls.</p>

      <p>As the pair argued on the street, Karen and Mitch came along with Chantelle and Gray's daughter, Mia.</p>
      <p>Noticing the pair were obviously upset, Karen thought Chantelle had told Gray about the miscarriage and said: "It's not the end of the world, you know?</p>
      <p>"You may have lost this baby but that don't mean you can't try again."</p>
      <p>As Karen walked away, Chantelle looked terrified.</p>
      <p>Viewers have turned on Karen for telling Gray about the miscarriage.</p>

      <p>How Gray reacts remains to be seen, but considering the beatings had stopped since she revealed her pregnancy, could this news put Chantelle back in the firing line?</p>
