      <p>As a welcome consequence of <b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/Storm_The_Court">Storm The Court</a></b>’s victory in the Nov. 1 Breeders’ Cup Juvenile, the Peter Eurton-trained colt will be one of, if not <i>the</i> early favorite for the <b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/p/c/Kentucky_Derby_2020_Contenders">2020 Kentucky Derby</a></b>. That's even though the win under jockey Flavien Prat came at odds of 45-1 after even-money favorite Dennis’ Moment was eliminated by a stumble coming out of the gate.</p>
      <p>Eurton's preparing for the intense media attention and scrutiny with a smile.</p>
      <p>“It feels pretty good,” the trainer recently said. “Not that he’ll be the favorite, but that he came out of the race in good shape and is doing really well.</p>
      <p>“(Storm the Court) is just chilling right now. We’ll be tack-walking him for a little while and then get together with the owners and decide what’s next. I don’t think the Santa Anita stakes book has come out yet, but we’ll look for something in February."</p>
      <p>Santa Anita's Robert B. Lewis Stakes (G3) is tentatively scheduled for Feb. 1, 2020.</p>
      <p>“There’s no hurry," Eurton said. "We’ll let him eat well and sleep well. He’s been filling out so much. Last time we weighed him he was around 1,100 pounds.”</p>
      <p>The media blitz, if all goes well, Eurton is looking forward to experiencing.</p>
      <p>“I don’t mind attention,” he said. “If they’re not talking to you, you’re not doing anything.”</p>
      <p>Prat was aboard for Storm the Court’s three starts prior to the Juvenile. The Kentucky-bred son of Court Vision won his racing debut at Del Mar on Aug. 10, then was sent to the top of the competition ladder in the Del Mar Futurity (G1). Prat was unseated, as was Drayden Van Dyke on Eight Rings, when the latter bolted to the left and bumped Storm the Court in the Futurity. A third, beaten 8 ¼ lengths by Eight Rings, in the American Pharoah Stakes (G1) led to questions about Storm the Court and long odds in the Juvenile.</p>
      <p>“It was a surprise even though we were all expecting him to run a good race,” Prat said recently. “He broke well and put me right into the race, and it turned out our way because the favorite stumbled from the one hole. From that point I was able to control (the pace).</p>
      <p>"Storm the Court showed what he had when he ran here the first time and we were able to get the job done.”</p>
