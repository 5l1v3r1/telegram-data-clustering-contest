      <p>The reaction came after PML-N leaders and Sharif family members rejected government’s decision to allow former PM to go abroad for treatment for four weeks on one-time condition after submitting Rs7 billion as indemnity bond.<br/><br/>PML-N president, while addressing a press conference, said that the game of Prime Minister (PM) Imran Khan and his political team against ex-PM Nawaz Sharif is condemnable.<br/><br/>He said that the incumbent government of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) wants to take ransom from Sharif family in the name of indemnity bond.<br/><br/>Shehbaz further urged that it was high time we stopped doing politics on Nawaz’s health. “I did not think there would be such bitter politics done on someone’s health.” </p>
