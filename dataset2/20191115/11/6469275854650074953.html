        <b>Lottery players can enjoy a free day out at the RSPB’s Leighton Moss nature reserve in Silverdale as part of a country-wide ‘thank you’ in celebration of 25 years of the National Lottery.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Over the past 24 years, grants from the National Lottery Heritage Fund have helped fund several projects including construction of new viewing hides and a spectacular nine-metre high Skytower.</p>
      <p>The RSPB is taking part in the #ThanksToYou campaign, which highlights the contribution National Lottery players make to supporting good causes.</p>
      <p>To celebrate and show appreciation, the nature reserve, located in the Arnside and Silverdale Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, is offering National Lottery players free entry between</p>
      <p>November 23 and December 1.</p>
      <p>One National Lottery ticket or scratchcard entitles the holder, plus up to one additional adult and three accompanying children, free entry to the reserve on any</p>
      <p>of the above dates – which includes the Christmas Market on Sunday, December 1.</p>
      <p>Jon Carter, visitor experience manager at Leighton Moss, said: “We are immensely grateful for the numerous funding opportunities that have allowed us to create a better home for nature</p>
      <p>and people, and we hope that supporters of the National Lottery will come along to see just what is on offer at this fantastic site.”</p>
      <p>Admission to the reserve is usually £8 per adult (free for RSPB members).</p>
