      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Premier Inn managing director Simon Ewins has said the disabled woman's experience is "simply not good enough" after the woman shared the "worst experience I have ever had as a wheelchair user"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T11:32:42+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 11:32</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Rudd, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/andy-rudd/</a></address>
      <p>A woman in a wheelchair claims she was left trapped in a Premier Inn stairwell for one hour during a fire alarm while the rest of the hotel was evacuated.</p>
      <p>The disabled woman, known only as Emily, said it was the "worst experience I have ever had as a wheelchair user".</p>
      <p>She claimed in a tweet at Premier Inn: "Tonight, I was left in a stairwell for an hour while the rest of the hotel was evacuated following the fire alarm. PLEASE RETWEET - this needs to be noticed....@premierinn - you need to do better."</p>
      <p>Emily also claimed that a fire steward asked her why she hadn't used the lift and that another member of staff didn't know where the evacuation chair was.</p>
      <p>To make matters worse, when the chair was eventually found Emily claims staff didn't know how to use it.</p>
      <p>Emily has her own <a href="https://ableemily.com/">blog</a> where she shares her experiences living with a disability.</p>

      <p>Writing about her experiences last night Emily said: "So, 9pm in our hotel, the fire alarm sounds. We go to the refuge point (we're on the fourth floor) and call the bell - nobody comes. After several other hotel guests asked us if we needed help, one of them told a member of staff we were stuck.</p>
      <p>"They told us they didn't know where the evac chair was but "it's probably just someone smoking in their room".</p>
      <p>"Everyone's evacuated, then a fire steward comes past and asks "are you waiting for someone? I don't know where the evac chair is."</p>
      <p>"A lady who is a hotel guest comes by and sees us and is equally horrified and goes to look for help. Eventually after 50 mins a fire steward comes and asks us why we haven't used the lift to get out, we explain that's because you can't use them in a fire.</p>
      <p>"The evac chair arrives after that, and the staff don't know how to unfold or use it. They experiment using it on each other and can't figure it out.</p>
      <p>"All in all I was left waiting in the stairwell for an hour."</p>

      <p>Following Emily's claims on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a>, Premier Inn's Managing Director, Simon Ewins, tweeted her and said: "This simply isn’t good enough and is not reflective at all of our policies, practices or team. We won’t however hide when things have gone wrong. Please DM me so we can address this issue properly and learn from it."</p>
      <p>The hotel's own Twitter account had earlier said: "This is concerning to see and not at all what we would expect. Can you please DM us with your full name, reservation number, hotel location and the email address or post code on the booking? We'll then be able to take a look into this for you."</p>
      <p>Mirror.co.uk have contacted Premier Inn for further comment.</p>
