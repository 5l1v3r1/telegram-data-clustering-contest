      <p>Instagram now removes the likes counter around the world<br/>5 (100%) 1 vote</p>
      <p>For several months, Instagram has decided to test the removal of the counter of likes on its application. After testing the removal of this counter for some accounts in seven countries, the social network decided to expand it globally.</p>
      <p>Last July, Instagram announced the launch of a new test on its platform. The idea was then to remove the display of the likes counter for some accounts. One way to allow users to not be too focused on likes but more on the content posted.</p>
      <p>Initially, this test was available in a total of seven countries: Australia, Japan, Brazil, Canada, New Zealand, Ireland and Italy. Nevertheless, Instagram announced Thursday that it wants to push further its experimentation by extending it to the world. For its part, <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/Facebook">Facebook</a> would seek to offer a similar system for publications on its social network.</p>

      <p>“Starting today, we’re expanding our test of private like counts globally. If you’re in the test, you’ll no longer see the total number of likes and views on photos and videos posted to Feed unless they’re your own”, says <a href="https://twitter.com/instagram/status/1195009164470181888">Instagram</a>.</p>
      <p>Although it is now available to the world, it is still a test. This means that not all accounts will have it now and that the social network, therefore, needs more feedback before considering a potential launch – or rather a deletion – for all its users.</p>
