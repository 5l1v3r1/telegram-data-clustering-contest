      <h2>There are plenty of Black Friday deals out already, well ahead of the big day. Amazon's Kindle Unlimited service is on offer throughout the whole period.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T11:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author">Anyron Copeman</a></address>
      <p>Bibliophiles rejoice; Amazon's Kindle Unlimited service is now offering a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/kindle-dbs/hz/subscribe/ku?ascsubtag=06-3777912-11-0000000">three-month free trial</a> if you sign up before <b>8 December</b>. </p>
      <p>There is usually the option to sample the service for 30 days, but for this limited time period you have the chance to triple your trial time. </p>
      <p>Despite having been announced well in advance of <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/feature/internet/black-friday-2019-3661756/">Black Friday</a>, the promotion will still be valid well beyond the big day. Be sure to carefully time your sign up if you're waiting for a new release!</p>
      <p>Sure, you have to enter payment details, but if you cancel anytime before the 3-month period is up, you won't pay a penny. If you do want to continue your subscription, it's just £7.99 as month thereafter. Considering a single ebook is often more expensive on its own, this remains a great deal. </p>
      <p>Kindle Unlimited is the complete digital book subscription, offering access to over 1 million books, thousands of Audible audiobooks <i>and</i> a selection of magazine subscriptions</p>
      <p>The Kindle app is available across all major platforms, so you can still take advantage even if you don't have an Amazon device. If you have existing ebooks you'd like to be added to your Kindle library, read how to do that <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/how-to/digital-home/how-put-ebooks-on-kindle-3690954/">here</a>.</p>
