      <h2>Every street food outlet, drinking places and all of the 90 stalls</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T11:59:32+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 11:59</time> by <a rel="author">Colleen Smith</a></address>
      <p>Christmas is coming to town and Exeter is lucky to have one of the most beautiful settings for a Christmas market in the country on Cathedral Green.</p>
      <p>The bustling Bavarian village inspired by traditional German markets attracted 600,000 people last year - and this year it will be open for even longer over a full 34 days.</p>
      <p>Entry is free with two warm and welcoming bars to cosy up and soak up the twinkly lights and all the atmosphere whatever the weather.</p>
      <p>For the first time a giant teepee with an indoor roaring log fire has been erected near the Pizza Express in front of the grandeur of the great Cathedral entrance. The Mulled Shack serves hot drinks and mince pies around the fire, with comfortable seats and blankets to cosy-up under.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The big bar is also open all day serving alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks - and families are welcome to bring their food into the warmth and enjoy the sparkling decorations in comfort.</p>
      <p>Shoppers will find every type of great street food as they shop. And shopping is the main reason for the whole thing with an impressive 90 stalls with an impressive choice of unusual gifts from Devon and all around the world.</p>
