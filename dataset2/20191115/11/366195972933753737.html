      <p>You know when you hear that CashMoneyAP tag at the beginning of a song you're in for something dope. Chances are dancing, downloading and adding the song to your playlist could be involved. Well "All I Know" is no exception. The newly released single is easy listening meets hype. CashMoneyAP's production with <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/rich-the-kid/profile">Rich The Kid</a> and Stunna 4 Vegas rhyming over the beat is solid artistry combined. Both rappers flow with confidence over the talented producer's musical creation to give listeners some fire before the weekend.</p>
      <p>The single artwork gives you an idea of the content of the song with a baddie in a mask throwing up money in the air. Getting money is at the root of the song and well, everything if we're being honest. Listen to the new track below.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Getting to the money cause that's all I know (What)<br/>I can't trust these n****s and they sell my soul (My soul)<br/>Racking up these hunnids they don't never fold (Fold)<br/>N****s they be lying, you already told (Woo)</p>
