      <p>Raw Fury's <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/west_of_dead"><b>West of</b></a> <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/west_of_dead">Dead</a></b> got announced last night during Microsoft's X019 event, but guess what – it's coming to Switch too.</p>
      <p>A twin-stick shooter set in a procedurally-generated, monster-filled version of the Wild West, West of Dead showcases the vocal talents of Ron Perlman, who is perhaps most famous for playing the lead character in the two good <b>Hellboy</b> movies.</p>
      <p>Here's some official info:</p>
      <blockquote>A place of gun smoke and darkness, sin and damnation, wendigos and witches. A shifting, chaotic world that takes its form from the memories, culture or beliefs of the souls who pass through. When a dead man awakens with only the memory of a figure in black, he sets into motion a chain of events that have truly mythic consequences.<br/><br/>Step into the boots of the dead man William Mason (voiced by Ron Perlman) and descend into the grim and gritty world of Purgatory in this fast-paced twin-stick shooter that’ll put your skills to test. Dodge behind cover as you try to outgun your enemies in the unknown procedurally generated hunting grounds. The Wild West has never been this dark.</blockquote>
      <p>As you can see from the footage, this is looking pretty special. It's coming next year.</p>
