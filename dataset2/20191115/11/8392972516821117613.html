      <p>Michelle finds out the truth about Robert's double life in tonight's <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/">Coronation Street</a> (November 15 2019).</p>
      <p>Viewers have known for months that Robert Preston has been leading a double life, being engaged to <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/a-short-history-of-coronation-streets-michelle-connor/">Michelle</a> AND pregnant Vicky.</p>
      <p>But it looks like it's all about to fall apart in Friday night's hour-long episode.</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CotkC3scYm0">a preview for tonight's show</a>, Robert goes to see Vicky and it's obvious he's ending their relationship.</p>

      <p>As Vicky has a go at Robert about how she's always put him first, she starts to feel faint.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Michelle and Carla pull up outside and soon see Robert come out of a house, arguing with Vicky.</p>
      <p>At first they're confused as to why Robert and Vicky would be arguing, but when Robert leaves in a taxi, a distraught Vicky turns around and Carla and Michelle can see that she is very obviously pregnant.</p>

      <p>Putting two and two together, Michelle says: "Oh my god!" and starts to tear up.</p>
      <p>Has she finally, FINALLY, realised he's been leading a double life?</p>
      <p>Viewers have seen Robert's web of lies continue to tangle over the last few months.</p>
      <p>After he and Michelle split earlier this year due to them wanting different things, off-screen he began a relationship with Vicky.</p>

      </p>
      <p>But when Michelle wanted them to get back together, he ended his relationship with Vicky.</p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-shock-vicky-pregnant-robert/">Vicky had just found out she was pregnant with his baby</a>.</p>
      <p>When her son Tyler found out, he confronted Robert and revealed that Vicky was pregnant just moments before <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-spoiler-robert-proposes-to-michelle/">Robert proposed to Michelle.</a></p>

      <p>Instead of telling both women the truth, he told Vicky she couldn't come around the Bistro as her being pregnant would upset Michelle, who lost her son Ruairi a few years ago.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Robert told Michelle that he helped with young offenders to explain his absences when he was with Vicky.</p>
      <p>Throughout his double life, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/fed-up-coronation-street-viewers-brand-robert-a-snake-as-he-proposes-to-vicky-with-michelles-ring/">Robert ended up engaged to both women</a>, however he really wants to be with Michelle.</p>
