      <p>ROME -- Italy's government is set to declare a state of emergency in <a href="https://abc7.com/venice-italy-flooded-by-highest-tide-in-50-years/5694021/">flood-ravaged Venice</a>, to swiftly secure the historic city funds to repair damage from the highest tide in 50 years.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte described the flooding as "a blow to the heart of our country."</p>
      <p>He said a cabinet meeting called for Thursday afternoon will declare a state of emergency and approve the first measures aimed at helping the city's recovery.</p>
      <p>Conte spent Wednesday night in Venice, where world-famous monuments, homes and businesses were hit hard by the exceptional flooding. The water reached 1.87 meters above sea level Tuesday, the second-highest level ever recorded in the city.</p>
      <p>Venice's mayor said the damage is estimated at "hundreds of millions of euros."</p>
