      <h1>Day 2 of the public Trump impeachment hearings features ousted U.S. Ambassador Yovanovitch</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T11:41:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 11:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://theweek.com/authors/peter-weber" target="_blank">Peter Weber</a></address>
      <p>Two U.S. diplomats <a href="https://apnews.com/fabcdf12d10f41eaaeddcccf339d08df">will testify Friday</a> in the House impeachment inquiry of President Trump, one publicly and one behind closed doors. House impeachment investigators <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/15/politics/donald-trump-marie-yovanovitch-friday-impeachment/index.html">will depose David Holmes</a>, an aide to acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor, about his assertion he <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/878490/2nd-official-reportedly-overheard-trumps-phone-call-sondland-about-investigations">overheard Trump</a> ask U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland about the status of proposed Ukrainian "investigations" into former Vice President Joe Biden.</p>
      <p>Taylor's predecessor, career diplomat Marie Yovanovitch, will testify in public before the House Intelligence Committee about the shadow campaign, <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/875318/russian-ambassador-nominee-says-believes-rudy-giuliani-part-campaign-against-exukrainian-ambassador">apparently led</a> by Trump lawyer and fixer Rudy Giuliani, that led to her dramatic late-night recall from the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv. Yovanovitch <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/876281/exukraine-ambassador-yovanovitch-says-told-tweet-support-trump-wanted-keep-job">testified in October</a> that Ukrainian officials had warned her to "watch [her] back" and that she <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/876265/former-ukraine-ambassador-told-congress-felt-threatened-by-trump-comments">felt personally targeted</a> by Trump. Months after her ouster, Trump told Ukraine's president that "the woman" Yovanovitch "was bad news" and "going to go through some things," according to the White House partial transcript of that July 25 call.</p>

      <p>On Friday, Yovanovitch will face "Trump's fiercest congressional defenders, nearly all men, about a campaign by other male allies of the president to force her from her post," <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/for-trump-yovanovitchs-testimony-brings-moment-of-reckoning-on-gender/2019/11/14/40aafcba-04a4-11ea-ac12-3325d49eacaa_story.html"><i>The Washington Post</i> notes</a>. "The symbolism of that conflict underscores the significance of the historic probe, which was initiated by the female speaker of the House — Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) — and made possible by female voters who helped deliver the House to Democrats in the last election."</p>
      <p>"Seeing someone like Masha Yovanovitch come forward is going to be an extremely difficult moment for Trump," Nancy McEldowney, a former ambassador to Bulgaria who now teaches at Georgetown University, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/for-trump-yovanovitchs-testimony-brings-moment-of-reckoning-on-gender/2019/11/14/40aafcba-04a4-11ea-ac12-3325d49eacaa_story.html">tells the <i>Post</i></a>. "What I suspect the world will see when she walks into that hearing room is an individual who is not tall physically but really is a towering figure of integrity, inner strength, and unswerving devotion to public service and telling the truth."</p>
