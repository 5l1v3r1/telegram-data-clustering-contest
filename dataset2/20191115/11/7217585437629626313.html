      <p>Uber Eats Pass, a monthly subscription service that entitles customers to unlimited free delivery, is now available in South Africa.</p>
      <p>“Eats Pass is your ticket to unlimited free delivery from any restaurant in your city, at any time,” the company said in an email sent to customers on Friday.</p>
      <p>The subscription tier was first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/21/uber-eats-pass-subscription/">spotted back in May</a> by Jane Manchun Wong for those in the United States.</p>

      <p>For South Africans, Uber Eats Pass will cost R50 a month for unlimited free deliveries on orders above R80. This includes deliveries from any restaurants listed on its service.</p>
      <p>Currently, Uber Eats charges between R10-R15 per delivery depending on the distance between the restaurant and the customer’s location.</p>
      <p>Users can also cancel the subscription at any time, but will automatically renew should it not be cancelled.</p>
      <p>The company’s currently offering a free trial, which will give customers two free months if they sign up before 31 December.</p>
      <p>Users can sign up to Eats Pass through the Uber Eats app.</p>
