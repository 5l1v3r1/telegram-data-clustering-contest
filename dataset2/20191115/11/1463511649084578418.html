      <p>Former Super Eagles’ goalkeeper and captain, Vincent Enyeama, was a surprise guest at the camp of the national football team, Super Eagles, in Uyo on Friday.</p>
      <p>Enyeama, who retired from the national team duties in 2015, was at the Super Eagles’ Ibom GolfHotel and Resorts camp to motivate the players.</p>
      <p>The former Lille of France goalkeeper also took a couple of pictures with the three goalkeepers and the goalkeepers’ trainer, Alloy Agu, in camp.</p>
      <p>Shortly after the visit, Enyeama, who led the Nigerian side to win AFCON 2013 in South Africa, took to Twitter, saying: “What an honour to share this moment with the Super Eagles at the Ibom Golf Hotel and Resorts.</p>
      <p>“I was on my way to playing an 18 hole matchplay game.</p>
      <p>“Wishing them the very best in their next match.</p>
      <p>“The future is bright for Nigerian football.”</p>
      <p>With 101 caps, Enyeama is Nigeria’s joint most capped player of all time.</p>
      <p>He featured in Korea/Japan 2006, South Africa 2010 and Brazil 2014 World Cup.</p>
      <p>He also helped Nigeria to third place finishes in the 2004, 2006 and 2010 at the Africa Cup of Nations tournaments, before captaining the team to victory in the 2013 edition.</p>
