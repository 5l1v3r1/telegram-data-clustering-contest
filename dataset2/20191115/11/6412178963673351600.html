        <b>Manchester United are ready to cash in on a major Old Trafford flop, while AC Milan and Napoli want an Arsenal midfielder – all in Friday’s European press.</b>
      </p>
      <h3>MAN UTD TO LET MAJOR FLOP LEAVE FOR £25M</h3>
      <p>Manchester United have no intention of bringing <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/tag/alexis-sanchez"><b>Alexis Sanchez</b></a> back to the club and want to put a permanent sale in place, according to reports.</p>
      <p>The Chilean forward is spending the 2019-20 campaign on loan at Serie A side Inter Milan after struggling to make his mark at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>And <i>The Athletic</i> states that the 30-year-old will be sold, if he can impress during his time in Italy.</p>
      <p>Sanchez, however, has so far managed to score just once for Inter and is currently on the sidelines with an ankle injury which will keep him out until the new year.</p>
      <p>If Sanchez were to leave Old Trafford next summer, it has previously been reported that United would demand at least £25million for the forward.</p>
      <p>The transfer fee would be used to pay off part of a huge severance package for the attacker, who is still owed in excess of £40m in wages – with almost three years left on his current contract.</p>
