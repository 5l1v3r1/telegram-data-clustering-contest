      <p>Pokemon Sword And Shield have been released today on Nintendo Switch, and the Yuzu emulator can already run the two games.</p>
      <p>While the new entries in the Pokemon series<a href="https://twitter.com/yuzuemu/status/1195079948635164679"> do run</a> on the emulator, they are not in a playable state as of now. Still, it's really impressive how the emulator can manage to run games on day one.</p>

      <p>Pokemon Sword and Shield are the first entries in the series to be released on a home console. The two games feature a new region, Galar, new Pokemon, plenty of new features but also some <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-never-features-full-pokedex-again/">controversial aspects</a>, like the absence of a lot of Pokemon.</p>
      <blockquote>Begin your adventure as a Pokemon Trainer by choosing one of three new partner Pokemon: Grookey, Scorbunny, or Sobble. Then embark on a journey in the new Galar region, where you’ll challenge the troublemakers of Team Yell, while unraveling the mystery behind the Legendary Pokémon Zacian and Zamazenta! Explore the Wild Area, a vast expanse of land where the player can freely control the camera. Team up with three other players locally or online in the new multiplayer co-op Max Raid Battles in which players will face off against gigantic and super-strong Pokémon known as Dynamax Pokemon.</blockquote>
      <p>Pokemon Sword and Shield are now available on Nintendo Switch worldwide.</p>
