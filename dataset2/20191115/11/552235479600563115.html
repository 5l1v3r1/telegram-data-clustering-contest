        <b>1 A CUT ABOVE</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hair care and achieving the optimum results from it rests solely on cutting. Good cuts mean good hair days every day. That’s really what we all want. The cutting process is so vital and we always believe that once complete, a new style should result in the owner being more confident, having more self-respect and even looking younger. When it comes to how the cut looks the stylist needs to take into account head, neck and face shapes. The key to a good cut is how well the client can handle it when they’re not in the salon. Ask your stylist to give you advice on how best to care for it and for some tips on blow-drying it so you can aim for that 'salon look'.</p>

        <b>2 THE RIGHT TONE</b>
      </p>
      <p>Getting colour right can deliver an instant confidence boost and make you look years younger. The art of getting colour right is almost science-like and if done properly the results will be sensational. Traditionally these cooler months sees warmer colours emerging. Creamy blondes replace the icier blondes of spring/summer. When I say creamy it’s a mix of ash blonde and golden. Glossy is the buzzword. We’ll see more 'bronde', blending blonde and brown using warm lo-lights to deliver a great look. Multi-tonal will be the must-have. Chocolate brown with amber flowing into golden tones is a great mix.</p>
      <p>
        <b>3 CONDITION IS KEY</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hair limp looking? Lacking that lustrous appearance you crave? There are solutions out there. Our in-salon intensive conditioning treatments can deliver long-lasting amazing results. These can be tailored to meet your specific needs effectively prescribing you a better looking and feeling head of hair. Benefits can be instant and long-lasting. If frizz is an issue then consider the new Braliz hair smoothing treatment. Can last between three to five months.</p>
      <p>4. <b>BOOST THE LUSH LOOK</b></p>
      <p>Hair extensions can be used to boost your volume and thickness – not just length. They can be a great solution too for thinning hair. We regularly look after clients who seek that lovely lush, thick look and opt for a half head of extensions to achieve that aim. We opt for Great Lengths real hair extensions and the fusion bonding system. There’s no age limit on hair extensions - we see clients in their teens right through to 70s!</p>

        <b>5 RIGHT STYLE</b>
      </p>
      <p>Could you be in a hair rut? As we age our hair tone, skin tone and face shape change. It’s inevitable. Your hair needs to adapt and move with the times too. If you see a photo of your favourite music or movie star sporting a look you’d like to emulate then bring it to the salon – show it on your phone.</p>
