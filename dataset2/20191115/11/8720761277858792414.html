      <p>The ongoing tension in Hong Kong between the government and pro-democracy protesters continues to spill into the tech domain. From a report:<i> Rise, which is among the largest tech conferences in Asia, will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/15/rise-conference-2020-2021/">not run next year as planned due to "the ongoing situation in Hong Kong,"</a> according to Web Summit, the Ireland-based company that organizes the show. The organizer said it is postponing the sixth edition of its annual conference, which is held in Hong Kong, to March 2021 from March 2020. Web Summit, which hosts similar large-scale conferences in other parts of the world, made the announcement today in an email to previous attendees. A spokesperson confirmed the veracity of the email to TechCrunch. "Over recent months, we have been monitoring the ongoing situation in Hong Kong. Our number one concern is the wellbeing, safety, and security of attendees at our events," it said in a statement. "Given the uncertainty of the situation by early 2020 and after consulting with experts and advisories, we have decided to postpone RISE until 2021."</i></p>
