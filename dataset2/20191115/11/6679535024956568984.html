      <p>Despite differences in perception between India and China on the boundary issue, the armies of the two countries have been sensible enough to reduce tensions along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said here on Friday.</p>
      <p>He also said that there has been no tension at LAC near Bum La Pass.</p>
      <p>During a visit to the forward post of Bum La on the India-China border, Mr. Singh congratulated the Indian Army for showing “great maturity” in all situations.</p>
      <p>“I have got the opportunity to interact with jawans here. I am very happy to be informed by my jawans that at this India-China border, which is LAC, we are working very sensibly and Chinese PLA (People’s Liberation Army) is also operating sensibly. There is no tension here at LAC that is near Bum La Pass,” he told reporters.</p>
