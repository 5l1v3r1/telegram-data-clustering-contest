      <p>Plans for <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a>’s redevelopment of their City Ground home continue to gather pace.</p>
      <p>And an exciting new video from the Reds provides supporters with <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-reveal-amazing-new-3540790">a glimpse of what to expect</a> once the project is completed.</p>
      <p>The Peter Taylor Stand is set to be rebuilt to cater for an increased capacity of about 10,000 fans, and will also include new state of the art dressing rooms, a museum, club shop, executive boxes and media suites.</p>
      <p>Improvements will also be made to the other three sides of the ground, with the Bridgford Stand to be extended too.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-city-ground-redevelopment-3541269">The overhaul</a> will see enhanced seating positions, upgraded concourse areas and catering options, improved accessible facilities and new conference and events spaces, with the club also keen to promote greater community usage.</p>
      <p>A planning application is expected to be submitted before the end of the year and work is due to get underway in 2020, with a 15-month completion target.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-city-ground-redevelopment-3507012">Supporters are encouraged</a> to show their support for the project by signing up, <a href="https://www.nottinghamforest.co.uk/news/2019/november/send-us-your-thoughts-on-the-new-city-ground/">here.</a></p>
