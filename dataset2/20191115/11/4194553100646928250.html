      <h1>Tammy Abraham slams England fans for “unacceptable” treatment of Joe Gomez</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T11:27:48+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 11:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/steven-carson/" target="_blank">Ste Carson</a></address>
      <p>Chelsea striker Tammy Abraham has spoken out against the England fans that booed Joe Gomez on Thursday night as the Three Lions humbled Montenegro.</p>
      <p>The young forward bagged himself a goal in the game, but it was marred by the treatment of the Liverpool defender by some England fans.</p>
      <p>You see, the Liverpool defender had the audacity to get attacked by Raheem Sterling in the Three Lions’ camp, and the Man City winger was disciplined by Southgate by way of being dropped from the team.</p>
      <p>In fairness, since the booing of Gomez, Sterling has actually come out on social media to stand up for his team-mate, who he admits has been wronged by himself and then the England fans.</p>

      </p>
      <p>In the aftermath of the England fans’ reaction, there has been a lot of reaction – some have been saying it’s outrageous, others saying it’s an over-reaction and, bizarrely, some even denying it was about Gomez.</p>
      <p>But now Tammy has faced it head on and helped us find out what the reaction of the dressing room was like. “<b>We had the incident today with Joe where we are all England players or fans,</b>” <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/chelsa-star-tammy-abraham-slams-unacceptable-england-fans-booing-liverpools-joe-gomez-11149401/?ito=newsnow-feed">he’s quoted as saying by the Metro</a>.</p>
      <p>“<b>We need everyone to be together, times like that we need the fans to lift us up and help us really when we are going into tournaments.</b></p>
      <p>“<b>We said after the game it was unacceptable we don’t need that really he’s a great player. Things happen in football, things happen between teammates.</b></p>
      <p>“<b>It’s about dusting yourself down and just moving on. We’ve all moved on from the situation and it’s looking positive.</b>”</p>
      <p>Fair play to the young lad for actually saying something about it – it’s also reassuring for us Liverpool fans to know that the dressing room is behind our man.</p>
