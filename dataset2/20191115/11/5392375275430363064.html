      <h1>Apple would market a single subscription for all its services in 2020</h1>

      <p>Apple would market a single subscription for all its services in 2020<br/>5 (100%) 1 vote</p>
      <p>Like Amazon, Apple could offer a “mega subscription” with access to all its services in 2020. Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade and Apple News+ would be offered at a single rate.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-14/apple-mulls-bundling-digital-subscriptions-as-soon-as-2020">Bloomberg</a>, Apple would consider launching a subscription giving access to all of its services. Rather than charging separately for Apple Music, Apple TV +, Apple Arcade, Apple News + and possibly an iCloud storage package, the company would prefer to offer a unique formula giving access to everything it offers. This subscription “Apple+” or “Apple Prime” would be launched in 2020.</p>
      <h3>Apple is playing like Amazon</h3>
      <p>By multiplying the services, <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/Apple">Apple</a> complicates its situation. It must convince users to be interested in each of its proposals and, above all, to pay at different deadlines. A subscriber to all services of the company today can, therefore, be billed at five different dates which is not necessarily practical.</p>

      <p>By playing the card of the single subscription, Apple would facilitate the life of its users while obtaining new subscribers more easily. A subscriber coming for Music and TV+ could be tempted by Arcade discovering that the service is included in his subscription. This is the method that made the success of Amazon that offers through its subscription “Prime” access to many services.</p>
      <h3>Apple’s contract with the press unveiled</h3>
      <p>In his article, Bloomberg explains that the contract that Apple has signed with the media registered to its News + service mentions the existence of a unique formula. Press publishers have agreed to share the money with Apple at 50/50. And expect a drop in revenue if a single bundle is launched.</p>
      <p>A user should indeed save money by subscribing to mega-pack Apple rather than subscribing to each service separately. Apple News+ should, therefore, yield less money. We also learn that the contract that links the media to Apple is valid for one year. And that newspapers could disappear from News +. If their publishers are not satisfied with the service in March 2020.</p>
