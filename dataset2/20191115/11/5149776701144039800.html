      <p>A Hucknall dad has spoken of his anger after his garden was completely flooded for the second time in two years.</p>
      <p>Heavy rainfall battered Nottinghamshire on Thursday, November 14, where a yellow weather warning was in place for 13 hours.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/weather">Floods</a> wreaked havoc across the county during the day and dad of two David Bull was left furious that his garden in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/hucknall">Johnson Avenue</a> was covered with water.</p>
      <p>The 41-year-old said his two sons were left upset by the garden flooding, where they go and play football.</p>
      <p>"It's happened to me twice now. It's major <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/weather">flooding</a>," he told Nottinghamshire Live.</p>
      <p>"The council dug a big hole in Tichfield Park for extra water to run off into. But it hasn't helped my garden at all. Nowhere else floods that I know of around here.</p>

      <p>"It is worrying to see. My two lads have been left really upset and it keeps happening. Every time it rains I worry.</p>
      <p>"My garden is just a floodplain.</p>
      <p>"It just came in so fast. I just feel a bit forgotten about by the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/politics">council</a>."</p>
      <p>Councillor for Hucknall North, John Wilmott, of the Ashfield Independents, told Nottinghamshire Live Ashfield District Council was preparing for a specialist to go out and help Mr Bull.</p>

      <p>He added: "Flooding is never a good thing, wherever it happens, and I can assure Mr Bull we will be helping him where we can.</p>
      <p>"My thoughts go out to any families affected by flooding."</p>
      <p>An Ashfield District Council spokesman said: "Our Environment Team is aware of this isolated issue involving a property adjoining Titchfield Park in Hucknall.</p>
      <p>"We are in contact with the affected resident and we are working with specialists to better understand why this single property is affected by excess water."</p>
