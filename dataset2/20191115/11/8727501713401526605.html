      <h1>A miniature-windmill-free crazy-golf course is opening in Battersea Power Station</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T11:25:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 11:25</time> by <a rel="author">By Angela Hui</a></address>
      <p>I said what, what (in the putt)... Thought crazy golf was <i>extremely</i> 2015? Well, someone clearly disagrees, because new venues are appearing all over London. And, in <i>extremely</i> 2015 fashion, the latest, soon to arrive at Battersea Power Station, comes with an ‘immersive’ twist. Created by the team behind Rooftop Film Club and SFG Club, Birdies new nine-hole mini-golf course is full of twists and turns. Instead of miniature windmills and artificial grass, visitors will be put through their paces in a series of dark passages, pressure pads and towering ramps. Each individual hole has been designed to put your speed, accuracy and determination to the test. Take the ‘Infinity &amp; Beyond’ hole, which is a tunnel that seems to keep going and going and going to...? Who knows where. </p>
      <p>At the moment, the elaborate site at Battersea Power Station is still under construction, so the novelty date will have to wait until it opens on Thursday November 28. Fore! </p>
