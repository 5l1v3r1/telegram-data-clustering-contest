      <p>Pigeons perching on Tiverton Town Hall will be stopped thanks to spikes.</p>
      <p>At a meeting on Monday, November 11, the town council agreed to spend £2,155 on metal spikes which will stop birds roosting on the Grade II listed building which was built-in 1864.</p>
      <p>Town clerk John Vanderwolfe said: “We have as you know problems with pigeons and various other birds that come onto the roof of the Town Hall and leave their deposits, feathers, seeds and everything else.</p>
      <p>“Some time ago, when the Town Hall was under the ownership of Mid Devon District Council and there used to be netting. The problem with that was that on occasions birds got stuck in the netting, and I had the RSPCA inspector here because people could see dead birds which weren’t very nice.”</p>
      <p>Mr Vandewolfe explained that experts had visited the building to help solve the issue.</p>
      <p>“We have had some experts come. They suggest we have spikes so when the sun is shining, they reflect, and therefore birds don’t like to hang about too much.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately, we’re dealing with a tall building, and we have to have a cherry picker and various things that go with that. Because of that, the cost is £2,155.”</p>

      <p>Mr Vanderwolfe explained the problem with birds had gotten worse in the past decades.</p>
      <p>“You’ve always had pigeons,” he said, “but not seagulls – which is the wrong word, I believe it is herring gulls.</p>
      <p>“I can remember years ago when we lived in Bodmin, which is 14 miles from the sea. My mother used to say, ‘it must be rough at sea today because the seagulls are in Bodmin’.  You didn’t see them so much, but you had dustbins with a lid on and such.”</p>
      <p>Councillor Wally Burke also bemoaned a lady who feeds the birds.</p>
      <p>“We have got a lot of pigeons here in Fore Street,” he said. “We have got somebody who will continually feed them.” </p>
      <p>Mr Vanderwolfe added: “We did suggest whether Mid Devon could do her for litter. It leaves an awful lot of mess, and she will insist on it. Not only that, but it encourages rats.”</p>
