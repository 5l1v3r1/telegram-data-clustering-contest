      <h1>Foreign Nationals Resist Police Removal From UN Refugee Agency In Pretoria, Cape Town</h1>

      <p>Scuffles have again broken out between refugees and police at the UN Refugee Agency in Pretoria and at a Cape Town church.</p>
      <p>The Human Rights Commission’s Chris Nissen has told EWN, there has been a scuffle inside a church where hundreds of refugees have been living in Cape Town.</p>
      <p>The foreigners took refuge at the Methodist chapel off Greenmarket Square a few weeks ago after police removed them from outside the UN Refugee Agency’s offices nearby.</p>
      <p>They had camped there for weeks, demanding the UN helps them relocate to their home countries due to xenophobia in South Africa.</p>
      <p>Amateur video footage showed the reverend addressing the crowd inside the church.</p>
      <p>His microphone was then taken and he was forced off the stage.</p>
      <p>A scuffle then ensued.</p>
      <p>It’s understood the refugees had been told to leave the church.</p>
      <p>The situation remains tense and volatile.</p>
      <p>In Pretoria, police were also forcefully removing refugees camping outside the UN Refugee Agency.</p>
      <p>Men and women with babies on their backs were refusing to go, but police officers were pulling them away from the premises.</p>
