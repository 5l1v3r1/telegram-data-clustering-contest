      <p>CAPE CORAL, Fla. -- We're working to find out more about a vehicle versus a building in Cape Coral Friday morning.</p>
      <p>It happened on Cape Coral Parkway near Vincennes Street.</p>
      <p>That's where a vehicle crashed into the front of a financial services business that faces the street.</p>
      <p>There is no word yet on whether there were any injuries, but a sign posted at the site indicates that two front offices are closed due to damages to the building.</p>
