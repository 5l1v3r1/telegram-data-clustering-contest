      <p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://iharare.com/watch-sad-scenes-as-people-cross-make-shift-bridge-in-chimanimani-following-cyclone-idai-destruction/">Chimanimani was hard hit by Cyclone Idai</a> sadly resulting in hundreds losing their lives and a huge number displaced from their homes. The victims have been living in make-shift shelters ever since.</p>
      <p>It never rains but pours (literally) for these people as mother nature seems to be coming back for them, barely a year after Cyclone Idai left them homeless and impoverished.</p>

The break-in is reported to have been done in a flash, just under a minute and 28 seconds. The suspects, who were driving a silver Toyota Runx, pounced at the shop at exactly 12.55 am and threatened the two security guards who were manning the premises with death. Consequently, the guards fled the scene. The robbers gained entry after they smashed the entrance door with an iron bar. While inside, the marauding thieves ransacked the shop and took a total of 16 cellphones that were on exhibition.<a href="https://iharare.com/robbers-caught-red-handed-on-camera/">Read More Here</a></p>
