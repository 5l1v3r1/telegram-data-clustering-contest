      <h1>School bus rear-ended at View Royal intersection</h1>

      <p>A school bus was rear-ended at a busy View Royal intersection during rush-hour traffic this morning.</p>
      <p>There were no students on the bus when it was hit from behind in the intersection of Six Mile Road and Island Highway, said West Shore RCMP.</p>
      <p>West Shore Const. Nancy Saggar said there were no reports of injuries.</p>
      <p>The bus, operated by Garden City Transportation, was on its way to its first pickup of the morning. Greater Victoria School District superintendent Shelley Green said it was able to carry on with its scheduled run.</p>
      <p>The compact car involved in the crash was towed from the scene. The car was headed south at the intersection, toward Colwood, said View Royal Fire Chief Paul Hurst.</p>
      <p>“When we got there, there was just one car in the middle of the road with the police and the bus was gone,” Hurst said. A fire crew arrived about 7:30 a.m.</p>
      <p>“The ambulance didn’t attend and there were no injuries — just backed-up traffic,” he said.</p>
      <p>The car’s oil pan was ripped from under the vehicle, spewing oil on the road, and the engine was smashed.</p>
      <p>View Royal firefighters were sent to clean up the mess, which was on municipal land and not under the jurisdiction of highway maintenance, Hurst said.</p>
      <p>Traffic was snarled despite the quick actions of the fire department, which cleared the intersection in about 30 minutes.</p>
