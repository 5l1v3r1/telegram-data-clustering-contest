      <h1>Kids' brutally honest reviews of 2019's Top 12 Christmas toys - from Nerf guns to Lego</h1>
      <h2>Barbie, Blume Dolls, Frozen dolls, L.O.L, Lego and PAW Patrol all feature in the Dream Toys 2019 top toys for Christmas - but what do the kids think?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T09:38:26+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 09:38</time> by <a rel="author">Zoe Forsey, https://www.facebook.com/zoeforseymirror/</a></address>
      <p>December is creeping closer and closer which means it's almost time to sit the kids down to write their Christmas lists.</p>
      <p>And while this brings the benefit of every parent's favourite "well, Father Christmas won't come if you're naughty" threat, it also means it's time to start thinking about what to get them.</p>
      <p>Dream Toys has put together its annual list of the top toys for Christmas 2019, including breakthrough pieces and a number of old classics.</p>
      <p>Blume Dolls, L.O.L, Nerf guns, PAW Patrol and LEGO have all made this year's list.</p>
      <p>Juliet Ward, head of toys at Argos was part of the committee that put together the list. She told Mirror Online: "It's a really lovely mix of tech and traditional. Some of the tech stuff is really educational but it's great to have the imagination in some of the traditional things as well.</p>
      <p>"I think there is a really good selection, I think there is real range in terms of price - there is something for everyone."</p>

      <p> </p>
