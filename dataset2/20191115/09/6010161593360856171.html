      <h1>October NPD: Call of Duty: Modern Warfare reigns</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T09:15:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 09:15</time> by <a rel="author">Sherif Saed</a></address>
      <p>October has been a very good month for video game revenue this year.</p>
      <p>The monthly <b>NPD Group</b> games report is here, and October has predictably been very busy. Hardware, software and accessories combined to generate $1.03 billion in spending, which is behind October 2018’s $1.57 billion.</p>
      <p>Although that’s a significant drop year-on-year, October 2019 holds the second-highest total for an October this decade. Industry analyst Mat Piscatella believes this to be the result of fewer big games this October, and a two-week late release for Call of Duty compared to last year.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Hardware</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hardware continued to decline in October, dropping 41% compared to last year. Only $182 million were spent on hardware during the month. Nintendo Switch held its dominance, and even saw growth in October.</p>
      <p>Once again, Switch was the best-selling console in October, and the best-selling so far this year.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Software</b>
      </p>
      <p>October this year saw spending of $620 million in software spending, a 37% drop compared to last year. That revenue is significantly higher still than most other Octobers, ranking third behind October 2008 and October 2018.</p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare was October’s best-selling game – now 12 years in a row. Not only that, Modern Warfare also exceeded all other 2019 releases to become this year’s best-seller so far this year.</p>
      <p>The Outer Worlds claimed the second spot, which is good for a new IP. Luigi’s Mansion 3 landed at number three overall, but topped the Nintendo Switch charts.</p>
