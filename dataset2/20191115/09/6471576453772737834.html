      <p>We are of course talking about the oddly named <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/ford-mach-e-mustang-inspired-electric-suv-allegedly-leaked-138542.html">2021 Ford Mustang Mach E</a>, which is Ford's first all-electric sports crossover and was leaked by the Ford website itself a few hours ago.</p>
      <p>The aptly named and rather new <a href="https://www.macheforum.com/site/threads/discovered-2021-mustang-mach-e-official-page-w-pricing-models-specs-video-etc.49/">Mach E Forum</a> was the first to speculate <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/ford/">Ford</a>'s heedlessness and forum member buzznwood managed to screenshot a bunch of parts of the website that shouldn't have been visible to customers.</p>
      <p>So it happens that everyone knows the Mustang Mach E pricing, the number of versions and the specs in almost all their entirety.</p>
      <p>To be available in both RWD and <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/auto-glossary/a.html#ge-all-wheel-drive"><u>AWD</u></a> versions and in different trim and performance levels, the new electric crossover seems to be starting at $43,895 MSRP but can go as low as $36,395 with the maximum $7,500 Federal Electric Drive Motor Vehicle Tax Credit.</p>
      <p>For that amount of moolah, you will be able to get the 2021 Ford Mustang Mach E Select, which comes with rear-wheel-drive (AWD available), an EPA-estimated range of 230 miles and a mid-5-second 0-60 mph acceleration.</p>
      <p>The Mustang Mach E Premium, which will also feature more creature comforts, will start at $50,600 MSRP without the federal tax incentives and offers an EPA-estimated range of 300 miles and a similar mid-5-second 0-60 mph acceleration time.</p>
      <p>Despite featuring an extended range battery and available only as an RWD model, the Mustang Mach E California Route 1 also has a targeted EPA-estimated range of 300 miles and will start at $52,400 MSRP not including the tax incentives.</p>
      <p>The only version available exclusively with the most powerful powertrain, all-wheel-drive and 20-inch wheels is the Ford Mustang Mach E GT, which starts at $60,500 MSRP without the federal tax incentives. The model has the lowest EPA-estimated range at 235 miles but can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in around 3.5 seconds, giving the Tesla Model Y Performance a run for its money. üèÅ</p>
