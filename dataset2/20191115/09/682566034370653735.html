      <p>Mexico City - Heavy rain and thunderstorms forced PGA Tour officials to scrap play in the first round of the <b>Mayakoba Golf Classic</b> in Mexico on Thursday.</p>
      <p>After several delays to a scheduled early morning start, tournament officials abandoned attempts to get the first round under way at El Camaleon Golf Club in Playa del Carmen, south of Cancun.</p>
      <p>Tour officials said heavy downpours drenching the course had left many areas of the layout unplayable.</p>
      <p>"The bottom line is we just don't have a golf course that's playable," PGA Tour rules official Slugger White said.</p>
      <p>"We've got situations out there where we could lose balls in areas that we have no virtual certainty where it was."</p>
      <p>With more poor weather forecast for Friday, White warned of the possibility of a Monday finish for the tournament.</p>
      <p>"Tomorrow, unfortunately, is going to look almost about the same until we get here and see what happens," he said.</p>
      <p>"Monday's always in the mix. Obviously, we hope to finish on Sunday, but Monday will always be there."</p>
      <p>The washout is the first time since 2013 that the opening round of a PGA Tour event has been suspended without any play being possible.</p>
