      <p>Amid growing health concerns over e-cigarettes, Apple will <a href="https://www.axios.com/exclusive-apple-to-remove-vaping-apps-from-store-8669fd94-e92a-4ce4-a9e2-ce5afa598b67.html">remove all 181 vaping-related apps from its mobile App Store this morning</a>, Axios reports. From a report:<i> The move comes after at least 42 people have died from <a href="https://science.slashdot.org/story/19/10/02/2332201/lung-damage-from-vaping-resembles-chemical-burns-report-says">vaping-related lung illness</a>, per the CDC. Most of those people had been using cartridges containing THC, though some exclusively used nicotine cartridges. The company has never allowed the sale of vape cartridges directly from apps. But there were apps that let people control the temperature and lighting of their vape pens, and others provided vaping-related news, social networks and games.</i></p>
