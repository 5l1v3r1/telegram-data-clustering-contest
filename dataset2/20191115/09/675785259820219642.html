      <p>A Greater Anglia passenger was fined after she stood "in the doorway" of the First Class carriage on a packed <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/trains">train.</a></p>
      <p>The woman said she was standing there because "there was nowhere else to stand" - but Greater Anglia said first class carriages, including the vestibules and aisles, are for the use of first class ticket holders only.</p>
      <p>In a video, the woman can be heard saying the incident was ridiculous as she hadn't even sat down on the busy train.</p>
      <p>The commuter,thought to have been travelling home from work to Colchester, was stopped by a ticket inspector at Shenfield around 6.45pm on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Prasad Iyer, 25, from Chelmsford was on his way home and saw it unfold.</p>

      <p>He told <a href="https://www.essexlive.news/news/essex-news/woman-fined-greater-anglia-train-3536818">Essex Live</a>: "It was a really crowded train and it was already full. I was standing right by the door in the last carriage and I saw the ticket inspector get on because he walked past me.</p>
      <p>"There were lots of people standing, but the lady was in the doorway of First Class section and he made a beeline for the her.</p>
      <p>"The first thing I heard was 'where were you standing?'</p>

      <p>"The conversation had been going on for a bit and he said 'you don't have a First Class ticket.'</p>
      <p>"She was trying to explain herself and he kept on asking 'where were you standing?'</p>
      <p>"She was standing there because there was nowhere else to stand. She had moved to the left because people were trying to get on the train."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>In a video filmed by Prasad, the woman can be heard saying: "I'm not saying I have a First Class ticket but there was nowhere to stand, but I stood, I did not sit.</p>
      <p>"There was nowhere else to stand, the train was packed. This is ridiculous."</p>
      <p>Prasad claims he then saw the inspector take the woman's ticket off of her to scan and called over a second man to give the woman the fine.</p>
      <p>He claims he and a few other commuters then stepped in to ask the ticket inspectors how they could take her ticket off of her.</p>
      <p>Other commuters took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> after the incident to complain about what had happened.</p>

      <p>He added: "It was ridiculous.</p>
      <p>"The lady said that she pays around £6,000 per year to get between Stratford and Colchester and rarely ever gets a place to sit.</p>
      <p>"As someone who gets the train to London from Chelmsford for work, I think that it's overpriced and overcrowded.</p>
      <p>"But this scene really kind of combined everything that's terrible in one incident."</p>
      <p>A Greater Anglia spokesperson said: “First class carriages, including the vestibules and aisles, are for the use of first class ticket holders only.</p>
      <p>“If the customer would like to appeal the penalty fare, they can do so via IRCAS.</p>
      <p>“Passengers must have the correct ticket for the time and class of their journey when travelling on one of our trains.</p>
      <p>“We would encourage the woman to contact us direct if she is unhappy with how the situation was handled.”</p>

      <p>Furious commuters blasted rail chiefs.</p>
      <p>Ben Cooper tweeted: "Someone is trying to charge a woman for having STOOD in the doorway of first class on packed train and I’m about to blow my f***ing top.</p>
      <p>Katie Burnell added: "The ticket inspectors on the 18:35 LST- Clacton on Sea are behaving like bullies.</p>
      <p>"A woman is being charged a fine that is completely shocking - she stood one foot in 1st class in a packed carriage.</p>
      <p>"I wish the inspectors used common sense. Truly shocking behaviour."</p>
      <p>A third commuter, Georgie Smith, commented: "Absolutely disgusting behaviour from a ticket inspector on @greateranglia service who is issuing a woman a fine for daring to stand with ONE FOOT in first class despite the train being so busy no one could move.</p>
      <p>"She pays £6,000 for a season ticket.</p>
      <p>"Glad she had the support of many people who didn’t just stand by though."</p>
      <p>Speaking of the conductors, she said: "They actually get commission and have targets to hit, so “just following orders” doesn’t seem valid to me."</p>
      <p>Another commuter added: "I think Greater Anglia should be ashamed of themselves, these trains get so packed you have no option. DISGRACEFUL."</p>
