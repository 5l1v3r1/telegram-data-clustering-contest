      <p>Federal Liberals Andrew Hastie and James Paterson have been barred for visiting China due to their criticism of the country's authoritarian regime.</p>
      <p>The duo were to visit Beijing in December with Labor MP Matt Keogh as part of a study tour organised by China policy think tank China Matters but the trip will not go ahead as planned.</p>
      <p>"We regret the decision of the government of the People's Republic of China, conveyed to China Matters via the PRC Embassy in Canberra, that at this time Mr Hastie and Senator Paterson are not welcome," China Matters said in a statement on Friday.</p>
      <p>In a joint written statement, Mr Hastie and Senator Paterson said they had "looked forward to learning from the Chinese people about their culture, history and perspective during this visit".</p>
      <p>"We are disappointed that this opportunity for dialogue now won't occur," they said.</p>
      <p>"We are particularly disappointed that the apparent reason why we are not welcome in China at this time is our frankness about the Chinese Communist Party."</p>
      <p>Mr Hastie was criticised in August for likening the global response to China's rise to the lack of preparedness in Europe for the growth of Nazi Germany.</p>
      <p>The Western Australian backbencher, who chairs federal parliament's intelligence and security committee, drew a mixed reaction from his coalition colleagues and condemnation from Beijing at the time.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Senator Paterson has spoken out about foreign influence risks at Australian universities.</p>
