      <h1>The advice Manchester United hero Roy Keane has given to Ian Wright before I’m A Celebrity 2019</h1>
      <h2>Some of Ian Wright's former Arsenal team-mates and opponents have been speaking about him being involved in I'm A Celebrity</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T09:40:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 09:40</time> by <a rel="author">Elliott Jackson, Robert Warlow</a></address>
      <p>Roy Keane has urged Arsenal legend Ian Wright not to cry while he takes part in ITV show 'I'm a Celebrity, get me out of here!'</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.football.london/arsenal-fc/">Arsenal</a> and Crystal Palace striker has been confirmed as one of the celebrities going into the jungle for the reality TV show, which is set to start on Sunday.</p>
      <p>It means the 56-year-old will not be seen on TV as a pundit in the coming weeks, but instead taking on a very different challenge alongside other confirmed contestants such as former England rugby player James Haskell, Girls Aloud singer Nadine Coyle and American television star Caitlyn Jenner.</p>
      <p>And a couple of Wright's former team-mates have had their say on his involvement, and his chances of winning.</p>
      <p>Former Arsenal defender Lee Dixon said: "He's either going to win it or he will be out after an hour because it's Wrighty.</p>

      <p>"He loves his food, his sleep and he doesn't like to be buried. There's every chance of that all going wrong, it'll be good watching.</p>
      <p>"He loves his food, he loves his Nancy's cooking. He can cook himself but there will be nothing to eat!"</p>
      <p>Former England international Ashley Cole, who came through the ranks at Arsenal when Wright was in the first team, added: "He was a bit of the joker and as a young kid if we used to see him he'd kick you up the bum, meg you, 'go get me a cup of tea', 'get my boots' so we'd try to hide from him as much as possible."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, former Manchester United midfielder Roy Keane has given Wright some advice ahead of his stint in the jungle.</p>
      <p>He said: "I'm looking forward to watching it but I've asked him 'please don't cry whilst you're in there'."</p>
