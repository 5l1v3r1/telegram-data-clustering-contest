      <p>We've shown you <a href="https://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/climate-weather/videos/all-earth-ice-melt-sea-level-rise-animation">what Earth would look</a> like if all the ice on the planet melted. Many of our favorite cities would simply disappear.</p>
      <p>But a new video by NASA and a study by the <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019GL083722">American Geophysical Union</a> (AGU) add a dose of reality to the story. Their work details just how much Arctic ice has already vanished in the last 25 years.</p>
      <p>The results might have coastal residents looking at more inland property soon.</p>
      <p>Data shows the oldest and thickest Arctic ice is disappearing twice as fast as the rest of the ice in the Arctic Ocean.</p>
      <p>Not only is it melting at an alarming rate, but it's becoming more mobile as the temperature in the Arctic gets warmer.</p>
      <p>Now, the older and thicker ice is more prone to move with ocean currents and atmospheric winds that move through the area.</p>
      <p>In the video above, the younger sea ice is shown in a dark shade of blue, while the ice that's four years old or older is shown as white.</p>
      <p>You can see that as the seasons change, from 1984 to now, more and more of the older ice is either melting or moving out as the warmer months occur.</p>
      <p>The study behind the visual says that in this region there has roughly been 1.3 feet of ice thickness lost per decade and a total of 5 feet since the late 1970s.</p>
      <p>"Eventually the Last Ice Area will be the region that will repopulate the Arctic with wildlife," <a href="https://news.agu.org/press-release/last-arctic-ice-refuge-is-disappearing/">said Kent Moore</a>, an atmospheric physicist at the University of Toronto in Canada and lead author of the new study. "If we lose all the ice, we lose those species. This area will be a refuge where species can survive and hopefully expand their regions once the ice starts returning."</p>
