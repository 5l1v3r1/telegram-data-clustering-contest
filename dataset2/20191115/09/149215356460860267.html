    <meta property="og:description" content="An average of 13.1 million people tuned in to the six major networks during Wednesday's live coverage of the first public hearings in the House impeachment inquiry, according to preliminary numbers Nielsen released Thursday. If you add PBS, Telemundo, CNN, and HLN to the numbers for Fox News, MSNBC, CNN, NBC, ABC, and CBS, the average viewership rises to 13.8 million from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Wednesday. To put those numbers in perspective, nearly 13 million people watched former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's testimony in July, while about 20 million people tuned in for former FBI Director James Comey's post-firing hearing in 2017 and 2018's confirmation hearing for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Wednesday night's CMA Awards drew 11.1 million viewers to ABC. Fox News, somewhat ironically, drew the highest viewership numbers, with an average of 2.89 million people tuning in, followed by MSNBC's 2.7 million.

      <h1>The 1st Trump impeachment hearing had a little ratings pizzazz after all</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T09:20:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 09:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://theweek.com/authors/peter-weber" target="_blank">Peter Weber</a></address>
      <p>An <a href="https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/tv-ratings-fox-news-abc-impeachment-1203405207/">average of 13.1 million people</a> tuned in to the six major networks during Wednesday's live coverage of the first public hearings in the House impeachment inquiry, according to preliminary numbers Nielsen released Thursday. If you add PBS, Telemundo, CNN, and HLN to the numbers for Fox News, MSNBC, CNN, NBC, ABC, and CBS, the average viewership <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/impeachment-hearings-tv-ratings-donald-trump-fox-news-cnn-msnbc-1202786141/">rises to 13.8 million</a> from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>To put those numbers <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/855010/mueller-testimony-drew-fewer-viewers-than-comey-kavanaugh-cohen-hearings">in perspective</a>, nearly 13 million people watched former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's testimony in July, while about 20 million people tuned in for former FBI Director James Comey's post-firing hearing in 2017 and 2018's confirmation hearing for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Wednesday night's CMA Awards <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/trump-impeachment-hearing-tv-ratings.html">drew 11.1 million viewers</a> to ABC.</p>
      <p>Fox News, <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/878652/late-night-hosts-razz-fox-news-gop-saying-trumps-impeachment-should-have-pizzazz-sex-appeal">somewhat ironically</a>, drew the highest viewership numbers, with an average of 2.89 million people tuning in, followed by MSNBC's 2.7 million. Next came ABC (2 million viewers), CBS (1.97 million), CNN (1.9 million), and NBC (1.7 million). ABC won the coveted 25-54 demographic, with an average of 496,000 viewers, followed by Fox News and NBC. The numbers don't include C-SPAN or most streaming viewers.</p>
      <p>These numbers fall "far short of blockbuster level," <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/trump-impeachment-hearing-tv-ratings.html"><i>Vulture</i> notes</a>, but given the obscurity of the two witnesses — U.S. Ambassador William Taylor and State Department official George Kent — and today's "era of audience fragmentation and streaming services," Wednesday's hearings actually "drew a big audience by 2019 standards."</p>
