      <h1>‘Sign of things to come’ Many LFC fans swarm Twitter after seeing Sancho &amp; Trent linkup for England</h1>

      <p>Trent Alexander-Arnold is going to get 100 caps for England, we reckon.</p>
      <p>How Kieran Trippier started ahead of him in the last set of internationals is truly baffling.</p>
      <p>Liverpool’s right-back, still only 21-years-old, is the best on the planet in his position already – so perhaps it’s no real surprise that the also ludicrously talented Jadon Sancho combined so well with him last night as Gareth Southgate’s side pummelled Montenegro 7-0.</p>
      <p>Borussia Dortmund’s prodigy started on England’s right-wing in the absence of suspended Raheem Sterling and did very well.</p>
      <p>He’s been linked with a potential 2020 transfer on countless occasions – most notably by the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7682459/Jadon-Sancho-hands-major-boost-suitors-English-winger-wants-LEAVE-Borussia-Dortmund.html">Mail</a> yesterday – who did claim Manchester United and Real Madrid are also in the running.</p>
      <p>But plenty of Reds on Twitter were convinced Sancho could fit in at Liverpool easily, especially with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain also playing on that side of the field and scoring a goal…</p>

        <b>Here’s a collection of tweets delighting in the combination play between Trent and Jadon:</b>
