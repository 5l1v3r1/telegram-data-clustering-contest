      <p>The leadership of Tunisia’s Ennahda Movement has held an extraordinary meeting on the eve of the constitutional deadline to nominate its candidate for the premiership.<br/><br/>Several figures are vying to receive the support of as many political parties as possible.<br/><br/>Constitutional deadlines  compel  Ennahda to name its candidate on Friday, being the party that has won the largest number of votes in the recent parliamentary elections.<br/><br/>The candidate’s name shall be submitted to President Kais Saied to officially task him to form a government and discuss names of the candidates for ministerial portfolios.<br/><br/>During the Movement’s Shura Council meeting on Thursday, members reviewed a group of resumes for candidates, both inside and outside the government.<br/><br/>The council discussed the files of former regime's Health Minister Mondher Znaidi, current Prime Minister Youssef Chahed, Energy and Mines Minister Mongi Marzouk, and current Development, Investment and International Cooperation Minister Fadhel Abdelkefi.<br/><br/>However, Ridha Ben Mosbah seems to be the most probable candidate for the premiership.<br/><br/>Ben Mosbah, who is an independent figure, has served as Tunisia's ambassador to Belgium and was head of the diplomatic mission to Luxembourg and the European Union.<br/><br/>He has previously held several positions, including the CEO of the Tunisian Company of Electricity and Gas (STEG), CEO of the Gafsa Phosphate Company, CEO of the Tunisian Chemical Group and Secretary of State for the industry in charge of renewable energies and the agro-food industry. <br/><br/>Heart of Tunisia Party (Qalb Tunes), which is returning strongly to the political scene after being initially “rejected” by Ennahda, supports the candidacy of Fadhel Abdelkefi.<br/><br/>Ennahda won the parliament leadership and its candidate, Rached Ghannouchi, received 123 votes in return for 45 votes to his main rival Ghazi al-Shawashi from the Democratic Movement.<br/><br/>Since then, the movement has focused on consultations and negotiations on forming the next government and on naming the candidate who would become the country's premier.<br/><br/>Ghannouchi’s candidacy received the support of Ennahda's representatives in the new parliament (52 votes), the Dignity Coalition (21 votes), the Heart of Tunisia (38 votes) and some votes from Tahya Tounes Party and the parliamentary National Reform Bloc, to get 123 votes and be elected parliament speaker, succeeding Mohamed Ennaceur of Nidaa Tounes.</p>
