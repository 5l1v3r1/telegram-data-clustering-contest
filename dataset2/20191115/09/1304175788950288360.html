      <p>NEW YORK – <b>The Harbor Club</b>, located on Rodney Bay in <b>Saint Lucia</b>, has made significant updates to rebrand as the island’s top lifestyle destination under the direction of the newly appointed General Manager, <b>Lester Scott.</b> Beginning Nov. 1, the hotel will roll out all-new concepts in three of its dining spaces, a daily entertainment lineup and new signature excursions only available at The Harbor Club.</p>
      <p>“<i>When I was first approached by this new project, I saw the immense opportunity that The Harbor Club held,</i>” said <b>Lester</b>. “<i>This is a relatively new hotel in a great location right on the harbor, which is really going to allow us to own the water. Travelers looking for adventure, entertainment and incredible food at an affordable price-point will really enjoy what we have to offer</i>.”</p>
      <p><b>DINING</b><br/>The Harbor Club is now home to the newly opened 14North, a luxe restaurant on the top floor of the hotel with stunning views looking over Rodney Bay and Pigeon Island. In this new restaurant concept, Chef Fritz has created a Caribbean-Asian fusion menu with delectable dishes including Conch Ceviche, Asian Chili Lobster, Korean Spiced Lamb Chops and Miso Chili Sea Bass. Additionally, 14North is the ideal location for anyone looking to host an event with a stunning backdrop, such as parties, press conferences, meetings and more.</p>
      <p>The Sushi Bar, which has been moved adjacent to 14North from its harbor deck location, will offer signature rolls with a modern flare. The restaurant features an indoor and outdoor dining space with access to the Sky Lounge, the hotel’s chic roof deck overlooking the island’s mountainscape.</p>
      <p>Julia’s, the hotel’s main dining area which features breakfast, lunch and dinner, has become a Caribbean-style farm-to-table eatery where every ingredient will be locally sourced from Saint Lucia’s farms. Menu items will include Conch Fritters with sriracha mayonnaise; Spicy Julia’s Fried Chicken and coleslaw; Grilled Mahi Mahi with green papaya slaw; Curried Shrimp with sweet potato, pineapple and coconut; Grilled Caribbean Lobster topped with a rum and jerk sauce; Braised Oxtail and more. For a sweet finale, guests will enjoy Banana and Rum Fritters or Cassava Cake topped with rum raisin ice cream.</p>
      <p><b>ENTERTAINMENT</b><br/>Weekly entertainment options have been added, with an assortment of offerings to cater to every type of traveler. Whether guests want to enjoy live music on the pool deck, savor a Sunday brunch or dance the night away at the Sky Lounge, The Harbor Club has something for everyone.</p>
      <p><b>OWNING THE WATER</b><br/>The Harbor Club’s first step in owning the water is the launch of its signature Harbor Club Sunset Cruise, which offers guests a three-hour open bar and passed hors d’oeuvres as it sails down the island to some of the most incredible sunset views Saint Lucia has to offer. As the first of its kind for The Harbor Club, both hotel and offsite guests set sail for a luxurious evening they’ll never forget. This experience is offered Thursday to Saturday from 4 to 7 p.m. and is available for hotel guests for $80 per person or for outside guests for $95 per person.</p>
      <p>Those looking to enjoy the beach can catch the resort’s water taxi to shuttle guests to and from the nearby beach on Pigeon Island.</p>
      <p>The Harbor Club, which was built in 2017 and renovated in 2018 when entrepreneur Wes Hall purchased it, is part of the Curio Collection by Hilton and offers 115 rooms and suites.<br/> </p>
