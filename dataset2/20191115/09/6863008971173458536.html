      <p>Oil prices rose on Friday as OPEC's outlook for oil demand next year fueled hopes that the producer group and its associates will keep a lid on supply when they meet to discuss policy on output next month.</p>
      <p>Optimism that the United States and China could soon sign an agreement to end their trade war also seeped into the market after White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said a deal was "getting close," citing what he called very constructive discussions with Beijing, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil/oil-gains-as-hopes-build-for-opec-supply-curbs-new-optimism-on-u-s-china-trade-deal-idUSKBN1XP06K">Reuters said</a>.</p>
      <p>Brent crude futures were up 28 cents, or 0.5%, at $62.56 a barrel by 0441 GMT, having dropped 9 cents on Thursday.</p>
      <p>West Texas Intermediate crude was up 28 cents, or 0.5%, at $57.05 a barrel, after falling 0.6% in the previous session.</p>
      <p>The rosy mood came after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) said on Thursday it expected demand for its oil to fall in 2020.</p>
      <p>Many analysts said that supports the view among markets that there's a clear case for the group and other producers like Russia – collectively known as 'OPEC+' – to maintain limits on production that were introduced to cope with a supply glut.</p>
