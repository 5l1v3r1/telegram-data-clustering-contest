      <h1>What the Nets are looking for from Iman Shumpert</h1>

      <p>DENVER — The Nets needed an energetic wing defender even before <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/14/nets-caris-levert-out-indefinitely-after-undergoing-thumb-surgery/">Caris LeVert got hurt</a>. Once LeVert damaged ligaments in his right thumb, they couldn’t afford not to add one.</p>
      <p>Enter Iman Shumpert, who was signed Wednesday, suited up Thursday against the Nuggets — but didn’t get into the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/second-half-swoon-extends-nets-misery/">Nets’ 101-93 loss</a>.</p>
      <p>“He fits a need right now. Perimeter defense, that’s always been his calling card,” said coach Kenny Atkinson, who was an assistant with the Knicks during Shumpert’s four-year run at the Garden. “I … know him well, know the personality. He gets after it defensively. That will be his role for us.</p>
      <p>“[Garrett Temple] is a heck of a defender, and we can add another guy like Shump who can really get stops on the perimeter. And he’s versatile. He can play multiple positions. … It shores us up a little on the perimeter.”</p>
      <p>Shumpert spent his first four NBA seasons with the Knicks, then headed to Cleveland, where he not only won a championship ring, but also played alongside new Nets teammates Kyrie Irving and Joe Harris. That kind of familiarity can only help Shumpert as he tries to settle in.</p>
      <p>“Oh, hell yeah. It’s a comfort for me, but it’s also a mutual respect and understanding,” Shumpert said. “I don’t have to reintroduce myself to those guys. I can be myself, do what I normally do and be free out there, especially with KA being the head coach.</p>
      <p>“He was my guard coach. When I first got drafted, I worked out with him 30, 45 minutes before practice every day. Being back under his wing, it just feels full circle being back in New York.”</p>
      <p>Atkinson expressed hesitancy about throwing Shumpert right into the fire, predictable since he hasn’t played this season.</p>
      <p>Shumpert started 40 games for the Kings last season, averaging 8.9 points and 36.6 percent shooting from 3-point range before being dealt to Houston. He didn’t make much of an impact with the Rockets, but he’s perfectly suited for what the Nets need — wing defense off the bench.</p>
      <p>“We sat down and talked. Life comes full circle sometimes,” Atkinson said. “He was just a young developing player when I was with him. I enjoyed working with him. I love his personality, and I love his aggressiveness. He’s an aggressive person by nature. “That fits a little bit of a need for us, that perimeter, aggressiveness. He forces turnovers, which is something we’re not great at.… I’m looking forward to working with him.”</p>
      <p>LeVert got hurt Sunday, and Shumpert learned of the Nets’ interest the next day. They first spoke Tuesday and he signed Wednesday.</p>
      <p>“No matter where I go, I bring an energy and a passion,” Shumpert said. “[They have] a great group of guys, talented guys. Not that I don’t fit in, but I bring something totally different, where it’s not in anybody’s way, it’s not anything but a jell to bring things together.</p>
      <p>“It’s an energy, making broken plays happen, create more opportunities for other guys, creating extra possessions and just being able to play ball, man.”</p>
