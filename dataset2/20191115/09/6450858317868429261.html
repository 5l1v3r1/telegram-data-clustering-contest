      </p>
      <p>The Tommee Tippee Perfect Prep machine is a must-have for any new mum and dad. Rather than boil the kettle, mix the boiling water with the formula, and then wait for the milk to cool before giving it to your screaming baby (or babies) to drink, you can use the Perfect Prep to prepare the formula quickly and know that the milk will be the prefect temperature.</p>
      <p>The Perfect Prep machine is particularly useful when you are thumbling around in the early hours trying to prepare a night-time feed.</p>
      <p>Amazon has money off right now, so it's a great time to purchase one.</p>

      <p>Here's a discount on a Motorola baby monitor. With the MBP36S you can watch your baby (or babies) sleeping on the 3.5in screen, you can pan, tilt and zoom the camera. You can also play one of the five melodies via the monitor.</p>
      <p>The unit also monitors room temperature - any parent knows it's hard to keep the temperature in the nursery cool enough in summer!</p>
      <p>It has a range of up to 300 meters and you will hear an alert if you are out of range. You will also get a warning if the battery needs to be recharged.</p>
      <p>You can purchase additional cameras if required for more than one bedroom.</p>
      <h3>8. Braun ThermoScan 3 Thermometer</h3>

      </p>
      <p>No matter how you protect your baby from germs at some point you will have to face a cold, or worse. Find out how high their temperature is with this handy little gadget. We find it much easier to use than the flimsy film thermometer you have to hold on their forehead (because kids never stay still long enough for them to work!) This takes a second!</p>
      <h3>9. Fisher-Price Rainforest Spacesaver Jumperoo</h3>

      </p>
      <p>There's a smaller version of the popular Rainforest Jumperoo. The Rainforest Spacesaver Jumperoo folds up, which is handy if your living room is full of baby stuff. Baby gets to jump and enjoy flashing lights, music and even play on the piano.</p>

      </p>
      <p>We think this little night light is cute, all you need to do is touch the top to make it come on - tapping more to make it brighter. It's a soft light which is less disruptive to sleep, we find. And since it's rechargeable you won't find yourself looking for new batteries in the middle of the night.</p>
      <h3>11. The Gro Company Gro-Clock Sleep Trainer</h3>

      </p>

      <p>There's a choice of five lullabies that will hopefully sooth your baby to sleep.</p>
      <p>You also have a range of 250m outdoors - so you could probably get to the bottom of the garden, though not all the way down the road.</p>
      <p>There's money off right now at Amazon.</p>
      <p> </p>
