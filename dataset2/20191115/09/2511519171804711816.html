      <p>After <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/england-football-0">England</a> thrashed Montenegro 7-0 at Wembley to secure their spot at the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Euro_2020">Euro 2020</a> finals, a number of places across <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/GarethSouthgate">Gareth Southgate</a>‘s squad remain in contention.</p>
      <p>The exciting contingent of young players, spearheaded by <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/marcus-rashford">Marcus Rashford</a> and followed by Trent Alexander-Arnold, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/jadon-sancho">Jadon Sancho</a>, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/callum-hudson-odoi">Callum Hudson-Odoi</a>, Declan Rice and now Tammy Abraham all look relatively assured of their positions if they can sustain their form.</p>
      <p>Kyle Walker, Dele Alli, Michael Keane and Kieran Trippier have all fallen into a bracket of uncertainty, with the likes of <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/james-maddison">James Maddison</a>, Fikayo Tomori, Tyrone Mings and Aaron Wan-Bissaka all making their own convincing bids for a position.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, in the middle ground are figures like <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Alex_Oxlade-Chamberlain">Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain</a> and Harry Winks, who’ve seen their progress waver due to injury, but clearly boast the ability to be part of the 23-man squad, while Callum Wilson and Danny Rose are teetering out of favour under the manager.</p>
      <p>Here are the players we believe are currently on track to make Southgate’s squad:</p>
