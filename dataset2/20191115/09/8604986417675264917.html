      <p><a href="https://www.inc.com/srikumar-rao/video-marketing-tips.html">Video has changed</a> the way brands market to their audiences. Since video marketing has come into play, businesses have seen increased conversions across the board. What's even more intriguing is that consumers are increasingly interested in <a href="https://www.inc.com/amy-balliett/want-to-create-a-viral-worthy-video-here-are-5-essential-strategies-that-you-need.html">video blogging, or vlogging</a>. </p>
      <p>Vlogs take regular blog content and turn it into <a href="https://www.inc.com/amy-balliett/want-to-create-a-viral-worthy-video-here-are-5-essential-strategies-that-you-need.html">video content</a>. In a Statista survey, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/961139/average-number-vloggers-adults-watch-each-week-usa-age/">32 percent</a> of participants aged 18 to 34 said they watch at least three vlogs per week. As vlogs continue to gain traction and favorability from viewers, your brand can use vlogging to better cater to its audience and boost engagement.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, not everyone is aware of the benefits of vlogging and how it helps businesses drive conversions and achieve their goals. Through video blogs, your brand has the opportunity to turn a boring, static experience into a fun, engaging one. </p>
      <p>Let's look at three reasons your business needs to start creating vlog content today.</p>
      <h3>1. It creates a personalized experience.</h3>
      <p>With video, it's easier for your audience to enjoy a personalized experience from your brand. Most businesses only get as personal as their "about me" sections or static images of their teams. This helps your audience get to know you better, but there are ways to personalize the experience further with video.</p>
      <p>Use vlogging to let viewers see your day-to-day life, business operations and whatever other content you want to show them. It's something they don't always get to see, so it adds a special touch to the experience.</p>
      <p>When you combine video with blogging, it further humanizes your brand and makes viewers feel connected to you. Mirror a one-on-one conversation where both parties are intentionally engaged. For brands with larger audiences especially, it's a great way to form a connection with consumers and urge them to invest in your business. </p>
      <h3>2. It promotes your content.</h3>
      <p>Since people already love to consume video, you can use this to your advantage by hyping up your content. Videos are a great way to give your audience a better look at your products so they can learn about your brand and make an informed buying decision. </p>
      <p>Use vlogging to introduce and promote new content and products. Tell users why they need to have them, and make sure to list the benefits they get in doing so. If you only discuss features of a product or service, it doesn't articulate how it helps your audience. Tell them how your content resolves their issues, offers solutions and caters to their interests. </p>
      <p>When our company comes out with a new, exciting feature, we turn to video to promote it. Doing so results in more traffic driven to our website, increased sales and more user engagement. They give us a better way to inform and educate viewers so they can make a purchasing decision they feel confident about.</p>
      <p>Even when your main goal is to produce conversions, video marketing makes it possible to market to consumers without making it feel like a sales pitch. In your vlogs, avoid sales talk, and doesn't push viewers to do anything -- it makes it that much more effective.</p>
      <h3>3. It drives action.</h3>
      <p>Guide your viewers through your videos, and tell them what they should do to stay in touch with your business. Too many video creators neglect the opportunity to use video to drive action and increase conversions on their websites. Or, they wait until the end of their videos to insert calls to action.</p>
      <p>Use calls to action early in your content to increase conversions, improve engagement, drive sales and much more. Most consumers avoid promotional content and aren't interested in traditional advertisements. We live in an ad-saturated world that's nearly impossible to get away from. So, if you can change the way consumers see your brand, it makes all the difference.</p>
      <p>Because vlogging offers personalization, it's easier to persuade viewers to take action so your business sees results. If you produce video content that users find engaging, useful and valuable, they're likely to adhere to your CTAs and drive conversions. </p>
      <h3>It's your turn.</h3>
      <p>Vlogging increases in popularity and views by the day as more consumers prefer personalized interaction. If you've never created video or vlog content for your business before, it's time to use it to your advantage. </p>
