      <p>The World Bank has welcomed the "successful first reading" of a bill on farmland sale in Ukraine.</p>
      <p>"The World Bank Group congratulates the Ukrainian Leadership on the successful first reading of the law to lift the moratorium on agricultural land sales," it <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WorldBankUkraine/posts/2149492632024069?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARBL_tLa53SdbBesf0pAnCU8ONc7EEXVV4rWMqlthQp7gW0RRwfeHYV5PIqFWmUlWL8JsJF3XFerm3MQDldTTdhTdcVY7F2YWjc-fvkCKCGUAx7uJnciUjI3thGYvlKiPT3snYLmiMl-T_LRIt8hHA_erWrQLCK8DusZJbajhUBEyQH9_vEyNdnStyy7itvWsSwNN7jVkcwzZWUzgY39oUcAHEFWuWMdZMO7lxdXS8S7KWdbF8Lic1muuSxFCu8Yv7f2tUcHvnpoYu4BjruEgjk14OQVkYNEnT__kLA5wxMUBBBwpaMOa2A9gR4Eht05A05nbVnwt5fBf3hOn_w8H5PY&amp;__tn__=-R">said in a statement on Facebook</a> on November 13. "This was an important first step towards the opening of the agricultural land market and unleashing Ukraineâ€™s agricultural potential to the benefit of all Ukrainians."</p>
      <p>"We look forward to the positive adoption of the law, and passage of the accompanying laws that prevent concentration of land ownership and ensure transparency," the World Bank added.</p>
      <p>As UNIAN reported earlier, a bill designed to launch the farmland market in Ukraine from October 1, 2020, passed its first reading on November 13.</p>
      <p>According to World Bank forecasts, the opening of the agricultural land market may annually inject an additional US$700 million to US$1.5 billion into the Ukrainian economy.</p>
