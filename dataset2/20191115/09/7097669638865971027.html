      <p>HONG KONG (AP) — The Latest on the protests in Hong Kong (all times local):</p>
      <p>8 p.m.</p>
      <p>Protesters in Hong Kong have once again blocked a highway in an outlying area after the government did not meet their demand that it pledge to go ahead with local elections later this month.</p>
      <p>Traffic was backed up Friday evening after the protesters placed barricades back on the roadway.</p>
      <p>The protesters had allowed one lane of traffic to re-open in each direction and gave the government 24 hours to meet their demand.</p>
      <p>Constitutional Affairs Secretary Patrick Nip said the government hopes the election will be held on schedule but warned that it could be postponed if conditions are unsafe and roads and other transportation are blocked.</p>
