      <p>Coming fresh from a buzzworthy collaboration with Young Thug and Travis Scott, Gunna has linked up with electronic dance music producer NGHTMRE for the enthralling new single and video for “CASH COW.”</p>
      <p>NGHTMRE has a history of venturing into Hip Hop. This past year, he’s teamed up with high profile rappers such as Lil Jon and A$AP Ferg. He tells HipHopDX since he grew up in the South, he has always felt highly influenced by the Atlanta scene. In regards to joining forces with Gunna, he stated, “Working with someone as dope as Gunna in the studio was a dream come true for me. Working to create something he really loved was a fun process.”</p>
      <p>After listening to the beat, Gunna wrote all of his verses during a single flash of creativity.</p>

      <p>This single caps off a momentous year for the Atlanta rapper. Back in February, Gunna released the well-received Drip or Down 2 and he’s recently worked with chart-topping artists such as Chris Brown, Jacquees, French Montana and Moneybagg Yo.</p>
