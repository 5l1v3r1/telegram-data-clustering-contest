      <h3>EVERYBODY knows that every year, natural disasters, like typhoons, storms and floods, claim the lives of many people and destroy billions of pesos worth of agricultural crops and property.</h3>
      <p>Knowing full well the many adverse effects of catastrophic calamities, concerned government authorities, we think, ought to come up with highly-effective measures to address the problem.</p>
      <p>The Philippines, one of the world’s favorite “sparring partners” of destructive weather disturbances, is on the right track in setting up a chain of disaster forecasting and early warning centers.</p>
      <p>Every year, an average of 20 typhoons and storms, a number of them destructive, batters the country, worrying people, notably the poor, living or working in low-lying and flood-prone communities.</p>
      <p>The Green Climate Fund (GCF), an international fund, has provided a $10-million grant to the Philippines to finance the setting up of a forecasting and early warning system for natural disasters.</p>
      <p>The target sites include Tuguegarao City, Cagayan; Legazpi City, Albay; Palo, Leyte; and New Bataan, Davao de Oro, according to Commissioner Rachel Herrera of the Climate Change Commission (CCC).</p>
      <p>“The project aims to translate hazard forecasts into warnings that can convey location and sector-specific impacts, providing tailored climate risk information directly to LGUs and communities,” she said.</p>
      <p>The fund, around P500 million, will be channeled to the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP).</p>
      <p>PAG-ASA heads the project, along with the Department of the Interior and Local Government, Department of Environment and Natural Resources, Office of Civil Defense and World Food Program.</p>
      <p>We share the view of House Deputy Speaker Loren Legarda that lessons learned from Typhoon Yolanda necessitated the need for a project that can translate risk and hazard information into understandable and actionable early warning. Legarda is an alternate member of the GCF board.</p>
      <p>With the worsening of climate change, we have no choice but to set up an effective disaster early warning system.</p>
