      <h1>General Motors could turn Hamtramck into its electric pickup, SUV hub</h1>
      <h2>The factory will stay open, and receive a $3 billion investment</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T09:50:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 09:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.autoblog.com/bloggers/ronan-glon/" target="_blank">Ronan Glon</a></address>
      <p>Electric off-roaders could revitalize the Detroit-Hamtramck factory that <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/category/gm/">General Motors</a> previously announced it will close. While official details remain shrouded in secrecy, analysts believe the plant will be re-tooled to manufacture at least three electric models due out during the early 2020s.</p>
      <p>The plant's scheduled closure was one of the grievances the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/category/uaw-unions/">United Auto Workers</a> (<a href="https://www.autoblog.com/category/uaw-unions/">UAW</a>) union cited when it embarked on <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/10/25/uaw-strike-vote/">a 40-day strike</a> in September 2019. General Motors agreed to keep it open without shedding much light on what it planned to build there. Analyst at LMC Automotive told the <i><a href="https://eu.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/general-motors/2019/11/14/forecast-firm-says-gm-will-build-electric-sierra-escalade-detroit-hamtramck-plant/4196250002/">The Detroit News</a></i> they believe an often-rumored electric SUV that will resurrect <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/hummer/">Hummer's</a> name, image, or both will be one of the models assigned to the Hamtramck plant. Battery-powered variants of the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/gmc/">GMC</a> Sierra and the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/cadillac/escalade/">Cadillac Escalade</a> will be made there, too, as will an enigmatic van.</p>
      <p>LMC Automotive's Jeff Schuster believes the van will come first; it could enter production as early as 2021. The Hummer — which might also be offered as a pickup — will follow before the end of 2022, while the Sierra and the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/cadillac/escalade/">Escalade</a> will both arrive in 2023. We're taking this report with a grain of salt, though, because only one of the aforementioned models has been announced by General Motors.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/06/17/electric-hummer-gm/">Rumors of a Hummer resurrection</a> emerged in the summer of 2019, just a few weeks before we heard unverified reports of a battery-powered variant of the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/10/03/cadillac-escalade-spied-grille-uncovered/">next-generation Escalade</a>. General Motors confirmed plans to enter <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/09/13/ford-gm-electric-pickup-trucks/">the burgeoning electric pickup truck segment</a>, which <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/ford/">Ford</a>, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/09/30/rivian-shown-blue-paint-truck/">Rivian</a>, and <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/tesla/">Tesla</a> also have their sights on, but it hasn't detailed how or when. The van is a mystery.</p>
      <p>General Motors refused to comment on the report. It previously announced it will keep Hamtramck open, and invest $3 billion to build <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/electric/">electric vehicles</a> there. The investment will create 2,225 jobs.</p>
      <p>Inaugurated in February 1985, the Hamtramck factory has churned out a diverse selection of models over the past 34 years, including <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/cadillac/eldorado/">Cadillac's Eldorado</a>, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/cadillac/seville/">Seville</a>, and Allanté, the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/oldsmobile/">Oldsmobile</a> Toronado, the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/buick/riviera/">Buick Riviera</a>, and more recently, gasoline-electric <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/chevrolet/volt/">Chevrolet Volt</a>. General Motors announced plans to close Hamtramck in 2018, but it quickly backpedaled and extended its <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/tag/leasing/">lease</a> on life until 2020 by keeping the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/09/25/chevy-impala-final-year-2020-price-trims/">Chevrolet Impala</a> and the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/08/05/2020-cadillac-ct6-v-first-drive-review/">Cadillac CT6</a> around for a few additional months.</p>
