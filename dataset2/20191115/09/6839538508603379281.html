      <p>The pass, stretching from Milsons Point to Barangaroo, is a crucial part of the government’s massive transport pipeline.</p>
      <p>Incredible animations of the Metro tunnels show commuters walking through shops and cafes dotted through the futuristic station.</p>
      <p>“Next month we will be able to walk not on top of the Harbour but 50m under,” Ms Berejiklian said.</p>
      <p>In her speech, Ms Berejiklian paid tribute to John Bradfield, the pioneer behind the</p>
      <p>Sydney Harbour Bridge and his secretary, Kathleen, saying they would be proud of the news.</p>

      <p>The Premier also unveiled her vision for Sydney’s future as a world-leader in manufacturing driven by the Western Sydney Aerotropolis.</p>
      <p>“I want to make NSW the most advanced manufacturing capital of the region and that’s going to be possible because of the Aerotropolis,” she said.</p>
      <p>Ms Berejiklian launched a call to action, saying that the city’s future rests on bold decision-making, with the city’s biggest challenge a talent shortage.</p>

      <p>“Capital isn’t the biggest challenge faced in delivering the infrastructure program. It’s capacity to get enough people with skills to look at the program. We need to make sure we have the next pipeline of project managers and highly skilled people to work on the machinery.”</p>
      <p>Ms Berejiklian ended her speech with thanks to The Daily Telegraph for bringing discussions about the state’s future to the fore.</p>
      <h3>JAMES PACKER PLEDGES $1M TO AID RURAL FIRE SERVICE</h3>
      <p>Billionaire James Packer has pledged to donate $1 million to help NSW’s hardworking firefighters in the wake of the state’s devastating bushfires.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the Bradfield Oration today, Daily Telegraph editor Ben English revealed Mr Packer on Thursday had pledged $1 million over the next five years to boost Rural Fire Services’ resources and buy new firefighting equipment.</p>
      <p>The equipment should be dubbed “Packer Splashers,” Mr English said.</p>
      <p>“We like everybody are touched by the tragedies and bravery occurring daily, which your paper continues to bring to life so well. It is a pleasure to make this modest contribution,” Mr Packer said.</p>

      <p>Commemorating the legacy of Dr John Bradfield, a visionary Australian engineer, The Daily Telegraph’s 2019 Bradfield Oration brings the best and brightest in planning, industry and politics together to probe the challenges facing Sydney and explore potential solutions.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison earlier addressed the audience, sharing how Bradfield had informed his own views on building great cities.</p>
      <p>“I’m a Sydneysider so like Bradfield I have a practical eye for the future. One that aims to unlock Sydney and all of its potential as a great global city,” he said.</p>
      <p>“The oration I gave last year pointed out how John Bradfield focused on building infrastructure as public monuments. He wanted infrastructure to do a job and serve people and we see that everyday in the Harbour Bridge and the City Circle he also built.</p>
      <p>“Bradfield understood cities must always have an eye for the future.”</p>

      <p>Working closely with the State Government to breathe new life into the city was the government’s top priority, he said.</p>
      <p>“As PM it’s not my job to be chief architect but as PM I can use the levers I have to drive forward big nation building projects working closely with state and territory governments and with a $100 billion infrastructure pipeline over next 10 years that’s exactly what we’re doing.</p>
      <p>“We’re improving the nation’s roads, investing in big rail projects, the new airport in Western Sydney, we’re busting congestion and managing population growth in cities just as Bradfield would want us to be doing.”</p>

      <p>The event featured American “uber-geographer” Joel Kotkin and the former Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett and aimed to drive discussions about the city’s future.</p>
      <p>From the transport, housing and public infrastructure needed to keep pace with an unprecedented population boom to keeping the city’s night-life alive, the event will explore ways to help Sydney sustain growth and retain its position as a world-leading city.</p>
      <p>Leveraging the tech revolution to future-proof the city and realising its tourism potential in an increasingly globalised world will also be front of mind.</p>
