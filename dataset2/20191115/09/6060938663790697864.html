      <h1>I will never hold a grudge against my 'idol' Mary Kom: Nikhat Zareen</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T09:21:54+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 09:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-Amit-Kumar-479252604.cms" target="_blank">Amit Kumar</a></address>
      <p>NEW DELHI: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Nikhat-Zareen">Nikhat Zareen</a> is busy sparring with her team-mates and coaches these days. A rigorous training module, sparring sessions, pep talks by coaches and trainers, a strict diet chart and some hours of sleep – this is Nikhat’s everyday schedule. The 23-year-old is preparing for a big challenge and eagerly waiting for the day when she will face six-time World Champion and Olympic medallist MC <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/mary-kom">Mary Kom</a> in the trials (51kg) for the 2020 <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Tokyo-Olympics">Tokyo Olympics</a> qualifiers. The trials are scheduled in the last week of December.</p>
      <p>“I am happy. When I got the email from Jay Kowli sir (BFI secretary general), I was elated. I was happy with the decision I fought for. I also sent a thank-you email to them,” Nikhat told Timesofindia.com in an exclusive interview.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the World <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Boxing">Boxing</a> Championships, the BFI had a selection policy for both the male and female boxers. According to the policy, Indian women boxers, who won the gold and silver medals at the World Championships, would get direct entry into the Olympic qualifiers,but not the bronze-medal winners. The qualifiers are scheduled to be held in Wuhan from February 3 to 14.</p>
      <p>But the Mary-Nikhat verbal war erupted when the BFI President Ajay Singh hinted that all the medal winners (at the World Championships) will get direct entry for the qualifiers. Mary had won a bronze at the World Championships.</p>
      <p>This is what forced Nikhat, a bronze-medal winner at the 2019 Asian Championships, to write a letter to Union Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju, requesting for a trial bout against Mary Kom for the women's 51kg category. The 23-year-old Nikhat had also put up the letter on her twitter handle.</p>
      <p>“My hard work paid off. There is a saying ‘truth always win’. I was fighting for the truth and I won. I want to thank the BFI, Kiren Rijiju sir and all who supported me. I just wanted trials to happen and now my focus is on training and practice for the big challenge. That's my ultimate goal,” Nikhat said.</p>
      <p>“Training is going on full swing. There is no pressure on me. I just want to go and perform. I want to give my 100 percent and put in my best game. Everyone enters the ring with a winning mindset. I will also go with the same intention when I face Mary Kom. I want to show my best skills in the ring. I am not under any pressure,” the 23-year-old said.</p>
      <p>Nikhat, who had lost to Mary Kom in the semis of India Open in May earlier this year, is vying for a spot in the Olympic qualifiers to be held in February 2020.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know whether Mary will be under pressure or not. But I am not under any sort of pressure. She (Mary) is a legend and has a lot of experience.” Nikhat said.</p>
      <p>“I don’t have any special plan against her (Mary). I lost to her at the India Open. I don’t want to repeat the mistakes I committed at the India Open. I will again go back and watch that video and will learn from that. I want to go with a winning, confident and free mind against Mary,” the Indian boxer said.</p>
      <p>Despite several verbal exchanges and drama, Nikhat says Mary will always be her inspiration and idol, no matter what. She doesn’t want to hold any grudge against her and, as a young boxer, will always look to learn from the London Olympics bronze medallist.</p>
      <p>“If you talk about me, I would say she will always remain my role model and idol. I will always respect her. I have learnt a lot from her. I will never hold a grudge against her. But I don’t know about her and how she will react from now on,” she said.</p>
      <p>“After 2020 Olympics, she (Mary) may retire. I will definitely be in touch with her and keep taking boxing tips. There is no hate from my side. I also want to represent my country the way Mary Kom has," Nikhat signed off.</p>
