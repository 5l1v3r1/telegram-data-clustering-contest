      <p>Garden waste charges will remain, despite a pledge in 2015 calling for them to be removed.</p>
      <p>Speaking a meeting of Mid Devon District Council on Wednesday, November 6, Councillor Clive Eginton (Taw Vale, Conservative) questioned a local election leaflet from Councillor Alex White (Upper Yeo, Liberal Democrats) from 2015.</p>
      <p>He said: “I refer to the leaflet, Focus on Taw Vale Ward when Cllr White was the district council candidate for the Liberal Democrats in the 2015 elections, standing against myself and a Green candidate under the heading ‘bin the garden tax’.</p>
      <p>“It says ‘the Tories want to charge £50 to have our garden waste collected, only by voting for Alex White can you get a local voice opposed to the garden tax.’  Furthermore, it tells us a petition will be presented to the Council. </p>
      <p>“Given that, for a 240L brown bin the cost is £49 for the current financial year, can you now accept that under the previous Conservative administration, at no point has a £50 charge be levied.”</p>

      <p>Cllr White responded: “You’re correct. I’m sure Cllr Eginton won’t mind me saying about it as he came up to me and said ‘you’ve been sold a pup. Under no circumstances are we going to charge the residents of Mid Devon £50. Absolutely not.’</p>
      <p>“And what was the charge? £49. You are correct; it wasn’t £50. Indeed, I can accept the charge wasn’t £50.”</p>
      <p>Cllr Eginton pointed out that the original charge was £45, which is now £49.</p>
      <p>Cllr White added that there was ‘a big movement’ in favour of not charging for the collection.</p>
      <p>“We collected in the region of around 3000 signatures, so it was quite a lot.</p>
      <p>“Whether or not it was presented to the Council, I am not aware as I was not the person leading on the petition. If you say it wasn’t presented, then it wasn’t presented.”</p>
      <p>Cllr Egiton then asked: “Since the scheme was introduced in September 2015, the income to this Council has been £1.634million.</p>
      <p>“Will you now admit you were wrong to oppose the garden waste charge scheme, or if you were not wrong, how would you have replaced this income to the Council over the last four years and in the future?”</p>
      <p>Cllr White responded: “The scheme has raised funds for the Council I can agree with that and times have been extremely tight because we have been dealing with Tory austerity for the last four years.</p>
      <p>“The Council does need to raise tax to be able to balance our books, and it’s extremely important that we are fiscally responsible, and this Cabinet is going to be so.</p>
      <p>“Having viewed the financial position that we are in, then, we do need to continue charging the green tax. For me, that is a great regret as I would have loved to have seen no charge for it to promote more people to recycle their garden waste.” </p>
