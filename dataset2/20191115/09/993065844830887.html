      <p>Nadine Coyle said she has not spoken to her former Girls Aloud band mates for a couple of years, with the exception of Sarah Harding.</p>

      <p>She told the Daily Mirror: “I haven’t seen or spoken to them since the end of Girls Aloud or just before I had my daughter. That’s about six years ago.</p>
      <p>“Sarah more recently at the start of Big Brother”.</p>
      <p>Harding was named the winner of Celebrity Big Brother in August 2017.</p>
      <p>Mother-of-one Coyle said she was not sure if the former Girls Aloud band members – which included Harding, Cheryl, Nicola Roberts and Kimberley Walsh – would vote for her to do Bushtucker Trials.</p>
      <p>She told the paper: “I’m not even thinking about it as a competition. I had to enter a singing competition to get into Girls Aloud whereas this is like who’s going to be the best jungler. Who makes the best fire, who makes the best water. I have no idea if they would vote for me.”</p>
      <p>Girls Aloud was created during TV talent show Popstars: The Rivals in 2002.</p>
      <p>The band went on to enjoy numerous chart and album successes before going on a break in 2009 and then splitting in 2013.</p>

      <p>Ahead of her jungle stint, Coyle, whose daughter Anaiya is five, has admitted that her phobias are:  “Heights, rats, snakes – everything!”.</p>
      <p>Other celebrities heading into the jungle include American TV star Caitlyn Jenner, former footballer Ian Wright, TV presenter Kate Garraway and actress Jacqueline Jossa.</p>
      <p>I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! starts on Sunday November 17 at 9pm on ITV.</p>
