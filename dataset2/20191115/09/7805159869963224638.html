      <h1>Search Result Data Made Easy With Serpstack</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T09:03:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 09:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/a-word-from-our-sponsors/" target="_blank">A Word From Our Sponsors</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://serpstack.com/">serpstack</a> is a tool that provides valuable information about search results. “SERP” is an acronym that stands for Search Engine Results Page. What <a href="https://serpstack.com/">serpstack</a> can do is search for a query and then scrape the results page. As anyone who runs a website that relies on search engine traffic will tell you, this can be incredibly useful data.</p>
      <p>With the SERP API you can perform searches across multiple search engines. And since a lot of search engines now cater results to the user, it can be hard to predict what other people will see. With the SERP API you can make the queries comes from different devices and countries, so you know what all users are seeing.</p>
      <p>There are tools out there that can show where your website ranks on search engines, but serpstack goes above and beyond that. Not only can you see where you rank, but you can also see what is ranking above and below you. You can also see how those results are changing over time to see what other sites are doing around you.</p>
      <p>It goes without saying that this information can be very useful for marketing campaigns. It’s important to see where your site ranks with specific terms. serpstack also gives you the ability to see what other sites around your rank are showing to bring in visitors, which can help your approach as well.</p>
      <h3>Getting Started</h3>
      <p>Getting up and running with the serpstack API is very easy. First, you will head to the <a href="https://serpstack.com/">serpstack</a> website and sign up for a plan (pricing info below). Once you’ve signed up you will get an API key. The other thing you’ll need to get started is a specific term you want to search for. All of this can be done from the browser. With the API key and a search term in hand, you can use this URL:</p>
      <p>
        <code>https://api.serpstack.com/search?access_key=YOUR_API_KEY&amp;query=SEARCHTERM</code>
      </p>
      <p>The results will show up in the JSON format, so you’ll probably want to use a browser extension such as <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-viewer/gbmdgpbipfallnflgajpaliibnhdgobh?hl=en">JSON Viewer</a> to make it easier to read. This is just the tip of the iceberg of what serpstack can do. By default, Google is the search engine, but this can be changed by adding a parameter to the URL above. Similarly, you can add a parameter to change the country where the search is performed. Here are some example parameters:</p>

      <h3>Pricing</h3>
      <p>serpstack offers a free tier with some limitations. You can only do 100 requests per month, results are only in JSON, and there’s no HTTPS support. If you only want to dip your toes in, this is a good place to start.</p>
      <p>The Basic tier removes the rate limits, bumps up to 5,000 searches per month, adds HTTPS encryption, and enables results in CSV format. Basic costs $29.99 per month or $23.99 per month if you pay yearly.</p>
      <p>The Business and Business Pro tiers include the features from the Basic tier, but the searches are bumped up to 20,000 and 50,000 respectively. Business costs $99.99 per month or $79.99 per month if you pay yearly. Business Pro costs either $199.99 monthly or $159.99 per month if paid yearly.
