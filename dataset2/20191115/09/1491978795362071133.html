        <i>Kurdish-Iranian asylum seeker arrives in Christchurch for a literary festival</i>
      </p>
      <p>New Zealand’s immigration service has said the Kurdish-Iranian asylum seeker and journalist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/behrouz-boochani">Behrouz Boochani</a> will not get special treatment if he overstays his visitor visa.</p>
      <p>Boochani <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/15/behrouz-boochani-calls-christchurch-welcome-a-reminder-of-kindness">arrived in Christchurch on Friday</a> to attend a literary festival after leaving Australia’s Manus Island detention centre in Papua New Guinea on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The office of the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, refused to comment on Boochani’s arrival and referred all inquiries regarding his status to Immigration <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/newzealand">New Zealand</a>. The immigration minister, Iain Lees-Galloways, also refused to comment on the case.</p>
      <p>Greg Patchell, the deputy chief executive of Immigration New Zealand, said Boochani was a recognised refugee with UNHCR status but had already been accepted for resettlement by the US and would be staying only temporarily in New Zealand.</p>
      <p>“He is in New Zealand on a one-month limited visa for the specific purpose of speaking at a conference in Christchurch. He must depart before his visa expires,” Patchell said. “He is fully sponsored by Amnesty International who are responsible for meeting all his costs.</p>
      <p>“If he claims asylum in New Zealand, an independent statutory process decides his claim. Government ministers have no role in this process.”</p>
      <p>Patchell said Boochani’s visitor visa had been granted only because officials were satisfied that he “genuinely intends a temporary stay in New Zealand”.</p>
      <p>Boochani has yet to formally apply for asylum in New Zealand and says he wants a few days to adjust to his freedom before engaging in any formal process with the government.</p>
      <p>However, he has vowed never to return to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/manus-island">Manus Island</a>, telling the Guardian: “I will never go back there.”</p>
      <p>He said: “I want to be free just for a while. As a writer, nothing else. I don’t want to be a part of a process for a while.”</p>
      <p>Boochani, who is elated but weary after a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/14/a-long-flight-to-freedom-how-refugee-behrouz-boochani-finally-left-his-island-jail-behind">34-hour journey across six timezones</a> in the Asia-Pacific, thanked the people of New Zealand for welcoming him, saying it was “an honour to be here … and a reminder of kindness”.</p>
      <p>For six years, New Zealand has had a standing offer to resettle 150 refugees a year from the offshore processing islands of Manus and Nauru, but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/nov/01/decision-to-bring-children-from-nauru-an-admission-of-failure-by-government">Australia has consistently rebuffed the offer</a>.</p>
      <p>Under the Ardern government New Zealand has committed to increase its refugee quota from 1,000 a year to 1,500 by the middle of next year.</p>
      <p>Boochani arrived by boat on Christmas Island in July 2013 and was sent to Manus Island a month later.</p>
      <p>While in detention, Boochani wrote a book, No Friend but the Mountains: Writing from Manus Prison, which won this year’s Victorian Prize for Literature and the National Biography Award, Australia’s richest literary prize.</p>
      <p>He also filmed a documentary of life in the Manus centre on a mobile phone, which has been seen in Australia, London and Berlin.</p>
