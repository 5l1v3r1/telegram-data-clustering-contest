      <p><a href="https://www.autoblog.com/bmw/">BMW's</a> answer to the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/tesla/model+3/">Tesla Model 3</a> will arrive in the early 2020s, likely wearing the i4 nameplate. Previewed by the polarizing <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2017/09/12/bmws-i-vision-dynamics-concept-shows-a-2020s-four-door-electric/">i Vision Dynamics concept</a> (pictured), it will be an electric-only sedan packed with forward-thinking tech features, and built with composite materials to keep weight in check. We have a better idea of what to expect from its specifications sheet thanks to a recent report.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/10/21/bmw-i4-ev-spied-production-body/">i4</a> will come with an 80-kilowatt-hour, lithium-ion battery pack in its standard configuration, and it will offer <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/bmw/530/">530</a> horsepower, according to unnamed sources who spoke to <i><a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/2021-bmw-i4-official-details/">Roadshow</a></i>. That's enough for a four-second sprint from 0-62 mph, and its top speed will be electronically limited to 120 mph. </p>
      <p>New battery technology will help keep range anxiety in check. The i4 will drive for up to 373 miles on a single charge, though that figure was obtained using the optimistic WLTP testing cycle. Plugging it into a 150-kilowatt DC quick charger will juice its battery pack with an 80 percent charge in 35 minutes; alternatively, it will take about six minutes to channel 62 miles of range into the pack.</p>
      <p><i>Roadshow</i> learned additional variants — including some with more power, and/or more range — will join the line-up a little bit later in the production run, so the i4 could reach <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/08/21/2019-bmw-m5-competition-review/">M5</a>-like levels of power. All of them will be built on the same modular platform found under <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2018/12/11/2019-bmw-330i-review-first-drive/">the new 3 Series</a>. It was developed with multiple drivetrains in mind to save the firm from designing separate architectures for gasoline- and electric-powered vehicles. <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/09/10/bmw-concept-4-frankfurt-motor-show/">The next-generation 4 Series</a> will also use this foundation.</p>
      <p>BMW is expected to reveal the i4 — assuming that's what it will be called — in late 2020, and production will begin in Munich, Germany, during the first half of 2021. When it lands, it will <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/03/25/bmw-inext-i4-ix3-shown-ev/">join</a> the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2018/08/31/bmw-ix3-ev-spy-photos/">iX3</a> (which is, as its name implies, an electric variant of <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2018/02/21/2018-bmw-x3-xdrive30i-review-quick-spin/">the current X3</a>) and the production version of the battery-powered iNext concept in showrooms.</p>
