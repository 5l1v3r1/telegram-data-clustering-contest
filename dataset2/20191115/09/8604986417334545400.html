      <h2>The billionaire creator of Star Wars, and founder of Lucasfilm and ILM, says lasting success can be built on one key attribute.</h2>

      <p>You're Dave Filoni, a kid from Pittsburgh who loves animation. And, not coincidentally, <a href="https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/the-final-trailer-for-star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-just-dropped-fans-have-all-kinds-of-feelings.html"><i>Star Wars</i></a>.</p>
      <p>So, in time, you find yourself working as a story artist and director on a Nickelodeon show<i>. </i>It's a great job. While you're not living <i>the</i> dream, you're definitely living <i>a</i> dream. </p>
      <p>Then you get the call: <a href="https://www.inc.com/benjamin-p-hardy/the-most-important-lesson-george-lucas-taught-his-.html">George Lucas</a>, creator of the <i>Indiana Jones</i> and <i>Star Wars</i> franchises, and founder of LucasArts, Industrial Light &amp; Magic, and Lucasfilm, wants to interview you for a job.</p>
      <p>At first, you think someone at <i>SpongeBob SquarePants </i>is playing a practical joke<i>.</i> </p>
      <p>Then you realize the call is real. And to your surprise, you land the job.</p>
      <p>Not only do you help create <i>The Clone Wars</i> animated series, but when Lucas sells Lucasfilm to Disney (for a not too shabby $4 billion), you go on to create animated shows like <i>Rebels</i> and <i>Resistance. </i>And now you're an executive producer and director of the live-action series <i>The Mandalorian, </i>a major tent pole of the new <a href="https://www.inc.com/don-reisinger/heres-how-to-get-disney-plus-free-for-one-year.html">Disney Plus</a> streaming service.</p>
      <p>In an industry where talent -- both in front of and behind the camera -- tends to come and go at an alarming rate, how did Filoni become a lasting player in the franchise's <br/>ecosystem?</p>
      <p>As <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/11/dave-filoni-george-lucas-star-wars">Filoni says</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>"One day, George said, 'Do you know why I enjoy working with you?' And I said, 'No, I have no idea.'<br/><br/>He said, 'Well, you listen to me.'<br/><br/>A lot of people think you need to come and impress someone. They think, I'm going to show you or do better. They don't always think you impress somebody by listening."</blockquote>
      <p>Lucas clearly agreed. While flexibility, collaboration, and imagination <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sydneyfinkelstein/2015/12/16/george-lucas-management-guru/#4a6db8a04fa7">were obviously required</a>, Lucas looked for more.</p>
      <p>When asked about Filoni, he <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/11/dave-filoni-george-lucas-star-wars">said</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>"I immediately found (Filoni) to be very open-minded and a great listener, which are qualities I admire because it opens a person up to new experiences. <br/><br/>(The key is to) stay open-minded and realize that there's still a lot to learn.<br/><br/>There's always something to learn."</blockquote>
      <p>True. But in order to learn, you first have to listen -- even though, in many situations, listening more than you talk is hard.</p>
      <p>Take interviewing: job candidates who listen more than they talk may fail to fully detail their skill, experience, and qualifications for the job.</p>
      <p>Or trying to land a new client: listen more than you talk, and you may never get the chance to describe why your company, your products, or your services are the best option.</p>
      <p>But if you don't listen, you'll "sell" what <i>you</i> want to sell instead of what the other person really needs.</p>
      <h3>Listen more.</h3>
      <p>Want to be a better listener? Start by listening at least twice as much as you speak. (Three times as much is better.)</p>
      <p>How? Ask simple questions. Then make eye contact, smile if you agree, look puzzled if you're confused, respond nonverbally. That's all it takes to show you're really listening -- and to encourage the other person to continue. </p>
      <p>Then, when you do speak, ask clarifying questions. Ask how. Or why. Or how something felt. Or why something mattered.</p>
      <p>Only speak when you have something important to say.</p>
      <p>And never forget that your advice, no matter how badly you want to give it, is rarely important. Always define "important" as what matters to the other person.</p>
      <p>Not you.</p>
      <p>Which means never giving advice unless asked, because offering advice when you weren't asked immediately shifts the focus of the conversation onto you. </p>
      <h3>Listen slowly.</h3>
      <p>Sometimes, instead of asking questions, the best conversational technique is to listen slowly.</p>
      <p>In <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Change-Friendly-Leadership-Transform-Intentions-Performance/dp/0985213507/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=03065-20&amp;qid=1336071859&amp;sr=8-1">Change-Friendly Leadership</a></i>, management coach <a href="http://www.doctorduncan.com/">Rodger Dean Duncan</a> describes how he learned about listening slowly from <i>PBS NewsHour</i> anchor <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/aboutus/bio_lehrer.html">Jim Lehrer</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>"He urged me to ask a good question, listen attentively to the answer, and then count silently to five before asking another question. <br/><br/>At first that suggestion seemed silly. I argued that five seconds would seem like an eternity to wait after someone responds to a question. Then it occurred to me: Of course it would seem like an eternity, because our natural tendency is to fill a void with sound, usually that of our own voice."</blockquote>
      <p>Duncan quickly realized that resisting the temptation to respond too quickly to the answer allowed the other person room to expand on what they had already said, or go in a different direction. </p>
      <p>Giving the conversation room to breathe made people more willing to disclose, explore, and even be a little more vulnerable.</p>
      <p>Try it. The next time you interview someone, or try to land a new client, or ask someone to share their ideas, in effect, the next time you have any kind of conversation, listen slowly. </p>
      <p>Those pauses will result in your learning more: additional examples, fuller explanations, different perspectives.</p>
      <p>And even if that doesn't happen, this will: By listening more, and listening slowly, you'll make the other person feel more respected.</p>
      <p>More important.</p>
      <p>More valued. </p>
      <p>Which is the perfect outcome for any conversation.</p>
