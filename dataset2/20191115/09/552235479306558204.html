      <p>A man has been jailed for nearly a year after rocks were thrown at the living room window of a Hamilton house.</p>
      <p>The missiles smashed the glass and narrowly missed the occupants of the room.</p>
      <p>William Shanks, 27, a prisoner, was sentenced at Hamilton Sheriff Court on Friday.</p>
      <p>He admitted causing damage to the house and a car that was parked outside in Dean Crescent on September 28.</p>
      <p>Shanks also admitted illegal possession of a knife. He was on bail at the time of the offences.</p>
      <p>The court heard Sharon McAslan and Charmaine Fields were in the living room when Shanks and another man launched their attack on the property.</p>
      <p>When the women went outside to the confront them, the men ran away and Shanks was seen to throw a kitchen knife into a garden.</p>
      <p>Defence agent Jackson Bateman said his client went to the house after an incident involving his sister.</p>
      <p>A man and two women had gone to her mother’s house, where she was living, and caused a scene.</p>
      <p>Mr Bateman told the court: “William Shanks was not thinking clearly due to the emotional state of his sister.</p>
      <p>“Thankfully, no one was injured when he went to this house, but it was upsetting for the persons concerned.”</p>
      <p>Sheriff Thomas Millar noted that Shanks has a “lengthy” record and jailed him for 11 months, to start next month when another sentence he is serving ends.</p>
