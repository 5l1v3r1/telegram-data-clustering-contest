      <p>MELBOURNE: It's still a good two years away but Australia coach <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Justin-Langer">Justin Langer</a> says he has started building the battle-hardened and mature squad that would be able to challenge the formidable-at-home India in the 2022 Test series.</p>
      <p>Langer, who took over as Australia coach in May 2018 soon after the ball-tampering episode in South Africa, has closely observed India dominating at home in the longest format with a goal in mind -- to have a squad mature enough to combat the world no.1 Test team.</p>
      <p>Kohli's men registered a record-breaking 11th home series win on the trot when they defeated South Africa last month at home.</p>
      <p>"It reminds me of how hard it is, that's for sure," Langer told ESPNcricinfo.</p>
      <p>"It's always been the case that it's been hard to win in India. But that's the expectation and we've got a couple of years now to find that maturity. I'm talking about, to be nice and battle hardened and as ready as possible for that series," he said.</p>
      <p>The 2022 series between the arch-rivals will be held between September and November and will include four Tests and three T20 Internationals as per the current Future Tours Program.</p>
      <p>Langer had spoken about the ultimate goal of defeating India in India when he was appointed as Australia coach.</p>
      <p>"If I fast forward it, the Indian tour against India, the Test tour in three or four years' time, to me that's the ultimate. We will judge ourselves as a great cricket team if we beat India in India," he had said.</p>
      <p>Since the 48-year-old has taken over, Australia has had an inconsistent run. They lost a home series to India before defeating Sri Lanka but just about managed to retain the Ashes after drawing the engagement in England earlier this year.</p>
      <p>"I think it was an indication of the maturity of our team. I don't mean maturity in age but coming together as a group, it takes great skill but it takes time, great mental toughness and endurance, to be able to back it up over and over again," he said.</p>
      <p>"When you're going through it you'd love to see more of that consistency, but I look at it from a bigger picture point of view, it means we've got areas we can keep getting better in."</p>
