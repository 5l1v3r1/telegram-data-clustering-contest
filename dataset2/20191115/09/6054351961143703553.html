      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T09:02:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 09:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://hiphopdx.com/author/brian.alvarado" target="_blank">Brian Alvarado</a></address>
      <p>Los Angeles – <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.49916/title.alicia-keys-will-host-2019-grammy-awards">Alicia Keys</a> will be brought back for a second consecutive year to host the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards in 2020.</p>
      <p>Last year, the iconic singer became the first woman to host the show since Queen Latifah in 2005 according to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/14/entertainment/alicia-keys-grammy-awards-2020/index.html">CNN</a>.</p>
      <p>Keys, a 15-time Grammy Award-winning artist herself, said that the decision to come back was an easy one.</p>
      <p>“At first I did think last year was a one-time thing but when the opportunity came back around there was no question about returning as host of the Grammy Awards,” Keys said in a <a href="https://www.grammy.com/press-releases/fifteen-time-grammy%C2%AE-winner-alicia-keys-returns-host-62nd-annual-grammy-awards%C2%AE">press release</a>. “Last year was such a powerful experience for me. Not only did I feel the love in the room, but I felt it from around the world and it confirmed the healing and unifying the power of music.”</p>

      <p>On Wednesday, the “If I Ain’t Got You” singer took to YouTube for a playful twist to her announcement in which she’s having a conversation with the 2019 version of herself about hosting the show once again.</p>
      <p>“How are you going to start the show,” asked the 2019 version of Keys. “You know what, you need, a horse!”</p>
      <p>The 2020 installment of the Grammys will take place on January 26 at the Staples Center.</p>
