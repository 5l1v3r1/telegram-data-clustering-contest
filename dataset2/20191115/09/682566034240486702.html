      <p>Cape Town - England World Cup winner <b>James Vince</b> has joined the <b>Paarl Rocks </b>in time for their second <b>Mzansi Super League (MSL)</b> game on Friday against the <b>Durban Heat</b>.</p>
      <p>Vince arrived on Thursday after England’s dramatic victory over New Zealand in Auckland over the weekend in their T20 series. </p>
      <p>During the series Vince made his maiden T20I fifty and will hope to emulate that form in his first appearance in the MSL. </p>
      <p>The Paarl-based side started the MSL with an emphatic win against local rivals Cape Town Blitz on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The Paarl Rocks’ next game is against the Heat on Friday before they return home for their third game against Tshwane Spartans on Sunday at Boland Park.</p>
      <p>Vince, who played three games at the 50-over World Cup while regular opener Jason Roy was sidelined with a hamstring injury, hit 59 in England's series-opening, seven-wicket win against the Black Caps in Christchurch at the beginning of the month.</p>
      <p>Captain Faf du Plessis said after Sunday’s win against the Blitz the Paarl Rocks were a batsman short in the balance of the team. </p>
      <p>"We are a bit challenged with two batsmen (Markram, Duminy) being injured, but Vince is back for the next game which will help to sort things out," he said.  </p>
      <p>Vince and Sri Lankan, Isuru Udana, are the Paarl Rocks’ two international players for the 2019 MSL. </p>
