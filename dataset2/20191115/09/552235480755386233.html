      <p>The upset couple this week told the Advertiser that some of the items stolen were sentimental to them and were irreplaceable.</p>
      <p>They said: “We’ve had many pieces of jewellery stolen from our home.</p>

      <p>“ Many had sentimental value and it was a horrible experience. We would urge anyone who has any information to contact the police, anonymously or otherwise.”</p>
      <p>Among the items taken was a gold Omega ladies’ watch. It was in a red leather box and had a round face.</p>
      <p>A gold three-diamond twist setting ring was also taken from the home.</p>
      <p>Inspector Derek Hamilton said: “Police Scotland are requesting any member of the public who have information about any individuals’ involvement.</p>
      <p>“Or if they have been approached by individuals trying to sell this jewellery could they please get in contact with us via 101 or Crimestoppers.</p>
      <p>“The items stolen were not only valuable in monetary terms, but were of great sentimental value to the couple and we are doing everything we can to find their property for them.”</p>
