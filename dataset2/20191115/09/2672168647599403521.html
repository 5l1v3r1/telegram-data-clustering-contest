      <p>Yangon residents were faced with strong winds, heavy rain and thunder on November 14 due to the clouds remained from a storm and nimbus.</p>
      <p>“Yangon and Ayeyawady regions have some rain as whirlwind is crossing southern areas of Myanmar. A low pressure area may form in west of Bay of Bengal around November 16 but we cannot tell for sure as it is not strong. In recent days, rain poured down and the weather was cold,” said Dr Kyaw Moe Oo, Director General of the Department of Meteorology and Hydrology (DMH).</p>
      <p>Windy conditions are not stable in a time where weather is changing from summer to winter season. Wind from the sea is still warm and people need to be careful of instability in the wind, said Meteorologist Chit Kyaw.</p>
      <p>“Strong wind from the east crossed Mon and Taninthayi coasts on November 14 and it carried water vapour making rain in Mon, Taninthayi, Yangon and Ayeyawady. There will be less rain clouds within two days time as wind from northwest pushed back the wind from the east,” he said.</p>
      <p>Rain or thundershowers will be widespread in Yangon Region, fairly widespread in Ayeyawady and Taninthayi regions, scattered in Bago Region and isolated in Kayah, Kayin and Mon states. Night time temperatures are about two degree centigrade above average temperature of November in Mandalay and Magway regions and Shan (South), Rakhine, Kayin and Mon states. Night time temperatures are about three degree centigrade above average temperature of November in Bago Region and Kachin State. The remaining states and regions have an average temperature of November. Recorded night time temperatures are nine degree centigrade in Hakha and ten degree centigrade each in Mindat, Tiddim and Ramkalong. Recorded rainfalls are 1.89 inches in Yay, 1.21 inches in Dawei, 1.08 inches in Nyaungdone, 1.02 inches each in Kayan and Kungyangon, 0.71 inch in Yangon (downtown), 0.59 inches each in Hlegu and Pyapon and 0.48 inches each in Yangon (Kabaraye) and Maubin.</p>
