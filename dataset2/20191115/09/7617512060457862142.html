      <h1>B.C. Transit cancels one trip in Greater Victoria on Friday morning</h1>

      <p>B.C. Transit cancelled just one bus trip due to bus availability on Friday morning.</p>
      <p>The following trips will not operate due to bus availability:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>16 Uptown/UVic leaving Carey at Ravine at 8:03 a.m.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Another trip on the 15 Esquimalt/UVic route was reinstated after being cancelled.</p>
      <p>The transit system was plagued with cancellations in September and October as mechanics struggled to keep Victoria’s aging fleet on the road.</p>
      <p>Last week, B.C. Transit borrowed seven buses from Abbotsford and Kelowna in an attempt to prevent trip cancellations on Greater Victoria routes. Four the two-year-old buses came from Abbotsford, three from Kelowna.</p>
      <p>B.C. Transit is still delivering more than 99 per cent of its scheduled services every day, which includes 3,200 trips on weekdays, said spokesman Jonathon Dyck.</p>
      <p>Last week, B.C. Transit said it was operating with the number of buses it needs. There are 302 buses in the fleet, based in Victoria and Langford.</p>
      <p>B.C. Transit’s Victoria operation saw an almost 10 per cent increase in ridership in September, year-over-year. Ridership on the No. 50 bus from the West Shore to downtown Victoria has jumped 44 per cent in five years.</p>
      <p>In 2020 there will be 80 new buses, which will reduce the average fleet age from 12 years to six years. A significant percentage of the new buses will operate on compressed natural gas. Ten electric buses are scheduled to arrive in 2021.</p>
      <p>The borrowed buses from Abbotsford and Kelowna will be returned when Victoria’s new buses arrive.</p>
