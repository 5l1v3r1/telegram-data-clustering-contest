      <p>Uber on Thursday announced the launch of a new security feature called RideCheck in South Africa, which will detect “anomalies” during trips.</p>
      <p>According to the company, RideCheck will automatically detect things like unusually long stops and “proactively surfaces tools riders and drivers may need to get help”.</p>
      <p>“When a RideCheck is initiated, both a rider and driver will receive a notification asking if everything is OK,” Uber explained in a press release.</p>
      <p>Once alerted, drivers and riders can then access tools such as the emergency button or trusted contacts for help.</p>
      <p>“This technology will continue to evolve, and we are working to add additional scenarios to RideCheck,” Uber also noted.</p>
      <p>The feature is currently rolling out to all South African users.</p>
