      <p>Lenovo owned brand -Motorola earlier on Thursday <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/14/the-foldable-motorola-razr-with-6-2-inch-oled-219-cinemavision-display-is-official/">unveiled</a> the Foldable Motorola Razr – a foldable form factor of the very iconic  <i>Motorola Razr that was a household name in the mid-00s. The device is Motorola’s first modern foldable smartphone, and its response to the Galaxy Fold and the Huawei Mate X released earlier this year.</i></p>
      <p>Unlike the Fold and the Mate X, the new Razr folds and unfolds like the classic flip phones and even retains the look of the classic Razr from the 2000s. The Razr’s design looks more practical, as it remains compact, lightweight, and very pocketable when folded. You can hit this page <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/14/the-foldable-motorola-razr-with-6-2-inch-oled-219-cinemavision-display-is-official/">for more on the Razr phone specs, and design</a>.</p>
      <p>So far, Motorola has only confirmed that the Foldable Motorola Razr will go on sale in the US in early January for $1,500. It is exclusive to Verizon and is will be available for pre-order from De. 26. Select Walmart stores will also stock the device, though we are not certain when that will be available on shelves.</p>
      <p>It will also be hitting the stores in Canada in early 2020 at an unknown date. Motorola has yet to detail the Razr phone available outside of the region. However, we now have confirmation the device will launch in India, but not in China. While there is no definite release date yet, the firm has begun taking registrations on its India <a href="https://www.motorola.in/email-register/crm-campaigns/registration-razr">website as well</a>. Official price and a concrete India launch date will, perhaps, surface in the coming weeks.</p>
      <p>For the China launch, the Lenovo President, Liu Jun, earlier today confirmed that the Motorola Razr clamshell foldable smartphone isn’t coming to China soon as domestic operators do not support eSIM.</p>
