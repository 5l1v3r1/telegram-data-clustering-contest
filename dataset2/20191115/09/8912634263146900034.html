      <p>PHNOM PENH: Cambodia will ban all elephant rides at the country’s famed Angkor temple park by early next year, an official said Friday, a rare win for conservationists who have long decried the popular practice as cruel.<br/>The Angkor archaeological complex in northern Siem Reap attracts the bulk of the kingdom’s foreign tourists — which topped six million in 2018 — and many opt for elephants rides around the ancient temples.<br/>But these rides “will end by the start of 2020,” said Long Kosal, a spokesman with the Apsara Authority, which manages the park.<br/>“Using elephants for business is not appropriate anymore,” he told AFP, adding that some of the animals were “already old.”<br/>So far, five of the 14 working elephants have been transferred to a community forest about 40 kilometers (25 miles) away from the temples.<br/>“They will live out their natural lives there,” Kosal said.<br/>The company that owns the elephants will continue to look after them, he added.<br/>Cambodia has long come under fire from animal rights groups for ubiquitous elephant rides on offer for tourists, also seen in neighboring Thailand, Vietnam and Laos.<br/>The elephants are broken in during training and rights groups have accused handlers of overworking them.<br/>In 2016, a female elephant died by the roadside after carrying tourists around the Angkor Wat temple complex in severely hot weather.<br/>The animal had been working for around 45 minutes before she collapsed.</p>
