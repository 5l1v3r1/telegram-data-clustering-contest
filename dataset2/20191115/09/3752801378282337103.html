      <p>The latest development came after a group of refugees scaled the UNHCR fence on Thursday to escape eviction, following a court order on Wednesday which gave them three days to vacate the area around the building.</p>
      <p>A trespassing charge was opened, which the police acted executed on Friday morning.</p>

      <p>On Thursday, the Sheriff of the High Court read out the order granted by the Gauteng High Court in Pretoria and pinned it to the gates.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of refugees are asking to be resettled in another country, as they fear xenophobic attacks in South Africa.</p>
      <p>They have been living on the pavements, in tents and makeshift structures, outside the UNHCR offices since the beginning of October.</p>
      <p>Their presence led to an urgent application by the Waterkloof Homeowners' Association and Brooklyn and Eastern Areas Citizens' Association, which was granted.</p>
