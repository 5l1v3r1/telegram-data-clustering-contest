      <p>Questions over on the future of night-time parking charges have been raised.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the Cabinet approved plans to revoke a £1 overnight fee in all car parks apart from the multi-story and Phoenix House, but then subsequently reversed that decision. Speaking in September, Leader of the Council, Councillor Bob Deed (Cadbury, Independent) said the revised decision needed to be made, as the Council had a deficit of up to £500,000 to reduce. Free overnight parking would have reduced parking income by £28,000 per year.</p>
      <p>At a meeting on Wednesday, November 6, Councillor Clive Eginton (Taw Vale, Conservative) asked: “Following the cabinet U-turn and the acceptance of the working group, Economy Policy Development Group and Scrutiny’s recommendations on night-time charging, I was somewhat surprised to see a post on the Mid Devon Lib Dem’s Facebook page on October 8 relating to this matter.</p>
      <p>“While trying to justify the U-turn on the Lib Dem pre-election pledge of free night-time parking, they say and I quote, ‘we are hoping the decision to charge at night will be reviewed in the future’.</p>
      <p>“Therefore, can I ask Councillor White as the portfolio holder when exactly in the future do you propose and review and when do you believe that this Council’s income from night-time charging can be extinguished with yet another U-turn?”</p>

      <p>Councillor Alex White (Upper Yeo, Liberal Democrats), the Cabinet Member for Finance responded saying they had listened to concerns of their colleagues.</p>
      <p> “Being an open and transparent administration as has already been highlighted, we listened to the concerns of our colleagues,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It went through several different stages by a mixture of different parties. It went through different working groups, and the recommendation was to change our decision. Having thought very hard and carefully about it, we decided to do that as our colleagues were telling us and change our minds. We did so.</p>
      <p>“I’m sure Cllr Eginton is aware - having been the leader of this Council previously - is that car parking charges are reviewed periodically. It’s normally on a three-yearly basis, and so there will be another review at some point in the future, that is correct to say.”</p>
