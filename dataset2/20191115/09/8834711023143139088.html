      <p>SAA’S acting CFO Deon Fredricks said that management had bent over backwards to make a deal with striking unions but they won’t budge.</p>
      <p>Unions including Numsa, the SA Cabin Crew Association (Sacca) and Satawu were angry over restructuring plans which could see more than 900 retrenchments.</p>
      <p>They’d also rejected the airline’s 5.9% pay increase offer, demanding 8%.</p>
      <p>Fredricks said that all attempts to resolve the impasse had failed.</p>
      <p>“We’d given them a new offer that we will pay them six months back pay in April, the balance in October. We will then also increase their salaries by 5% in April. Yesterday, we improved that offer, that we will pay them in March and we will go and look for funding to go and pay for that.”</p>
