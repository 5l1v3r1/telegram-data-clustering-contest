        <b>Kurt Zouma says <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/tag/olivier-giroud">Olivier Giroud</a> is “frustrated” at Chelsea, but is still offering advice to his rival strikers.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 33-year-old started for France and scored the winner against Moldova on Thursday night, but his chances for Chelsea have been limited.</p>
      <p>The forward has only made one start in the Premier League under Frank Lampard, and that was back in August, with Lampard opting to use Tammy Abraham as his number nine.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/chelsea-star-breaks-silence-on-frustration-at-lack-of-gametime"><b>And while Giroud is obviously far from happy about his situation,</b> </a>especially with Euro 2020 on the horizon, he has still been doing his bit to help 22-year-old Abraham and Michy Batshuayi.</p>
      <p>“He is frustrated, he wants to play more,” Zouma said. “Like any football player, he wants to be on the pitch, but he is taking everything very calmly.</p>
      <p>“He is a professional, he works hard in training.</p>
      <p>“I have a lot of respect for the player he is. As someone in the dressing room, he is someone who gives advice to Tammy and Michy.</p>
      <p>“He wants the best for the team, which is important, and it is why he is a good person.”</p>
      <p>Lampard confirmed earlier this month that he had no complaints about any of his forwards.</p>
      <p>“It is difficult for me and it is difficult for them – we both have our jobs so it doesn’t feature in my thinking. I have care for all the players. I have to pick the squad as I see it for the best of Chelsea as they do for their countries,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I have got three strikers to pick from and I have to make the choices. Again I can’t complain about any of their attitudes.”</p>
      <p>Giroud has been linked with Inter Milan, but reports via the Daily Mirro have now claimed that Borussia Dortmund have entered the race for Giroud, who could contemplate a move away in January if he continues to kick his heels on the bench.</p>
