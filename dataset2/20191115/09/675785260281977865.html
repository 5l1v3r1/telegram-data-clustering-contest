      <p>A devastated boyfriend was planning a romantic Valentine's Day <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/proposals">proposal</a> before his 24-year-old girlfriend was found dead.</p>
      <p>Devoted partner of two-and-a-half years Drew McLean said he and partner Charlotte Orwin had booked to go to Rome - where he was planning on asking her to marry him.</p>
      <p>But less than a week later, in June this year, Charlotte tragically died of adult death syndrome.</p>
      <p>Charlotte, of Brunswick Village, Newcastle, had lived a good lifestyle and friends and family knew her as a happy and healthy young woman who looked after herself.</p>
      <p>Her death came as a huge shock to loved ones, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/charlotte-orwin-newcastle-university-death-17255234">Chronicle Live reports.</a></p>

      <p>Heartbroken Drew said: "Charlotte was my missing puzzle piece. She was amazing and she changed my life completely - she completed me. ”</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old added: “She lived the perfect life and looked after herself. She didn’t drink or smoke, yet she has been taken from us - it doesn’t feel fair.”</p>
      <p>The Newcastle University graduate spent her final day celebrating Drew’s mum’s birthday in Newcastle.</p>

      <p>But the next morning she failed to arrive at work and it was later discovered that she had died between Drew getting up for work at 5.45am and her alarm going off at 6am.</p>
      <p>Drew said he became concerned about Charlotte when he hadn’t heard from her that morning.</p>
      <p>He told: “I rang one of Charlotte’s colleagues to find out if she was at work, but when I was told she wasn’t there I began to panic.</p>
      <p>“When I pulled up outside the house her car was still there and the curtains had not been opened. It was at that moment I just knew she had died.”</p>

      <p>To help the memory of Charlotte live on, Drew has been campaigning to raise awareness of CRY (Cardiac Risk in the Young), the charity that has supported him since her death.</p>
      <p>He also took part in a CRY Memorial Walk in Durham with Charlotte’s mum last month.</p>
      <p>Drew added: “I remember someone at the walk had said a lot of these deaths you won’t have read about in the paper.</p>
      <p>“That was like a light bulb moment for me and I knew  I had to do something about it.”</p>
      <p>According to CRY, one in 300 people aged between 14 and 35 will have a potentially serious heart condition and 12 young people die from undiagnosed heart conditions each week.</p>
      <p>It costs £5,000 to deliver cardiac screening to 100 people, but the results can be lifesaving.</p>

      <p>Drew will participate in the London Landmarks Half Marathon to raise money for the charity next year and donations can be made  <a href="https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?userUrl=DrewMclean1&amp;pageUrl=1">here</a> .</p>
