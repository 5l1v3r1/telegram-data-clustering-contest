      <h1>Meditation spaces inform minimalist interior of Valencia's Swiss Concept clinic</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T09:00:01+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.dezeen.com/author/ali-morris/" target="_blank">Ali Morris</a></address>
      <p>Ash-wood surfaces, translucent glass screens and brass feature inside this serene clinic in <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/valencia/">Valencia</a>, which <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/francesc-rife-studio/">Francesc Rifé Studio</a> has designed in reference to Asian meditation rooms.</p>
      <p>The facial and dental clinic, named <a href="https://www.clinicaswissconcept.es/">Swiss Concept</a>, has been designed by Barcelona-based <a href="http://www.rife-design.com/">Francesc Rifé Studio</a> to feature colours and materials that are typically applied throughout meditation spaces in Asian countries like Japan.</p>

      <p>"Mainly inspired by eastern aesthetics and meditation, this clinic was conceived following notions of lightness and calm – a deep approach which has been achieved through very simple means," said Francesc Rifé, the studio's eponymous founder.</p>
      <p>"This project demonstrates our ongoing focus on achieving the most with the least."</p>

      <p>Clients arriving at the clinic are greeted at a softly lit, ash-panelled reception desk that's backed by a wall painted sage green.</p>
      <p>Adjacently runs a white walkway lined with panels of backlit frosted glass. The glowing glass-panels conceal the treatment rooms that sit at the core of the clinic, blurring the figures of doctors and patients behind.</p>

      <p>Each treatment area has two doors – one at the front of the room and another at the rear. This design facilitates a circular route around the clinic's floor plan, creating a continuous flow of doctors and patients.</p>

      <p>The waiting area has been integrated into the clinic's rear corridor, where a series of timber-framed windows are covered with translucent screens to soften daylight streaming through from the outdoors.</p>

      <p>Deep window sills double up as bench seats, which face onto the treatment rooms.</p>

      <p>A laboratory, sterilisation room, bathrooms and consultation area are set around the perimeter of the clinic, distinguished from the rest of the space by their all-white fit-out.</p>
      <p>Strips of sulphurised brass have been used to line the edges of bookshelves and to craft slim door-handles, designed by the studio specifically for this project. Minimalist lanterns also emit a warm glow throughout the rooms.</p>

      <p>Francesc Rifé Studio isn't the only practice to create a pared-back health space – By Seog Be Seog <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2019/10/15/aeichi-korean-medical-clinic-by-by-seog-be-seog/">stripped all superfluous decoration from a clinic in Seoul</a> to form an open, inviting space where patients felt relaxed enough to discuss their health problems.</p>
