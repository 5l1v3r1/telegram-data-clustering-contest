      <p>Acclaimed global artist, Njideka Akunyili-Crosby, has been profiled in the 2019 Time Magazine ‘100 Next’ list.</p>
      <p>Time’s ‘100 Next’ is an annual list of 100 influential people in the world who are actively contributing to changing the world through their craft.</p>
      <p><i>News Agency of Nigeria</i> reports that Akunyili-Crosby is the daughter of late Dora Akunyili, who was a former Director-General of the National Agency for Food Administration and Control; and also a former Minister of Information and Communications from 2008 to 2010.</p>
      <p>In a blurb describing the artist, journalist Madeleine Carlisle wrote, “Njideka Akunyili-Crosby’s works have sold for millions at auctions.</p>

      <p>“But in 2018, it was possible to see one at Los Angeles’ Museum of Contemporary Art free of charge — you didn’t even have to go inside.</p>
      <p>“The visual artist was only the second person to be chosen to create a mural on the walls of the museum itself, which was visible from Grand Avenue’s sidewalk.</p>
      <p>“It featured brightly coloured scenes of domestic life: in one section, a woman rests her elbow on a table, seemingly deep in thought.</p>
      <p>“Akunyili-Crosby — who moved to the U.S. from Nigeria in her teens— is known for such scenes, some of which are autobiographical and incorporate references to both countries,” Carlisle wrote.</p>
      <p>In her words, Akunyili-Crosby told TIME, “I’m really looking at how [Nigeria and the U.S.] are complex hybrid spaces.”</p>
      <p>NAN reports that in 2018, she made history after selling a painting of hers for the sum of N1.2bn.</p>
      <p>She recently won a $625,000 MacArthur Genius Grant which set her N225m richer.</p>
      <p>Her iconic <i>Bush Babies</i> painting was sold by Sotheby’s for N1.2bn.</p>
