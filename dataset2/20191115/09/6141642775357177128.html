      <p>Boris Johnson has defended his controversial method of making a cup of tea as “delicious” during an interview on BBC Breakfast.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Naga Munchetty during an extended interview on Friday’s edition of the programme, the PM discussed the NHS, Brexit and the flooding affecting the country.</p>
      <p>Towards the end of the interview, Munchetty said she wanted the audience to “get a feel” for Mr Johnson.</p>
      <p>She raised a recent video showing the PM putting milk on top of a teabag and keeping the bag in rather than removing it after it had stewed.</p>

      <p>In the clip posted by the Conservative Party on Twitter on November 12, Mr Johnson was seen making a cup of tea while being asked about his favourite bands.</p>
      <p>Making the beverage, he added a teabag to a mug, filled it with boiling water from a tap before adding milk and failing to remove the teabag at any point.</p>
      <p>During Friday’s interview, the PM defended his tea-making habits as Munchetty said it would lead to “stewed tea”.</p>
      <p>“What’s wrong with that, by the way?” Mr Johnson asked. “Why does everybody object to that? You wouldn’t do that?</p>
      <p>“And by the way, why does everybody object to leaving the teabag in? It’s delicious, if you want to keep drinking a cup of tea, it’s better.”</p>
      <p>The video prompted a significant amount of debate both for his decision to put the milk in with the teabag still in the mug, as well as for leaving the bag in.</p>
      <p>The four-and-a-half-minute clip received thousands of interactions on social media, prompting many memes and responses in addition to the passionate debate.</p>
