      <h1>Confusion reigns as man in Celtic shirt goes on Rangers stadium tour</h1>
      <h2>The bizarre situation has come to light after photos appeared online.</h2>

      <p>A mystery man has caused a social media buzz by visiting Ibrox to attend a tour of the famous old ground - in the Hoops of bitter rivals <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> !</p>
      <p>The individual was pictured filming outside the Govan stadium in a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> top adorned with the name of skillful midfielder <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/callum-mcgregor">Callum McGregor</a>.</p>
      <p>He was well equipped with a tripod and microphone to record his visit.</p>
      <p>Later, he was also pictured in the Ibrox press room where <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a> give post-match press-briefings and in the iconic Blue Room where major announcements, like the appointment of new managers, are often made.</p>

      <p>It is unclear whether the man is a slightly befuddled tourist, the subject of a colossal wind-up or part of some sort of bizarre video experiment.</p>
      <p>With the preponderance of football bloggers now pumping out content on the likes of YouTube, he may simply be looking to report on the city's two biggest clubs.</p>

      <p>Either way it appears the mystery man was welcomed warmly at Ibrox despite his unusual sartorial choice.</p>
