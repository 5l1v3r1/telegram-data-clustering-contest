      <p>CALGARY â€“ As Calgary Flames defenceman TJ Brodie recovers at home following a harrowing incident on the ice, team brass provided an update Friday morning on his condition.</p>
      <p>About 15 minutes into Thursday's practice at the Scotiabank Saddledome, Brodie collapsed to the ice and began to convulse.</p>
      <p>"Our medical team immediately sprung into action," said Flames GM Brad Treliving. "I can't thank the work of the medical team enough. You saw the best in the business in action, live and in colour there."</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old was on the ice for nearly 15 minutes while the team's medical staff and emergency crews attended to him. Brodie was responsive while being transported off the ice on a stretcher and was taken to the Foothills Medical Centre where he underwent testing. Late Thursday, the Flames confirmed Brodie had been released from hospital and was recovering at home with his family.</p>
      <p>"He's doing well. There's parts of it that he doesn't remember," said Treliving. "He's sore but he's doing well.</p>
      <p>"All of the tests that have come back to date have been negative."</p>
      <p>Dr. Ian Auld, head team physician with the Calgary Flames, says an event like the one Brodie experienced could be caused by "something in the brain, something scary," but the event was "more than likely a fainting episode."</p>
      <p>"He's going to see a neurology team," said Auld. "We have some specialists lined up. I don't think we have all the answers yet."</p>
      <p>Treliving confirmed Brodie will not be joining the team on the weekend trip for games against the Arizona Coyotes and Vegas Golden Knights.</p>
