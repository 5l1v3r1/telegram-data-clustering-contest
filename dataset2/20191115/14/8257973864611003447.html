      <p>Nov. 15 (UPI) -- <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Jeff_Goldblum/?tps=1">Jeff Goldblum</a> said on <i><a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Jimmy_Kimmel/?tps=1">Jimmy Kimmel</a> Live</i> that his new <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Disney/?tps=1">Disney</a>+ series <i>The World According to Jeff Goldblum</i> is an experience.</p>
      <p>"I don't think it's a travel show really," <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfMRW83m55E">the actor said</a> on Thursday.</p>
      <p>"It's an experience for me, they sent me everywhere around the United States, if we do more --which I hope we do -- maybe we'll go outside internationally, but here we went to all kinds of places that I never would have gone otherwise and I had experiences," he continued.</p>
      <p><i>The World According to Jeff Goldblum</i> follows the <i>Jurassic Park</i> star as he uncovers new science, history and insights into <a href="https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2019/10/21/New-original-series-films-coming-to-Disney/1231571522576/">familiar objects</a>.</p>
      <p>Some of Goldblum's favorite experiences from the show included going to a water park and riding a water slide for the first time and getting a gold grill for his mouth.</p>
      <p>"They put me in a big kind of tub you know, going down this harrowing thing, I thought we were going to fall out," he said of his trip to the water park. "I thought my life was ending."</p>
      <p>Goldblum recently released a new album titled <i>I Shouldn't be Telling You This </i>which features appearances by Fiona Apple and <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Miley_Cyrus/?tps=1">Miley Cyrus</a>, among others.</p>
      <p>The 67-year-old also described how he once got to play piano alongside Aerosmith during a stadium concert. He said he wasn't ready for the moment when frontman <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Steven_Tyler/?tps=1">Steven Tyler</a> invited him onstage but that he performed anyway.</p>
      <p>"I got some chords, was able to play along and it was great," he said.</p>
