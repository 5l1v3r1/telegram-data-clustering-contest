      <h1>Chance to grab a winter coat for free in Perth</h1>
      <h2>Kind pair set up pop-up event so no one goes cold</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T14:16:46+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 14:16</time> by <a rel="author">Rachel Clark, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/rachel-clark/</a></address>
      <p>Perth residents who are facing spending a cold winter with no proper jacket to wear will be able to pick up one for free this weekend.</p>
      <p>A pop-up event will be held on Sunday, November 17 in North Muirton Community Centre, where winter clothes including jackets, scarves and boots will be given out to those in need.</p>
      <p>Friends Cheryl Fleming and Leanne Kelly-Conlon have been busy collecting bags full of donations, and are hoping all those who would otherwise go without will come along on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Cheryl explained: “My friend and I decided there are too many people who are cold at this time of year, particularly people who are on benefits.</p>
      <p>“Coats, boots and scarves are the most expensive things to buy.</p>
      <p>“There is so much poverty with people having to use food banks, and I see a lot of people going about and they haven’t got a proper winter coat on.</p>
      <p>“It makes me feel really bad.</p>
      <p>“So we put out the word for people to give us their old coats for all ages of kids and men’s and women’s, and they will be put out at a pop-up event this Sunday in the North Muirton Community Centre.</p>
      <p>“Everyone who comes on Sunday will be given a ticket and they will be allowed to take one of each item for every member of their family.</p>
      <p>“They can take it for free, and be all cosy this winter.</p>

      <p>“I know charity shops sell coats but sometimes they cost about £10.”</p>
      <p>Cheryl is hoping as many people as possible come along to the pop-up on Sunday, which will be open from 10am until 2pm.</p>
      <p>She continued: “I hope people will not be too proud to come in.</p>
      <p>“I have had times where I have not been as able.</p>
      <p>“When it was just me and my little boy I had to buy coats off eBay, but I am in a better position now.</p>
      <p>“I got in touch with the food bank and they are going to tell everyone who comes in about it, and we have given leaflets to all the schools, particularly those in deprived areas, so teachers can also hand them out.</p>
      <p>“We have also put out leaflets in the local shop and in the CATH (Churches Action for The Homeless) centre.</p>
      <p>“We have had so many donations, we have about 30 giant bin bags full and there is still more coming in.</p>
      <p>“I have been so surprised at how generous people have been.</p>
      <p>“Some of the stuff we have been given is immaculate, and some of it has never been worn.</p>
      <p>“One woman gave us a bag of knitted teddies for the kids as well.</p>
      <p>“Everyone has really pulled together for it, and I really want a lot of people to come.”</p>
      <p>The event will run in North Muirton Community Centre from 10am until 2pm on Sunday, November 17.</p>
      <p>Donations can also be handed in to the community centre on Sunday.</p>
