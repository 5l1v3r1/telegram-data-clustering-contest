      <p>Social media influencer and businesswoman Pokello Nare has clapped back at a netizen who questioned her intentions after <a href="https://iharare.com/pokello-thrills-the-warriors/">she popped up at the Warriors camp and took pictures with some of the players.</a></p>
      <p>Said one Tweep</p>
      <aside>Pokello or anyone else with no business with the national team must keep away from the Warriors camp! Simple football business no drama.</aside>
      <p>Pokello revealed that she wasn’t doing it for love and likes but she was in the camp on account of her teenage son Nathan who is an esteemed football player.</p>
      <aside> I was there on Football business. And I have authorization to be there for as long as my son is a member of a Zim soccer national team. Now Save that for your Records!<br/>Your stupidity is untreatable. If my son has the same agent with some of them then of course we have unlimited interaction with them. You chose pictures that would sell your narrative and not the real reason we were there. Stupid!” fumed Pokello</aside>
      <p>Talk about stirring the hornet’s nest…</p>
