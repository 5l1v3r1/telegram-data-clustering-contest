      <p>WAILUKU, Hawaii (AP) - The Hawaii Department of Health has notified a Maui neighborhood of a suspected case of a mosquito-borne illness near their residences.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.mauinews.com/">The Maui News </a>reported Thursday that the case involves a resident with a suspected illness acquired while traveling internationally.</p>
      <p>Spokeswoman Janice Okubo says in an email that the health department expects test results within days.</p>
      <p>The department issued about 80 letters to residents in a Kahului neighborhood after officials were notified of the case within 200 yards (183 meters) of their homes.</p>
      <p>Okubo would not provide the exact streets involved to protect the patient’s identity.</p>
      <p>Okubo says the Nov. 8 letters are part of the department’s protocol and preventative action.</p>
      <p>The notice asks residents to eliminate standing water around their homes and try to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes.</p>
