      <h2>Man Utd will have to look elsewhere for a director of football after Edwin van der Sar committed his future to Ajax</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T14:11:03+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 14:11</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Former Manchester United goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar has ended speculation he could return to Old Trafford by inking a new deal with Ajax.</p>
      <p>The Dutchman won four Premier League titles and the Champions League during his six-year stint as a United player.</p>
      <p>He was tipped to head back to the club as director of football having overseen Ajax's return to European prominence in recent years.</p>
      <p>But he has now been tied down to a four-year deal keeping him in Amsterdam until 2023 leaving the Red Devils faced with having to look elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Van der Sar wrote on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> : “Very happy with my contract extension at this beautiful club! I started as a goalie in 1991, three years ago I became Ajax CEO.</p>

      <p>“We’ve had some difficult moments, but the good times are definitely back. And of course we want more in the future!”</p>
      <p>Van der Sar previously revealed he would only contemplate returning to Old Trafford if he was made chief executive rather than director of football.</p>
      <p>Opening up about his future, he said: “I am a chief executive - and that is a very different role to director of football.</p>
      <p>“Besides my wife and children I have two loves in my life. They are Ajax and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> .</p>

      <p>“Ajax scouted me, gave me the chance to become their No 1 goalkeeper.</p>
      <p>“Manchester United gave me the chance to make even bigger steps and develop at an even higher level.</p>
      <p>“So of course I am interested in a position at United.</p>

      <p>“But I think I need to learn a little bit more about myself as a chief executive at Ajax and develop myself even further.</p>
      <p>“United is a fantastic club. So let’s see what the future brings.”</p>
      <p>A host of names have been linked as Ed Woodward looks to bring in a new member of staff to oversee playing matters.</p>
