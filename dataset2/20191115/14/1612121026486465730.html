      <p>Having previously gone on sale in Russia and the Netherlands, the <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/345635-honor-9x/">Honor 9X</a> is finally available to purchase in the United Kingdom. For £249 you’ll get a handset with a notch-less display, a trio of rear cameras, all-day battery life, and a pop-up selfie camera.</p>
      <p>The 9X features a big 6.59-inch IPS FullView notch-less display with FHD+ resolution, the afore-mentioned Kirin 710 octa-core processor, and depending on region, 4GB/6GB of RAM and 64GB/128GB of built-in storage with MicroSD card support of up to 512GB. Honor addressed one of our main concerns with the 2018’s <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/reviews/phone/honor-8x/">8X</a> by giving the 9X a USB Type-C charging port, which is appreciated, and, amazingly at this point in 2019, an audio jack is present. Powering the 9X is a big 4,000mAh battery that should bring all-day battery life and a little more besides.</p>
      <p>The trio of rear cameras consists of a 48MP main sensor, an 8MP Super-wide angle lens, and a 2MP Depth-of-Field sensor. The pop-up selfie camera features a 16MP sensor.</p>
      <p>Available in Midnight Black and Sapphire Blue, the Honor 9X is available from the usual suspects such as Amazon and Carphone Warehouse. Keep an eye out for our upcoming review of the Honor 9X.</p>
