      </p>
      <p><b>The recent downward trend</b> in the imports of Petrol could be attributed to the closure of Nigeria’s land borders on August 22 by the Federal Government, in order to check smuggling activities of banned goods into the country.</p>
      <p><b>The state-owned oil firm</b> had reportedly said recently before the land border closure that petrol was being smuggled out of the country to Ghana, Burkina Faso, Mali and Cote d’Ivoire as a result of the price discrepancy between Nigeria and its neighbouring West African countries.</p>
      <p><b>Meanwhile</b>, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) had disclosed earlier that the recent closure of the borders might have contributed to the large reduction in PMS leaving from fuel yards.</p>
      <p>“<i>Significant drop in the PMS evacuation from fuel depots noted since August 22nd may be connected to border closure and other interventions of the security agencies aimed at curbing smuggling. We will contain smuggling of the PMS,</i>” Mele Kyari, Group Managing Director, NNPC.</p>
