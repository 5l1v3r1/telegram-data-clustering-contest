      <h2>2020 Ssangyong Tivoli launched in the Philippines, ditches gas for diesel power</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T14:31:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 14:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/author/pablo-salapantan.html" target="_blank">Pablo Salapantan</a></address>
      <p>In 2016 Ssangyong made a comeback to the Philippines market, and one of the vehicles they featured upon their return was the Tivoli crossover. Three years since, the Tivoli has been one of the top sellers for the South Korean brand.</p>

      <p>Now, Ssangyong Philippines has brought in the facelifted version of their subcompact crossover. The refreshed Tivoli exterior now features redesigned headlights and front highlights with sloping lines that make their way to the center to showcase 'a more dynamic sense of movement'. A bigger air intake at the bottom of the front bumper improve the engines ability to keep cool. All these make the Tivoli’s facelift bang up to date.</p>

      <p>Its biggest update though comes from under the hood. For the Tivoli, the gasoline-powered engines have been replaced by oil-burner diesel engines. In the past, the diesel engine was only available in the long-wheelbase XLV. Now, even this regular length model comes standard with the said turbodiesel. Specifically, it's an updated e-XDi160 that see's power increased over the previous iteration with 136 PS and a maximum torque of 324 Nm. It is then mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission for better fuel economy at high speed driving.</p>

      <p>For the inside, Ssangyong has done away with the two-tone beige and black colorway. Instead, they have now gone for a black on piano black look, with a steel aluminum finish that runs through the length of the dashboard. The seats and door panels were also rid of the two-tone look, opting for just plain black to make the whole interior ensemble tie together with black and aluminum as the only color pallet available.</p>
      <p>There are two variants to choose from for the 2020 Tivoli, and these are the 1.6 Diesel Sport and 1.6 Diesel Premium. Exterior differences between the two variants is that the Premium feature LED Daylight running lights and power fold side mirrors with LED turn light signals and 18-inch diamond cut finished alloy wheels, while the Sport has a standard halogen lighting system, folding side mirrors and 16-inch aluminum wheels.</p>

      <p>The differences are more highlighted through the interior, with the Premium having a 10.25-inch fully digital “Super Vision” gauge cluster as opposed to the 3.25-inch semi-digital cluster of the Sport. Not to mention, the Premium comes with an 8-inch touchscreen smart audio infotainment system with Bluetooth, Apple Carplay and Andrioid Auto connectivity, while the Sport only has a 6.2-inch touchscreen with Bluetooth and USB connectivity.</p>

      <p>Ssangyong brings this new Tivoli into a very crowded and hotly contested segment, but offers something some of its competition lacks, which is standard diesel power.</p>
      <p>Pricing is as follows:<br/><br/>Tivoli 1.6 Diesel Sport: Php 1,180,000<br/>Tivoli 1.6 Diesel Premium: Php 1,290,000</p>
