      <h3>In 2008, Mike Zimmer was doing a lot of rock climbing and found that his hands were feeling dry, cracked and damaged.</h3>
      <p>He was using a natural salve to help, and one day, after taking a look at the ingredients, he realized he could probably make his own at home.</p>
      <p>“When I looked at the ingredients I realized I had half of the stuff in my cupboard already — beeswax candles, olive oil, tea tree oil,” Zimmer says. “So I started experimenting with that, and as time went on, those experiments got more and more involved.”</p>
      <p>Today, Zimmer is the proud owner of Uncle Mike’s All Natural Products, a Saskatoon-based company that makes handmade body products like soap, shampoo bars, beard oil, lip balm, deodorant and more, all from 100 per cent natural ingredients.</p>
      <p>“The healing salve was the first thing I made, and from there I just started working through the list of products that my wife and I used, replacing the stuff in our medicine cabinet. At that point I wasn’t in a business mindset, I was just doing it for myself and my family, and asking how I could make the best products for what we needed,” he recalls.</p>
      <p>With the goal of being as natural as possible in all areas of his life, Zimmer lives and breathes sustainability. He originally grew up on an acreage outside Saskatoon, and works closely with his family to produce food from the land. They have a large garden, a chicken coop, and have kept bees in the past.</p>
      <p>Zimmer says he got interested in living sustainably after a work injury forced him to spend five months in bed.</p>
      <p>“In the early stages of me even using natural products, I messed up my back at work. I was doing physiotherapy three times a week and was given pain medication. But then I had an epiphany that there are simply other options out there, and I got interested in how the things we put on our bodies and in our bodies react inside of us.”</p>
      <p>Beyond skin care, Zimmer became interested in a whole body approach.</p>
      <p>“This includes the food we’re eating, the air we’re breathing, what we’re putting on our skin, pharmaceutical drugs and more. A lot of the time, the products we use are tested individually, but they’re not tested for how they might react with other things we’ve put into our system or on our skin,” he says.</p>
      <p>While he was making lifestyle changes, Zimmer also left his career in engineering consulting. He was working on his natural products as a side hobby, but quickly realized he wanted it to become more than that.</p>
      <p>“It was a pretty quick left turn from what I was doing. There’s a lot of waste in the construction industry and I was on the road a lot, so I left because I wanted to be on a different path for my life.”</p>

      <p>After leaving his job, Zimmer started working in a high school with kids with disabilities, which opened up more time for him to work on developing natural products and attend artisan fairs and festivals during the summer months. When his son was born in 2011, he decided to stay at home and grow his hobby into a full-time job.</p>
      <p>“My lab was in my basement at home to start, and I would just go down there and start tinkering away. Everything is a calculation; it’s chemistry, really. Once I’ve figured out a product I want to make and what goes into it, I develop the recipe and then work through trial and error,” he says, adding that the trial and error process is a lot easier today than it was 10 years ago, due to the knowledge he’s accumulated.</p>
      <p>The key ingredients in many of his products are cold-pressed vegetable oils and waxes, like coconut oil and beeswax. He adds steamed or distilled essential oils, based on their therapeutic properties. In his deodorant recipe, for example, the blend of essential oils has specific antibacterial properties that kill bacteria that cause odour.</p>
      <p>“All of my products are made for a purpose, they’re not just made to smell nice,” Zimmer says. “Even now you see a lot of products on the market that claim to be natural but they’re actually just naturally-derived. They might start with a natural coconut oil, for example, but then it is put through a process where certain things are pulled from the oil using chemicals to separate it or thin it out.”</p>
      <p>For Zimmer, the idea of products being truly all natural means that they are from the earth, but also that they can return to the earth.</p>
      <p>“One thing that is important is that the products are biodegradable, so you could use them in the lake. There shouldn’t be a trail of junk left behind from body products. I feel that it is my duty as a citizen of the earth to do what I can to minimize my footprint. By using natural products and producing them, I’m just trying to lessen my footprint.”</p>
      <p>Zimmer says one of his favourite quotes is “Respect the past, invent the future,” which is from a punk metal band out of Medicine Hat called Western Death. The quote resonates with him as it’s parallel to his approach to sustainability, he says.</p>
      <p>“The coolest thing in the process is that all of these things we use, whether it’s cosmetics, cleaning products, deodorizers, whatever, it all started out as a natural product years ago, with our grandparents or great-grandparents, before chemical byproducts and cheaper ways of making these things existed. So that quote resonates with what I’m doing by trying to make things better — trying to invent the future by going back to the natural way.”</p>
      <p>One of the first local retailers to carry his products in Saskatoon was The Better Good. Co-owner Laura Neufeld says they started stocking them based on Zimmer’s mandate.</p>
      <p>“We’ve been carrying them since 2013 because they fit with our goal of being environmentally and socially sustainable,” Neufeld says. “And Mike is just a really amazing guy. He’s dedicated to supporting other makers and I think he really portrays his business in how he lives. His values are truly reflected in his actions every day in how he runs his business and conducts himself.”</p>
      <p>Neufeld echoes Zimmer’s concerns about mainstream body products, which she says are filled with harmful substances.</p>
      <p>“Typical body products are generally filled with all kinds of things like chemicals. Basically what you put on your body, you’re consuming. We believe that if you wouldn’t eat something because it’s toxic or dangerous, then you probably shouldn’t put it on your skin because you’re still absorbing everything. And that’s just the health standpoint — then there’s also the environmental component of how things are made and where they’re made,” she says.</p>
      <p>Neufeld says the products are very popular and part of the reason can be attributed to the fact that they work.</p>
      <p>“With the salve, I’ve had people say they’ve stopped using their cortisol cream or something that their doctor had prescribed for their eczema or psoriasis, which is great to hear,” Zimmer says, adding that his favourite part of the process is experimenting to see what he can come up with.</p>
      <p>Since Uncle Mike’s has grown, the business has moved from his basement lab to a workshop in Saskatoon’s Riversdale neighbourhood in 2018. He also works closely with his brother, who assists with product production.</p>
      <p>“I’m still very much involved. For me, that’s why I started this and that’s what I enjoy the most. I was brought up with a very strong work ethic, so I enjoy the fact that there’s no real ceiling to what I could do or want to do, with the exception of time and money. I just wanna make soap.”</p>
      <p>Overall, Zimmer says Uncle Mike’s really just grew from a place of wanting to do his part, and giving others the opportunity to do the same.</p>
      <p>“When it comes to things that I use or consume, I feel that I should be able to make it or grow it. Why can’t I? Somebody else is making it or growing it anyways, and we need to be conscious of where things come from,” he says.</p>
      <p>“I like to think that I’m doing something that’s good for me, good for the planet, and good for everyone.”</p>
