      <p>A court in <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/vietnam.html">Vietnam</a> has jailed a music teacher for 11 years for a series of posts on <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/facebook.html">Facebook</a> that the government said were "anti-state".</p>
      <p>Nguyen Nang Tinh, 43, was accused of "making and spreading anti-state information and materials" at a one-day trial on Friday at the People's Court in the northern-central province of Nghe An, Nguyen Van Mieng, Tinh's lawyer said.</p>
      <p>Mieng said his client denied the accusations, saying the offending Facebook account did not belong to him.Â </p>
      <p>"The prosecutors stuck to the idea that the Facebook user named Nguyen Nang Tinh and my client Nguyen Nang Tinh are the same person."</p>
      <p>Tinh, who teaches music at a provincial college, was arrested in May after he was found writing and sharing anti-state posts and videos on his Facebook account, the police said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Late last month, a 54-year-old architect was jailed for 12 months over accusations he uploaded anti-state posts to his Facebook account, police said in a separate statement on the department's website.</p>
      <p>Facebook is widely used in Vietnam and serves as the main platform for both e-commerce and dissent. In January, Vietnam accused Facebook of violating the law by allowing users to post anti-government comments.</p>
      <p>The United States <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/social-media.html">social media</a> giant said in May that it had increased the amount of content it restricted access to in Vietnam by more than 500% in the last half of 2018.</p>
      <p>"Nguyen Nang Tinh is the latest in a long line of dissidents targeted for posting information and criticism on Facebook," John Sifton, Asia advocacy director at <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/human-rights-watch.html">Human Rights Watch</a> said in a statement on Thursday, ahead of the trial.</p>
      <p>Tinh would be placed under house arrest for five years after serving his jail term, his lawyer said.</p>
