      <h1>Bossa Nova Launches Automated Inventory Solution</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T14:39:43+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 14:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pymnts.com/author/pymnts/" target="_blank">PYMNTS</a></address>
      <p>Data service provider <a href="https://www.bossanova.com/">Bossa Nova</a> announced it has developed a new artificial intelligence (AI) and automated solution for inventory data management, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/11/14/bossa-nova-unveils-inventory-robot-for-small-stores/">according to reports</a>.</p>
      <p>The company already offers technology to automate the collection and analysis of on-shelf inventory data, enabling retailers to improve product availability, streamline operations and create a better shopping experience for customers. In a September <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/retail/2019/taking-stock-of-whats-in-stock-with-retail-robots/">interview</a> with PYMNTS, Martin Hitch, co-founder of Bossa Nova, explained that automating the inventory tracking, stocking and shelving processes would have a ripple effect of improving retail operations.</p>
      <p>Now with the launch of the Bossa Nova 2020, which will be available to view at NRF 2020, brick-and-mortar retailers can attain real-time “state of the store” insights, with the goal of streamlining operations and optimizing the customer experience.</p>
      <p>The solution’s slimmer design allows it to navigate the narrow aisles that are common at medium- and small-format stores. It also has intelligence capabilities in fresh food, frozen food and apparel departments that provide insight for a store of any size. The solution’s smart 2D and 3D camera system, along with an industry-leading AI stack, aims to deliver reliable and accurate data to retailers. The custom-designed camera boasts multi-focus, high-speed and high-resolution optics so the robot can see the full depth of shelves.</p>
      <p>“Bossa Nova 2020 is the culmination of six years of retail experience, 55 petabytes of data collected and one million aisles analyzed,” Sarjoun Skaff, co-founder and chief technology officer at Bossa Nova, said in a <a href="https://www.bossanova.com/post/bossa-nova-announces-next-generation-retail-data-solution-to-provide-actionable-insight-for-the-whole-store">press release</a>. “Bossa Nova provides business intelligence for retail, and we are so proud to have some of the world’s largest retailers trust us to answer their toughest questions. By expanding analytics to the whole store and giving medium and small-format retailers the same real-time visibility into shelf insights, we’re empowering retailers globally with data to redesign their store operations.”</p>
