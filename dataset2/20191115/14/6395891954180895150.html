      <p><b>WOOSTER, OhioÂ (AP)</b> - A whitetail went retail for a bit this week when it entered a Walmart store in Ohio.</p>
      <p>Patrons in Wooster in northeastern Ohio say the deer was kicking shelves as it walked through the store Wednesday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Bert and Dawn Moore encountered the deer after stopping in for a few things for dinner. Bert Moore told the Wooster Daily Record he feared the doe was in danger of hurting itself or others.</p>
      <p>Moore says he grabbed the deer when it grew tired after slipping on the floor and then lay on it to keep it still.</p>
      <p>He, another shopper and store employees helped the animal get out. It disappeared into a field.</p>
