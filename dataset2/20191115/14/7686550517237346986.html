        <figcaption>The mouth-watering food on offer at the <b>Cardiff Christmas Market</b></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The festive feeling has gripped Cardiff as the city's <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink-news/8-food-drink-stalls-you-17257594">Christmas Market</a> is back.</p>
      <p>And while there <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/cardiff-christmas-lights-switch-on-17254715">isn't an official lights switch-on</a> this year, there's still <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/winter-wonderland-cardiff-ice-skating-17217869">Winter Wonderland</a> and the wooden chalets to help you get in the seasonal spirit.</p>
      <p>Many of the market stalls have returned for another year, bringing with them their festive food and drinks.</p>
      <p>However, these markets have a reputation for being on the pricey side, so we decided to see how they compare to last year's costings.</p>
      <p>And while a number of stalls have kept their prices steady, a few have introduced slight increases to the cost of their goods.</p>
      <p>Here's how the <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink-news/8-food-drink-stalls-you-17257594">Cardiff Christmas Market</a> prices compare to 2018.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Melted Cheese Company</b>
      </p>
      <p>This gooey, melted cheese hut is always a firm favourite.</p>
      <p>And good news for cheese lovers, the prices haven't budged since last year.</p>
      <p>Here are this year's prices:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Traditional Raclette (melted cheese with garlic baby potatoes) - £6</li>
