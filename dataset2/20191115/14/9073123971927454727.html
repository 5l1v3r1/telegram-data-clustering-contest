      <p><b>Epic has added yet another collaboration to Fortnite, this time joining forces </b><b>(no pun intended)</b> <b>with the most popular franchise in the world. Find out how to get the Fortnite Imperial Stormtrooper skin for free.</b></p>
      <p>It’s been months since the last “Fortnite X” collaboration, so it feels like we were due for this one.</p>
      <p>Star Wars and Fortnite were bound to cross paths at some point, and it appears as though the release of <i>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order </i>was enough to get Epic involved.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>At midnight EST on November 15, Epic add an Imperial Army ship to Fortnite. If you look closely, you can even see it in the sky off the coast of the island.</p>

      <p>The skin costs 1,500 V-Bucks if you want to buy it as a standalone product. You don’t need to spend money on the skin by itself, however, especially if you’re interested in buying the new Star Wars game.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>You can get the skin for free by purchasing <i>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</i> in the Epic Games store. Eager players who have already purchased the game could get a refund and re-purchase the game to receive the free skin.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, this means that we console plebs can’t get the skin for free. We don’t have an option as to where we can purchase our games.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>The real question, now, is whether or not this skin is the end of the Fortnite X Star Wars crossover. Will we be getting other skins from the franchise? We can only hope.</p>
