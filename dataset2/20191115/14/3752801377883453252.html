      <h1>WATCH | Beast 'arm wrestles' Whitey Basson as Boks braai with Johann Rupert and friends</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T14:25:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 14:25</time> by <a rel="author">Riaan Grobler and Sharlene Rood</a></address>
      <p>Former Shoprite executive and billionaire Whitey Basson got a taste of the strength of Tendai "Beast" Mtawarira as the two arm wrestled at a braai celebrating the 2019 Rugby World Cup champions, hosted by Richemont chairperson Johann Rupert on his farm L'Ormarins near Franschhoek on Saturday. </p>
      <p>In a video Rupert posted on Twitter, Mtawarira and Basson can be seen "wrestling" things out on a table as bystanders chant "Whitey! Whitey!"</p>
      <p>"You're winning, you're winning..." Mtawarira encourages the former business mogul.</p>
      <p>Basson then "beats" the mighty Beast, who sports a huge smile throughout the affair. </p>
      <p>Rupert jokingly told News24 that "Beast was wonderful - he could have put Whitey in hospital". </p>
      <p>"After 2007 [when John Smit's team won the World Cup], we hosted a braai for the Boks at L’Ormarins. The 2019 team had asked if they could also have a braai if they won. That was last weekend, but unfortunately [Springbok captain] Siya [Kolisi] and [Springbok coach] Rassie [Erasmus] could not be there - they had to attend an awards event in Durban," Rupert said. </p>
      <p>Rupert posted a series of pictures of the braai on his Twitter feed, at one point remarking: "Die manne is GROOT" (these guys are huge), and "Now I know what poor England had to face" as he poses between locks RG Snyman and Eben Etzebeth, who tower head and shoulders above the businessman. </p>
      <p>Rupert also sent this picture of a thrilled Mtawarira and Springbok fly-half Handrè Pollard after they were congratulated by American football quarterback Tom Brady via Facetime.</p>
      <p>"Brady is an old friend," Rupert said. </p>
