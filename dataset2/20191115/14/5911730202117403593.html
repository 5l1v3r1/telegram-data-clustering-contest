      <h1>White House releases rough transcript of Trump's first Ukraine call with Zelensky</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T14:21:59+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 14:21</time> by <a rel="author">CNN Newsource</a></address>
      <p>WASHINGTON – The <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2019/11/14/politics/ukraine-transcripts-white-house-release/index.html">White House has released on Friday a transcript of President Donald Trump's</a> first phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart.</p>
      <p>The call, which occurred on April 21, came just after Volodymyr Zelensky was elected president.</p>
      <p>It doesn't contain any mentions of the Bidens or the 2016 election, as a later July call did.</p>
      <p>The release of the first call came after a month-and-a-half-long debate among aides over the wisdom of making another conversation public.</p>
      <p>"I have many friends in Ukraine who know you and like you," Trump tells Zelensky in the call.</p>
      <p>Trump does tell Zelensky he looked forward to working with him in the future.</p>
      <p>"We'll have a lot of things to talk about, but we're with you all the way," Trump said.</p>
      <p>And he mentions his onetime ownership of the Miss Universe franchise.</p>
      <p>"Ukraine was always very well represented," he said.</p>
      <p>The document, which has been circulating in the White House, has been the subject of debate over the last month. Internal disputes, political maneuvering and <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2019/11/13/politics/public-impeachment-hearings-day-1/index.html">diplomatic differences complicated its rollout</a> , people familiar with the matter said.</p>
      <p>Trump first raised the prospect of releasing the log of an April phone call with Volodomyr Zelensky on September 25, insisting it would help reenforce his innocence in the then-nascent impeachment crisis. He said at the time that Vice President Mike Pence's phone conversations should also be made public.</p>
      <p>Ever since, White House advisers have debated the wisdom of releasing additional conversations with Zelensky after a transcript of Trump's July phone call failed to quiet allegations he was pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rivals.</p>
      <p>Trump said last weekend he would probably release the transcript on Tuesday. Tuesday came and went, and he announced on Wednesday the transcript would be released Thursday.</p>
      <p>On Thursday morning, a White House official said timing of the release was "up in the air."</p>
      <p>Even though the additional phone calls are not seen as troubling inside the White House, some officials view releasing any additional information as risky. They believe Democrats will find a way to weaponize the transcripts, and are wary of providing any more fuel to the impeachment fire. And even some officials not aligned with Trump see a dangerous precedent in releasing transcripts of a president's conversations with foreign leaders.</p>
