      <p>LEE COUNTY, Fla. -- Southwest Florida Crime Stoppers is asking local students for help tracking down the person responsible for a written threat at Riverdale High School earlier this week.</p>
      <p>According to Crime Stoppers, on Wednesday a student at Riverdale reported seeing a threat written on a soap dispenser in one of the boys restrooms. The message was penned in black magic marker and stated “finna shoot the school.”</p>
      <p>School Resource Officers and detectives immediately started investigating the threat, which was proven to be non-credible. However, investigators say the case will not be closed until the student responsible is identified and charged accordingly.</p>
      <p>“The message about the seriousness of making school threats is loud and clear. Every single one of these actions is treated with the highest level of priority, to ensure that our schools are safe,” said Trish Routte, Crime Stoppers Coordinator. “Yesterday’s tragic event in California is a sad reminder that students always need to be on the lookout for any kind of suspicious activity or behavior and to be sure to report instances like the threat at Riverdale High School to Crime Stoppers, completely anonymously. We hope that parents will take this opportunity to revisit this conversation with their teenagers so that they are absolutely clear about the consequences that can follow.”</p>
      <p>Anyone with information on the written threat at Riverdale is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-780-TIPS (8477). All callers will remain anonymous and will be eligible for a cash reward of up to $3,000.
