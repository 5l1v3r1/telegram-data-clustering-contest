      <p>The first seizure occurred in the afternoon of November 7, when U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers made contact with the driver of a commercial Ford truck. Officers referred the driver, a 58-year-old Mexican national, for a secondary inspection where a drug detection dog alerted to an odor. Further searches led to the discovery of nearly 30 packages of cocaine concealed within a water storage tank. Officers estimated the value of the cocaine at roughly $8.8 million.</p>
      <p>The driver was turned over to investigative personnel from the U.S. Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) for a determination of charges.</p>
      <p>The next seizure occurred on November 11, after CBP officers made contact with a 31-year-old female Tucson resident driving a GMC truck. A K-9 officer alerted to more than 70 concealed packages inside the fuel tank. The bags held 74 pounds of methamphetamine valued at more than $66,000 and three pounds of fentanyl with an estimated value of $34,000.</p>
      <p>The driver was arrested and turned over to HSI for criminal charges.</p>
