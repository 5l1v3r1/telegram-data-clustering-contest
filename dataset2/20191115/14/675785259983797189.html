      <h1>Disney+ adds warning for racist content in classic films like Peter Pan, Dumbo</h1>
      <h2>Disney+ is taking a responsible approach to potentially offensive content by giving clear disclaimers for its oldest films with racist depictions</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T14:34:19+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 14:34</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Knight, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/lewis-knight/</a></address>
      <p>Disney+ is warning its viewers with disclaimers for offensive content in some of its older titles.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/media/470524-disney-adds-disclaimers-for-racist-depictions-in-old-movies-like-peter-pan">The Hill</a>, some disclaimers have been shown on classic titles such as Dumbo and Peter Pan.</p>
      <p>Dumbo contains a scene with the character of Jim Crow, who was seen as a stereotype of African-Americans, while the portrayal of Native Americans in Peter Pan also received a disclaimer.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, The Aristocats and The Lady and The Tramp were criticised for offensive Asian acents.</p>
      <p>The disclaimer notes on the films that: "It may contain outdated cultural depictions."</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/debanjalibose/disney-disclaimer-racism-popular-movies">Buzzfeed News</a>, a scene from Fantasia has been edited out featuring a dark-skinned centaur serving its lighter-skinned counterparts.</p>

      <p>One film that is not part of the viewing library on Disney+ is the 1946 film Song of the South, which grossed $65 million dollars on its release and won Best Original Song at the Academy Awards for "Zip-a-Dee-Do-Dah".</p>
      <p>The film, which followed a young white boy going to live on his grandfather's plantation following the American Civil War and befriending an African-American man named Uncle Remus, has been widely recognised for its offensive racists stereotypes.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/apr/23/disney-plus-streaming-site-will-not-offer-racist-song-of-the-south-film">The Guardian</a>, Disney CEO Bob Iger previously said in 2011 that a release of the film on home media "wouldn't necessarily sit right or feel right to a number of people today".</p>
      <p>Do you think Disney are taking the right approach?</p>
