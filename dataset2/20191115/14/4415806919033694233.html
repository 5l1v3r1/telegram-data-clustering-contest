      <h1>Maria Bailey was removed from FG ticket in a 'democratic' process, Donohoe insists</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T14:01:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 14:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/elaine-loughlin/" target="_blank">By Elaine Loughlin</a></address>
      <p>Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe has insisted that Maria Bailey was removed from the Fine Gael election ticket in a democratic manner.</p>
      <p>Mr Donohoe, who met the swing-gate TD ahead of Thursday night's Fine Gael executive council meeting to inform her of the proposal to cut her as a party candidate, said she had handled the issue in a "dignified and composed" way.</p>
      <p>Councillor Jennifer Carroll MacNeill has been added to the ticket in Dun Laoghaire after Fine Gael HQ accepted a local motion asking for changes.</p>
      <p>Asked about any potential action Ms Bailey may now take to contest the decision, Mr Donohoe said: "It's a very much a much a matter for Deputy Bailey regarding the response to what happened last night. Last night was a democratic decision that was made by the Executive Council."</p>
      <p>Speaking in Dublin's north inner city, Mr Donohoe said the controversy had caused public debate but had also been very difficult for Ms Bailey herself.</p>
      <blockquote>I'm conscious of how much of this has played out in the public eye and in the public arena. This is a matter that was a cause of a very significant amount of local debate within the Fine Gael organisation in Dun Laoghaire.</blockquote>
      <p>"They made a decision in relation to the motion calling on the Executive Council to review the ticket and the general election candidates for Dun Laoghaire for Fine Gael," he said.</p>
      <p>Speaking about his meeting with Ms Bailey earlier this week, Mr Donohoe said: "I indicated that the decision making process of this sits with the Executive Council, and our proposal would be going to the Executive Council in relation to her candidacy. I felt it was appropriate.</p>
      <blockquote>I would have to say that in the engagement that I had with her it was handled by her in a very very dignified and composed way.</blockquote>
