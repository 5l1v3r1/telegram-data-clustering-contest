      <p>Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch will testify Friday at 9 a.m. ET in front of the House Intelligence Committee as part of the committee’s impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <p>Yovanovitch was the ambassador to Ukraine until May, when she was removed by President Trump. Presidents can recall ambassadors for any reason, but Yovanovitch has testified in a closed-door deposition that she was “upset” and “shocked” about her removal.</p>
      <p>She has <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/15/impeachment-inquiry-cheat-sheet-marie-yovanovitchs-past-testimony/">testified</a> she was the target of a smear campaign by some Ukrainian officials, who enlisted the help of Rudy Giuliani and others to remove her. Democrats hope her testimony will draw <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/14/democrats-hope-marie-yovanovitchs-testimony-will-draw-sympathy-from-americans/">sympathy</a> from the American public, as a “victim” of the Trump administration’s policy on Ukraine.</p>
