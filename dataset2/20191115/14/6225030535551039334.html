      <p>Due to projections of rain from Tuesday through Thursday of next week in San Diego, Del Mar announced its Thursday, Nov. 21, card has been canceled.</p>
      <p>This action was due to “an abundance of caution,” said DMTC officials as the inclement weather was likely to result in a muddy main track and soft turf course. Entries for next Thursday’s card were scheduled to be taken Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>The Del Mar Thoroughbred Club consulted with industry stakeholders, including the Thoroughbred Owners of California and its regulator, the California Horse Racing Board, about the cancellation. All parties agreed that the move provided for the safest possible racing environment.</p>
      <p>“We know this is unusual for Del Mar,” said DMTC’s executive vice president for racing, Tom Robbins, “but equine and rider safety is always our primary concern. We’ll make a call next week as to whether or not we’ll have training on Wednesday and Thursday.</p>
      <p>"We plan on drawing entries for next Friday’s card this Sunday and we’ll race, weather-permitting.”</p>
      <p>Racing will be conducted as planned this Friday, Saturday and Sunday with first post at 12:30 p.m. PT on all days.</p>
