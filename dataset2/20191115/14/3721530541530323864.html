      <p>A new Pokémon game means one thing for patient monster collectors: another Shiny hunt. There’s always a small chance that creature encounters will come in a special color variety, making “shinies” a highly sought-after commodity. Typically, players intent on amassing a Shiny collection tend to <a href="https://kotaku.com/some-pokemon-players-are-spending-hours-restarting-sun-1789140572">restart their new games over and over again</a>, sometimes over the course of several hours, all in the hopes of finding a Shiny starter Pokémon. But that tradition may be ending with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/pokemon-sword-shield/40501"><i>Pokémon</i> <i>Sword</i> and <i>Shield</i></a>, the latest mainline entries in the series.</p>
      <p>According to Pokémon hacker <a href="https://twitter.com/Kaphotics/status/1193913436834537473">@kaphotics</a>, Game Freak has implemented a “shiny lock” on legendaries and starters. This means that there’s zero chance for these monsters to appear as a Shiny variant, at least through natural means. Fans can and have hacked impossible monsters into their games before, however.</p>

      <p>Of course, this doesn’t mean you can’t get Grookey, Scorbunny, or Sobble in a unique color. But rather that restarting your games, you’ll have to rely on good, old-fashioned breeding. But hey, at least you’ll start your Galar adventure faster now, right? Well, unless you want to get a specific nature from the get-go ...</p>
