      <p>This afternoon, China’s Samsung officially published <a href="https://m.ithome.com/html/457212.htm">a detailed description</a> of the Exynos 9611 processor. If the naming doesn’t attract you, it’s the smart chip developed for smartphones.</p>
      <p>Samsung’s new Exynos 9611 mobile processor has a built-in artificial intelligence engine, which also includes a visual processing unit. In addition to providing a smarter operating experience for mobile devices, it also provides intelligent enhancements for photo capture function.</p>

      <p>However, AI is the core advantage of this chip. This technology is critical for the next generation of mobile devices. So the Exynos 9611 provides artificial intelligence through deep learning technology. For example, the visual image processing unit has a digital signal processor and a neural network engine that can analyze the analog signals of images and videos to identify objects and environments in the shooting scene.</p>
      <p>In terms of shooting itself, the Exynos 9611 is equipped with an AI technology that recognizes scenes through a visual image processing unit. It can fine-tune various types of photography settings (white balance, saturation, contrast, etc.) to make photos better. It also supports multiple camera combinations of intelligent depth sensing. In addition, Exynos 9611’s MFC (Multi-Format Codec) supports HEVC (H.265) and H.264, which can encode and decode 4K 120 frames videos.</p>
      <p>Finally, the core performance of the Exynos 9611 has been improved a lot. The chip consists of a 64-bit 8-core CPU (central processing unit). It uses an architecture of four 2.3GHz Cortex-A73 cores and four 1.7GHz Cortex-A53 cores. As for GPU, the SoC uses Mali- G72 MP3 graphics processor.</p>
