      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T14:18:40+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 14:18</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>Premier League footballer Christian Benteke has been slammed by a magistrate after he was banned from driving for a series of speeding offences.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> striker, who already had nine points on his licence for previous offences, was handed a 12-month road ban at London's Lavender Hill Magistrates Court on Friday.</p>
      <p>Chair of the bench Pamela Stokes said the 28-year-old Belgian international, who did not attend the hearing, had "fallen far short" of being a role model to fans.</p>
      <p>She said: "I note that Benteke is someone who has offended before, and I also noted the very high speeds recorded for these matters before us today.</p>
      <p>"Benteke is a well-known footballer who has many fans, and he should be seen as a role model to those fans - his offending has fallen far short of being a role model."</p>

      <p>The court heard Benteke, of Kingston Hill, Surrey, was caught driving his Bentley at 80mph in a 50mph zone on the A3 in Richmond, south-west London, on January 20.</p>
      <p>He was later clocked at 89mph in a 40mph zone on a stretch of the same road in Putney on March 11. He admitted both offences.</p>
      <p>He was also found guilty of driving the vehicle at 64mph in a 30mph zone in Streatham Place, south-west London, on July 22.</p>
      <p>Benteke was also ordered to pay £2,780 in fines, costs and surcharges.</p>

      <p>Benteke has endured a nightmare few years since leaving Aston Villa in 2015.</p>
      <p>He joined <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> in a £32.5m deal but failed to impress before being shipped to Crystal Palace the following year.</p>
      <p>After a bright start, Benteke has failed to impress sand has managed just four goals in two years.</p>
      <p>He has found opportunities limited under Roy Hodgson this season but did sign a new contract recently.</p>
