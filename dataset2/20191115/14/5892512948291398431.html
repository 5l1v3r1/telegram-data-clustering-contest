      <h1>PFL finalist Daniel Pineda reacts to positive drug test — ‘No steroids were found in my system’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T14:10:24+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 14:10</time> by <a rel="author">Jesse Holland</a></address>
      <p>Professional Fighters League (PFL) featherweight finalist, Daniel Pineda, was one fight away from being worth $1 million. Unfortunately, he’s now one drug test away from being worth $0, thanks to Nevada State Athletic Commission.</p>
      <p>“Damn, I guess them dick pills finally caught up to me... lol,” Pineda wrote on <a href="https://twitter.com/DanielPitPineda/status/1195118362403188738">Twitter</a>. “For the record no ‘steroids’ or drugs were found in my system!”</p>
      <p>Pineda (28-13) is scheduled to face Lance Palmer in the PFL finals on New Year’s Eve in New York; however, the New York State Athletic Commission (NYSAC) is unlikely to license “The Pit” unless he first clears his name with NSAC.</p>
      <p>Pineda, 34, competed twice under NSAC for the PFL playoffs in October.</p>
      <p>“Right now we’re in the process of researching what could have led to a positive test,” manager Jason House told <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2019/11/daniel-pineda-fails-drug-test-1-million-pfl-matchup-jeopardy">MMA Junkie</a>. “We plan on appealing the decision once all information is gathered.”</p>
      <p>No comment was available from either Palmer or PFL reps at the time of this writing.</p>
