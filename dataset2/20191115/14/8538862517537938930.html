      <p>Obsidian's <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/outer_worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> has done rather well for itself ever since its October launch with <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/news/2019/11/the_outer_worlds_sales_have_exceeded_expectations_seems_to_be_a_hit">sales that have exceeded expectations</a> the developer held prior to launch. It's a major success for the now Microsoft-owned company, and it looks like more content could be on its way.</p>
      <p>In an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-14-visiting-obsidian-post-acquisition-to-see-what-has-changed">interview with Eurogamer</a>, it is revealed that Obsidian still has a team working on post-launch support and content for the game despite the fact it has multiple other projects currently in the works. "People are obviously loving Outer Worlds and we made it because we love it, so now we get to keep on doing things to help support [it]."</p>
      <p>A content roadmap for The Outer Worlds hasn't been announced at the time of writing, but it looks like one could be on its way sooner rather than later. Are you hoping to head back to the RPG with new content in the future? Pass a speech check in the comments below.</p>
