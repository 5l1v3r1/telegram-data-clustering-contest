        <b>THE BROTHER of a Scots winner of a reality TV faces life in jail for brutally killing their other brother in a "ferocious" hammer attack.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Steven Loughton, 30, was acquitted of murder but convicted of the culpable homicide of his 26-year-old sibling Roddy at a house in Edinburgh last December.</p>

      <p>Loughton stood trial on a charge of murdering Roddy.</p>
      <p>But his lawyer Donald Findlay QC led evidence which showed he was suffering from mental health problems and was of diminished responsibility at the time of the incident.</p>
      <p>Mr Findlay also “agreed” with prosecutors that Roddy died as a consequence of being struck repeatedly on the head with a hammer by his client.</p>
      <p>On Friday, judge Lord Beckett said that the jury had accepted that Loughton’s responsibility was diminished by a personality disorder which made him emotionally unstable.</p>
      <p>He told Loughton he would be examined by court appointed social workers who would determine whether he met the requirements needed to impose an order for lifelong restriction.</p>
      <p>Lord Beckett said: “You killed your brother using ferocious violence. It’s not inevitable that there will be an order for lifelong restriction - the court will consider all sentencing options.”</p>

      <p>Loughton’s 31-year-old brother John won Channel 4’s Big Brother Celebrity Hijack in 2008.</p>
      <p>He studied sociology and politics at Stirling University when he entered the spin off show and is now a social entrepreneur.</p>
      <p>During proceedings, the court heard how Loughton attacked his brother on sometime on December 16 and 17 at a flat in Muirhouse Terrace, Edinburgh.</p>
      <p>Jurors heard that Loughton and Roddy were the “closest of friends” growing up. They had spent the day before Roddy died enjoying each other’s company.</p>

      <p>However, Loughton attacked Roddy and caused his death.</p>
      <p>The court heard from a psychiatrist that Loughton has difficulty controlling his emotions.</p>
      <p>He had reported becoming depressed and anxious in his early 20s and had began to regularly self harm. He had been previously admitted to a psychiatric hospital.</p>
      <p>During a phone call following the attack, Loughton claimed he had suffered a blackout and said: “They should never have released me from the Royal Edinburgh.”</p>
      <p>The court also heard from Loughton’s former girlfriend Lisa Hamilton,28.</p>

        <figcaption>He was found guilty of culpable homicide</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>She told the court that he forwarded a mobile phone photograph of Roddy lying injured to her.</p>
      <p>She said that he sent her a series of messages through social media on the morning of December 17 seeking to speak to her.</p>
      <p>In one message, Loughton said: “I’m in bits.” He then asked her if she was pregnant and she told him she was not.</p>
      <p>He then told her that he had killed someone and asked her who his favourite family member was.</p>
      <p>Miss Hamilton told the court that she did not believe what she was being told and Loughton sent her the picture of Roddy lying injured.</p>
      <blockquote>You killed your brother using ferocious violence. It’s not inevitable that there will be an order for lifelong restriction - the court will consider all sentencing options.”</blockquote>
      <p>During the messages between Loughton and Miss Hamilton, the court heard that she said: “I’m assuming Roddy isn’t dead and that you are just being a lying bam.”</p>
      <p>She said she didn’t believe him and wasn’t expecting the picture she was sent.</p>
      <p>She then replied: “FFS you are a monster.”</p>
      <p>Miss Hamilton also said that Loughton had also telephoned her and said that he had hit Roddy with a hammer and “kept going”.</p>
      <p>She told the police: “I asked Steven to check Roddy’s pulse and he said that Roddy was cold.”</p>
      <p>She told the court that she previously had been in a relationship with Steven Loughton during which he accused her of cheating on him with another man.</p>
      <p>She added: “He accused me quite frequently of having relations with Roddy. Not just Roddy, he accused me of sleeping with people I have never met before.”</p>
      <p>Following conviction, Mr Findlay urged Lord Beckett to treat his client with “compassion”.</p>
      <p>He said that his client’s mental health problems shouldn’t automatically lead him to being assessed for an order for lifelong restriction.</p>
      <p>He added: “Your lordship has heard of a man who through no fault of his own suffers from a personality disorder.</p>
      <p>There are hundreds of people who suffer personality disorders to varying degrees.</p>
      <p>“However, we do not lock them up solely for that reason.”</p>
      <p>However, Lord Beckett said Loughton should be assessed to ascertain whether he met the criteria needed to impose an OLR.</p>
      <p>Lord Beckett then thanked the jurors and told them they had been involved in a “very harrowing trial”.</p>
      <p>He deferred sentence on Loughton and the case will next call at the High Court in Glasgow in February 2020.</p>
