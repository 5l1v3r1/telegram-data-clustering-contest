      <p><b>Keanu Reeves</b> and <b>Alexandra Grant</b> are not planning a secret wedding in Malibu, despite a made-up tabloid report. <b>Gossip Cop</b> can debunk the story. It’s totally fabricated.</p>
      <p>As <b>Gossip Cop</b> reported, rumors emerged earlier this month that <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/keanu-reeves-alexandra-grant-dating-rumors-what-we-know/">Reeves is dating Grant</a>, his longtime friend and business partner, after the two held hands on the red carpet at the LACMA Art + Film Gala in Los Angeles. The romance remains unconfirmed and the actor’s rep hasn’t commented on the rumors. That hasn’t stopped <i><b>OK!</b></i> from taking their relationship to the next level.</p>
      <p>“Keanu recently asked Alexandra to marry him, and she said yes,” an alleged insider tells the magazine. “He popped the question about a month ago over a cozy dinner at home – Italian takeout, candlelight and Frank Sinatra music. He said he wanted them to spend the rest of their lives together, and then got down on one knee.” The supposed source further contends that the actor gave Grant a $200,000 vintage-inspired engagement ring, adding, “Alexandra was shocked, and she happily accepted.”</p>
      <p>From there, the publication says Reeves and Grant are planning to tie the knot in a “top-secret” wedding. “They want it to be next spring in Malibu,” says the questionable tipster, adding that it’s going to be a “simple” yet “romantic” celebration with “about 70 guests.” The seemingly imaginary source adds, “The ceremony will probably take place on the beach just as the sun is setting. It sounds fancy, but knowing Keanu, everything will be very intimate, laid-back and casual.”</p>
      <p><b>Gossip Cop</b> is still trying to get clarification as to whether Reeves and Grant are actually dating or if they’re just very close friends and collaborators. However, we can confirm there’s no Malibu wedding in the works. A source close to the situation tells us the outlet’s article is fabricated and all talk of an engagement is bogus.</p>
      <p>It must be mentioned, <i>OK!</i> has already proven to have zero insight into the actor’s personal life. This past January, <b>Gossip Cop</b> busted the tabloid for falsely claiming <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/sandra-bullock-keanu-reeves-boyfriend-bryan-randall/">Reeves was growing close to Sandra Bullock</a>, to the point where her boyfriend Bryan Randall was disturbed by it. Later that month, the outlet made up a story about <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/keanu-reeves-halle-berry-romance-dating/">Reeves developing a romance with Halle Berry</a>, his co-star in <i>John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum</i>.</p>
      <p>By July, the publication came up with a contradictory story about the <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/keanu-reeves-sandra-bullock-halle-berry-single/">reason Reeves has remained single for years</a>. In September, <b>Gossip Cop</b> called out the magazine for wrongly reporting <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/keanu-reeves-child-adopt/">Reeves would be adopting a child as a single father</a>. It’s worth noting, this latest piece says he’s been quietly dating Grant “for months.” If the tabloid knows that to be the case, then why did it report two months ago that he was single and adopting a baby by himself?</p>
      <p>The reason the tabloid’s stories about Reeves are all over the place is because they were all created out of thin air. The magazine is just using the latest romance rumors surrounding the actor to invent this phony narrative about a Malibu wedding. There’s no such ceremony being planned.</p>
