      <p>Hailing out of the ongoing AFM is <b>Barry Jay</b>’s <i><b>Killer Therapy</b></i>, the follow-up to the well-received <i>Ashes</i> from the fitness guru-turned-filmmaker. Rellik Pictures are representing the title at this year’s market.</p>
      <p>Bloody has the trailer for the movie, starring<i> Return of the Living Dead</i> alum <b>Thom Mathews</b>, who explores the disturbing thoughts and ensuing therapy sessions of a young man named Brian.</p>
      <p><b>PJ Soles</b> (<i>Halloween</i>),<b> Adrienne King</b> (<i>Friday the 13th</i>), <b>Daeg Faerch</b> (Rob Zombie’s <i>Halloween</i>),<b> Michael Qeliqi, Elizabeth Keener </b>and<b> Ivy George</b> also star.</p>
      <p>“Brian is a disturbed child with sociopathic tendencies dealing with a father who doesn’t love him, a mother unconvinced of his violent nature, and a newly adopted sister he believes is there to replace him. After a series of escalating violent incidents, he is bounced around from failed therapist to failed therapist, maturing into a young man still unable to escape his anger issues. When his life eventually falls apart by his own choices, Brian blames his series of failed therapists, embracing his dark nature and taking his revenge on everyone who ever wronged him – one by one, finally understanding that accepting who you are inside can be the best therapy.”</p>
