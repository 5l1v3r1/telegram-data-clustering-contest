      <h1>Asylum seeker Behrouz Boochani lashes Australian ‘dictatorship’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T14:39:20+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 14:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/newdaily/" target="_blank">The New Daily</a></address>
      <p>Kurdish-Iranian author and journalist Behrouz Boochani has excoriated the Australian government and says he’ll seek an extension to his New Zealand visa.</p>
      <p>“We can see there is some kind of dictatorship in Australia,” he said on Friday.</p>
      <p>“In Australia, I think democracy is broken.”</p>
      <p>Boochani <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/world/2019/11/14/refugee-behrouz-boochani-asylum-new-zealand/">arrived in New Zealand on Thursday night</a>, ending his long detention within Australia’s offshore processing system.</p>
      <p>His departure after more than six years on Manus Island was arranged in the most unlikely of manners: the 36-year-old accepted an invitation to speak at a writers’ festival in Christchurch later this month and the visa was arranged very simply.</p>
      <p>Boochani announced his exit on Thursday night, tweeting from Auckland that it was “so exciting to get freedom after more than six years”.</p>

      <p>He was welcomed by Christchurch mayor Lianne Dalziel on Friday, before speaking at a Word Christchurch event alongside Greens MP Golriz Ghahraman, an Iranian refugee.</p>
      <p>“I’m really happy that I am here in Christchurch,” Boochani said.</p>
      <p>“Almost seven years ago I left Iran because of my journalism and cultural activities.</p>
      <p>“I went to Australia to seek asylum there, to find a safe place. I knew Australia as a liberal democracy.</p>
      <p>“I expected that they would welcome me and at least consider my case.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately they exiled me to Manus Island, a remote place. In other words, I can say I left Iran because I didn’t want to live in prison but Australia jailed me.”</p>

      <p>Boochani arrived by boat on Christmas Island in July 2013. He was sent to Manus Island in Papua New Guinea a month later.</p>
      <p>While in detention, Boochani wrote a book, <i>No Friend but the Mountains: Writing from Manus Prison</i>, which won this year’s Victorian Prize for Literature and the National Biography Award – Australia’s richest literary prize.</p>
      <p>He also filmed a documentary of life in the Manus centre on a mobile phone, which has been seen in Australia, London and Berlin.</p>
      <p>Boochani has vowed not to return to PNG.</p>
      <p>“I will never go back to that place,” he told <i>The Guardian</i>.</p>
      <p>His route to New Zealand involved a 34-hour journey via The Philippines across six timezones.</p>
      <p>He has not revealed his long-term plans but hopes to stay in New Zealand beyond his current visa, which grants him a month-long stay.</p>
      <p>However, New Zealand immigration authorities scotched that idea on Friday.</p>
      <p>“He is in New Zealand on a one month limited visa for the specific purpose of speaking at a conference in Christchurch. He must depart before his visa expires,” Greg Patchell, deputy chief executive of Immigration New Zealand said.</p>
      <p>“If he claims asylum in New Zealand, an independent statutory process decides his claim. Government ministers have no role in this process.”</p>
      <p>While not mentioning him by name, Boochani eviscerated Australian Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton.</p>
      <p>“I don’t say that I understand Australia but I think I say that with a special understanding,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I was in Manus … just looking at Australia. I was seeing something that Australians couldn’t see.</p>
      <p>“When they exile us to Manus (government ministers) always talk about us like we are dangerous people, like we are rapists, like we are dangerous. With hate speech.”</p>
      <p>Later, he told ABC radio from Christchurch that he had a “great opportunity” to raise the issue of detainees being held in PNG.</p>
      <p>He said he wanted New Zealand to “put pressure on PNG actually to release those innocent people”.</p>
      <p>“I really would like to ask the New Zealand government to have a negotiation with PNG and Nauru directly,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Australia cannot make decisions for others.”</p>
      <p>Boochani said he would visit Auckland and Wellington while in New Zealand. He also hoped for a simple pleasure during his first day in Christchurch.</p>
      <p>“I want to walk on a long street just by myself,” he said.</p>
