      <h1>10,000 Dogs Needed For Aging Research</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T14:37:18+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 14:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.geek.com/author/stephanie_m/" target="_blank">Stephanie Mlot</a></address>
      <p>Old <a href="https://www.geek.com/tech/ai-could-help-diagnose-dogs-suffering-from-chronic-pain-1809799/">dogs</a> may be able to teach us new tricks.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://dogagingproject.org/">Dog Aging Project</a> aims to understand more about the length and strength of canine lifespans.</p>
      <p>The initiative—jointly operated by the University of Washington School of Medicine and Texas A&amp;M University College of Veterinary Medicine &amp; Biomedical Sciences—will create a nationwide community of dogs, owners, vets, researchers, and volunteers.</p>
      <p>Launched this week at the annual Gerontological Society of America meeting in Austin, Texas, the Dog Aging Project is in full swing.</p>
      <p>Pet owners can <a href="https://cdsweb07.fhcrc.org/redcap/surveys/?s=DYYDHK8HAP">go online to nominate</a> their pup as a candidate: You will need to provide comprehensive health and lifestyle information about the animal, as well as share its veterinary medical records.</p>
      <p>Dogs of all ages, sizes, sexes, and sterilizations living in all types of locations are invited to sign up. Healthy <a href="https://www.geek.com/tech/robot-dog-astro-can-sit-lie-down-and-save-lives-1800310/">hounds</a> and those with chronic illness will be considered.</p>

      <p>“All owners who complete the nomination process will become Dog Aging Project citizen scientists and their dogs will become members of the ‘pack,'” <a href="https://newsroom.uw.edu/news/calling-all-canines-national-dog-aging-project">according to</a> co-director Daniel Promislow. “Their information will allow us to begin carrying out important research on aging in dogs.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.geek.com/culture/scamp-the-tramp-wins-worlds-ugliest-dog-contest-1792978/">Pooches</a> will be followed throughout their lifetime—long or short—as scientists gather information about the 10,000 enrolled animals in an open-data platform.</p>
      <p>There are four key goals of the Dog Aging Project:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Develop tests to measure dogs’ changes in physical function as they grow older</li>
        <li>Integrate genome sequencing data with health measurements and behavioral traits</li>
        <li>Look for molecular predictors of disease, decline, or longevity</li>
        <li>Assess the effects of the drug rapamycin on cognition, heart function, healthspan, and lifespan</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The entire project is expected to take at least 10 years.</p>
      <p>“Aging is the major cause of the most common diseases, like cancer and heart problems,” according to researcher Matt Kaeberlein, a professor of pathology at the UW School of Medicine. “Dogs age more rapidly than people do and get many of our same diseases of aging, including cognitive decline.” </p>
      <p>“This project will contribute broadly to knowledge about aging in dogs and in people,” he added.</p>
      <p>The multi-institutional team’s goal is not merely to increase lifespan, but extend healthspan: the period spent free from disease.</p>
      <p>“It is important to me that our work benefits dogs directly,” vet Kate Creevy, associate professor at Texas A&amp;M’s College of Veterinary Medicine &amp; Biomedical Sciences, said in a statement. “But our work with dogs has the added value of shedding light on the human aging experience as well.”</p>
      <p>After all, improved quality of life in advanced age is a goal most people have for themselves, as well as their pets.</p>
