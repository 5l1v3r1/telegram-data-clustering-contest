      <p>London -<b> England</b> pace bowler <b>James Anderson</b> has revealed he is "progressing nicely" as he steps up his return from a calf injury.</p>
      <p>Anderson only bowled four overs in the first Ashes Test against Australia earlier this year before suffering the injury.</p>
      <p>England's all-time leading wicket-taker missed the rest of the Ashes and remains sidelined for the current tour of New Zealand.</p>
      <p>But on Friday the Lancashire star tweeted a video of him bowling in a net session alongside former England batsmen Marcus Trescothick and Jonathan Trott, as well as an encouraging update on his fitness.</p>
      <p>"Another day of building up my bowing. Progressing nicely. Happy the two guys on the right weren't batting!" Anderson said.</p>
      <p>Although Anderson was omitted from the New Zealand trip in order to build up his fitness, the 37-year-old could feature when England head to South Africa.</p>
      <p>The series in South Africa begins on Boxing Day and forms part of the ICC World Test Championship.</p>
