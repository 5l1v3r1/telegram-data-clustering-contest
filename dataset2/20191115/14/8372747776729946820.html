      <p>COLLIER COUNTY, Fla. -- Deputies arrested an Immokalee man on felony narcotics charges Thursday after they found cocaine and marijuana in his vehicle and more drugs inside his residence.</p>
      <p>According to the Collier County Sheriff's Office, 40-year-old Cleofas Yzaguirre is charged with trafficking cocaine, possession of marijuana over 20 grams, possession of a controlled substance, and possession of narcotic paraphernalia.</p>
      <p>Deputies say they were preparing to execute a narcotics search warrant at Yzaguirre’s New Market Road residence around 8:30 a.m. Thursday when they observed Yzaguirre leave the residence and drive away in a pickup truck.</p>
      <p>Deputies conducted a traffic stop on the pickup and asked Yzaguirre if he was in possession of any weapons he removed a knife from his pocket and directed them to a firearm inside the vehicle. Yzaguirre gave deputies permission to retrieve the firearm for safety purposes.</p>
      <p>While retrieving the firearm deputies smelled an overwhelming odor of cocaine inside the vehicle. A search of the vehicle turned up a mason jar containing bags of a white powder substance. The powder substance tested positive for cocaine and weighed 31.4 grams.</p>
      <p>Detectives with the Collier County Sheriff’s Office Vice and Narcotics Bureau executed the search warrant at Yzaguirre’s residence with Yzaguirre present. During the search, detectives found approximately 38 grams of raw marijuana, three vape cartridges which tested positive for marijuana and miscellaneous items of narcotic paraphernalia.</p>
      <p>Deputies placed Yzaguirre under arrest and transported him to the Collier County jail.</p>
