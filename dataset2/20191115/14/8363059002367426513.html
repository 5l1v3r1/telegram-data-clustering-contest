      <p>McDonalds isn't done talking about cardboard straws yet, as it would like the world to know that it has been working very hard with numerous teams of paper scientists to make one that's <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/05/mcdonalds-uk-boss-says-he-can-keep-a-paper-straw-stiff-for-30-minutes/">better than the old one</a>.</p>
      <p>The newer straw is to launch across Europe soon, and will be made from fully – or at least more easily now – recyclable materials this time too, just in case anyone wants to drag up other <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/08/mcdonalds-admits-its-paper-straws-cant-be-recycled/">past boring sucktube controversies</a>. A spokesperson for the [speech marks] restaurant [close speech marks] said: "Following feedback from customers, and as the packaging industry has evolved, the paper straws being rolled out are now stronger while remaining made of fully recyclable materials." [<a href="https://news.sky.com/story/mcdonalds-to-launch-evolved-paper-straw-after-customer-backlash-11861300">Sky News</a>]</p>
