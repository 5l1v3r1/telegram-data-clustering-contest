        <b>HMRC have hit back at claims they were responsible for Rangers going bust - after a bombshell report stated up to £50million could be wiped from the club's tax bill.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a tweet last night they insisted they "didn't miscalculate anything" and won the case in the Supreme Court.</p>

      <p>The shock report in The Times claimed the <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4952016/taxman-50m-blunder-rangers/">final EBT bill could be as low as £20m</a>.</p>
      <p>If this figure was known back in 2011, the Ibrox club <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4952016/taxman-50m-blunder-rangers/">may not have been plunged into financial turmoil</a> leading to liquidation.</p>
      <p>But Thomas Wallace, Head of Tax at London-based firm <a href="https://wttconsulting.co.uk/">WTT</a>, claimed in a Q&amp;A that <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4955264/rangers-hmrc-tax-case-ebt-expert/">HMRC did NOT make any serious mistakes</a> in the case.</p>
      <p>And the tax authority tonight took to social media to clarify their position on the matter.</p>
      <p>The HMRC press office wrote: "As widely reported today and to clarify: HMRC won against Rangers' tax avoidance in the Supreme Court, and did not miscalculate anything."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a <a href="http://bit.ly/2CLoo28">Gers fan group demanded a public inquiry</a> into the incident.</p>
      <p>Craig Whyte, 48, paid Sir David Murray, 68, the token sum of £1 in 2011 to take over Rangers. But they plunged into administration and liquidation the following year.</p>

      <p>Yorkshire businessman Charles Green, 65, left, led a consortium that paid £5.5million for the assets of the club, which started the 2012-13 season in the Third Division.</p>
      <p>Ex-Ibrox chairman John McClelland said if the tax bill in 2011 had been “at the level now reported” there would have been “more potential buyers” for the club.</p>
      <p>He added: “In my opinion, the outcome would have been different.”</p>
      <p>Finance guru John Cairns was a tax director with BDO when they liquidated Gers’ oldco.</p>
      <p>He said: “It’s a great surprise that the big tax case seemed to involve £70million and we’re now down to £20million.</p>
      <p>“I’m surprised that someone at the time didn’t check the figures.”</p>

      <p>The legal dispute with HMRC has eaten into the amount recouped by Gers’ creditors — who appear likely to get back just a few pence for every pound they were owed.</p>
      <p>By April 2018 BDO had brought in £29.8million of revenue and paid out £17.9million — including its own fees of £4.6million.</p>
      <p>A BDO spokesman said: “Our tax specialists have been negotiating with HMRC over the size of the tax bill.</p>
      <p>"There is no final decision, negotiations are ongoing, and we expect a resolution of this in 2020.”</p>
      <p>Sam Packer, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: “Many people have themselves been on the receiving end of unnecessary and intrusive HMRC blunders.</p>
      <p>"When you’re talking about millions of pounds, the taxman has to be extra careful not to get his maths wrong.”</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the tax authority said: “HMRC has always been clear that disguised remuneration is a form of tax avoidance.”</p>
