      <p>(CNN) - A<a href="https://cnn.com/style/article/banksy-at-work-photos-scli-intl/index.html"> Banksy</a> artwork of a young refugee in a lifejacket is partially submerged in <a href="https://cnn.com/2019/11/13/europe/venice-flooding-state-of-emergency-intl-hnk/index.html">Venice's worst floods in 50 years</a> -- as the city faces rising water levels on Friday and growing concerns over the extent of cultural damage.</p>
      <p>Photographs show the mural near Campo Santa Margherita, which depicts a child with a bright pink flare, mostly under water.</p>
      <p>The artwork was discovered earlier this year and was recognized as a Bansky after the street artist posted a picture of it on his official Instagram page in May.</p>
      <p>Antonio Renna, who lives near the artwork, took pictures of the Banksy mural on Tuesday evening when the water was at 160 cm (5 feet, 3 inches) almost up to the figure's shoulder. He told CNN that the currently the "water is at 153cm."</p>
      <p>Italian Minister of Cultural Heritage Dario Franceschini is meeting with local authorities on Friday and is assessing the damage the high tides have caused, a ministry spokesman told CNN.</p>
      <p>The spokesman added that the ministry has included St. Mark's Square, St Mark's Basilica and other historical buildings as areas of special concern. The tide reached 154 cm at 6:30a ET on Friday, officials said -- increasing disruption in a city already experiencing 70% closure.</p>
      <p>This comes as St Mark's Square was closed on Friday morning in the interest of public safety. Luigi Brugnaro, the Mayor of Venice who <a href="https://twitter.com/LuigiBrugnaro/status/1195256185399758848">tweeted earlier this week</a> that "Venice is on its knees", took to Twitter to share the news.</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/LuigiBrugnaro/status/1195237190512627713">another post</a>, he advised people to remain vigilant: "Another day of alert for Venice. The sirocco wind keeps blowing. I invite all ... to keep yourselves updated on the level of the water."</p>
      <p>To make matters worse, snowfall was expected in Belluno, a city in the eastern Dolomites, according to the Reuters news agency. This may further aggravate the situation in Venice.</p>
