      <h1>Could This Be The New Corvette Z06 Steering Wheel?</h1>
      <h2>Looks like the new Corvette Z06â€™s steering wheel will have lots of cabon fiber.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T14:35:55+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 14:35</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Bigg</a></address>
      <p>Just a few days ago, a sketch design emerged online that potentially gave us a <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/first-look-inside-the-new-corvette-z06">first look inside the new Corvette Z06</a>. Now, another photo has been posted online that, according to a post on <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/dvvtep/c8_z06_steering_wheel_leaked_on_facebook/">Reddit</a>, shows several Corvette steering wheels that are missing their airbags.</p>
      <p>The photo was originally posted on Facebook, but the source has not been identified. Look closely, and you can see a metal plaque at the bottom of each wheel displaying at least three characters, one of which says "Z." While this isn't definitive proof, this suggests we could be looking at the steering wheel from the new <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/chevrolet/corvette-z06">Corvette Z06</a>.</p>

      <p>Compared to the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/chevrolet/corvette">2020 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray</a>'s leather steering wheel, the Z06's steering wheel looks more premium, with carbon fiber adorning the top and bottom. It also shares some similarities with the sketch design, such as a red center line marker and what could be a Z06 badge positioned at the bottom, though the steering wheel depicted in the sketch wasn't finished in carbon fiber.</p>
      <p>In the sketch, the instrument cluster also showed the Mugello Circuit in Italy, and an ARM mode, while the cabin featured extensive use of carbon fiber.</p>

      <p>Under the hood, the new Z06 is expected to be powered by a twin-turbo V8 based on the Blackwing engine with an output of over 800 horsepower and 700 lb-ft of torque. This will be a significant improvement over the C7 Z06, which delivers 650 hp and 650 lb-ft of torque, and much more powerful than the entry-level Corvette Stingray, which has a 6.2-liter V8 producing 490 hp and 465 lb-ft of torque. With the Z51 package installed, the Stingray sprints from 0-62 mph in just 2.9 seconds.</p>
      <p>It's going to be an arduously long wait, however, as the new Z06 isn't expected to arrive until 2022. In the meantime, the production of the 2020 Corvette Stingray will <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/official-2020-chevrolet-corvette-stingray-delayed-by-several-months">start in February 2020 following a delay</a>.</p>
