      <p>(CNN) - A French tourist has died after falling from a waterfall in <a href="https://cnn.com/specials/asia/thailand-topics">Thailand</a> while attempting to take a <a href="https://cnn.com/2019/04/17/opinions/selfie-death-opinion-filipovic/index.html">selfie.</a></p>
      <p>The 33-year-old man died on Thursday after he slipped and fell from the Na Mueang 2 waterfall on the Thai island of Koh Samui -- the same spot where a Spanish tourist died in a fall in July, the AFP news agency reported.</p>
      <p>"His friend said he was trying to take a selfie and then he slipped and fell," Lieutenant Phuvadol Viriyavarangkul of the island's tourist police told AFP.</p>
      <p>Viriyavarangkul told the news agency that the spot is roped off and there is a sign warning tourists of the danger.</p>
      <p>CNN has contacted the French Foreign Ministry for comment on the incident.</p>
      <p>Some 259 people worldwide <a href="https://cnn.com/2018/10/03/health/selfie-deaths-trnd/index.html">died while taking selfies</a> from October 2011 to November 2017, according to a study published in India's Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care.</p>
      <p>According to the study, the most selfie deaths occurred in India, followed by Russia, the US and Pakistan. Most of the victims were men (about 72%) and under the age of 30.</p>
      <p>In October, four members of the same family <a href="https://cnn.com/2019/10/08/asia/selfie-deaths-india-dam-scli-intl/index.html">drowned at a dam</a> in India after slipping into the water while trying to take a selfie.</p>
