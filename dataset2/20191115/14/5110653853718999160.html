      <h1>Google Stadia release date, games, price and more you need to know for launch</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T14:15:22+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 14:15</time> by <a rel="author">Jordan Heck</a></address>
      <p>Google is entering the gaming world with itscloud gaming service Stadia later this month.</p>
      <p>Stadia is different from other consoles like the Xbox One or Playstation 4 because it focuses solely on cloud gaming. With the Xbox and Playstation you'll need to either purchase a disc or download the game to your console. With Stadia, you're streaming the game much like you would a Netflix show. The game lives on a server rather than within your machine or a disc.</p>
      <p>Because Stadia is focusing on cloud gaming, you can play pretty much anywhere:laptops, PCs with a Chrome browser, Pixel phones, or a TV with an HDMI port where you can plug in yourChromecast Ultra dongle.</p>
      <h3>Google Stadia release date</h3>
      <p>Google Stadia will release on <b>November 19, 2019</b>.</p>
      <p>People who were early on the Stadia train were able to pre-order theFounder’s Edition, which includeda Night Blue Stadia Controller ($69 separately), aGoogle Chromecast Ultra($69 separately), 3 months of Stadia Pro and a 3-month buddy pass for giving Pro access to a friend.</p>
      <p>But those sold out quickly.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Gamers can instead get the Premiere Edition, which includesa Chromecast Ultra, a Clearly White controller and 3 months of Stadia Pro. Essentially the same as a Founder's package, but you won't get smaller perks like getting a Founder's Badge on your account, early access to a Stadia username of your choice and the ability to gift Stadia Pro to a friend.</p>

      <p>These games are expected to be available at some point before the end of 2019.</p>
      <h3>Is Madden 20 or FIFA 20 on Google Stadia?</h3>
      <p>Madden 20 and FIFA 20 are not currently projected to be on Google Stadia. Both games are developed by EA Sports which is under the broader developer Electronic Arts. When Google Stadia was first announced, Electronic Arts was listed as one of the publishers expected to provide games.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://images.daznservices.com/di/library/sporting_news/d5/8b/electronic-arts-google-stadia-ftr_5dpusf3vwtpw1ijqf96tiqnaz.png?t=1785069838&amp;w=%7Bwidth%7D&amp;quality=80"/>
        <figcaption>Google Stadia publishers</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>But Electronic Arts currently does not have any games projected to be on Stadia's platform. In fact, EA <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/ea-wants-you-to-help-test-out-its-stadia-rival-project-atlas">offered gamers to join</a> a rival to Stadia, a different game-streaming service called Project Atlas. However, it seems likely that EA will eventually allow games on the platform considering Google's reach.</p>
      <p>As of now, however, don't expect to be playing Madden or FIFA at launch or before 2019.</p>

      <p>Stadia Pro will be available at launch while Stadia Base won't be available until 2020 (release date unknown). A big difference between the two is the act of buying games. With Stadia Pro you'll get access to free games in the Stadia library (starting with Destiny 2 at launch) and you'll also get discounts on select games. However, you'll also be paying $9.99 a month to get those features.</p>
      <p>A smaller difference is the quality as Stadia Pro has better resolution (4K) and sound (Surround).</p>
      <p>It's also worth noting that while Google Stadia often gets compared to Netflix, you'll still need to purchase games like you would on Xbox or Playstation. The games won't just be available for free like a Netflix show or movie. Some games definitely will be free, but big-name games will likely cost you.</p>
      <h3>Google Stadia price, controllers</h3>
      <p><b>Premiere Edition:</b> $129</p>
      <p>The Premiere Edition gives you everything you need in order to run Google Stadia. This includes a Chromecast Ultra, a controller and 3 months of Stadia Pro. You can purchase extra controllers for $69. Google offers three different colors: Clearly White, Just Black and Wasabi.</p>

      <h3>Google Stadia latest news</h3>
      <p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Stadia/comments/dvv3tv/hi_reddit_andrey_from_the_stadia_team_here_and_im/">Reddit AMA</a>, Google employeesAndrey Doronichev and Beri Lee revealed some features (Stream Connect, State Share, Crowd Play) won't be available at launch. These features were all based around multiplayer experiences. According to the AMAStream Connect may arrive before the end of 2019, but State Share and Crowd Play won't be up until 2020.</p>
      <p>"Our approach to releasing features on Stadia is similar to how we run Google Search, YouTube, and other Google services: gradual rollout and continuous improvement, based on your feedback," Doronichev said. "We always start with nailing the key user-journey and then proceed with releasing extra features. YouTube started with 'watch video.' For Stadia it's 'Play the Game on your biggest screen.' New features will start popping as soon as one week after launch. I expect the first game with Stream Connect to launch by the end of the year. The games that support State Share and Crowd Play will be released next year. And of course, there are many more cool new platform features on the roadmap. We're aiming to release new stuff weekly after 11/19."</p>
