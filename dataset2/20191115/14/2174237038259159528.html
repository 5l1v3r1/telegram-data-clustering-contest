      <p>After rumours began circulating earlier this month that <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/every-tool-album-and-one-ep-ranked-from-worst-to-best">Tool</a> would return to Australia and New Zealand, the band have finally confirmed it’s happening.</p>
      <p>Fresh from releasing the acclaimed and long-awaited studio album <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/reviews/tools-fear-inoculum-intricate-immersive-and-thrillingly-warped"><i>Fear Inoculum</i></a> – their first album in 13 years – Tool have announced they’ll be heading to both countries in February 2020 for a number of dates. </p>
      <p>Tickets go on general sale next Friday (November 22), with pre-sale tickets opening for people who sign up in advance on November 20 at 2pm local time.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, the band revealed they’d be expanding their US tour, which runs through to February 1, as well as <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/tool-expand-fear-inoculum-with-new-book-edition">releasing a book edition of <i>Fear Inoculum</i> which features artwork, 3D visual cards and a downloadable video experience</a>. </p>
      <p>This year has proved to be Tool’s year. In August, the band broke Billboard’s chart record for having the longest song to enter the Billboard 100 with the title track from <i>Fear Inoculum</i>, which clocks in at 10 minutes and 21 seconds.</p>
      <p>They also made headlines when they <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/tools-fear-inoculum-dislodges-taylor-swift-from-top-of-the-charts">overthrew Taylor Swift’s <i>Lover</i> from the number one spot on the US Billboard 100</a>, with the follow-up to <i>10,000 Days</i> racking up 270,000 album units in its first week. </p>
