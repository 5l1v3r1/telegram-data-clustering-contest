      <h1>Hayley Kiyoko Makes Lovelorn Pop Sound So Damn Good</h1>

      <p>Hayley Kiyoko’s new single, “L.O.V.E. Me,” is best experienced when played at max volume in the comfort of your bedroom. The first few finger snaps are your cue to grab your favorite hairbrush and pose in front of your new Home Goods floor mirror with a huge dumb grin on your face. At least, that's the scene you would've found in <i>my</i> bedroom at the exact moment I heard the song, from Kiyoko’s forthcoming project <i>I’m Too Sensitive For This Shit,</i> for the first time.</p>
      <p>“L.O.V.E. Me” is an irresistible earworm driven by finger snaps and thick drums before a funky guitar comes forward in the chorus. Lesbian Jesus returns to her usual honest and vulnerable self and sends a very direct warning to the girl who has her heart: “I'm gonna kiss you/In front of everybody that wants to be your honey/If you have a problem, don't tell me you love me."Sonically, the song is a distant relative of previously-released singles “I Wish,” a dreamy, spellbinding bop about unrequited love, and “Demons,” on which the singer pleads for forgiveness from those she’s hurt.</p>
      <p>While themes of love, attraction, and heartbreak are woven throughout her catalog, Hayley admits she’s no love doctor. “I think that through experience and learning to love yourself, you realize that you will love many,” she explains to me over the phone. “But [“L.O.V.E. Me”] is about finding someone that's on the same page and is willing and able in their lives to give and receive the same.”</p>
      <p>Ahead, Kiyoko talks about “L.O.V.E Me,” her upcoming project, and why being sensitive isn’t a bad thing.</p>
      <p>The Spice Girls may come to mind at first listen, but Hayley Kiyoko was inspired by the "weird" sounds of Gorillaz and Weezer.</p>
      <p>When we were producing it and writing the song, we didn't say, 'Oh, it should be like this or it should be like that.' The beat started and we started putting weird sounds reminiscent of the Gorillaz and Weezer, all these great sounds I grew up with. We were inspired to put in weird, quirky sounds and ended up turning into this feel good, upbeat, flirty track. "L.O.V.E. Me" is literally one of my favorite songs on the album.</p>

      <p>Hayley tends to wear her heart on her sleeve, and wrote "L.O.V.E. Me" based on her own history with love.</p>
      <p>I have these very overwhelming feelings that when I'm happy, I am happy, when I'm sad, I'm sad, and when I'm in love, I'm <i>really </i>in love. I didn't have a song that kind of represented that feeling where I'm feeling one extreme and it's like, "This is how I feel, but like, do you feel the same way? Will you be able to be on the same level as I am?" Also, this was me admitting through the lyrics in a confident way that, "Yeah, I have issues and yeah, I'm not perfect, but will you love me back?" A lot of times in my past relationships and my past experiences with girls, I was always on a completely different page, wanting them to be where I was, and it was never going to work out that way. I caused a lot of strain on my heart and went through a lot of heartbreaks and tears to realize that just like anything, nobody can change who I am and I can't change where someone else was in their life.</p>
      <p>Spoiler Alert:<i> I'm Too Sensitive for This Shit</i> is really upbeat<i>.</i></p>
      <p>Because I'm very much a "jump all in" person, I jumped all in to <i>Expectations</i> last year and I didn't know what it was going to be, but then it turned into something beautiful. When we were approaching writing this project, I knew exactly how it was going to sound. I knew there would be moody, it's going to be aggressive, it's going to have emotion, but everything's going to be really upbeat and feel good even if the lyrics are super honest and real.</p>

      <p>Social media makes it easy to seem "savage" or have a cold heart, but Hayley finds the beauty in being sensitive.</p>
      <p>I'm definitely not a savage. I was literally born with sensitive written all over my body, so I feel like this project screams who I am from A to Z. That's why I wanted to put out a project called <i>I'm Too Sensitive For This Shit</i>. This project forced me to be unapologetically confident in those vulnerabilities and feelings.</p>
      <p>When it comes to me and relationships, I've always dealt with wanting to shout my love from the rooftops and falling head over heels, really going all or nothing, because I'm very black and white as far as my emotions go. But then, at the same time, the song is about embracing the fact that none of us are perfect and we all have issues, but let's love each other through it. As you continue to listen through every song on the project, you'll notice that they all really tackle a certain mission, but they tackle it how I tackle everyday life, which is very black and white. Hopefully listeners and my fans will understand that and just…feel.</p>
