      <h1>Bella Hadid Opens Up About Battle With Depression: ‘I Would Cry Every Single Morning’</h1>

      <p>Bella Hadid opened up about her mental health battle and the pressures of being a runway model as she spoke at the Vogue Fashion Festival in Paris Friday.</p>
      <p>Hadid said there were times when she’d “cry every single morning” just as her career really started to take off.</p>
      <p>She explained, according to <i><a href="https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/bella-hadid-never-felt-powerful-in-victorias-secret-shows-1203371806/">WWD</a></i>: “For a while I just didn’t want to talk about it, and I’ve gone through a lot in the past few years with my health. I feel guilty for being able to live this incredible life, have the opportunities that I do, but somehow still be depressed. It doesn’t make sense.”</p>
      <p>“I would cry every single morning, I would cry during my lunch breaks, I would cry before I slept. I was very emotionally unstable for a while when I was working 14-hour days for four months straight as an 18-year-old. I think I just wanted to breathe a little bit. And so it kind of put me in a spiral.”</p>

      <p>Hadid, who has walked the Victoria’s Secret show a few times, also said the first time she actually felt comfortable modelling lingerie was during Rihanna’s Savage x Fenty show in September.</p>
      <p>Hadid, who donned a bright yellow underwear set for the show, shared: “Rihanna’s amazing. For me, that was the first time on a runway that I felt really sexy. Because when I first did Fenty, I was doing other lingerie shows and I never felt powerful on a runway, like, in my underwear.”</p>

      <p>“I like being another character. I think at this point I don’t necessarily love being myself sometimes. Sometimes on the runway you get either nervous or you forget how your legs move.”</p>
