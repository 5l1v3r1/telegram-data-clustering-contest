      <p>MUMBAI (Nov 15): India stocks advanced, with the benchmark index completing its third week of gains on investor expectation that lower borrowing costs will boost outlook for corporate profits.</p>
      <p>Global sentiment for riskier assets was also buoyed by renewed U.S.-China trade-deal prospects.</p>
      <p>The S&amp;P BSE Sensex advanced 0.2% to 40,356.69 in Mumbai, clocking its longest weekly winning streak since the end of September. The measure had climbed as much as 0.9% earlier in the session, before a late sell off.</p>
      <p>The NSE Nifty 50 Index added 0.2%. Most markets in Asia rose as optimism grew for Beijing and Washington to close an initial trade deal, with the MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbing 0.5%.</p>
      <p>Locally, earnings for companies were better than expected. Thirty-one of the Nifty 50 firms either met or exceeded analyst estimates, while results for six were incomparable, according to data compiled by <i>Bloomberg</i>. Investors in India yesterday shrugged off quickening inflation in the expectation that borrowing costs will continue to be eased.</p>

      <p>The Numbers</p>
      <p>Seven of 19 sector sub-indexes compiled by BSE Ltd advanced, led by a gauge of telecom companies.</p>
      <p>Telecom services providers surged, amid expectations government may provide moratorium to companies on the pending spectrum payments.</p>
      <p>Gauge of banking stocks added 0.9% after the Supreme Court allowed ArcelorMittal to acquire Essar Steel, and ruled that the steelmaker’s financial lenders get preference over operational creditors, such as suppliers.</p>
      <p>Fortis Healthcare Ltd plunged 7.9%, after the top court refused to remove a barrier for its takeover by Malaysian operator IHH Healthcare Bhd.</p>
