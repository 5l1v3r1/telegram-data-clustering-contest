      <p><b>WASHINGTONÂ (AP)</b> - President Donald Trump plans to attend a meeting of NATO leaders next month in London, where he will try to convince U.S. allies that they should increase defense spending.</p>
      <p>Trump has long pushed those allies to reduce their reliance on the United States for security assistance.</p>
      <p>White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham says that during the visit to London from Dec. 2 to Dec. 4, the president and first lady Melania Trump will attend a reception hosted by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace.</p>
      <p>Grisham says Trump will also stress NATO's readiness to respond to terrorist threats and cyberattacks that target infrastructure and telecommunications networks.</p>
