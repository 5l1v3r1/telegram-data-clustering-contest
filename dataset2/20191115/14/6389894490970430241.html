      <p>Boris Johnson unveiled his new election bus today during a campaign launch in Greater Manchester.</p>
      <p>The bus is emblazoned with the words: “Back Boris and vote Conservative to… Get Brexit Done.”</p>

      <p>Speaking to attendees, the Prime Minister said: “Some of you might ask why we need this bus, or even why we need this election.</p>
      <p>“The answer is because parliament is unfortunately paralysed. It is like blocked pipe, or like an anaconda that has swallowed a tapir, or like a blocked artery at the heart of the British body politic that is refusing to get Brexit done.”</p>

      <p>Just like the old saying goes, you wait ages for one Boris-related bus incident, and two come at once.</p>
      <p>Yesterday the public was treated to the utterly surreal sight of the Prime Minister joining in, albeit quite half-heartedly, with West Monkton school children for a rendition of the “Wheels on the Bus.”</p>
      <p>Twitter was unsurprisingly quick to respond.</p>

      <p>The Prime Minister will be hoping that this bus attracts less column inches than previous models.</p>
      <p>During the 2016 referendum campaign, Johnson’s Vote Leave bus was emblazoned with the now infamous claim that Britain would be £350m a week better off after leaving the EU.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The claim, which earned a rebuke from the chair of the UK Statistics Authority <a href="https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Letter-from-Sir-David-Norgrove-to-Foreign-Secretary.pdf">as “a clear misuse of official statistics”</a>, was seen by many as critical to the Leave victory.</p>
      <p>In May this year, a magistrate ruled that Johnson should face charges for the claim but that decision was overturned in June by the High Court, after judges concluded that the magistrate’s decision was flawed.</p>
