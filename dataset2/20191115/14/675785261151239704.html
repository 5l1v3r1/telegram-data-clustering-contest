      <h1>Jadon Sancho transfer fee 'set by Borussia Dortmund' amid Man Utd and Liverpool interest</h1>
      <h2>The England international has been heavily linked with a move to the Premier League over the summer</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T14:34:06+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 14:34</time> by <a rel="author">Hassan Rashed</a></address>
      <p>Borussia Dortmund have reportedly put a £120million (€140m) price tag on Jadon Sancho amid interest from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> .</p>
      <p>England star Sancho has emerged as one of the hottest properties in Europe after a breakout campaign in Germany last season and has been heavily linked with a move to the Premier League over the summer.</p>
      <p>Both Anfield and Old Trafford are considered potential destinations for the 19-year-old, who is reportedly open to leaving Dortmund after a difficult spell for Lucien Favre's side.</p>
      <p>And Dortmund are understood to be preparing for life without Sancho by identifying replacements after realising it will be tough to keep the forward beyond the end of the current season.</p>

      <p>However, <i>Bild</i> (via <a href="http://www.insidefutbol.com/2019/11/15/dortmund-identify-eye-watering-asking-price-for-liverpool-linked-jadon-sancho/443289/">InsideFutbol</a> ) claim that the Bundesliga club are determined to get the best price for the England international and have set a huge £120m asking price for the teenager.</p>
      <p>According to the German publication, Dortmund consider Sancho to be a bigger talent than Ousmane Dembele, who was sold to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> for an initial £96.8m fee in 2017.</p>
      <p>Despite enjoying a quick start to the season, which saw him score three goals in his first five Bundesliga games, Sancho has struggled to reach top gear for Dortmund in recent months.</p>
      <p>He has not found the target since netting at Eintracht Frankfurt for his club on September 22 and was substituted after just 36 minutes during the 4-0 defeat against Bayern Munich last weekend.</p>

      <p>The forward is currently on international duty with England and played all 90 minutes during Thursday's Euro 2020 qualifier against Montenegro.</p>
      <p>Sancho started the 7-0 win in the absence of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> winger Raheem Sterling, who was dropped for the match following his clash with Liverpool defender Joe Gomez.</p>
      <p>Gareth Southgate's side face Kosovo in their final qualifying game on Sunday, with only a draw needed to top Group A.</p>
