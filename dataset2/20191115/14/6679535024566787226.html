      <p>TIRUCHI</p>
      <p>Tamil Nadu Open University (TNOU) will, for the first time, be conducting induction programmes for the nearly 12,500 students admitted for 2019-20 academic year across its regional centres and learner support centres in the State, over the next two weeks.</p>
      <p>The induction programme, meant to orient learners on open university system, the exam system, the study materials, and internal assignments, and rectifying doubts about discrepancies, if any, will be conducted on Saturday at a learner support centre at Tiruppur under the Coimbatore Regional Centre and at Theni under the Madurai Regional Centre, TNOU Vice-Chancellor K. Parthasarathy said.</p>
      <p>Hitherto, the concept of TNOU's induction programme was confined only to B.Ed. course.</p>
      <p>Now that the system of private agencies managing study centres have been dispensed with, full-time regional directors will be coordinating with the learner support centres in their respective regions to make sure that the interface with the learners is strengthened, Prof. Parthasarathy said.</p>
      <p>In Tiruchi, the induction programme will take place at Jamal Mohamed College on November 23. On the same day, the programme will be conducted at Tirunelveli also. On November 24, the induction programme will take place at Kumbakonam, Tuticorin and Villupuram. At the Chennai centre where over 3,000 students have been enrolled, the induction programme will take place on November 30 and December 1, Prof. Parthasarathy said.</p>
      <p>Permanent faculties have been posted as regional directors at all the eight centres at Tiruchi, Coimbatore, Chennai, Villpuruam, Madurai, The Nilgiris, Tirunelveli, and Dharmapauri for better decentralisation to manage the cumulative student strength of about 40,000 students enrolled for the certificate, diploma, vocational diploma and PG diploma, besides the UG and PG programmes, the Vice-Chancellor said. The students of whom a majority constitute working professionals adding qualifications for career progression will be provided with the email ids and phone numbers of the regional directors for instant communication.</p>
      <p>TNOU is the first open university to have been approved by the University Grants Commission in 2016 to offer M.Phil and PhD programmes. The State Government's approval for the two programmes was accorded the subsequent year, he said.</p>
