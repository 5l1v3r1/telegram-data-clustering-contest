      <p>SkyCity union members striking this weekend after 50 workers fall ill due to smoke inhalation.</p>
      <p>SEA-Unite SkyCity workers are expected to strike this weekend after 50 called in sick with symptoms linked to smoke inhalation from the convention centre fire.</p>
      <p>“50 of our members have been ill as a direct result of inhaling smoke from the fire on October 22” said SEA-Unite union organiser Joe Carolan.</p>
      <p>“In the last few days air quality specialist have conformed that those exposed to the plume inhaled more than three years worth of cancer-causing chemicals in a single day. Our members, and customers, were kept inside the casino complex with the air conditioning sucking in the smoke and recirculating it for hours.”</p>
      <p>“SkyCity has been trying to say it was safe and there was little risk. Now we know.”</p>
      <p>Striking workers will be picketing at 7pm outside the SkyCity entrance on Federal St today.</p>
