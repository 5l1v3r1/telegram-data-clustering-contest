      <p>Speaking in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Louisiana">Louisiana</a> last night, the president complained the inquiry has been “very hard” on his family as he took to the stage to muster support for Republican gubernatorial candidate <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/eddie-rispone">Eddie Rispone</a>, the plea for sympathy a marked change of tactic.</p>
      <p>As security experts warn Mr Trump’s 26 July phone call with <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/gordon-sondland">Gordon Sondland</a>, ambassador to the EU, could have been picked up by Russian spies, the president is planning to take the battle to withhold his tax returns from investigators to the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/us-supreme-court">Supreme Court</a>.</p>

She's set to arrive on Capitol Hill momentarily. <br/> <br/>Stay tuned for more.<br/> </p>
