      <p>“I wrote Christmas Drag over a decade ago,” Dallon explains. “I’ve always been a sucker for Christmas music, and this was one of the first Christmas songs I ever wrote for myself. I’m happy I got a chance to give it a proper recording and release. Oh Noel was recorded in one take, on the first try. I recorded it with a fella named Stu Maxfield, who is this fantastic musician from Provo. After we did the first pass, the engineer asked us if we wanted another take. We looked at each other and said no at the same time. A pretty special studio moment.”</p>
