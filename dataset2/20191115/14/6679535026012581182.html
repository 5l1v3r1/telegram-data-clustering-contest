      <p>The Kozhikode Sessions Court on Friday remanded CPI(M) workers Alan Suhaib and Taha Fazal, booked for alleged Maoist links, to police custody till 11 a.m. on Monday.</p>
      <p>Sessions Judge M.R. Anitha order comes in the wake of a petition moved by the Public Prosecutor and government pleader K.N. Jayakumar that the police need to further question them in the case. The case pertained to the Kozhikode city police arresting them a fortnight ago for their alleged association with the banned CPI(Maoist).</p>
      <p>Both of them were produced in court after the custodial interrogation ended on Friday. While Alan, 20, was in police custody from Wednesday, Taha, 24, was permitted to be questioned only from Thursday. This was following his health condition.</p>
      <p>He was admitted to the Government General Hospital (Beach Hospital) following uneasiness a few days ago. However, the Kozhikode Medical College Hospital (MCH) attested his fitness.</p>
      <p>Investigators had already got clinching evidence, including materials and electronic devices, about their involvement with the functionaries of the proscribed outfit.</p>
      <p>The Sessions Court had already rejected their bail pleas last week after it was convinced that prima facie the duo had been associating themselves with the Maoist organisation with the intention to further its activities.</p>
      <p>Both had been charged under Sections 20 (punishment for being member of terrorist gang or organisation), 38 (offence relating to membership of a terrorist organisation) and 39 (offence relating to support given to a terrorist organisation) of the Unlawful Activities ( Prevention) Act.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile the Kerala High Court will consider their bail application on Monday.</p>
