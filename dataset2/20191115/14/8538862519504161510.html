      <p>Here's something that we wish more games would do: actually explain the differences of each difficulty level in detail. <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/star_wars_jedi_fallen_order">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a> takes a step in the right direction by breaking down several key gameplay elements that are altered depending on the difficulty level that you choose to play on.</p>

      <p>As you can see, the title's difficulty is broken down into three gameplay elements: Parry Timing, Incoming Damage, and Enemy Aggression. The higher the difficulty, the less time you have to parry attacks, and your opponents fight back with more vigour. While a lot of games do outline general gameplay differences between difficulties, few actually give you a visual indication of what to expect. It's ultimately a small touch, but we still think it's a refreshing approach.</p>
      <p>Would you like to see more games highlight exactly how gameplay is altered through different difficulty levels? Nail that parry timing in the comments section below.</p>
