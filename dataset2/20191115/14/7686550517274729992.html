      <p>Advent calendars usually house Christmas pictures, chocolates or even beauty items behind the doors but one calendar is offering something a little different this Christmas.</p>
      <p>A 12 days of Christmas wine advent calendar is on sale for those who enjoy a festive tipple.</p>
      <p>Deals website Wowcher has launched this 12 days of Christmas wine calendar with a huge reduction- which will be attracting plenty of shoppers we can imagine.</p>
      <p>With a selection of six wines including rose and white wines, it really does sound like a no brainer.</p>
      <p>And, when it is reduced from £68.99 to £31.99 shoppers will be clicking and buying quick.</p>
      <p>A total of six wine accessories are hidden behind the doors which include, a bottle opener, a bottle stopper, two Christmas bottle wraps, a wine cooler and a wine pourer.</p>
      <p>See the <a href="https://fave.co/2COj91S">deal here</a> and get it while you can.</p>
      <p>It is not the only wine advent calendar on the market though. Aldi has brought back its popular wine Advent calendar for 2019.</p>
      <p>The boozy countdown comes with 24 mini bottles of white, rose, red and sparkling wine.</p>
      <p>It has 24 doors and contains the equivalent of six bottles of wine.</p>
      <p>The budget supermarket's Advent has sold out online but is still available in selected stores.</p>
      <p>Other advent calendars launched for 2019 include <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink-news/alcohol-advent-calendars-christmas-2019-17235718">gin, beer and even Baileys.</a></p>
