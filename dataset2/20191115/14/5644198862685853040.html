      <p>Agus Wibowo, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency (BNPB), said two people sustained minor injuries in Ternate in the province of North Maluku, also known as the Moluccas, citing the local disaster mitigation agency. Six houses and two churches were also lightly damaged.</p>
      <p>"The local disaster mitigation agency in Ternate has also said that the people who were staying away from beaches started returning to their homes this morning," he said in a statement, adding that calm had returned to the city of Bitung on Sulawesi island and in the Halmahera district in the Moluccas.</p>
      <p>The quake had earlier caused panic among many residents, prompting them to flee to higher ground.</p>

      <p>Indonesia is situated on the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, which frequently has earthquakes and sometimes accompanying tsunamis.</p>
      <p>A magnitude 7.3 earthquake had struck the Moluccas in July, killing at least four people.</p>
      <p>The most devastating earthquake in recent Indonesian history was on Dec 26, 2004 when a magnitude 9.5 quake triggered a massive tsunami that killed around 226,000 people along the shorelines of the Indian Ocean, including more than 126,000 in Indonesia.</p>
