      <h2>Mickey joins Willie (87) on his scooter</h2>

      <p>One man and his dog make a wonderful pair in Errol, spending their later years together.</p>
      <p>Sprightly 87-year-old Willie Cairns was all alone after losing his wife a year ago, when his family helped him find a four-legged companion.</p>
      <p>Mickey the rescue dog is 16-years-old and was by far the oldest dog in almost 30 years of rehoming that PADS (Perthshire Abandoned Dogs Society) staff had through the kennels at Forteviot.</p>
      <p>But after Willie went to have a look there in May and Mickey met his eye, they formed an OAP - old aged pals - partnership.</p>
      <p>Alison Kennedy at PADS pointed out that if one human year is seven dog years, wee Mickey is 112.</p>
      <p>She added: “Add that to Willie’s 87 years and they have just one year short of 200 years between them.”</p>
      <p>Willie is waiting on a double hip replacement operation and is not as mobile right now as he would like to be.</p>
      <p>“My dad is a strong, fit man,” explained his daughter Carol Faulds. “Until he gets his op, he goes about on his scooter.</p>

      <p>“Mickey is happy to go for a walk, but on the way back he likes to hop up and ride along with Dad.”</p>
      <p>Carol described how when her mum died in November last year, her father was lost and they discussed getting a dog to keep him company at his home.</p>
      <p>“We agreed a young dog wouldn’t be suitable for him, so in the spring we kept an eye out for an older dog to adopt.</p>
      <p>“We’re a family of dog fanatics - I have a rescue spaniel, Jasper. My daughter Christine has two dogs - people know them round Perth, Tilly a St Bernard and Tally a rescued Newfoundland who came from Hungary - and so naturally, we contacted PADS.”</p>
      <p>Louise Perrett, the manager at PADS, said: “We got this little black terrier-type dog in and he was only with us for about six days - full of beans he was.</p>
      <p>“His owner had died and he was clearly quite elderly, although the vet found him in tip top health.</p>
      <p>“We were flabbergasted when we discovered he was 16, he still had plenty of go in him and we wanted to get him a new home.</p>

      <p>“His history was pretty amazing too - Mickey was born in Mexico. His previous owner was a nurse in the US who adopted him and when she retired, brought him to Scotland.</p>
      <p>“Very sadly she died and Mickey came to us.”</p>
      <p>Willie, a retired lorry driver, joked: “My pals who come out walking their dogs say we should try to speak Spanish to Mickey.</p>
      <p>“And to be honest, when I got him, I thought he might be deaf, but then I heard he belonged to an English lady, so perhaps he just couldn’t understand my accent. Now we understand each other fine.</p>
      <p>“I love Mickey. He’s a wee cracker, best dog in the world.”</p>
      <p>If you want to see if PADS has a friend for you, the kennels at Forteviot are open to the visiting public seven days a week.</p>
