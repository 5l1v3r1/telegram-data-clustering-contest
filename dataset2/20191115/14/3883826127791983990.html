        <b>The parents of a four-week-old baby who suffered a fractured skull, brain injuries and broken ribs have been charged with child cruelty offences.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Amanda Fulton, 31, and her husband Christopher Fulton, 30, are charged over alleged offences on 7 November.</p>
      <p>The court heard the baby is thought to have long-term brain injuries and be blind in both eyes.</p>
      <p>The couple, from Rockfield Gardens, Mosside, County Antrim, face the same four charges.</p>
      <p>They are accused of grievous bodily harm with intent, two counts of child cruelty involving two different children and causing or allowing a child to suffer serious physical harm.</p>
      <p>The couple appeared at Coleraine Magistrates' Court on Monday to face the charges but a press ban prevented proceedings from being reported.</p>
      <h3>Injuries to another child</h3>
      <p>The ban was lifted at the court on Friday by a district judge.</p>
      <p>A police officer told the court the baby was taken to a GP on 7 November before being rushed to hospital in an ambulance.</p>
      <p>The infant was found to have a fractured skull, a bleed on the brain, a laceration to its liver and broken ribs.</p>
      <p>The court heard the baby had now been taken off life support and was able to breathe for itself, but was thought to have long-term brain injuries.</p>
      <p>On further investigation, another of the couple's children was found to have discolouration on the back of their skull and ear.</p>

      <p>A police officer told the court the couple could not explain the injuries to their children, but accepted they had not been in the care of anyone else.</p>
      <p>The officer said a medical expert believed the injuries to the baby were "non-accidental" and had not been caused during birth.</p>
      <p>The officer said the fact some of the infant's rib fractures were healing led the medical expert to believe this was "not one isolated incident".</p>
      <p>The police officer also told the court that a death threat, believed to be from a loyalist paramilitary group, has been issued against the couple threatening them if they leave prison.</p>
      <h3>'Vilified'</h3>
      <p>The officer said there were "high tensions" in the Mosside area because of the case.</p>
      <p>A defence barrister said the Fultons were "living every parent's worst nightmare".</p>
      <p>He told the court threats had been made against the couple in Hydebank and Maghaberry prisons, where they are currently on remand.</p>
      <p>The barrister also showed the court threats that had been made on social media against his clients.</p>
      <p>On Monday, in court, the barrister said his clients had been "vilified" due to press coverage of the case and added they were entitled to the presumption of innocence.</p>
      <p>He told the court the alleged baby victim had been born prematurely and weighed five pounds at birth.</p>
      <p>Police objected to a bail application on the grounds of the risk of further offending, interference with witnesses and tensions in the Mosside area.</p>
      <p>Bail was refused and the couple were remanded in custody.</p>
