      <p>Turkey has sent more than 6,000 Syrian migrants in Istanbul to temporary housing centres in other provinces since early July, the local governor's office said on Friday, two weeks after a deadline for Syrians not registered in the city to leave.<br/><br/>Authorities had given Syrians not registered in Istanbul until Oct. 30 to move to another province or face forced removal from the city, Reuters reported.<br/><br/>Turkey hosts more than 3.6 million Syrians, the largest population of Syrians displaced by an eight-year civil war.<br/><br/>The number of Syrians in Istanbul, a city of some 15 million, has swelled to more than half a million.<br/><br/>The Istanbul governor's office said 6,416 unregistered Syrians were removed from Istanbul since July 12.<br/><br/>According to Reuters, sentiment towards Syrian refugees in Turkey has soured in recent years. Ankara wants to settle part of them in a swathe of land it now controls in northeast Syria, after it launched an offensive last month against the Kurdish YPG.<br/><br/>Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch last month published reports saying Turkey is forcibly sending Syrian refugees to northern Syria. <br/><br/>However, Turkey's Foreign Ministry called the claims in the reports "false and imaginary."<br/><br/>The governor's office also said it had sent 42,888 illegal migrants to provinces that have repatriation centres, adding that their deportation process is continuing in those centres.</p>
