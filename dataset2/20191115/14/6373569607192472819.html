      <h1>First look at the Barbican's posh new bar that was once the Notte Inn</h1>
      <h2>Owner Zena Bateman has transformed the building top to bottom, and re-opened as a stylish yet traditional pub with a twist</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T14:21:13+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 14:21</time> by <a rel="author">Jess Morcom</a></address>
      <p>Plymouth's prominent Notte Inn has finally re-opened with a new owner, a new look, a new menu and a new name - 1620.</p>
      <p>Owner Zena Bateman has injected a significant amount into completely revamping the building top to bottom and the bright and quirky decor looks fantastic.</p>
      <p>1620 is now open as Plymouth's new premiere pub and eatery, offering traditional pub food with a modern twist, and of course, plenty of alcohol.</p>
      <p>"We're essentially a traditional British pub," Zena told Plymouth Live.</p>
      <p>"We've got everything that you'd expect to see on a pub menu, craft ales, lagers, and champagnes and wines, and we're going to release a spritz menu very soon, along with old fashioned snowballs for the Christmas period.</p>

      <p>"The food menu is also lots of traditional dishes, but with a twist, so every dish will be somewhat elevated."</p>
      <p>Running her own pub/eatery has been a dream of Zena's for many years, and she has put her all into the transformation.</p>
      <p>"I was in catering decades ago, and I went to college and started training in catering and hospitality, so I've always had a passion for the industry," she said.</p>
      <p>"Then, I went into the property world and I almost purchased somewhere ten years ago, but that didn't work out so then plans were on a back burner for a bit. Meanwhile, I did my chefs course too to have an understanding of what goes on in the kitchen.</p>

      <p>"I've had my eye on this place for a while, it was somewhere that I always identified that I'd love to buy due to the amazing location.</p>
      <p>"A few years later, it came on the market, and I finally bought it and completed on it at the beginning of this year.</p>
      <p>"I've spent the past nine months refurbishing it, which is really exciting. We've just opened, so we are still getting to grips with everything, our market and who's walking through the doors."</p>

      <p>There are lots of nods of quirkiness around the place that make 1620 more than just your average pub, with each fitting in with a Great British theme.</p>
      <p>Decorative golden syrup cans of flowers are the centrepieces on each table, as well as a real telephone box door. There's also a 'doggy corner', with the pub being one of very few in Plymouth that welcome dogs.</p>
      <p>"Customers are welcome to come in for anything, whether its a bite to eat or just a few drinks," Zena added.</p>
      <p>"We are passionate about our food and are hoping to push the menu as much as we can, but equally we've had a weekend where there's been lots of people in here just drinking and we've had a fantastic time."</p>

      <p>"I feel very lucky, because I've got a great team of staff behind me. Debbie will be heading up the bar team, and she has lots of previous experience.</p>
      <p>"We've got all kinds of staff members from students, to people wanting a career change back into hospitality.</p>
      <p>"We also have a great team in the kitchen with collectively 100 years experience between them too. It's nice that everyone wants to be a part of 1620 from its birth and be on board with the business from the start."</p>
      <p>1620 is currently open Wednesday to Sunday with varied opening hours. You can find them at 60 Notte Street, PL1 2AG.</p>
