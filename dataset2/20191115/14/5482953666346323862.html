        <b>The Critics</b>
      </p>
      <p>“Visitors were spending time with sculpture that, despite—or because of—its enigmatic zaniness, inspired a slow look,” Holland Carter writes of a particularly crowded gallery in Rachel Harrison’s survey at the Whitney Museum in New York. [<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/arts/design/rachel-harrison-review-whitney-museum.html">The New York Times</a>]</p>
      <p>Photographer Nan Goldin’s first U.K. exhibition in 20 years is currently on view at Marian Goodman Gallery in London. “All her work, I think, is a kind of memoir, an insistent retelling of the same things over and again in different ways—because that is all that can be done,” Adrian Searle writes.

      <p>Here’s a Q&amp;A with Calvin Marcus, who lives and works in a defunct Baptist church in Los Angeles.

      <p>“Films like <i>SG̲aawaay Ḵ’uuna</i> transport indigenous traditions from set to community with surprising speed,” Julian Brave NoiseCat writes in a piece that takes up the question, “Can film save indigenous languages?” [<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/can-film-save-indigenous-languages">The New Yorker</a>]</p>
