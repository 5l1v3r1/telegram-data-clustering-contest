      <h1>Dow crosses 28,000 for first time on China trade deal hopes</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T14:54:30+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 14:54</time> by <a rel="author">Noah Manskar</a></address>
      <p>The Dow Jones industrial average crossed the 28,000 mark for the first time on Friday, boosted by reports that the US and China are nearing a trade deal.</p>
      <p>The blue-chip index closed at an all-time high of 28,004.89 after White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the US and China were “getting close” on a trade pact.</p>
      <p>“It’s not done yet, but there has been very good progress and the talks have been very constructive,” Kudlow said Thursday, according to Reuters.</p>
      <p>The Nasdaq rose 0.7 percent to close at a record 8,540.83. The S&amp;P 500 also closed at a record high of 3,120.46. up 0.8 percent.</p>
      <p>Kudlow’s latest comments offered some clarity about just how close the Trump administration is to a deal with Beijing, said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.</p>
      <p>Kudlow reportedly said US and Chinese officials are communicating daily as the talks come down to the “short strokes,” with the caveat that Trump “hasn’t signed off on a commitment for phase one.”</p>
      <p>“For the market you want more definition of what ‘close’ means, and Larry Kudlow seemed to help with that definition,” Krosby told The Post.</p>
      <p>With more tariffs looming next month, the markets are following every word of the China talks now that other economic concerns have been quelled, according to analysts.</p>
      <p>Markets are especially sensitive to developments on the Chinese trade front with the corporate earnings season all but over, said Donald Selkin, chief market strategist for Newbridge Securities.</p>
      <p>Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s testimony to Congress this week also seemed to assuage concerns about a possible recession, Selkin said. Powell told lawmakers Wednesday that he sees a “sustained expansion of economic activity” ahead.</p>
      <p>“The only thing that the market really is concentrating now on is the news or lack of news from China,” Selkin told The Post.</p>
      <p>Trump himself said a trade deal was “close” in a Tuesday speech to the Economic Club of New York. But the last pieces of the deal could be the hardest to hammer out, Krosby said.</p>
      <p>“What seems like ‘Sign here, sign there’ are sometimes the most difficult,” Krosby said.</p>
