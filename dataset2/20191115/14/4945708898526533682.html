      <h1>An Apple bundle with Apple TV+, music and news may be on the way</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T14:59:20+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 14:59</time> by <a rel="author">Rex Crum, The Mercury News</a></address>
      <p>With its new Apple TV+ streaming service just getting off the ground, and fresh competition coming from this week's debut of Disney+, Apple is reportedly considering selling a bundled package that would include its new TV offering and other subscription services.</p>
      <p>Apple, which launched Apple TV+ on Nov. 1, is said to be looking at including the streaming TV <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/service/">service</a>, Apple Music and its Apple News+ service in a bundle as part of its effort to build up its services business, which is the company's second-largest source of revenue. According to a report from Bloomberg, "people familiar with the matter" said the bundled offering could be available in early 2020.</p>
      <p>For Apple, subscription services have taken on greater importance as sales of iPhones have begun to decline. During its fiscal fourth-quarter, which ended in September, Apple said iPhone revenue declined by more than 9% from a year ago, to $33.4 billion. However, services sales climbed by 18%, to $12.5 billion.</p>
      <p>As part of its effort to build its Apple TV+ subscriber base, Apple is charging just $4.99 a month for the service, and also offering a free year's-worth of Apple TV+ to customers who buy a new iPhone or other hardware products.</p>
      <p>An Apple spokesperson said the company had no comment on the matter.</p>
      <p>Should Apple offer a bundle of subscription services, it would be taking a page from Disney. In addition to offering Disney+ for $6.99 a month, or $69.99 for an entire year, Disney is also bundling Disney+ in a package with Hulu and ESPN+ for $12.99 a month.</p>
      <p>If it wants to compete and lure new customers, Apple could end up having to make some price adjustments to any bundle it might offer. In addition to the $4.99 a month it charges for Apple TV+, the company also charges $9.99 a month each for Apple Music and Apple News+.</p>
      <p>Disney also sought to show how popular Disney+ was right out of the gate when on Wednesday it said it signed up 10 million Disney+ subscribers on Nov. 12, the day the service went live. Apple doesn't disclose subscriber numbers for its various services.</p>
