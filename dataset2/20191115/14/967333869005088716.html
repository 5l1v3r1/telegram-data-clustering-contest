      <p>According to BGNES, a Bulgarian government Falcon with Prime Minister Boyko Borisov had to perform an emergency landing in the capital city of Sofia.</p>
      <p>The landing gear broke down during the first attempt to land, so the plane's pilot had to attempt a manual landing. Fortunately, the incident resulted in no casualties, and Borisov managed to reach his destination safely.</p>
