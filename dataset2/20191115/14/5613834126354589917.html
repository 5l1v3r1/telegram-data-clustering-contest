      <p>A very special episode of the podcast <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/post-mortem-with-mick-garris/id1204949508?mt=2"><b>Post Mortem with Mick Garris</b></a> is on the way next week, as Garris sits down for a chat with the only other living filmmaker to adapt Stephen King’s<b><i> The Shining </i></b>novels, “The Haunting of Hill House” and <b><i>Doctor Sleep</i></b> director <b>Mike Flanagan</b>.</p>
      <p>Garris directed the TV mini-series adaptation of Stephen King’s <i>The Shining</i> two decades before Flanagan entered the Overlook, so needless to say, the two have a ton to talk about.</p>
      <p>Producer Joe Russo teased to us this week, “<i>[Mike and Mick] talk very candidly about Stanley Kubrick, the Shining mini-series and Doctor Sleep</i>.” The episode will be available <b>November 20</b>.</p>
      <p>Post Mortem, which releases a new episode every other week as part of the Fangoria Podcast Network, “dives deep into the minds of the greatest filmmakers and creators of your worst nightmares to bring their distinctive visions to life in fascinating one-on-one conversations.”</p>
