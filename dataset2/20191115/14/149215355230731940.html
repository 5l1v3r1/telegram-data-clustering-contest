      <p>President Trump lashed out at House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and complained that the impeachment inquiry has been hard on his family at a wild Louisiana rally Thursday night.</p>
      <p>Trump spoke after the first two witnesses spoke publicly in the impeachment inquiry on Wednesday, <a href="https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1195155931509772288">decrying</a> the "deranged impeachment witch hunt" and telling supporters that impeachment has been "very hard on my family."</p>
      <p>"Impeachment to me is a dirty word," <a href="https://twitter.com/WFLA/status/1195296330744303616">he added</a>. "It's been very unfair, very hard on my family. My whole life is crazy."</p>
      <p>Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1195156399065575424">dismissed Wednesday's witnesses</a> as "Never Trumpers," a charge they specifically denied. He also targeted Schiff, the committee's top Democrat, with fresh personal insults, mocking his "little 10-inch neck" and doing an impression of Schiff buying a shirt. “What size shirts do you need, Adam,” Trump asked to himself. “I wear a size nine," he responded as Schiff. "Nine! He will not make the LSU football team, that I can tell you."</p>
      <p>At another point in the rally, Trump re-upped his call for <a href="https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1195158149826850817">Schiff to be prosecuted</a> while providing no examples of anything illegal he's done, centering his complaint around the Democrat's paraphrase of his Ukraine call. The impeachment inquiry, meanwhile, on Friday is continuing with its second day of public hearings. Brendan Morrow</p>
