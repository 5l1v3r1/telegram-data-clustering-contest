      <h2>NASA has revealed new findings about two of Neptune’s moons, and how they must ‘dance’ to avoid smashing into each other</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T14:40:30+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 14:40</time> by <a rel="author">Shivali Best, https://www.facebook.com/shivalibestjournalist/</a></address>
      <p>At more than 2.7 million miles away, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/space">Neptune </a>is the further planet from Earth in our solar system, meaning it’s one of the least explored worlds.</p>
      <p>Now, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/nasa">NASA </a>has revealed new findings about two of Neptune’s moons, and how they must ‘dance’ to avoid smashing into each other.</p>
      <p>The moons, called Naiad and Thalass, orbit just 1,150 miles apart, but have perfectly co-ordinated orbits, which mean that as they pass each other, they’re about 2,200 miles apart.</p>
      <p>In this cosmic dance, Naiad swirls around Neptune every seven hours, while Thalassa takes the outside track, and takes 7.5 hours to orbit the planet.</p>
      <p>Naiad’s orbit follows a bizarre zigzag pattern, which NASA has never seen before.</p>

      <p>Marina Brozovic, who led the study, explained: “We refer to this repeating pattern as a resonance. There are many different types of 'dances' that planets, moons and asteroids can follow, but this one has never been seen before."</p>
      <p>Naiad and Thalass aren’t alone - they’re actually two of 14 moons that orbit Neptune.</p>
      <p>Neso, the farthest-flung of them, orbits in a wildly elliptical loop that carries it nearly 46 million miles away from Neptune and takes 27 years to complete!</p>

      <p>The researchers believe that Naiad and Thalassa got their strange orbits thanks to Triton, Neptune’s giant moon.</p>
      <p>Dr Brozovic added: “We suspect that Naiad was kicked into its tilted orbit by an earlier interaction with one of Neptune's other inner moons.</p>
      <p>“Only later, after its orbital tilt was established, could Naiad settle into this unusual resonance with Thalassa."</p>
