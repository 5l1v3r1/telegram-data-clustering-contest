      <p>DRUGS with a street value of €491,000 have been seized in 134 searches in Mayo so far this year.</p>
      <p>Gardaí have conducted 320 searches, with drugs with a potential street value of €359,000 found for sale or supply, a further €2,000 worth being cultivated, while the remaining drugs seized were for personal use.</p>
      <p>Gardaí in Mayo have made 104 detections of drugs for personal use this year, Chief Supt. Pat Diskin informed a meeting of the Mayo policing forum. Twenty-seven seizures concerned sale or supply.</p>
      <p>The total value of the drugs seized - €491,000 – is up from last year's figure of €234,000.</p>
      <p>The number of seizures is down on 2018 but the value is higher.</p>
      <p>Responding to councillors' questions, Chief Supt. Diskin said the quantities of drugs seized this year is a worrying trend.</p>
      <p>Cocaine being more available appears to be the trend.</p>
      <p>In an update on crime in the division, the chief supt. said drink driving detections have remained around the same level this year, with 170 detections so far, for drink or drugs. Of those, 31 motorists were under the influence of drugs – up 16 on this time last year.</p>
      <p>Councillor Christy Hyland said we have an epidemic of cocaine and he highlighted an 'excellent' investigation in Westport recently where €40,000 worth of the drug was found.</p>
      <p>“That was for our market. For the young people in my area and County Mayo,” he commented, adding that we would lose a generation if we don't tackle and put resources into the drugs issue.</p>
      <p>Heroin, too, he said was found in the county in recent weeks, a drug that is crime related.</p>
      <p>Councillor Hyland also called for more gardaí on the beat.</p>
      <p>Councillor Michael Burke highlighted the value of CCTV in his town, Ballinrobe, since it was installed in 2011. Since then the community had put in about €40,000, but the authorities had to take a bigger responsibility and not ask a community to sustain it.</p>
