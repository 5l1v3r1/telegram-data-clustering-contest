      <h1>SiR Reflects On Inglewood Inspiring His Music In 'Silly For The Westside' Short Film</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T14:55:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 14:55</time> by <a rel="author">Yohance Kyles (@HUEYmixwitRILEY)</a></address>
      <p>The TDE performer takes viewers to his stomping grounds in support of Amazon Music’s R&amp;B Rotation playlist.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News) </b><i>Chasing Summer</i>, the third studio album from SiR, arrived on August 30. Kendrick Lamar, Lil Wayne, Jill Scott, Smino, Kadhja Bonet, Sabrina Claudio, and Zacari are guests on the project.</p>
      <p>Before 2019 closes out, SiR took Amazon Music back to his hometown of Inglewood, California. The <i>Silly For The Westside</i> short film focuses on the singer's love for the city, how it’s changing, and how it inspired his music.</p>
      <p>“Where I grew up, it doesn’t look like ‘the hood’ that people think Inglewood is. And it’s not. The beautiful homes. Trees. The smell. You can almost smell the beach. Fresh," says the Top Dawg Entertainment signee.</p>
      <p>He added, "And even with Compton and Watts. Those places, they’re beautiful. There’s just tons of churches and congregations that make up a whole different side of the city that nobody really sees."</p>
      <p>Any discussion about urban America in the 2010s usually involves a conversation about gentrification. SoFi Stadium, the future home of the Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Chargers, is being built in Inglewood, and there are concerns about the estimated $5 billion venue driving up housing costs for the residents of the neighborhood.</p>
      <p>“During the time when they were first starting the development of the stadium, I remember hearing the first explosion where they were tearing down the old Hollywood Park Casino. I can’t tell if it’s a good thing or a bad thing yet. But there’s no place like home," expresses SiR in <i>Silly For The Westside.</i></p>
