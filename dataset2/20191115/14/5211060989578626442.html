      <p>The case of a woman accused of throwing a chair off a downtown Toronto high-rise balcony is expected to return to court this morning.</p>
      <p>The February incident, which was caught on camera and shared widely online, led to 19-year-old Marcella Zoia being charged with mischief endangering life, mischief endangering property under $5,000 and common nuisance.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/video-of-woman-tossing-chair-off-downtown-toronto-balcony-under-investigation-1.4291638">video showed a young woman launch a chair</a> off a balcony over a busy highway.</p>

      <p>Following the mass-circulation of the video, Toronto police urged the woman to come forward and identify herself.</p>
      <p>Zoia <a href="https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/police-identify-woman-seen-on-video-tossing-chair-over-condo-balcony-1.4293628">turned herself in to officials</a> a few days later.</p>
