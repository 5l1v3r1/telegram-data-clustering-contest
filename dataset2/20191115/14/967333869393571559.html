      <p>Mayor Luigi Brugnaro has also ordered the iconic St Mark's Square closed ahead of the latest sea swell of about 1.6 metres (over five feet) as powerful storms and winds hit the region again mid-morning. According to reports, it will be lower than the peak of 12 November but still dangerous.</p>
