      <p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/01/apple-tv-review/">Apple TV+</a> has only just rolled out and it's already nabbed one of the biggest names in showbiz. Acting legend Gary Oldman is set to star in spy drama <i>Slow Horses, </i>an adaptation of Mick Herron's Slough House books, according to <i><a href="https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/gary-oldman-slow-horses-series-apple-1203405839/">Variety</a>.</i></p>
      <p>The show -- named after the first novel in Herron's series -- tells the story of a team of British intelligence agents banished to MI5's lackluster Slough House department due to making major mistakes in the field. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2012/01/05/gary-oldman-spits-out-a-few-reznov-lines-on-conan-in-a-bowtie/">Oldman</a> plays the group's leader, the clever but curmudgeonly Jackson Lamb.</p>
      <p>The role is a departure from the norm for the Academy Award-winning Gary Oldman, who has held few TV parts during his illustrious movie career, which includes the likes of <i>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, </i>the <i><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/16/theres-now-a-harry-potter-subscription-service/">Harry Potter</a> </i>franchise<i>, Dark Knight </i>and <i>True Romance. </i>Perhaps this is an appetizing taste of what's yet to come on Apple's newly-launched platform.</p>
