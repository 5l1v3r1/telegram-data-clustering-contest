      <p>“I advise all Connecticut residents to take the proactive step to protect their health during flu season by getting a flu shot,” said DPH Commissioner Renee D. Coleman-Mitchel, in the news release. “Flu vaccines are safe and effective and can either help prevent you from becoming infected by this serious virus or help lessen your symptoms if you do get sick. Talk to your health care provider, pharmacist or local health department about the easiest way to get a flu shot.”</p>

      <p>As of Nov. 2, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/#S2">the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a> had reported low flu activity nationwide, which has been typical for this time of year in seasons past. As of that same week, there had only been two pediatric deaths reported across the nation, but several other states have reported deaths involving adults. Information from the CDC on adult fatalities was not immediately available.</p>
