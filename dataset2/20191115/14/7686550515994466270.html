      <h1>Don't 'get too obsessed' about school transport as online learning's the future, says councillor</h1>
      <h2>Bridgend County Borough Council plans to overhaul the provision of post-16 education in the county</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T14:56:41+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 14:56</time> by <a rel="author">Elizabeth Bradfield</a></address>
      <p>Bridgend Council’s cabinet member for education has urged his fellow councillors not to obsess over the need to transport students to schools, saying online learning is the future.</p>
      <p>Charles Smith made the comments during a scrutiny meeting on the council’s plans to overhaul the provision of post-16 education in the county, which could see some sixth form centres merge and require students to travel further.</p>
      <p>He said the local authority was moving towards a “21st century solution” which would meet the educational needs of children.</p>
      <p>He told councillors: “In education and the world of work, we will be doing more communication than transportation.</p>
      <p>“I hope you all won’t get too obsessed for the need to shift students around the county in buses, I honestly believe that there are alternatives.”</p>
      <p>The council is currently reviewing its transport for students and could end its financial support for students to get to sixth form and college.</p>
      <p>It is also keen to increase the use of technology in educational settings and wants to see teachers in sixth form centres become trained in building online modules.</p>
      <p>John Fabes, a Bridgend Council post-16 specialist education officer, said: “There are certain subjects where online delivery is practicable, we need to look at the models being used and which might be adopted successfully in Bridgend.</p>
      <p>“I know that colleagues in Anglesey and Gwynedd are now working very closely with the their local FE college, which offers A-levels online, so they buy in an online delivery of certain A-level subjects.</p>
      <p>“In Bridgend we are working on a project which is sponsored by Welsh Government for Further Maths students where the subject was tutored but has now moved completely online.”</p>
      <p>Cllr Smith said the transition would require “maximum collaboration” from schools with common timetabling being essential as well as an investment in both staff and technology.</p>
      <p>He said: “Blended learning isn’t just classroom learning that happens to be online, it’s where things flip, so for example in university, the lecture is no longer the big thing but the smaller group discussions.</p>
      <p>“It is a whole new way of thinking and teaching and it’s not a cheap way of doing it, it needs a huge investment up front.</p>
      <p>“The Open University has been doing it for donkey’s years and we are catching up.”</p>
      <p>Lynsey Morris, a teacher who is also a co-opted member on the scrutiny committee, raised concerns over the adequacy of IT facilities in schools for online learning, saying she had taught in two schools in the county and there were issues with wi-fi in both schools.</p>
      <p>She also said that in her subject of RE, it was necessary to have students in front of her to build a rapport and discuss ethical subjects.</p>
      <p>However, Mr Fabes said blending learning included both face-to-face learning and online learning, adding: “It won’t replace teaching but complement it, providing students with access to lesson materials 24/7.”</p>
      <p>Councillor Jon-Paul Blundell agreed with the move to focus on online learning, saying he didn’t understand why the local authority was still looking at transporting students to school.</p>
      <p>He said: “It seems a very 20th century view of how to get to and from school.</p>
      <p>“In the 21st century there are councils that allow you to phone in and take part in scrutiny meetings when you’re not in the building, and we have meetings across this country with representatives from other local authorities and you don’t even have to leave the building.</p>
      <p>“Why are we then expecting children and 16 to 18-year-olds to make those journeys to school or to sixth form centre in Pencoed when they live in Cynffig, when they can go to the school they’ve always gone to, sit in a classroom, put on their headphones and listen to the teacher via Skype and interact that way?</p>
      <p>“I know it will take capital funding but surely it’s going to be a helluva lot cheaper than building a new building.”</p>
      <p>The scrutiny meeting took place on Wednesday, October 30.</p>
