      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/taylor-swift/">Taylor Swift</a> fans have been dragging <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/shawn-mendes/">Shawn Mendes</a>, questioning the singer on why he’s staying silent<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/taylor-swift-reignites-scooter-braun-feud-encourages-fans-go-manager-claims-blocked-performing-songs-11148397/"> after her statement about Scooter Braun and Scott Borchetta.</a></p>
      <p>Bit awkward.</p>
      <p>In a statement that shocked her followers, Taylor claimed she was ‘not allowed’ to perform her own music on TV and that there’s a ‘question mark’ over her AMAs performance, concerning legal issues with her former record company.</p>
      <p>She also pleaded with her fans to go after Scooter and Scott, saying: ‘The message being sent to me is very clear. Basically, be a good little girl and shut up. Or you’ll be punished.’</p>

      <p>Despite Shawn recently <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/shawn-mendes-remixes-taylor-swifts-lover-ready-break-replay-button-11111238/">collaborating with Taylor on a remix of her hit Lover</a>, he simply took to Instagram to post a snap of his girlfriend Camila Cabello, and Tay’s fans aren’t having any of it.</p>

      <p>‘I’m done we shawn… taylor let you open for her then chooses you to collaborate with, even allowed you to write your own awful lyrics &amp; we know you see what’s happening but you post THAT? typical straight white boy who thinks he deserves a trophy for wearing nail polish. bye [sic],’ one fumed.</p>
      <p>‘Where is shawn. where is ed. where is niall. where are all of these artists that praise taylor when it benefits them but now that taylor is asking them! to speak up! they are…silent,’ another said.</p>

      <p>‘Shawn or ed probably support taylor in private”. THAT’S NOT THE POINT. the point is that they’re men and have a huge platform, but they won’t use it because they want to maintain a good reputation and avoid controversy,’ one more angry fan pointed out.</p>
      <p>Taylor pleaded with her followers for their help in her lengthy statement, writing: ‘Scott Borchetta and Scooter Braun have now said that I’m not allowed to perform my old songs on television because they claim that would be re-recording my music before I’m allowed to next year.’</p>

      <p>She then claimed that Scott – founder of her former label, Big Machine – would only allow her to use her old music if she stopped plans to re-record her original songs.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/big-machine-records-denies-taylor-swift-music-ban-claims-11163830/">Big Machine Records has since denied Taylor’s claims.</a>

      <p>The singer previously called out Scooter after Scott sold him the masters of her first six albums in the summer – a deal worth $300 million (£240 million).</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>She branded the situation the ‘worst case scenario’ and accused Scooter of ‘incessant bullying’ throughout her career, claiming she was never given the opportunity to buy her masters herself and was completely unaware of the deal.</p>
      <p>However, Scott and Scooter – who also manages Ariana Grande, Justin Bieber and Demi Lovato – publicly denied all allegations, stating they were untrue.</p>
