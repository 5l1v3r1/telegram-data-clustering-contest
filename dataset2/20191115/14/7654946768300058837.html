      <h1>Santa Clarita shooting: Dad of Nathaniel Berhow was avid hunter who used to ‘make bullets’: reports</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T14:25:44+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 14:25</time> by <a rel="author">Amanda Woods</a></address>
      <p>The late father of the teen <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/14/police-responding-to-report-of-school-shooting-in-california/">who authorities say opened fire</a> inside a Southern California high school — killing two students and injuring at least three more on his birthday — was an avid hunter who used to “make bullets,” according to new reports.</p>
      <p>The gunman, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/14/santa-clarita-high-school-shooter-identified-as-nathaniel-berhow/">identified in multiple outlets</a> as 16-year-old Nathaniel Berhow, allegedly stormed into Saugus High School in Santa Clarita just before classes began Thursday and opened fire with a .45-caliber semi-automatic pistol before turning the gun on himself, police said.</p>
      <p>He survived the self-inflicted gunshot wound to his head and is listed in “grave condition.”</p>
      <p>The alleged shooter’s father, Mark Berhow, died in December 2017 from a heart attack, but a “history of chronic alcoholism” contributed to his death, the Los Angeles County Coroner’s Office told The Post on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“His dad – I know he used to make bullets, so I’m assuming he had guns and stuff like that,” Ryan McCracken, 20, a former childhood friend of Berhow, <a href="https://ktla.com/2019/11/14/former-friend-of-suspected-saugus-high-school-shooter-describes-him-as-a-quiet-kid/">told KTLA</a>.</p>
      <p>Berhow was “an avid sportsman” who “loved big game hunting and fishing of all kinds,” <a href="https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/avpress/obituary.aspx?n=mark-berhow&amp;pid=187564617&amp;fhid=12074">according to an obituary for him</a>.</p>

      <p>Sources in the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-11-14/saugus-high-school-shooting-suspect">told the Los Angeles Times</a> that the elder Berhow was a hunter and owned several weapons.</p>
      <p>He hunted elk, and his son would sometimes tag along, neighbor Jared Axen, 33, a registered nurse, told the Times.</p>
      <p>Axen told KTLA that he believes the teen was “the one who had found his father’s body inside the house” when he died.</p>
      <p>Two years before his death, the elder Berhow had been arrested over a domestic dispute with the boy’s mother.</p>
      <p>In 2016, shortly before Mark Berhow died, the alleged shooter’s mom sued him for custody of their children, <a href="https://trellis.law/case/BD636153/MAMI-MATSUURA-BERHOW-VS-MARK-BERHOW">according to records from Trellis</a>.</p>
      <p>Nathaniel Berhow is a half-Japanese student whose family lives in Valencia, California, about two miles from the school.</p>
      <p>Classmates described him as a “quiet kid” whom they’d never expect to be capable of a school shooting.</p>
