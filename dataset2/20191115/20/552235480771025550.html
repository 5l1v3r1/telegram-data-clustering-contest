      <p>Rangers midfielder <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glen-kamara">Glen Kamara</a> was influential in his side's 3-0 victory over Liechtenstein as they secured their place at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/euro-2020">Euro 2020</a> .</p>
      <p>Former Celtic striker <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/teemu-pukki">Teemu Pukki</a> scored a double after Jasse Tuominen opened the scoring for the Finns, as they made it a historic night for their nation.</p>
      <p>The result meant they now have a seven point lead over Greece in third place with just one more round of games to play, meaning they will compete in their first ever major championship next summer.</p>
      <p>Kamara played the full 90 minutes for his country tonight, as the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> midfielder put in an assured display in the middle of the park.</p>
      <p>He's been a key asset for Finland in the qualification campaign, helping his team earn wins over the likes of Greece and Armenia earlier this season.</p>
      <p>The Ibrox midfielder played 90 minutes for Steven Gerrard's side against Livingston on Sunday, but that didn't affect the midfielder's performance tonight in the middle of the park.</p>

      <p>Finnish fans were raving about his display on social media, comparing him to the likes of Barcelona's Sergio Busquets and Xavi.</p>
      <p><b>ManneLaukkanen said</b> : Glen Kamara was our Busquets / Xavi throughout the game. Really good game.</p>
      <p><b>SMDD14 said:</b> Glen Kamara has also been excellent in the middle during the whole [European qualifiers] campaign</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p><b>Michael Trepczyk said</b> : Glen Kamara looks an absolute talent. He's absolutely controlled the midfield tonight. Granted, it's only Liechtenstein, but Kamara has probably been the best player on the pitch.</p>
      <p><b>Josh Bunting said</b> : Teemu Pukki at the double tonight this could be the night he rediscovers his early season form. Goals breed confidence,Glen Kamara has been outstanding however the Rangers midfielder bringing so much energy to Finlands game.</p>
      <p><b>Matt Vernot</b> : Glen Kamara running that midfield</p>
