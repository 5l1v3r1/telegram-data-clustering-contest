      <p>Friends of Gracie Muehlberger, the first <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/14/police-responding-to-report-of-school-shooting-in-california/">Santa Clarita school shooting</a> victim to be identified, posted numerous tributes to her life on Instagram Friday — remembering the freshman as a good friend who loved to joke around.</p>
      <p>“Gracie was a kind-hearted, very funny girl that didn’t deserve to die,” friend Jonathan Harris told The Post <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B43N0o2Fz9P/">after writing about Muehlberger on Instagram.</a></p>
      <p>“[She] didn’t deserve to die. Almost every night I was on [FaceTime] with her [and] she did nothing besides make me laugh and giggle.</p>
      <p>“She was always fun to be around and was never a hater.”</p>
      <p>Muehlberger <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/santa-clarita-shooting-gracie-anne-muehlberger-identified-as-a-victim/">was the first victim to be identified</a> in Thursday’s Saugus High School shooting, where 16-year-old Nathaniel Berhow chose his own birthday to open fire on his classmates with a .45 caliber semi-automatic pistol just before classes began.</p>
      <p><a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/14/santa-clarita-high-school-shooter-identified-as-nathaniel-berhow/">Berhow killed Muehlberger</a>, another 14-year-old male and injured three others before turning the gun on himself, leaving him in grave condition at an area hospital, which means he’s clinging to life and in critical condition.</p>
      <p>More friends took to Instagram to share their feelings about Muehlberger in a slew of videos and photos that painted a picture of a kid who loved making silly Snapchat videos and hanging out with her friends.</p>
      <p>A friend with the Instagram name “daisyyfranc3” <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B43abYwFWKJ/">wrote she wishes she</a> “could trade places” with Muehlberger.</p>
      <p>“I can’t believe one minute I was joking around with you at the mall and the next your not even here to say anything. Pony will be missed,” the post read, referencing a nickname for the teen.</p>
      <p>Another friend, Ariane.vill on Instagram, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B438hN4F_up/">posted a tribute video</a> of Muehlberger that showed the teen dabbing, making references from the movie Mean Girls and enjoying a drink for Chik-fil-A. </p>
      <p>“after i heard rumors going around that you had passed, i didn’t want to believe it. i went to sleep so i didn’t have to think about it, but i woke up only to find out those rumors were true,” Ariane.vill wrote.</p>
      <p>“i remember meeting you in choir in 7th grade. you were one of the most funny and outgoing people in that class. i remember laughing so hard when we used to make vine references at the most random times. you were there when i was alone and at my darkest. i took you for granted. we lost a beautiful voice and a beautiful person. i’m gonna miss you so much. i love you so much.”</p>
