      <h1>Back in the saddle: Alberta senior cycles 122-km race on donated lungs</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T20:30:56+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 20:30</time> by <a rel="author">Shawn Logan</a></address>
      <p>It’s said that riding a bike is a breeze, even if one hasn’t put foot to pedal for years.</p>
      <p>For Fort Saskatchewan senior Doug Pearson, he hoped that same analogy could extend to the basic ins and outs of breathing. It had been years since Pearson had been able to breathe normally due to a lengthy battle with lung disease. But he believed the simple act of taking a breath would again come naturally after receiving a transplant to replace his failing organs.</p>
      <p>Despite leading an active life, the 65-year-old had always struggled to catch his breath, often tiring quickly during physical activity. But by 2010, even walking up a flight of stairs was a torturous undertaking. He would ultimately be diagnosed with interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, which causes progressive scarring of lung tissue and is generally irreversible.</p>
      <p>His health worsened during a cruise vacation in 2016. Pearson suffered a blood clot that left him nearly unable to breathe, leading to an airlift back home to Alberta.</p>
      <p>Like many other people with serious illnesses, he landed on a transplant wait list. Fortuitously for him, however, his blood type and lung size made the act of finding a matching set of lungs a relatively swift process.</p>
      <p>A month after Pearson thought he might be taking his final breaths, he got the phone call telling him his surgery was scheduled for the next day.</p>
      <p>On Sept. 5, 2016, Pearson got new lungs and a new lease on life.</p>
      <p>“It had been 20 years since I was able to do anything without coughing,” he recalled from his home in Fort Saskatchewan, northeast of Edmonton.</p>
      <p>“It was quite amazing,” he said of how he felt with new lungs.</p>
      <p>As his body healed and he was able to to engage in more physical activity, Pearson reacquainted himself with an old friend he hadn’t seen for quite a while.</p>
      <p>“I still had my old bike that I got in 1993,” said Pearson, who earlier in life had been an avid cyclist, doing the 310-kilometre Golden Triangle trail between Golden and Lake Louise.</p>
      <p>So, he started riding. As he became more comfortable riding longer distances, a friend suggested he give his new lungs a true baptism and enter the gruelling 122-kilometre Gran Fondo ride from Vancouver to Whistler, B.C. — a scenic and challenging route which ascends some 1,900 metres along the Sea to Sky Highway.</p>
      <p>In September 2019 — two days after the third anniversary of his life-changing transplant — Pearson joined some 4,500 other cyclists (likely all of whom had their original lungs) at the ride’s starting line.</p>

      <p>“You start off in Stanley Park and then it’s all up hill,” Pearson said. “That first 70 kilometres felt pretty light but that last 55 kilometres from Squamish on, I didn’t feel very good. I could have quit 10 times over the last 20 kilometres.”</p>
      <p>But he didn’t.</p>
      <p>Shaking off the pain, the fatigue and pushing his second set of lungs to the limit, Pearson persevered and completed the race in seven hours, 42 minutes and 43 seconds.</p>
      <p>He ranked 3,502 of the 3,618 who completed the race.</p>
      <p>“I thought there’s no way in hell I’m quitting,” Pearson said, adding the notion of doing an event like that with a pair of donated lungs still seems surreal.</p>
      <p>“Never in my wildest dreams did I think I could do this.”</p>
      <p>Long-term survival following a lung transplant is far from guaranteed. According to statistics from the Canadian Institute for Health Information, some 86 per cent of lung transplant patients in 2010 survived for at least one year after the surgery. The odds drop from there, with 75.5 per cent living another three years and 65.5 per cent of patients during the same period making it to five years.</p>
      <p>For Pearson, who has returned to work part-time at a local pro shop, he’s already planning his next challenge — the 152-kilometre Kootenay Rockies Gran Fondo in Cranbrook next summer.</p>
      <p>And he has some positive advice for those who are in critical need of organs, especially when they think about future plans and personal possessions.</p>
      <p>“If I were ever to talk to anybody going in for a transplant, I would say, ‘Don’t give anything away,’” he said. “You’ve got to keep that stuff for when you get better.”</p>
