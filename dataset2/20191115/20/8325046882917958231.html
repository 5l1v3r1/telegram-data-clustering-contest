      <p>The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-impeachment-major-players-timeline-what-comes-next-2019-11">impeachment inquiry</a> into President <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-donald-trump-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-4">Donald Trump</a> has officially moved into its public phase, and witnesses are beginning to testify in open session before the House Intelligence Committee, House Committee on Foreign Affairs, and House Oversight Committee, who are jointly pursuing the inquiry.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/biggest-takeaways-bill-taylor-george-kent-testimony-trump-impeachment-hearing-2019-11">the public phase of the inquiry kicked off</a> with the testimony of acting US ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor and State Department official George Kent.</p>
      <p>The two diplomats <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-impeachment-hearings-schedule-how-to-watch-live-updates-2019-11">corroborated previous witness testimony</a> that Trump and members of his administration used a $400 million military aid package to Ukraine as leverage to pressure its government to announce investigations that would be politically favorable to Trump.</p>
      <p>And on Friday, former US ambassador to Ukraine <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-impeachment-hearings-yovanovitch-testimony-updates-2019-11">Marie Yovanovitch</a>, a career diplomat, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-impeachment-hearings-yovanovitch-testimony-updates-2019-11">gave gripping testimony</a> detailing how Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani pushed her out of her position earlier this year after over three decades of service in the State Department.</p>
      <p>Now, the House committees have announced that nine more diplomats and national security officials – many of whom have already appeared to testify behind closed-doors – <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/12/house-intel-announces-additional-witnesses-for-public-impeachment-hearings-000327">will testify publicly in the next few days.</a></p>

            <li>Former NSC senior director for Russian and Eurasian affairs <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/fiona-hill">Fiona Hill</a> will testify publicly before the committees.</li>

      </ul>
      <p>The impeachment inquiry all started with an anonymous whistleblower’s complaint, turned over to Congress in early September, that Trump was “using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country” in the 2020 US election in a series of events culminating in a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.</p>
      <p>The complaint specifically charged that Trump’s pressure on the Ukrainian government to investigate alleged corruption from former Vice President <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-joe-biden-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-3">Joe Biden</a> and his son Hunter came days after he <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-ukraine-military-aid-phone-call-2019-9">withheld a nearly $400 million military-aid package to Ukraine</a> that Congress had already appropriated.</p>
      <p>The White House’s notes of the call confirm Trump brought up how the US does “a lot for Ukraine.” Immediately after, Trump asked Zelensky to do him a “favor, though” by investigating Biden and a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election to benefit Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and was somehow in possession of a Democratic National Committee server.</p>
      <p>In the past month, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-impeachment-hearings-what-we-know-ukraine-quid-pro-quo-2019-11">multiple diplomats and national security officials</a> have testified that Trump and Giuliani explicitly conditioned both releasing the aid and inviting Zelensky to a meeting at the White House on Ukraine putting out at a statement announcing investigations into the Bidens and the 2016 election.</p>
