      <h1>Caputo, booted from Stone trial, alleges threat from U.S. marshal</h1>

      <p>WASHINGTON – Michael R. Caputo of East Aurora sat for two weeks as his best friend, Roger Stone, went on trial on felony charges of perjury and witness tampering.</p>
      <p>But when the federal jury convicted Stone on all counts Friday, Caputo quickly showed his displeasure – and got into a scrape with a U.S. marshal as a result.</p>
      <p>After the verdict, Caputo refused to stand in respect for the jury, as is customary. Told by a U.S. marshal that he had to do so, Caputo stood – and turned his back on the jury.</p>
      <p>"I decided to do something to show my displeasure without disrupting the proceedings," Caputo said afterward.</p>
      <p>A U.S. marshal then ordered Caputo out of the courtroom, handing the Republican political consultant off to another federal agent.</p>
      <p>That's when, according to Caputo, things got uncomfortable.</p>

      <p>"I don’t know how you work here," Caputo told the U.S. marshal, according to Caputo's account of the incident on Twitter.</p>
      <p>"It's a job, sir," the marshal replied.</p>
      <p>Caputo's retort?</p>
      <p>"I'd rather die."</p>
      <p>To hear Caputo tell it, the marshal then said: "That can be arranged."</p>

      <p> Caputo took that as a death threat.</p>
      <p>"Must I fear the @USMarshalsHQ?" he said on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Afterward, Caputo said he was contemplating filing a complaint or contacting a lawyer about the marshal's actions.</p>
      <p>"From my perspective, at the least it's completely unprofessional," Caputo said. "And at the worst, it's truly frightening."</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for the U.S. Marshals Service did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Caputo's tweet.</p>
      <p>Stone was convicted of lying to Congress and interfering with a witness regarding his attempts to get information from WikiLeaks about its pending release of emails damaging to the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, in the 2016 presidential campaign.</p>
      <p>Caputo had strong words as well as actions for the jury that convicted Stone, as well as U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who was appointed to the bench by then-President Barack Obama, a Democrat.</p>
      <p>"Normal Americans don’t stand a chance with an Obama judge and a Washington jury," Caputo tweeted.</p>
