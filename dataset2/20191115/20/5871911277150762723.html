      <h1>Former LSU teammates Jamal Adams, Leonard Fournette go at it on Twitter</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T20:57:02+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 20:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thesportsdaily.com/author/tsd-staff/" target="_blank">TSD Staff</a></address>
      <p>Jets safety Jamal Adams and Jaguars running back Leonard Fournette may have played on the same team back in college at LSU, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they’re friends.</p>
      <p>Fournette was recently on Twitter, campaigning for Pro Bowl votes, and that prompted Adams to reply, indicating that the Jaguars running back shouldn’t be so “thirsty” — essentially telling him to not beg for votes.</p>
      <p>That didn’t go over well with Fournette, who had this to say, in a since-deleted tweet:</p>
      <p>“Now Jamal don’t start with the thirsty stuff, you said you had a chip on yo’ shoulders since ’05 boy yo ass ain’t know what a chip was back than,” Fournette wrote.</p>
      <p>And then he tweeted out the following.</p>

      <p>And while Adams took it on the chin at first, he came back strong with this banger.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Then Fournette came back with this lame retort.</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/_fournette/status/1195366937284554753?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>

      <p>Adams won that round, we think.</p>
