      <p>A two-year-old leopard strayed into the industrial area of Sarurpur in Faridabad, sending locals into panic Friday. Police said that the leopard came from the Aravallis and was seen jumping from one building to another by residents, before he jumped inside a factory.</p>
      <p>Police said one of the local boys saw the leopard rolling on the ground near a tree on Thursday night but he did not inform anyone as he was unsure. On Friday morning, around 9 am, a woman was standing outside her house with her son when she saw the leopard. “I thought I saw a tiger and screamed… the animal looked at me and ran inside the factory,” the woman said.</p>
      <p>“We received a call around 9 am about a wild animal roaming in the area, so we immediately informed the wildlife department and headed to the spot. We found that the leopard had climbed the wall of a factory and jumped inside but got stuck there. We took a metal sheet and covered its entry point on the roof and locked all exits,” said a police officer.</p>
      <p>Police said that officials from the wildlife department came with tranquiliser guns. Rajkumar, one of the officers with the wildlife department, said a personnel fired a tranquiliser shot at the leopard: “It fell unconscious. We will take him back to our facility and free him in the forest.”</p>
