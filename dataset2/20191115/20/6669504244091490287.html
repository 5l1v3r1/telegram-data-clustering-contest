      <p>With three months left until the 60th Vernon Winter Carnival, anticipation is running high for the abundance of new events.</p>
      <p>Vicki Proulx, executive director, said in a media release the community is at the heart of this year's <a href="https://infotel.ca/newsitem/2020-vernon-winter-carnival-will-be-all-about-the-60s/it60460">Carnival Remembers the 60s</a>, which runs Feb. 7 to 16, 2020.</p>
      <p>"We asked the community to get involved for the 60th anniversary and the response was overwhelming," Proulx said in the release. “We are thrilled with the amount of returning and new events.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://infotel.ca/newsitem/a-treasure-chest-of-events-for-vernon-winter-carnival/it57847">More than 125 events are in the books for the 2020 carnival</a>.</p>
      <p>Some events new to the 60th anniversary carnival include a Queen Silver Star Snowflake Ball on Feb. 8, a dinner theatre musical comedy Feb. 11 to 15, Remember the 60s at the museum on Feb. 14, the Snowed in Comedy Tour also on Feb. 14, a pancake breakfast at the Halina Centre Feb. 15, the JCI Rock Stars Bonspiel Feb. 15 and the TKH Kids Club Dance Party Feb. 16.</p>
      <p>Proulx said 2020 will also see the return of the iconic ice palace and sheriff's jail traditions. Fireworks kick off the festival Feb. 7.</p>
      <p>“It’s hard to believe that Vernon Winter Carnival will begin in less than three months," carnival chair Deb White said in the release. "Your board of directors has been working hard along with Vicki, our executive director, to ensure that Carnival Remembers the 60s is a very memorable year. So many new events as well as bringing back some of the favourite events from years past. I can’t wait.”</p>
      <p>Tickets for more than 30 iconic events go on sale Dec. 6, many of which, Proulx said, sell out within hours. Tickets to popular events like Suds N Cider can only be purchased in-store or over the phone.</p>
