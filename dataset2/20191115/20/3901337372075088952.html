      <p>Zimbabwe, who fielded a number of Premier Soccer League stars, opened their 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying campaign with a goalless draw against Botwsana on Friday evening.</p>
      <p>The Warriors put out an impressive line-up that included Aston Villa midfielder Marvelous Nakamba, Khama Billiat, Knox Mutizwa and European-based defenders, Teenage Hadebe and Marshall Munetsi.</p>
      <p>Zimbabwe were on the front foot in the early stages, asking questions of the Zebras but they only got their first clear chance around the half-hour mark after being awarded a free-kick, but goalkeeper Kabelo Dambe was on hand to keep out Knowledge Musona's effort.</p>

      <p>Musona turned provider from the resultant corner after picking out Mutizwa, who sent his header well over the crossbar as the frustration began to build for the home side.</p>
      <p>Joey Antipas' troops kept on putting the visitors under pressure after the break, Mutizwa missed another headed chance, while left-back Ronald Pfumbidzai was denied from close range by Dambe.</p>
      <p>The Zebras were struggling with the pace of the game after the hour-mark, with Amrouche forced to take out Tlhalefo Molebatsi due to injury and Maano Ditshupo was brought on as his replacement.</p>
      <p>Despite the late push from Zimbabwe, Botswana were able to hold out for the remaining stages of the half to claim a valuable point on the road in their qualifying opener.</p>
