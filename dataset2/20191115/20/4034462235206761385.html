      <p>The top ten of <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/car-reliability-owner-satisfaction/who-makes-the-most-reliable-cars/">Consumer Reports'</a> most reliable car ranking is a desirable place for automakers to be. This year, Dodge entered the top ten for the first time and is the only representative of the Detroit Big Three in the list. Ford is languishing just below Lincoln in 16th place with the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/ford/f-150">Ford F-150</a> as its least reliable model, while Chevrolet is way down in 25th spot with the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/chevrolet/tahoe">Tahoe</a> being its most reliable model.</p>
      <p>As for Dodge, the least reliable model, according to Consumer Reports surveys, is the Durango, and its most reliable model is the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/dodge/challenger-r-t">Challenger</a>.</p>

      <p>Dodge climbed thirteen spots to reach number eight on the list, helping its parent company, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA), achieve the most significant gains overall. Dodge's improvements are likely down to a lack of new models and showing that new isn't always best for the consumer.</p>
      <p>Consumer Reports is also reporting that the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/tesla-model-3-loses-consumer-reports-recommendation">Tesla Model 3 and Model S have regained a Consumer Reports recommendation</a> due to an increase in reliability. "The Tesla Model 3 struggled last year as the company made frequent design changes and ramped up production to meet demand," says Jake Fisher, senior director of auto testing at Consumer Reports. "But as the production stabilized, we have seen improvements to the reliability."</p>
