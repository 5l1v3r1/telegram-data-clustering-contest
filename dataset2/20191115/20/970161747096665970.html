        <b>After Robert Preston (Tristan Gemmill) was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/04/coronation-street-spoilers-robert-preston-horror-car-crash-ahead-death-story-11037599/">involved in a horrifying car accident</a> in Coronation Street, Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh) began to question how much she actually trusted her fiancé, what with him always sneaking off and being evasive. His questions about a baby — coupled with the Big Daddy necklace — <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/09/coronation-street-spoilers-robert-prestons-affair-exposed-after-terrible-car-crash-10904055/">raised her suspicions all the more</a>, so tonight she set about getting the truth.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In spite of his injury, Robert was determined to be up and about in tonight’s episode, spinning Michelle a lie about how he had stuff to do. However, unbeknown to him, Michelle had his phone, and once Robert was out of dodge, both her and Carla (Alison King) analysed the device for secret messages or pictures.</p>
      <p>Michelle decided to ring Robert’s work, only to discover that there is no Robert Preston in catering at the youth offenders — meaning that he’s been lying to her for months. Perceptive as ever, Carla then discovered directions to a Macclesfield address, and thus they set off to get to the bottom of what’s going on.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, having realised Michelle is the one he wants to be with, Robert broke up with Vicky (Kerri Quinn) — who was left devastated by his sudden bombshell.  She kicked him out of the house — just as Michelle and Carla’s vehicle pulled up. After realising Vicky was pregnant, Michelle put two and two together.</p>

      <p>She confronted Robert on the matter, but he claimed that he’d only slept with Vicky while they were separated, and spun her a convincing lie about how Vicky had him over a barrel — hence why he’s been visiting her so often.</p>
      <p>Sick of being lied to, Michelle set off to get some answers from the woman herself, and Vicky was shocked to discover that Robert had been seeing her too. Michelle was quick to make out that Vicky was lying, but every word that came out of her mouth made some degree of sense — and ultimately became more convincing than what Robert had told her.</p>

      <p>A devastated Michelle returned home, and told Robert that she didn’t believe Vicky’s ‘lies’, and that she wanted them to work through it together. However, after he went off to bed, Michelle rang Adam (Sam Robertson) to make an urgent appointment, before bringing a ‘deeds of ownership’ document into her eyeline.</p>
      <p>It’s pretty clear that Michelle believed everything Vicky told her, which means that her words to Robert about wanting to work through their troubles are nothing more than lies.</p>
      <p>Yes, she’s clearly planning on taking him for everything that he’s got, and with Adam set to help her out, it’s likely that she’ll succeed in doing so.</p>
      <p>Will Michelle <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/coronation-street-spoilers-michelle-connor-plots-her-revenge-against-cheating-robert-preston-10957898/">get her revenge on her two-timing fiancé?</a></p>
      <p>With Robert <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/21/coronation-street-spoilers-robert-preston-shot-killed-christmas-day-10954387/">seemingly set to lose his life in an armed siege over the Christmas period</a>, Michelle discovering the truth could end up leading to a difficult few months for the Bistro owner.</p>
