      <h1>Director Todd Phillips Explains What a Joker Sequel Would Need</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T20:32:38+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 20:32</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Workman</a></address>
      <p>Although <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/joker"><b>Joker</b></a> was designed as a stand alone, the film’s incredible box office success means that Arthur Fleck’s story could continue. Director Todd Phillips has started to warm up to the idea of doing a sequel. Phillips recently spoke with the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2019-11-13/joaquin-phoenix-joker-fan-theories-sequel-oscars">Los Angeles Times</a> about a possible <b>Joker</b> follow-up, and what would have to be in it.</p>
      <p>“It couldn’t just be this wild and crazy movie about the ‘Clown Prince of Crime,’” explained Phillips. “It would have to have some thematic resonance in a similar way that this does. Because I think that’s ultimately why the movie connected, it’s what’s going on underneath. So many movies are about the spark, and this is about the powder. If you could capture that again in a real way, that would be interesting.”</p>
      <p>Phillips may not be the only one entertaining the idea of doing a sequel. <b>Joker</b> star Joaquin Phoenix also noted his interest in returning during his own  <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2019-11-01/joker-sequel-joaquin-phoenix-fan-theories">L.A. Times</a> interview earlier this month.</p>

      <p>“Long before the release or before we had any idea if it would be successful, we talked about sequels,” said Phoenix. “In the second or third week of shooting, I was like, ‘Todd, can you start working on a sequel? There’s way too much to explore.’ It was kind of in jest — but not really.”</p>
      <p>Warner Bros. has yet to announce any plans for a <b>Joker</b> sequel. But with the film still breaking box office records in theaters, it will probably be inevitable. </p>
