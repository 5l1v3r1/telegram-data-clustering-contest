      <h1>Zverev advances to semis at ATP Finals; Nadal eliminated</h1>

      <p><b>LONDON — </b>Defending champion Alexander Zverev secured the last semifinal spot at the ATP Finals on Friday — eliminating Rafael Nadal in the process.</p>
      <p>Zverev beat already eliminated Daniil Medvedev 6-4, 7-6 (4) at the O2 Arena to finish second behind Stefanos Tsitsipas in the group and set up a semifinal against Dominic Thiem.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Nadal stayed in contention by rallying to beat Tsitsipas 6-7 (4), 6-4, 7-5 for his second win of the round-robin stage.</p>
      <p>But Zverev’s win left him, Nadal, and Tsitispas with identical 2-1 records — with the top-ranked Spaniard eliminated based on the tournament’s tiebreaker rules.</p>
      <p>Medvedev (0-3) had only pride to play for against Zverev and was broken in the opening game. The Russian largely held his own after that but couldn’t force a single break point and double-faulted to go 5-3 down in the second-set tiebreaker.</p>
      <p>Zverev converted his first match point with an ace.</p>
      <p>Tsitsipas will face six-time champion Roger Federer in the first semifinal on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Greek had already secured a semifinal spot by winning his opening two matches but still pushed Nadal to the wire in a match that lasted nearly three hours.</p>
      <p>That effort could cost him against Federer, who needed only 1 hour, 13 minutes to beat Novak Djokovic in his final group-stage match on Thursday and spent Friday resting up.</p>
      <p>But at 21, Tsitsipas is 17 years younger than Federer, and said he felt confident he’ll recover quickly.</p>
      <p>”It’s OK, my body feels well currently,” Tsitsipas said. ”I don't feel pain anywhere. I feel fresh, honestly. After having a long, difficult match like this, I feel like I can go out and play tomorrow the same way. So I don't have any problem with that.”</p>
      <p>After saving a match point at 5-1 down in the third set against Medvedev on Wednesday before rallying to win, Nadal’s comeback wasn’t quite as dramatic this time.</p>
      <p>He never faced a break point in the match but lost the last three points of the first-set tiebreaker to hand Tsitsipas the lead.</p>
      <p>But he broke for a 5-3 lead in the second set and again to make it 6-5 in the third, then converted his first match point when Tsitsipas netted a forehand.</p>
      <p>After the match, Nadal was presented with a trophy on court for having secured the year-end No. 1 ranking.</p>
      <p>Djokovic’s chances of overtaking him ended when he was eliminated with the loss to Federer.</p>
      <p>It’s the fifth time that the 19-time Grand Slam winner ends the year atop the rankings, tied for second on the all-time list with Djokovic, Federer and Jimmy Connors. Pete Sampras did it six times.</p>
      <p>At 33, Nadal is the oldest man to finish the year as No. 1.</p>
      <p>”Honestly, after all the things that I went through in my career in terms of injuries, I never thought that at the age of 33 1/2, I would have this trophy in my hands again,” Nadal said.</p>
      <p>However, he has never won the ATP Finals despite qualifying for a 15th year in a row. He has had to pull out of the tournament on six occasions because of injuries and reached the final only twice, the last time in 2013.</p>
