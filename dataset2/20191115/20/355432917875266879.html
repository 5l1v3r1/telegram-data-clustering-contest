      <h1>Trump defends Yovanovitch attack: 'I have freedom of speech'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T20:12:31+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 20:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/brett-samuels" target="_blank">Brett Samuels</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a> on Friday defended his tweet earlier in the day attacking former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine <a href="https://thehill.com/people/marie-yovanovitch">Marie Yovanovitch</a> in the middle of her public testimony in the House impeachment hearing, insisting he has the right to speak out.</p>
      <p>"I have the right to speak. I have freedom of speech just like other people do," Trump told reporters at the White House after making remarks on a health care initiative, adding that he's "allowed to speak up" if others are speaking about him.</p>
      <p>Pressed on whether his words can be intimidating, as Yovanovitch and Democrats have said, Trump said no.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think so at all," he said.</p>
      <p>The remarks were Trump's first public comments of the day, which has largely been dominated by testimony from Yovanovitch. As the former ambassador testified about a smear campaign by Trump's allies to oust her from her post in Kyiv, <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/470626-trump-criticizes-yovanovitch-during-her-public-testimony">the president took aim at her</a> on Twitter.</p>
      <p>“Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad. She started off in Somalia, how did that go? Then fast forward to Ukraine, where the new Ukrainian President spoke unfavorably about her in my second phone call with him," Trump tweeted. "It is a U.S. President’s absolute right to appoint ambassadors.”</p>
      <p>In a stunning moment, House Intelligence Committee Chairman <a href="https://thehill.com/people/adam-schiff">Adam Schiff</a> (D-Calif.) interrupted questioning from his staff counsel to read the president’s tweet aloud to Yovanovitch and asked for her reaction.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think I have such powers,” Yovanovitch said with a slight laugh. “Not in Mogadishu, Somalia, not in other places.”</p>
      <p>Asked what effect Trump’s tweet might have on future witnesses facing pressure from the White House not to testify, <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/470636-yovanovitch-responds-to-trump-tweets-at-hearing-says-hes-trying-to">Yovanovitch described it</a> as “very intimidating.”</p>
      <p>Democrats on the committee and elsewhere in the House <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/470653-democrats-say-trump-tweet-witness-intimidation-fuels-impeachment-push">equated Trump's tweet to witness intimidation</a> and suggested that it could be considered when mulling articles of impeachment later in the process.</p>
      <p>The White House on Friday morning issued a statement that Trump would not be watching Yovanovitch's testimony beyond opening statements. But Trump himself said that he had tuned in.</p>
      <p>"I watched a little bit of it today. I wasn't able to yesterday because we had the president of Turkey here, and I wasn’t able to watch much," Trump said. "I watched some of it this morning and I thought it was a disgrace."</p>
      <p>Trump complained that Republicans were not given a fair shake, referencing an instance where Schiff stopped Rep. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/elise-stefanik">Elise Stefanik</a> (R-N.Y.) from questioning Yovanovitch because the rules stipulated that only the ranking member or Republican counsel could ask questions during that period.</p>
      <p>"It’s a disgrace and it’s an embarrassment to our nation," Trump said.</p>
      <p>Yovanovitch is the third witness to testify publicly in the House impeachment inquiry. Several other current and former administration officials are scheduled to give public testimony next week.</p>
