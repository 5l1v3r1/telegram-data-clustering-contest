      <p>Michael O’Neill has left the door open to stepping away from Northern Ireland before a potential Euro 2020 play-off next year.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/08/michael-oneillappointed-stoke-managerbut-will-complete-northern/">O’Neill took over as Stoke City manager last week but agreed to remain in charge of Northern Ireland’s final two qualifiers</a> against Holland at Windsor Park on Saturday night and Germany in Frankfurt on Tuesday, as well as a possible play-off in March.</p>
      <p>But, despite <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/11/northern-ireland-defender-jonny-evans-admits-players-confused/">insisting that the Stoke job was not a distraction</a> ahead of the Holland and Germany games, the 50-year-old stopped short of guaranteeing he would take charge of any play-off involving Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>“That’s the plan, at the minute,” O’Neill said. When pressed on whether he may or may not step away, the Northern Ireland manager <b>– </b>whose side still have a faint chance of automatic qualification for the Euros <b>–</b> added: “I think I answered your question. I’m sure I did.”</p>
      <p>O’Neill enjoyed a flying start at Stoke with a 4-2 win at Barnsley in his first match on Saturday and his focus now turns to trying to secure Northern Ireland’s qualification for a second successive European Championships.</p>
      <p>Given that any play-off would likely be played away from home at this stage, the Holland game could prove to be O’Neill’s final outing at Windsor after eight years in charge but he insisted it did not feel like the start of his farewell.</p>
      <p>“No, it doesn’t feel like that at all,” he said. “The week for me has been no different from any other week, it genuinely hasn’t. We got the work done, the players have been very focused <b>–</b> more focused than they’ve been in the past. Maybe they’re hoping that as a club manager now I may sign them. They’ve been extra attentive.</p>
      <p>“No [it’s not a distraction]. I was only a club manager for one day. One day’s training and then played the game. I’m still very much an international manager while still keeping abreast of things at the club.</p>
      <p>“Next week [at Stoke] we will have three days of work before we play [against Wigan Athletic] and typically when you come into an international, you have three days to prepare a team, so preparing a team for the next league game will not faze me with three days’ preparation. I genuinely don’t think it’s an issue.”</p>
      <p>Steven Davies, the Northern Ireland captain, agreed. “It hasn’t affected our preparations,” said the Rangers midfielder, who added that he hoped O’Neill would not only be in charge of a potential play-off but also lead the teams at the Euros should they get that far.</p>
      <p>Northern Ireland will certainly not be short of motivation against Holland, who have doubts over Memphis Depay (hamstring) and Georginio Wijnaldum (illness), after a lingering spat between O’Neill and Ronald Koeman.</p>
      <p>Koeman had branded Northern Ireland “outrageous” and “terrible to watch” after Holland’s 3-1 win in Rotterdam last month, with the Dutch manager particularly frustrated by their perceived time-wasting.</p>

      <p>But O’Neill shot back at Koeman on Friday and revealed that the ball had been in play for 57 minutes in that game, which was the fifth highest total in Holland’s past 10 matches.</p>
      <p>“So other teams have wasted more time than we wasted,” O’Neill said. “I think we managed the game well which upset the Dutch, they got frustrated. When you’ve an embarrassment of riches and you’re suddenly 1-0 down to Northern Ireland, that leads to frustration. We don’t need any more motivation. We aim to make it as uncomfortable for the Dutch as possible.”</p>
      <p>Koeman apologised for any offence caused and blamed the referee for not clamping down on the apparent time-wasting but added: “If they like to take it as extra motivation … good luck.”</p>
