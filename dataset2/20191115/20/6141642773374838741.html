      <p>Almost 100 flood warnings remain in place across England and Wales, as the wet weather finally begins to show signs of subsiding.</p>
      <p>Communities in parts of central and northern England are cleaning up after being overwhelmed with water following torrential rain in recent days.</p>
      <p>However, things could start to improve over the weekend. When asked whether this was the end of the wet period, forecaster Helen Roberts said: “The simple answer is yes, with the caveat that there will be some rain across the weekend.”</p>
      <p>A band of rain will make its way north-westwards across England on Friday night “but it will weaken as it moves through”, Ms Roberts added.</p>

      <p>“It’s not looking as bad as recent days or weeks. It’s going to be a quieter spell over the weekend.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Government last night responded to criticism of its support of affected communities by saying it had been offering assistance since the first day of the flooding on November 8.</p>
      <p>Part of this had come from the Bellwin scheme, operated by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) to help local councils.</p>
      <p>“Under Bellwin, local authorities dealing with the flooding can apply to have 100% of their eligible costs, above a threshold, reimbursed by the Government. This could be for items including rest centres, temporary accommodation and staff overtime,” the Ministry said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The Ministry said the Government had also activated its Flood Recovery Framework, which helps local authority districts with more than 25 flooded households.</p>
      <p>This frees up funding to give eligible households and businesses “immediate relief” from their council tax and business rates for at least the next three months.</p>
      <p>Towns and villages around Doncaster and Sheffield, and parts of the Midlands have been particularly affected by the heavy downpours.</p>
      <p>In some places, the overnight rain could continue to add to the water levels, and as of 8pm on Friday, there are still 95 flood warnings in place across the regions.</p>
      <p>Ms Roberts explained: “Almost certainly in some places it’s going to exacerbate problems, but it’s not looking particularly heavy or persistent, so it should not be as much.</p>
      <p>“On Saturday, it will still be quite cloudy across parts of England and Wales, particularly central.”</p>
      <p>Herefordshire and Worcestershire Fire and Rescue Service said it had rescued 97 people and a dog in 43 different incidents where vehicles had become stuck in water over Thursday and Friday.</p>

      <p>There was also disruption to some rail services between Sheffield and Scunthorpe, Doncaster and Goole, and Nottingham and Derby.</p>
      <p>On Friday, the Environment Agency (EA) continued to pump water out of Fishlake.</p>
      <p>Army soldiers had been working since Wednesday to lay down sandbags and firm up flood defences in the area and in neighbouring Stainforth, but have since been removed.</p>
      <p>EA spokesman John Curtin said 38 pumps have been used in Fishlake, adding that all houses in the village should be free of water by Sunday.</p>

      <p>Doncaster Council said 970 homes and businesses in the town had been affected since the rain started on November 7.</p>
      <p>On Friday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whose response to the floods has been criticised by some of those affected, announced that the worst-impacted households and businesses would be eligible for immediate relief on their council tax and business rates.</p>
