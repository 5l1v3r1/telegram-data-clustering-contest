      <p>On one or two days, cloudy conditions and moderate to heavy thundery showers can be expected between the late morning and evening.</p>
      <p>The weather is forecast to be slightly cooler compared to past weeks, with the daily minimum temperature expected to reach a low of around 23 degrees Celsius on a few nights.  </p>
      <p>The daily temperature on most days is expected to range between 24 degrees Celsius and 33 degrees Celsius. </p>
      <p>In its weather advisory, the Met Service said that the prevailing inter-monsoon conditions are expected to transition to the northeast monsoon in the second half of November. </p>
      <p>The northeast monsoon season, which is also the rainy season over the southern region of Southeast Asia, is expected to extend into March next year. </p>
      <p>The Met Service added that <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/haze-singapore-unhealthy-range-november-nea-12088930">any occasional slight haziness</a> is expected to be alleviated due to the "gradual strengthening of the northeasterly winds over the equatorial Southeast Asia region". </p>
      <p>On Wednesday morning, hazy conditions were present in Singapore due to an "accumulation of particulate matter".</p>
