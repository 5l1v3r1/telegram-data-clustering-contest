      <p>Tyson Fury will be returning to his Irish roots in the coming days to train with none other than Conor McGregor in Dublin, Ireland, per a recent interview with <a href="https://www.rte.ie/sport/boxing/2019/1114/1090826-fury-mma-training-session-with-mcgregor-imminent/">RTE Radio 1 </a>(h/t <a href="https://themaclife.com/sports/mma/tyson-fury-definitely-coming-dublin-train-conor-mcgregor/">The Mac Life</a>).</p>
      <p>The heavyweight boxing champ has spent the past week <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/9/20956119/video-tyson-fury-train-darren-till-move-mma-dana-white-attention-ufc-news-boxing">learning the basics with top-five UFC middleweight Darren Till</a> in Liverpool, England, after ‘The Gypsy King’ expressed interest in a transition from the world of boxing to mixed martial arts.</p>
      <p>“I’m looking forward to coming to train with Conor. We’re going to get it all planned in and I should be over in Dublin quite soon,” Fury said.</p>
      <p>“I think Conor is an absolutely fantastic fighting man. He has offered to train me if I ever want to go into MMA,” he added. “What better trainer could I have than the Notorious Conor McGregor? I’m looking forward to coming to train with Conor. We’re going to get it all planned in and I should be over in Dublin quite soon.</p>
      <p>“I’ll definitely be coming over for a training session, that is for sure. I have been MMA training in the last week with Darren Till in Liverpool,” Fury added. “I really enjoy the new challenge. I don’t know where or when [I’ll move into MMA] because after I finish my boxing career I fancy my hand at MMA as well.”</p>
      <p>Fury, who is expected to rematch heavy hitting knockout artist Deontay Wilder in the new year, has teased of crossover fights with the likes of Stipe Miocic and Francis Ngannou. Miocic, the reigning UFC heavyweight champion, has told the Irish traveller to be careful what he wishes for.</p>
      <p>As for McGregor, the former UFC dual-division champ is expected to return to the UFC to take on Donald Cerrone in January.</p>
