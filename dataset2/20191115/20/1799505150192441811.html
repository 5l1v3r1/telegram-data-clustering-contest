      <p>WASHINGTON (CN) – After years of court battles, there might finally be an end in sight to the long winding legal fight to uncloak President Donald Trump’s finances. But not before the president, who asked the Supreme Court on Friday to block a lower court order to release his personal financial records to Congress, gears up for a final showdown with House Democrats.</p>
      <p>Jay Sekulow, one of the president’s attorneys, said in a statement Friday afternoon that Trump has filed an application for stay with Chief Justice John Roberts, a George W. Bush appointee. Sekulow said the decision by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta to enforce a subpoena issued by the House Committee on Oversight and Reform was the first time in U.S. history that the judiciary ordered the release of personal records of a sitting president.</p>
      <p>“Those decisions are wrong and should be reversed.  The one thing the district court, the panel and the dissenting judges all agree upon is that this case raises important separation-of-powers issues,” he said. “In light of the significant constitutional issues involved in this case, we are hopeful that the stay will be granted pending the timely filing of a petition for certiorari on behalf of the president.”</p>
