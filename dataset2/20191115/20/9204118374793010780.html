      <p>American Manganese Inc. (AMY; Surrey, B.C., Canada; <a href="http://www.americanmanganeseinc.com/">www.americanmanganeseinc.com</a>) announced the successful recovery of high-purity (99.98%) nickel-cobalt hydroxide from the NCA cathode scrap material received from a tier-one lithium-ion battery (LIB) company. American Manganese plans to announce additional results as they are received and reviewed.</p>
      <p>The laboratory studies were conducted by the Company’s independent contractor, Kemetco Research, to analyze the optimum recycling conditions and produce recycled material for the customer’s evaluation.</p>
      <p>“We designed the process with the goal to produce recycled battery products that could be seamlessly integrated into the re-manufacturing of battery cathodes using minimal processing steps,” said Norm Chow, President of Kemetco Research.</p>
      <p>After continuous improvement and optimization, American Manganese’s  RecycLiCo patented process achieved an even higher purity than the previously reported purity results (99.94%) during stages 3 and 4 of Pilot Plant project, as announced in the company’s <a href="https://americanmanganeseinc.com/american-manganese-inc-reports-pilot-plant-results-of-99-94-purity-from-recovered-nca-cathode-material/">August 27, 2019 press release</a>.</p>
      <p>“The purity results analyzed by Kemetco Research demonstrates the potential of our patented process and sets a new benchmark for the lithium-ion battery recycling industry,” said Larry Reaugh, President and CEO of American Manganese. “We continue to pioneer a high-recovery, high-purity, and environmentally friendly cathode-to-cathode lithium-ion battery recycling solution that promotes a circular economy for the lithium-ion battery supply chain.”</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.recyclico.com/">RecycLiCo</a> patented process is a closed-circuit hydrometallurgical solution for recycling lithium-ion battery material. American Manganese has completed testing of the Pilot Plant project and aims to begin engineering design and economic analysis of a 3-5 ton per day commercial demonstration plant for 2020; following the completion of testing for tier-one companies.
