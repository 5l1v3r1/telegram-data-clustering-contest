      <h1>Review: ‘Dollface’ Aims for #Squadgoals but Comes Up Short</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T20:07:07+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 20:07</time> by <a rel="author">Margaret Lyons</a></address>
      <p>Much of “Dollface” and its critique of contemporary womanhood is barely skin-deep, but it has such a good skin care routine it’s hard to mind. Beyond its festive magical realism, it has almost nothing to say — it’s a “rosé all day” shirt come to life, a show where a desire to go to SantaCon is treated as normal and possibly good. The characters could — should — look at one another and ask, “Why are we friends?”; I should ask the show the same thing. In both cases the answer is, I don’t know … but we are.</p>
      <p>Kat Dennings (“2 Broke Girls”) stars as Jules, who gets dumped within the first five minutes of the pilot and then has to board a bus of weepy women, driven by a humanoid cat who tells her she has neglected her female friendships and needs to rediscover them. It’s the first fantasy the show engages in, and it’s both appealingly imaginative and vaguely contemptuous. Other reality-bending moments include a FOMO game show called “Should She Go Out?,” a dealership for “new and pre-owned dudes,” a chasm opening under a brunch table and a full-on “Wizard of Oz” episode.</p>
      <p>These surreal asides are fun and cheeky, and they sometimes skewer the dumb social constraints of being a woman. But they are also frustratingly imprecise, and when the show goes too long without one, the emotional blankness of Jules’s world becomes too apparent. I devoured the first six episodes in a gleeful blitz, though the subsequent four slowed considerably. (The entire first season arrived Friday on Hulu.) It’s a common affliction in the streaming age that becomes much more noticeable in shows that lack propulsive narratives, like “Dollface.”</p>
      <p>Jules’s boss is dippy, her ex-boyfriend is worthless, her pets are named after “Entourage” characters. Psst, Jules: Maybe you should burn this all down and start fresh.</p>
      <p>Instead of finding a bigger or better life, she does as the Cat Lady tells her. Jules’s new #squad is two friends from college that she accidentally ditched years earlier, Madison and Stella (Brenda Song and Shay Mitchell), and a friend from work (Esther Povitsky). Together they spend most of their time explaining to Jules how the world works. Sleep with this guy, go to this party, keep some secrets but not others.</p>
      <p>Much of the advice is terrible, but that doesn’t seem like the point of the show, or the point of the advice. Women have to stick together! Otherwise who will get all your jokes about women?</p>
      <p>“Dollface” is at its best when it’s taking big swings and at its most disposable when it lapses into sitcom shenanigans, like when Madison pretends she can cook to save face with her much older boyfriend. It’s disappointing to see something so played out play itself out again, especially because “Dollface” can be, at times, so fun and original.</p>
      <p>Jules goes to the doctor, where she hears bad news: She’s caught <i>feelings</i>. “Feelings are always a risk whenever you are sexually active,” the doctor warns her. She’ll need to use protection — “hooking up with at least two other people” — and stay away from the guy for a few weeks. When Jules asks if she should warn him so he doesn’t also contract feelings, the doctor bursts out laughing. “No. Men cannot get this.”</p>
      <p>Would “Dollface” be better if it were meaner, or if it were nicer? I’m still not sure. The cleverly executed cameos  (Dave Coulier, Macaulay Culkin) and tossed-off lines (“the heir to the Capri-Sun fortune”) point toward a welcome prickliness, but the show can’t quite stick to those guns — if it did, Jules would realize how vacuous her existence is. The story’s endorsement of companionship is earnest, but most of the friendships seem unhealthy, and the show pulls away from meaningful intimacy.</p>
      <p>But then again, so do people, and we keep them around anyway. “Dollface” is not B.F.F. material, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t a good time. The vibe is right, the tiny details well observed, and Mitchell’s performance is a treat and a half. Yes, the show can feel like a watered-down “Man Seeking Woman” and “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,” but there are worse things to be.</p>
