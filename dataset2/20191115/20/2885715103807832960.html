      <p>To spread awareness about organ donation and meet the huge gap in demand and supply, AIIMS has developed a QR code that is on display in waiting areas and wards to make it easier for people to pledge their organs.</p>
      <p>“By pledging, the person is not forced to donate organs. But when a person pledges, he talks about it to his family. This way, the family knows about organ donation and at the time of death, they can take a decision easily… We have put the QR code in every waiting area, taking the movement in campaign mode,” Dr Aarti Vij, professor and in-charge of Organ Retrieval Banking Organisation (ORBO) at AIIMS, told <a href="https://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a>.</p>
      <p>According to AIIMS data, in India, around 1.5-2 lakh patients require kidney transplant annually, but only 7,500-8,000 receive it. Around 75,000-80,000 patients require liver transplants annually but only around 1,800 such surgeries are performed.</p>
      <p>ORBO has already started a single-window approach to facilitate organ donation, tissue donation and whole body donation along with brain death donor registry.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan also felicitated families of organ donors at a function organised on the campus. Families of 38 multi-organ donors, five donors who pledged to give up their bodies for medical education and eight tissue donors were felicitated.</p>
      <p>“One donor can save the life of 7-8 patients and enhance the quality of life of 40-50 patients. We need to motivate individuals, families and organisations to pledge to donate organs after death, and to spread awareness about importance of organ donation,” said Dr Vardhan.</p>
      <p>Expressing concern over the huge gap between the demand and supply of organs, Union Minister Kiren Rijiju underlined the importance of creating awareness about the issue.</p>
