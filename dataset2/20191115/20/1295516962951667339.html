      <p>Exactly what movies will occupy those slots isn't known at this time.

It's also possible one or more of these films may see the introduction of the <a href="https://www.cbr.com/marvel-kevin-feige-fantastic-four-x-men-mcu/">Fantastic Four or X-Men</a> into the MCU following Disney's merger with Fox.</p>
