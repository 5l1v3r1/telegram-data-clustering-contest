      <p>We were incredibly impressed at the tail end of October when Todd Phillips’ <b><i>Joker</i> </b>officially became the highest grossing rated “R” movie of all time, and this weekend the film will be reaching an even more incredible landmark. With a $998 million worldwide total at the time of writing this, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2019/11/15/box-office-joker-tops-1-billion/#1d4369249dcd">Forbes reports today</a>, <i>Joker</i> will cross ONE BILLION DOLLARS this weekend.</p>
      <p>Needless to say, the <b>Joaquin Phoenix</b>-starring <i>Joker</i> will be the very first rated “R” movie to hit $1 billion, and it took just over one month for the film to cross that threshold.</p>
      <p>The only other rated “R” movies to even come close are<i> Deadpool</i> and<i> Deadpool 2</i>, both of which finished strong at the box office with just under $800 million each.</p>
      <p>Unadjusted for inflation, comparable comic book films in the billion dollar club include <i>The Dark Knight</i> ($1,004,934,033) and<i> The Dark Knight Rises</i> ($1,081,041,287).</p>
      <p>WB/DC brought <i>Joker</i> to the screen on a production budget of just $62.5 million, allowing for the film to become the most profitable comic book movie of all time.</p>
      <p>What’s next? Sequel? Academy Awards recognition? Only time will tell.</p>
