      <p>Shocking footage shows the moment a cop tackled a 15-year-old quadruple amputee and pinned him to the ground.</p>
      <p>The incident was filmed by another teen inside a group home in Tucson, Arizona in September.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.kold.com/2019/11/14/watch-teenage-quadruple-amputee-wrestled-ground-by-deputy/">KOLD</a> was obtained the video and said the boy, who has amputations on all four limbs, was in the home because he had been abandoned by his family.</p>
      <p>The Pima County Sheriff’s Department deputy was reportedly called to the group home because the teen apparently knocked over a garbage can and verbally threatened a worker in the home.</p>
      <p>At the beginning of the video, the deputy is seen on top of teen, pressing him into a refrigerator.</p>

      <p>The teen is heard screaming ‘get the fuck off of me,’ as the sheriff appears to hold the boy down.</p>

      <p>Later in the video, the deputy is seen shouting at both teens before arresting them, handcuffing the teen who filmed the encounter as he ate a bowl of cereal.</p>
      <p>The second teen puts his hands behind his back as officers arrest him, seemingly giving himself up willingly – but the officer can be seen slamming the boy’s head into a wall as he detained him.</p>
      <p>Both teens were reportedly arrested for disorderly conduct charges and taken to a juvenile detention center.</p>
      <p>KOLD said that they showed the Pima County Sheriff’s Department the video, which they had apparently not seen beforehand.</p>
      <p>The department said they have begun an internal investigation into the incident.</p>
      <p>Local public defender Joel Feinman said: ‘Men with badges should not be acting this way. Men and women who do act this way should not have badges and guns,’ adding that these kind of videos make it to the public.</p>
