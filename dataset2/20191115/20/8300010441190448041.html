      <p>LONG BEACH, California (KABC) -- "Do you want to pet my dog?" Cindy Fitzpatrick asked travelers at the Long Beach Airport with her 7-year-old German Shepherd, Zuba, by her side.<br/><br/>Fitzpatrick and Zuba are part of the Long Beach Airport's new dog therapy program, STARS, that debuted on October 30.<br/><br/>"It stands for 'Simple Therapy and Real Smiles,'" said the airport's Public Affairs Assistant, Kimberly McMahon. "The reaction has been amazing."<br/><br/>The purpose of the program is to provide a chance for travelers and airport employees to de-stress.<br/><br/>"A lot of people have anxiety and when you're running late, it's great to have a dog and the opportunity to mellow out a little before you have to go on the plane," said Lori Jensen from Irvine.<br/><br/>There are 9 certified therapy dogs currently in the STARS program, and a wait list of other therapy dogs and handlers who want to get involved.<br/><br/><b>Follow Rachel on social media:<br/><a href="https://www.facebook.com/abc7rachel">Facebook.com/abc7rachel</a><br/><a href="https://twitter.com/abc7rachel">Twitter.com/abc7rachel</a><br/><a href="https://www.instagram.com/abc7rachel/">Instagram.com/abc7rachel</a></b></p>
