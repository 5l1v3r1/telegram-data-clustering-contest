      <h1>House Democrats slap EPA with a subpoena over chemical risk program documents</h1>

      <p>The Environmental Protection Agency is facing a subpoena from House Science Committee Democrats as a tense back-and-forth over one of the agency’s chemical risk programs escalates.</p>
      <p>House Science Committee Chairwoman Eddie Bernice Johnson, a Texas Democrat, issued the subpoena Friday, according to the agency, following through on threats made last month. Johnson is seeking documents she says the EPA has been holding back related to Trump officials' decisions to reorganize its Integrated Risk Information System, which studies the risks chemicals pose to human health.</p>
      <p>The EPA insists that it has been transparent with House Science Committee Democrats and has offered a top political official, David Dunlap, for a briefing. Dunlap, one of the EPA’s top science officials and a former Koch Industries official, is at the center of the controversy.</p>
      <p>“As someone who’s been on the other side of this before, there is a process for doing and responding to congressional oversight, and we were engaged in that process, that back-and-forth iterative process,” a senior EPA official told the <i>Washington Examiner</i>. “We were negotiating with them in good faith, providing them with offers that were never responded to.”</p>
      <p>“The committee has chosen, quite frankly, an unreasonable and unwarranted nuclear option that I can only surmise is a political investigation rather than a pursuit of the truth,” the official added.</p>
