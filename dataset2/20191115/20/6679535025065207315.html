      <p>Two Dwarka residents were allegedly duped by a gang of fraudsters on the pretext of updating their Know Your Customer (KYC) documents on an e-commerce payment system.</p>
      <p>A 69-year-old former government employee from Dwarka, Atul Thakur, said he had on Wednesday received a call from a man stating that his KYC documents for Paytm need to be updated.</p>
      <p>“I have been using Paytm for a year now and updating KYC documents seemed like a familiar process because they have to be submitted for bank accounts and other such applications as well. When I asked him about the procedure, he said he would explain it to me over the phone,” Mr. Thakur said.</p>
      <p>The man had asked the victim to first transfer ₹1 from his bank account to his Paytm account, which he did. After this, he was told to download another application — Quick Support — to help him update the documents. “I downloaded the app. I suspect that the man could remotely access my phone. He then asked me to add another bank account and make another transaction of ₹1,” Mr. Thakur said.</p>
      <p>Within a few minutes, the complainant received a message that ₹49,000 had been added to his Patym wallet from his bank account. Next, he received messages stating that in three transactions — ₹20,000, ₹20,000 and ₹9,400 — the money had gone from his Paytm wallet to his Paytm bank account. The money was then transferred in two transactions of ₹24,500 and ₹25,000 to two different accounts, which were not operated by the victim.</p>
      <p>Mr. Thakur then immediately called Paytm customer care and reported the matter. He said he has not heard from them after they gave him a complaint number. He then reported the matter to the police after which a case was registered on charges of cheating in Dwarka North police station.</p>
      <h3>Duped of over ₹2lakh</h3>
      <p>With a similar complaint, Abhinav Pandey from Golf Links Residence in Dwarka Sector 23, approached the police stating that he had been cheated of ₹2,46,797.</p>
      <p>A senior officer said teams are working to identify the accused.</p>
      <p>Sources said it is suspected that the gang has targeted several others using the same modus operandi.</p>
