      <p>CAIRO: A date for Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah’s return to action remains unclear with an ankle injury rumored to be more serious than at first thought.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old Egyptian star has been ruled out of his country’s upcoming international games and is a doubt for the Reds next Premier League match against Crystal Palace on Nov. 23.</p>
      <p>Salah originally suffered the injury in league leaders Liverpool’s 2-1 win over Leicester City on Oct. 5, hobbling off the pitch at Anfield after coming under a second-half challenge from Foxes midfielder Hamza Choudhury.</p>
      <p>The injury seemingly got worse during his side’s 3-1 home win over rivals Manchester City following a tackle by Brazilian midfielder Fernandinho.</p>
      <p>The player was consequently withdrawn from the African qualifiers against Kenya and Comoros and was seen wearing a protective boot on his left foot as he sat out a national team training session in Cairo.</p>
      <p>There has been speculation that the No. 11 could be out for up to four weeks, which if true would mean Salah might be unavailable for Liverpool’s next six games, including the final two group fixtures in the Champions League.</p>
      <p>That would not be good news for Liverpool who will be eager for him to play against Crystal Palace. In the bigger scheme of things, the club is hoping to ensure he stays fit enough to maintain his key role in Jurgen Klopp’s attack.</p>
      <p>Being one of the world’s best players, Salah is an essential cog for club and country. The only Premier League game he has sat out for Liverpool this season, away to Manchester United, is the only match the Reds have failed to win.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, when Egypt surprisingly drew 1-1 with Kenya at home, the Pharaohs seemed affected by the absence of the influential Salah, falling short against a team 108th in FIFA rankings, 60 places behind Egypt.</p>
      <p>The obvious conclusion is that when Salah is playing and is fit, Liverpool and Egypt’s chances of winning games and championships are markedly increased. </p>
      <p>When he is not on the pitch, the odds of being triumphant noticeably decrease.</p>
      <p>Football is a rough, physical contact sport. Sprains and strains are part of the game. </p>
      <p>But pain relief sprays do not always fix the problem. </p>
      <p>While Salah will be told to keep his ankle elevated and stay off it whenever possible, these instructions may not be the complete panacea.</p>
      <p>Rest is usually the best medicine for injuries. However, in international cut-throat football, being out of action for long stretches is not an option.</p>
      <p>Klopp and Liverpool fans desperately want to successfully defend their Champions League title. </p>
      <p>They would also relish a Premier League crown, especially after losing out by a one-point whisker to Manchester City last season.</p>
      <p>The title is this season within Liverpool’s grasp with them currently topping the table on 34 points after 12 games, eight ahead of Leicester City and Chelsea, and with a nine-point gap on Manchester City. It is almost 30 years since Liverpool last won the league. </p>
      <p>If Salah does miss half-a-dozen games, it would indicate his injury is worse than originally thought. </p>
      <p>Apart from the infamous tackle with Spanish ace Sergio Ramos that left his shoulder with sprained ligaments when he hit the ground, and a collision with Newcastle United goalkeeper Martin Dubravka that resulted in concussion, Salah is not a regular face in the injury room.</p>
      <p>He has only sat out one match through injury during two-and-a-half years playing at Anfield and didn’t miss a game for the Reds in last season’s Premier League campaign, only being used as a substitute once.</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen whether Salah will be fit for the trip to Selhurst Park. Klopp clearly has options to rotate if his Egyptian star is unavailable. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Divock Origi have both filled roles in the attack this season, while Swiss winger Xherdan Shaqiri is expected back from injury after the international break.</p>
      <p>But Salah is a hard act for anyone to follow. The forward has nine goals in 17 appearances in all competitions for the Reds this term. However, common sense dictates that if Salah is not completely fit and Klopp has alternatives, then it would be wise not to play him. Playing with an injury produces short-term gain but could lead to long-term pain.</p>
      <p>At least Liverpool are not hiding Salah’s injury, as they apparently did with Andy Robertson, the full-back whose ankle injury kept him out of the Scotland squad amid a news blackout on his condition.</p>
      <p>Salah’s injury is not a secret; however, it is the extent of the injury which is creating concerns. Injuries that do not heal properly can end careers.</p>
      <p>It is understood Salah has been given the chance to train away from Liverpool’s Melwood training ground as he continues his rehabilitation, and the club will grant him an extended period of time off over the international break. </p>
      <p>The club is limiting his involvement in training and providing regular treatment.</p>
      <p>Up to now Liverpool have been playing it safe and not risking their prized possession. </p>
      <p>But the temptation to rush Salah back before he is fully fit is surely strong. In that case, the club should ask itself how many players, footballers and otherwise, have had their time on fields and courts come to a premature end due to injury?</p>
      <p>The Premier League — like life — is full of hard knocks. </p>
      <p>But there’s a difference between injuries that are treatable and those that are career threatening.</p>
      <p>It is best for all concerned that Salah forfeits some football now rather than stop playing forever.</p>
