      <h1>Texas parole board recommends delaying Rodney Reed execution</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T20:39:36+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 20:39</time> by <a rel="author">Louis Casiano</a></address>
      <p>The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles recommended Friday that the state delay the execution of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/michael-baden-death-row-rodney-reed-innocent">Rodney Reed</a>, amid calls by supporters and celebrities to reexamine his <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime">conviction</a> because of new evidence.</p>
      <p>The board unanimously recommended a 120-day reprieve for Reed, who is set to receive a lethal injection on Wednesday for the 1996 killing of a 19-year-old woman.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/texas-michael-mccaul-ted-cruz-greg-abbott-rodney-reed">Gov. Greg Abbott</a>, a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/senate/republicans">Republican</a>, will decide whether to accept the board's recommendation. The board has recommended commuting a death sentence only five times since 1982.</p>

      <p>Abbott has halted one imminent execution, in 2018, in his four years in office.</p>
      <p>Reed has received an <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/rodney-reed-kim-kardashian-rihanna-texas-death-row">outpouring of support</a> from big names such as Beyoncé, Kim Kardashian and Oprah, and from <a href="https://mccaul.house.gov/sites/mccaul.house.gov/files/Reed%20Letter%20-%20McCaul.pdf">lawmakers</a> from both parties.</p>
      <p>Reed, 51, has maintained his innocence in connection with the abduction, rape and strangulation of Stacy Stites. Her body was found in 1996 on the side of a road southeast of Austin.</p>
      <p>Reed was arrested nearly a year later after his DNA surfaced in an unrelated <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/sex-crimes">sexual assault</a>; he was sentenced to death in 1998.</p>
      <p>His lawyers and supporters argue that new evidence points to Stites' fiance, a former police officer named Jimmy Fennell, who was a suspect in the original investigation. Reed said Fennell, who is white, was angry she was having an affair with Reed, who is black.</p>

      <p>Prosecutors said Reed's semen was found in Stites and that his claims of an affair were not proven at trial. They said Fennell was cleared as a suspect and that Reed had a history of sexual assaults.</p>

      <p>Fennell was paroled last year after serving prison time for sexual assault. Reed's lawyers argue his conviction was based on false evidence, and they denied sexual assault allegations.</p>
      <p>Reed has several appeals pending, including one to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
