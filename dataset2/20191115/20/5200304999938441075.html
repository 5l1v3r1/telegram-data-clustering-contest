      <p>While there have been rumours about Ajay Devgn’s next being a remake of one of his previous films, it’s now being said that the actor will be joining hands with Anees Bazmee for the remake of of his 2002 thriller ‘Deewangee’.</p>
      <p>The film saw Devgn in a double role. Bazmee confirmed the news to <i>Deccan Chronicle</i>, “Ajay has been telling me to remake Deewangee for a long time now because the film was so good and different. Many times, people come to me and suggest to work on that film. It was my first suspense film and very different from what I have been doing over the years, which is why I am thinking about remaking Deewangee”.</p>
      <p>Bazmee went on to say, “After so many years, the character will be more mature and strong. I am working on plotting a good story that suits the character, and Ajay will be my actor to play the role in the remake”.</p>
      <p>The film also starred Urmila Matondkar.</p>
