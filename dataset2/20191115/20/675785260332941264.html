      <p>A council has been slammed after splashing out £30,000 on gates outside offices to deter rough sleepers.</p>
      <p>Wrexham County Borough Council  bosses claim they put up the black metal gates at its Guildhall HQ and offices after complaints about anti-social behaviour from the public.</p>
      <p>But "shocked"  campaigners from homeless charity Shelter said the money should have been spent helping the homeless not stigmatising them.</p>
      <p>A Shelter Cymru spokesman said: “Shelter Cymru believes that you cannot “design out homelessness" .</p>
      <p>"The use of hostile architecture in certain spaces chimes with a wider intolerance of people sleeping rough. It sends a message to people who are vulnerable and in desperate situations that they are not wanted. At the most all it achieves is to push a visible issue out of sight.</p>
      <p>"We believe that everyone is entitled to a safe, secure and affordable home.</p>

      <p>"The resources spent on designing, installing and maintaining these barriers would be better spent on addressing the root causes of homelessness to prevent it from occurring in the first place; and ensuring that where it does occur, meaningful solutions are on offer."</p>
      <p>The Wrexham Homeless group has also reacted with fury to the council's decision.</p>
      <p>A spokesman said he was "shocked" by the move, adding: "Wouldn't it be better spent tackling the issues instead of putting up gates.</p>
      <p>He said: "l am sure the £30,000 could be better spent by facing the issues and dealing with them in the correct manner."</p>
      <p>"Other towns have done similar things and all it does is move the problem to another areas and make it very unsafe for vulnerable people exposing them to attacks. </p>
      <p>"Many street people are vulnerable and congregate in such areas because they are well lit and busy through the night .</p>
      <p>"Erecting gates will make these people even more vulnerable, removing shelter and a place of relative safety. It is very unfortunate that Wrexham council chooses to spend this amount of money in this way.</p>
      <p>"That could go towards some emergency accommodation or supporting street people in an empty building over the winter, of which Wrexham has many."</p>
      <p>But a Wrexham resident said: "Its about time. They have put them there to stop the homeless sleeping there.</p>
      <p>"I have seen all kinds of mess outside the building including human faeces, it was disgusting.</p>
      <p>"It looks a lot better now and I don't have concerns about the cost, it had to be done."</p>
      <p>Despite the fierce criticism the council has defended its decision.</p>
      <p>Ian Bancroft, chief executive of the council said: "The issue of installing fencing was due to a specific problem of rough sleepers and was taken forward as a result of complaints from the public due to anti-social behaviour and the issue of risk to staff and public.</p>
      <p>"This work has been done alongside the actions taken to support individuals into sustainable housing solutions."</p>
      <p>Wrexham is still struggling with a homeless problem and has the highest number of homeless deaths in Wales.</p>
