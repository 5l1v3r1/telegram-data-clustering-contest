      <p>Expediting the process of giving legal status to unauthorised colonies, the Delhi Development Authority will start uploading maps of such colonies on its website from Monday onwards, DDA vice-chairperson Tarun Kapoor said.</p>
      <p>“We have readied maps of 500 colonies, but in the first phase, only 50 will be uploaded on the website. The rest will be uploaded in batches of 50. The RWAs can thereafter make objections or suggestions on them,” he said.</p>
      <p>Boundaries of 1,728 unauthorised colonies in the capital are supposed to be mapped.</p>
