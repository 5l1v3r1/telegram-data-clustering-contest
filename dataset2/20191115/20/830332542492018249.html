      <p>DECATUR, Ala. (AP) - Whooping cranes are back at a national wildlife refuge in Alabama.</p>
      <p>The International Crane Foundation said Friday that, for the second year in a row, wild-hatched chick W7-17 was the first to arrive at the Wheeler National Wildlife Refuge in Decatur. The two-year-old arrived Nov. 9.</p>
      <p>She's among about 100 whoopers in a flock taught to migrate from Wisconsin to Florida by following ultralight aircraft.</p>
      <p>Crane foundation outreach assistant A.J. Binney says about one-third of them winter in Alabama. So do about 20,000 sandhill cranes.</p>
      <p>A tracking map shows about 14 whooping cranes at the refuge.</p>
      <p>The refuge website says whoopers have been seen around the visitor center and wildlife observation building in recent years.</p>
      <p>The refuge's annual Festival of the Cranes will be Jan. 11-12 at the visitor center.</p>
