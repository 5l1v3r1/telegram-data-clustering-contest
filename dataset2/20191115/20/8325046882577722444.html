      <h3>When do Target’s Black Friday deals start?</h3>
      <p>Target will again give <a href="http://goto.target.com/c/196318/81938/2092?subId1=biip_102219_black-friday-target-deals&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fredcard%2Fabout">RedCard holders</a> early access to shop more than 100 deals all day on Wednesday, November 27. Members of <a href="https://circle.target.com/dashboard">Target Circle</a> (the company’s free loyalty program) will reportedly get early access at 6 p.m. CT on November 27. For everyone else, Target Black Friday deals became available on Thanksgiving morning.</p>
      <p>Target released its <a href="http://goto.target.com/c/196318/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Ftarget-black-friday%2F-%2FN-5q0f2%3Fref%3Dsr_shorturl_blackfriday">Black Friday ad</a> on November 6, so we at least know some of what will be on sale.</p>
      <h3>Will Target be open on Thanksgiving?</h3>
      <p>Yes. Target will be open for an eight-hour shift from 5 p.m. to 1 a.m. on Thanksgiving Day like <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/target-black-friday-hours-earliest-ever-2018-11">it was last year</a>. Doors close at 1 a.m. and re-open again at 7 a.m. on Friday, November 29.</p>
      <h3>Does Target allow in-store pick-up?</h3>
      <p>Sometimes, but you may not want to count on it. There are certain items that will be eligible for in-store pickup, but not likely everything you’ll want to buy.</p>
      <h3>What is Target’s return policy?</h3>
      <p>For items purchased from November 1 – December 25, the 30-day return period will start on December 26. As usual, RedCard holders have a longer returns window.</p>
      <h3>Is Target price-matching during Black Friday?</h3>
      <p>No. Target will price-match between its online and in-store prices, but not with competitors.</p>
      <p>However, Target will likely keep prices as close to competitors as possible, and most major retailers tend to adjust prices throughout the day to remain competitive. You just won’t have 14 days to ask for a differential refund if you come across something lower.</p>
      <h3>Will RedCard holders still get 5% off purchases at Target on Black Friday?</h3>
      <p>Yes. They’ll also get early access to over 100 Black Friday deals on November 27.</p>
      <h3>Are there any ways to save even more at Target on Black Friday?</h3>
      <p>As mentioned, it certainly doesn’t hurt to be a <a href="http://goto.target.com/c/196318/81938/2092?subId1=biip_102219_black-friday-target-deals&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Fredcard-program-rules%2F-%2FN-4tgj0">RedCard holder</a>. They typically get early access to the deals, and they get an extra 5% off their purchases. You’ll also get free shipping with no minimum. If you make purchases with a Target Debit Card, Credit Card, or Target Mastercard (all RedCards) you also get an <a href="http://goto.target.com/c/196318/81938/2092?subId1=biip_102219_black-friday-target-deals&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Fredcard-program-rules%2F-%2FN-4tgj0">additional 30 days to return</a> a purchase.</p>
      <p>You can also get early access for free by joining <a href="https://circle.target.com/dashboard">Target Circle</a>, the retailer’s free loyalty program.</p>
      <p>The benefits may be slim in comparison, but it also doesn’t hurt to download <a href="http://goto.target.com/c/196318/81938/2092?subId1=biip_102219_black-friday-target-deals&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Ftarget-app%2F-%2FN-4th2r%3Fclkid%3Db2bbee8eN4cab11e99da50a0f8e449c39%26lnm%3D79373%26afid%3Ddealnews%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002">the Target app</a>. Retailers with apps are known to push specific coupons or exclusive discounts to those with it downloaded already or to incentivize downloads.</p>
      <p>And while it pays to get early access to avoid sellouts, Target is offering incentives for shopping on Black Friday, too. Shoppers who spend $50 (in-store or online) on November 29 get a 20% off coupon to redeem online or in stores December 3 through December 14.</p>
      <p>In terms of strategy, the best plan is to have a plan. Make a wish-list of what you’d like to buy day-of by clicking the heart on a Target product. When Black Friday deals open to the public, shop your wish-list and don’t get lost browsing. And prioritize whatever is most likely to sell out first.</p>
      <h3>What will be on sale at Target for Cyber Monday?</h3>
