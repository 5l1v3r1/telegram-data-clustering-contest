      <h3>"I would cry every single morning"</h3>
      <p>Bella Hadid has opened up about how her mental health was affected by the rise of her modeling career at such a young age. On Friday, Hadid shared intimate details when she appeared at the <i>Vogue</i> Fashion Festival in Paris, <a href="https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/bella-hadid-never-felt-powerful-in-victorias-secret-shows-1203371806/?cx_testId=5&amp;cx_testVariant=cx_1&amp;cx_artPos=1#cxrecs_s">speaking on the high pressure that came with her sudden arc to success</a>.</p>

      <p>"For a while I just didn't want to talk about it, and I've gone through a lot in the past few years with my health," she said, per a report by <a href="https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/bella-hadid-never-felt-powerful-in-victorias-secret-shows-1203371806/?cx_testId=5&amp;cx_testVariant=cx_1&amp;cx_artPos=1#cxrecs_s">WWD</a>. "I feel guilty for being able to live this incredible life, have the opportunities that I do, but somehow still be depressed. It doesn't make sense."</p>
      <p>She specifically called back to when her career really took off — she made her New York Fashion Week debut for Desigual in 2014, just a month shy of her 18th birthday — during which her mental state was at its worst. She stated, "I would cry every single morning, I would cry during my lunch breaks, I would cry before I slept. I was very emotionally unstable for a while when I was working 14-hour days for four months straight as an 18-year-old. I think I just wanted to breathe a little bit. And so it kind of put me in a spiral."</p>
      <p>At another point during the event, Hadid spoke on her experience walking for Savage X Fenty, saying it was "the first time on a runway that I felt really sexy." Though Hadid does not mention Victoria's Secret by name, she compares the feeling of walking for Fenty to her other lingerie work, which <a href="https://nylon.com/articles/bella-hadid-the-weekend-victorias-secret-fashion-show-2016">notably included</a> the <a href="https://nylon.com/victorias-secret-fashion-show-canceled">now-defunct televised runway show</a>, adding, "When I first did <a href="https://wwd.com/tag/fenty/">Fenty</a>, I was doing other lingerie shows and I never felt powerful on a runway, like, in my underwear."</p>
