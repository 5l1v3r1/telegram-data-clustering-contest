      <p>NEW YORK (WSVN) — New York City is reportedly about to implement a program that would offer gifts for freed defendants in an effort to get them to make their court dates.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/07/gift-cards-cell-phones-and-mets-tickets-how-nyc-spends-12m-enticing-criminals-back-to-court/">New York Post</a>, the $12 million city program will offer defendants items to help prevent them from missing court dates, like toiletries, socks, coffee, cellphones, minutes and single-ride MetroCards.</p>
      <p>However, other items reportedly being offered include gift cards to restaurants, movie tickets and other items for teen defendants like tickets to a Mets game and to the Intrepid Sea, Air &amp; Space Museum.</p>
      <p>A mayoral spokesperson told the New York Post that the baseball tickets were donated.</p>
      <p>Officials said the items are not meant to reward bad behavior, but instead, they serve as a cost-effective measure to ensure officers and marshals don’t have to search for defendants.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2019/11/04/nyc-to-offer-mets-tickets-doughnut-gift-cards-to-get-freed-inmates-back-in-court-after-state-ends-cash-bail/">WCBS</a>, the office of Mayor Bill de Blasio said substantial research shows offering defendants incentives, instead of sanctions, encourages good behavior.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/money/new-york-city-gifting-alleged-criminals-baseball-tickets-gift-cards-as-part-of-12m-perk-program">FOX News</a> De Blasio said at an unrelated press conference Wednesday the incentive program “has been worked on by experts over time and proven to work, proven to be a good investment.”</p>
      <p>The program goes into effect on Jan. 1, along with the city’s new bail reform program.</p>
