        <li>Supermarket sushi is usually far from gourmet.</li>
        <li>But when I <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wegmans-food-options-sushi-burger-salad-fries-2019-11">sampled all the fresh food</a> at the new <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/wegmans">Wegmans</a> supermarket in Brooklyn, the sushi absolutely blew me away.</li>
        <li>With its generous cuts of fresh, high-quality fish for supermarket prices, I’d go back to Wegmans again and again, just for its sushi.</li>

      <p>One doesn’t expect much from a box of supermarket sushi.</p>
      <p>Along with gas stations and convenience stores, supermarkets don’t inspire much confidence when it comes to the quality of their raw fish.</p>
      <p>But Wegmans is all about shattering expectations of what a supermarket can offer. I’m no sushi expert, but I do love a nice hunk of raw fish on some vinegary rice now and then. Maybe slap on some seaweed. My price range is cheap to medium-cheap sushi, so it’s not like I’ve had the of top-of-the-line stuff. This is the review of a sushi lover who can’t really afford to love sushi.</p>
      <p>I recently made my <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wegmans-grocery-store-first-time-review-2019-11">first sojourn</a> to the family-owned supermarket chain Wegmans, a New England cult favorite that opened its first New York location in September. After traipsing through aisles filled with affordable quality goods, I ended my trip with a five-course <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wegmans-food-options-sushi-burger-salad-fries-2019-11">food court fiesta</a> culminating in, of course, sushi.</p>

      <h3>The sushi fridge was filled with rolls, nigiri, sashimi, and even tataki — a high-end touch. Chefs will make you fresh sushi if you ask, but I was impatient.</h3>

      <h3>Real wasabi is so expensive it’s almost never served at American sushi restaurants. Wegmans clearly takes pride that it does serve it.</h3>

      <p>At most American sushi restaurants, the “wasabi” isn’t made out of Japanese horseradish. It’s usually made with cheaper kinds of horseradish and green dye.</p>

      <h3>This is in line with Wegmans’ ethos, which is very focused on local and sustainable food. Its Japanese culinary team is stacked with Japanese culinary talent.</h3>

      <h3>I’d only had uni once before at a Japanese restaurant, and it tasted like trash water. But this uni was delicate, subtle, and reminiscent of sea foam.</h3>

      <h3>I cleaned my plate. At $21, it wasn’t cheap. But it was incredible value for the caliber of sushi I was getting. Next time when I crave some raw fish, I might skip the restaurants and just head to my local Wegmans.</h3>
