        <b>Heartfelt tributes have been paid to an "extremely kind" Clacton vet who died in a crash.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Susan McCann was cycling in London Road, Thorpe-ale-Soken, near White Hall Academy and the Esso petrol station when she was involved in a collision with a lorry on the morning of October 8.</p>
      <p>The 49-year-old died at the scene of the crash.</p>
      <p>Kinfauns Veterinary Centre manager, Ange Hoy, paid tribute to her colleague.</p>
      <p>Miss Hoy said: "Susan was extremely kind-natured and had a wicked sense of humour.</p>
      <p>"Her bubbly character meant everyone liked her and her passing leaves a massive hole in the practice.</p>
      <p>"She dedicated her life to the veterinary world and was popular with clients because of the care she gave their pets.</p>
      <p>"Everyone at the practice has been devastated by the news and we send our condolences to her sister, Maureen and aunt, Teresa."</p>
      <p>Miss Hoy said that Ms McCann was extremely popular with colleagues and clients.</p>
      <p>She grew up in East Kilbride in Scotland but worked in Essex for many years, living in Thorpe-le-Soken near Clacton.</p>
      <p>She attended the University of Glasgow, qualifying as a vet in 1993, and was closely involved in the Essex Veterinary Society and served as their president.</p>
