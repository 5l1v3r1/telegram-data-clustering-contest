      <h1>C-SPAN impeachment caller says he'd ask Yovanovitch if 'she's aware that Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself'</h1>

      <p>A C-SPAN caller said on live television that the one question he would ask former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch is whether "she's aware that Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself."</p>
      <p>The man, a Louisiana Republican named Jared, called in to talk about the election in his home state and to discuss Friday's House impeachment hearing during a break in testimony. Jared said he thought President Trump's Thursday visit to the state will "absolutely" make a difference for Republican gubernatorial candidate Eddie Rispone.</p>
      <p>The call ended with Jared telling the host he wanted to ask Yovanovitch about Epstein.</p>
      <p>"I'd ask her if she's aware that Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself," he said.</p>
      <p>The phrase "Epstein didn't kill himself" has become a mix between a conspiracy theory and a meme, with several cases of people blurting out the line during recent nationally televised interviews. For example, Mike Ritland, a former Navy SEAL, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/watch-fox-host-cracks-up-as-guest-utters-epstein-didnt-kill-himself">said the phrase</a> on Fox News' <i>Watters' World</i> earlier this month. A University of Alabama student also uttered it last week <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/watch-msnbc-ignores-alabama-student-who-says-jeffrey-epstein-didnt-kill-himself-on-live-tv">during an MSNBC interview</a>.</p>
      <p>Epstein, 66, was found dead in his New York prison cell in August <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/jeffrey-epstein-commits-suicide">from an apparent suicide</a>. Since his death, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/jeffrey-epstein-brother-he-was-innocent-and-did-not-kill-himself">people have questioned</a> the circumstances along with his autopsy findings. The previously convicted sex offender had been accused of <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/epstein-used-austrian-passport-with-fake-name-in-the-1980s-prosecutors">sex trafficking dozens of women</a> when they were minors.</p>
