      <p>Batiste added that the vehicle reached speels of between 90 and 100 miles per hour during the chase, the station reported.</p>
      <p>Troopers deployed spike strips to deflate the speeding suspect’s tires, according to the station.</p>
      <p>Batiste told the station the SUV then crashed near a mall and the driver and a passenger got out and tried to run. They were caught a short time later. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.</p>
