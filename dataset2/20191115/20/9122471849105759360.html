      <h1>Joe Lunardi Updates ESPN Bracketology After Chaotic Start To Season</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T20:44:33+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 20:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>Three NCAA blue bloods suffered their first loss of the season in the very first week of the 2019-20 college basketball season last week. It has had a huge effect on the latest edition of ESPN Bracketology.</p>
      <p>No. 1 Michigan State and No. 2 Kansas both lost their season-openers to Kentucky and Duke respectively. Then, after claiming the No. 1 ranking for themselves, Kentucky suffered the first huge upset of the season, <a href="https://thespun.com/college-hoops/upset-alert-kentucky-evansville-game">getting upset at home by Evansville</a>.</p>
      <p>As of now, it looks like the top of the upcoming polls will have a strong ACC flavor. Duke, Louisville, North Carolina and Virginia emerged from the week undefeated, and will all be ranked in the top ten next week.</p>
      <p>Today, ESPN’s Joe Lunardi updated his Bracketology to coincide with some of the big results.</p>
      <p>It may be early in the season, but the teams that lost all have plenty of time to reassert themselves in the months to come.</p>
      <p>Here is what the top four seed lines look like, from <a href="http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/bracketology">ESPN</a>:</p>
      <p>
        <b>East Region (New York City):</b>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Duke</li>
        <li>Ohio State</li>
        <li>Oregon</li>
        <li>Villanova</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <b>Midwest Region (Indianapolis):</b>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Louisville</li>
        <li>Kentucky</li>
        <li>Maryland</li>
        <li>Seton Hall</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <b>South Region (Houston):</b>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Michigan State</li>
        <li>North Carolina</li>
        <li>Texas Tech</li>
        <li>Florida</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <b>West Region (Los Angeles):</b>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Kansas</li>
        <li>Virginia</li>
        <li>Gonzaga</li>
        <li>Arizona</li>
      </ol>
      <p>That’s a pretty compelling list of teams to be sure. Half of those teams have made at least one Final Four appearance in the last three years alone. They’ve also combined for seven of the last ten NCAA titles (eight if we count Louisville’s vacated 2013 title).</p>
      <p>But the season is still very young and the past few years have taught us that a good start is little indicator of how the top teams will finish.</p>
      <p>The NCAA Tournament is four months away, but the contenders are slowly beginning to make their presence known.</p>
