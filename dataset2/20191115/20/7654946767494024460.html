      <p>South Alabama has a good combination of transfers and returning players, which has led to this team getting off to a 2-1 start with the loss coming by a single point on the road against Auburn.</p>
      <p>The Jaguars have four players averaging at least 10 points per game, with the leader being 6-foot-7 combo player Josh Ajayi. The all-Sun Belt performer from a year ago is averaging 19.3 points and 9.7 rebounds per game this season and is a career 37.9 percent 3-point shooter.</p>
      <p>South Alabama on Friday night visits Chattanooga, which lost its top three scorers and is relying upon former Vanderbilt and Notre Dame dual threat Matt Ryan. The 6-foot-8 Ryan is a career 35.9 recent 3-point shooter and is averaging 15.7 points and 4.7 rebounds per game, but is shooting just 33.3 percent from the floor this season.</p>
      <p>Ryan’s struggles from the floor has been the theme of this whole team as the Mocs rank 333rd in the country in field-goal shooting percentage with each of its top four scorers shooting 42.1 percent or lower from the floor.</p>
      <p>South Alabama has been great at denying open looks with 19 blocks in three games, which ranks 17th in the country. Transfers Andre Fox and Chad Lott are combining for 27.3 points and 10 rebounds per game and will help Ajayi put away the Mocs in this one.</p>
      <p><b>The play:</b> South Alabama, -4 ¹/₂ .</p>
