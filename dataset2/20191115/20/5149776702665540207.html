      <p>Fans have wasted no time in taking the opportunity to give their thoughts on <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a>’s latest plans for the City Ground as part of the £100m project.</p>
      <p>More than 1,000 people have already offered feedback to the club since new images were revealed on Friday morning, whetting the appetite of what the stadium will look like once it’s finished.</p>
      <p>The club hope to start work on <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-reveal-amazing-new-3540790">redeveloping the Peter Taylor Stand</a> in the New Year, and say around 5,000 seats could in place for the start of next season, therefore minimising disruption to existing ticket holders.</p>
      <p>“When we went out to the construction market and spoke to a number of contractors, we gave them a couple of challenges,” Tom Cartledge, lead architect and CEO of Benoy <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-city-ground-redevelopment-3541269">told Nottinghamshire Live</a>.</p>
      <p>“One was to deliver the vision and not water that down. But also, one was to look at the programme of work.</p>
      <p>“Very quickly we started to look at a 15-month programme.</p>

      <p>“That is 15 months from the moment the first seat is taken out of the old Peter Taylor Stand - the demolition through to the completion of everything within the main new stand.</p>
      <p>“What we’re also looking at doing is trying to bring forward, within that 15-month period, a number of seats.</p>
      <p>“If we look at the mathematics, there are about 6,000 or 5,500 seats at the moment in the Peter Taylor Stand.</p>
      <p>“We’d like to get those 5,500 back open again as quick as possible to make sure we mitigate the challenges of relocating people around the ground and other things.</p>
      <p>"That, of course, is first and foremost in many people’s minds.</p>
      <p>“What we’re looking to try and do is get that down, far less than a season and certainly not one, two, three or four seasons, which you will have heard of other stories in the past.</p>
      <p>“But we’ll be slightly dictated to by how we build the stand, and that may be impacted by planning. But very much our ambition is to try to reduce that period.”</p>
