      <h2>Latest Aston Villa news includes AVFC response to VAR issue</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T20:00:54+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 20:00</time> by <a rel="author">Shane Ireland, https://www.facebook.com/ShaneIrelandJournalist</a></address>
      <p>Aston Villa are fully aware of fans’ frustrations over VAR – but there’s little they can do to improve the lack of clarity for supporters inside Villa Park.</p>
      <p>VAR has sparked controversy almost every weekend since its introduction into the Premier League at the start of the season.</p>
      <p>One the main complaints has been that fans inside the stadium are often left in the dark about what is going in with little communication about decisions that are being checked.</p>
      <p>A message is displayed on the big screen saying that a check is underway – but there is no more information given until the final decision is displayed.</p>

      <p>The issue came up at the recent <a href="https://astonvilla.vitalfootball.co.uk/all-the-answers-from-aston-villa-via-the-fcg-consultation-meeting/">Fans Consultation Group Meeting</a> with one supporter asking: “How much of what we see on the big screens about VAR checks is down to the club? As a paying customer I’d be really grateful if I had a clue what was going on during these checks and, indeed, I’d be grateful if I knew that they were actually taking place.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> responded by explaining that any updates that can be displayed are sent to the club by the Premier League as VAR is consulted.</p>
      <p>“Fans will know that VAR is under review,” they said. “The club has raised a number of points on its operation to the Premier League.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Any delays to a decision being communicated within the stadium are due to the length of time it takes VAR to alert us at Villa Park.</p>
      <p>“Once we receive the alert, it is placed on the screens within seconds. Everything you see on the screen is sent to us by VAR. Supporters are likely to be aware of similar issues with this process across all grounds.”</p>

      <p>Chief executive Christian Purslow raised ‘grave concerns’ about VAR technology were raised at a Premier League meeting on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Purslow was <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa’s</a> representative at a conference held between top-flight clubs to discuss its use.</p>
      <p>Referees' chief Mike Riley led the discussion over the technology, which has caused weekly controversy since its introduction in the league at the start of the season.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Purslow told Sky Sports: “I’ve got grave concerns, but so has everybody in the room. We had a very robust discussion.</p>
      <p>“The messages got though to the League and the Referees’ Association that fans are unhappy and many other stakeholders in the game think we’ve got to do a whole lot better.</p>
      <p>“I expect to see real improvement in the speed of decisions, consistency - which is what everybody craves - and I think above all else for those of us in stadia, we want much better communication of what’s going on before, during and after.</p>
      <p>“I think if we get those three ingredients then things will be a whole lot better in a a few months’ time.”</p>
