      <h1>Saturday's Best Bet: Thousand Words should have big say in Bob Hope</h1>

      <p>#3 THOUSAND WORDS (7-5) was a professional winner in his 6.5 furlong bow at Santa Anita Oct. 26. In that race, he stalked from the outside post and smartly wore down experienced foe <i>Thunder Code</i>, and the show finisher was more than six lengths back. Flavien Prat sticks with Bob Baffert’s $1 million purchase, and he could easily take a step forward and win a stakes race second time out.</p>
      <p>#1 Rager (12-1) stalked and pulled off a 19-1 upset in his turf sprint bow Oct. 20. Andrew Lerner has good stats with his turf/dirt starters, and with his recent graduates trying winners for the first time.</p>
      <p>#5 High Velocity (5-2) is a $350k Keeneland sales grad exiting an easy debut victory as the chalk. Drayden Van Dyke wins races with Bob Baffert, and he should be forwardly placed.</p>
      <p>#6 Strongconstitution (9-5) went all the way in his five panel turf bow, and just missed while well clear of the show in the restricted Sunny Slope at six furlongs on dirt Oct. 20. He drew well and projects an outside tactical trip under Abel Cedillo. He drilled a local bullet for this Nov. 9.</p>
      <p>#4 Zimba Warrior (12-1) finished a non-threatening 3rd in the Sunny Slope. He will probably like seven panels but will have to run faster to compete here.</p>
