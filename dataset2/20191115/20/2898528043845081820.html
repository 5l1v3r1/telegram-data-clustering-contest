      <p>A flyweight bout at a Brave CF event in Bahrain ended in ugly fashion on Friday.</p>
      <p>Bahrain’s own Hussain Ayyad was in action against unbeaten Latvian fighter Matiss Zaharovs when he landed an ill-fated leg kick that resulted in what appeared to be an ankle injury.</p>

      <p>The bout was immediately waved off and Zaharovs was awarded a first-round TKO victory. Zaharovs is now 3-0 as a pro, while Ayyad falls to 4-3. Hopefully for Ayaad, he doesn’t suffer any significant damage outside of another loss on his record.</p>
