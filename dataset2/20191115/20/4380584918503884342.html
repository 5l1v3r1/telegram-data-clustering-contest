      <p>Former San Francisco Giants reliever Will Smith -- a man who was an All-Star in 2019 and one of the best at his position in baseball -- signed a <a href="https://www.mlb.com/braves/news/braves-sign-will-smith-to-three-year-deal">three-year deal on Thursday</a> to play for the Braves. On Friday, he sent out a message to San Francisco -- thanking the city for the three years he spent there and helping him get back on track after serious injury.</p>
      <p>Except, well, he did <i>it</i>. He committed the ultimate sin.</p>

      <p>You'd think it was as if he said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6DUwMnDxEs">Tony Bennett</a> is trash. Or that the Golden Gate Bridge is just a glorified erector set. Or that the burritos are overrated.</p>
      <p>But no -- it was much, much worse.</p>
      <p>He called San Francisco “San Fran.”</p>

      <p>I don't get it. I've never gotten it. What's wrong with saying San Fran? We shorten everything in life. It makes things easier.</p>
      <p>Imagine if you had to say "Laugh Out Loud" instead of "LOL." It'd be weird, nobody would text you anymore.</p>
      <p>Philadelphia instead of Philly?</p>
      <p>Frederick instead of Fred? I know Fred wouldn't like it.</p>
      <p>Abdominal muscles instead of abs.</p>
      <p>What does RSVP even stand for?</p>
      <p>Ante meridiem instead of a.m.?</p>
      <p>I know I'm getting a little extreme here, but the point is: What's the big deal? A <a href="https://sf.curbed.com/2018/1/26/16936872/san-fran-frisco-survey-nickname-francisco">recent poll</a> of San Franciscans revealed for whatever reason, it is a big deal.</p>
      <p>Over 40 percent state they always say San Francisco. The only other nickname that got above 15 percent was "The City," which, when there's a bunch of other cities around the world, can be a bit confusing. San Fran, SF and Frisco (<a href="https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Is-calling-city-Frisco-really-that-bad-5291665.php">THE WORST THING EVER</a>) were on the very low to never ever use end.</p>
      <p>One man, Charles Fracchia, the San Francisco Historical Society President and co-founder of Rolling Stone Magazine, even sent out a press release about it all.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“It is vitally important to call the city ‘San Francisco’ over ‘San Fran,’” Fracchia said in a Bospar press release, insisting that “utilizing the full name of any person or place gives it dignity, and I believe ‘San Francisco’ deserves to be referred to in its full name.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Is-calling-city-Frisco-really-that-bad-5291665.php">local writer said</a> he would "cut off his right arm before he let someone tattoo "San Fran" on it."</p>
      <p>I texted one of my best friends, a guy who was born in San Francisco and still lives there today, to see what he would say if I referred to San Francisco as San Fran. It's been three hours and he still hasn't responded. He's probably deleted my number and is on a plane to New York to punch me in the face. Or maybe he'll send Madison Bumgarner to sort things out.</p>

      <p>And listen, this isn't something against the city of San Francisco. I love it. I love the Bay Bridge, I love the food, the rolling hills, the people. Sometimes I just stare at pictures of John Stamos and play <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-OrHsG-03I&amp;t=18s">this song</a> over and over.</p>
      <p>But San Fran? C'mon, it's not THAT bad at all. It gets both parts of the word in there. I doubt Saint Francis of Assisi would mind at this point. Just give it some thought. Or yell at me on Twitter. Whatever.</p>
