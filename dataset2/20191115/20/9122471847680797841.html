      <h1>How Much Money Myles Garrett Will Lose During Indefinite Suspension</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T20:28:13+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 20:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>On Thursday night, the Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers faced off in a pivotal AFC North battle with playoff implications on the line.</p>
      <p>The rivalry game turned ugly in the final seconds of the game. Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph dumped off a pass to running back Trey Edmunds when he was tackled by Browns defensive end Myles Garrett.</p>
      <p>Rudolph and Garrett then tussled on the ground before Garrett ripped the helmet off of <a href="https://thespun.com/nfl/afc-north/cleveland-browns/video-myles-garrett-ejected-after-swinging-helmet-at-mason-rudolph">Rudolph and then hit him with it</a>. Several Steelers players jumped in to help their quarterback – namely Maurkice Pouncey.</p>
      <p>The NFL didn’t wait long to suspended several players involved.</p>
      <p>Garrett received an indefinite suspension – for at least the rest of the 2019 season, including the playoffs.</p>
      <p>With six regular season games left, Garrett will forfeit just over $1 million in salary. According to Spotrac, Garrett loses $1.14 million – the fifth-largest amount of money lost to suspension in 2019.</p>

      <p>Garrett wasn’t the only player punished as a result of the fracas. Fellow Browns defensive lineman Larry Ogunjobi received a one-game suspension for a late hit on Rudolph after the initial incident.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Steelers offense lineman Maurkice Pouncey received a three-game suspension for punching and kicking Garrett.</p>
      <p>Mason Rudolph reportedly received a fine for his role as well.</p>
