      <p>Agharta Studio has confirmed it will be releasing the PSVR title Stardust Odyssey on December 3rd, allowing players to explore a fantasy universe. The story of the game is that there is a darkness in the Abyss that needs to be watched out for but players will be navigating around large merchant convoys searching for treasures.</p>

      <p>Stardust Odyssey will be playable solo or in co-op mode with 14 levels to explore for the treasures and ethers to upgrade your spaceship. The levels will have bosses to fight which is why youâ€™ll need to upgrade the ship as they are deemed to be tough. Alongside the bosses are traps that need to be watched out for.</p>
      <p>Stardust Odyssey was announced earlier this year in a Sony State of Play.</p>
