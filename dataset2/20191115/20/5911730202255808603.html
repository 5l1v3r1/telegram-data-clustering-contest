      </p>
      <p>The scammers have programmed their call to read as Duke Energy on the victim's caller ID.</p>
      <p>The caller informs the resident that they are past due on their electric bill and need to pay immediately.</p>
      <p>Detectives said the caller will then instruct residents to go and purchase a gift card or re-loadable debit card from a retail store. The caller provides a call back number and explains how the victim needs to call back and provide card numbers to satisfy past due payments.</p>
      <p>So far, five Pinellas County residents have been targeted by the scam since Veteran's Day.</p>
      <p>They said as a reminder, most scam phone callers will ask for the resident to obtain gift cards to call back with.</p>
      <p>If anyone has been a victim of the scam, or a similar one, you are asked to call the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office.</p>
