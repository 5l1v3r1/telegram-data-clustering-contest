      <p>Lewis Hamilton finished only fifth as Sebastian Vettel led a Ferrari one-two in practice for the Brazilian Grand Prix.</p>
      <p>After the opening track session at Interlagos took place in damp conditions – with Red Bull’s Alex Albon setting the pace before crashing out – Ferrari held the advantage in the dry.</p>
      <p>Vettel finished just 0.021 seconds clear of his team-mate Charles Leclerc, who will serve a 10-place grid penalty for Sunday’s race following an engine change, with Red Bull driver Max Verstappen third and Valtteri Bottas fourth for Mercedes.</p>

      <p>Hamilton, who closed out his sixth world championship in Texas a fortnight ago, ended the running 0.223secs adrift of Vettel.</p>
      <p>Ferrari were off the pace in Austin as Leclerc finished a distant fourth, almost one minute behind race victor Bottas, while Vettel failed to get to the chequered flag following a rear suspension failure.</p>
      <p>But the Scuderia, who have largely boasted the grid’s speediest package since the summer break, appear to be in a strong position heading into the remainder of the weekend at the penultimate round of the campaign.</p>
      <p>Hamilton may have already wrapped up the title that moved him to within one of Michael Schumacher’s record collection of seven.</p>

      <p>But the Englishman, 34, will be keen to end his latest world championship-winning campaign in good form as he bids to match Schumacher’s tally in 2020.</p>
      <p>Albon fell foul to the tricky conditions in the first running, crashing out at the final long-sweeping left hander to the start-finish line and damaging his Red Bull.</p>
      <p>He was able to participate in the day’s concluding action, but finished only ninth, one second off Vettel’s pace.</p>
      <p>Robert Kubica, the Pole who will depart the sport for good at the year’s final round in Abu Dhabi following a heroic yet disappointing comeback, was rested for the first session, with Williams reserve driver Nicholas Latifi taking his place.</p>

      <p>Kubica returned for second practice, but crashed out on his very first flying lap, losing control of his Williams through the Senna Esses before ending up in the wall.</p>
      <p>The running was red-flagged as Kubica’s stricken Williams was recovered. He would play no further part.</p>
      <p>The red flags were deployed for a second time with five minutes left when Toro Rosso’s Daniil Kvyat fell off the track in a carbon-copy accident to Albon.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Kevin Magnussen finished sixth for Haas, one spot ahead of Renault’s Daniel Ricciardo.</p>
      <p>British 20-year-old Lando Norris ended up a disappointing 18th, eight places behind his McLaren team-mate Carlos Sainz. George Russell adopted his customary 19th position, in a season to forget for the once-mighty Williams team.</p>
