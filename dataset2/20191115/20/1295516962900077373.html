      <p>Zod was last seen installing himself and his family as the dictators on a faraway world, reaching a tentative truce with Superman while nearly throttling Green Lantern within an inch of his life when he attempted to stop him. With the Kryptonian military officer active back on Earth, the fragile peace between him and the Man of Steel may soon come to an explosive end.</p>
