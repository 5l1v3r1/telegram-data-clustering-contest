      <p>Two Ukrainian mining engineers have been killed and another four injured in explosions at an arms depot near the eastern city of Kharkiv, Ukraine's military says.</p>
      <p>The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces said the explosions took place on November 15 during a planned disposal of outdated ammunition at a military base.</p>
      <p>The four injured servicemen were hospitalized, with three of them in grave condition, it said in a statement.</p>
      <p>There were "no threats to local residents and infrastructure" and the blasts had stopped, it added.</p>
      <p>In March 2017, a fire triggered explosions at the same facility, killing one person and injuring five.</p>
      <p>There have been several explosions and fires at Ukrainian arms depots in recent years, amid fighting between government forces and Russia-backed separatists who hold parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.</p>
      <p>The conflict has killed more than 13,000 people since it began in April 2014.</p>
