      <h1>Love Island's Michael Griffiths and Ellie Brown 'are dating after meeting on Ex On The Beach'</h1>
      <h2>Ellie and Michael, who starred on different series of Love Island, reportedly found a spark between them while filming for Ex On The Beach</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T19:30:04+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 19:30</time> by <a rel="author">Will Twigger, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/will-twigger/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/love-island">Love Island</a> stars Ellie Brown and Michael Griffiths have embarked on a whirlwind romance, according to reports.</p>
      <p>They first crossed paths when the couple reportedly hit it off during filming <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/ex-on-the-beach">Ex On The Beach</a>.</p>
      <p>It must be fate as the stars both have featured in the Love Island villa but during different series.</p>
      <p>Michael had a rough stint in the villa, and was eventually rejected by winner Amber Gill in favour of Greg O'Shea. Ellie had equally bad luck after her romance with Charlie Brake ended in a nasty split following the show's end.</p>
      <p>A source told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10354877/love-island-ellie-brown-michael-griffiths/">The Sun</a> Michael, 28, and Ellie, 21, have tried to keep it all on the down-low.</p>
      <p>The source said: "Ellie and Michael hit it off during filming on Ex On The Beach and now they've started dating.</p>

      <p>"They were supposed to keep the relationship under wraps until the show had aired of course, but it seems they just couldn't keep quiet.</p>
      <p>"They both know what it's like to be caught up in the drama of a big reality TV show and they really bonded during their time on the programme. Now there's a new Love Island couple on the block."</p>
      <p>Michael had previously told The Sun that he was having a romance with someone - but wouldn't reveal her name.</p>

      <p>The hunky former firefighter claimed he was dating a "mystery" beauty but he kept pretty tight lipped on the details of their budding romance.</p>
      <p>Previously, he stressed his time on Love Island wasn't a true reflection of the real him.</p>

      <p>"In Love Island I was portrayed quite negatively," he said, "I was shown to be this person that I'm not.</p>
      <p>"So people tend to think I'm an a******e, and I'm not. You'll see a completely different side to me [during Ex On The Beach] and I won't come across as some kind of villain."</p>
      <p>Mirror Online has reached out to representatives of Ellie and Michael for comment.</p>
