      <h1>'Who wouldn't do it?' Two kids get second chance thanks to liver donors</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T19:13:36+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 19:13</time> by <a rel="author">Yolande Cole</a></address>
      <p>On the recent one-year mark of a life-saving surgery, 12-year-old Ica Malabanan sent Kathy Shirley a gift of a watch, to recognize the amount of time Shirley had devoted from her life last fall to give the child what doctors said she urgently needed: a liver transplant.</p>
      <p>The morning of Oct. 22, 2018, both Shirley and Ica went into surgery in Edmonton — Ica for a procedure that would last close to 10 hours. She remained in Edmonton for three months during her recovery, while it took Shirley two-and-a-half months before she was able to return to work.</p>
      <p>But the recovery time was all worth it when Shirley now sees Ica smiling and healthy.</p>
      <p>“The day I went and said goodbye (in the hospital), it was heartbreaking,” Shirley said. “She was in a little ball and there were tubes. That’s what I remember, and seeing (her) now — it’s awesome.”</p>
      <p>When Shirley volunteered to be a liver donor, she hadn’t even met the girl yet. But she and Ica’s mother, Mylene Malabanan, were friends and colleagues at Sobeys. Before Sobeys, the pair had coincidentally been co-workers at two other workplaces — much to the surprise of both of them, as they kept encountering each other on the job.</p>
      <p>Mylene said Shirley would often ask how she was doing, and how her kids were. But one day when she asked the question in a break room, Mylene couldn’t hide her emotions. Ica was not doing well and would need a transplant. Doctors advised it was the only treatment option for Ica after her liver cancer returned for a second time, following her first diagnosis at nine years of age.</p>
      <p>Shirley said her response to her friend was, “This is my blood type, if I can help.”</p>
      <p>It turned out she was needed, as Ica’s mother and other immediate family members didn’t share the same blood type, and the transplant needed to occur as soon as possible. And when Mylene went back to Shirley to talk about a donation, her co-worker didn’t hesitate to volunteer to give up part of her liver to save Ica.</p>
      <p>“There wasn’t any fear, even being wheeled into the surgery room,” Shirley said. “I had my mind made up. And obviously (it was) worth it.”</p>
      <p>The donor has now formed a much stronger friendship with her co-worker, and a special bond with Ica. While the Grade 8 student still has frequent medical appointments, and has to take daily anti-rejection medications, she has returned to a normal life involving school, singing and dancing.</p>
      <p>According to the Canadian Liver Foundation, the long-term success rate of transplantation for adults and children in Canada is over 80 per cent, and most patients return to a good quality of life within three to six months after surgery.</p>
      <p>In 2018, Alberta Health Services statistics indicate 12 living donor liver transplants were performed in Edmonton. Liver transplants from living donors are far less common than kidney transplants from living donors.</p>
      <p>However, the need is great. There are more than 100 liver diseases caused by a variety of factors, and one in four Canadians may be affected by these diseases, with ages of patients ranging from newborns to seniors. Biliary atresia is the leading cause of liver failure in children.</p>

      <p>Taya Vo, 12, was diagnosed with biliary atresia at 11 weeks of age, after her parents took her to the hospital with jaundice. She then underwent surgery to connect her small intestine directly to her liver.</p>
      <p>Bu her parents, Jennifer and Trieu, knew the surgery would only be a temporary fix. At 10 years of age, Taya was placed on the liver transplant waiting list because she was suffering from hepatopulmonary syndrome, which affects the lungs of people with advanced liver disease.</p>
      <p>“Her oxygen level was sitting in the low 70s, which for us, if we were sitting at the low 70s, I don’t know if we could function,” said Jennifer.</p>
      <p>“So for a while, her body was kind of adjusting, but it’s really low oxygen, and that was the reason why she had the transplant.”</p>
      <p>As soon as Taya was placed on the transplant waiting list, Jennifer began undergoing various tests to see if she could donate part of her liver to her daughter.</p>
      <p>For living transplants, donors are matched with recipients based on compatible liver size and blood type. Scans and biopsies and other tests confirmed that mother and daughter were a match, and both went into surgery on Dec. 12, 2017, just a few months after Taya went on the transplant waiting list in August.</p>

      <p>Jennifer described the transplant as a “big, big production” involving two teams and medical professionals, including a pediatric anesthesiologist and pediatric plastic surgeon.</p>
      <p>For Taya, the procedure lasted 12 hours, while Jennifer was in the operating room for just over six hours.</p>
      <p>Going into the procedure, “I was really nervous,” Taya recalled. “I was scared.”</p>
      <p>The transplant also involved the whole family staying in Edmonton for three months, with both parents taking leaves from work and older sister Taryn taking a break from her school.</p>
      <p>“I think having her sister there got her better a lot quicker,” Jennifer said.</p>
      <p>Taya agreed, noting her older sister wheeled her oxygen tank around for her in the hospital, and played video games with her during recovery. Because the hospitals where they each had their surgeries were attached, Jennifer could roll down the hall in a wheelchair to visit her daughter.</p>
      <p>While a new liver for Taya brought the family relief, they noted there are still lots of “ups and downs and bumps along the way,” including the ever-present worry of potential rejection of the new liver.</p>

      <p>Following the surgery, Taya took 11 daily medications; a number now reduced to four daily anti-rejection meds. Since the procedure, her parents say she has had a couple of instances where her body appeared to be rejecting her liver and doctors had to adjust her medications.</p>
      <p>Jennifer said it took about two months for her to recover from her surgery, in which doctors removed a portion of her liver. But she didn’t even think twice about undergoing such a major procedure.</p>
      <p>“Everybody’s like, ‘Oh that’s an amazing thing you would do,’ but at the same time, who wouldn’t? Like honestly, who wouldn’t do it?”</p>
