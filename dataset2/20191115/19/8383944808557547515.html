      <h1>YPG/PKK recruited 270 terrorists from Germany, BfV intel agency reveals</h1>

      <p>The terrorist YPG/PKK group recruited nearly 270 foreign fighters from Germany who took part in battles and terror attacks in Syria and Iraq, a report by German domestic intelligence agency BfV revealed Friday.</p>
      <p>In an analysis published in BfV's quarterly newsletter, the agency said among the 270 YPG/PKK foreign fighters who traveled to the region since 2013, at least 22 were killed in clashes or during Turkey's anti-terror operations.</p>
      <p>Three German citizens, Jakob Riemer, Sarah Handelmann and Michael Panser, who were known to German authorities as left-wing extremists, were among those killed.</p>
      <p>The PKK has been banned in Germany since 1993, but it remains active, with nearly 14,500 followers among the country's Kurdish immigrant population.</p>
      <p>Ankara has long criticized German authorities for not taking serious measures against the PKK and its Syrian affiliate YPG – which continue to use Germany as a platform for their fund-raising, recruitment and propaganda activities.</p>
      <p>In its more than 30-year terror campaign against Turkey, the PKK – listed as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the U.S. and the EU – has been responsible for the deaths of nearly 40,000 people, including many women and children.</p>
