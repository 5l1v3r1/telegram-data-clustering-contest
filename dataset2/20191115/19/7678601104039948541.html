      <h1>From motorcycles to cars, village chief candidates run after votes with door prizes</h1>

      <p>Forget conventional campaign events: Candidates running for village chief in Rembun village in Pekalongan, Central Java, have opted for door prizes to attract votes.</p>
      <p>Rembun, located in Siwalan district, is among 206 villages in Pekalongan that recently held simultaneous village head elections.</p>
      <p>Three candidates were running for Rembun’s top seat, and each of them offered respectable door prizes for the lucky voters.</p>
      <p>The first candidate, Kaena, offered nine motorcycles for nine lucky voters, while Subeki, the second candidate, had prepared four new motorcycles for four voters winning the lottery.</p>
      <p>But the third candidate, Nur Hayyi, outdid his two rivals, offering five new motorcycles, a car and three <i>umrah </i>(minor haj)<i> </i>travel packages as door prizes.</p>
      <p>“I used my own money as well as donations from my relatives [for the prizes]. These gifts are for my voters, each of whom have already obtained a lottery ticket beforehand,” Hayyi said as quoted by <i>kompas.com.</i></p>
      <p>He added, however, that there would be no lucky draw and hence no door prizes should unless he wins the election. “If I lose the election, I will return the prizes to the dealers,” he added.</p>
      <p>Rusdi, a resident of Rembun village, said he believed the village chief candidates had organized door prize events to secure votes from the villagers.</p>
      <p>“This is the first time that a village chief [candidate] is giving away a car in return for victory,” he said, “It’s very interesting and also increases people’s motivation to cast their ballots.” <b>(dpk)</b></p>
