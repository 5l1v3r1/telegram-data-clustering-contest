      <h1>Twitter cracks down on political 'issue' adverts that microtarget users</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T19:05:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 19:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/laurence-dodds/" target="_blank">Laurence Dodds</a></address>
      <p>Twitter has announced restrictions on political microtargeting, cracking down on adverts that use detailed data to present different messages to different people amid growing scrutiny of  the practice.</p>
      <p>The social network said it would ban the most intrusive forms of targeting for "issue" ads that "raise awareness" or "call for action" about social causes, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/10/31/mark-zuckerberg-attacks-twitter-ban-political-adverts/">in addition to a total ban on traditional campaign ads announced last month</a>.</p>
      <p>Twitter will no longer allow issue advertisers to target individual people based on their email addresses or phone numbers, cutting off one of the most accurate and contentious targeting methods used by British political parties.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month the Telegraph revealed <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/10/27/revealed-fearsome-data-targeting-machine-will-power-labours/">how the Labour Party had built powerful tools to target individual voters on Facebook and Twitter</a> based on information about their lifestyles and social status bought from the credit checking agency Experian, in some cases potentially breaking British data privacy laws.</p>
      <p>All political parties will now be completely banned from advertising, but the new rules will also prevent their supporters and outriders from using similar methods, along with charities, campaigning groups and for-profit companies.</p>
      <p>The move may provoke further calls for similar restrictions from Facebook, which has been accused of undermining democracy by allowing politicians to target highly specific slices of the electorate with different, potentially contradictory messages.</p>

      <p>Del Harvey, Twitter's vice president of trust and safety, said: "We're trying to make sure that we don't allow for super-siloed hidden targeting and conversations around topics that further undermine the public conversation...</p>
      <p>"This is an initial approach, and we fully expect this to evolve over time as we identify new ways that we can build in protections. But we think that this is the right first step in the targeting space."</p>
      <p>Vijaya Gadde, the company's legal and policy lead, said the new rules had been crafted rapidly so that they would come into force before the UK's general election on December 12, among others. </p>
      <p>But the company also confirmed that it would <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/09/25/facebook-wont-fact-check-politicians-nick-clegg-announces/">join Facebook in refusing to take down blatantly false averts</a>, saying its new rules would help users hold advertisers accountable for what they say.</p>
      <p>"While I don't think that we can necessarily say that no one will ever be able to say something in an ad that has inaccuracies in it, we cance we can certainly say we're very much trying to structure this in a way that anyone will be held accountable for what they say," said Ms Harvey.</p>
      <p>Facebook has been heavily criticised for that policy, including by US politicians who submitted obviously false adverts in order to test it. Facebook, however, operates a third-party fact-checking programme for non-political content, whereas Twitter has never had any such programme.</p>
      <p>Twitter's new policy, which comes into force on November 22, will entirely forbid any ad that references "a candidate, political party, elected or appointed government official, election, referendum, ballot measure, legislation, regulation, directive, or judicial outcome". Candidates, parties and elected politicians will also be forbidden from running ads of any kind.</p>
      <p>Spending records from the 2017 general election <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/10/31/tories-set-worst-hit-twitters-ban-political-adverts/">suggest that the Conservative Party could be most hit by that change</a>, as it spent almost four times as much money on Twitter adverts as Labour did.</p>
      <p>An exception will be made for news publishers that meet basic criteria of transparency and editorial accountability, who can reference political content as long as they do not advocate for one side or another.</p>
      <p>Adverts that "educate, raise awareness, and/or call for people to take action" about social issues will still be allowed, but advertisers will only be able to target them based on broad geographic areas, keywords and "interests". Targeting via political keywords and interests, such as "liberal" or "conservative", will also be banned.</p>
      <p>The rules may create a loophole for aggressively partisan news organisations, which will be able to promote political content as long as it does not slip across the line into "advocating" for one side or another. It is unclear where the line will be drawn between presenting news through a partisan lens and outright supporting one side or another.</p>
      <p>Ms Harvey said that Twitter would "actively monitor" how advertisers are following the new rules, and potentially change them if it concludes that advertisers are finding ways to "game" the system.</p>
