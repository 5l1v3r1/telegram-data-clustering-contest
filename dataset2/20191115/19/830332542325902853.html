      <p>MADISON, Wis. - A person whose anonymous open records requests were rejected by the Madison School District because they wouldn't identify who they were is suing the district.</p>
      <p>The lawsuit filed Friday demands that the school district fulfill more than two dozen open records requests the person made over a four-month period, the Wisconsin State Journal reported. The person who lives in Madison is not identified in the lawsuit filed by attorney Tom Kamenick, founder of the Wisconsin Transparency Project.</p>
      <p>The lawsuit said Madison schools refused to release 21 of the requested records sought by the anonymous person and has failed to respond to five of the requests.</p>
      <p>The district, through its spokeswoman, did not have an immediate comment on the lawsuit.</p>
      <p>Wisconsin law allows those requesting public records to remain anonymous. It does allow an exception "whenever the requested record is kept at a private residence or whenever security reasons or federal law or regulations so require."</p>
