      <p>The Ilorin Zonal Office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission on Friday arraigned four suspects on offences that border on internet and other related fraud.</p>
      <p>The suspects: Chilaka Dickson, Abdulahi Abubakar, Olayiwola Azeez and Enoch Oluyode – were docked on four separate charges before Justice Mahmood Abdulgafar of a Kwara State High Court sitting in Ilorin, the State capital. </p>
      <p>The charge against one the defendants reads: “That you, Abdulahi Abubakar ( Alias  David John) sometime between July and October, 2017, at Ilorin within the Judicial division of the Kwara State High Court, while acting as one Barrister David John; a Legal Practitioner and notary public in Kwara State with Yahoo mail account as barrister.davidjohn@@Yahoo.com did cheat one Anthony Galind with email by fraudulently inducing him in delivering to you the sum of $200.00 (Two hundred dollars) under the guise of procuring a marriage certificate between him and an alleged Melissa Cromwell,  a representation you knew to be false and thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 95 of the Penal Code and punishable under Section 322 of the same law.”</p>
      <p>The defendants, with the exception of Enoch Oluyode, pleaded guilty as charged. </p>
      <p>But Oluyode claimed innocence of the criminal charge brought against him. </p>
      <p>Items such as phones, laptops, money and a bag full of charms recovered from the defendants were tendered and admitted as exhibits. </p>
      <p>Prosecuting counsel, Andrew Akoja, urged the court to convict the defendants that pleaded guilty and fix a date to open the case against Oluyode. </p>
      <p>Justice Abdulgafar adjourned the matter till November 19 for further hearing.</p>
