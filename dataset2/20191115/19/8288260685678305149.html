      <h2>Moors take on AFC Fylde this weekend after an eventful week at the SportNation.bet Stadium</h2>

      <p>Solihull Moors aim to keep the feel good factor rolling against AFC Fylde this weekend after an eventful week at the SportNation.bet Stadium.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/solihull-moors-fc">Moors</a> go into Saturday afternoon's National League home clash just three points behind league leaders Bromley.</p>
      <p>Tim Flowers' promotion hopefuls have enjoyed a mini revival recently - a 5-1 triumph at Oxford City has set up an FA Cup second round tie against Rotherham United, selected for live coverage on BT Sports next month.</p>
      <p>And this week Moors bid farewell to club legend Liam Daly, as well as tying fan favourite Alex Gudger to a new contract.</p>

      <p>Gudger, a 26-year-old centre-half, has committed his future to the club until the summer of 2022.</p>
      <p>He said: “It’s been a long time happening and it’s had a bit of a process to it, but that’s just down to the games that we’ve had. We’ve finally got it over the line, and I’m delighted.</p>
      <p>“For me I just try and concentrate on the football pitch and try and do my bit. The club is in a great place at the minute. Everyone that comes to the club, whether it’s on loan or on contract, will tell you exactly the same.</p>
      <p>“I’m happy and I’m ready to kick on.”</p>
      <p>The departure of Daly is sad news, but Moors parted with the defensive stalwart on amicable terms and are planning a testimonial for him at the end of the season.</p>

      <p>Moors chairman Darryl Eales said: “Liam is iconic at Moors, both on and off the pitch. He is a talisman and epitomises the progression of Solihull Moors over the past three seasons.</p>
      <p>“I’m delighted that we have agreed to stage a testimonial for Liam at the end of this season and I’m sure Liam will be part of the Moors family for a long time to come.”</p>
      <p>Daly has parted company with the club by mutual consent with the centre-half out of contract next summer and Moors unable to guarantee him a new deal.</p>
      <p>“Moors are a fantastic club and I’m privileged to have played a part in the success over recent seasons," said Daly.</p>
      <p>“I leave with grateful thanks to many people, especially Mike Turl and Mark Fogarty, and, most of all, the amazing Moors fans.</p>
      <p>“The club is going from strength to strength and I will always be amongst its biggest fans and the testimonial at the end of the season is an added bonus.”</p>
      <p>Moors are hoping for an attendance of around 1,500 against Fylde.</p>
      <p>With it being international break weekend it is hoped season ticket holders from Aston Villa, Birmingham City, Coventry City, West Bromwich Albion and Wolverhampton Wanderers will take advantage of discounted prices.</p>
