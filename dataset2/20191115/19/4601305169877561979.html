      <p>A screw with a stripped head can be difficult to remove.</p>
      <p>There are a number of ways to remove screws with stripped heads. <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5901738/how-to-remove-screws-with-stripped-heads">Lifehacker</a> has a nice article on this subject.</p>
      <p>My favorite method of removing a stuck/stripped screw is with a pair of <a href="https://amzn.to/357HgEN">screw removal pliers</a>. They bite into the exposed sides of the screw head and you can twist the screw loose, then finish the job with a screwdriver. It's also a nice brute-force workaround for tamper-proof screw heads. This is the kind of tool you want to have in your toolbox now, instead of having to run out and buy one when it's needed.</p>

      <p>If the screw is really stuck, you risk breaking the head off the screw. If that happens, all is not lost. You can try to drill a small hole into the center of the screw shaft and pull out the screw with a <a href="https://amzn.to/37cPm0z">screw extractor</a>.</p>
