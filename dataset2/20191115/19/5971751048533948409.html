      <p>With the announcement of Nokia 6.2 and Nokia 7.2, Nokia Mobile also revealed that the announced devices are the first smartphones to feature Google Assistant’s Ambient Mode. The Ambient Mode is active when the devices are docked or charging, and offers to display time, photos, news, reminders, music controls, etc.</p>
      <p>As our reader Derry (thanks for the tip :)) shared with us, his Nokia 6.1 got the Ambient Mode this morning. The Google Assistant on the 6.1 notified him that he can now start using the Ambient Mode to “see a slideshow of photos, get commute info, control media and much more.”</p>
      <p>As far as I understand, this feature isn’t enabled by a software update usually delivered on a monthly level by Nokia Mobile, but an update to Google Assistant. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-assistant-ambient-mode-rolling-out/">XDA-developers</a> also reported that users of Xiaomi’s Redmi K20 Pro also reported receiving the Ambient Mode. We can expect more devices to soon gain access to this new feature as well.</p>
