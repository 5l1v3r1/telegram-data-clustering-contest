      <p>Twenty-five years ago today (November 15, 1994), Method Man gave fans his <i>Tical</i> album. The Def Jam Records album was the first Wu-Tang Clan solo album following <a href="https://ambrosiaforheads.com/2013/11/remembering-wu-tang-clans-enter-the-wu-tang-36-chambers-20-years-later-food-for-thought/"><i>Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)</i></a> almost exactly a year earlier. Meth’s RZA-produced debut would achieve platinum status and earn the Shaolin representative a Grammy for <a href="https://ambrosiaforheads.com/2015/04/a-love-jones-still-getting-by-with-method-man-mary-j-20-years-later-food-for-thought/">work with Mary J. Blige on “All I Need.”</a> That album would also showcase some talent under Iron Lung’s wing, including singer Blue Raspberry, Carlton Fisk (not to be confused with the baseball great), and Street Life.</p>
      <p>A quarter-century later, Meth’ and Street Life are still running together. Early this year, they released <a href="https://ambrosiaforheads.com/2019/02/method-man-mobb-deep-havoc-squad-up/">“Squad Up.”</a> Notably, the song featured production and a guest verse from Mobb Deep’s Havoc, who has <a href="https://ambrosiaforheads.com/2019/02/method-man-mobb-deep-havoc-squad-up/">more than 20 years of history working with M-E-T-H-O-D</a>. Now comes the video.</p>

      <p>The video combines the three veteran MCs rapping to the camera at New York City’s Overthrow. Meanwhile, there are shots of a bike squad roaming the Big Apple streets. Like those cycles, Meth’s verse leaves marks on the pavement. “<i>Look, red bones and red bottoms / Like Red Bull, we gone’ give ’em wings, we red dot ’em / Candy rappers, send ’em in, we Red Hot ’em / Head-shot ’em / Go against my grain, get head problems / Big dummy, garbage rappers, we Red Foxx / Shoot an actor in Hi-Def, then Red Box / Tip the scales in my favor, stay in your Top 10 / Life’s like a triple beam, I’m weighing my options / Y’all like, ‘Wild, Meth’, you high, Meth’ / Keep a big poppa’ ’cause I ain’t ready to die yet / I digress / Or I’m just too intense to digest / Stretched in a Pyrex / Compliments to my Chef / Game ain’t been the same since I left / Are they really crooks or just a pain in my neck? / Wu-Tang, ain’t no lames in my set / Fresh pair of Nike Airs, I just do it for my check / I’ll be the first to tell these rappers to get your bars up / Shout to P, you know it’s havoc when we mob up,</i>” he spits. Crisp, clear, and clever, this is one of Method Man’s best verses of 2019.</p>

      <p>With his mahogany voice, Street Life follows. Then comes Havoc. The M-O-B-B cofounder closes things out with his signature punchy rasp delivery. He references his Wu-Tang associates in passing with a warning to imitators and funk-fakers. “<i>Black Timbs and black mask / Basula, ni**as know they rap trash / My shooters get all up in dat ass / I maneuver, finish sh*t, no half-ass / Little ni**as, we birthed y’all, for real though / Protect ya neck, you stomped out with steel-toes / My real bro’s, respect the code, it’s real, yo / New ni**as lookin’ like some weirdos.</i>”</p>
