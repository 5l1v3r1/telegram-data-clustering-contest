      <h1>Disney+ will fix its 'Simpsons' widescreen problem in 2020</h1>
      <h2>Viewers will be able to choose between 4x3 or cropped widescreen versions.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T19:35:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 19:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.facebook.com/richard.lawler" target="_blank">Richard Lawler</a></address>
      <p>As soon as Disney+ launched, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/12/disney-plus-widescreen-simpsons-problems/">fans of <i>The Simpsons </i>noticed a big problem</a>. In a repeat of an issue that occurred when FXX started playing old episodes a few years ago, someone made the decision to crop and zoom <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015/02/14/simpsons-world-streams-in-4-3-ratio/">older 4x3 aspect ratio episodes</a> to fill out an HD widescreen frame. It was eventually corrected, and it turns out that new owner Disney will also fix things up -- eventually.</p>
      <p>In a statement, a Disney spokesperson said that "in early 2020" it will offer a toggle for the first 19 seasons of episodes so people can choose to view them in their original format -- important for many visual gags that extend to the top or bottom of the frame -- or widescreen-adjusted.</p>

        <b>Disney:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>We presented "The Simpsons" in 16:9 aspect ratio at launch in order to guarantee visual quality and consistency across all 30 seasons. Over time, Disney+ will roll out new features and additional viewing options. As part of this, in early 2020, Disney+ will make the first 19 seasons (and some episodes from Season 20) of "The Simpsons" available in their original 4:3 aspect ratio, giving subscribers a choice of how they prefer to view the popular series.</blockquote>
