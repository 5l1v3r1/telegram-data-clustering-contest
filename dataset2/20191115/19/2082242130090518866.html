      <h3>Toronto Maple Leafs vs Boston Bruins: 7:00 p.m.***<br/>Watch on: TVAs, TSN4, NESN</h3>
      <h3>Opponent’s site: <a href="https://www.stanleycupofchowder.com/">Stanley Cup of Chowder</a></h3>
      <p>*** This is the HHOF induction game. Assume that time is very, very approximate, and the inductees will be announced and on the ice, and one of them is a Maple Leafs employee, so it will be somewhat of a big deal.</p>

      <p>The Bruins last played a few days ago in a thrilling shootout loss to the Panthers, as both teams sought to make the Atlantic a real six-horse race. The Leafs last played hockey last Saturday against the Flyers, where the Leafs also lost in a shootout.</p>
      <p>Both teams should be ready to resume the eternal battle tonight.</p>
      <h3>Maple Leafs Lines</h3>
      <p>From today’s morning skate</p>
      <p>Andreas Johnsson - Auston Matthews - William Nylander<br/>Zack Hyman - John Tavares - Kasperi Kapanen<br/>Ilya Mikheyev - Jason Spezza - Trevor Moore<br/>Nic Petan - Nick Shore - Frederik Gauthier</p>
      <p>Morgan Rielly - Cody Ceci<br/>Jake Muzzin - Tyson Barrie<br/>Travis Dermott - Justin Holl</p>
      <p>Frederik Andersen<br/>Kasimir Kaskisuo</p>
      <h3>Boston Bruins Lines</h3>
      <p>from <a href="https://www.dailyfaceoff.com/teams/boston-bruins/line-combinations/">Daily Faceoff</a></p>
      <p>Brad Marchand - Patrice Bergeron - David Pastrnak<br/>Anders Bjork - David Krejci - Charlie Coyle<br/>Joakim Nordstrom - Sean Kuraly - Chris Wagner<br/>Trent Frederic - Par Lindholm - Danton Heinen</p>
      <p>Zdeno Chara- Charlie McAvoy<br/>Matt Grzelcyk - Brandon Carlo<br/>Urho Vaakanainen - Connor Clifton</p>
      <p>Tuukka Rask<br/>Jaroslav Halak</p>
      <p>It should be a Rask vs. Andersen game tonight, and what’s there to say about that? We’ve got 14 playoff games with those guys facing each other, and we know who they both are.</p>
      <p>The Leafs need Andersen to be his best, considering they are losing a player every other day to serious injury and are down to playing guys who should be one hashtag campaign from being more famous than they deserve. Nic Petan is likely in for Timashov today on the fourth line, speaking of, and the power play units were discussed at length in this cheerful post’s comments:</p>

      <p>The key to this game is very, very simple. Whichever one of those top two lines gets the easier matchup — and that means David Krejci, who is hardly terrible — they need to play at their absolute best non-stop, and that goes double for whatever pair of defenders they’re on the ice with.</p>
      <p>No one gets tonight off. (Well, you can take it off. You’re not contractually required to watch it.)</p>
      <p>That’s the deal, Leafs. Go forth and play it like you mean it.</p>
