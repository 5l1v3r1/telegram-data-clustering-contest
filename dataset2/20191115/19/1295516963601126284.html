      <p>Asked on <a href="https://twitter.com/mguggenheim/status/1195471078337835008?s=20">Twitter</a> for any teases about Laurel Lance in the "Crisis on Infinite Earths" crossover or the <i>Green Arrow and the Canaries </i>spin-off, <i>Arrow </i>creator Marc Guggenheim replied, "Earth-1 Laurel in Crisis, Earth-2 Laurel in spin-off."</p>

      <p>After having been with the series since its beginning, Earth-1 Laurel died in Season 4, episode 18, which was titled "Eleven-Fifty-Nine" after her time of death. She was later replaced by her doppelganger from Earth-2, the villainous Black Siren. In more recent seasons, Black Siren has served as something of an ally to Team Arrow.</p>
