      <h3>What is Auston Matthews accused of doing?</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/ca/nhl/news/auston-matthews-video-emerges-security-guard-incident/1ipvbdsewdiqs1emeiv8zwla9p">According to the police repor</a>t,at 2 a.m. on May 26, Matthews and a group of friends allegedly tried to open a security guard's cardoor outside his apartment complex as she sat inside thecar completing paperwork. When the security guard exited her vehicle, she came across Matthews and his friends, who told her "they wanted to see what she would do and believed it would be funny to see how she would respond."</p>
      <p>As the security guard confronted Matthews and his friends — who, <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/ca/nhl/news/auston-matthews-video-emerges-security-guard-incident/1ipvbdsewdiqs1emeiv8zwla9p">by her recounting of the incident, were drunk</a>—Matthews allegedly walked away from the group and pulled down his pants, eventually bending over and grabbing his butt, though he still wore underwear. According to the guard, Matthews' friend asked her not to inform building management of the incident andsaid Matthews had "beendoing that up and down Scottsdale Road" even after his friends warned him police could take notice.</p>
      <p>The report notes after Matthews and his friends left, the guard continued her work and came across one of Matthews' friends again at about 2:30 a.m., whoasked her not to tell building management about the incident once more.</p>
      <h3>Is there video of the alleged incident?</h3>
      <p>Yes. While video of the incident has not been publicly released, the police report notes that thebuilding manager showed a policeofficer surveilance video of a man walking toward the building with his pants around his ankles, who was confirmed by building management to be Matthews.</p>
      <p>In the security guard's interview with police, captured on the officer's bodycamera, she said she would not have pressed charges against Matthews; however Matthews' father had claimed he did nothing wrong when informed of the incident bybuilding management and said that the guard's claims were untrue.</p>
      <p>“Now the father said, ‘My son said he didn’t do any of that,'" the guard said<a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/09/25/auston-matthews-nhl-scottsdale-charge-victim-video/">in video released by TMZ</a>."[The building manager was]like, 'Really? Standby. Let me you send you a video clip of what your son said he didn’t do.'"</p>
      <h3>Disorderly conduct charge: What it means in Arizona</h3>
      <p>According to the<a href="https://www.azleg.gov/ars/13/02904.htm">Arizona state legislature's website</a>, disorderly conduct is classified within the state as when a person commitsany of the following six actions "with intent to disturb the peace or quiet of a neighborhood, family or person, or with knowledge of doing so":</p>
      <p><b>1.</b> Engages in fighting, violent or seriously disruptive behavior.</p>
      <p><b>2.</b> Makes unreasonable noise.</p>
      <p><b>3.</b> Uses abusive or offensive language or gestures to any person present in a manner likely to provoke immediate physical retaliation by such person.</p>
      <p><b>4.</b> Makes any protracted commotion, utterance or display with the intent to prevent the transaction of the business of a lawful meeting, gathering or procession.</p>
      <p><b>5.</b> Refuses to obey a lawful order to disperse issued to maintain public safety in dangerous proximity to a fire, a hazard or any other emergency.</p>
      <p><b>6.</b> Recklessly handles, displays or discharges a deadly weapon or dangerous instrument.</p>
      <p>The classification notes that disorderly conduct categorizedunder option six — referred to as subsection A, paragraph 6 — is a Class 6 felony in Arizona. Disorderly conduct that falls under the first five categories is a Class 1 misdemeanor.Matthews' charge falls under the latter. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericmacramalla/2019/09/25/auston-matthews-facing-serious-legal-issues-following-disorderly-conduct-charges/#1547c0c262d8">According to sports law writer Eric Macramalla</a>,itcould result in up to six months in jail, a $2,500 fine and up to five years probation if convicted.</p>
      <p>Macramalla notes that a civil lawsuit could be filed, too.</p>
      <h3>Auston Matthews, Maple Leafs statements</h3>
      <p>TheLeafs <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/ca/nhl/news/maple-leafs-auston-matthews-faces-disorderly-conduct-charge-in-arizona/k42u7pjx1hyr1hzeazxgjam0n">issued the following statement</a> after news broke about Matthews' charge on Sept. 24:</p>
      <p>"The Toronto Maple Leafs are aware of the complaint of disturbing the peace against forward Auston Matthews.Auston is cooperating fully with the relevant authorities but neither he nor the Club will comment any further out of respect for the process involved."</p>
      <p>On Sept. 25, Matthews <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/ca/nhl/news/auston-matthews-issues-statement-on-arizona-disorderly-conduct-charge/19u9tmxnwvd261l1n0swlogc1q">made a statement to reporters</a> after practicing with the Leafs but did not take questions.</p>
      <p>"Obviously [it'snot something I think any of us wish we were talking about today, but unfortunately it's the situation we're in," he said."I regret any of my actions that would ever put a distraction on the team or distress on any individual.I take a lot of pride in preparing myself for the season and representing the Toronto Maple Leafs as well as I can.”</p>
      <p>Statements made by Matthews' teammates, coachesand GM throughout the day made it apparent that Matthews <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/ca/nhl/news/maple-leafs-gm-kyle-dubas-found-out-about-auston-matthews-incident-through-twitter/115r1blwxwv791pgem2lb649ex">had not informed the Leafs</a> of the situation before it became public knowledge. Dubas even told reporters that he called the star center after reading the news on Twitter.</p>
      <p>"There was no ducking, there was no denying anything," Dubas said of his call with Matthews after the team's preseason game on Sept 25."Hewas very honest with me about what had happened.Iwould've liked to know before, but I'm happy that in the moment when he could have ducked away or deferred thathe was honest with me."</p>
      <p>Dubas told reporters that"moments like this" remind the organization just how young some of its players are, and that the team has an obligation to help themlearn how to conduct themselves off the ice as well as on it.</p>
      <p>"I think you always wish that whenever you're part of any organization, athletics or otherwise, that there's never going to be any issues, there's never going to be any errors in judgment and never going to be any distractions. Unfortunately, thereoften are," Dubas said. "We have to use it as an opportunity to continue to educate our whole organization —every player, every staff member —about the way that we expect our organization to conduct its business here at the rink every day — in the weight room, in the community —and how they interact with every citizen that they come into contact with, because when they are doing so they're representing the Toronto Maple Leafs."</p>
      <p>Matthewshas called his decision not to inform the Leafs of the charges "an error in judgment on my part."</p>
      <p>After the case was dismissed on Nov. 14, Matthews told reporters that he was "truly sorry" for his behavior.</p>
      <p>"I never meant to cause any distress to this woman and I can assure you that I've learned from my mistakes and my actions," <a href="https://twitter.com/kristen_shilton/status/1195374565863673861">he said via Twitter</a>.</p>

      <p>Maple Leafs team president and alternate governor Brendan Shanahan issued the following statement after Matthews' chargewas dismissed:</p>
      <p>“The Toronto Maple Leafs are committed to developing and promoting the qualities of good character, respect and equality in our organization, including our players, and we recognize and embrace the role we serve in the community. While Auston has been an exceptional ambassador for the Leafs in representing those values, his conduct in this incident last May failed to meet expectations.<br/>We appreciate that Auston has publicly reiterated today that he is truly sorry for his conduct and has recognized the impact his actions caused. We have no doubt that he has learned a valuable lesson and will grow from this experience.”</p>
      <h3>Will the NHL or the Maple Leafs punish Auston Matthews?</h3>
      <p>No announcements have been made yetindicating that either the league or the Leafs will punish Matthews for the incident.Dubas <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/ca/nhl/news/maple-leafs-gm-kyle-dubas-found-out-about-auston-matthews-incident-through-twitter/115r1blwxwv791pgem2lb649ex">noted</a> that while he is "disappointed" with Matthews, the young superstarand the Leafs are still on good terms.</p>
      <p>There is the issue of theteam'scaptaincy, which has been vacant since the Leafs traded former captain Dion Phaneuf to the Senators in Feb. 2016. In the three seasons since then, Matthews, Mitch Marner, Morgan Rielly and 2018 free agent acquisition John Tavares have all emerged as candidates to be the team's next captain.</p>
      <p>Babock told reporters on Sept. 13 that <a href="https://www.tsn.ca/babcock-toronto-maple-leafs-captain-decision-coming-up-1.1365059">a decision on who will serve as captain</a> was "coming soon," but the Matthews news may have created an awkward situation if the plan was to name No. 34 the captain. Tavares was ultimately <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/ca/nhl/news/toronto-maple-leafs-name-john-tavares-25th-captain/1m3fdfd2jyd8a18nwlybkn716c">named the team's captain</a> on Oct. 2.</p>

      <p>Prosecutors and Matthews' lawyers were previously<a href="https://twitter.com/rwesthead/status/1192222240823291904">scheduled to meet for a trial readiness conference</a>on Nov. 27 in Scottsdale regarding thecharge. <a href="https://twitter.com/EricOnSportsLaw/status/1192448992292098058?s=20">TSN legal analyst Eric Macramalla</a>had noted earlier in the month on Twitter that Matthews' case "has a profile" for settlement.</p>
