      <h1>Adam Schiff Blocks Devin Nunes from Letting Members Use GOP Time</h1>

      <p>House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) blocked Ranking Member Devin Nunes (R-CA) from allowing another member, Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY), to use the GOP’s time during the second portion of Friday’s public hearing featuring former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch.</p>
      <p>During the opening of the second portion of Friday’s public impeachment hearing, Nunes attempted to yield his time to Stefanik, prompting yet another interruption from Chairman Schiff.<br/>“The gentlewoman will suspend. The gentlewoman will suspend,” Schiff said as Stefanik began to speak.</p>
      <p>“What is the interruption for this time? It is our time,” Stefanik stated.</p>
      <p>“The gentlewoman will suspend. You’re not recognized. Mr. Nunes, you and the minority counsel,” Schiff stated.</p>
      <p>Nunes pointed out that he recognized Stefanik, but Schiff interrupted again.</p>
      <p>“Under House Resolution 660, you are not allowed to yield time except to minority counsel, Schiff stated.</p>
      <p>“The Ranking Member yielded time to another member of Congress,” Stefanik interjected.</p>
      <p>“That is not accurate,” Schiff stated.</p>
      <p>Nunes told Schiff he was “gagging” the congresswoman from New York, and Stefanik tried to question Yovanovitch once again, to no avail.</p>
      <p>“The gentlewoman will suspend. You’re not recognized,” Schiff said.</p>
      <p>“This is the fifth time you have interrupted members of Congress,” Stefanik stated.</p>
      <p>“The gentlewoman is not recognized,” Schiff said, wielding the gavel. “The gentlewoman will suspend.”</p>
      <p>“Mr. Chair, we control the time. It has been customary in this committee that whoever controls the time can yield to whomever they wish,” Nunes said.</p>
      <p>“If we have members of Congress who have a few questions, it seems appropriate that we be able to let Ms. Stefanik ask her question,” he added.</p>
      <p>“Mr. Nunes, you or minority counsel is recognized,” Schiff rebutted.</p>
      <p>“Alright,” Nunes said, yielding to Steve Castor.</p>
      <p>The moment was largely demonstrative of the concerns Republicans had over the partisan impeachment resolution, which effectively granted Schiff unprecedented power.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the hearing, Schiff <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/15/adam-schiff-interrupts-republican-asking-if-he-will-interrupt-republicans/">interrupted</a> Stefanik as she asked whether he would “continue to prohibit witnesses from answering Republican questions as you’ve done in closed hearings and as you did this week.”</p>
      <p>“That is not a proper point of order. The gentlewoman will suspend,” Schiff responded, sparking a contentious back and forth:</p>
