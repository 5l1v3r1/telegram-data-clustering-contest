      <p>Homegrown ride-hailing app Gojek is focusing on improving its user experience in Indonesia and other countries where it operates, while also seeking new opportunities for expansion in other countries in Southeast Asia.</p>
      <p>The Indonesian decacorn is aiming to have 1,000 Go-Ride motorcycle shelters across the country by 2020 by focusing on crowded areas across all the regions where it operates in Indonesia, the head of transport, Raditya Wibowo, said on Friday.</p>
      <p>"We will bring the shelters to most crowded points like train stations or bus shelters," he said on the sidelines of the third NextICorn International Summit in Jimbaran, Bali.</p>
      <p>The firm has now established 12 to 15 shelters in Jakarta, Surabaya in East Java and Bandung in West Java, Raditya said. The company is also partnering with mass transportation operators like MRT Jakarta and Kereta Commuter Line Indonesia (KCI) to reduce traffic jams near the stations that often stem from <i>ojek </i>(motorcycle taxi) drivers waiting around for their passengers, he said. </p>
      <p>Aside from improving its services in Indonesia, the on-demand services platform is also preparing to enter the Malaysian market in January 2020 following approval from that country's transport minister's for it to start its <i>ojek</i>-hailing operations with a local partner, Dego Ride.</p>
      <p>Despite the approval, Raditya said the company still faces challenges in planting the <i>ojek</i>-riding culture as a form of transportation for the people in Malaysia.</p>
      <p>"Riding an <i>ojek </i>for the first time can be a scary experience for some, so we need to come up with a solution that can be received well by the customers and drivers [in Malaysia]," he said, adding that unlike in other countries where Gojek has expanded, like Vietnam and Thailand, Malaysians did not traditionally use motorcycles as taxis.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, he continued, the company would look for opportunities for expansion in other countries in Southeast Asia.</p>
