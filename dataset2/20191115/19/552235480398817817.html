      <p>A man has been arrested after the body of a Scottish mum was found stuffed in a wheelie bin in Sussex.</p>
      <p>Nicola Stevenson, from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/police-release-new-photo-missing-20869565">Edinburgh</a> , was found in a green household bin with a fatal head wound.</p>
      <p>Detectives said the mum-of-two could have been lying in the bin, hidden by undergrowth for more than a fortnight.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/glasgow-man-rushed-hospital-nasty-20886380">Police</a> have arrested a second man on suspicion of murder.</p>
      <p>According to her <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/incestuous-mum-shared-chilling-facebook-20869409">Facebook</a> page, Ms Stevenson was a recovering cancer patient who went to Balerno High School.</p>
      <p>A post mortem established the 39-year-old died following blunt force trauma to the head.</p>
      <p>Her body was found by a dog walker at the recreation ground off Landport Road at 12.30 on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Sussex Police said despite no formal identification they are satisfied the body is Ms Stevenson and her next-of-kin have been informed.</p>
      <p>Her final Facebook post was made on October 9.</p>

      <p>The wheelie bin had been pushed into undergrowth at the edge of the park at the edge of Lewes in East Sussex.</p>
      <p>Following the discovery on Wednesday, police initially treated her death as unexplained.</p>
      <p>A murder inquiry was launched after a examination showed Ms Stevenson had suffered a serious head injury.</p>
      <p>A neighbour who asked not to be named said she heard screams behind her home late one night several weeks ago near to where a police cordon is still in place.</p>
      <p>She said: "It's been horrendous.</p>
      <p>"We spoke when she first moved here about a year ago.</p>
      <p>"I thought she had gone away and we haven't seen her for four or five weeks."</p>
      <p>Detective Chief Inspector Chris Friday of Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team said: "Our thoughts at this time are with Nicola's family and friends and we are determined to seek justice for them.</p>
      <p>"Nicola died following a significant blow to the head.</p>
      <p>"Her body had been placed in the wheelie bin and dumped in the undergrowth and we want to establish when that happened and when she was last seen alive.</p>
      <p>"We know that the bin was probably there on November 1 and we are now trying to establish when Nicola was last seen alive.</p>
      <p>"Our initial appeal prompted a number of calls around the wheelie bin and I would like to thank everyone who has called in.</p>
      <p>"We would still welcome any more information around any aspect of the investigation, but I am really interested to hear from anyone who saw her after around the first week of October."</p>
      <p>A 41-year-old man of no fixed address was arrested in Lewes on Thursday morning on suspicion of murder.</p>

      <p>It is believed he is known to the victim.</p>
      <p>On Thursday evening, a 37-year-old man of no fixed address was arrested in a car park in Langney Road, Eastbourne, also on suspicion of her murder.</p>
      <p>Both men remain in custody.</p>
      <p>DCI Chris Friday said: "We are very keen to hear from anyone who may be missing a green wheely-bin or who may have seen it lying in undergrowth at the scene over the last few weeks, but thought no more of it.</p>
      <p>"There were a considerable number of people in the area for one of the Bonfire Night firework displays and we would particularly like to hear from them if they saw anything."</p>
      <p>Search and forensic teams continue to work at the recreation ground and also at Nicola's home in nearby Stansfield Road.</p>
      <p>It is hoped that the current cordon will be reduced by the weekend.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information is asked to quote Operation Stafford.</p>
