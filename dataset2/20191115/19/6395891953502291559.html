      <p><b>WASHINGTONÂ (AP)</b> - Government regulators have again warned Dollar Tree's parent company about importing drugs and cosmetics that could be tainted due to improper product testing during manufacturing.</p>
      <p>The Food and Drug Administration said that Greenbrier International also did not properly perform its own lab analyses as required before releasing certain products, including an anti-dandruff shampoo and an acne face wash. The products were also mislabeled by the Chinese manufacturers.</p>
      <p>The FDA told Greenbrier about violations at the Chinese companies as early as 2017. The FDA's Nov. 6 warning to Greenbrier International says that the company continued to receive products from companies on "import alert," even after Greenbrier International agreed not to.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the Chesapeake, Virginia-based Dollar Tree said the company is cooperating with the FDA.</p>
