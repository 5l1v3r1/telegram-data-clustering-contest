      <h1>Lives on the line: Canada's stem cell registry lacks ethnic diversity in donor pool</h1>

      <p>It’s no wonder five-year-old Tanner McLeod is infatuated with superheroes,considering he’s looking for a hero of his own.</p>
      <p>Tanner was diagnosed with a rare blood disease called sideroblastic anemia at six months old and his family has been searching for a stem cell donor ever since.</p>
      <p>He can’t play like other kids his age as he struggles with fatigue, decreased appetite and a weak immune system. Many of his days are spent attached to a machine pumping fresh blood into his little body. </p>
      <p>In order to beat the disease, he has to find his “genetic twin” and receive a stem cell transplant. However, the chances of doing so are nearly impossible.</p>
      <p>His mom, dad and brother weren’t a match — despite a 25 per cent likelihood of matching with a sibling — and no suitable donor has been found in the Canadian stem cell registry of about 450,000 people, or the global registry of roughly 29 million.</p>
      <p>The young boy is from the Pimicikamak Cree Nation, also known as Cross Lake in Manitoba, and he is significantly more likely to find a match within his own Indigenous community.</p>
      <p>The Canadian registry through Canadian Blood Services (CBS) lacks a diverse donor pool, with two-thirds of registrants being Caucasian. First Nations, Metis and Inuit potential donors account for only 1.3 per cent of registrants.</p>
      <p>It’s the reason his mom, Miranda McLeod, and others across the country are organizing community donor drives to encourage ethnically-diverse individuals to join the national registry. It’s why McLeod remains optimistic.</p>
      <p>“I’m pretty confident his match will be found sooner or later,” she said.</p>
      <p>Stem cells — which are immature cells that transform into red or white blood cells and platelets — are used to treat diseases and conditions of the blood and immune system such as leukemia, lymphoma and aplastic anemia. In order to find a match, a patient and donor must have almost identical DNA markers called Human Leukocyte Antigens.</p>

      <p>Some are luckier than others.</p>
      <p>Susan Nguyen, for example, was a match for her younger brother Bille Nguyen who was diagnosed with T-cell lymphoma in 2018. He was given a 10 per cent chance of survival without a stem cell transplant and finding a Vietnamese-Chinese match had discouraging odds as well.</p>
      <p>The aggressive cancer forced Bille to undergo multiple rounds of chemotherapy but, despite treatment, the cancer continued to spread. His immune system was on the brink of failure.</p>
      <p>The news launched Susan into action, travelling the country and posting on social media to encourage members of the Asian community to get swabbed. She estimates over 1,000 people have signed up since the campaign began.</p>
      <p>In the midst of it, Susan was given “the best news ever” — she could save her brother’s life.</p>
      <p>“It was such a rollercoaster ride,” she said. “Multiple times I went into the dark side and just kind of crawled into a corner and lost hope.”</p>
      <p>Even when Bille was given the green light, ill health forced delays for the transplant. Finally, on Halloween day last year, Susan made the donation, and while her brother isn’t “out of the woods yet,” he’s recovering well.</p>

      <p>It would have been easy for her to stop encouraging others to donate after that, but with a strong momentum and an organic movement bubbling she continued to advocate for others to join the registry.</p>
      <p>“Anytime I hear somebody who’s going through what we did, it just brings back all those horrible feelings, that roller coaster ride and the darkness,” said Nguyen. “It just seemed like the right thing to do, to continue.”</p>
      <p>Through partnering with other families Nguyen has found success and heartbreak, with some individuals losing their battles with disease and others being given a second chance. Another person fortunate to find a hero was Adrienne San Juan’s teenage sister Roshlind Mance, who faced difficult odds in finding a life-saving donor of Filipino descent.</p>
      <p>“Our world came crashing down when we found out that only one per cent of Canada’s stem cell database is comprised of Filipino donors,” said San Juan. But through tireless advocacy and multiple donor drives in Western Canada, a match was found.</p>
      <p>Much like Nguyen, the experience motivated San Juan to continue to raise awareness and ignite action.</p>
      <p>She is now a territory manager with CBS, organizing swabbing campaigns across Western Canada.</p>
      <p>“I still see my sister in those patients. I still put 110 per cent of myself into helping each family find a match,” said San Juan. “It’s really heartbreaking because they know that there is a cure for these people, but it’s just the fact of finding that one specific person who will be able to help them.”</p>

      <p>She thinks non-Caucasian communities aren’t represented in the national registry due to lack of awareness and understanding of the procedure, in addition to cultural differences.</p>
      <p>In the Philippines, for example, San Juan said there’s nothing like a stem cell registry so many Filipino-Canadians have no idea it exists in Canada. You can also be paid to donate blood in the island nation, whereas there is no financial gain here.</p>
      <p>Culturally, she noted, there are also some ethnic groups that believe when they die, everything they have must go with them.</p>
      <p>Part of San Juan’s role is to break down these barriers and explain how becoming a donor is easy, painless and potentially life-saving for someone in need.</p>
      <p>There are three ways to donate stem cells: through peripheral (circulating) blood, umbilical cord blood and bone marrow. The first option involves a procedure similar to a blood transfusion and the latter involves a short surgery in which stem cells are collected near the back of the pelvic bone.</p>
      <p>Cord blood is collected after a healthy baby is born from the placenta and umbilical cord. It’s the most viable source, considering the cells are immature and allow for less strict matching. That helps people who are having difficulties finding a “genetic twin,” such as mixed-race and Indigenous patients, explained Dr. Heidi Elmoazzen, director of stem cells for CBS.</p>
      <p>In Alberta, all donor stem cell transplants are conducted in Calgary at the Tom Baker Cancer Centre and retrieval of cord blood donations takes place at the Lois Hole Hospital for Women in Edmonton.</p>
      <p>Dr. Mona Shafey, lead bone marrow physician with Alberta Health Services, said anywhere between 80 and 100 stem cell transplants are completed each year, and the numbers keep growing with new applications on the horizon, such as treating sickle cell disease.</p>

      <p>Both Shafey and Elmoazzen note that attracting donors is key in helping Canada’s ethnically-diverse population fight a number of diseases, but another important factor is educating registrants on the commitment that accompanies the action of signing up to be a donor.</p>
      <p>Elmoazzen said as many as 50 per cent of registered donors who match with a patient don’t follow through, further reducing the potential for patients to receive a transplant.</p>
      <p>And that, she said, is unacceptable.</p>
      <p>There are about 920 patients currently awaiting a match in Canada, one of which is little Tanner.</p>
      <p>While superheroes are a nice distraction for the young boy who undergoes transfusions every three weeks, his mother continues to hope a real hero saves him soon.</p>

      <h3>Join Canada’s lifeline: How to become a stem cell donor</h3>
      <p>Joining the national stem cell network is easy.</p>
      <p>All applicants need to do is register to donate at <a href="https://www.blood.ca/en">www.blood.ca</a> and complete a health screening questionnaire. Once this is complete, registrants will be sent a swabbing kit to collect a DNA sample, which is then returned to Canadian Blood Services. Applicants will be notified once they are officially part of the stem cell network.</p>
      <p>Registering as a stem cell donor is a long-term commitment and matching a patient in need can take days, weeks, months and even years — if ever. The national agency will contact a donor if they are a potential match.</p>
      <p>
        <b>So, you’re a match. Now what?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Step 1: A registered nurse will go through a comprehensive health assessment to make sure the registrant can safely donate.</p>
      <p>Step 2: If approved, the donor is then required to undergo a physical examination and routine medical tests.</p>
      <p>Step 3: Once confirmed as medically eligible, the donor must consent to donation and begin pre-transplant treatments. They will donate stem cells one of two ways: through the peripheral blood or bone marrow.</p>
      <p>Step 4: Stem cells are collected and transferred to the recipient patient.</p>

      <h3>Myth busting: Stem cell transplants</h3>
      <p>Donor advocates say a variety of reasons exist as to why Canadians are hesitant to join the stem cell registry. One of the most prevalent is misinformation about the procedure. Here are some myths they’re hoping to dispel.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Myth: Stem cells are taken from the spinal cord</b>
      </p>
      <p>There are three sources for stem cell donation: Peripheral (circulating) blood, bone marrow or umbilical cord blood. In the case of a bone marrow donation, stem cells are collected from the iliac crest, which sits at the back of the pelvic bone. The spinal cord is unaffected. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Myth: All stem cell donations involve surgery</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bone marrow donation is the only surgical procedure.</p>
      <p>Peripheral blood donation, which makes up the majority of cases, is a non-surgical procedure where a donor’s blood is removed through a sterile needle in one arm. <a href="https://www.blood.ca/en/stem-cells/donating-cord-blood/donation-process">Cord blood donation</a> is the least invasive method and is collected from the umbilical cord following the birth of a healthy baby.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Myth: Stem cell donation is painful and involves a lengthy recovery process</b>
      </p>
      <p>Donors do not experience pain during any of the stem cell donation procedures, according to Canadian Blood Services. Recovery varies depending on the type of donation, but generally donors are back to their usual routine within a few days or, at most, a few weeks.</p>
      <p>Bone marrow donors are expected to feel some soreness in their lower back and some people have reported feeling tired or having discomfort walking. Peripheral blood donors have reported symptoms including headaches, bone or muscle pain, nausea, insomnia and fatigue, but the effects usually disappear shortly after donating.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Myth: Stem cells are not replaced once they are donated</b>
      </p>
      <p>The human body replaces stem cells within six weeks.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Myth: Someone needing a stem cell transplant can easily find a match within their family</b>
      </p>
      <p>Only 25 per cent of people are likely to find a match within their family.</p>
