      <h2>Raheem Sterling confronted Joe Gomez during an England training camp which led to the Man City superstar being dropped by Gareth Southgate</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T19:21:27+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 19:21</time> by <a rel="author">Robbie Savage, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/robbie-savage/</a></address>
      <p>Gareth Southgate has made his first mistake as England manager by over-reacting to the spat between Raheem Sterling and Joe Gomez.</p>
      <p>From World Cup semi-finalist to qualifying for Euro 2020 at a breeze, Southgate had barely put a foot wrong – until now.</p>
      <p>Some pundits thought his handling of the episode was right – but I thought it was poor because, in my opinion, it was a halfway-house cop-out.</p>
      <p>If Southgate felt Sterling was so out of order to confront Gomez in the players’ canteen at St George’s Park, why didn’t he send him home and leave him out of both England’s games in this international break?</p>
      <p>Or why not just nip it in the bud, read the riot act behind closed doors and move on?</p>

      <p>Forget about England winning 7-0. That’s irrelevant. By leaving Sterling – one of the top four or five players in the world on current form – out of the squad against Montenegro, Southgate got the worst of all worlds. Nobody is a winner.</p>
      <p>Gomez was booed by some England fans when he came on at Wembley on Thursday night, even though he’s done nothing wrong.</p>
      <p>The booing and scrutiny on him all week could have been avoided if the incident hadn’t been made public.</p>
      <p>Sterling looked plain awkward as he clapped Gomez on to the pitch from his seat in the stands, knowing the TV cameras would be trained on him.</p>

      <p>He will return to the side in Kosovo this weekend, with his manager saying how well he’s trained, but if I were in Raheem Sterling’s shoes, I would have lost a bit of respect for Southgate.</p>
      <p>The England coach has jeopardised his relationship with his best player – who admitted he had overstepped the mark.</p>
      <p>And I don’t see how the manager’s authority has been enhanced by punishing his best player and making him sit out England’s 1,000th game with so many great players from the past on parade.</p>
      <p>Fights between players is nothing new. It goes on all the time in football. I’ve seen fists fly and people turning on each other from Manchester United’s Class of ’92 to Leicester, Birmingham and Blackburn.</p>
      <p>And I’ve seen much worse outcomes than the scratch Gomez allegedly collected from the altercation.</p>

      <p>I don’t condone fisticuffs between team-mates but it’s been going on behind the scenes for years. Rightly or wrongly, emotions run high in football, and these things happen.</p>
      <p>I speak from personal experience of being stood down from an international squad because I was sent home, on the morning of Wales’ Euro 2000 qualifier against Italy for tossing a replica of Paolo Maldini’s shirt into a bin for a stunt.</p>
      <p>It was only a prank, I was young and naïve, I was only trying to make fun of the fact that I was at Crewe, driving a Ford Fiesta, and he was a legend who drove a Ferrari. I was egged on by others, and I shouldn’t have done it, but I didn’t mean any harm.</p>
      <p>Bobby Gould, the Wales manager with whom I had an excellent relationship, sent me home at 5am. I was told if I didn’t leave the team hotel, the police would be called to escort me off the premises.</p>

      <p>I was shocked and in tears, but I was called back into the squad after the other players stood up for me and said I should be let back in.</p>
      <p>Although I was on the bench, there was attention on me because the story had leaked out – and Sterling will find there is more scrutiny on him in Kosovo.</p>
      <p>So Gomez gets booed unfairly, Sterling will be under the microscope more than ever and Southgate has generated extra pressure on himself where England should be enjoying safe passage to Euro 2020 and making it look a doddle.</p>
      <p>As others have remarked: Would Sterling have been dropped if it had been a win-or-bust qualifier or a knockout game at a major tournament?</p>
      <p>If the answer is ‘No’ – as I suspect would have been the case – then Southgate has got it wrong.</p>
      <p>Yes, he has stamped his authority on the job... but if you are going to discipline a star player, you have to send him home instead of including him in the group and saying how well he has trained all week and then making him watch from the naughty step in the stands.</p>
      <p>Southgate’s halfway house will do him no favours in the long run. Who was the winner?</p>
      <p>In any dressing room, there are going to be players who dislike each other, and on international duty there will be scores to settle from club rivalries.</p>
      <p>Woe betide an England manager who risks the team spirit amongst his squad by trying to solve feuds which began in club football.</p>
