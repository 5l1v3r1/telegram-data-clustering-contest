      <p><i>The Dragon Prince</i> follows two exiled princes in the fantasy world of Xadia, teamed with an elven assassin named Rayla, escorting a baby dragon to bring peace between humans and elves and avert a coming war.

      <p>"It could vary. We like how it feels right now with those nine episodes but if it needs to be a little bit longer or whatever, then we'll absolutely do that," observed Richmond. "But yeah, around that length, I think, is correct."</p>
      <p>Featuring the voices of Jack DeSena as Callum, Sasha Rojen as Ezran, Paula Burrows as Rayla, Jesse Inocalla as Soren, Racquel Belmonte as Claudia, Luc Roderique as King Harrow of Katolis and Jason Simpson as Viren, <i>The Dragon Prince </i>Seasons 1 and 2 are available now on Netflix. <a href="https://screenrant.com/dragon-prince-season-3-release-date-story-details/">Season 3</a> arrives Nov. 22.</p>
