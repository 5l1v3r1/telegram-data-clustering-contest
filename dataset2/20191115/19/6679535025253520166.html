      <h1>BDO orders cleaning of water tanks in defunct dyeing units</h1>

      <p>As part of the anti-dengue drive carried out by the District Administration, Block Development Officer V. Kanagaraj ordered the cleaning of water tanks in 10 defunct dyeing units at Mudalipalayam here.</p>
      <p>The order, which was issued on Thursday, gave the garment companies time till Saturday to clean the tanks. “The units have been non-functional since 2011,” he said.</p>
      <p>As the units had abandoned the water tanks that were earlier used for purification of effluents, rainwater began to stagnate in these tanks, enabling breeding of mosquitoes, Mr. Kanagaraj said.</p>
      <p>Strict action would be taken if the tanks were not cleaned by Saturday, he added.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, officials severed the water connection of a house at Mudalipalayam here on Thursday as the residents allegedly did not cooperate with them during the anti-dengue drive. “We wanted to check the house for mosquito breeding, but the tenants, two north Indians employed in a garment unit, did not allow us inside,” he said.</p>
