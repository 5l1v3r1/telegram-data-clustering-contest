      <h1>Iowa vs. Minnesota: Game Time, Spread, Channel, Announcers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T19:54:10+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 19:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>The Big Ten slate on Saturday features a marquee game with two ranked teams. No. 8 Minnesota at No. 20 Iowa will certainly garner plenty of attention this weekend.</p>
      <p>Undefeated Minnesota wasn’t expected to be lossless at this point in the season. But here the Golden Gophers are.</p>
      <p>P.J. Fleck’s squad shocked the college football world last Saturday, <a href="https://thespun.com/big-ten/minnesota/minnesota-penn-state-upset-win-college-football-playoff-rankings-undefeated">beating then-No. 4 Penn State</a>. As a result, the Golden Gophers jumped up to No. 8 in the latest College Football Playoff rankings. Many feel that ranking is still too low.</p>
      <p>This Minnesota team is to be taken seriously. And the Golden Gophers look to make another statement on Saturday against the Iowa Hawkeyes.</p>
      <p>Iowa is 6-3 (3-3) through nine games this season. The Hawkeyes don’t have much of a shot at a Big Ten title. But taking down Minnesota would certainly be an impressive feat.</p>

      <p><b>Channel:</b> FOX</p>
      <p>

      <p>Minnesota may be the higher ranked team on Saturday, but the Hawkeyes are a 3-point favorite at home. This is expected to be a low scoring affair on Saturday.</p>

      <p>Iowa won last year’s game in Minneapolis 48-31, and is riding a four-game winning streak in the battle for Floyd of Rosedale, one of the Big Ten’s best trophies.</p>
