      <h1>Texas at Iowa State: Game Time, Spread, Channel, Announcers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T19:37:43+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 19:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>The 19th ranked Texas Longhorns are gearing up for a Big 12 road contest against the Iowa State Cyclones.</p>
      <p>Texas currently sits at 6-3 with a 4-2 record in conference play. The Longhorns are still alive in the Big 12 conference race, but must win on Saturday to keep those hopes alive. They’ll also need help from the first place Baylor Bears – who still have games against Oklahoma and Texas – to have a shot to play in the conference title game.</p>
      <p>This hasn’t been the season most Texas fans were hoping for. But there’s still plenty to play for and a Big 12 championship isn’t out of the question. The Longhorns are back into the most recent College Football Playoff rankings, <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/the-college-football-playoff-rankings-after-week-11-have-been-released">at No. 19</a>.</p>
      <p>As for Iowa State, the Cyclones would love to spoil the Longhorns’ Big 12 hopes on Saturday. Matt Campbell has led his team to a 5-4 start with three wins and three losses in conference games.</p>
      <p>Iowa State has struggled against the league’s best teams including losses to Baylor, Oklahoma and Oklahoma State. But will the Cyclones use those losses to fuel their effort on Saturday?</p>
