      <p>People who live close to the scene of the tragedy were reportedly being escorted by officers to and from their homes as they passed the location of the incident earlier today, reports <a href="https://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/news/local-news/man-dies-after-getting-trapped-3544714">Leicestershire Live.</a></p>
      <p>A green tent was erected in front of one of the houses in the street this afternoon, and officers were seen going in and out of it.</p>
      <p>Police cars were spotted in various locations across the estate, including in Rouen Way and Toulouse Place.</p>
      <p>Residents have been making cups of tea for the officers to help keep them warm.</p>
      <p>The estate itself is the biggest in Ashby, and is a vast and largely quiet area.</p>
      <p>The police spokesman said a file on the death was being prepared for the coroner.</p>
