      <h1>VIDEO: Times Dragon Ball's Goten Was Heavily Underestimated</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T19:11:04+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 19:11</time> by <a rel="author">L.D. Nolan</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/dragon-ball/">Dragon Ball</a> franchise has undergone some pretty big changes over the years, introducing major character after major character to its ever growing cast. Among those new characters was Goten, who played a pretty key role in the Buu Saga, learning to fuse with Trunks. Although Goten tends to get overshadowed by other characters in the series, he's one of the strongest fighters on Earth and capable of some pretty stunning feats. In our new exclusive video, we've catalogued ten times that Goten was heavily underestimated in the <i>Dragon Ball </i>franchise and went on to prove just how awesome he was.</p>
      <p>We're starting our list off with a comparison between Gohan And Goten's training. The former was mostly trained by Piccolo, who took a pretty aggressive approach, with his lessons including such things as running away from dinosaurs. Gohan worked hard to train Goten differently, and the latter proved he was capable of going toe-to-toe with his older brother, revealing that he'd actually learned how to use the Super Saiyan form at an incredibly young age. This shocks Gohan, who spent a lot of time training to become a Super Saiyan.</p>

      <p>Although <i>Dragon Ball Super </i>has finished its run, <i>Super Dragon Ball Heroes </i>is helping tide fans over in the short-term, but it's <a href="https://screenrant.com/dragon-ball-super-future-movies-tv/">unknown at this time</a> just when the series will return with new episodes, or if it will adapt the current "Galactic Prisoner Saga" that's going on in the manga. Still, the franchise seems unlikely to stay gone for long, as it's remained one of the most popular media properties in the world for decades.</p>
