      <p>BioWare is revamping Anthem, according to a report.</p>
      <p>Sources speaking with Kotaku have said <b>Anthem</b> is getting a complete overhaul.</p>
      <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/sources-bioware-plans-a-complete-overhaul-for-anthem-1839892415">According to the report</a>, the studio has dubbed it as Anthem 2.0 or Anthem Next.</p>
      <p>The studio is apparently working to “drastically” changing loot,  he world, and mission structure. According to one source, the team has spent a few months “tearing it down and figuring out what needed to change fundamentally,” and rebuilding for months afterward.</p>
      <p>At present, the studio has yet to decide whether the changes will be released at once or over a specific time period.</p>
      <p>BioWare has said in the past, <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/09/17/anthem-acts-structure-moving-away/">more than once</a>, it was <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/09/06/anthem-fundamental-improvements-in-the-works-at-bioware/">working on long-term changes</a> to the game, but wasn’t ready to discuss said changes. It did, however, state core issues with the game would be addressed.</p>
