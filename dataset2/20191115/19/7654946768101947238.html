        <i>She shoots Showtime’s “Billions” by day and stars in Broadway’s “Tootsie” at night, so Sarah Stiles makes the most out of whatever free time she has. The actress, who puppeteered Lucy the Slut in Broadway’s “Avenue Q,” arrived here in 1999 fresh from rural New Hampshire. “I started off on the Upper West Side and ended up living in every borough since then,” says Stiles, 40, who’s back again on the Upper West Side, where she lives with her boyfriend. She tells The Post where you’ll find her between gigs.</i>

      <p>This time of year, all I want are treats and warm things. Greenpoint, where we’re shooting “Billions,” has great coffee shops. I love <a href="https://sweetleafcoffee.com/">Sweetleaf</a>. My favorite coffee is the Rocket Fuel, which has chicory and maple syrup. When I’m feeling bored, [it gives me] a pow wham ka-zam pick-me-up.</p>
      <p>The best part of my week is a two-hour session with my acupuncturist and massage therapist, <a href="https://jeffvandykemassagetherapynewyork.com/">Jeffrey VanDyke</a>. I’ve been seeing him since “Avenue Q,” and I go to him every chance I get. He’s in Chelsea, so I can walk to <a href="https://www.foragersmarket.com/">Foragers Market</a>. I stumbled on it one day when I wanted to pick up some things for my dressing room. Cheeses and olives and kombucha — they’ve got all that. I’ll always get their coffee: an oat-milk flat white is my new obsession.</p>
      <p>My favorite store is the <a href="http://www.namastebookshop.com/">Namaste Bookshop</a> on 14th Street. It’s a crystal and tarot card shop with books on alternative healing. I grew up very hippie — I have woo-woo parents — so that makes me feel comfortable. I always get Christmas presents there. I’ve also found some incredible stuff at the booths they set up at Christmas time in the back of Chelsea Market, like pigeon cuff links and catch-all accessory bags made from recycled materials that say “No, YOU act normal,” with a picture of a girl doing yoga with a squirrel on her head. Somehow they just know what you need, right?</p>
      <p>Every Sunday before the [“Tootsie”] matinee, I go to <a href="http://shapehouse.com/">Shape House</a> on West 86th Street. It’s an urban sweat lodge. They put you in an infrared bed and zip you up in this sleeping-bag thing. They put headphones on you and you watch television, drink water and sweat. It’s relaxing for the first 10 minutes, then your heart starts racing, but it sheds all the toxins out of you. They give you oranges and ginger tea after, and it’s delicious.</p>
      <p>If I do have a day off, I have to move and exercise. I love <a href="https://barre3.com/">Barre3</a> on West Eighth Street and Sixth Avenue. I met this incredible teacher there, Dino Malvone, who just opened his own studio, <a href="https://www.thesaltdrop.com/">SaltDrop</a>. He is this magical unicorn person — you walk into his studio and by the time you leave, you feel like you’re strong and powerful and that you can accomplish anything — and the world is a better place!</p>
