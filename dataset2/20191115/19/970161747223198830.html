        <b>After discovering that Ste Hay (Kieron Richardson) was hellbent on escaping the far-right organisation in Hollyoaks, extremists Stuart Sumner (Chris Simmons) and Jonny Baxter (Ray Quinn) sought revenge on the young man during <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/05/hollyoaks-spoilers-dies-far-right-extremism-clifftop-climax-11044420/">tonight’s hour-long episode</a>. Matters got out of hand rather quickly and, when it looked like it could really be curtains for Ste, Stuart’s own son Sid (Billy Price) ultimately came to the rescue.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ste had a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/07/hollyoaks-spoilers-leela-and-peri-lomax-plot-to-save-ste-hay-from-the-far-right-group-but-are-they-in-danger-11062767/">plan in place to escape from the far-right organisation</a>. However, what he didn’t bargain for was Jonny, who — after delivering a series of compelling performances — managed to get Ste to open up about his getaway plan.</p>
      <p>After relaying this information to Stuart, the leader of the organisation <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/hollyoaks-spoilers-ste-hay-murdered-as-far-right-storyline-reaches-its-shocking-climax-11025770/">set about finishing Ste off once and for all</a> — something which Sid overheard. The young lad headed off to get help in the form of Peri (Ruby O’Donnell) and Leela (Kirsty-Leigh Porter), but before they could save their relative, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/hollyoaks-spoilers-kidnap-horror-for-ste-hay-as-stuart-sumner-seeks-revenge-11025578/">Stuart and Jonny kidnapped him and hightailed it out of there</a>.</p>

      <p>Stuart was determined to see his revenge through to the bitter end, as Ste <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/hollyoaks-spoilers-ste-hay-dies-as-the-far-right-storyline-reaches-its-climax-11125399/">teetered on the edge of a cliff</a>, but — as Sid watched on in horror — the young man took it upon himself to end the nightmare once and for all, and thus pushed Stuart over the edge of the cliff.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Speaking to Metro.co.uk about what resulted in Sid taking such drastic action, actor Billy Price said: ‘I think what’s going through his head is to save Ste, because as much as Ste is part of the group, he’s been groomed into it all. I think him and Sid get quite close towards the end and he feels as if they’re both in kind of the same situation, as Sid’s been brought up in this lifestyle, and Ste’s been dragged into this lifestyle — and there’s no escape for either of them. So, they’ve got to work as a team to get out of it because neither of them want to be part of it anymore.’</p>
      <p>In addition to Sid’s desire to rescue Ste, viewers have also seen the young lad conflicted over his feelings towards his dad and his extremist views. Stuart has intimidated and bullied him on occasion — and recently hit him when he didn’t comply with a request.</p>
      <p>What’s more, his dad’s actions have resulted in Sid being isolated at school — in spite of the fact that he had no part in the explosion at the Maaliks. All of that pent-up anger and aggression no doubt also played a part in Sid putting an end to his dad.</p>

      <p>Billy said: ‘I always say you’re a product of your own environment. Sid’s been brought up around them views. If your parents tell you ‘this is right and this right’ and then you’re going to just believe it, as that’s what your parents say and you think they’re always right.’</p>

      <p>‘I think that plays a huge part in what happens at the end, because — as much as what happens is horrible, it’s kind of relief. As much as that’s not how Sid wants it to end — he doesn’t want anyone to die or anything — there’s no other way out. As we’ve seen, Ste’s got no way out, Sid’s got no way out, and the only way out is just for him to end it.’</p>

      <p>However, while this is very much the end of the far-right storyline, it’s only the beginning for Sid — in more ways than one, as the young lad will not only be remaining on our screens for the foreseeable, but he’ll also find himself struggling to come to terms with the events that transpired during this episode.</p>
      <p>Billy said: ‘Sid is still struggling with what he’s done, and I think you would if that did happen. There would be all kinds of things going through your head, because as much as it’s an accident, you’ve killed the hand that’s fed you. That’s a thing to get your head around, for definite.’</p>
      <p>However, make no mistake, that’s not the only reason he’ll be sticking around, as viewers will be given the opportunity to see Sid grow into his own person, make his own life choices, and really experience life for the first time now that he’s free from his dad’s negative influence.</p>

      <p>On Sid’s future, Billy said: ‘I think now that his dad’s gone, Sid can find himself as his own person. Get to make his own opinions about life, his own views, and he can like who he wants to like. He has that freedom now to just be his own person, which is really nice because that gives me a chance as an actor and Sid, as a character, to play with all the new stuff that he hasn’t been able to do before.’</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘Hollyoaks are definitely exploring his vulnerability quite a lot, so it’s really nice as an actor to be a part of that.  There is so much area there for them to explore with Sid — what happened with his dad, the vulnerability, the relationships he’s never been able to have, the views that he used to have that he now needs to get over. There’s literally so much and I think it’ll be a great chance for them to create a new character that everyone wants to get to know.’</p>
      <p>Of course, viewers have also seen Sid <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/09/hollyoaks-spoilers-romance-revealed-for-juliet-quinn-and-sid-sumner-as-they-go-on-a-date-11068567/">develop a relationship with Juliet</a> (Niamh Blackshaw), and although their date didn’t really go according to plan thanks to Stuart’s control, the dynamic between the two characters worked incredibly well, and Billy reckons we could see them continue to develop that bond in the future.</p>

      <p>He said: ‘The relationship with Juliet — he hasn’t really been able to have relationships before because of his parents’ views, so it’s a really nice journey for Sid, because as much as he’s got to come to terms with it all, he’s starting to have new life experiences. ‘</p>
      <p>‘I think both Juliet and Sid have had a difficult time with their parents — their parents told them ‘this is right’, and it’s been a hard upbringing for both of them, but I think when they’re together, they bring the best out in each other, and I think they can help each other through it, because they know what it feels like to be judged by their parents’ actions.’</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘I think it’s really nice because there’s a side to Juliet and a side to Sid that no-one’s ever seen before, so I think it’s a real good chance for the audience to realise that these are just kids who’ve been brought up in a bad environment, but that they’re actually good at heart.’</p>
