      <h1>'Joker' Crosses $1 Billion at Global Box Office</h1>
      <h2>Batman villain origin story is first R-rated film to surpass the landmark total</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T19:50:27+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 19:50</time> by <a rel="author">Jeremy Fuster, Brian Welk, Beatrice Verhoeven</a></address>
      <p>“Joker” has exceeded even the wildest of expectations doing what no R-Rated film has done before: gross $1 billion at the global box office.</p>
      <p>The film is set to surpass the worldwide mark on Friday, currently sitting at $999 million and change, including $317 million domestically. This makes it the seventh Warner Bros. film to do cross that mark</p>
      <p>“Joker” joins last year’s “Aquaman” ($1.14 billion) and the two Christopher Nolan Batman sequels, “The Dark Knight” ($1 billion) and “The Dark Knight Rises” ($1.08 billion) to cross the $1 billion. The other movies are “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Pt. 2,” ($1.34 billion), “Lord of the Rings: Return of the King” ($1.12 billion) and “The Hobbit: The Unexpected Journey” ($1.01 billion).</p>
      <p>Right now “Joker” sits just behind “The Dark Knight” on the all-time box office earners at no. 44.</p>

      <p>Todd Phillips directed the film that starred Joaquin Phoenix in an origin story about the iconic Batman villain, and it has had a remarkable run since it won the top prize at the Venice International Film Festival.</p>
      <p>Domestically, “Joker” opened to a strong but not record-breaking $96 million, but it held on strong and for weeks did not have a weekend-to-weekend drop above 50%. Though it still falls just short of the domestic total set by Warner Bros. and New Line’s horror film “It,” which is also rated R.</p>
      <p>Internationally it’s held on even stronger after opening to $152.2 million, despite lacking the action-heavy appeal that would usually aid it overseas. “Joker” even broke all-time Warner Bros. records across 14 countries, including Russia and Mexico, over $100 million grossed in Latin America, and DC movie records in 34 countries, including Japan, Italy and Argentina.</p>

      <p>Before even its fourth weekend in theaters, “Joker” surpassed “Deadpool 2” as the highest-grossing R-rated film ever, which only managed $785 million worldwide. And the achievement even earned a cheeky response from “Deadpool” star Ryan Reynolds when he tweeted a “Joker” poster with the caption, “You Mother F—er.”</p>
      <p>The next goalpost in “Joker’s” sight is the Oscars, where Joaquin Phoenix is considered a strong contender for the Best Actor prize.</p>

          <figcaption>"Avengers: Endgame" became the highest-grossing film of all time on July 21, when <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/21/avengers-endgame-is-the-highest-grossing-film-of-all-time.html">Disney announced</a> that the movie had pulled in $2.79 billion at the global box office. But the title of the highest-grossing film is a deceptive one -- it doesn't take into account the changing prices of movie theater tickets or the general effect of economic inflation. CNBC enlisted Comscore, a media analytics company, to calculate the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/22/top-10-films-at-the-box-office-when-adjusted-for-inflation.html">top 10 highest-grossing films</a> in the U.S. when ticket price changes and inflation are taken into account.<br/>Because of the wide variations in inflation rates between currencies, Comscore analysts focused only on ticket sales in the United States, where "Endgame" made $854 million<a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=marvel2019.htm"> according to BoxOfficeMojo.</a> They found the average ticket price for the year a film was released and divided that into the film's domestic gross to find the estimated number of tickets the film sold, then multiplied the estimated number of tickets by the average price of a ticket in 2019 ($9.01, according to CNBC). Comscore also included any times that the film was re-released in the adjusted domestic gross.<br/>At an $854 million domestic gross, "Endgame" did not even crack the top 10 when adjusted for inflation. <br/>Here are the top domestic earners:</figcaption>

William Friedkin’s groundbreaking horror film made the bulk of its money during its initial release, according to CNBC, and was brought to theaters again in 2000 and 2010 with extended scenes. All told, the movie sold an estimated 116.5 million tickets, which equates to around $1.04 billion.<cite>Warner Bros.</cite></figcaption>
