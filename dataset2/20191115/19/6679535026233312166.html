      <h2>‘Roads dug by KWA not motorable’</h2>

      <p>The Kerala High Court on Friday asked the Kochi Corporation and the Greater Cochin Development Authority (GCDA) to take steps to repair the potholed roads in the city on a war footing.</p>
      <p>Justice Devan Ramachandran orally observed that there was no proper plan by the authorities concerned regarding the repair of the roads.</p>
      <p>Big craters that had developed on the roads were posing a threat to the lives of two-wheeler riders. Incidents of riders falling into big potholes had become the order of the day.</p>
      <p>The court asked the Corporation to produce records related to steps taken to repair the Pandit Karuppan Road.</p>
      <p>The petitioner alleged that the roads dug by the Kerala Water Authority for laying pipes had not been made motorable. The KWA had informed the court that it had deposited ₹1.7 crore for repairing the roads with the Corporation.</p>
      <p>The court noted that the roads had been in bad condition for long. For how long could the authorities leave the road in such a condition, the court asked. If the road could not be used for vehicular traffic, it should be closed.</p>
      <p>Counsel for the Corporation informed the court that the repair of the Thammanam-Pullepady road was in progress.</p>
      <p>GCDA counsel also submitted that the repair works of the Kaloor-Kadavanthra road would be undertaken in 10 days.</p>
      <p>The court adjourned the petitions for further hearing to November 29.</p>
