      <h1>Convicted sex offender murdered and dismembered in 'revenge and retribution'</h1>

      <p>An inquest into a double homicide heard how a convicted sex offender and his daughter were murdered in a cold act of revenge and retribution.</p>
      <p>Nathaniel Henry, 37, is thought to have strangled and butchered Noel Brown, 69, before killing his daughter, Maria Brown a 41-year-old primary school teacher, when she arrived to check on her father at his Deptford home in south-east London.</p>
      <p>Mr Brown had a history of 12 convictions covering 33 offences, several of which were sexual.</p>
      <p>Their suspected killer was later found dead having been reported missing and not seen or heard from since the two bodies were identified in December, 2017.</p>
      <p>The hearing into the ‘incredibly complex investigation’ concluded Tuesday and today the Met Police went into further detail about the manhunt.</p>
      <p>Officers said they would have pressed murder charges had Henry not died from a suspected overdose, but added that they were not looking for anybody else in connection with the killings.</p>

      <p>DCI Helen Rance said the killings were believed to be linked to one of Mr Brown’s previous offences and had been carried out in ‘revenge or in retribution’, although the specific offence was not disclosed.</p>

      <p>DCI Simon Harding said: ‘It was an incredibly complex investigation with two bodies in one flat and the nature in which Noel was murdered.</p>
      <p>‘Both were strangled but Noel’s body was then dismembered and obviously we didn’t find any of Noel’s body parts.</p>
      <p>‘We had CCTV that was looking at the address but was unfortunately broken and it was an incredibly busy area.’</p>
      <p>Unable to track the killer by conventional methods, the Met turned to the National Crime Agency after DNA and blood from the same unidentified source was found in the house by the two dead bodies.</p>

      <p>With no matching record they searched for similar patterns and DCI Harding said the police used ‘familial DNA to trace unknown DNA found in the house’.</p>
      <p>They found it paired closely with a family member of Henry’s, before inquiries then found he had died and that he had not been seen or heard from since the day the Brown’s bodies were identified.</p>
      <p>DCI Harding said the success of linking the crime to Henry was ‘tinged with frustration and sadness’ at being unable to provide the victims’ family with closure.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘I don’t feel that they feel they have (received closure).</p>
      <p>‘I think anyone in this circumstance would want somebody to face justice in the normal way that we would want in a court, and serve a long sentence for what they did. To be punished.</p>

      <p>‘So I don’t feel that they’re really content with it, which is perfectly understandable. It’s very difficult to not have their time to see that person face justice in the way they probably should have done.’</p>

      <p>DCI Simon Harding added that Mr Brown’s criminal history was unknown by the community prior to his death and he had been out of prison since 2004.</p>
      <p>Henry, who worked as a youth mentor, was described as a ‘true pillar of the community’ by neighbours following his death.</p>
      <h3>Family Statements</h3>
      <p>Sharon Brown, Noel’s daughter, said<b>: ‘</b>The family of Noel Brown would like him to be remembered as a valued man and caring father. This devastating loss has robbed us of his presence unfairly, made worse by the knowledge that no one is being brought to justice for this crime.</p>
      <p>‘Noel Brown was a jovial, kind person who was always known as a loyal friend. He did not deserve to die in this horrific way.</p>
      <p>‘Life has not been the same since we learned of his brutal murder. For the last two years, we have experienced acute shock, severe anxiety and depression, struggling to carry on with our lives when nothing will ever be the same again. It is harder to work, socialise or even feel safe in our homes. When a family member is lost in this way, life can’t go back to what it used to be. We will be haunted for the rest of our lives by this crime and the suffering Noel endured in his final hours.’</p>
      <p>Marie Brown’s half sister Casandra and daughter Vanita said: ‘As a family we have really struggled to come to terms with the death of our lovely Marie. It has been nearly two years since she was taken from us and we are still in pain. All Marie ever did was care for everyone. Even in her final moments of life she was doing her best to care for people. She was extremely kind and gentle – the sort of person to give you the last of anything she had. We will never understand why she was robbed from us. Marie was everything and we miss her so much.</p>
      <p>‘As we said two years ago, to know Marie would be to know how much time she dedicated to her children and how she constantly wanted to help people. Especially her father who she loved and deeply cared for. He was a humble man who was creative and kept to himself. It is a terrible thing that the evil in this world cost us something as innocent as Marie. We thank everyone who came forward with information and we would also like to thank the Met police for carrying out the investigation.</p>
      <p>‘We are grateful for all the support that has been extended to our family during this terrible time. We would now like to privately mourn the loss of Marie and continue with our lives. There are many things that we have started that Marie would have been so proud of and we intend to finish them. Marie’s name will never be forgotten.’</p>
