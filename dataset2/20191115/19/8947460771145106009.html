      <h1>SPIED: BMW i4 caught in camouflage, lookin’ good</h1>
      <h2>Earlier this year, we exclusively revealed some of the tech details around the upcoming BMW i4, the new four-door coupe with the latest BMW EV …</h2>

      <p>The upcoming BMW i4 is going to be the brand’s first all-electric sedan and one that will target mainstream customers and EV fans alike. Finally, BMW will have a pure battery electric vehicle (BEV) that’s actually a normal car, rather than a funky hatchback or bloated crossover. Some new spy photos have also just surfaced showing off a rather handsome design. (We don’t own the photos but see them <a href="https://www.motor1.com/photo/4442736/bmw-i4-spy-photos/">here</a>)</p>
      <p>Sure, the <a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2019/11/08/bmw-offers-50-i3-cars-for-bidirectional-charging-management-project/">BMW i3</a> is a cool car and the upcoming <a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2019/11/12/the-production-model-name-for-bmw-inext-will-reportedly-be-simply-ix/">iNEXT</a> will likely be quite interesting but it’s nice to BMW making an EV that actually looks like a proper BMW. This new BMW i4 will be based on the same modular architecture as the upcoming 4 Series Gran Coupe and it will share a lot of that car’s exterior styling. So it will look quite good, as evidenced by these photos.</p>
      <p>In these photos, the BMW i4 looks sporty and curvaceous, with a four-door “coupe” body style that we’ve come to love from BMW. The previous 4 Series Gran Coupe was and is such a good looking car, so we’re expecting both the next generation version and<a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2019/11/14/report-bmw-i4-80kwh-battery-530-hp-373-mile-range/"> this i4</a> to be even better looking.</p>

      <p>According to some rumored specs, the next-gen BMW i4 will pack an 80 kWh battery pack an will make about 530 hp from its electric motors. It’s also said that it will reach 60 mph in less than four seconds, which isn’t quite as quick as the Tesla Model 3 Performance, it’s still very fast. Also, it’s rumored that the i4 will have around 340-350 miles of range on the US EPA cycle (370-ish miles on European WLTP).</p>
      <p>So BMW make have finally found its Tesla competitor. While there’s still some debate about whether or not BMW can keep up with Tesla, or if it even needs to, there’s no denying the fact that the upcoming BMW i4 will be a direct rival to the Tesla Model 3. It’s going to be around the same size, price and performance, while having similar (if not better) range. It will be very interesting to see what becomes of the i4 in the coming years.</p>
