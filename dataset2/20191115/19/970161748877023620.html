      <p>A pet owner killed his dog with a shotgun as it cowered under a table and sent it’s blood splattering ten feet across his kitchen, police said.</p>
      <p>Richard Jordan, 31, was arrested on Saturday after he allegedly gunned down his pitbull-Labrador mix in front of his girlfriend and children, aged one and two, in Chatfield, Minnesota.</p>
      <p>Police said the incident began when Jordan and his girlfriend got into a fight over finances in their home.</p>
      <p>Jordan knocked the woman down as they struggled over his debit card. The dog then nipped Jordan in the ankle while trying to protect the woman, <a href="https://myfox47.com/2019/11/13/chatfield-man-accused-of-shooting-and-killing-family-dog-in-front-of-two-children/">Fox 47 reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Jordan retrieved a 12 gauge shotgun and found the terrified dog cowering under a kitchen table – then knelt down, aimed at the dog and pulled the trigger.</p>

      <p>Authorities say one of Jordan’s children was just five or six feet away from the dog when it was shot, <a href="https://kttc.com/news/minnesota-news/2019/11/13/chatfield-man-accused-of-shooting-and-killing-family-dog-in-front-of-two-children/">according to KTTC.</a></p>
      <p>Immediately after killing the dog, Jordan began saying it was an accident, his girlfriend told police.</p>
      <p>He then wrapped the dog in blankets, took the shotgun apart and left in his car with the disassembled weapon.</p>
      <p>Jordan was later arrested and told officers that he shot the dog on purpose, claiming he feared for his and his children’s safety.</p>
      <p>He has been charged with one felony count of mistreatment of animals and one felony count of dangerous discharge of a firearm.</p>
      <p>Jordan is also charged with multiple domestic assault related charges.</p>
      <p>If convicted, Jordan faces a up to four years in jail and a $5,000 fine.</p>
