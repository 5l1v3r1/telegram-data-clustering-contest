      <p><b>Warning:</b> <i><b>Hobbs &amp; Shaw</b></i> <b>SPOILERS are below!</b></p>
      <p>Once just a standalone movie, <i>The Fast and the Furious</i> not only launched a massive blockbuster film series, but that series is now a multi-pronged franchise. Over this summer, director David Leitch’s <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/2477363/hobbs-and-shaw-review"><i>Fast &amp; Furious Presents: Hobbs &amp; Shaw</i></a> released in theaters, representing the first (and <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2465681/the-female-led-fast-and-furious-spinoff-is-really-happening">probably not the last</a>) spinoff in this street racing turned globetrotting action hero franchise. Next up though, we get back to the main crew for <i>Fast and Furious 9</i>, but the question remains, how connected will this universe be?</p>
      <p>Specifically, will <i>Hobbs &amp; Shaw</i> and the events of that film tie in to what happens in Justin Lin’s <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1708819/fast-and-furious-9-what-we-know-so-far"><i>Fast &amp; Furious 9</i></a>? Here’s what the spinoff's director David Leitch says:</p>
      <blockquote>There's definitely opportunities for them, but that's really a studio question. I tried my best to make this a real fertile world outside of <i>Fast</i>... The world's their oyster so I hope they take part in the fertile ground and explore it.</blockquote>
      <p>It seems that David Leitch doesn’t have much more insight on the potential connections between <i>Hobbs &amp; Shaw</i> and <i>Fast &amp; Furious 9</i> than we do, and if he does, he isn’t letting on. That doesn’t mean there won’t be any though, and such a thing could be very much in Universal Pictures’ plans. And there are plenty of opportunities on that front should the studio choose to pursue them.</p>
      <p>The director of <i>Deadpool 2</i> and <i>Hobbs &amp; Shaw</i> believes that there are some real opportunities for Universal to integrate the two parts of this growing franchise. As he told <a href="https://comicbook.com/movies/2019/11/14/david-leitch-discusses-hobbs-shaw-deadpool-3-and-how-good-brad-p/">Comicbook.com</a>, David Leitch tried his best in <i>Hobbs &amp; Shaw</i> to create a world that could stand on its own and has plenty of storytelling opportunities within it.</p>
      <p>While that world can theoretically operate independently as it did in the first film, the director would be happy to see the studio explore the mythology and world he created in <i>Fast &amp; Furious 9</i> and beyond. As he said, it’s Universal’s choice, but there is plenty of fertile ground in <i>Hobbs &amp; Shaw</i> for <i>Fast &amp; Furious 9</i> to dig in to, thereby weaving the two arms of this cinematic franchise closer together.</p>
      <p>Jason Statham and Dwayne Johnson are <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2466016/why-dwayne-johnson-probably-wont-be-back-for-fast-and-furious-9">not set to be in</a> <i>Fast &amp; Furious 9</i>, so if the latter film is going to tie in to <i>Hobbs &amp; Shaw</i>, it will have to be through some sort of plot detail. Although maybe we could find out in a post-credits scene for <i>Fast &amp; Furious 9</i> that Idris Elba’s Brixton is still alive, because come on, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2477470/hobbs-and-shaw-ending-what-happens-and-what-could-happen-next">he totally is</a>.</p>
      <p>I think it's more likely that either <i>Fast &amp; Furious 9</i> or <i>Fast &amp; Furious 10</i> will integrate the storyline about Eteon, the terrorist organization Brixton works for, whose <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2477719/hobbs-and-shaw-who-is-the-fast-and-furious-spinoffs-big-bad">mysterious leader</a> remains unseen. I imagine that will definitely be explored in a <i>Hobbs &amp; Shaw</i> sequel (which hasn’t been announced yet but seems inevitable), and it would be cool for <i>Fast &amp; Furious 10</i> to bring everyone together to defeat this great threat.</p>
      <p>It seemed like the two arms of this franchise might be forever split, a product of the acrimony between some of its stars, specifically Vin Diesel and <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2477798/a-history-of-the-beef-between-fast-and-furious-dwayne-johnson-and-tyrese-gibson">Tyrese Gibson and Dwayne Johnson</a>. But recently, signs have indicated <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481214/feud-finished-the-rock-hints-to-fast-and-furious-return-in-vin-diesel-thank-you-post">that feud may be over</a>, increasing the chances that we’ll see The Rock return in <i>Fast &amp; Furious 10</i>, or perhaps a cameo in the next film.</p>
      <p><i>Fast &amp; Furious 9</i> speeds into theaters on May 22, 2020. Check out our <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2480313/new-movie-releases-2020-movie-release-date-schedule">2020 Release Schedule</a> to see when all of next year’s biggest movies come out.</p>
