      <h1>Ruth Bader Ginsburg returns to Supreme Court after brief illness</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T19:15:51+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 19:15</time> by <a rel="author">Zachary Halaschak</a></address>
      <p>Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was back to work after <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/courts/indisposed-due-to-illness-ruth-bader-ginsburg-absent-from-supreme-court">missing a day of oral arguments</a> because of stomach flu.</p>
      <p>Ginsburg, 86, was in court on Friday to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/15/politics/ruth-bader-ginsburg-returns-supreme-court/index.html">participate</a> in an end-of-the-week closed-conference meeting, during which the justices are expected to take an initial vote on <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/courts/conservative-supreme-court-justices-seem-ready-to-allow-trump-to-end-daca">a key case</a> pertaining to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.</p>
      <p>She missed a day of oral arguments Wednesday because she was “indisposed due to an illness,” according to Chief Justice John Roberts. However, he said she intended to participate in considering the cases heard while she was out as she was able to read the briefs and transcripts.</p>
      <p>Wednesday marked the first time she missed oral arguments since her <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/courts/supreme-court-justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg-undergoes-surgery-to-treat-lung-cancer">recovery from a surgery</a> that removed two cancerous nodes from her left lung last year. She also successfully <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/supreme-court-justice-ginsburg-has-treatment-for-cancerous-tumor">completed radiation treatment</a> for pancreatic cancer in August.</p>
      <p>Named to the Supreme Court in 1993 by former President Bill Clinton, Ginsburg has <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ruth-bader-ginsburg-hopes-to-serve-on-supreme-court-for-at-least-five-more-years">vowed to remain</a> on until she is at least 90.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, in his <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/kavanaugh-greeted-with-standing-ovations-during-first-public-speech-since-confirmation">first public speech since being confirmed</a>, Justice Brett Kavanaugh told the conservative Federalist Society that the liberal Ginsburg is an “inspiration.”</p>
