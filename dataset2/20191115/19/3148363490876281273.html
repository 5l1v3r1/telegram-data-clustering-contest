      <p>On Friday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s special coverage of the House Intelligence Committees public so-called impeachment inquiry hearings, former independent counsel Ken Starr said President Donald Trump showed “extraordinarily poor judgment” in his tweet about former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch during her testimony.</p>

      <p>Starr said, “Well, I must say that the president was not advised by counsel in deciding to do this tweet — extraordinarily poor judgment. The president frequently says, ‘I follow my instincts.’ Sometimes we have to control our instincts. So, obviously, this was I think quite injurious.”</p>
      <p>He added, “I don’t think it rises to the level of intimidation of a witness, but I think that’s the way it’s going to be characterized.”</p>
