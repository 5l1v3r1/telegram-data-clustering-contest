      <p>I interviewed the delightful John Hodgman about some of his favorite tools, and I learned many good tips from him (especially how to reverse sear a steak). As you probably know, John is a writer, performer, former PC, once the resident expert on the <i>Daily Show</i>, and now the author of two books of non-fake facts and true stories from his life, <a href="https://amzn.to/2Kmka5n">Vacationland</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/33Nooe7">Medallion Status</a>. You can find him at Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/hodgman">@hodgman</a> and on Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/johnhodgman/">@johnhodgman</a>.</p>
      <p>Here are the <a href="https://kk.org/cooltools/john-hodgman-author-of-medallion-status/">links to the tools</a> he talks about.</p>
