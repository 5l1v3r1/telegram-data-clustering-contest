      <h3>Xbox One S vs Xbox One X: Which console should I pick?</h3>
      <p>There's quite an easy way to answer this question. Do you have a 4K TV or are you planning to buy one soon? If the answer is no, a big major selling point of the Xbox One X is eliminated. It is meant for 4K gaming and media consumption, and if you're not ready to invest in a 4K TV, you should skip the Xbox One X this year and opt for one of the Xbox One S models instead.</p>
      <p>There are a few advantages to having a Xbox One X past its 4K capabilities, such as improved loading times, but it's hard to argue that they're worth hundreds of dollars more. You can learn more about the differences between the two in <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/xbox-one-s-vs-xbox-one-x">our breakdown</a>.</p>
      <h3>What about the All-Digital Console?</h3>
      <p>The Xbox One S All-Digital Console is one of our favorites because it's the most affordable model yet! Coming in at $50 below the standard Xbox One S, the All-Digital console doesn't use any video game discs at all. It is solely built for playing digital game downloads, which has its pros and cons. For one, no more buying pre-owned games or selling the games you no longer want. Digital game downloads are also a bit harder to find on sale compared to physical games, though they do eventually drop in price.</p>
      <p>This model is certainly a bit more refined than Xbox consoles of the past, though its affordable entry-point shouldn't trick you into thinking gaming with it will be affordable as well. It might be a better idea to choose one of the models that lets you use physical discs if you purchase pre-owned games often or aren't interested in digital gaming.</p>
      <h3>Will my current games work on a new console?</h3>
      <p>All Xbox One video games will work on the original Xbox One, the Xbox One S, and the Xbox One X. There are a huge number of older Xbox and Xbox 360 games that will work with these consoles too (we have an <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/xbox-one-backward-compatibility-list">entire list of backwards compatible games</a>).</p>
      <p>If you're buying the Xbox One S All-Digital Edition, you obviously won't be able to use any of your game discs with your new console. However, any digital Xbox One games you purchased previously will be playable on the Xbox One S All-Digital Edition. To play older games, you can grab a subscription to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Membership-Digital/dp/B07K782P3N?mnsid=mbnx33-20&amp;tag=mbnx33-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU71776YYm">Xbox Game Pass</a> which lets you play over 100 Xbox One and Xbox 360 games digitally with your membership.</p>
      <h3>What is Xbox Game Pass? Do you need Xbox Live?</h3>
      <p>Xbox Game Pass is like what Netflix is for movies and TV, but for Xbox games. You can play over 100 Xbox One and Xbox 360 games with your membership, and it's only $10 a month! You don't need an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Live-Gold-Membership-Digital/dp/B002VBWIP6?mnsid=mbnx33-20&amp;tag=mbnx33-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU71776YYm">Xbox Live Gold membership</a> to use Game Pass either, though you can bundle them together and save $5 a month in the process by choosing an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TGNFVWV?mnsid=mbnx33-20&amp;tag=mbnx33-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU71776YYm">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a> subscription.</p>
      <p>Game Pass is an awesome service for gamers that will keep you playing non-stop without ever having to buy another game at full price. It's pretty much essential for Xbox One S All-Digital Edition owners and a great way to keep the costs of gaming low.</p>
      <h3>Will Xbox accessories be on sale?</h3>
      <p>Of course! Black Friday isn't just a time to make big purchases. You can save on the smaller essentials, too. Accessories like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Black-one/dp/B01LPZM7VI?tag=wpcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU71776YYm">Xbox Wireless Controller</a> will be on sale, along with gaming headsets, external hard drives, and more. We might even see a discount hit Xbox Game Pass and Xbox Live Gold, if past Black Friday sales are anything to go by.</p>
