      <h1>What Are You Playing This Weekend?</h1>

      <p>The weekend is for doing A Very Serious Housecleaning and plugging a bunch of cracks in my flat, because the cold weather seems to be driving roaches inside, and I am a massive bug baby. It’s also for playing video games while I try not to think about roaches.</p>
      <p>I have been playing a tonne of <i>Holedown</i> on Switch this week, which is a game where you fire balls at numbered blocks to try to get to the bottom of a level. Stephen Totilo wrote about playing the game on mobile last year and pondered what it takes to get good at it. I am not good at it, but I desperately want to be, which means I keep playing a round, putting my Switch down, and then immediately grabbing it up again and playing another round, thinking “OK, I have it <i>this</i> time.” It’s a pretty good game!</p>
      <p>What about you? What are you playing?</p>
