      <h1>iFixit Tears Down the New 16-inch MacBook Pro Keyboard</h1>

      <p>iFixit has posted its teardown of the new 16-inch MacBook Pro keyboard.<br/><br/><i>Your long butterfly keyboard nightmare is over. The new Magic Keyboard in the 16-inch MacBook Pro uses switches that look and feel almost identical to much older Apple devicesâ€”so close, in fact, that you can stick desktop Magic Keyboard keycaps onto these switches. It feels like a do-over, a throwback, almost an apology.</i><br/><br/>The keys features deeper travel, softer sound, and a more robust design. Unfortunately, replacing a switch mechanism still involves disassembling the whole device, but it's possible.<br/><br/>Compared to the butterfly keyboard, there's about 0.5mm more travel when pressing a key. The keycaps themselves are about 0.2mm thicker and the tiny clips that attach keycaps to scissor switches appear to be reinforced. This means it will be easier to remove and replace keycaps without breaking anything.<br/><br/>Hit the link below to learn more about the new keyboard. iFixit will post the full 16-inch MacBook Pro teardown on Monday.<br/><br/>If you're interested in purchasing the new 16-inch MacBook Pro, Amazon is offering <a href="https://amzn.to/2KpK8F7">$100 off</a> today.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/16-inch-macbook-pro-magic-keyboard-throwback">Read More</a></p>
