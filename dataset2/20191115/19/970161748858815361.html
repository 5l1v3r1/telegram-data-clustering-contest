      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/bradley-walsh/">Bradley Walsh</a> has warned fans to expect ‘terrifying’ new monsters when <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/doctor-who/">Doctor Who</a> returns for its 12th series next year.</p>
      <p>The Chase anchor plays the loveable Graham in the long-running sci-fi show, and is one of three current companions in Jodie <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jodie-whittaker/">Whittaker</a>’s TARDIS.</p>
      <p>And, discussing what we can expect from the next instalment, Walsh said the baddies featured in the next run of the serial will be some of the scariest fans have seen.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve got to say, be prepared for the monsters,’ he said. ‘There are some monsters that will absolutely make your hair curl.</p>
      <p>‘There’s a couple of monsters they’ve come up with that are absolutely terrifying,’ <a href="https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2019-11-15/doctor-who-series-12-monsters/">he added to Radio Times</a>. ‘Absolutely terrifying.’</p>
      <p>Considering the legacy the show has for creating scary delights – from the Daleks to the Weeping Angels – we’ll take that as fair warning and are already preparing ourselves for the nightmares.</p>

      <p>Jodie Whittaker’s second series as the Twelfth Doctor will hit screens early next year, following the rapturous reception for her first stint in the TARDIS last year.</p>

      <p>A former star of the show has also claimed that the next series could be the best yet, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/06/doctor-whos-jodie-whittaker-will-be-better-than-ever-in-her-second-series-just-like-david-tennant-and-matt-smith-before-her-11048976/">and that Whittaker herself will be ‘better than ever’</a> in her second run, just like David Tennant and Matt Smith before her.</p>
      <p>Arthur Darvill, who played Rory Williams during The Crown star Smith’s tenure as the Time Lord, said this will be the series where the Broadchurch star can have some fun.</p>
      <p>‘I think Jodie is amazing,’ he said. ‘I’m really looking forward to what they do next year. I always think the second series of anyone in that role is the one where they bloom.</p>
      <p>‘You’ve had the year of “Will they like it? won’t they like it?” and then the second year is great. We saw that with David [Tennant], Matt [Smith] and Peter [Capaldi], the second series is the one where they have fun.’</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/10/doctor-teases-something-big-just-two-weeks-time-11074797/">The show itself is also teasing some big news</a> that will be coming fan’s way in the next few days.</p>

      <p>We’ve been told to keep our diaries open for November 23 – which is now less than two weeks away.</p>
      <p>The much-loved sci-fi series has been missing from our screens since New Year’s Day this year, with warnings that it wouldn’t return until early 2020. So…what’s this date for?</p>
      <p>Will it be a surprise special, a simple trailer tease, or even the start of a new series?</p>
