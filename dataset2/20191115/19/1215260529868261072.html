        <b>Mining Minister, Robert Montague, says the Ministry has granted some 90 exploratory licences for semiprecious minerals such as cobalt, copper, gold, silver and zinc, since March 2018.</b>
      </p>
      <p>“Right now, almost every square inch of Jamaica is under a prospecting licence for some kind of mineral. The beauty of it, is that most of the companies that are prospecting… are Jamaican-owned. So if [for example] gold is found… in commercial quantities, the profits will stay here,” he said.</p>
      <p>He assured, however, that the Government is encouraging and facilitating the exploitation of minerals “in a very sustainable and structured way”.</p>
      <p>He was speaking at a Corporate Governance Seminar at the Terra Nova All-Suite Hotel in St Andrew on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Montague said that in a bid to encourage the mining of semiprecious minerals, the Ministry’s Mines and Geology Division hosted a series of workshops and training seminars for industry stakeholders.   </p>
      <p>These, he indicated, formed part of the three-year €13.1-million African, Caribbean and Pacific-European Union (ACP-EU) Development Minerals Programme.</p>
      <p>This capacity-building initiative, conceptualised by the ACP Group of States, aims to enhance the profile and improve the management of development minerals.</p>
      <p>These include industrial minerals, construction materials, and dimension and semiprecious stones.</p>
      <p>Montague noted that the programme has benefited local jewellery makers who are now utilising semiprecious stones, “which is a huge market”.</p>
