      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/cristiano-ronaldo/">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> has given his stamp of approval to Juventus’ move for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/paul-pogba/">Paul Pogba</a>, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Pogba has been heavily linked with a move back to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/juventus/">Juventus</a> and is reportedly keen to leave <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> next summer.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/27/paul-pogba-aiming-leave-manchester-united-january-transfer-window-10816837/">midfielder failed in a bid to force his way out of United during the summer</a> amid interest from Juventus and Spanish giants Real Madrid.</p>
      <p><a href="https://eldesmarque.com/madrid/real-madrid/noticias/176093-operacion-pogba-80-millones-y-tu-el-plan-bomba-de-zidane-en-el-real-madrid-ed">El Desmarque</a> claim Juventus are exploring the possibility of re-signing Pogba, who left the club for United in an £89million move in 2016.</p>

      <p>Pogba has struggled to live up to that huge price tag at United and said during the summer <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/11/paul-pogba-speaks-future-manchester-uniteds-win-chelsea-10554682/">he wanted a new challenge</a>.</p>
      <p>Juventus have checked in with their star man Ronaldo about moving for Pogba and the Portugal international is happy for the club to sign the Frenchman.</p>

      <p>Pogba is currently sidelined through injury and has played just five times for United this season due to ongoing ankle problems.</p>
      <p>Juventus will surely <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/10/zinedine-zidane-confident-real-madrid-will-sign-paul-pogba-manchester-united-10894775/">face competition from Real</a> if they firm up their interest in Pogba.</p>
      <p>Zinedine Zidane is a big fan of Pogba and is the driving force behind Real’s interest in him.</p>
      <p>United were <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/10/manchester-united-stick-179million-asking-price-paul-pogba-complete-january-transfer-10718605/">demanding £179million for Pogba during the summer</a> and intend to stick to that asking price if clubs come calling again in January.</p>
