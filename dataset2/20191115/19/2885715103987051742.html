      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T19:26:11+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 19:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/express-news-service/" target="_blank">Express News Service</a></address>
      <p>One-touch solutions to get rid of household scrap, updates on Metro train delays and checking indoor air quality — these are among the apps developed by students of Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi (IIIT-D) and on display at ‘Building Better Interfaces’ exhibition on the campus Friday.</p>
      <p>Among the apps featured at the one-day exhibition was ‘Swapeco’, which promises to send a scrap collector to the doorstep with just a click. “There are issues with kabadiwallas. You may not find one according to your time, or sometime they use faulty weighing scales…Once a person downloads the app and schedules a pick-up time, either we go personally, or identify kabadiwallas and get them to work with us,” said Mukul Chhabra, a student of Electronics &amp; Communication Engineering, one of the developers of the app.</p>
      <p>The app has been functional since February, and the service is currently functional only in South Delhi.</p>
      <p>Another app, DMRC Connect, provides information of delays in Metro services and acts as a platform for commuters to submit their grievances. However, the app has not been rolled out.</p>
      <p>Abhijeet Mishra of Computer Science and Designing has made PAQsys, a device which monitors indoor air pollution: “The device shows the amount of volatile organic compounds…users can get all details on the app.”</p>
