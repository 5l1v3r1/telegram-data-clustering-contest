      <h1>Hull Mum takes own life, despite getting all clear from breast cancer</h1>
      <h2>48-year-old Alison Douglas was described as "kind, funny and popular", couldn't bear the thought of her breast cancer returning</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T19:37:27+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 19:37</time> by <a rel="author">Anna Riley, Sarah McGee</a></address>
      <p>A Mum from Hull took her own life, unable to believe that her breast cancer had really gone for good. <br/><br/>Alison Douglas was given the all clear and told she had a 70% chance of remaining cancer-free for the next ten years. Despite this, she was unable to accept that she was really cancer free and committed suicide in her home. <br/><br/>According to the <a href="https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/news/hull-east-yorkshire-news/alison-douglas-cancer-ends-life-3525861">Hull Daily Mail</a> , this comes after a ten month struggle with anxiety and depression after her diagnosis in June 2018.</p>

      <p>In court, Alison's husband talked about his wife's nature, calling her a "very kind, funny person," who was popular with others.</p>
      <p>He said: "She worked at Humdinger (food and drink establishment) and loved her work and used to run a lot of charity events and events for mothers". <br/><br/>Mr Douglas also talked about his wife's youth, saying: "When she was 17, she met me when we both worked at Masterprint and we married and moved into together in August 1993 and enjoyed holidays and long weekends together.</p>
      <p>"Alison was born to parents unknown and was adopted as a baby. She was born with an underdeveloped kidney and had water infections and problems with her kidney throughout her life.</p>
      <p>"She was always smiling and had a happy childhood and had lots of friends.</p>
      <p>"She was mad on animals but was restrained by her allergies as to the pets she could have. She was a big lover of giraffes and adopted a giraffe from Chester Zoo for our son."</p>
      <h3>Alison's history with mental health</h3>
      <p>Alison didn't cope well with her diagnosis and received help from Miranda House. An inquest found that she had also tried to end her life on two previous occasions and had history with self-harm. <br/><br/>She told staff that giving up work after her diagnosis made her feel "worthless and a waste of space" and she easily became "overwhelmed by simple tasks". <br/><br/>She had three operations to remove the tumour , which made knocked her confidence and really made her worry about the future; she suffered many sleepless nights where she would worry. <br/><br/>At one point, Mrs Douglas said her anxiety got so bad that she couldn't leave the house, telling professionals her mental health was so bad it felt like she was having "acid thrown on her body".</p>
      <h3>Was enough done to help Alison?</h3>

      <p>A report commissioned by Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust found that health professionals had done everything in their power to help Alison.</p>
      <p>Senior coroner, Professor Paul Marks, determined that Mrs Douglas had ended her own life. <br/><br/>He described the circumstances as "tragic and ironic", considering she was clear of cancer with a hopeful future prognisis.</p>
      <p>The coroner continued: "This is a most unfortunate case and I have considered the conclusion very carefully,</p>
      <p>"The key point in finding a conclusion of suicide is showing intent and that the deceased knew that their actions would result in the ending of their life, so I find a conclusion of suicide". <br/><br/>If you need help, or are struggling with your mental health, the NHS have many <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/mental-health-helplines/">helplines for you to refer to</a> on their website.</p>
