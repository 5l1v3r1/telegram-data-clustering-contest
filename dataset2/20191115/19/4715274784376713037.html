      <p>The Lourdes Montinola Piña Weaving competition aims to showcase traditional weaving. The recently held 2019 edition continued the original intention of the event—revitalizing traditional piña cloth production and welcoming fresh ideas from young talents. </p>
      <p>This year’s winning entry was made by Raquel Elserio. Her inventive piña-silk shawl enhances the smoothness of the fabric by juxtaposing it with clever knotting of the individual fibers.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, senior students took the reins of this year’s Hibla fashion show, whose theme “Pamana Para sa Kinabukasan” sought to promote culture and heritage preservation. </p>
      <p>The event had five categories: casual wear, semi-formal, formal, couture, and accessories and jewelry. Student groups in each category were tasked to collaborate on reinventing fabrics of the different regions in the country.</p>
      <p>The winners took their inspiration from the versatility of Mindanao fabrics such as the Maguindanao textile and T’nalak-inspired accessory pieces. Others were inspired by the symbolic diversity of Iloilo’s Hablon fabric.</p>
