      <p>Santé, a provider of premier organic health and wellness products and services, just offered an early Christmas gift for anyone who has a sweet tooth. They recently launched a new product named SweetVia, a Stevia and Inulin Sweetener, at the Blue Leaf Cosmopolitan, Quezon City. It’s a sweetener that’s free from artificial additives! There’s no more guilt when it comes to satisfying your cravings. SweetVia is made of Stevia, a natural substitute for sugar that is extracted from the leaves of a small perennial green shrub which according to studies, has medicinal properties that are anti-diarrheal, anti-tumor, diuretic, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory actions. It is best for reducing high blood sugar levels and high blood pressure. Even actress and singer Denise Laurel is thankful for the new sweetener. At the SweetVia launch event, Laurel shared how it’s a struggle for her as a celebrity to lose some weight, let alone maintain her figure.</p>

      <p>It’s a good thing that SweetVia is ideal for weight management. It does not increase her sugar levels, making it a sweet exchange for Laurel’s usual sweeteners. That’s not all! This herbal sweetener also contains Inulin—a known prebiotic that stimulates the growth of good bacteria in the tummy. Studies show that it relieves constipation, promotes weight loss, and helps control blood sugar levels. It also helps improve the absorption of nutrients in the body. “We know that it is hard to stay healthy these days, especially with the influx of sweeteners everywhere. Made from natural ingredients, Santé’s SweetVia does not only sweeten your beverage as it also provides benefits to your health. Now you can treat yourself without the guilt,” said Minette Carag, Chief Product Officer of Santé. Nikka Garcia, the wife of Patrick Garcia and a mother of three, can’t go a day without a cup of coffee. For her, SweetVia makes the perfect partner to kickstart great change in her overall health. Coupled by good eating habits and ample exercise, she knows that switching her usual sugar to SweetVia will yield amazing and consistent results. <i>Treat without the guilt.</i> Vloggers Benedict Cua, Deegee Razon, Kimpoy Feliciano, and Hashtag Ryle Santiago indulged on a Banana Strawberry Smoothie, Mango Smoothie and Peanut Butter Mug Cake made by Chef Rosebud Benitez using only SweetVia as their sweetener.</p>
