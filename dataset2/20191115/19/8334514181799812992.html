      <p>The Norwegian, Frode Berg, a retired border guard, was arrested in Moscow in 2017 and convicted of gathering intelligence on behalf of Norway. He pleaded not guilty.</p>
      <p>Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg told a news conference she had spoken with Berg by telephone and he would come home as soon as “practically possible”.</p>
      <p>“We are happy that Frode Berg is coming back home to Norway as a free man,” she added.</p>
      <p>Berg’s lawyer, Brynjulf Risnes, told Norwegian newspaper VG that Berg was undergoing a medical examination, and needed some peace before traveling back to Norway.</p>
      <p>It was not immediately clear when Berg could fly back from Lithuania, which helped to arrange the spy swap that took place at midday on Friday at a Lithuanian border post with Russia’s Kaliningrad exclave.</p>
      <p>Solberg told a news conference that the actions of Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda and his country’s parliament showed “a spirit of a great ally and true friend, and we will remain grateful”.</p>
      <p>Norway has not promised any rewards to Lithuania in exchange, she added.</p>
      <p>Both Norway and Lithuania are NATO member states, and Norway has its soldiers taking part in NATO’s rotating exercises in the Baltic state, concerned about Russia’s aggressiveness.</p>
      <p>Moscow says it has no intention of invading the Baltics or Poland and accuses NATO of destabilizing Europe by moving troops closer to Russia’s borders.</p>
      <p>News about Berg’s release prompted celebrations in his hometown Kirkenes, in Arctic Norway.</p>
      <p>“We have been waiting for this for two years now,” Oeystein Hansen, a member of a support group, told Reuters by phone. “It is very good for all the parties, the local community, the family, the Norwegian nation.”</p>
      <p>“We are so happy right now,” Berg’s daughter, Christina Berg, who was waiting for her father’s return in Oslo, told Reuters by text message.</p>
      <h3>RUSSIAN SPIES</h3>
      <p>One of the two freed Russians, Nikolai Filipchenko, was sentenced in Lithuania in 2017 to 10 years in jail for spying.</p>
      <p>Lithuanian media reported that Filipchenko held the rank of lieutenant colonel in Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) and tried to recruit the Lithuanian president’s bodyguards to bug the president’s office.</p>
      <p>Another freed Russian, Sergej Moisejenko, was sentenced in 2017 to 10-1/2 years for spying and illegal possession of weapons, the prosecutor’s office said.</p>
      <p>According to Lithuanian media reports, he tried to gather information about Lithuanian armed forces and NATO’s air police mission in Lithuania.</p>
