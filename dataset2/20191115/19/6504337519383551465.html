      <p>After deliberating for 12 days, jurors acquitted a Hillsborough real estate heiress accused of murdering the father of her children in 2016.</p>
      <p>Tiffany Li had been charged with conspiring with her boyfriend Kaveh Bayat to kill 27-year-old Keith Green over a custody dispute.</p>
      <p>The case drew national attention when Li's family, known for their successful real estate construction business in China, posted $35 million in bail for her. Prosecutors had set the bail high because they determined that Li was a flight risk. Li is a naturalized U.S. citizen but was born in China. At the time, San Mateo County District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe told a judge her family's wealth was estimated to be in the "$100 million to $150 million range."</p>
      <p>Green's body was found along a dirt road in Greenbrae nearly two weeks after he was last seen meeting with Li to discuss custody of their children.</p>

      <p>San Mateo County prosecutors said Li lured Green to her mansion in Hillsborough, south of San Francisco. They say Bayat shot Green in the mouth and the two hired a friend, Olivier Adella, to dispose of the body. Prosecutors presented evidence that Green’s blood was found in Li’s Mercedes and gunshot residue was discovered in her garage.</p>
      <p>Li’s attorneys argued that Green was killed in a botched kidnapping plot and that she had nothing to do with his death. She had settled the custody issues with her former boyfriend, they said.</p>
      <p>Jurors cleared Bayat of gun charges Friday but were deadlocked on his role in the murder.</p>
      <p>A mistrial has now been declared in Bayat’s case.</p>
      <p>Charges are pending against Adella, who is accused of dumping the body. He was originally offered a plea agreement in exchange for his testimony in the murder trial, but it was revoked after it was discovered that he had contacted a witness for the defense.</p>
