      <p><b>TORONTO (AP)</b> - A woman accused of throwing a chair off a 45th story balcony from a downtown Toronto high-rise has pleaded guilty to mischief causing danger to life.</p>
      <p>Nineteen-year-old Marcella Zoia made the plea Friday in a packed Toronto courtroom. Zoia acknowledged she was the woman seen in a video that sparked widespread outrage last February.</p>
      <p>A sentencing hearing has been scheduled for Jan. 14.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors say they will seek a six-month prison sentence in the case.</p>
      <p>Zoia's lawyer, Greg Leslie, says he'll seek a suspended sentence, saying six months in prison is too harsh for a woman his client's age.</p>
      <p>Leslie says he expects two other charges against Zoia in the incident will be dropped.</p>
