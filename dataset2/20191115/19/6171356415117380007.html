      <h1>Get a refurbished Acer 2-in-1 Chromebook for $99 today only</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T19:13:46+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 19:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/corbin-davenport/" target="_blank">Corbin Davenport</a></address>
      <p>Chromebooks are the best bang-for-your-buck value when they're cheap. A $99 Windows laptop will only make you sad, but a $99 Chromebook can be a usable computer. Case in point: you can get a refurbished Acer 2-in-1 model for just $98.99 right now from Amazon-owned Woot.</p>
      <p>The hardware inside isn't amazing, but hey, did you expect high-end parts in a $100 laptop? You get a 4-core/4-thread <a href="https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/87258/intel-celeron-processor-n3150-2m-cache-up-to-2-08-ghz.html">Intel Celeron N3150</a> (with a base clock of 1.6GHz and a boost clock of 2.08GHz), 4GB of RAM, a 11.6-inch 1366 x 768 IPS screen, and 16GB of eMMC internal storage. That's enough for basic web browsing. <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/6220366?hl=en'">According to Google</a>, this model will receive Chrome OS updates until June 2022, and <a href="https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/chrome-os-systems-supporting-android-apps">Android apps are supported</a>.</p>

      <p>The only major catch is that it seems to charge using a barrel connector, instead of USB Type-C. In fact, there are no Type-C ports at all, only USB Type-A (one 2.0, one 3.0). There is a full-size HDMI connector though, which you don't see on many Chromebooks these days.</p>
      <p>You can buy the Chromebook with a 90-day warranty from the link below. Amazon Prime members get free shipping, and the sale ends today.</p>
