      <h1>Property tax hike among SDMC budget proposals</h1>

      <p>The South Delhi Municipal Corporation commissioner Gyanesh Bharti in a budget meeting Friday proposed an increase of one percent in property tax on residential properties in three categories of colonies. However, as per officials, the proposal may not see the light of day with the political wing of the body likely to quash it in view of elections.</p>
      <p>The South civic body has also proposed that a Waste-to- Energy plant be installed at Waste to Wonder park, 15,000 LED lights be put up at dark spots, and an engineered landfill site be constructed in Okhla.</p>
      <p>The focus of the budget, however, remained largely on sanitation, with the civic body announcing purchase of mechanical road sweepers for narrow lanes and extension of waste segregation to more wards. Currently, the waste segregation is being implemented in 40 wards.</p>
      <p>The commissioner also proposed 10 new automated multilevel parking at different places. The civic body, in its last year budget, had made a similar promise. Several parking projects pending for over a decade in areas like New Friends Colony and Bhogal are yet to be made completely operational.</p>
      <p>The corporation has once again pushed for completion of Poornima Sethi Hospital which presently functions as a poly clinic.</p>
      <p>Among other announcements, the corporation said a physiotherapy centre will be opened in East of Kailash and a health centre at Katwaria Sarai.</p>
      <p>It also proposed setting up a cremation centre in Dwarka Sector 29 for cremation of dogs.</p>
      <p>Provision for open gym in parks, financial assistance to RWAs under Public-Private partnership scheme, sprinkler irrigation systems in over 100 parks, installation of play apparatus in schools were among the other proposals made by the South body commissioner.</p>
