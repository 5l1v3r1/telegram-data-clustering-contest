      <p>Disney said in a statement it has seen “extraordinary consumer demand” and “has already reached a major milestone, achieving a remarkable 10 million sign-ups since launching.”</p>
      <p>The news comes despite a launch marred by glitches that prevented many customers accessing titles from <i>Mickey Mouse </i>cartoons to <i>Star Wars</i></p>
      <p>.</p>
      <p>Disney+ marks a huge bet by the media-entertainment giant, pitching it into direct conflict with on-demand services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime which have disrupted the Hollywood media landscape.</p>
      <p>It went live Tuesday across the US, Canada and Netherlands, featuring thousands of movies and TV episodes from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and National Geographic.</p>
      <p>Disney chief <b>Bob Iger </b></p>
      <p>called the launch “a historic moment for our company that marks a new era of innovation and creativity.” </p>
