      <h1>Brazil vs Argentina LIVE result: Lionel Messi goal enough to earn victory in Saudi Arabia</h1>
      <h2>Final score: <b>Brazil 0-1 Argentina</b></h2>

      <p>Lionel Messi's solitary first-half goal was enough for Argentina to get the better of their old foe Brazil in Saudi Arabia. </p>
      <p>Brazil had the first clear opportunity when Gabriel Jesus earned a penalty, but the Manchester City forward registered the fifth missed penalty of his young career, steering the ball wide of the post having sent the goalkeeper the wrong way. </p>
      <p>Messi earned a penalty of his own a few minutes later when Alex Sandro tripped him in the box, although the contact appeared minimal. Messi got up to take the kick himself and although Alisson Becker saved his initial shot, the Liverpool keeper couldn't hold on to the ball and it squirmed loose for Messi to tap home.</p>
      <p>Argentina were forced to dig deep at times in the second half although they also missed chances to wrap up the match. Re-live the game in Riyadh:</p>

Brazil's is undoubtedly elite, for me, with sufficient jauntiness to rouse any crowd.

        <h3>3 min: Brazil 0-0 Argentina</h3>
        <p>Esteban Andrada has started brightly, the Boca goalkeeper, spraying balls to Argentina's flanks like a midfielder.</p>

        <h3>6 min: Brazil 0-0 Argentina</h3>
        <p>Oof, almost an outrageous mistake by Andrada, who pretty much tackles his own defender and then is nearly tackled himself by Jesus, but he manages to win a goalkick from the situation when it could have gone badly wrong.</p>

        </p>
        <h3>7 min: Brazil 0-0 Argentina</h3>
        <p>Jesus follows up a few minutes later with a chance on the angle but it's tamely hit and easily collected by Andrada. </p>
