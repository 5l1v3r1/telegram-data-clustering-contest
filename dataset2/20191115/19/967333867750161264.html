      <p>An adorable otter has been filmed lying on its back and scratching its tummy with both paws. Apparently, the act of belly-rubbing makes the mustelid really drowsy, as it is seen yawning drowsily.</p>
      <p>Netizens wholeheartedly admired the cute little critter, with many saying that this is what they must look like after dinner.</p>
