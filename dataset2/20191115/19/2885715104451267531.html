      <p>Observing that women in Mumbai still feel unsafe while travelling in local trains, the Bombay High Court on Friday said that since 2013, several orders have been passed and heaps of affidavits filed, but the reaction of authorities on the issue has been “knee-jerk”.</p>
      <p>“See the plight of the citizens of Mumbai. The perception is that nobody is doing anything. This is very disappointing. This is how the commercial capital of the country is perceived,” Justice S C Dharmadhikari said.</p>
      <p>A division bench of Justices Dharmadhikari and R I Chagla was hearing a PIL filed in 2012 on the issue of safety of women in trains and vacancies in the Railway Protection Force (RPF). The PIL was filed by Help Mumbai Foundation after a woman was attacked and molested in a local train at Juinagar in 2011.</p>
      <p>Making a reference to media reports about ‘Fatka gangs’ operating in local trains, the court said railway authorities need to crack down on those harassing women passengers. “If Fatka gangs can enter trains, so can drug peddlers and criminals… Drunkards, jobless youth can chase after women at all times. They can do anything… How many such cases are reported every day?” the court asked.</p>
      <p>“Ask women how protected they feel in trains. Women from all strata of society take trains, day in and out. Educated women are at least aware enough to fight and get cases lodged, but what about those who do not know how to handle such situations?” Justice Dharmadhikari observed.</p>
      <p>The court asked the counsel for railways if they had carried out any survey by reaching out to women travellers and asking them what they face each day while travelling in local trains.</p>
      <p>When Western Railway lawyer Suresh Kumar pointed out that RPF constables travel in the ladies’ coaches during late night and early morning hours, the court said that it was a “wonderful perception” that criminals had given the RPF prior intimation of committing crimes only during these hours. “How do you monitor if these RPF constables travel in the compartment from start to end?” the court asked. The bench added that no RPF official should be allowed to use their mobile phones while on duty.</p>
      <p>The court directed both the central and western railway authorities to file a comprehensive action taken report on the issue by December 12.</p>
