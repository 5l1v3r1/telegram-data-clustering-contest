      <p>Among the high-profile talent making appearances, meeting and greeting fans, are William Shatner (“Star Trek”) Lou Ferrigno  (“The Incredible Hulk”) Adrian Grenier (“Entourage”) Cary Elwes (“The Princess Bride”) Emma Bell (“The Walking Dead”) Dorian Gregory (“Charmed”) Mads Mikkelsen (“Dr. Strange,”) and Steven Seagal (“Under Siege” “Above The Law”) among many others.</p>
      <p>Mr. Bundlie comments, “We are thrilled to be one of the first entertainment ventures welcomed after Saudi’s recent announcement that, for the first time ever, it would  open its doors to international tourists.  It is exciting to be a part of this unprecedented initiative to introduce tourism from other countries to the beauty, charm and culture of Saudi Arabia. The merge of the great makers of entertainment represented in Stan Lee’s Super Con and the opening up of Saudi’s doors creates an innovative way to combine entertainment and culture from the west to the east and vice versa.”</p>
