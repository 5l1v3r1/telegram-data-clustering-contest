      <h1>Hexo Stock May Be Fast Approaching Its Blood-on-the-Streets Moment</h1>
      <h2>Avoid HEXO stock until it finds a bottom</h2>

      <p>Amid a cash crunch, <b>Hexo </b>(NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/hexo-stock-quote/"><b><u>HEXO</u></b></a>) stock continues its sell-off. The Gatineau, Quebec-based marijuana producer has seen its cash dwindle as investors have turned on the sector amid oversupply and vaping-related issues. As a result, a company that once came close to becoming profitable now looks more like a sinking ship. Unless and until Hexo stock can improve its cash situation and establish a bottom, investors should stay away.</p>

      <p>I’m forced to offer a mea culpa on Hexo stock. I had considered HEXO one of my favorites of the non-top-tier marijuana stocks.</p>
      <p>After all, they have a strong base in their home province of Quebec, which constitutes about 21% of Canada’s population. Also, they established an alliance with <b>Molson Coors </b>(NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/tap-stock-quote/"><b><u>TAP</u></b></a>) to produce cannabis-infused beverages following their recent legalization in Canada. On top of that, they had been on track to turn a profit.</p>
      <p>The latest earnings report changed that. HEXO plummeted by 23% in one day as the company dramatically lowered fourth-quarter guidance and withdrew guidance completely for fiscal 2020.</p>
      <p>The actual earnings release for the fourth quarter later in the month led to a further decline. The stock price has now fallen by more than 46% in a little more than a month.</p>
      <p>Outside of the company, the vaping crisis has contributed to its problems. Though the latest evidence points to black-market vape pens, the entire industry has suffered.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the Canadian market faces a massive oversupply. Thanks in part to high taxes and tight regulation, many consumers continue to turn to the black market. As <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/10/5-reasons-why-i-still-believe-in-hexo-stock/">Josh Enomoto mentioned</a>, illegal weed makes up <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/19/10/14640295/canada-enters-cannabis-2-0-2019-cannabis-industry-outlook">about 60% of the market</a>. Now, the company ceased production at one facility and took 200,000 sq. ft. offline at its main facility in Gatineau, Quebec.</p>
      <h3>HEXO Low on Cash</h3>
      <p>Top executives have left the company, including the CFO, who left soon before Hexo issued guidance. The timing for this is not fortuitous as the company faces a cash crunch. It currently holds about CAD$139.51 million in cash. Since it lost CAD$81.56 million in the last quarter, the company needs to find funding quickly.</p>
      <p>As <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/11/hexo-stock-has-a-cash-problem/">Wayne Duggan pointed out</a>, the CAD$70 million it raised through a 7% dilution will not get it through a quarter as its current burn rate. The CAD$30.26 million in long-term debt is not high, considering its CAD$776.76 million in equity.</p>
      <p>Still, without a dramatic cut in losses, that option appears limited as well. Further, the deal with Molson Coors is not the kind of investment that <b>Constellation </b>(NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/stz-stock-quote/"><b><u>STZ</u></b></a>) has made in <b>Canopy Growth </b>(NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/cgc-stock-quote/"><b><u>CGC</u></b></a>). Hence, Hexo is not equipped to weather this crisis as well as Canopy or other top-tier weed stocks.</p>
      <p>Have I given up all hope? Not yet. However, it appears to have entered a “blood in the streets” moment. The question has become whether Warren Buffett-like investors will buy into this crisis. I think maybe, but not yet. Hexo stock trades near its 52-week low. Only rarely are such points a good time to buy. Unless it finds a floor somewhere above $0 per share, investors probably should watch HEXO instead of buy.</p>
      <h3>The Bottom Line on Hexo Stock</h3>
      <p>Unless and until the HEXO finds a floor, investors need to stay on the sidelines. The outlook for Hexo stock has turned dramatically negative over the last few months. Hexo look poised to become profitable a few months ago. Its substantial market share in Quebec and deal with Molson Coors appeared to point to a bright future.</p>
      <p>However, thanks to a marijuana supply glut and concerns over vaping, instead, the company faces a cash crunch. With the Hexo stock price now below $2 per share, further dilution is not much of an option.</p>
      <p>Also, even with low liabilities, debt financing can only help them sustain quarters like the previous one for a limited time. Hexo is not dead yet. However, if it saves itself, it will not happen without more pain.</p>
