      <p>The Delhi High Court on Friday said it will not issue any direction to the Parliament for drafting a uniform civil code (UCC) noting that the matter falls under the domain of the legislature.</p>
      <p>A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice C. Hari Shankar, however, allowed the petitioners, including BJP leader Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay, to argue their respective cases.</p>
      <p>During the day’s hearing, the Bench heard arguments on behalf of petitioners Firoz Bakht Ahmed, the chancellor of Maulana Azad National Urdu University, and Amber Zaidi, who claims to be a social activist and media personality.</p>
      <h3>Counter affidavit</h3>
      <p>It will continue to hear arguments on behalf of the others, including Mr. Upadhyay on Monday. Mr. Upadhyay, who is also a lawyer, told the Bench that it had issued notice to the Centre in this matter on May 31 and till date, no counter affidavit has been filed by the government.</p>
      <p>However, the court declined to do so and said if the government does not want to file a response, let it not. All the petitioners have contended that India “urgently needs a uniform civil code” to promote national integration as well as gender justice, equality and dignity of women.</p>
      <p>All the petitions have sought directions to the Centre to constitute a judicial commission or a high-level expert committee to draft the UCC while considering the best practices of all religions and sects, civil laws of developed countries and international conventions.</p>
