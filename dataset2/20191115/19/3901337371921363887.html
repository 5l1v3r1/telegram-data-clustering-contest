      <p>Griezmann joined Barca at the beginning of the season from Atletico Madrid for a reported fee of €120 million (R1.9 billion), and was expected to form a prolific partnership with Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez.</p>
      <p>Things have not quite gone to plan for the 2018 FIFA World Cup winner, though, as he has struggled to perform on the left side of Barcelona's attack, with either Messi or Suarez being deployed in his preferred central position.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old was questioned about his role at Barca after France's 2-1 win over Moldova on Thursday night, and he revealed that he is still getting used to the positional shift.</p>

      <p>"It is certain that playing in the axis is better for me," Griezmann said, as reported by <i>RMC</i>.</p>
      <p>"I have my bearings. I've been managing this position for years and years.</p>
      <p>"I have a new club. I have to adapt. I am still learning. I knew on arrival that it was going to be hard, I knew it very well."</p>
