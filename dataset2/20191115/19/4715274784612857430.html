      <p>A new product and technique was introduced lately by the hair expert called Straight Xpress, and as the name implies, Reyes promises that women can have long silky straight locks with this revolutionary hair treatment.</p>
      <p>Straight Xpress is the result, a worthy result of Reyes’s long period of close collaboration with personal care laboratories abroad that helped him formulate this straightening innovation that leaves hair no damage and further solve women’s hair woes. </p>
      <p>The result is stunning. Now, with Ricky Reyes, Straight Xpress, women can have perfectly straightened hair that is smooth and manageable as well.</p>
      <p>What is more important is that Straight Xpress lessens processing time to less than an hour and at a fraction of a cost of rebonding.</p>
      <p>As Reyes said, “There’s a big demand for long, straight hairstyle among Filipino women. It’s no fun if it isn’t smooth, silky and manageable. Our new Straight Xpress method delivers all that. I want our women to have that winning looks of a true beauty queen, truly Filipina, truly fabulosa.”</p>
