      <p>Â </p>
      <p>The Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, has directed that with effect from Friday 15th November, 2019, all security aides attached to the Governors, their Deputies and all other public office holders, politicians and any other personality involved in the elections in the Bayelsa and Kogi States be withdrawn until the conclusion of the elections.</p>
      <p>Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Police in charge of operations at the Force Headquarters, DIG Abdulmajid Ali, who made this known to reporters, said as part of actions directed at Policing, the entry and exit points into Kogi and Bayelsa States from contiguous States shall be closed as from 12am of 16th November to 4pm of 16th November, 2019.</p>
      <p>He said there shall also be restriction of movements within the two states as from 6am to 4pm of 16th November, 2019, with the exemption of those on election duties and essential services.</p>
      <p>According to him, they have made adequate deployments to guarantee adequate security for the elections.</p>
      <p>He said IGP Adamu has ordered the posting of very senior police officers including Deputy Inspectors-General of Police (DIGs), AIGs, CPs, DCPs and ACPs to all senatorial districts and Local Government Areas within the two states to monitor security arrangements during the elections.</p>
      <p>He said they were aware of possible security issues that misguide political actors may try to create during the elections and warned that anyone harbouring such intentions should desist.</p>
      <p>He said the police will identify, isolate and bring deserved justice to any person or group of persons that attempt to threaten the elections in both states.</p>
