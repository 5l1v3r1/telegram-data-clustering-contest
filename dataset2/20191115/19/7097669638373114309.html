      <p>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — A Nicaraguan judge sentenced a man to 30 years behind bars in the killing of a young nursing student in upstate New York, a district attorney in the state said Friday.</p>
      <p>The trial of Orlando Tercero in the 2018 killing of Haley Anderson marked an exceedingly rare legal proceeding in which the defendant was prosecuted under Nicaragua’s legal system for a slaying that happened on American soil. Tercero is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Nicaragua.</p>
      <p>Authorities said Tercero strangled Anderson, 22, at his off-campus residence in Binghamton, New York, in March 2018 and then fled to Nicaragua, which rejected an extradition request from the U.S. but instead decided to try him. <a href="https://www.pressconnects.com/story/news/local/2019/11/01/orlando-tercero-found-guilty-murder-haley-anderson/4107653002/">The Binghamton Press &amp; Sun-Bulletin</a> previously reported that the defense argued Tercero may have been provoked.</p>
      <p>Legal experts say Tercero, if he is ever extradited, could still be prosecuted for the killing under the U.S. legal system.</p>
      <p>Anderson, who was from Westbury on Long Island, was found dead in Tercero’s bed. The two students had a romantic relationship, but Tercero wanted a more serious one, according to witness testimony at trial.</p>
      <p>Broome County District Attorney Steve Cornwell said Tercero received the maximum prison sentence under Nicaraguan law. The Nicaraguan judge found Tercero guilty of femicide earlier this month, he said.</p>
      <p>Cornwell said he still would have preferred that Tercero be extradited and face trial in the U.S., but he described Nicaraguan process as the second-best option.</p>
      <p>“It’s the best outcome that we could have had under the circumstances,” he said Friday.</p>
      <p>The Broome County District Attorney’s office in New York was deeply involved as a facilitator for witness testimony but had no authority over the trial. The witnesses testified, with the help of a translator, via a video link from a room in the district attorney’s office in downtown Binghamton.</p>
      <p>On one day of testimony last month, Anderson’s friends and supporters watched the grainy livestream from a wood-paneled viewing room. That same day, a police investigator testified that Tercero left a note at his residence saying he was sorry.</p>
      <p>It’s unusual for a person to be tried in another country under a foreign legal system for a killing that took place on in the U.S., but it’s not an unprecedented legal proceeding.</p>
      <p>From his perspective, Cornwell said he saw an experienced judge run a tight courtroom and a prosecutor who appeared to have handled high-level cases before.</p>
      <p>He also praised Nicaraguan authorities, saying they stepped up and fought for Anderson as if she was their own victim.</p>
      <p>“We are all very thankful,” he said.</p>
