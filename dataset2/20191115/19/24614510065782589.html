      <p><b>JD.com</b> (NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/jd-stock-quote/"><b><u>JD</u></b></a>) earnings for the Chinese e-commerce company’s <a href="https://ir.jd.com/news-releases/news-release-details/jdcom-announces-third-quarter-2019-results">third quarter of 2019</a> have JD stock down on Friday. This is despite the company announcing Non-GAAP EPS of 29 cents on revenue of $18.87 billion. These are both better than Wall Street’s estimates of 17 cents per share and $18.13 billion.</p>
