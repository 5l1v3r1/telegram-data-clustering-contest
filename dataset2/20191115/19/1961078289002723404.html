        <b>To the Editor:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Regarding the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/us/politics/impeachment-hearings.html?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Homepage">testimony of Marie Yovanovitch</a>, the former United States ambassador to Ukraine, before the House Intelligence Committee’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/us/politics/marie-yovanovitch-testimony.html?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Homepage">impeachment hearings on Friday</a>:</p>
      <p>The great public congressional hearings often start slow and continue without making apparent progress toward a solution to the problem they address. Then suddenly there is a “eureka!” moment when quiet, civilly spoken words cast a light so bright that the public and their elected representatives cannot ignore or fail to right grievous wrongs.</p>
      <p>Friday marked such a turning point for Trumpism and the Trump administration.</p>
      <p>Any American citizen paying attention to the opening statement and testimony of Ms. Yovanovitch will experience a historic eureka moment.</p>
      <p>This brave and heroic woman has no agenda other than to serve the country she loves. Her clear, straightforward depiction of the abuse and smears she received and the corruption of United States foreign policy and security to serve the political and financial interests of the president and his enablers cannot be ignored or dismissed.</p>
      <p>Ambassador Yovanovitch deserves a Presidential Medal of Freedom. Instead she is defamed, dismissed and threatened.</p>
      <p>Anyone, including the president and the Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee, who continues to attack Ambassador Yovanovitch will do so at considerable risk.</p>
      <p>The American people deserve and expect their elected leaders to put the public interest ahead of their own personal interest in power and greed. They want them to make sure that those in power are accountable and that they uphold the rule of law. Members of Congress who do not fulfill their responsibility to the American people will be held accountable by voters.</p>

      <p>President Trump tweeting in real time while Marie Yovanovitch was testifying before the House Intelligence Committee may or may not amount to intimidation of a witness.</p>
      <p>That said, it’s time to remind all Americans what Joseph Welch said during the 1954 Army-McCarthy hearings: “Have you no sense of decency, sir?”</p>
      <p>This same question needs to be asked now of President Trump.</p>

      <p>Re “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/us/politics/pelosi-impeachment-bribery.html?searchResultPosition=1&amp;module=inline">Pelosi Suggests Trump May Face Bribery Charge</a>” (front page, Nov. 15):</p>
      <p>Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s decision to call President Trump’s behavior “bribery” is crucial.</p>
      <p>I am a psychiatrist. I focus on the emotional impact of words all day long. I urge the Democrats to repeatedly explain, in simple terms, what Mr. Trump did and why it matters.</p>
      <p>For example, please don’t say, “President Trump used the power of his office to seek damaging information on his political rival.” Please say: “President Trump is a cheat. He has been a cheat all his life. He bribed Ukraine for dirt on Joe Biden so he could cheat and win the next election.”</p>
      <p>Please say why this matters, so every American can get it: Even if Mr. Trump gets 5 percent of Americans to think that there must have been some corruption involving Vice President Biden, that can easily be enough to change the outcome of our next election.</p>
      <p>That’s why it matters. Democrats: Make it clear and stick to it.</p>
