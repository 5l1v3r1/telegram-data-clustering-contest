      <p>PARIS (Reuters) - The leaders of France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine will meet in Paris on Dec. 9 in an attempt to advance efforts for a peaceful resolution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine, the French presidency said on Friday.</p>
      <p>It will be the first time the leaders have met together in more than three years and comes after a breakthrough at talks between Russia and Ukraine last month.</p>
      <p>“The summit will be held following major progress since the summer in negotiations for a settlement in the east Ukraine conflict, progress which in particular allowed the removal of troops from several areas on the frontline,” the Elysee Palace said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Over 13,000 people have been killed in the more than five-year-old conflict in east Ukraine between pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian government forces.</p>
      <p>Relations between Ukraine and Russia collapsed following Moscow’s annexation of the Crimean peninsula in 2014, which prompted Western sanctions. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy won a landslide election victory in April promising to end the simmering conflict.</p>
      <p>Zelenskiy’s office put out a separate statement on Friday, saying Macron had assured Ukraine of his support and that the Dec. 9 date had been agreed by all parties. The Kremlin has not commented so far.</p>
      <p>Envoys from Moscow and Kiev agreed at talks in early October on an election schedule for the separatist region and on legislation giving it special status.</p>
      <p>Ukrainian government forces and Russian-backed rebels also began withdrawing from a village in the disputed Donbass region on Saturday, helping pave the way for the so-called Normandy summit, which takes its name from a meeting of the four nations’ leaders in the northwestern French region in 2014.</p>

      <p>“The French President stressed that Ukraine had fulfilled all necessary conditions for the Normandy format summit to take place,” the statement said.</p>
      <p>“Emmanuel Macron emphasized that Ukraine could further count on France’s support in all matters,” it added.</p>
