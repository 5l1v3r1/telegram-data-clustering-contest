      <h1>Robert Downey Jr. Will Voice Iron Man in What If? Disney+ Series</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T19:05:48+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 19:05</time> by <a rel="author">Tudor Leonte</a></address>
      <p>It seems like Robert Downey Jr.’s goodbye to the Marvel Cinematic Universe won’t last long. Even though at the moment it doesn’t seem likely he will return in the flesh, he will voice Iron Man in the upcoming <b><a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/what-if">What If…?</a> </b>Disney+ series. Speaking with BuzzFeed, actor Jeff Goldblum broke the news adding that also Taika Waititi will reprise his Korg character (via <a href="https://comicbook.com/marvel/2019/11/15/iron-man-tony-stark-mcu-return-disney-what-if-series/">ComicBook</a>).</p>
      <p>“I played the part again a couple of days ago,” Goldblum said. “I went to the Disney studios and I recorded the Grandmaster’s voice for an episode of a show that’s gonna be on Disney+ that’s called <b>What If…?</b>…This episode included the Grandmaster and Iron Man, so Robert Downey will do a voice for that, and Korg, Taika Waititi had already recorded his voice for that.”</p>

      <p>Robert Downey Jr.’s last appearance in the MCU dates back to <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/avengers-endgame"><b>Avengers: Endgame</b></a> when he completed his run as Iron Man. At the moment, there are no plans for his return to live-action in the future. Fans of Downey Jr.’s Tony Stark will have to settle for him voicing Iron Man once again.</p>
      <p><b>What If…?</b> is an animated anthology series that looks at alternate histories in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. What if things happened differently? If Peggy Carter got the super-soldier serum rather than Steve Rogers, for example? Or somebody other than Peter Quill became Star-Lord? Uatu the Watcher, played by Jeffrey Wright, will guide us through these possibilities, and many of the MCU’s stars return to voice their characters. Downey’s confirmation, however, is new. The original <b>What If…?</b> comic book series debuted in 1977, resulting in 13 series and several stand-alones.</p>
