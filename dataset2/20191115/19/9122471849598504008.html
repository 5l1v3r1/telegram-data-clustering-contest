      <h1>Ohio State at Rutgers: Game Time, Spread, Channel, Announcers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T19:11:06+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 19:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>It’ll be hard to find a more lopsided matchup than the one taking place in New Jersey this weekend. On Saturday, the Ohio State Buckeyes will look to keep their undefeated season alive when they face the Rutgers Scarlet Knights.</p>
      <p>Chase Young <a href="https://thespun.com/big-ten/ohio-state-buckeyes/ohio-state-ncaa-length-of-chase-young-suspension">will not play this Saturday</a> as he serves the final game of his suspension from the NCAA.</p>
      <p>Regardless that Young won’t be available for this matchup, the Buckeyes have more than enough firepower to win on Saturday. The Scarlet Knights only average 14.7 points per game.</p>
      <p>Justin Fields and J.K. Dobbins should have the chance to boost their stats this weekend against a defense that recently gave up 38 points to Illinois.</p>
      <p>Rutgers hasn’t shown much promise this season, which is exactly why the betting line for this game is ridiculously high.</p>
