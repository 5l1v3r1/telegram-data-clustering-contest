      <h1>Melavalavu case: HC lets advocate appear as party-in-person</h1>
      <h2>Court registry had doubts about the maintainability of the petition</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T19:14:56+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 19:14</time> by <a rel="author">Staff Reporter</a></address>
      <p>The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Friday permitted advocate P. Rathinam to file a writ petition, in the capacity as party-in-person, seeking a direction to the State to furnish the government order on the release of 13 convicts in the Melavalavu massacre case.</p>
      <p>After the writ petition was filed by advocate Rathinam in the individual capacity as party-in-person, the High Court Registry had doubts about the maintainability of the petition in view of Rule 3 (3) of the High Court of Madras (Conduct of Proceedings by Party-In-Person) Rules, 2019.</p>
      <p>The rule stipulates that a party-in-person includes a person who intends to plead, appear and argue his or her own case before the High Court and not through an advocate.</p>
      <h3>Qualified for the task</h3>
      <p>Mr. Rathinam told the registry that since he was an advocate himself, there was no bar to appear as party-in-person.</p>
      <p>When the writ petition was listed ‘for maintainability’ before the court, he argued that under Rule 10, the court had the power to exercise its discretion to permit a litigant to appear-in-person and conduct the proceedings in court.</p>
      <p>A Division Bench of Justices S. Vaidyanathan and N. Anand Venkatesh observed that when Rule 10 gave discretionary power to the court, it had to be used liberally.</p>
      <p>The court said that if affected persons were not permitted to appear before the court as party-in-person, they would not be in a position to defend the matter effectively and rules should not come in the way to prevent an affected person to represent a case before the court. The court directed the Registry to get an undertaking under Form B as per Rule 8 (b) to ensure that the decorum of the court was maintained.</p>
      <p>The undertaking should be given in the prescribed format along with photo identity proof and current address with mobile number.</p>
      <p>If the documents were in order, the Registry shall number and list the writ petition for admission on November 18, it said.</p>
