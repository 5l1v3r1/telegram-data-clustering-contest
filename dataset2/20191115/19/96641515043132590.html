      <h1>CNBC: T-Mobile CEO John Legere won't be the next WeWork CEO</h1>
      <h2>Legere is still working to complete T-Mobile's merger with Sprint.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T19:15:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 19:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.facebook.com/richard.lawler" target="_blank">Richard Lawler</a></address>
      <p>Earlier this week T-Mobile CEO John Legere's name <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/11/wework-ceo-john-legere-t-mobile-report/">popped up as a possibility to take over the top spot at WeWork</a> after its failed IPO and ouster of co-founder Adam Neumann. However, subsequent rumors clarified that he was just one of the potential replacements, while today <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/15/john-legere-isnt-leaving-t-mobile-to-take-wework-ceo-job.html"><i>CNBC</i></a> reports that Legere isn't taking the job and has "no plans" to leave T-Mobile.</p>
      <p>The report also cites people with knowledge of the matter as saying he was not the top candidate for the job, which would have presented a tricky transition as Softbank is both the majority owner of WeWork, and Sprint, which his company is still in the process of merging with.</p>
