      <p>She had a bud in the oven.</p>
      <p>A woman posing as pregnant in Argentina was allegedly busted with 9 pounds of marijuana stashed in a fake baby bump, according to officials and reports.</p>
      <p>The unnamed gal and a male friend were crossing the country’s border into Chile by bus when they were stopped at a checkpoint near Mendoza this week, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/drug-smuggler-hid-four-kilos-cannabis-fake-baby-bump-11147786/">according to the UK Metro</a>.</p>
      <p>Officers searched her bag and found two bricks of cannabis — then 15 more, held together with paste, inside a phony wearable stomach constructed with glue, according to the outlet.</p>
      <p>“She made a belly out of paste, hid 15 cannabis bricks inside it and faked a pregnancy before trying to take it from Mendoza to Santa Cruz,” Argentina’s Minister for Security Patricia Bullrich <a href="https://twitter.com/PatoBullrich/status/1194707663206125568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1194707663206125568&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.news18.com%2Fnews%2Fbuzz%2Fpregnant-woman-caught-smuggling-4-kg-cannabis-inside-fake-baby-bump-in-argentina-2386857.html">tweeted</a> along with photos Wednesday.</p>
      <p>“The pretend mom-to-be and her accomplice were arrested.”</p>
      <p>A police spokesman said the pregnant poser was “asked to leave the [bus] and it was confirmed she was also carrying drugs and no baby inside of her,” according to the outlet.</p>
      <p>In total, her special delivery weighed about 4 kilos, and she was charged with drug smuggling.</p>
      <p>Authorities believe she and the man were headed to Santa Oliva in Patagonia, according to the outlet.</p>
