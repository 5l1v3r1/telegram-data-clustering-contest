      <p>As someone who doesn’t like lobster (yes, these people exist), please take me seriously when I say that the crustaceans at Burger &amp; Lobster are <i>really</i> good.</p>
      <p>Following the insane queues at the chain’s Jewel Changi Airport store earlier this year, the UK chain opened a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.sg/burger-and-lobsters-new-raffles-outlet-opens-sept-27-and-sells-s70-lobster-laksa/">second flagship store</a> at the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&amp;cx=015239699409667828236:iq5qyi-dcs0&amp;q=https://www.businessinsider.sg/photos-the-renovated-arcade-of-raffles-hotel-is-now-open-and-itll-be-home-to-burger-lobsters-flagship-store/&amp;sa=U&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjCvqKT6-vlAhVm7nMBHeEmDVYQFjAEegQICBAC&amp;usg=AOvVaw3BlNLUXgj2Z7ui2HA4W2O1">newly-renovated Raffles Hotel</a> in September.</p>
      <p><i>Business Insider</i> ate at the new restaurant as part of an invited media tasting on Thursday (Nov 14).</p>
      <p>Here’s how the eight-course meal went:</p>

      <h3>After the success of its Jewel Changi outlet, popular UK chain Burger &amp; Lobster now has a second restaurant in Raffles Hotel.</h3>

      <h3>It was spacious – and rather empty on a Thursday night.</h3>

      <h3>On one end of the restaurant was a tank of lobsters, just like in Chinese joints.</h3>

      <h3>All the dishes we tried that night were only available at Burger &amp; Lobster’s Raffles Place outlet.</h3>
      <h3>First on the menu was a small seafood platter (S$120). I was completely blown away by the Alaskan King Crab leg, which contained the best crab meat I had eaten in my life: sweet, delicious meat juices exploded in my mouth when it bit into the soft flesh.</h3>
      <h3>Unfortunately, the neighbouring oysters were sandy and a bit of a let down.</h3>

      <hr/>
      <h3>Next was fried octopus leg with parsley (S$16). I was happily surprised that the thick meat was not rubbery.</h3>

      <hr/>
      <h3>After that came a kale and quinoa salad with lobster, avocado, and cranberries (S$22).</h3>
      <h3>While some might object to buying salad, everyone at the table ended up loving this dish for its good balance of flavours and silky shredded lobster.</h3>

      <hr/>
      <h3>Alongside the salad, we had lobster and guacamole on rosti (S$18). I enjoyed the combination of crispy potato ribbons, sour-spicy guac, and succulent lobster.</h3>
      <h3>However, don’t try to pass off this starter as a main dish – the portion will likely be too small.</h3>

      <p>Business Insider/Rachel Chia</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Next came the only major disappointment of the night – the rather forgettable spicy miso burger (S$23).</h3>
      <h3>The bun and patty were dry, and the miso sauce spread thin and sparse.</h3>

      <h3>Faring slightly better was the beef brisket roll (S$25) made of angus beef and topped with spiced rum.</h3>

      <p>Business Insider/Rachel Chia</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Honestly, I couldn’t taste any rum – and while the meat was juicy and generously portioned, I wouldn’t return to Burger &amp; Lobster just to eat beef brisket.</h3>

      <h3>Following the beef brisket was its far more sophisticated and glamorous cousin, the lobster roll with caviar and sea urchin (S$50).</h3>
      <h3>When this dish came, the everyone’s eyes lit up. I couldn’t help but bask in how shamelessly luxurious it was.</h3>

      <h3>I much preferred the brioche in this roll to the burger bun. The buttery bread was warm and crisp on the outside, and pillowy soft within.</h3>
      <h3>As for the filling, the lobster portion was generous, and the taste and smell of creamy sea urchin (both raw and in the sauce) permeated every bite, peppered by bursts of ocean saltiness from the caviar.</h3>

      <h3>Last was the pièce de résistance: S$70 lobster laksa, the outlet’s specialty. (Every Burger &amp; Lobster outlet has a specialty dish).</h3>
      <h3>The laksa was rich, heavy on coconut milk and barely spicy.</h3>
      <h3>The noodles were springy and well cooked – the best laksa noodles I’d ever had – and the lobster meat (particularly the claws) was succulent, sweet, and simply heavenly.</h3>
      <figure>

      <p>Business Insider/Rachel Chia</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Initially, the price tag on this dish was hard to swallow. But after I realised that a steamed lobster costs S$65, adding on S$5 for noodles, beansprouts, and good-quality laksa gravy seemed like a great deal.</h3>

      <h3>I also tried two mocktails (S$12 each), one with pineapple and ginger beer, and the other with grapefruit and tonic.</h3>
      <h3>If you don’t mind the slight bitterness of grapefruit, the latter was the better complement to the meal, as it cut through the rich dishes.</h3>

      <h3>The bill for these dishes came to S$416.52 after GST.</h3>

      <p>In all, I can see why this chain makes for a great birthday spot: Burger &amp; Lobster honestly shines when it comes to lobsters: fresh, cooked perfectly, and happily spared from the dry,rubbery texture that put me off lobster dishes in the past. (The Alaskan King crab is also worth a special mention.)</p>
      <p>However, I found the miso burger simply underwhelming, and the beef brisket in bread tasty but too simple to command a S$25 price tag.</p>
      <p>Overall, this was a meal I’d never forget. However, S$400 is practically a small fortune, so save this one for very special occasions, and go crazy on the seafood.</p>
