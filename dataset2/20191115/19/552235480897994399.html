      <h1>New Kilbirnie Ladeside boss on challenge of replacing 'best pal' in dugout</h1>
      <h2>Robert Scott admits club have taken "massive risk" in handing him his first managerial job but insists he's ready for role.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T19:17:19+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 19:17</time> by <a rel="author">Eric McGowan, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/eric-mcgowan/</a></address>
      <p>New Kilbirnie Ladeside boss Robert Scott insists he's ready to cope with a managerial baptism of fire after replacing best pal Liam McGuinness in the Blasties' hotseat.</p>
      <p>Scott was promoted from his coaching role at the club on Monday in a reshuffling of the pack at the West Premiership side that sees McGuinness retained as a player.</p>
      <p>It's a rather unusual set of circumstances that would provide food for thought for a seasoned gaffer, never mind a rookie like Scott in his first managerial job.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>In the space of less than three weeks, Scott has gone from taking orders from McGuinness to being in a position of issuing them to him.</p>
      <p>Scott, 36, admits his appointment is a gamble but insists McGuinness' continued presence at the club will be a massive help to him.</p>
      <p>"Liam is a great lad," he said. "We grew up in Kilbirnie together and he's my best pal.</p>
      <p>"He's the kind of boy you would want in any dressing room.</p>
      <p>"He's still one of the best footballers in the league so it's great for us that he wants to keep playing.</p>

      <p>"When he was the manager he kept that camaraderie with the dressing room so all the players are delighted to have him in there."</p>
      <p>Scott won't be making any sweeping changes to a team that currently sits fourth in table as he finds his feet in the Valefield Park spotlight.</p>
      <p>He has however moved quickly to promote Steven McCreadie to the No2 role and brought in Brian Sproul and Steve Morrison to boost the coaching staff.</p>
      <p>"Listen, I know the club is taking a massive risk given my lack of managerial experience,"  Scott addeed.</p>
      <p>"I put my name in the hat for the job but never really expected to get it.</p>
      <p>"I do feel ready for the challenge though and I'll be giving it my very best shot.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"Coaching badges mean very little in Junior football but I've been coaching for 15 years and completed my A licence.</p>
      <p>"I've worked with the likes of Ayr United and Kilmarnock and while this is something completely different for me, I can't wait to get started."</p>
      <p>"We've got an excellent squad here and we're maybe a wee bit unfortunate not to be a wee bit higher in the table."</p>
      <p>Scott is hoping to add his own stamp to a Blasties side that has scored a healthy 27 goals in 14 league games but shipped 22 at the other end.</p>
      <p>He went on: "I like to get in to the finer details, look at the opposition and give players individual roles on the park.</p>
      <p>"I can't see there being many changes to the squad before Christmas. Having Steve Morrison and Brian Sproul around will let us look at things with fresh eyes so we will reassess things as we go on."</p>

      <p>Kilbirnie's committee issued a statement heralding Scott's appointment on the club website.</p>
      <p>It said: "A lot of soul searching has been done by the committee during this time as we took stock of the situation and identified where we needed to go.</p>
      <p>The appointment of coach Robert Scott to the new Ladeside manager gives stability to the club, him and Stevie McCreadie have worked well under Liam and are highly respected by the playing squad.</p>
      <p>"There is little doubt changes need to be made to improve on the field results and eradicate slips up when we should be recording better results.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"The team showed a good bit of resolve in our last two games v Beith &amp; Cumbernauld Utd, that progress will hopefully continue under Robert."</p>
      <p>"Once again we call upon our supporters to back their football club as much as they can this season as they have done in the past."</p>
      <p>Scott will take charge of the Blasties for the first time on Saturday when Rutherglen Glencairn visit Valefield on league duty.</p>
