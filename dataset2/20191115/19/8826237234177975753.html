      <h1>Hulu Is Raising Its Prices for Live TV for the Second Time This Year</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T19:28:53+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 19:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://time.com/author/associated-press/" target="_blank">Tali Arbel / AP</a></address>
      <p>Hulu is again raising prices for its online TV bundle, as other streaming-TV providers do the same.</p>
      <p>Hulu’s service, like AT&amp;T TV Now, Dish’s Sling and YouTube TV, are a replica of traditional TV but on the internet. They were once vaunted as a successor to traditional cable. But the market has lost steam as prices rise. One early entrant, Sony’s PlayStation Vue, is shutting down, and analysts expect others to follow.</p>
      <p>The entertainment industry’s attention has shifted to new and <a href="https://time.com/5703656/best-streaming-services/">upcoming streaming services</a> like Apple <a href="https://time.com/5710943/apple-tv-plus-what-to-watch/">TV Plus</a>, Disney <a href="https://time.com/5699832/disney-plus-movies-shows/">Plus</a>, AT&amp;T’s HBO Max and Comcast’s Peacock.</p>
      <p>Hulu with Live TV’s price <a href="https://www.hulu.com/press/hulu-update/update-on-hulu-live-tv/">will rise</a> $10, to $55 a month, in December. Prices had risen $5 in February.</p>
      <p>The Disney-owned streaming provider’s traditional video-on-demand service will remain at $6 a month.</p>
