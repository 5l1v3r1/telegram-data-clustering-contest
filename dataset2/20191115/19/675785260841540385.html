      <h1>General election 2019: Boris Johnson fails to disown endorsement from Tommy Robinson</h1>
      <h2>Earlier today Robinson gave his backing to the Prime Minister and the Lib Dems called on him to publicly reject it</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T19:53:23+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 19:53</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Bloom, Oliver Milne, https://www.facebook.com/mirrordanbloom, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/oliver-milne/</a></address>
      <p>Boris Johnson has failed to reject the endorsement of far-right activist Tommy Robinson - despite demands from the Liberal Democrats that he disavow his support.</p>
      <p>Earlier today the far-right extremist gave his backing to the Prime Minister.</p>
      <p>Asked about Brexit he said: “Everyone should vote for Boris Johnson.</p>
      <p>“And I’m so happy with what Nigel Farage has done.</p>
      <p>"He should attack the Labour heartlands, if we want Brexit, if we believe in democracy, we have to have Brexit.</p>
      <p>"So yeah. Go Boris.”</p>
      <p>Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley Lennon, made the comments outside the High Court where he faces a libel claim over a comment he made online about a Syrian refugee attacked in a school playground. He denies the claim.</p>

      <p>Jo Swinson wrote to Mr Johnson to ask him to "publicly reject" the endorsement.</p>
      <p>But contacted by the Mirror, a spokeswoman for Boris Johnson declined to comment.</p>
      <p>Ms Swinson wrote: "Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also known as Tommy Robinson, today encouraged people to vote for you in the general election.”</p>
      <p>She adds: “There should be no place for figures such as Yaxley-Lennon in British politics and his endorsement should be anathema to any candidate seeking to improve the lives of people across the UK.</p>
      <p>“Hate crimes are on the rise across the UK and politics has been blighted by threats and violent language. It is incumbent on all those in the public eye to reject toxic rhetoric and figures who seek to sow division and fear.”</p>
      <p>Labour Party Chair Ian Lavery said: "Admired by Donald Trump, aided by Nigel Farage, and endorsed by Tommy Robinson. With friends like these, who needs Boris Johnson?</p>
      <p>"While Johnson is courting billionaires and far right thugs, Labour is running the most radical, people powered campaign this country has ever seen."</p>
