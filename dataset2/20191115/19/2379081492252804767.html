      <h1>Yields rise on fresh hopes of trade deal</h1>

      <p>NEW YORK — U.S. Treasury yields rose on</p>
      <p>Friday as fresh hopes that the United States and China will</p>
      <p>reach a deal to de-escalate their trade war boosted risk</p>
      <p>appetite, and reduced demand for U.S. government bonds.</p>
      <p>Yield gains were pared, however, after retail sales data for</p>
      <p>October failed to meet expectations and raised concerns about a</p>
      <p>soft holiday shopping season.</p>
      <p>The United States and China are getting close to a trade</p>
      <p>agreement, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on</p>
      <p>Thursday, citing what he called very constructive talks with</p>
      <p>Beijing about ending a 16-month trade war.</p>
      <p>The comments come after several media reports indicated that</p>
      <p>negotiators are struggling to reach a deal.</p>
      <p>The Financial Times reported on Thursday that the countries</p>
      <p>are having a hard time agreeing on issues including intellectual</p>
      <p>property, agricultural purchases and tariffs.</p>
      <p>“Overnight, there were some positive trade headlines so you</p>
      <p>had rates under a little bit of pressure, giving back some of</p>
      <p>the gains this week,” said Justin Lederer, an interest rate</p>
      <p>strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York.</p>
      <p>Benchmark 10-year notes dropped 4/32 in price to</p>
      <p>yield 1.833%, up from 1.815% late Thursday.</p>
      <p>Bonds prices have gained this week as optimism over a trade</p>
      <p>deal ebbed, retracing some of last week’s dramatic selloff.</p>
      <p>Ten-year note yields rose to 1.973% on Nov. 7,</p>
      <p>which was the highest since Aug. 1, and have climbed from 1.670%</p>
      <p>on Nov. 1.</p>
      <p>Data on Friday showed that U.S. retail sales rebounded in</p>
      <p>October, but consumers cut back on purchases of big-ticket</p>
      <p>household items and clothing, which could temper expectations</p>
      <p>for a strong holiday shopping season.</p>
      <p>The data was “all in all a little weaker than expected,”</p>
      <p>Lederer said.</p>
      <p>Other data also showed that U.S. industrial production fell</p>
      <p>faster than expected in October as output for the manufacturing,</p>
      <p>mining and utilities sectors fell.</p>
