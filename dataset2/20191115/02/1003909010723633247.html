      <h1>City council members ask what province's Fair Deal panel will mean for Calgary</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T02:11:06+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 02:11</time> by <a rel="author">Meghan Potkins, Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>Some city council members are wondering what the UCP’s fair deal panel will mean for Calgary.</p>
      <p>An urgent notice of motion that could be tabled at Monday’s council meeting endorses <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/kenney-reveals-fair-deal-plan-to-assess-alberta-run-pension-police-and-tax-collection">Premier Jason Kenney’s recently unveiled vision</a> for a panel dedicated to exploring a “fair deal for Alberta” within Confederation.</p>
      <p>The panel is expected to tackle questions including whether Alberta should pull out of the Canada Pension Plan; whether it should create a provincial police force instead of relying on the RCMP for rural policing; and whether Alberta should establish a formal provincial constitution.</p>
      <p>Four of council’s right-leaning members have co-signed the motion, which calls on the city to make a formal submission to the panel based on “Calgary’s perspective and interests” that would be drafted ahead of the Jan. 30 deadline.</p>
      <p>“The approach that’s being taken by the provincial government is a good one, it’s a step in the right direction for more fairness for Alberta,” said Coun. Jeromy Farkas, who co-signed the motion. “But we need to make sure that we run the numbers, that we make sure that it does reduce the cost of government and it eliminates red tape, rather than increasing it.”</p>
      <p>Some council members said Thursday that they hoped to avoid what occurred with the province’s previous panel. The <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/alberta-government-panel-recommends-cities-towns-shoulder-more-building-costs">MacKinnon blue-ribbon panel on Alberta’s finances, released in September ahead of the provincial budget</a>, took a hard stance on funding for municipalities and did not consult with the city.</p>
      <p>“In the last panel, there were some issues that came forward that I would’ve loved to have the city have (an) impact on, or at least some conversations had,” said Coun. Peter Demong, who also signed the motion.</p>
      <p>“We weren’t involved in the last panel. (This) time around, we should be looking at what the potential downsides are, what the potential issues might be at play for the City of Calgary and what kind of mitigations we should be looking at setting up for the city.”</p>

      <p>Other signatories to the motion include councillors Sean Chu and Joe Magliocca.</p>
      <p>The motion comes on the heels of recent <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/alberta-independence-ideas-would-increase-costs-says-calgary-mayor/wcm/45bc2ed3-77c4-4020-8ee0-eab5a5b0a4e4">comments by Mayor Naheed Nenshi that were critical of the fair deal panel</a>, suggesting some of the proposed measures, if enacted, would likely result in “increased costs.”</p>
      <p>Farkas denounced the mayor’s remarks Thursday, suggesting it was premature for him to comment.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think it’s appropriate for the mayor at this time to say that costs would necessarily go up because, frankly, nobody has done that work,” said Farkas. “The panel hasn’t begun its work, Albertans have not yet been consulted.”</p>
