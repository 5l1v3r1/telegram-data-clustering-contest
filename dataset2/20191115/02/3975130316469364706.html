      <h1>The Black Death Plague Just Reappeared In China</h1>

      <p>At least two people in China are under close observation and <a href="https://bgr.com/2019/11/14/plague-news-china-black-death/">are receiving treatment for infections of the same plague that devastated Europe in the mid-1300s</a>. The two confirmed cases originated in north China and were confirmed by doctors in Beijing earlier this week. From a report: <i>The pneumonic variant of the plague, which affects the lungs, can easily spread to others through the air. It is one of the three main forms of plague infection, alongside bubonic and septicemic, but it's believed that the pneumonic form was largely responsible for the rapid spread of plague during the Black Death pandemic that wiped out as much as half of Europe's population centuries ago. While it hasn't led to a full-scale pandemic for some time, plague -- a bacterial infection that is treated with antibiotics -- is known to persist in certain animal populations across Asia as well as the Americas and Africa. The pneumonic form, however, is rare and considered to be a more serious threat. It is almost always deadly if not promptly treated. </i>China's <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-11/12/c_138549881.htm">Xinhua news agency</a> didn't provide many details on the condition of the two patients or if they had contact with others. The report simply notes that "relevant disease prevention and control measures have been taken."</p>
