      <p>Online survival games don’t have the best track record when it comes to competent console conversions, but let’s hope that <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/rust">Rust</a> bucks this sorry trend. Due out on the PlayStation 4 next year after becoming something of a phenomenon on PC, the release will see you attempting to stay alive in a world where “everything wants you dead”.</p>
      <p>“Conquer thirst and hunger, battle the elements, create clothing, and stay safe against hostile forces including other players, scientists, bears, wolves, or even succumb to fire, drowning, or radiation poisoning,” the press release reads. “A game without rules, Rust doesn’t tell its inhabitants what to do.”</p>
      <p>The origins of this title date all the way back to 2013, when it first launched in Early Access on Steam. It’s since attracted over eight million players to its servers, with the PS4 release likely to significantly increase those numbers next year. Double Eleven’s been roped in on development duties, with original developer Facepunch also involved.</p>
