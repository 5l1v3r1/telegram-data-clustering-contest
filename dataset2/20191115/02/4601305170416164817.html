      <h1>San Diego's wonderful Mysterious Galaxy Books has lost its lease, needs a buyer ASAP to stay afloat</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T02:15:29+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 02:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/cory_doctorow_1" target="_blank">Cory Doctorow</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mystgalaxy.com/">Mysterious Galaxy</a> is a wonderful, longstanding science fiction bookstore, host to readings for the Clarion Workshop, designated bookseller for Comic-Con signings, and much more.</p>
      <p>And while the 27-year-old bookstore is profitable, with 5-10% year-on-year sales growth and mounting profits, it is still operating on thin enough margins that it is vulnerable to shocks, and now the store has lost its lease, a shock that has endangered the store's future.</p>
      <p>In an email to customers and stakeholders, owner Terry Gilman has offered the store for sale on a "turnkey" basis, seeking offers before November 20th. The store has 60 days to vacate its location and unless a new owner and location have been found by then, Southern California will lose one of its most storied, best independent bookstores, and science fiction and fantasy will lose one of its greatest, longest-standing genre bookstores.</p>
      <blockquote>The staff of Mysterious Galaxy just received notice that they are losing their lease for their Balboa Avenue storefront, and will need to move in 60 days. It is with heavy hearts that we share that unless a new buyer and new location are found immediately, Mysterious Galaxy will be forced to close its doors. <br/><br/>For nearly 27 years, Mysterious Galaxy Bookstore has been a vibrant part of the book community in San Diego, and a safe and welcoming place for those with a passion for books. The past several years have seen 5-10% growth in sales and increasing profits. The store's participation in regional and industry conventions, and its stellar in-store events, have earned it a special place in the hearts of authors and readers alike, and created a well-respected brand in Science Fiction, Fantasy, Horror, and Mystery praised throughout the publishing and bookselling industry. <br/><br/>The purchase of Mysterious Galaxy is expected to be a turn-key sale, retaining the staff and mission of Mysterious Galaxy to grow and expand the already established brand. We eagerly hope to find the right buyer, who will focus on the future success and growth of Mysterious Galaxy, and consider the best interests of its expert staff. <br/><br/>This is a growing and vibrant bookstore with a knowledgeable and enthusiastic staff, who hope Mysterious Galaxy will thrive for many years to come. They are seeking a passionate new owner who can act swiftly to save this community treasure, and destination for readers, authors, and publishers. <br/><br/>A note from the Staff <br/><br/>Over its 27-year tenure as San Diegoâ€™s premier destination for genre-fiction, Mysterious Galaxy has become a home for those who love the magical, the odd, the chilling, &amp; everything in between. We have found a family here, among each other and our wonderful readers, and we hope this store can continue to provide an inclusive place for anyone and everyone who wishes to pick up a new book, find an old favorite, or spend time among people who love books and the stories they contain. You can help us by getting the word out and sharing #savemysteriousgalaxy. <br/><br/>We'd love for you to be our 11th hour miracle! <br/><br/>For serious inquiries about purchasing the store, please contact current Mysterious Galaxy Store Owner Terry Gilman (Terry@mystgalaxy.com) by November 20. <br/><br/>For general questions and information about the sale of Mysterious Galaxy contact Store Manager Kelly Orazi at 858-268-4747 or Kelly@mystgalaxy.com</blockquote>
