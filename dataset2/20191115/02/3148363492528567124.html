      <h1>Rashida Tlaib Faces Expanded House Ethics Panel Review</h1>
      <h2>The House Ethics Committee on Thursday announced it has expanded its examination of possible campaign finance violations by Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI).</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T02:18:39+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 02:18</time> by <a rel="author">Joshua Caplan</a></address>
      <p>The committee released a series of eyebrow-raising messages in which the freshman congresswoman asks for congressional campaign money to help relieve her personal financial struggles.</p>
      <p>According to Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings, Tlaib paid herself $17,500 from her campaign bank account following her election in 2018. Lawmakers are prohibited from compensating themselves using campaign funds once they are elected.</p>
      <p>The panel stated:</p>
      <blockquote>The Committee notes that the mere fact of conducting further review of a referral, and any mandatory disclosure of such further review, does not itself indicate that any violation has occurred, or reflect any judgment on behalf of the Committee.</blockquote>
      <p>Communications published by the House Ethics panel show the Michigan Democrat reaching out to her staff members in search of money amid mounting personal debt.</p>
      <p>In August 2018, Tlaib sent a text message to Ryan Anderson, now her chief of staff, at 6:38 a.m. regarding her money problems.</p>
      <p>“Sorry for the early text but do you think the campaign can still pay me a stipend until the general. Trying to get out of debt,” she wrote.</p>
      <p>“I think we definitely afford to do so. But we need to really clearly define your time and space,” Anderson wrote back.</p>
      <p>In another note, Tlaib emailed Anderson that she was “not going to make it through the campaign without a stipend.”</p>
      <p>“With the loss of a second income to lean back on,” the far-left “Squad” member added:</p>
      <blockquote>I am requesting $2,000 per two weeks but not exceeding $12,000. The cost of living stipend is going towards much needed expenses due to campaigning that includes car maintenance, child care and other necessities. Please let me know if I can proceed.</blockquote>
      <p>The House Ethics Committee first <a href="https://apnews.com/a17e7767a55f4b8e9abaca16e8d4abda">revealed</a> it received a referral about possible violations by Tlaib in August of this year.</p>
      <p>The panel also said Thursday that it was reviewing allegations of a possible relationship between Rep. Alcee Hastings (D-FL) and a staff member and is looking into whether the congressman, who was once impeached for bribery and perjury as a judge, had “received any improper gifts, including any forbearance, from that employee.”</p>
