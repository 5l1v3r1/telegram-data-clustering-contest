      <p>INDORE: There's always pressure on R Ashwin to deliver, especially at home. He is India's strike bowler in these conditions and has been the protagonist in many Indian victories in the last few years.</p>
      <p>However, not often do Team India play on wickets that aid seamers. Ashwin, still managed to make his presence felt in conditions tailor made for pacers here at the Holkar Stadium. The tall off-spinner took two important wickets of Bangladesh skipper <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Mominul-Haque">Mominul Haque</a> and the experienced <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Mahmudullah">Mahmudullah</a> on the opening day. With more support from the fielders, especially vice-captain <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ajinkya-Rahane">Ajinkya Rahane</a>, he could have walked away with more wickets but he has no complaints.</p>

      <p>"It can happen. The same ground, last time when Ajinkya was standing at slip, he took so many catches off my bowling. You don't expect Ajinkya to put down catches. We are actually benchmarking him against his own standards, which happens a lot in our part of the world. I expect him to go in the second innings and take a lot of catches," he said.</p>
      <p>Ashwin showed his class, used variations extremely well and kept the Bangladesh batsmen guessing. He mixed side and traditional spin with aplomb to play a great supporting role.</p>

      <p>When asked whether he was consciously trying not to turn the ball, Ashwin said, "I bowled a few good balls that beat them. That's as simple as it could get. I haven't given as much thought as you guys. For me, it is all about trying to get the rhythm right and obviously mixing the pace up. Obviously, in the process, I thought the wicket has more bounce than many wickets in the country. If you look at Ranchi, it's chalk and cheese. It's probably one of the reasons why we were scoring at a fair clip. In India, the pitches are a little duller than this," he explained.</p>
      <p>It's very rare that Ashwin and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ravindra-jadeja">Ravindra Jadeja</a> take a back seat in India, but thanks to the red-hot form of the pacers, Ashwin is seen in a different role. "As a bowler, I personally never looked at it that way. It's my job to pick up a wicket and try and capitalize. If the pacers don't pick a wicket then get a breakthrough. It is not viewed generally how a bowler bowls in the middle. First try and understand the pace of the pitch, how to deliver, how to keep the game in check, how to build a spell. That's how we think about it," he said.</p>

      <p>Like everyone, he too has a word of praise for the trio of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ishant-sharma">Ishant Sharma</a>, Mohammad Shami and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/umesh-yadav">Umesh Yadav</a>. "They have been exceptional, especially if you look at Umesh over the last few years since 2016 when the home season happened, he has always given us an early breakthrough. Ishant has been splendid and Shami has probably been in the best rhythm of his entire career," Ashwin said.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes you feel that every spell they bowl, something is happening or they make it happen. I think Shami, Ishant and Umesh have been bowling well as a pack. If you add Bumrah to it over the last few months or a year in Test cricket, I think it's one of the most lethal pace attacks going around in the world if not the best," the 33-year-old said.</p>
