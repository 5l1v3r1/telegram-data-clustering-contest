      <h2>This year’s NHS winter crisis could be the worst ever - with figures already showing just 83.6% of A&amp;E patients were admitted within four hours last month, way below the ­target 95%</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T02:42:34+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 02:42</time> by <a rel="author">Louie Smith, Nicola Bartlett, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/nicola-bartlett/</a></address>
      <p>A leading doctor has warned patients’ lives are being put at risk by dangerously high A&amp;E waiting times, which are the worst on record.</p>
      <p>And with fears this year’s winter crisis could be the bleakest yet, medics are worried the NHS ­casualty system is “imploding”.</p>
      <p>Just 83.6% of A&amp;E patients were admitted within four hours last month, way below the ­recommended 95%. That target has not been met since July 2015, according to NHS statistics.</p>
      <p>Royal College of Emergency Medicine president Dr Katherine Henderson said: “A crowded department is an unsafe ­department.</p>
      <p>"We believe crowding in an emergency department has a direct effect on mortality.”</p>
      <p>Dr Nick Scriven of the Society of Acute Medicine added: “These figures are truly worrying as we haven’t even reached the ­‘traditional’ winter period yet.”</p>
      <p>Tory cuts have been blamed for the crisis, with staffing levels badly hit, leaving stretched doctors and nurses ­struggling to cope.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> branded the waiting time figures “disgraceful”.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>He said: “That’s one in five of everyone accessing an A&amp;E department hasn’t been seen within the required four hours. It is a problem of the lack of staff and the lack of funding for it.”</p>
      <p>And Nuffield Trust think-tank chief economist Professor John Appleby said he fears things will only get worse.</p>
      <p>He added: “These figures show the next government will immediately be faced with one of the bleakest winters in the NHS’s history.</p>
      <p>“If this trend keeps going, I fear we could see 100,000 people stuck on trolleys this coming January.”</p>
      <p>Shadow Health ­Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: “The Conservatives have ushered in the worst NHS crisis on record.</p>
      <p>“Under <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> the NHS is in crisis and we’re heading for a winter of abject misery for patients.</p>

      <p>“The Tories spent a decade cutting over 15,000 beds. Now they should apologise to every patient languishing on a trolley and waiting longer for treatment.”</p>
      <p>Emma Driver, whose dad Duncan died after falling off a trolley following a six-hour wait last month, told how she “relives that horrific moment every day”.</p>
      <p>She said: “There’s not a lot of people who will speak out but I’m not going to stand aside and let people think this is OK.”</p>
      <p>The 83.6% figure compares to 85.2% in September and 89.1% in October last year.</p>
      <p>It meant more than 80,000 patients were left waiting over four hours after doctors had decided they needed a bed. And more than 720 waited over 12 hours for a bed.</p>
      <p>The 85% target to start cancer ­treatment within 62 days of an urgent referral is also being missed. Just 76.9% of patients started therapy in September.</p>
      <p>The NHS deals with more than a million patients every 36 hours, and the total number waiting has now hit 4.4 million, a 5.7% rise on September last year.</p>

      <p>But the service has 100,000 vacancies, including a shortage of 40,000 nurses. A daily average of 4,979 beds were ­occupied by patients waiting for discharge in September 2019, the figures show.</p>
      <p>More than one in five of those delays was as a result of elderly and frail patients waiting for a care package to be set up at home.</p>
      <p>Social care is also in crisis thanks to Tory underfunding and savage cuts of £7billion.</p>
      <p>Dr Henderson said: “We are clear in emergency departments that we need to see a lot more money going into social care.”</p>
      <p>Since 2010, the NHS has endured the longest period of austerity in its history.</p>
      <p>Budgets rose by 1.5% a year between 2009/10 to 2018/19, compared to the 3.7% since the service started in 1948. But Health Secretary Matt Hancock faced ridicule when he claimed “in some ways the NHS is performing better than ever”.</p>
      <p>He blamed the increase in waiting times on a rise in demand.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for NHS England said: “These figures show that while NHS staff are looking after a markedly higher number of older and sicker patients, a higher number of patients are being seen quickly than a year ago.”</p>
