      <p>Aaron Carter has worried fans after he was hospitalised with worrying weight loss during a period of personal drama in his life.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old singer posted a photo on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> on Thursday which showed him lying in a hospital bed while hooked up to an IV.</p>
      <p>It would seem from the pic that he has suffered a reasonable amount of weight loss.</p>
      <p>Aaron geo-tagged the snap which indicated that he was at the Ascension Sacred Heart Emerald Coast, which is a medical centre in Destin, Florida.</p>
      <p>The singer, who lives in Southern California, captioned the post: "Mommas gonna take care of me."</p>
