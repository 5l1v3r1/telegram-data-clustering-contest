      <h1>2 Tech Stocks That Got Crushed on Thursday</h1>
      <h2>Tsk, tsk -- this pair of notable techies issued guidance investors didn't like.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T02:01:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 02:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fool.com/author/4067/" target="_blank">Eric Volkman (TMFVolkman)</a></address>
      <p>On paper, the <b>S&amp;P 500</b> notched a new all-time high on Thursday... although this came from only a marginal improvement on the index. Looking at the bigger picture, it was really just another flat day from the stock market. This has become a pattern this week.</p>
      <p>Even some of the frequently volatile <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/investing-in-tech-stocks.aspx">tech stocks</a> on the various exchanges didn't budge all that much in price. There weren't all that many outliers -- however, I've found two stocks in the sector that saw more lively action... albeit of the bearish variety. Here's a closer look at the pair.</p>

      <h3>Cisco Systems</h3>
      <p>Woe betide any major publicly traded company that trims its guidance. This applies particularly to tech stocks, since investors in the sector often expect ever-rising growth rates even from the most mature businesses.</p>
      <p>This is basically what happened on Thursday to long-established networking giant <b>Cisco Systems</b> (<a href="https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/cisco-systems/csco/">NASDAQ:CSCO</a>), whose stock closed more than 7% lower. The company released its Q1 of fiscal 2020 results; within them the company proffered guidance indicating a year-over-year sales slowdown of 3% to 5% for its current Q2.Â </p>
      <p>News of the anticipated decline overshadowed what wasn't a bad Q1 at all. Both revenue and <a href="https://www.fool.com/knowledge-center/your-guide-to-gaap.aspx">non-GAAP</a> (adjusted) net profit rose, by nearly 1% and 5%, respectively, to $13.2 billion and $3.6 billion. The latter figure worked out to $0.84 per share. Both headline numbers were a bit higher than the average analyst estimates.</p>
      <p>Although the anticipated Q2 sales slump won't necessarily be Cisco's fault -- the company accurately pointed out that many clients are reining in spending on networking equipment due to economic uncertainty -- it isn't helping investor sentiment.</p>
      <p>For the most part Cisco has done a good job over the years growing its top line, if not all that dynamically, and keeping its margins nice and high. It can be uncomfortable to be invested in such a stock during a down quarter.</p>
      <p>I'm a Cisco bull, as we're in an environment where the long-term need for reliable networking equipment is only <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/01/30/cisco-could-win-big-from-this-emerging-market.aspx">going to grow throughout the world</a>, especially in the enterprise segment. Yes, a dip in sales is a concern, but this is a bug and not a feature with Cisco. I'd consider buying the stock at a discount after Thursday's sell-off.</p>
      <h3>Weibo</h3>
      <p>A much steeper fall on the day was recorded by Chinese social network powerhouse <b>Weibo</b> (<a href="https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/weibo/wb/">NASDAQ:WB</a>), which saw a nearly 18% drop.</p>
      <p>Weibo's problem was much like Cisco's -- guidance. Along with its Q3 of fiscal 2019 results unveiled in the morning, Weibo served up a weak revenue outlook for its current frame.</p>
      <p>The trailing performance was Cisco-ish, in that Weibo demonstrated decent if unspectacular growth and lightly exceeded analyst projections. Q3's top line was 2% higher, clocking in at the equivalent of $468 million, although quite a bit of this growth was due to the consolidation of Yizhibo, a video streaming purveyor the company acquired in late 2018.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, adjusted net profit saw a 3% lift to just over $176 million ($0.77 per share).</p>
      <p>For the current Q4, however, Weibo anticipates only flat-to-3% growth in its revenue on a constant-currency basis. At this point it almost goes without saying that this basically lands below analyst estimates for the quarter. Again, no investor likes guidance that comes in under expectations -- and shareholders of tech stocks tend to be awfully growth-hungry.</p>
      <p>But there are other, quite justified, concerns here.</p>
      <p>Ad-sales-dependent <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/08/20/is-it-finally-time-to-buy-sina-and-weibo.aspx">Weibo has seen a marked decline in revenue growth</a> over only the last few quarters. And with the U.S.-China trade war and its effects on the Asian giant's economy -- which was looking relatively wobbly to begin with -- I can't imagine Chinese advertisers will suddenly and dramatically start opening their wallets again.</p>
      <p>A 17%-plus chop in share price is quite drastic, and I imagine Weibo will attract some bottom-feeders. But I think this company is in for more struggle, so even at this level I think it's best to stay away from its stock at the moment.</p>
