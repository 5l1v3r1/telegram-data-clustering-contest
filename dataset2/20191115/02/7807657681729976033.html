      <p>Recently, <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/minecraft-earth/home">Minecraft Earth</a> Early Access went live in the United Kingdom and the United States.

The goal is to build structures and explore a superimposed Minecraft world wherever you are.</p>
      <p>Many gamers didn't think that Minecraft Earth would see the popularity Minecraft enjoys on platforms like iOS. However, that doesn't appear to be the case. Today, Xbox's Aubrey Norris tweeted that Minecraft Earth was the most-downloaded app on the Apple App Store.
