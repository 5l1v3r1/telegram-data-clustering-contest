      <h1>Exclusive Preview: Excalibur #2</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T02:21:40+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 02:21</time> by <a rel="author">Blair Marnell</a></address>
      <p>The sword has been reforged in the Dawn of X, and a new Excalibur has come together in Krakoa. Unfortunately, the newly formed mutant nation has unintentionally started a magic war with Otherworld, and its ruler, Morgan le Fay. Captain Britain, a.k.a. Brian Braddock, has already fallen under le Fay’s control. However, Brian was able to pass his powers to his sister, Betsy, making the former Psylocke into the new Captain Britain.</p>
      <p>Back on Krakoa, Apocalypse’s attempt to reach Otherworld left Rogue in a precarious position. Somehow, Rogue has also been infected by Otherworld’s magic. Regardless of her own great powers, Rogue now sleeps like a fairy tale princess in suspended animation.</p>
      <p>In Superhero Hype’s exclusive preview for <b>Excalibur</b> #2, Tini Howard and artist Marcus To reflect on one of Apocalypse’s early mutant encounters. In the present, the new Captain Britain, Kate Pryde, Gambit, and Jubilee bring Rogue back to the Lighthouse. That mystical building was once Excalibur’s headquarters, and it may hold the key to freeing Rogue. Unfortunately, something else is lurking beneath the surface.</p>
