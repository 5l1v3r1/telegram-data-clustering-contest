      <p>Beshear, whose father, Steve, was the state’s last Democratic governor, scored a narrow victory on Nov. 5 despite an election-eve rally headlined by Trump, who remains popular among Republicans.</p>
      <p>After a recanvass of the vote showed no change in results, Bevin said at a news conference he would no longer contest the election. “I truly wish the attorney general well as the next governor of the state,” Bevin said.</p>
      <p>Beshear responded on Twitter: “It’s official - thank you Kentucky. @GovMattBevin and his team have already begun a smooth transition. It’s time to get to work!”</p>
