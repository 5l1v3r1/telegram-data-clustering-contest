      <p>After weeks of relationship rumors, it appears that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/search-results/foxnews.com/category/person/pete-davidson">Pete Davidson</a> and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kaia-gerber-birthday-leather-outfit-cindy-crawford">Kaia Gerber</a> are officially together.</p>
      <p>"They are definitely an item," a source told Fox News.</p>
      <p>The insider claimed that Gerber's mom, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/cindy-crawford-posing-nude-53-its-a-different-kind-of-beauty">supermodel Cindy Crawford</a>, just wants her 18-year-old daughter to "keep it low-key at this point in the relationship, especially with all the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/ariana-grande-and-pete-davidson-reportedly-call-off-their-engagement-end-romantic-relationship">Ariana Grande</a> [Davidson's ex-fiancee] stuff that has happened." The source also pointed to Davidson, 25, and Gerber's "age difference."</p>

      <p>"Kaia is having fun and this is all new to her, so of course she would want to see what a relationship with someone like Pete would be like," added the source. "So far, she’s having a blast."</p>

        </a>
      </p>
      <p>Over the weekend, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/pete-davidson-kaia-gerber-attend-podcast-event">Davidson and Gerber reportedly attended a podcast event</a>, and last week <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/pete-davidson-supermodel-kaia-gerber-appeared-very-happy-together-on-recent-dinner-date-report">they dined at the </a><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/pete-davidson-supermodel-kaia-gerber-appeared-very-happy-together-on-recent-dinner-date-report">swanky pizza spot, Pizzeria Mozza,</a> in Los Angeles, according to <a href="https://people.com/tv/pete-davidson-kaia-gerber-happy-together-on-date-source/">People</a>.</p>
      <p>In late October, Davidson -- who <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/pete-davidson-margaret-qualley-dating">recently split from actress Margaret Qualley</a>, 25, nearly a year after his brief engagement to Grande -- was <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/pete-davidson-leaving-kaia-gerber-apartment">spotted leaving Gerber‘s New York apartment</a> building, Page Six had reported.</p>
      <p>At the time, an insider told the outlet that Davidson was there to see Gerber but said the pair was “just friends.”</p>

      <p>Rumors of an official romance between Gerber and Davidson grew after Gerber accompanied her mother to the Women’s Guild Cedars-Sinai Annual Luncheon at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel last week while sporting a rose gold necklace <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/11/07/kaia-gerber-wears-p-necklace-amid-pete-davidson-dating-rumors/">with a “P” pendant charm</a>.</p>
