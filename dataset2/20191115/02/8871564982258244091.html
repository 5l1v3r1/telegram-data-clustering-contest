      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T02:18:35+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 02:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Hong%20Kong" target="_blank">Coconuts Hong Kong</a></address>
      <p>A 70-year-old man died in hospital last night, one day after he was <a href="https://coconuts.co/hongkong/news/2-in-critical-condition-following-clashes-in-new-territories/">hit in the head by a brick</a> during clashes between pro-Beijing supporters and anti-government protesters in Sheung Shui on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>RTHK reports that the man, a cleaner working for the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department, was taken to hospital in a critical condition.</p>
      <p>The Hospital Authority said that his condition had continued to deteriorate, and that he was <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/ch/component/k2/1492254-20191114.htm">declared dead at the Prince of Wales Hospital in Sha Tin 10pm on Wednesday night</a>.</p>
      <p>The FEHD also released a statement in the early hours of this morning expressing <a href="https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201911/15/P2019111500063.htm">“profound sadness”</a> at his passing, and adding that they were providing assistance to his family.</p>
      <p>The statement also said that the authorities “expresse[d] outrage over the malicious acts of the rioters.”</p>
      <p>The case will be referred to the coroner’s court to determine the cause of death.</p>
      <p>Speaking to reporters this afternoon, senior superintendent of police Chan Tin-chu from the crime unit of the New Territories North Regional Headquarters said that police believe he was filming the scene of the fight at the time when a masked man reportedly threw a hard object at him.</p>
      <p>He added that the case, which was initially treated as a wounding case, is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HongKongPoliceForce/videos/1247984522068217/">now being treated as a murder case</a>, and that no arrests have been made yet.</p>
