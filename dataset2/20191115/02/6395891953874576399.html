      <p><b>CINCINNATIÂ (AP)</b> - The Cincinnati Bearcats didn't exactly look polished with their leading scorer watching from the bench in street clothes, but their they still had more than enough against overmatched Alabama A&amp;M.</p>
      <p>Chris Vogt set season highs with 16 points and 10 rebounds and Cincinnati pulled away from the Bulldogs for an 85-53 win on Thursday without Jarron Cumberland, who was sidelined with what first-year Cincinnati coach John Branned called a "coach's decision."</p>
      <p>Trevon Scott scored 16 points, Jaevin Cumberland added 13 and Keith Williams finished with 11 for Cincinnati (2-1), which never trailed and led by as many as 33 points despite committing a season-high 18 turnovers.</p>
      <p>"It was a matter of different lineups - random lineups and people not playing together," Vogt said. "A lot of it was being careless with the ball."</p>
      <p>Thirteen of Cincinnati's turnovers were committed in the first half, which Brannen made sure to point out at halftime.</p>
      <p>"Obviously, tonight was a tale of two halves," said Brannen, who voiced his unhappiness with his team's first-half energy. "We're always excited to get a win. We had much better energy and took better care of the basketball in the second half. I told the guys we need to have the same tenacity."</p>
      <p>The win was the second straight for Cincinnati since a season-opening 64-56 loss at then-No. 18 Ohio State.</p>
      <p>Cameron Alford led Alabama A&amp;M (0-3) with 10 points.</p>
      <p>Jaevin Cumberland made his first start of the season in place of his cousin Jarron, last season's American Athletic Conference Player of the Year and this season's AAC pre-season Player of the Year. Brannen wouldn't say whether Cumberland would be benched for more than one game.</p>
      <p>"That's the great part of a coach's decision," he said. "You get to reevaluate it."</p>
      <p>"It was weird, but you've still got to play," Williams said.</p>
      <p>The 7-foot-1 Vogt's performance helped the Bearcats build an impressive 53-27 rebound advantage. He went 7-for-9 from the field.</p>
      <p>"The guys did a great job finding me tonight," said Vogt, who followed Brannen from Northern Kentucky.</p>
      <p>"I think Chris continues to do a great job solidifying his ability to score in the post," Brannen said. "You've got to have an inside presence in this league or any league."</p>
      <p>Cincinnati quickly took control with a 10-0 run that left the Bearcats leading 19-5 with 13:09 left in the first half. The Bulldogs didn't reach double figures until Brandon Miller's short jump shot gave them 11 points with 8:38 left before halftime.</p>
      <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
      <p>Alabama A&amp;M: Thursday's game was the third of a season-opening five straight on the road for the Bulldogs.</p>
      <p>Cincinnati: The Bearcats improved to 18-0 all-time against current Southwestern Athletic Conference teams in coach John Brannen's first game against a SWAC team.</p>
      <p>WELCOME HOME</p>
      <p>Alabama A&amp;M's starting lineup included freshman guard E.J Williams, a native of Middletown, Ohio, located about 25 miles north of Cincinnati.</p>
      <p>HELPING HAND</p>
      <p>Jaevin Cumberland's team-high six assists included an alert alley-oop pass to a wide-open Scott, who finished with a dunk that drew the night's loudest roar from the crowd of 9,830.</p>
      <p>RAISING THE BAR</p>
      <p>Vogt's points and Jaevin Cumberland's assists both were single-game season highs for Cincinnati.</p>
      <p>UP NEXT</p>
      <p>Alabama A&amp;M's Southwest Ohio tour is scheduled to continue with a noon game at Miami (Ohio) on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Cincinnati is off until its game against Illinois State on Friday in the first round of the Paradise Jam in the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>
