      <p>Earlier this month, OnePlus <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/oxygenos-10-0-5-rolls-out-for-the-oneplus-7t-while-open-beta-5-rolls-out-for-the-oneplus-7-7-pro/">rolled out OxygenOS 10.0.5</a> for the OnePlus 7T and Open Beta 5 for the OnePlus 7/7 Pro. While the stable rollout for the 7T didn’t include any new features, it did address an issue some users were facing with the double-tap to wake gesture. Now, OnePlus is rolling out another update for the 7T with more bug fixes, along with OxygenOS 10.0.4 for the OnePlus 7T Pro.</p>
