      <h1>Chelsea outcast Olivier Giroud eyed by Borussia Dortmund for January transfer</h1>
      <h2>Bundesliga giants to reignite interest as Inter Milan also keen on France striker, who is being kept out of Chelsea side by Tammy Abraham</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T02:07:16+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 02:07</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Lewis, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-lewis/</a></address>
      <p>Borussia Dortmund have joined the chase for Chelsea outcast Olivier Giroud.</p>
      <p>The German giants are ready to reignite their interest after being rejected by the France striker in the summer of last year.</p>
      <p>Inter Milan are already keen on the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> striker, 33, and the Blues want £5million.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/olivier-giroud">Giroud</a> has made only six appearances for Chelsea this season and wants to move on in search of regular first-team football.</p>
      <p>Although he is out of contract at the end of the season and available on a free, he wants to move in January in order to make the France squad for next summer’s European Championships.</p>

      <p>Giroud scored the winner for France from the penalty spot on Thursday night as Didier Deschamps' side came from a goal down to Moldova 2-1 and go top of their Euro 2020 qualifying group.</p>
      <p>Deschamps has previously appealed to Chelsea boss Frank Lampard for Giroud to be given more game time for his club.</p>
      <p>Giroud is being kept out of the team by England striker Tammy Abraham, who is the Premier League's second highest goalscorer this season with 10 strikes - one behind Leicester's Jamie Vardy.</p>
      <p>The French striker is also competing with Belgium's Michy Batshuayi, and Chelsea boss <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/frank-lampard-sends-olivier-giroud-20791127">Lampard says he cannot pick the team based on what international managers want</a> .</p>

      <p>Lampard said earlier this month: "It is difficult for me and it is difficult for them – we both have our jobs so it doesn’t feature in my thinking. I have care for all the players. I have to pick the squad as I see it for the best of Chelsea as they do for their countries.</p>
      <p>“I have got three strikers to pick from and I have to make the choices. Again I can’t complain about any of their attitudes.</p>
      <p>“Things will look different and that is where you need professionalism. Between those three I have had it from all of them.”</p>
      <p>France travel to Albania for their final qualifier on Sunday and will win Group H as long as they avoid defeat.</p>
