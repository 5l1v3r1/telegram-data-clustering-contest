      <h1>Grand Rapids Will Pay $190,000 to Veteran Detained by ICE</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T02:04:31+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 02:04</time> by <a rel="author">Sandra E. Garcia</a></address>
      <p>The City Commission in Grand Rapids, Mich., has agreed to pay a former Marine $190,000 after he was wrongfully detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement for three days last year.</p>
      <p>The former Marine, Jilmar Ramos-Gomez, 28, and the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan <a href="https://www.aclumich.org/en/press-releases/aclu-and-michigan-immigrant-rights-center-file-civil-rights-complaints-over-grand">filed complaints</a> in April over the Grand Rapids Police Department’s involvement in his ICE detention, saying that a police captain discriminated against him.</p>
      <p>The City Commission and Mr. Ramos-Gomez, who was born in Michigan, reached the settlement on Monday, which was Veterans Day.</p>
      <p>“We hope that as a community we can learn from his case, and that the City of Grand Rapids and its police department will adopt further policy changes and commit to systemic reforms to ensure that no one else has to suffer what Mr. Ramos-Gomez endured,” Miriam Aukerman, Mr. Ramos-Gomez’s lawyer and a senior lawyer at the A.C.L.U. of Michigan, said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The Grand Rapids City Commission did not admit any wrongdoing.</p>
      <p>“We are satisfied that the parties have been able to resolve this matter without court proceedings,” Anita Hitchcock, a lawyer for the city, said in a statement. “We hope that all parties can now move forward.”</p>
      <p>Officers from the Grand Rapids Police Department initially arrested Mr. Ramos-Gomez on Nov. 21, 2018, after he made his way to the helipad of the Spectrum Health Butterworth Hospital, according to a police report. He was not a patient at the hospital at the time, but was struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder, his lawyer said.</p>
      <p>Mr. Ramos-Gomez made the nightly news on the evening of his arrest. Capt. Curt VanderKooi of the Grand Rapids Police Department was watching the news and saw Mr. Ramos-Gomez’s face, according to Ms. Aukerman.</p>
      <p>Captain VanderKooi sent an email to an ICE officer asking the agency to “check the status” of Mr. Ramos-Gomez, according to emails obtained by the A.C.L.U. Soon after, Matthew Lopez, a deportation officer for ICE, visited Mr. Ramos-Gomez at the Kent County Jail, where he was being held.</p>
      <p>After an interview, the officer decided Mr. Ramos-Gomez should be detained by ICE after his release from the custody of the local authorities, Ms. Aukerman said.</p>
      <p>Officer Lopez then informed Captain VanderKooi that Mr. Ramos-Gomez was a foreign national who was in the United States illegally, and thanked Captain VanderKooi for the lead, according to emails obtained by the A.C.L.U. of Michigan.</p>
      <p>Captain VanderKooi forwarded that email to the detective who had been investigating Mr. Ramos-Gomez’s arrest at the hospital. The subject line of the email was “Spectrum Helicopter Pad Loco,” emails obtained by the A.C.L.U. show.</p>
      <p>“It is not clear what mad intent was involved in this breach of hospital security but here is the report,” Captain VanderKooi wrote in the email.</p>
      <p>On Dec. 14, after the local authorities released Mr. Ramos-Gomez, he was detained by ICE and taken to the Calhoun County Jail, Ms. Aukerman said.</p>
      <p>“Mr. Ramos claimed in verbal statements to be a foreign national illegally present in the United States,” ICE said in a statement Thursday. The A.C.L.U. disputed this and said that the agency had refused to release the interview.</p>
      <p>At the time of his initial arrest, Mr. Ramos-Gomez was carrying his passport. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gzBuaInZKE">Footage from a body camera</a> worn by one of his arresting officers, obtained by the A.C.L.U., shows a police officer holding Mr. Ramos-Gomez’s United States passport in his hands.</p>
      <p>In the video, one officer asks another if Mr. Ramos-Gomez had been identified and another answers, “His passport is down there,” before he lets out a chuckle.</p>
      <p>Mr. Ramos-Gomez’s mother, Maria Gomez, hired a lawyer who gave ICE documentation that her son was born in the United States. Mr. Ramos was released on Dec. 17.</p>
      <p>“That’s not right what they did to my son. They throw him like nothing, so they don’t care what he did for his country,” Ms. Gomez said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-djfTkUD6iA">at a news conference</a> in January. “He needs respect.”</p>
      <p>After Mr. Ramos-Gomez was released, an internal affairs investigation was conducted to look into Captain VanderKooi’s actions. The investigation resulted in his being suspended for several days for a “discourteous complaint,” according to Sgt. John Wittkowski, a Grand Rapids Police Department spokesman.</p>
      <p>Ms. Aukerman said that when the local authorities and ICE “have this kind of entanglement, you are going to see this racial profiling.”</p>
      <p>“The internal affairs investigation was complete and utter whitewash,” Ms. Aukerman said, adding that the captain was not adequately punished for his actions. “He was reprimanded for saying that Jilmar was loco.”</p>
