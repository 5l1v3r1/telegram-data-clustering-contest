      <h1>Steelers' JuJu Smith-Schuster, James Conner ruled out with injuries</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T02:59:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 02:59</time> by <a rel="author">Brooke Pryor</a></address>
      <p>CLEVELAND -- <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/pit/pittsburgh-steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> wide receiver <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3120348/juju-smith-schuster">JuJu Smith-Schuster</a> exited Thursday night's game against the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-browns">Cleveland Browns</a> in the second quarter after absorbing two helmet-to-helmet hits. Smith-Schuster was ruled out for the rest of the game with a concussion before halftime.</p>
      <p>Running back <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3045147/james-conner">James Conner</a>, who reinjured his shoulder in the second quarter, has also been ruled out, along with cornerback <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3051921/artie-burns">Artie Burns</a> (knee) and linebacker <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3126081/olasunkanmi-adeniyi">Ola Adeniyi</a> (concussion).</p>
      <p>Smith-Schuster caught a pass from <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116407/mason-rudolph">Mason Rudolph</a> over the middle and was immediately hit in the head by <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4035437/greedy-williams">Greedy Williams</a>. A split second later, he took another helmet-to-helmet hit by safety <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13264/morgan-burnett">Morgan Burnett</a>.</p>
      <p>Smith-Schuster dropped the pass and lay face-down and motionless for at least a minute. Trainers rushed out to evaluate him and a couple Browns players took a knee near him. A trainer carrying a backboard came out, but wasn't needed. Smith-Schuster, 22, was able to walk off on his own, albeit slowly, and went directly to the locker room.</p>
      <p>At the time of Smith-Schuster's injury, the Steelers were already without Conner, who reinjured his shoulder in the second quarter.</p>
      <p>Already struggling offensively, Pittsburgh sputtered even more without its top playmakers. Smith-Schuster had two catches for 21 yards -- including one 16-yard gain -- when he went out, and Conner had five carries for 10 yards.</p>
