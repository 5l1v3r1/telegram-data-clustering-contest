      <p>HONOLULU, Hawaii (HawaiiNewsNow) - The federal government has paid out nearly $700,000 in legal expenses for the Kealohas and one of their co-defendants.</p>
      <p>The fees and costs were detailed in a report from the federal court Thursday.</p>
      <p>It shows that before Katherine Kealoha fired her, attorney Cynthia Kagiwada was paid $206,444 in fees.</p>
      <p>The federal government also paid fees to Kagiwada’s associate, a paralegal and other expenses for a total of $408,938 in costs for Katherine Kealoha.</p>
      <p>Louis Kealoha’s attorney Rustam Barbee collected $251,197 in fees and costs and the defense of officer Minh-Hung “Bobby” Nguyen cost $36,935.</p>
      <p>The federal judge found that the Kealohas and Nguyen could not afford to mount an effective defense so taxpayers must pay.</p>
      <p>These costs were only up until Nov. 5, and will continue to add up through sentencing in March.</p>
