      <p>Gulf soccer may be giving Bob Dylan’s 1964 hit, ‘The Times They Are a-Changin,’ a new lease on life.</p>
      <p><a href="http://tracking.jmdonline.org/tracking/click?d=75xzicT4b07KqskszqJAsbB3z5KJUFLGSLdcCl-X_MSL_TxkC1LudTm4gcW_fVw2xJT07DunlzxxshqzJY9qbRMhxpRqXD-3lpEsohpbcEXf5PbXQ0ceQuHwJdidZVTlD9iFfz7bC4KffKZOarwSNaU3QPxtMvEM_wDjdQxioFkoAOtRdjWnYC2hcPzfPpJP6X_CxIox989k5vufscHd9i9GzFfmkFAL5r4PPgi9rrqL0">Qatar surrendered its Arabian Gulf Cup hosting rights to Kuwait two years ago</a>, months into the United Arab Emirates-Saudi-led diplomatic and economic boycott of the Gulf state, after the boycotting countries said they would not participate in a Doha-hosted tournament.</p>
      <p>The boycott remains in place more than two years later, but this time round squads from the boycotting countries, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain, have <a href="http://tracking.jmdonline.org/tracking/click?d=gJCCExYaVT0w5R_Co9p9y41ti7sun3RuAjZsb1MNdpjBIcPaX7lDnN1PFE0r1Gc1dkEPevzWZ2u_bmsKPC6J0LjH9xBp1vDsUD-EM23e870weDCpW6PXBa1h2Rxo50_j0cC07K18Ds9qz7IMe1VyuWM1">no problem competing in this year’s Gulf Cup in Qatar.</a></p>
      <p>The decision not to boycott is the latest indication that Gulf states may be gradually moving to a reduction of tensions that have divided the region’s conservative energy-rich monarchies, raised the stakes in the rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and sparked a devastating Saudi-UAE military intervention in Yemen’s civil war.</p>
      <p>The decision also bodes well for Qatar’s hosting of the 2022 World Cup irrespective of whether Gulf states can resolve their differences before that tournament kicks off.</p>
      <p>If Mr. Dylan’s changing times portend well on the region’s monarchical soccer pitches, they could prove more divisive on its republican fields.</p>
      <p>Iraqi anti-government activists hope that this week’s World Cup qualifier between Iran and Iraq will blow new life into mass protests that <a href="http://tracking.jmdonline.org/tracking/click?d=UIDgwCFAAuxOwMJMLmhJG5Kb-_yiw8gGaNTovi4WV57AKux3f422o-K9zpiaaVwWUmlM2nSMpbSQAIPVcyqodIV_zUZtGxu7heeuiCIEu_VF6kdkLitWcjvuRwQBXTLIdlT_izKFvMPY31biafiqfep0p0rHpbP1pH9hYsQX_HPnZmanrt1x9wnsLtftEr_pQ-0IpS4RfuMwSqchztqJ8WovLytjyuHvhMMt1z-B_paLMyPaLx_Un6tAZXWs69W2Vw2">denounced Iranian influence in their country</a> and the government’s perceived prioritization of Iranian over Iraqi interests.</p>
      <p>Protesters blamed Iran and its Iraqi proxies for the harsh response by security forces that has <a href="http://tracking.jmdonline.org/tracking/click?d=syLW9-smv33U4tlGjwpGN0vsgC7or9f79gTzYe9h-8TDgLkNTNXoutCzHZ6uQSaFAE1oPRw9Iy0YKMy7xWhQIxbflnthTcOeC-nCk9EZoDkJZ8LfvjyYKW-h-9_jfYzSOrItR8QJp_YuK2-I38_-eqZMBlij9yxvTpHmhi_v-RXJvI8Kbi25bbwpLatvkzacqx9CZOlPMUMNTSPxb3WOuiI1">cost the lives of more than 300 people.</a></p>
      <p>The protests persuaded world soccer body FIFA to move the match from the southern Iraqi port city of Basra to the Jordanian capital Amman.</p>
      <p>“If our team beats Iran, <a href="http://tracking.jmdonline.org/tracking/click?d=o12T2DjMZag-wFpxJdNDraZ7ikQ7Y4U_RwYc4QCanz_SVioAcPGXAvkakEruYNwQZUo50PVym4t1I-GNTJMRAVYovOlvLpQTNboI-eNppF5pK0f80kaycs2xutp_I2EVRxWQnWhPd3CXc7r8e49N8xQErD1uXtXMO2OhTHEeH-z6cegbHua0UjOQ8OmMmTRDUYBykUxRmG5xWIZOuio-Yt01">it will bring more people out onto the streets</a> and lift protesters’ spirits,” said soccer fan Hussein Diaa as he kicked a ball on Baghdad’s Tahrir Square, a focal point of the protests.</p>
      <p>One indication of the degree to which a thaw in relations between Gulf monarchies may be on the horizon, is likely to be the way the squads of the boycotting nations handle themselves during the Gulf Cup.</p>
      <p>The Saudi and Emirati teams <a href="http://tracking.jmdonline.org/tracking/click?d=sUKCEe0J67-pgPIl8GLcfh9-fanpSsSwvxsWBmJ7CocL1zJ53G1AKKMEkaq82RulGpIwc1et5yx4wF4wNkt_tZic5AbKg-uQGp6Rqeg80cxTy3En-a18JDD0nOlYD5TFAQm4OcKpd_3otTik1mDlDUU7hzZppt0gP4zg1CSmBHVEQ1KHN4xamFSGbpPHJcWCSCflem8oro6ttfSTzEqt_px4fwJORDITBDAYOBUc3_8D7d3_6Elo6WwZmo8PD-tgLBkbj-H_sWFPwquV04hsTNE1">refused to participate in a news conference in Kuwait</a> two years ago because one of the microphones in front of them belonged to BeIN, the Qatari sports television network.</p>
      <p><a href="http://tracking.jmdonline.org/tracking/click?d=3hJKpVXoHZxIye4qqhw1Ucz7RUxkOK10uNZ-hsBykFJqmgcP6DAFavg5yl_LPAdnn722WYkg9QU8vDNOINHeO5RzWTm7seAVwfE1lXjkoEaNmI0tCR_N9aCFINwXIKefPLDGIMXkHpFVP8UtDXpdU5de7gaUG2qIuQcX4CmmKXXr1q50u7OqI0zaDHJJ_xxZgmRt2lyrLjHJSoe4bLgx6Vw1">Pro-Qatari</a> and Spanish media reported at the time that Saudi Arabia had offered Bahraini players bonuses if they “defeated the (Qatari) terrorists”.</p>
      <p>The boycotting countries accuse Qatar of supporting militants and political violence, a charge Qatar has consistently denied. They also demanded that Qatar distance itself from Iran, with whom it shares the world’s largest natural gas field.</p>
      <p>The decision to participate in the Qatari tournament came days after UAE minister of state for foreign affairs Anwar Gargash called for a diplomatic resolution to the dispute with the Islamic republic, suggesting that “<a href="http://tracking.jmdonline.org/tracking/click?d=pSUyEABlVoZpIiQyS1yoe5wpqhDME1XWgSeAAONml2yg1c5SqxpQX1J52OGyrnwP8PLgibPNpxMHE9BXrAbgvJdG6Dj1YbWl0d4vhZJx9C7uC2nS2-spLPli0wfFE8dJCATZtyA8WprOzCFF65cSaKbNkMNhvUUzOkXyH6FCWWzVeXTPm_XiNNlVn-FE8K-LYj0_xixB6HyMIO1edQSH1jiC4xRlYDMfu0KUDj95Yuqe0">there could be a path to a deal with Iran</a> that all parties might soon be ready to embark on.”</p>
      <p>Mr. Gargash’s remarks followed moves by the UAE to dial down tension in its relations with Iran that included reducing the UAE’s military role in Yemen and <a href="http://tracking.jmdonline.org/tracking/click?d=QRqD99shbwiF2h5B8M1CazjkW-hZdfmhEqN28NDTGLpXHWB-w_cY9D879nWoGX8dB87RIb6QJWMKn5EC78zElZA_Zc1X8I6gWTrlpWVyy-M_1xHQVWduBECEZillPTHXVPpLm5sRaZrcrLkB9hqS6W6HpgkyGC_l102xobMDUu1l0">visits to Iran by UAE officials</a> to discuss the regional dispute as well as maritime security.</p>
      <p>Similarly, a Saudi official, in a rare gesture, told reporters in Washington earlier this month that Qatar had <a href="http://tracking.jmdonline.org/tracking/click?d=WfuGI7mEWpHJxFT4sPE-Qivfhxh0Bkomr-VaTmYDMTuQz_le3nGFNJkjoGqsOw0wtGygQHMSXRQNcDAexIAals1DMuA_a_n2rurIy13dsF1ROhQm8l5A6MO8cIsFj5253Hs9w0Z0JJ81tJYafDfVDQ5MavWIcC4BqJSz2Mj1x4zzdqTyfvmfSFozi7CpP8X998-BEIYdP0Hw8n1x_G18P2Av-R5TnCwnlZk1etStnQ7V0">taken a step towards resolving the crisis</a> by passing an anti-terrorism funding law, a key demand of the boycotting countries, but needed to do more.</p>
      <p>Saudi Arabia, in a further indication that regional players were seeking to ensure that tensions don’t spin out of control, has scaled back its military operations in the 4.5-year long Yemen war after Iranian-backed Houthi rebels stopped firing ballistic missiles into the kingdom, the official added.</p>
      <p>Resolving the Gulf’s monarchical spat may prove easier than addressing differences with Iran over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and its support for militants in Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen.</p>
      <p>The spat has endured for the past 2.5 years because feuding parties appeared unwilling to back away from maximalist positions and search for what would amount to a face-saving formula that would allow for a restoration of diplomatic and economic relations.</p>
      <p>If the Gulf Cup is anything to go by, that may be changing.</p>
      <p>By the same token, this week’s Iraqi-Iranian soccer clash is likely to highlight the greater complexity involved in managing the Saudi-Iranian rift and the who-blinks-first problem against the backdrop of the US withdrawal from the 2015 international agreement that curbed Iran’s nuclear program and harsh economic sanctions since imposed by the United States.</p>
      <p>Iran has in recent months progressively reduced its adherence to the agreement in a bid to heighten tension to the point that it forces a breaking of the stalemate; pressure the accord’s other signatories, the European Union, China and Russia to provide the sanctions relief Iran needs; and force the Trump administration to return to the accord before it is renegotiated.</p>
      <p>Ironically, Gulf states that have gone to great length over the past decade to pre-empt popular revolts or limit, if not reverse their achievements, see a silver lining in the mass anti-government protests in Iraq and Lebanon because they target the foundations of Iranian influence in those two countries.</p>
      <p>As a result, Gulf rulers may be rooting for Iraq in this week’s soccer match against Iran, and not just because Iraq is predominantly Arab, and Iran is not.</p>
      <p>Yet, unlike the Gulf Cup that could prove to be an initial node in resolving a debilitating dispute, the Iran-Iraq World Cup qualifier’s possible heightening of tensions risks reaffirming the Marxist principle that things have to get worse before they get better.</p>
      <p>Indeed, ‘the times they are a changin,’ but reaping the benefits could prove to be a torturous process.</p>
