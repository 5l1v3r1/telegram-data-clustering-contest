      <p>Italy manager Roberto Mancini expressed humility after beating a national record that has stood for 80 years.</p>
      <p>A clinical 3-0 Euro 2020 qualifying victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina was the Azzurri’s ninth in a row in the campaign, and 10th in succession overall.</p>
      <p>It means Mancini has now surpassed the mark set by World Cup winner Vittorio Pozzo between 1938 and 1939.</p>
      <p>Despite the new record, Mancini knows it counts for little given the ultimate goal is success in next summer’s finals.</p>
      <p>“I’m happy with the record,” said Mancini in a post-match press conference. “To go above a legend like Pozzo means a lot but the road is still long.”</p>
      <p>Goals from Francesco Acerbi, Lorenzo Insigne and Andrea Belotti comfortably dispatched the hosts in Zenica to maintain Italy’s 100 per cent record at the top of Group J.</p>
      <p>It is all a far cry from two years ago when Italy failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes results arrive that you don’t even deserve, but you have to accept it,” added Mancini. “That’s football, unfortunately.</p>
      <p>“We’ve implemented a different way of working, in technical terms also. The guys have done very well and it’s paid off.”</p>
      <p>Belotti, who scored a sweetly struck third seven minutes after the break to snuff out any hope of a second-half revival from Bosnia, hailed the impact of Mancini since his arrival 18 months ago.</p>
      <p>The Torino striker said: “Mancini has done a great job. He has given us clear ideas in a short period of time.”</p>
      <p>Lazio defender Acerbi, whose opening goal in the 21st minute was his first for his country, feels Italy can build on what they have so far achieved.</p>
      <p>“I’m happy with my first goal for Italy,” said Acerbi.</p>
      <p>“It was not easy because Bosnia had nothing to lose and they tried to attack but we controlled the game well and we deserved this victory.</p>
      <p>“We have had a very good qualifying campaign, and I’m sure that these victories will help us to win more.”</p>
      <p>As for Bosnia, they must now rely on the backdoor route to the finals via the play-offs.</p>
      <p>Midfielder Miralem Pjanic, who plays for Juventus, feels his side have not done themselves justice this qualifying campaign.</p>
      <p>He said: “Italy are a good team and deserved the victory.</p>
      <p>“We should have done better in this group. We had the chance to qualify but we didn’t deserve to because we haven’t played to our potential in all the games.”</p>
