      <p>Federal prosecutors investigating Jeffrey Epstein’s death in a lower Manhattan lockup offered plea deals to two correctional officers who were <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/09/05/jail-where-jeffrey-epstein-died-has-egregious-history-of-security-breaches/">guarding the pedophile</a>, but the officers declined the deal, sources familiar with the probe told The Associated Press.</p>
      <p>News of any plea deal talks suggests prosecutors are mulling bringing federal charges against officers at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, where the multi-millionaire hanged himself in August.</p>
      <p>The guards are accused of failing to check on Epstein in his cell every half hour, as they were required to do, and falsifying reports to cover up their failure to do so.</p>
      <p>As part of the deal, authorities wanted the correction officers to admit they’d doctored the reports, The AP reported.</p>
      <p>After his death, as many as 20 correctional officers were slapped with <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/08/22/20-jail-workers-subpoenaed-in-jeffrey-epstein-suicide-probe/">grand-jury subpoenas</a>, CNN reported at the time.</p>
      <p>Among the jailers called were lieutenants who were in charge of the federal lockup the night Epstein killed himself.</p>
      <p>The 66-year-old financier’s death has been <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/30/famed-pathologist-michael-baden-says-jeffrey-epsteins-death-was-homicide/">ruled a suicide by hanging</a> by city officials.</p>
