        <b>A California doctor who served as a local NBC News correspondent was arrested Wednesday morning after an investigation found he attempted to solicit sexual texts from a 9-year-old girl.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Dr. Bruce Hensel, 71, is <a href="http://da.co.la.ca.us/media/news/man-charged-soliciting-sexual-pictures-young-girl">accused</a> of exchanging inappropriate messages with and requesting sexually suggestive photos from the girl, who was reportedly an acquaintance’s daughter.</p>
      <p><a href="https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2019/11/13/dr-bruce-hensel-nbc-arrested-girl/">CBS Los Angeles</a> reports the incident happened in August, and that the LAPD served a search warrant on Hensel’s home last month.</p>
      <p>A neighbor of Hensel’s interviewed by CBS LA claimed she heard the doctor would frequently vacation in Thailand, a south-Asia-Pacific nation known for a high rate of human and child sex trafficking.</p>

      <p>“If convicted as charged, Hensel faces a possible maximum sentence of 18 months in state prison,” reports <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ex-tv-medical-correspondent-charged-with-asking-9-year-old-girl-for-racy-photos/">CBS News</a>.</p>
      <p>In addition to serving as a KNBC Los Angeles medical correspondent for nearly 20 years, Hensel was also “friends” with Congressman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who’s taken center stage as the impeachment case against President Trump unfolds.</p>
      <p>In a video surfacing on social media, Schiff introduces Hensel as his “friend” at an event.</p>

      <p>“It gives me great pleasure to introduce our moderator this evening, a wonderful doctor and a very brave moderator and that is my friend Dr. Bruce Hensel,” Schiff says.</p>
      <p>“He is board certified in two specialties… and is a full time professor of medicine at UCLA,” Schiff says. “I don’t know how you find time to do all this.”</p>
      <p>It’s unclear what the extent of Schiff’s friendship with Hensel is, but Congressman Schiff also has ties to another accused sexual deviant who was recently jailed, Democrat megadonor Ed Buck.</p>
      <p>Buck was arrested and charged in September with operating a drug house after a third person suffered a non-fatal overdose at his West Hollywood home.</p>
      <p>In addition to <a href="https://truepundit.com/clinton-whistleblower-feds-probe-adam-schiff-dressed-like-egyptian-at-bizarre-sacrafice-parties-at-ed-bucks-meth-mansion/">visiting his home for at least two bizarre parties</a>, Schiff is one of a slew of prominent Democrat politicians to whom Buck had frequently donated.</p>
