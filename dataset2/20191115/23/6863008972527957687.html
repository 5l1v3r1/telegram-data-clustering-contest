      <p>The parties are now agreeing on the place and time of transfer of the three boats, the source said.</p>
      <p>The issue should be resolved before the Normandy Four summit, which is scheduled for December 9.</p>

      <p>According to them, Russia and Ukraine are now at the final stage of negotiations involving law enforcement agencies and foreign ministries of the two countries.</p>
      <p>Sources say the vessels will be towed to the sea where they are supposed to be met by Ukrainian tugs at a designated location.</p>
