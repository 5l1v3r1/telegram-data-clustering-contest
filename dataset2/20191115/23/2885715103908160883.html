      <p>THE ROAD connecting Uday Baug, Sopan Baug and BT Kawde Road continues to be blocked for the 10th day after the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) demolished a slum here on November 5.</p>
      <p>Residents of societies in the area recently held a meeting and formed the Sopan Baug Residents Association.</p>
      <p>The members said the slum dwellers had returned to the area and had blocked the road on both sides, following which they wrote a letter to the municipal commissioner and the Wanowrie police station, demanding action. They added that the slum dwellers had pitched tents and were going about their daily business.</p>
      <p>Sachin Khandelwal, a member of the association, said, “The slum dwellers aren’t allowing people to cross. This road connects Empress Garden lane to Uday Baug and BT Kawde road. Residents are forced to take a longer route.”</p>
      <p>“A lead engineer went and visited the site. It seems like after the litigation between the landowner and the slum dwellers, and the verdict of the court, the slum dwellers have blocked the area. The ward office is taking action in this case. It is not the main roads department that is handling this issue,” said Annirudha Pawaskar, head of the roads department of the PMC.</p>
