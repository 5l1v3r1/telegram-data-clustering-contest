      <h1>Billy Tucci Returns to Shi For New Graphic Novel</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T23:11:54+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 23:11</time> by <a rel="author">Noah Dominguez</a></address>
      <p>Comic book writer/artist Billy Tucci is returning to his creator-owned title <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/shi/">Shi</a> for a brand-new graphic novel. <i>Shi: Return of the Warrior</i> marks the titular character's first full-length adventure in 15 years.</p>
      <p>Last night -- Thursday, Nov. 14 -- Tucci launched a dual crowdfunding campaign to secure funding for the new 48-page graphic novel. At the time of writing, the comic has already made just over $28,900 on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1891522321/shi-return-of-the-warrior?ref=26njym&amp;token=2c6bba0e">Kickstarter</a> (over 280 percent of its $10,000 goal) and just over $11,800 on <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/shi-return-of-the-warrior#/">Indiegogo</a> (about 118 percent of its $10,000 goal) for a grand total of over $40,000 -- double the total goal. What's more, the two campaigns still have a ways to go, with both scheduled to end on Dec. 6.</p>

      <p><i>Return of the Warrior</i> follows an older Ana Ishikawa, who has walked from her life as Shi to raise her daughter, Hotaru. "I love the idea of a comic book character that grows up as time progresses," said Tucci. "Ours story opens with single mother Ana Ishikawa, now in her 40s, with her warrior days far behind her, living a peaceful existence and raising her teenage daughter Hotaru."</p>

      <p>However, the peace Ana and Hotaru enjoy is interrupted with the arrival a character dubbed "Dr. You" (their real name will be revealed when a special crowdfunding pledge level is met.) Dr. You informs Ana that Masahiro Arashi -- her old adversary -- has escaped from a New York mental institution and regressed into a younger, more violent version of himself -- one who is bent on revenge.</p>
      <p>When a new spree of gruesome killings begins in Manhattan -- one that mirrors the original Shi killings of 25 years prior -- Ana and Dr. You must put an end Masahiro's reign of terror before it finds its way to Hotaru.</p>
      <p>Tucci is joined on <i>Return of the Warrior</i> by co-writer Steven Peros and co-artist Ricardo Silva. Colorist Brian Miller, designer/letterer Mindy Lopkin and editor J.C. Vaughn have been enlisted as well. Furthermore, the graphic novel will feature a slew of different covers.</p>
      <p>One cover is provided by none other than <i>Harley Quinn</i>'s Amanda Conner. Up-and-comers Conny Valentina and Mike Renzine also have a cover. Of course, Tucci himself will provide a cover as well. Finally, legendary <i>Teen Titans</i> and <i>Infinity Gauntlet</i> artist George Pérez has come out of retirement to provide a cover for <i>Return of the Warrior</i>, which will seemingly be his last.</p>

      <p>"It’s amazing to have Amanda back at Crusade and it’s beyond incredible to have a post-retirement cover from George, too," said Tucci. "And it’s a true privilege to make the comics world aware of such rising talents as Conny and Mike on our variant covers."</p>

      <p>The character of Shi first burst onto the scene 25 years ago, making her first appearance in 1994's<i> Shi: The Way of the Warrior</i> #1.
