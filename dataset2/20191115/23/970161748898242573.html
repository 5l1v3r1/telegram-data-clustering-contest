      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/lionel-messi/">Lionel Messi</a> was caught telling Brazil coach Tite to stay quiet during Argentina’s win over <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/brazil-national-team/">Brazil</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/argentina-national-team/">Argentina</a> beat Brazil 1-0 in Saudi Arabia thanks to Messi’s first-half goal and Gabriel Jesus’ horror miss from the penalty spot.</p>
      <p>The game had several flashpoints with two penalties awarded and Tite was furious Messi did not receive a yellow card at one point in the match.</p>
      <p>It was Messi’s first appearance for Argentina <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/03/lionel-messi-banned-international-football-three-months-claiming-copa-america-corrupt-10510693/">since serving a three-month ban for saying the Copa America was ‘fixed for Brazil’</a> and the Barcelona superstar was clearly fed up with Tite’s complaints from the sidelines.</p>

      <p>TV cameras caught Messi telling Tite to pipe down and the Brazil coach insisted Argentina’s talisman told him to ‘shut up’.</p>
      <p>‘I only complained because he should have been booked and he told me to shut up, so I told him to shut up,’ he said. ‘It’s over now.</p>
      <p>‘I don’t want to answer anymore on it. You need a strong referee.’</p>
      <p>He added: ‘It should have been a card, I was right to complain.’</p>
      <p>Referee Matthew Conger was in charge for the game and awarded a penalty for Brazil when Jesus was tripped by German Pezzella in the box.</p>

      <p>Manchester City’s Jesus stepped up to take the penalty, but shot well wide of the mark.</p>
      <p>Tite was also unhappy with the penalty Argentina received a few minutes later, suggesting Alex Sandro’s challenge on Messi was a fair one.</p>
      <p>Liverpool stopper Alisson saved Messi’s effort, but couldn’t keep out his rebound as Brazil’s winless run stretched to five games.</p>
