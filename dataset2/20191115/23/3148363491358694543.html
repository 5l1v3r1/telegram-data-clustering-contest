      <p>While mimicking someone smacking their forehead, Roberts said, “I don’t know how much political damage that tweet is going to do, Neil, but certainly I think there was a lot of damage here at the White House to a collective group of foreheads as people went like this as the President tweeted that outright in the middle of the hearing. If anything, what it did was it really took the Republicans off of the message that they were trying to put out there and took this hearing in an entirely different direction than it had been before.”</p>
      <p>He added, “To send out that tweet in the middle of a hearing gave Adam Schiff, the Intelligence Committee Chairman, a perfect opportunity to say, ‘Hmm, maybe we should consider an article of impeachment here on witness intimidation.'”</p>
