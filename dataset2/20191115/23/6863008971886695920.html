      <p>Kyiv-based Raiffeisen Bank Aval, Ukraine's largest bank with foreign capital in terms of assets, will pay UAH 5 million (US$206,271) in bail for its Board Chairman Oleksandr Pysaruk by decision of the High Anti-Corruption Court in the case of theft of a refinancing loan issued to VAB Bank.</p>
      <p>"Raiffeisen Bank Aval informs that it will immediately take corresponding measures to provide the required bail according to the Court's decision," the bank's press service said on November 15.</p>
      <p>At the same time, Pysaruk will continue his work as Chairman of the Board of Raiffeisen Bank Aval, it said.</p>
      <p>"We are confident that Mr. Pysaruk will be cleared of any suspicion of wrongdoing and that he has always adhered to the highest professional and ethical standards, both at <a href="https://www.unian.info/economics/10752825-business-community-concerned-about-recent-events-around-chairman-of-raiffeisen-bank-aval-board.html">Raiffeisen </a>Bank Aval and for many years at the IMF and other international institutions," Martin Gr√ºll, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Raiffeisen Bank Aval, added.</p>
      <p>As UNIAN reported earlier, the High Anti-Corruption Court of Ukraine, within the case of VAB Bank refinancing theft, set a UAH 5 million bail for Pysaruk, who served as first deputy governor of the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) during VAB Bank's bankruptcy.</p>
      <p>The National Anti-corruption Bureau of Ukraine accused Pysaruk of conspiracy with VAB Bank owners when issuing a stabilization loan to the bank. However, the defense says the prosecution is based on value judgments.</p>
