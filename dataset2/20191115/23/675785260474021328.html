      <h2>The Notorious will put Fury through his paces 'soon' as The Gypsy King plans switch into MMA once his boxing career is over</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T23:47:23+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 23:47</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Tyson Fury has confirmed his plans to be trained by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/conor-mcgregor">Conor McGregor</a> ahead of a future switch into UFC.</p>
      <p>However, Fury is putting his MMA switch on hold until after he hangs up his boxing gloves, with a rematch against WBC heavyweight champion <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/deontay-wilder">Deontay Wilder</a> on the cards in February.</p>
      <p>Lineal heavyweight champion <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tyson-fury">Fury</a> certainly seems to have been planning for a career after boxing recently, having marked his WWE debut by beating Braun Strowman before making an appearance on Smackdown in his home city of Manchester.</p>
      <p>The Gypsy King then teased a potential transition into mixed martial arts by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/other-sports/mma/tyson-fury-trains-ufc-star-20848333">training with British UFC fighter Darren Till</a> .</p>
      <p>Now Fury has confirmed that former two-weight UFC champion McGregor has offered to train him in the near future.</p>

      <p>"I think Conor is an absolutely fantastic fighting man," Fury told RTE Radio 1. "He has offered to train me if I ever want to go into MMA.</p>
      <p>“What better trainer could I have than the Notorious Conor McGregor?”</p>
      <p>Fury added: "I’m looking forward to coming to train with Conor. We’re going to get it all planned in and I should be over in Dublin quite soon.</p>
      <p>"I’ll definitely be coming over for a training session, that is for sure.</p>

      <p>“I have been MMA training in the last week with Darren Till in Liverpool. I really enjoy the new challenge."</p>
      <p>Fury has called out heavyweight champion Stipe Miocic as well as Francis Ngannou.</p>
      <p>And on the subject of when he will make the switch from boxing to MMA, Fury said: "I don’t know where or when because after I finish my boxing career I fancy my hand at MMA as well."</p>
      <p>Fury is expected to fight Wilder for the WBC belt on February 22 - but first the American has to come through his rematch with Luis Ortiz on November 23.</p>
      <p>The Gypsy King has said if Wilder loses to Ortiz, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/boxing/tyson-fury-outlines-three-fight-20887643">he will target the winner of Anthony Joshua's rematch with Andy Ruiz Jr</a> for the WBA Super, IBF and WBO belts on December 7.</p>
      <p>Fury and Wilder fought out a split decision when they met in December last year.</p>
