      <p>I’m a Celebrity’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/nadine-coyle/">Nadine Coyle</a> made sure she left for the jungle on a high note after being crowned champion in Children In Need’s Celebrity Special.</p>
      <p>The Girls Aloud star raised £10,000 for the annual charity drive in the BBC quiz where her music knowledge was put to the test in a series of challenges.</p>
      <p>Joined by Heidi Range from Sugababez, the pair were able to take home the Pudsey special trophy all in the name of a good course.</p>
      <p>Speaking after her win, Nadine joked: ‘He can travel; we’re not that far from each other.’</p>
      <p>Seems like that little yellow bear is about to clock up some serious air miles, considering Nadine is now heading onto I’m a Celeb!</p>
      <p>‘We were not confident at all, especially standing next to Antony who was really geared up for it and he knew so many answers,’ Heidi said. ‘We came in going “oh we’ll be out after the first round” so we’re over the moon!’</p>

      <p>Nadine added: ‘I really think this was a huge team effort, also on this team but then there were the other teams that really helped and then the audience really, really helped!’</p>

      <p>This year’s Children in Need has seen celebs go the extra mile in the name of charity, raising millions to help those less fortunate and fundraising for important facilities that aid less fortunate children.</p>
      <p>The EastEnders cast clubbed together for a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/eastenders-maisie-smith-wins-children-in-needs-strictly-come-dancing-special-as-fans-beg-her-to-compete-for-real-11165825/">Strictly Come Dancing special</a>, which was won by Maisie Smith, who plays young Tiffany Butcher, and Kevin Clifton.</p>
      <p>Rylan Clark-Neal did a 24-hour Karaokethon earlier this week, resulting in tears as he <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/rylan-clark-neal-raises-1m-donations-exhausting-24-hour-karaoke-challenge-11124622/">passed the £1million mark</a> by himself.</p>
      <p>Olivia Colman, Suranne Jones, Luke Evans and Jim Broadbent recorded their own special covers of pop hits for a Got It Covered album, which <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/08/olivia-colmans-children-need-album-gets-number-one-despite-removal-album-chart-11069068/">went straight in at number one</a> on the compilations charts.</p>
      <p>Last year, Children in Need raised over £50million – you can<a href="http://bbc.co.uk/pudsey"> donate here</a>.</p>
