      <p>Another gushed: "U always best @kyliejenner."</p>
      <p>A third could hardly contain their enthusiasm: "I love you Queen @kyliejenner."</p>
      <p>She'd already teased that the collection was "around the corner" while she rocked an enormous red bow on her head.</p>
      <p>The latest offering comes amid a flurry of rumours of a romantic spark between Kylie and rapping sensation Drake.</p>
      <p>She recently called it quits with ex and father of her daughter Stormi, Travis Scott - but the rumours claim she's found another romantic rapper in Drake.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/">The Sun</a> reported that Kylie wanted to keep the rumored romance from her family, as her half-sister <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kim-kardashian">Kim Kardashian</a> is married to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kanye-west">Kanye West</a> who was previously said to be locked in a feud with Drake.</p>
      <p>A source told the publication: "[Kylie] wanted to keep the news from her sister Kim Kardashian who is married to Kanye West.</p>
      <p>"However, there's no suggestion that there was any overlap with Kylie's ex-boyfriend Travis Scott, the father of her daughter Stormi, who she split from this year."</p>
      <p>Despite the split, Kylie and Travis seem to be on good terms, as Kylie took one year old Stormi to cheer on her daddy at his Astroworld Music Festival in Houston, Texas.</p>
      <p>A source told <a href="https://people.com/">People</a> : "It was important for her to support Travis' festival. They are still very close and often hang out with Stormi."</p>
