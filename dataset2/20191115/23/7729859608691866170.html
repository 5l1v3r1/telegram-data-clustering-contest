        <b>Sweden striker Alexander Isak was subjected to racist abuse by Romania fans during a European Qualifier on Friday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Isak came off the bench for Sweden in the 78th minute of his side's 2-0 win, and the game was halted about two minutes later after the 20-year-old complained to the referee about the abuse.</p>
      <p>Play was allowed to continue after those in the stadium were warned of their conduct.</p>

      <p>After the match, Isak told Swedish broadcaster <i>C More</i>: "I just asked the referee if he heard anything. A couple of minutes later he paused the match and said he had heard something.</p>
      <p>"He asked me 'shall I stop the game?'. I said no, you don't need to do that. Racist words, things that shouldn't happen. It's incredibly sad."</p>
      <p>The Real Sociedad forward finished the game and led the celebrations in front of the Romanian supporters.</p>
      <p>The victory sees Sweden progress to Euro 2020 with a game to spare, ending Romania's chances to qualify in the process.</p>
