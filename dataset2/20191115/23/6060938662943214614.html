      <p>NEW DELHI: The government has decided not to release the 2017-18 <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/consumer-expenditure-survey">consumer expenditure survey</a> due to data quality issues after a news report said the survey had shown that <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/consumer-spending">consumer spending</a> in rural areas had slumped the most in four decades, triggering a political storm.</p>
      <p>"The ministry is separately examining the feasibility of conducting the next consumer expenditure survey in 2020-2021 and 2021-22 after incorporating all data quality refinements in the survey process," the ministry of statistics and programme implementation said in a late evening statement.</p>
      <p>Earlier, opposition parties latched onto the news report on the survey findings with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi attacking the government for not releasing the survey findings and the economic plight in rural areas.</p>
      <p>"Modinomics stinks so bad, the govt has to hide its own reports," Rahul Gandhi said on Twitter, tagging the picture of the news report.</p>

      <p>The ministry said it had seen the media reports regarding consumer expenditure survey, stating that consumer spending is falling and the report has been withheld due to its 'adverse' findings. "We would like to emphatically state that there is a rigorous procedure for vetting of data and reports which are produced through surveys. All such submissions which come to the ministry are draft in nature and cannot be deemed to be the final report," said MOSPI.</p>
      <p>It said the results of the survey were examined and it was noted that there was a significant increase in the divergence in not only levels of the consumption pattern but also direction of the change when compared to other administrative data sources like actual production of goods and services.</p>
      <p>The statement said concerns were also raised about the ability/sensitivity of survey instrument to capture consumption of social services by households, especially on health and education.</p>
