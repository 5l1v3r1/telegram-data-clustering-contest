      <p>Cody Fajardo will play in Sunday’s West Division final.</p>
      <p>However, the Saskatchewan Roughriders haven’t decided whether the team’s franchise quarterback and the 2019 CFL leader in passing yards will start against the visiting Winnipeg Blue Bombers with a Grey Cup berth on the line.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know if he will start, but he’ll be dressed as one of our three quarterbacks and he will play,” Riders head coach Dickenson said after Friday’s practice at Mosaic Stadium.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/passed-the-test-cody-fajardo-throws-during-riders-closed-practice">Fajardo is still recovering from oblique muscle injury that he suffered during a practice on Oct. 30.</a>
      </p>
      <p>He missed the Riders’ 23-13 win over the Edmonton Eskimos on Nov. 2 that clinched first place in the West Division for the Green and White. Rookie Isaac Harker filled in for Fajardo, completing 23 of 28 passes for 213 yards without any touchdowns or interceptions.</p>
      <p>Harker will likely start if Fajardo doesn’t. <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-backup-quarterback-bryan-bennett-making-a-name-for-himself-on-special-teams">Bryan Bennett, the third-string quarterback, would also see action.</a></p>
      <p>“I feel comfortable with Isaac running the offence and I do as well with Bryan,” Dickenson said. “Bryan is more of our short-yardage quarterback and he’s involved on special teams. I think you’ll see a mix of all three quarterbacks on offence.”</p>
      <p>The mix is a nod toward the uncertainty regarding Fajardo’s injury.</p>
      <p>“We want to get all of our players ready to go,” Dickenson said. “If Cody cannot get through the game, we’ll go with Isaac and Bryan, or we may go with a mix of all three.”</p>
      <p>Fajardo practised on Friday, but was limited to short and intermediate pass attempts. The 27-year-old quarterback didn’t attempt any longer passes.</p>
      <p>“We didn’t ask him to do too much (Friday),” Dickenson said. “He was out here, going through the motions, and threw the ball a little bit. I think he’s going to be fine.”</p>
      <p>Receiver Shaq Evans was at Friday’s practice, but didn’t participate. Evans is nursing a foot injury that he suffered in Saskatchewan’s win over the Eskimos.</p>
      <p>“(Evans) is planning on playing,” Dickenson said. “He didn’t practise today because his foot is bothering him. We’ll see and it’s a decision that we have to make tomorrow.”</p>
      <p>Evans led the Riders in receiving yards (1,334) and added five touchdown receptions. If Evans isn’t available, Kenny Stafford or Justin McInnis would fill his role.</p>
      <p>The Riders sent returner Christion Jones to the Edmonton Eskimos on Aug. 5 for Stafford. The seven-year CFL veteran hasn’t dressed for a game since the trade.</p>
      <p>“I’m always prepared to play and that’s being a professional athlete,” Stafford said. “I’ve been on the 46-man roster and the one-game injured list, but it’s always preparing to play so you don’t have to get ready.”</p>
      <p>Stafford got off to a fast start with the Eskimos, with 30 receptions for 366 yards and two touchdowns in seven regular-season games.</p>
      <p>Despite those impressive statistics, he hasn’t been able to crack the Riders’ deep group of receivers.</p>
      <p>“This is the most difficult season that I’ve had to go through from the standpoint that I’ve done everything that I was supposed to do and I still came up short,” said the 29-year-old Stafford. “I still come up short. My mom always told if you do what you’re supposed to do, you get to do what you want to do.</p>
      <p>“In this form, I’ve had to sit back and be the best teammate and best player and continue to get better. You can’t allow the situation to make you feel some type of way or doubt your ability or your preparation. You still have to be a pro.”</p>
      <p>Stafford doesn’t plan to deviate from those plans if Evans is ready to play on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“If I don’t get the call, then I will be the best teammate I can be,” Stafford said. “I will be getting the fans loud and whatever the players see, I will talk to the coaches and translate it to them. That’s my role.”</p>
