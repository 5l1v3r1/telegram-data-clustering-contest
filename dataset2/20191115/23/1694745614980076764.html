      <h1>I Tried a Fake Bungee Ponytail to Look Like Ariana Grande in Minutes</h1>

      <p>I first saw the <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/buy/Hidden-Crown-Hair-Bungee-Ponytail-518670?url_pos=body-url&amp;p_name=Hidden%20Crown%20Hair%20Bungee%20Ponytail&amp;retailer=hiddencrownhair.com&amp;pid=518670&amp;price=199&amp;evar1=bella%3Aus&amp;evar3=article%3Agallery-one&amp;evar9=46907475&amp;evar98=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popsugar.com%2Fbeauty%2Fcrown-extensions-bungee-ponytail-review-46907475&amp;list1=hair%2Chair%20extensions%2Cponytails%2Cnewsletter%2Coriginal%20feature%2Ceditor%20experiments&amp;prop13=desktop&amp;page_name=bella%3Aus%3Aarticle%3Acrown-extensions-bungee-ponytail-review-46907475&amp;pdata=17359799">Hidden Crown Hair Bungee Ponytail</a> ($199) on <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/Best-Celebrity-Hairstylists-46299693">celebrity hairstylist</a> Justine Marjan's Instagram, where she was showing followers how to get a <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/60s-style-ponytail-tutorial-46864828">'60s hairstyle</a>. She used the extension on the model, and I instantly knew I needed to try it out. I went online, tried to match my hair color (I chose shade 6), and waited for my new Remy extension to arrive.</p>
      <p>Whenever I put up my hair, I never feel like it looks very cute. Instead, it looks like I was lazy. I hoped with my new bungee style, my pony would look more like Ariana Grande and less like I forgot to wash my hair.</p>
      <p>When the bungee ponytail arrived in the mail, I noticed it came with some little swatches of other colors, in case the one I ordered wasn't a match. Although the one I chose was a little too light, I decided to go with it and hoped for the best. I prepared by straightening my waves and putting my hair up into a ponytail.</p>
      <p>Once my hair was up, it was time to use the extension. I grabbed it and looped the center hook onto my elastic scrunchie. I then grabbed the left hook and wrapped it around my own hair, looping the bungee to hair beneath my own ponytail, and repeated the process on the other side. To hide where the extension and my hair met, I took a small section of hair from underneath the ponytail and wrapped it around the base. I secured the end with a bobby pin.</p>
      <p>While it took some practice, I found the extension surprisingly easy to use. In a few minutes, my ponytail went from boring to statement-making and gave me the thickest head of hair I've ever had. That being said, the extra weight was significant, and I'm not sure if I would be able to handle the tension headaches on a regular basis. However, I'm going to reserve this look for my next special occasion and make sure to take photos for my Instagram feed. Check out the before-and-after photos ahead.</p>
