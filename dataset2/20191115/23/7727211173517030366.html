      <p>A sold out Radio City Hits Live show burst back into the M&amp;S Arena tonight and it certainly didn’t disappoint the thousands.</p>
      <p>Pop music lovers certainly got their money’s worth, as fans seen nine stars for the price of one.</p>
      <p>The magic of the event is that it brings together a handful of the most in demand voices that are topping the UK radio charts right now.</p>
      <p>It’s a concept that is more frequently seen at festivals but thankfully audiences were under cover and in the comfort of an arena setting, much like a concert.</p>
      <p>Unlike your standard festival or concert however, the event was hosted like a real radio show by Radio City presenters Leanne &amp; Dave.</p>
      <p>Those in the audience could also watch Jordan Lee behind the scenes with the stars for extra juicy gossip with the performers.</p>

      <p>Fleur East and Gregg and James also took to the stage to entertain crowds with games and announce that Radio City Hits Live will be returning in May 2020.</p>
      <p><b>Who was on the line-up?</b> James Arthur, John Newman, Jax Jones, Sigala, Freya Ridings, HVRY, Becky Hill, Raye and Joel Corry</p>
      <p><b>Opening song:</b> Joel Corry opened the show and had the whole crowd dancing to club songs such as Freed From Desire and 17 by MK. Kids were bouncing about with there glow sticks and their parents where giving it a good go too. First impressions, this is going to be a hyperactive night ahead.</p>

      <p><b>How many songs did each artist get?</b> Each performer treated crowds to three or four songs. The good thing about that is the stars pick their most well known hits , so they don’t disappoint fans.</p>
      <p><b>Best moment:</b> Although she wasn’t on the lineup Ella Henderson turned up for surprise collaborations with Jax Jones and Sigala.</p>
      <p><b>Best song:</b> Providing a change in tempo was Freya Ridings with Lost Without You. for me her voice stood out the most. However the vast majority of the younger audience would say it was any song sang by HRVY. The young pop star and YouTube sensation got the loudest screams from the audience.</p>
      <p><b>Last song:</b> James Arthur took to the stage to finish off what was a brilliant night, enjoyed by music lovers of all ages, with Say You Won’t Let Go.</p>
