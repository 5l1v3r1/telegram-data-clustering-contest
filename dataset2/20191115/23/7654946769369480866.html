      <h1>Fantasy football: Jimmy Garoppolo is primed for big week vs. Cardinals</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T23:17:09+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 23:17</time> by <a rel="author">Drew Loftis</a></address>
      <p>It seems unbelievable now, but there was a time when the future fantasy prospects of Jimmy Garoppolo and Patrick Mahomes were not terribly different. It was just 15 or so months ago.</p>
      <p>At that time, heading in last season’s fantasy drafts, we had seen two meaningful games started by Garoppolo — averaged 248 yards and had four total touchdowns with no interceptions. Mahomes had one NFL game on his ledger, a meaningless Week 17 game, in which he had 284 yards, no TDs and one pick.</p>
      <p>Those were not fantastic numbers by either, but both showed promise. No one was forecasting Mahomes <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/10/what-return-of-chiefs-patrick-mahomes-will-mean-for-nfl/">would become the league MVP</a>. No one expect Garoppolo to be knocked out for the season in September.</p>
      <p>Look, there is no comparing the two anymore. The Madman just wants to provide a refresher as to how, not too long ago, there were high hopes for Garoppolo’s fantasy potential.</p>
      <p>He hasn’t delivered. He is averaging a paltry 14.2 fantasy points per game. Of starting quarterbacks who had played every game this year, headed into Week 11, Jimmy G had outscored just Baker Mayfield and Mitchell Trubisky. That’s bad.</p>
      <p>Yet bad fantasy numbers don’t automatically mean he is a bad QB. It just means he isn’t the fantasy stalwart some were expecting him to be a little more than a year ago. And that doesn’t exclude him from having good fantasy games every once in a while.</p>
      <p>Enter the Cardinals. Garoppolo’s 49ers are coming off their first loss of the season. They are facing an Arizona team that gave them more of a game than they envisioned two weeks ago. The Niners won’t take them lightly this time. They will be angry and we expect them to win handily. Winning handily means scoring plenty of points.</p>
      <p>In that 28-25 Week 9 win over the Cards, Garoppolo <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/31/jimmy-garoppolo-throws-four-tds-as-unbeaten-49ers-nip-cardinals/">had the best game of his career</a>: 28-for-37, 317 yards, four touchdowns, no interceptions and 28.9 fantasy points. And no, we don’t expect another career-best performance, but something even 75 percent of that is still a strong fantasy day. Especially if you’re streaming at QB, need a filler this week for Matthew Stafford, want to avoid having to use Carson Wentz or Kirk Cousins, or are sick of getting burned by Jared Goff.</p>
      <p>Yes, we are aware Garoppolo likely will be without the services of receiver Emmanuel Sanders and tight end George Kittle. He also won’t have the secondary part of his backfield, with <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/13/fantasy-football-week-11-start-em-sit-em-melvin-gordon-kenyan-drake/">Matt Breida expected to be out</a>.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, we are confident using him this week based on the other intangibles mentioned earlier and the recent emergence of wideout Deebo Samuel. The rookie was peppered with 11 targets last week, hauling in eight for 112 yards. In five total starts this season, Samuel has at least seven targets in three — the two others were his Week 1 NFL debut and his return to the starting lineup in Week 8.</p>
      <p>Samuel has just one TD this season, but don’t be surprised if he tacks on to that total. It’ll be Dee’ and Jimmy G, just you wait and see.</p>
