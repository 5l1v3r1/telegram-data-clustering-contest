      <h1>Legendary Television is Developing a Sin City TV Series</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T23:09:58+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 23:09</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Abbate</a></address>
      <p>In 2005, Frank Miller teamed up with Robert Rodriguez to bring Miller’s <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/sin-city"><b>Sin City</b></a> comics to the big screen. Now, the two are about to re-team for more neo-noir stories in a different medium. <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/sin-city-tv-series-frank-miller-robert-rodriguez-legendary-television-1202787314/">Deadline</a> brings word that Miller has closed a deal with Legendary to adapt <b>Sin City</b> for TV. Rodriguez is reportedly in the final stages of joining the project as well.</p>
      <p>If Legendary reaches an agreement with Rodriguez, he will executive produce the series alongside Miller, Stephen L’Heureux, and Silenn Thomas. L’Heureux was an executive producer on <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/sin-city-a-dame-to-kill-for"><b>Sin City: A Dame to Kill For</b></a>; while Thomas is the CEO of Miller’s production company. The graphic themes of <b>Sin City</b> likely mean that the series will end up on a premium network or a streaming service. But apparently, the deal promises a full season as long as the producers can find it a suitable home. Miller’s contract also stipulates that he will write a “hard R” animated prequel to his comics.</p>

      <p>This isn’t the first time that Hollywood has attempted to bring <b>Sin City</b> to the small screen. <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/news/398249-sin-city-tv-series-in-the-works-with-glen-mazzara-and-len-wiseman">Back in 2017</a>, The Weinstein Company began working with Dimension Films to produce a series with former <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/the-walking-dead"><b>The Walking Dead</b></a> showrunner Glen Mazzara writing the script and Len Wiseman directing the pilot. After The Weinstein Company’s well-publicized collapse, that incarnation of the show went away.</p>
      <p>Miller and Rodriguez’s original <b>Sin City</b> film was a critically-acclaimed financial success. Unfortunately, <b>A Dame to Kill For</b> didn’t fare as well when it hit theaters in 2014. The sequel received middling reviews and was a box-office bomb, with only $39 million at the box office against its $65 million budget.</p>
