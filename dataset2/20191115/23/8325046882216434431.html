        <li>Microsoft hired US Attorney General Eric Holder to audit an Israeli facial recognition company called AnyVision.</li>
        <li>Microsoft invested in AnyVision this summer via M12, its venture capital arm. Microsoft’s investment was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2019/08/01/microsoft-slammed-for-investing-in-israeli-facial-recognition-spying-on-palestinians/#712921206cec">met with backlash by the ACLU</a>.</li>
        <li>News reports suggest AnyVision’s technology is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-funded-face-recognition-tech-reportedly-surveils-palestinians-2019-10">secretly used to monitor Palestinian residents in the West Bank</a>. AnyVision has denied that it uses facial recognition for surveillance in the West Bank.</li>
        <li>Microsoft has worked to establish itself as a leader in tech industry ethics, including by publishing in December six principles to guide its facial recognition work.</li>
        <li>Holder will reportedly lead a team of former federal prosecutors to investigate how the company’s technology is being used.</li>

      <p>Microsoft has<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/microsoft-hires-eric-holder-audit-anyvision-over-use-facial-recognition-n1083911"> hired former US Attorney General Eric Holder</a> to investigate an Israeli facial recognition company called AnyVision – in which Microsoft is an investor – and find out whether it complies with the Redmond-based company’s ethical principles guiding its work with the technology.</p>
      <p>The news was first reported by <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/microsoft-hires-eric-holder-audit-anyvision-over-use-facial-recognition-n1083911">Olivia Solon of NBC News</a> and confirmed by Microsoft to Business Insider.</p>
      <p>Microsoft has worked to establish itself as a leader in tech industry ethics, including by publishing in December <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2018/12/17/six-principles-to-guide-microsofts-facial-recognition-work/">six principles to guide its facial recognition work</a>. M12, Microsoft’s venture capital arm, recently announced that it would contribute to a $78 million Series A funding round for AnyVision.</p>
      <p>AnyVision’s facial recognition technology is used by the Israeli military at border crossing checkpoints to log the faces of Palestinians crossing into Israel. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/all/why-did-microsoft-fund-israeli-firm-surveils-west-bank-palestinians-n1072116">News reports</a>, however, suggest the technology is also secretly used to monitor Palestinian residents in the West Bank. AnyVision has denied that it uses facial recognition for surveillance in the West Bank.</p>
      <p>Microsoft’s investment drew immediate backlash from human rights advocates <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2019/08/01/microsoft-slammed-for-investing-in-israeli-facial-recognition-spying-on-palestinians/#712921206cec">including the ACLU.</a></p>
      <p>Holder will lead a team of former federal prosecutors at law firm Covington &amp; Burling to investigate how AnyVision’s technology is being used.</p>
      <p>“They will move quickly, reviewing documents and conducting on the ground interviews with AnyVision employees and others to ensure a full and thorough investigation,” a Microsoft spokesman said in a statement.</p>
