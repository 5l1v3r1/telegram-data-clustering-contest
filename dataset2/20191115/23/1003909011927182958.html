      <h1>Braid: Criticized for expenses, David Knight Legg speaks out on London trips</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T23:09:15+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 23:09</time> by <a rel="author">Don Braid, Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>The public trials of David Knight Legg, who’s suddenly famous in a way he doesn’t care for, raise a serious question.</p>
      <p>What should he do when, as he says, “a global bank guy in London calls to say I can meet you in four days for an afternoon to talk one-on-one about why they shouldn’t boycott the oilsands?”</p>
      <p>Should he go? Or stay at home and save, say, $5,000?</p>
      <p>To judge by <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/more-kenney-travel-woes-closest-advisor-bills-45000-in-london-travel/wcm/03e875bb-d31e-472f-ba1a-87a876434e90">the uproar over his travel bill</a> — $18,000 for four round trips to London — the UCP should have locked him in his office.</p>
      <p>Yes, there are difficult spending cuts. But refusing to take that invitation would make Alberta a joke around that London headquarters, and pretty much write the province off the investment map.</p>
      <p>So, of course, Knight Legg went to London.</p>
      <p>The result we don’t know — he’s cautious about naming names. But he makes no apology for his expenses.</p>
      <p>“I always fly economy class,” he said in an interview. “I always fly government protocol, I always get the hotel at government rates. I’ve only ever taken the statutory per diem.”</p>
      <p>Veteran travellers know that an $18,000 tab for four return trips to hyper-expensive London is almost a bargain.</p>
      <p>“You have to be there,” he said. “You have to spend time with the CEOs and answer questions. Do you know that some people actually think the oilsands is all of Canada’s energy industry?”</p>
      <p>The NDP is jumping up and down about his travels — actually demanding an auditor general investigation — even though, as premier, Rachel Notley travelled a great deal to tell Alberta’s story and lure investors.</p>
      <p>One issue with Knight Legg, perhaps, is that few people know who he is or what he’s up to.</p>
      <p>His mission as Premier Jason Kenney’s principal adviser is to break the ice that’s freezing investment in Alberta. The province has a lot of problems, but this might be the most serious of all.</p>
      <p>Knight Legg has been several times to Toronto, Montreal and New York. Also Mexico and California.</p>
      <p>London is crucial as a world centre of energy investment, he says. Next week he travels to Houston with Kenney. His total travel bill so far is $45,000.</p>
      <p>Previous premiers might have picked a minister to do this job. Kenney went for a genuine expert who can go beyond the pitch to actual substance.</p>
      <p>Knight Legg, 49, had a senior role with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, based in both Sydney and Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>He was managing director for Europe and Asia of Gerson Lehrman Group. He has nearly two decades of experience in international investment.</p>
      <p>Knight Legg is also a Lethbridge boy who earned his first university degree there.</p>
      <p>He went on to a master’s degree at Queen’s University, a law degree from Oxford and a PhD from Yale.</p>
      <p>Kenney lured him home to work on economic policy. He led the premier’s transition team into government.</p>
      <p>But it’s absurd to paint this as a patronage appointment. Knight Legg could be living in central London, rather than racing back and forth with minimal legroom.</p>
      <p>There’s a lot of pressure. He’s sort of like the Flames star Johnny Gaudreau — you take the job, you’d better score the goals. And his goal is to land major investments for the province.</p>
      <p>Knight Legg feels he’s already nailed one — the Telus decision to spend $16 billion in Alberta over five years to upgrade broadband.</p>
      <p>Opposition claims that this was already in the works are “absolutely false,” he says.</p>
      <p>“This is so frustrating. It was made completely clear to us during our entire negotiations that they (Telus) were significantly upping the total amount of capital … this was specifically done because of tax and other factors.”</p>
      <p>He adds: “There are three or four big projects in the $5- to $15-billion range that we’re working really hard on.</p>
      <p>“They’re interested in how we can collaborate with them to reduce regulatory restraints, simplify things, make sure this is the best environment to do business in.”</p>
      <p>Long gone are the days when investors sent money when they could hardly find Alberta on the map and Alberta’s trade missions were cushy patronage plums.</p>
      <p>It’s a more complex problem today. And Kenney has a senior emissary who actually knows the territory. Imagine that.</p>
