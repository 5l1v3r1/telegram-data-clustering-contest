      <p>Sony has announced its plans for the Android 10 rollout this year. The firm is joining <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/android-10-starts-rolling-out-for-nokia-phones-today-8-1-first/">Nokia</a>, <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/android-10-comes-to-the-oneplus-6t/">OnePlus</a> and <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/pixels-oneplus-xiaomi-and-essential-phones-recieve-android-10-updates-today/">Google</a> among others with its relatively early update schedule. The following Sony devices will be updated to Android 10 by early 2020 with the first two receiving it in December.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Xperia 1</li>
        <li>Xperia 5</li>
        <li>Xperia 10</li>
        <li>Xperia 10 Plus</li>
        <li>XZ2</li>
        <li>XZ2 Compact</li>
        <li>XZ2 Premium</li>
        <li>XZ3</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sony hasn’t said that users of devices not listed on this won’t be getting updates, but if they are, it won’t be for a while yet.</p>
      <p>Android 10 includes the following features which:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Dark Theme</b> – Google is finally adding a native dark theme to Android. This comes with a toggle in the quick settings area and allows users to flip their device theme at the touch of a finger.</li>
        <li><b>Gestures Support</b> – Love iOS gestures? You’ll be glad to see a version of them on Google’s Android 10.</li>
        <li><b>Live Caption</b> – Videos are automatically captioned, allowing users who are hard of hearing to understand what is being said even if they can’t hear it clearly. This works not only on web video but also on audio messages and captured videos.</li>
        <li><b>Privacy Controls</b> – Google has implemented more granular permissions, especially for things like storage and location. Users now have more control over what apps have access to on their devices.</li>
      </ul>
