      <p>Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Friday dismissed a petition filed by PRP Exports to de-freeze the firm’s bank accounts.</p>
      <p>Justice G. K. Ilanthiraiyan dismissed the petition taking cognisance of the fact that the High Court and the Supreme Court had already dismissed similar petitions filed by the firm.</p>
      <p>The court observed that the firm had illegally transported granite measuring 12.07 lakh cubic metres from its quarries.</p>
      <p>The value of the illicit quarry in the firm’s 16 granite quarries alone came to ₹4,124.14 crore. Therefore, under such circumstances, the relief sought could not be considered, the court said.</p>
      <p>A total of 53 cases have been registered against the firm under various offences. The trial in the cases are pending before a lower court in Madurai.</p>
