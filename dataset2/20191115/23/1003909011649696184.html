      <h1>Arbour Lake West offers fresh take on established area</h1>

      <p>While Nancy Bi and Feng Zuo didn’t want to leave the established northwest end of the city in which they live, they were ready for a new home.</p>
      <p>Their Scenic Acres single-family house, which they purchased in 1998, was built in the late 1980s.</p>
      <p>“I did a bit of a renovation,” says Bi, adding that what started as a bathroom project extended to something more extensive. “It’s a lot of work.”</p>
      <p>They looked at resale options within the neighbourhood, which was established in 1981, “but even the ones that were younger needed some kind of work,” adds Bi.</p>
      <p>The opportunity to build a new home in the direct vicinity emerged through the latest community by Hopewell Residential, the developer behind the award-winning lake community of Mahogany. Arbour Lake West, launched in September, within the existing community of Arbour Lake.</p>
      <p>Reaching 17.4 hectares, the new community is slated for 794 single-family homes, townhomes, and condos combined. All homes in the community will be by Hopewell’s home builder division.</p>
      <p>Residents of Arbour Lake West will be part of the Arbour Lake Homeowner’s Association, giving them access to its 17.4-hectare lake and the community’s existing green space.</p>
      <p>“Arbour Lake is consistently ranked as one of the best communities in all of Calgary featuring northwest Calgary’s only lake, plenty of nearby schools, and a natural wetland preserve,” says Graham Dredge, community sales manager, Arbour Lake West. “It also offers the opportunity to own a brand new home in an established community that already has all of the amenities that newer communities often lack for many years.”</p>
      <p>Bi and Zuo, who have two children, bought the Endeavour, a front-drive single-family model.</p>
      <p>There are nine single-family models available in the community, ranging from 1,097 to 2,660 square feet. This includes the Huxley and Jensen, which are floor plans designed exclusively for Arbour Lake West.</p>
      <p>Single-family homes in this community start at $607,800, including the lot and GST. They’re available in Craftsman, Arts and Crafts, and Modern Country exterior elevations.</p>
      <p>“Hopewell beautifully blended functional design with the modern home features buyers love,” says Dredge, on the floor plan lineup. “These homes offer open-concept main floors with over-sized kitchens that feature full-height cabinets. The homes also include large windows to flood the home with natural light, nine-foot basement foundation heights, and luxurious five-piece en suites.”</p>
      <p>For Bi and Zuo, the open-concept will be a refreshing change. The layout of their present home, which is largely enclosed rooms, “feels like you can play hide and seek,” says Bi.</p>
      <p>She’s particularly fond of her new home’s connected great room, kitchen, and dining area.</p>
      <p>“You can talk to a person watching TV while you’re cooking in the kitchen, so you have more interaction that way,” says Bi.</p>
      <p>In the home, overall, “they use every bit of the space to create more space,” she adds.</p>
      <p>Bi also singles out the second floor bonus room, and master bedroom that provides direct access to the laundry room as personal favourites.</p>
      <p>The bonus room not only provides a quiet place to tuck away, it creates a layer of privacy between the master of bedroom and secondary bedrooms, Bi says.</p>
      <p>One of the reasons the family wanted to stay in the area was to maintain a short distance to Bi’s parents who presently live in Scenic Acres.</p>
      <p>They used to be a five-minute walk away. Now it’s a 12-minute walk or seven minutes driving.</p>
      <p>“I think it’s good to be able to spend time with your parents,” says Bi, adding this proximity makes it easy to go for shopping outings together or enjoy dining at one of the many restaurants nearby.</p>
      <p>Bordered by Crowchild Trail and Country Hills Boulevard, Arbour Lake also offers easy access to the Rocky Mountains, something Bi and her family appreciate.</p>
      <p>“I love the mountains,” she says. “I can just go to Stoney Trail and then I’m done. I don’t have to go across the city.”</p>
      <p>The area is well-connected, overall, says Dredge.</p>
      <p>“This part of the city offers great access to downtown, the university, and around town with the nearby LRT station, as well as proximity to Crowchild and Stoney Trail,” he says. “You also get great views of the mountains and are a quick 30-minute drive to the Rockies.”</p>
