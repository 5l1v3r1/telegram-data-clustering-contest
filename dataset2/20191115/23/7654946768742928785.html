      <h1>Darren Sproles done for season — and possibly career — with quad injury</h1>

      <p>This might be it for for Darren Sproles.</p>
      <p>After struggling with injuries throughout the last two seasons, the 36-year-old running back will again be sidelined after <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeGarafolo/status/1195356606927642626">suffering a torn right hip flexor muscle</a> in practice this week.</p>
      <p>He will now miss the rest of the season, after he previously suffered a partial tear of the same muscle against the Jets in Week 5, according to a <a href="https://twitter.com/Eagles/status/1195358336176345088">team statement</a>.</p>
      <p>Sproles’ latest injury means he will finish this season with just 17 games (15 regular season, two postseason) played since 2017, spelling a potential end to an underrated career.</p>
      <p>A three-time Pro Bowl selection on special teams, Sproles currently ranks fifth all-time in all-purpose yards, largely in part to his prowess as a kick and punt returner. His tally of 19,696 yards ranks behind only Emmitt Smith, Walter Payton, Brian Mitchell and Jerry Rice.</p>
      <p>Despite his diminutive 5’6″ frame, Sproles has proven to be a durable player for much of his career, outlasting return specialist contemporaries such as Josh Cribbs and Devin Hester.</p>
      <p>Now, he may choose to hang it up.</p>

      <p>The running back’s injury means that the Eagles are turning to another familiar face for relief, as they re-signed Jay Ajayi to a deal on Friday.</p>
      <p>Ajayi hasn’t played an NFL game since tearing his ACL last October while playing for the Eagles.</p>
      <p>Both Ajayi and Sproles won the Super Bowl with Philadelphia in 2018, but Sproles played just three games that season after suffering an early season injury.</p>
      <p>The Eagles host the Patriots on Sunday.</p>
