      <h1>Insane statistic highlights Warriors' fall from grace</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T23:58:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 23:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thesportsdaily.com/author/tsd-staff/" target="_blank">TSD Staff</a></address>
      <p>The Warriors currently sit in last place in the Western Conference, sporting a 2-8 record, and it’s clear that a drastic turnaround just isn’t in the cards this year.</p>
      <p>Both Splash Bros. — Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson — are sidelined with injuries, as is Draymond Green as well. Kevin Durant is gone, so the team’s entire starting five from last season is no longer on the court.</p>
      <p>As such, the team is really struggling, and will likely continue to, with a strong possibility that the Warriors just tank the season away for a high draft pick next year.</p>
      <p>It’s crazy when you think about it, though, as the Warriors sported a 58-24 record last season, and have won the Western Conference five consecutive years. That sets up for a winning percentage drop of epic proportions. In fact, the Warriors are on pace for the largest winning percentage drop of any team in NBA history, according to <a href="https://hoopshype.com/2019/11/15/golden-state-warriors-worst-teams-year-over-year-nba-history/">this chart</a> from HoopsHype.</p>

      <p>The Warriors are entering uncharted territory — that’s for sure.</p>
