      <p>Alien epic The War of the Worlds is being revived in a three-part BBC drama.</p>
      <p>Originally a novel written in 1897 by HG Wells, left, the story tells of plucky humans fighting a superior race.</p>
      <p>The TV drama, set in Edwardian times, starts on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>Here is everything you need to know about it.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What is it all about?</b>
      </p>
      <p>In HG Wells’ book, Martians invade Earth when resources on their planet run out. Armed with heat rays and poisonous smoke, they try to destroy England’s infrastructure and exterminate humanity. The invasion starts in Surrey.</p>

      <p>In the BBC version, couple George and Amy (Rafe Spall and Eleanor Tomlinson) get caught up in the mayhem.</p>
      <p>In 1938, actor Orson Welles appeared on CBS radio to report that the planet had been invaded. He told how aliens were destroying the US.</p>
      <p>It was a play based on the book, but according to popular myth, thousands of New Yorkers fled their homes in panic. Residents in one town shot at a water tower they believed was a Martian craft.</p>
      <p>The reports have since been disputed and one survey revealed only 2% of those asked had listened.</p>

        <b>What’s new?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Amy is having an affair with the book’s narrator – originally unnamed – now called George. The characters’ chequered love lives are based on Wells’ own.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Who’s in it?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Eleanor and Rafe are joined by Robert Carlyle (right) as astronomer Ogilvy, the couple’s only friend. Sherlock’s Rupert Graves plays George’s brother Frederick.</p>

        <b>Where was it filmed?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mainly in Liverpool. Many of the city’s landmarks were used as backdrops including St George’s Hall, Sir Thomas Street and Dale Street.</p>
      <p>A crashed alien pod was created in Ainsdale Woods.</p>
      <p>Eleanor said: “To have a physical set that we could interact with, like our crash site, has been wonderful.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Are aliens convincing?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Much attention has been paid to make them realistic.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Do stars do the stunts?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes. In fact, Eleanor almost drowned while filming.</p>
      <p>She said: “There was a scene set in the sea, it was filmed in a big swimming pool. I had to dive in and swim to save a child.</p>
      <p>“That costume when it gets wet, let me tell you, I was like a lead balloon and I just went down and ended up sitting on the bottom of the pool just waiting for this diving team to rescue me. I was thinking: ‘Oh gosh I think I might die here, this is quite strange’.”</p>
