      <p><a href="https://www.binance.com/en">Malta-based Binance</a>, one of the world’s busiest cryptocurrency exchanges, and<a href="https://tron.network/"> Tron</a>, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">the 11th largest blockchain project,</a> have had their accounts blocked on Weibo, a Chinese social media site similar to Twitter, <i>The Block</i><a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/47243/binances-weibo-account-has-been-blocked-due-to-violations-of-laws"> reports.</a></p>
      <p>According to the outlet, all content, including the follower count, has been wiped from Binance’s <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">Weibo</a> page.</p>
      <p>The page now states: “The account has been blocked due to violations of laws and regulations and the relevant provisions of the Weibo Community Convention.”</p>
      <p>No details explaining the ban are provided.</p>
      <p><a href="http://m.chinatimes.net.cn/article/91757.html">According to <i>China Times</i>,</a> the suspension means Binance has lost, “its most important marketing position.”</p>
      <p>Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) may have poked the bear October 9th when he announced on Twitter that his exchange would soon enable fiat on-boarding via Alipay and WeChat, two popular Chinese payments channels.</p>
      <blockquote>“NO, you cannot,” Alipay responded swiftly under his post.</blockquote>
      <p>According to China Times, “Since then, Alipay and WeChat Payment also issued a statement stating that virtual currency transactions are not supported, and virtual currency category merchants have never been opened.”</p>
      <p>Zhao backtracked on October 9th and stated that the enablement was unsuccessful.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin trading was officially banned in China in December 2016. This was followed by a series of progressive bans on other crypto activity, including promotion.</p>
      <p>The bans were announced but appear to have been spottily enforced, and it is believed that Chinese citizens continue to speculate on cryptos via OTC desks, offshore exchanges and word-of-mouth schemes.</p>
      <p>The TRON project has also reportedly lost its Weibo account.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2019/07/149896-trons-justin-sun-apologizes-for-vulgar-promoting-of-lunch-with-warren-buffet/">In July, TRON founder Justin Sun abruptly cancelled his much touted charity lunch with Warren Buffet, and stated that he was ill from kidney stones.</a>
      </p>
      <p>Sun paid almost $4.7 million USD for the right to dine with Buffet, an investing icon in China.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2019/07/149804-trons-justin-sun-postpones-charity-lunch-with-warren-buffet-as-rumours-of-arrest-swirl/">Pundits speculated that Sun cancelled the lunch because he feared he might be arrested following media reports that he is wanted in China.</a>
      </p>
      <p>Sources to the media said Chinese authorities were angry that Sun appeared to be parading his wealth <a href="https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2019/07/149350-protestors-bilked-by-tron-impersonation-scam-occupy-affiliate-office-in-beijing/">at the same time as fraudulent TRON copycat projects were stealing the lifesavings of investors in China. </a></p>
      <p>Offices of a TRON affiliate were occupied and there was a report of an associated suicide.</p>
      <p>Sun later took to Chinese social media to apologized for his “vulgar” and “out of control” marketing of the lunch with Warren Buffet.</p>
      <blockquote>“(I) would like to express my sincere apologies to the public, the media, the leaders and regulators who care for me,” Sun wrote on Weibo before promising to keep a lower profile in the future.</blockquote>
