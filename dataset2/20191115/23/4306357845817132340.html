      <h3>Tammy Abraham has revealed that he considers Arsenal legend Thierry Henry to be one of his biggest footballing idols.</h3>
      <p>The Chelsea FC striker has been earning lots of praise for the impressive form he has shown this season since being handed a regular run in the first team by Frank Lampard at Stamford Bridge.</p>
      <p>Abraham has scored 10 goals and made two assists in 12 Premier League games for Chelsea FC this season, with Lampard opting to give the young striker a chance to impress in the Blues team.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old has also scored once and made one assist in four Champions League games for the west London club this season.</p>
      <p>Abraham is looking to write his name into Chelsea FC folklore as he bids to continue his fine form for the Blues.</p>
      <p>And the striker has now revealed that he idolised Arsenal legend Henry while growing up.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview quoted by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/chelseas-tammy-abraham-names-former-arsenal-man-utd-players-football-role-models-11147137/">Metro</a>, Abraham said: “He [Henry] was one of my biggest idols growing up.</p>
      <p>“I loved his style, the way he played and the way he carried himself on the pitch.</p>
      <p>“I even loved his goal celebrations! They were really cool and he’s just someone I’ve always looked up to.”</p>
      <p>The striker also pointed to Cristiano Ronaldo as being an influence on his career.</p>
      <p>He added: “The other player would be Cristiano Ronaldo. I’ve grown up loving him and it’s amazing that he’s still going strong today.</p>
      <p>|He’s hardworking and so professional. He looks like a nice guy, even though I’ve never actually met him myself, and he looks like the sort of person that just wants to win, which is a mentality I have.”</p>
      <p>Chelsea FC will return to Premier League action after the international break when they take on Manchester City away from home next weekend.</p>
      <p>The Blues are currently third in the Premier League table as they seek a top-four finish this season.</p>
