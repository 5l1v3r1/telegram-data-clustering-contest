      <p>Yet another opponent for Ariane Lipski has been removed from the upcoming UFC Sao Paulo card. Originally paired up against Priscila Cachoeira – who tested positive for a banned diuretic – the ‘Queen of Violence’ was then re-booked for a bout against Veronica Macedo. Unfortunately, according to <a href="https://lasueur.com/veronica-macedo-ufc-sao-paulo-15-11-2019">La Sueur.com’s</a> report, the Venezuelan has also been forced from the card due to health issues, citing strong headaches.</p>

      <p>Instead, Lipski will take on Octagon newcomer Isabella de Padua (5-1), who took the fight on just 48-hours notice (as reported by <a href="https://twitter.com/guicruzzz/status/1195355827743469570?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1195355827743469570&amp;ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc">MMA Fighting’s Guilherme Cruz</a>). Padua, however, missed the flyweight mark, weighing at 130.5 pounds. The bout will go on, though, after Padua agreed to give up 30% of her purse to Lipski.</p>

      <p>On a five-winning streak, the UFC newcomer has only lost her professional debut—a submission defeat to UFC flyweight Luana Carolina, in May 2015. In the time since, Padua picked up wins on the Brazilian and Mexican regional circuits. Her latest victory came at Standout Fighting Tournament 17, just last month, where she scored a TKO win over Rayanne Amanda.</p>
      <p>UFC Fight Night 164 is set for November 16, in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The card is scheduled to be headlined by a light heavyweight bout between contender Jan Blachowicz and former Strikeforce middleweight champion Ronaldo ‘Jacare’ Souza.</p>
