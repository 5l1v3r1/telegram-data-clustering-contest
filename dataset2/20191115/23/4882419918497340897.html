      <p>Decisive, once again. When isn't he? Not even a friendly stops the best in histoy. His voracity knows no limits. Especially against Brazil.</p>
      <p>Leo Messi scored the goal as Barcelona beat the Selecao 1-0 in a Saudi Arabia friendly.</p>
      <p>"It's important to get the win because in these processes, when you win, you work much more calmly," said Messi.</p>
      <p>"I finished (the game) well, we all ran a lot but it's the type of game you have to do that against a team like Brazil.</p>
      <p>Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni added: "In the first half we had things to improve, but we faced Brazil so that's normal. The second half I liked. We made a lot of changes to experiment.</p>
      <p>"The result is important, it's always nice to beat Brazil."</p>
