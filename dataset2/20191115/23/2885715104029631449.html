      <p>Private cruise ferry services between Hazira Port in Surat and Bandra-Worli Sea Link in Mumbai were flagged off from the Essar Ports jetty terminal at Hazira, on Friday morning.</p>
      <p>The Essar Bulk Terminal Ltd (EBTL), part of private sector port and terminal developer Essar Ports, completed work on the passenger ferry terminal which paved the way for a cruise-based passenger ferry service. The terminal has been built in a record time of eight months.</p>
      <p>SSR Marine Services of Mumbai, in-charge of the project, had earlier conducted a meeting with the stakeholders in Surat and briefed them about the services.</p>
      <p>The ferry cruise services will run once a week to-and-fro between Mumbai and Surat. The cruise will leave Bandra-Worli Sea Link on Thursdays at 5 pm and reach Hazira on Fridays at 9 am. The same cruise will leave Surat on Fridays at 5 pm and reach Mumbai on Saturdays at 9 am. Ticket rates range from Rs 3,000 to Rs 5,000, depending on facilities.</p>
      <p>The cruise has 20 rooms that can accommodate over 250 passengers. Phase I of the terminal project will focus on the movement of passengers between Hazira in Surat and Mumbai. The company said it plans to extend the service to other coastal locations in Gujarat.</p>
      <p>The cruise was flagged off by the MD and CEO of Essar ports, Rajiv Agarwal, from the Hazira Passenger Ferry Terminal on Friday morning. He said, “The ferry service will be a huge boost to tourism in Gujarat. We look forward to contributing to similar projects that will help unleash the tremendous potential of coastal transport in India by using the country’s extensive network of inland waterways.”</p>
