      <p>NAPLES, Fla. â€” Many of us here in Southwest Florida cherish our time on the beach, but how great would it be if we could enjoy them with our pets?</p>
      <p>Next Tuesday the City of Naples Community Services Advisory Board will hold a public meeting to discuss resident requests to allow off-leash dogs at Lowdermilk Park Beach Monday throughout Friday from sunrise to 8:30 am.</p>
      <p>At this time Collier County doesn't allow dogs on beaches. Dana Souza, with the board, says they have been getting several responses.</p>
      <p>"We've been receiving a lot more emails today. We haven't tallied them; the majority of them have been opposed to allowing dogs off-leash on the beach," said Souza.</p>
      <p>Souza even broke down the numbers.</p>
      <p>"44% of Naples residents supported it, while 56% of residents opposed it. compared to 69 % of nonresidents who supported 31% of nonresidents opposed it," said Souza.</p>
      <p>Cindy Myers started the petition and felt a designated time frame would accommodate everyone.</p>
      <p>"So I just thought it would be a great opportunity to appease everybody so the people aren't even here so they can't be bothers by the dogs and the owners who have the dogs can enjoy the beach," said Myers.</p>
      <p>Myers says many people are concerned about wildlife, but there's no need to worry.</p>
      <p>"There are no nesting snowbirds, and even during high tide, there's enough beach there, the dogs would be in the dunes to impact any Gofer Tortoises," said Myers.</p>
      <p>Myers wants residents and their furry friends to enjoy the beach.</p>
