      <p><b>LOS ANGELESÂ (AP)</b> - The 92nd Oscars is getting some fresh faces behind the production.</p>
      <p>The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences says Friday that Lynette Howell Taylor and Stephanie Allain will produce the February show.</p>
      <p>While newcomers to the Academy Awards, both are veteran producers in the industry. Howell Taylor is an Oscar-nominated producer of "A Star Is Born." Allain, who runs the company Homegrown Pictures, has been behind films like "Hustle &amp; Flow" and "Dear White People."</p>
      <p>Film academy president David Rubin says they'll bring dynamism and excitement to the show, but it remains unclear whether there will be a host.</p>
      <p>Last year's host-less Oscars saw an uptick in viewership after a record-low year.</p>
      <p>The 2020 Oscars will be broadcast live on ABC on Feb. 9.</p>
