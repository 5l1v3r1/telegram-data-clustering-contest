        <b>SNP SOURCES have admitted they feared a Lib Dem vote surge in Britain’s most marginal Westminster seat despite landing two new councillors in nearby areas.</b>

      <p>Success for the Nats in Fife saw them take Dunfermline Central from the Tories and keep Rosyth.</p>

      <p>But in Dunfermline the Lib Dems upped their support by over 13 per cent to take third place.</p>
      <p>If that increase is replicated across the region at the General Election then North East Fife could change hands.</p>
      <p>The SNP’s Stephen Gethins won the seat from the Lib Dems by just two votes in 2017.</p>
      <p>A senior SNP source said: “This could mean trouble for Stephen.</p>
      <p>“If there is tactical voting, if the Tories go over to the Lib Dems or if the kind of surge we saw in Dunfermline is replicated across the whole of Fife, he could be in bother.”</p>
      <p>North East Fife was a Lib Dem stronghold for years.</p>
      <p>It was formerly home to Sir Menzies Campbell who served briefly as party leader.</p>
      <p>Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said: “We came close to winning the Dunfermline by-election, with a soaring share of the vote.</p>
      <p>"“At the same time Scottish Labour’s vote has collapsed.</p>
      <p>"Jeremy Corbyn has spent this week touring Scotland unable to give a straight answer on independence.</p>
      <p>"It looks like the public have given him a straight answer back.”</p>
      <p>But the SNP’s Dunfermline and West Fife candidate, Douglas Chapman said: “These stunning by-election wins show that voters are getting behind the SNP to beat the Tories.</p>
      <p>"The SNP is the main challenger in every Tory held seat in Scotland, and only a vote for the SNP on 12th December can lock the Tories out of government and protect Scotland’s interests.</p>
      <p>“I’m delighted people in Dunfermline, Rosyth and across the country are putting their trust in the SNP to deliver for Scotland.</p>
      <p>"The coming election will be one of the most important in Scotland’s history.</p>
      <p>"The SNP will work hard for every vote, so together we can boot Boris Johnson out of power, get away from the Brexit crisis, and protect Scotland’s right to choose our own future.”</p>
