      <h1>Chelsea issue warning to Jody Morris after he mocked Jose Mourinho</h1>

      <p>Jody Morris has been warned by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/chelsea-fc/">Chelsea</a> as to his future social media conduct after the Blues coach trolled <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/frank-lampard/">Frank Lampard</a>’s right-hand man <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/frank-lampard-assistant-jody-morris-mocks-jose-mourinho-chelsea-worries-11078055/">took two swipes at the former Chelsea boss</a> following his comments about the current state of affairs at Stamford Bridge.</p>
      <p>Although Mourinho admitted there had been great progress at Chelsea, the Portuguese said he was still ‘worried’ about their defending in the big Premier League games.</p>
      <p>Morris, Chelsea’s assistant coach, gleefully responded to Mourinho by pretending to cry in an Instagram video with Bitter Sweet Symphony by The Verve playing in the background and ridiculing the comments on Twitter.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7690741/Chelsea-warn-Jody-Morris-social-media-use-mocked-bitter-Jose-Mourinho.html">Daily Mail</a> claim Chelsea were massively unimpressed with Morris’ swipes at Mourinho, feeling they were ‘unbecoming and inappropriate’ from a senior member of Lampard’s staff.</p>

      <p>Morris has been issued with a warning and told to show more ‘restraint’ in the future when it comes to responding to criticism.</p>
      <p>‘In the first weekend I was worried and I’m still worried with the big matches,’ Mourinho said of Chelsea.</p>
      <p>‘They lost twice against United, they lost against Liverpool at home, they conceded four goals against Ajax and I’m very, very curious to see Chelsea in the next match at the Etihad.</p>

      <p>‘I’m curious to see if they found that great empathy between the good football they play and the pragmatism that the top teams must have to play against top teams.’</p>
      <p>While Lampard has admitted Chelsea need to improve in defence, the Blues are currently tied second in the Premier League table.</p>
