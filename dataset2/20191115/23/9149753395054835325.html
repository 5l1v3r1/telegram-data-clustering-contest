      <p>Capcom announced today that <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/mega-man-zero-zx-legacy-collection/">Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection</a>, which was supposed to be out in January, has run into a bit of a snag and won't actually be available until February 25, 2020.</p>
      <p>"As many of you are aware, Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection was initially planned for release on January 21, 2020," Capcom <a href="http://www.capcom-unity.com/capkel/blog/2019/11/14/mega-man-zerozx-legacy-collection-delayed-to-february-25-2020">said</a>. "However, the team made the tough decision to move the gameâ€™s release date back in order to bring you the best possible collection of these cherished classics and deliver a game that will live up to your expectations."</p>
      <p>The response from the Mega Man community on Twitter has been remarkably supportive. Naturally there's disappointment, but the broad sentiment appears to be one of: "Don't sweat it." I guess one of the benefits of making people wait years for sequels is that a few more months doesn't feel so bad.</p>
