      <h1>Sources: Carmelo Anthony won't make Trail Blazers debut before Tuesday</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T23:45:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 23:45</time> by <a rel="author">Adrian Wojnarowski</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1975/carmelo-anthony">Carmelo Anthony</a> isn't expected to make his <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/por/portland-trail-blazers">Portland Trail Blazers</a> debut until Tuesday's game at New Orleans at the earliest, league sources tell ESPN.</p>
      <p>Anthony, 35, has to complete a physical with the Blazers before the one-year, non-guaranteed contract is finalized -- and that could some as soon as Saturday, league sources said.</p>
      <p>The Blazers are starting a six-game road trip that includes games against San Antonio (Saturday) and Houston (Monday). Struggling with frontcourt injuries, including power forward <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066650/zach-collins">Zach Collins</a> and center <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3102530/jusuf-nurkic">Jusuf Nurkic</a>, Portland has struggled to a 4-8 start to the season. The Blazers reached the Western Conference Finals a year ago.</p>
      <p>The Blazers are hopeful that Anthony can bring an immediate presence to a locker room that needs a jolt. Anthony, a 10-time All-Star and future Hall of Famer, hasn't played a game since a 10-game run with the Rockets that ended early in the 2018-2019 season.</p>
