      </p>
      <p>Good morning. My name is Emma and I will be your operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome you all to Celsion Third Quarter 2019 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]</p>
      <p>At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Kim Golodetz. Please go ahead, ma'am.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Kim Golodetz</b>
      </p>
      <p>Thank you and good morning, everyone. This is Kim Golodetz with LHA. Welcome to Celsion's Corporations conference call to discuss its third quarter 2019 financial results.

      <p>
        <b>Michael Tardugno</b>
      </p>
      <p>Thank you, Kim. And good morning everyone. Joining me today are Jeffrey Church, Celsion's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a review of Celsion's recent financial results in a few minutes. Also on the call for the Q&amp;A portion are Dr. Nickolas Borys, our Chief Medical Officer, and I hope Dr. Khursheed Anwer, who is attending by cell phone. Dr. Khursheed Anwer, is on his way to an OVATION study and he is dialing in by cell phone. So Khursheed, we hope you stay connected. I'm going to apologize a little big I have a cold if you can hear it, so I will do my best here.</p>
      <p>It's always is a pleasure to be speaking with you particularly now as we approach the conclusive milestones made possible by the methodical and vigorous execution of our clinical development programs for ThermoDox and GEN-1. Today's call be mostly reassuring as most of our prepared remarks are in the public domain already. We're going to start with comments that I have been making regularly over the past year, possible but not probable. You heard me say that. This is been our guidance for the past year or so regarding the first interim analysis for our phase 3 optimums study. We also said that there is higher probability of success at the second interim analysis, while anticipated that by June of next year, just several short months from now. We standby that guidance, there is a higher probability and I will point it out to you in my remarks. I will once again remind you that our fundamentals are sound and overall you should expect no surprises form this management team.</p>
      <p>Our meetings with various regulatory agencies have resulted in no significant issues. Our manufacturing strategy is solid, our product cost is enviable. Our clinical trial strategy is unquestioned by the experts, our spending and cash management has been tight and focused, there are two investigational products both have blockbuster market potential by any standard of measure. Recent positive recommendations from the independent data monitoring committee or DMC and the independent data safety monitoring board or DSMB for both are optimized innovation two studies, respectively, are underpinned by solid cash position. A position that is sufficient to support an operating runway into the first quarter of 2021. I will also note that additional developments are expected during this time period that could be transformative for the company. Jeff will cover our current cash position, our financing strategy and our ability to access funds in more detail during his report on this call.</p>
      <p>I want to acknowledge front that our stock is been under some undue pressure, I suggest that defies reason. There is a great deal of misinformation out there as some of you probably know some purposely posted, I suspect some misunderstanding and speculation mostly but I offer you this that your best source of information on Celsion in our trials comes from the company and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, our quarterly conference calls in our press releases. I will remind you that 2020 is the potential to be the pivotal year for Celsion.</p>
      <p>I will make formal remarks, I like to cover for important things. The most important of which is number four will elaborate is then that is there our commitment to shareholder value. So let me start with the first one, I would like to say again we are well-positioned to achieve our objectives. We have the resources relationships personnel technology manufacturing capability in the capital that continue to deliver as we have been doing over the past few years. Our product candidates are directed to large and underserved markets repeated our lead drug candidates to excellent commercial, potential.</p>
      <p>Second our clinical studies are showing promise, as we announced on November 4, the first interim review by the data monitoring committee of the unblinded safety and survival data from the optimal study resulted in a unanimous recommendation that the study continue according to protocol. You could see, as I said earlier, this is a recommendation that we had expected. We believe also that the company blinded pull data are predictive of the successful study. I view as that you have to purposely ignore the signals the science and the published evidence to conclude otherwise. The data showed at full progression free survival for example, appears to be trekking identically if not better than TFS of the 285 patient each study subgroup group, a group that we followed prospectively for three years, we will explain that. This is not a retrospective subgroup coming from a prior study. This is a prospective group, it's a group that we identified following our research into the key driver of success of treating patients with radiofrequency ablation for ThermoDox. We now understand that to be a minimum of 45 minutes of RFA treatment in combination with ThermoDox. What we establish there preclinically.</p>
      <p>We then identified a group of patients were treated with a minimum of 45 minutes, a group of patients comprised of controller, and an active one, virtually half of patients were in the control arm, half of the patients were in the active arm. When we follow these patients for three years, every quarter for three years and we talked about it regularly, we had a quarterly press release.</p>
      <p>I think if you follow our progress with this group. You would know that this one large subgroup followed prospectively for three years, well balance, demonstrated median time to death of more than 7.5 years, that's curative by any standard of measure in oncology and more than two years of overall survival benefit over the RFA arm along. I will remind you that seraphic and other --inhibitors that are approved for advanced disease, advancing the HCC been improved with as little as 11 weeks survival. So the magnitude that affect by any standard measure is remarkable. These funds have been confirmed by the NIH and the review of the intent to treat population focusing on all single legion patients that's 432 single legion patients and they concluded that this is the manuscript its available to you that as you increase the heating time and add ThermoDox to the procedure survival improves significance. It's also been confirmed by various prospective preclinically potential studies and reinforce with data from liver cancer studies being conducted by the researchers at Oxford University in England. And it also supported with our own two phase 2 studies in breast cancer and so forth imaging there we recently issued a press release on the among other public's research.</p>
      <p>Once you read it all and its available on our website. The science, the medical results and the preclinical evidence are all compelling. Yes and I would venture even should allow me even to the skeptic members of the fireside society. We also recently reported that our phase 1, 2 OVATION study with general and the newly diagnosed patients with advanced disease that's a stage III and 4 overran cancer is gaining momentum after a very difficult startup and you know you been with us, there is been a challenge to get startup for a variety of reasons, most of which is a requirement, new requirement initiated stopped by the NIH, every investigator site have an independent review committee, biological review committee, which took a great deal of time to establish many of our sites. So that's a very difficult startup.</p>
      <p>We are now seeing enrollment rates that could very well be in line with if not better than our plan. Importantly, the independent data safety monitoring board recommended completing the phase 1 dose escalation portion of the study at the current dose which is 100 milligrams per meter squared after the review of the first eight patients randomized in the study. I'm happy to report that we now have a backlog of prospective patients in screening after the DSMB green light to continue. So obviously and we meet with them regularly, our investigators are excited about potential of GEN-1, potential for the trial as early and I hope. The third is our supply chain, and we're taking a necessary steps to insure robust and cost efficient supply chain for both GEN-1 and ThermoDox with multiple suppliers and redundant capacity.</p>
      <p>Gross margins as a function of price, but as a function of very competitive costs for gross margins for ThermoDox will be impressive no matter the market or the local economy. And remember, ThermoDox is being evaluated in HCC, HCC hepatocellular carcinoma is a primarily a disease of the Southeast Asia China, countries where disposable income is quite modest. So keeping our cost down is extremely important to successful commercial launch. So I expect our gross margins on average and we been saying this should be very close to 90s if not in the 90s when you look at weighted average gross margin forgo [ph].</p>
      <p>GEN-1 our interleukin 12 gene-mediated immunotherapy after an industrial tech [ph] transfer will be manufactured at a fraction of the cost of a replacement based drugs. This is important our patient treated with GEN-1 receive as much as placement is all of the other patients combined in the world, believe it or not 17 doses of 100 milligrams per meter squared is an enormous amount of plasmid. So getting the cost down in order to have an effective promotional strategy along with gross margin is important, our company focused on it from the beginning and we are not completing our tech transfer. And I will remind you, we done the high quality low-cost supply chain is critical for optics pharma to evaluate and consider as consider a license opportunity.</p>
      <p>Now on number four; commitment to shareholder value. I would say if you been following us its compromise -- with conducing successful trials is our focus on non-diluted and uncomplicated sources of finance. We work hard to establish a claim cap, structure convertible interest instruments like that can be used to leverage a short position. We are great deal to adjust church sitting on my right here for his excellent negotiation to retire our warrants through a very creative the stock exchange. And we know that that stock was used to cover short position. Last I look the short interest in the company is less than 0.5% less than 1% is that remarkable, I challenge you look for other microcaps biotech companies with that kind of trust reported short position. And the positive side, we renewed our common stock equity facility with this part of capital in late October on the some misunderstanding about this line, let me try to clear it up, this new line is for $10 million. That compares with the $15 million line that we cancel, import replaces the $50 million online.</p>
      <p>It's important to know that Celsion's hit our sole discretion controls the timing and the amount of stock that will be issued under this agreement and our intention is to use this facility judiciously and it's a major needs to fund the company. We will use it judiciously and evaluate the market conditions, if they are not right then we do not intent to use it. This deal is both effective and offensive and is constructive as one of many tools Jeff will talk about these that we will imply to avoid the toxic got spiral financings that are all too common and all too typical and the microchip biotech space. We don't want to and you don't want us to enter into heavily discounted financings with heavy warmth coverage as we have seen recently be the norm for the microcaps biotech sector and look at deals over the last 18 months as we have, heavily discounted, heavy warrants.</p>
      <p>Last, but not least; I want to clear up something in our use of debt. I believe we use our debt very smartly to leverage your equity investment, uncomplicated venture, interest only for the first number of years. The repayment of this debt is fully accounted for in our spending plans. We ended the quarter with 19 million in cash on the balance sheet and we look forward to adding another 4 million through the sale of her New Jersey net operating losses, including 2 million in the current quarter, we will more than enough cash through the important value drivers well into 2021. I got to say we're delighted to be a part of the New Jersey bio and biotechnology, pharmaceutical environment, we know that the New Jersey to cradle civil position for the pharmaceutical industry, other willingness to provide this kind of incentive for companies like ours to sell and net operating losses ahead of their commercial capability is been very good for the company and certainly good for shareholders.</p>
      <p>The last point I would like to make is that the support from international thought leaders should be reassuring to you. We continue to receive support from key opinion leaders and global leaders in their fields of medicine are largely focused in liver cancer, ovarian cancer requests for support for their trials of ThermoDox. GEN-1 our numerous we sort through them regularly. We have a number of activities going on with the variety of researchers, their interest in ThermoDox driven our results of the mechanism of action, the capability that has to deal effectively with a solid tumors is very heartening. Another example of their interested in presenting ThermoDox to the medical collogues is an example, we recently cosponsored a symposium focused on HCC at the conference of the International Liver Cancer Association in September. This symposium included two preeminent researchers in HCC including assignable offer of the more strong Kettering and Professor [indiscernible] from the University of Pisa is the preeminent burden radiofrequency ablation for HCC. The program I was there was well attended, a lot of great questions focusing on the future treatment options for HCC and now this is a very underserved indication very, very difficult to deal with the promise of ThermoDox is explored quite thoroughly. We also want that these kinds of medical education programs that can provide us with a template for introducing ThermoDox.</p>
      <p>Once the data is available to us prior to formal market authorization, so quickly quite a bit from this and intend to use it once the positive data from the trial. I will now turn to the positive news regarding the recommendation from the DNC from the optimal study following a review of the alignment data to the first prespecified intern efficacy analysis, the committee unanimously recommended that we continue the study as planned for this analysis, the DNC review data following 128 patient deaths, which occurred early in August 2019. The committee found no evidence of futility or safety issues of concern is 556 patient study.</p>
      <p>As I mentioned, what is particularly encouraging is that PFS events are tracking virtually identically, the 285 patient prospective subgroup seen in our earlier heat study, heat study trial did not succeed the subgroup will receive 45 minutes more parfait with ThermoDox, say it again, demonstrated to your overall survival advantage immediate time to death of more than 18 months. I want to emphasize that the bar for success for OPTIMA study to final analysis is only 70% of this survival benefit. So we have a great deal of margin here to conclude that our study would be successful. It's a far lower bar for success when compared to the prospective subgroup. I'll talk about the hazard ratios in a minute. Although we did not meet the required hazard ratio at the first interim analysis, the company data did provide the following information. One, the OPTIMA study patient demographics and risk factors are consistent with the company observed in the prospective subgroup with data quality metrics meeting expectations so it's very important. Controlling the study -- high quality study globally has been a life commitment here for clinical operations team and Dr. Boris and with the life and with the quality metrics.</p>
      <p>Number two, that the median PFS for overall -- for the OPTIMA study reached 17.3 months. This blinded the pool data compare favorably to the pool data from the prospect of subgroup which showed a 16.8-month median kind of progression.</p>
      <p>Number three, the rate of patient deaths for the OPTIMA study appears to be tracking well with the HEAT study perspective subgroup. As we suspected, however, overall survival from the OPTIMA study was not sufficiently mature to draw any conclusions. The study had a median follow up the OPTIMA study events. Had a median follow up of 25 months where's the comparative perspective subgroup had immediate follow up of 67 months. So I just give you a little suggestion here. If you'd like the capital marketer for the prospective subgroup of 25 patients is published in the manuscript that's on our website. I encourage you to take a look, judge for yourself where a meaningful separation occurs.</p>
      <p>Number four, the OPTIMA study has lost fully for patients to follow up. So about less than 2% of a patient per year. This kind of follow up suggests -- and by the way, the study was designed with an allowance for 3% loss per year. And this is to suggest to us that patients and investigators believe in the study's potential and their commitment is what's important to us in order to be able to properly evaluate the results for the trial. So our next pre-planned efficacy analysis will occur following a minimum of 158 patient events. The hazard ratio for success at 158 is 0.7. This compares favorably again to the observed -- the hazard ratio that was observed for the prospective subgroup. If you look at the Kaplan Meier analysis that's on our website in our corporate presentation, that hazard ratio is 0.65. So for success at the next interim hazard ratio is 0.7.</p>
      <p>And I'll also point out that the P values are consistent with what we believe or gives it odds on chance for the second in terms to be successful. The P-value for the perspective subgroup was 0.02. The P-value allowed for it to be successful and the second interim is 0.024. So we have some margin here both with the hazard ratio and the P-value. But you conclude that there is a potential here for success at the next interim. We call it the largest incidence of HCC occurs in China, with more than 400,000 new cases diagnosed there each year. As I mentioned on the last call, the Chinese authorities have expressed an interest and I have indicated in patients. It is my view. I'm finding the means to accelerate the data from the ThermoDox trial.</p>
      <p>This was stated during a meeting with Dr. Boris in 2016. We followed up. They asked us if there was a means to be able to evaluate the data center. We followed up this past October. I think it was October 23. The company met with the director for the Center for Drug Evaluation at the International Medical Products administration or the NPA, formerly known as the CFDA. We met with the director of CDE and her team. With respect to the possibility of unwinding the OPTIMA trial after the first interim after we've seen the analysis. They indicated the data maturity was not sufficient to support accelerated or conditional approval at that time. But they did indicate a preference to consider the data from the second interim analysis, which we think is encouraging.</p>
      <p>Even more encouraging was a suggestion that they made that the company should consider a compassionate use program in China. We see this as a positive. We certainly do and are making plans under Dr. Boris' direction to launch a program in high volume high-quality clinical sites to participate in the OPTIMA study could stop saying the compassionate use program given what we know and the potential to provide patients with a very unique opportunity to extend their lives.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, as I mentioned last quarter, we are continuing work on the NDA for the ThermoDox and HCC. The goal is to position us to be able to file quickly once we get positive data. I can report to you and for those of you who are our NDA walkies, module 2 and 3 are nearly completed. In summary we're very excited about the potential of ThermoDox and believe this could be an exceptionally valuable asset as more data are generated probably for HCC but for other solid attempts. While ThermoDox and OPTIMA have immediate interest for some and probably most investors at this point, we believe that GEN-1 holds an equally compelling promise. Earlier in development, GEN-1 is being evaluated in the Phase I/II OVATION 2 study of newly diagnosed treatment late-stage ovarian cancer patients. Patients are stage 3 and 4 totally with a malignancy that is a heavy tumor burden that fills their belly.</p>
      <p>They're typically treated with new regimen chemotherapy prior to surgery in our study OVATION 2 following OVATION 1 which is similar in nature. In this study we treat patients with GEN-1 in combination with chemotherapy prior to surgery. And after surgery, we'll continue to treat them with GEN-1. The goal of which is to delay progression. OVATION 2 is a randomized PHASE I/II study designed to evaluate safety of up to one portion -- Phase I portion. Up to 100 milligrams per meter squared should have the answer to that before the end of the year that's followed by continuation of the selected dose we now believe that will be under 100 milligrams per meter squared. Phase 2 is an open-label one to one randomized trial. Obvious open-label we're allowed as the investigators become confident that the report data from the trial we're happy to do that.</p>
      <p>The GEN-1 is designed using our proprietary TheraPlas platform technology. That's comprised of an interleukin 12 DNA plasmid and we associate it with our lipopolymeric nanoparticle delivery system TheraPlas. This nanoparticle enables the cell to be transfected with the DNA plants resulting in a persistent local regional secretion of the cytokines or the inflammatory protein IL 12. We know that IL 12 protein to be a potent anti-cancer recruiter of the entire immune system to fight malignancies. However, the reason I believe it can be [Technical Difficulty] ovarian cancer. Last week we reported to the independent data seeking monitoring board. The SMB as I was calling it. Completed its safety review from data from the first 8 patients enrolled in the Phase 1 portion of what will be 138 patients total. Based on the unanimous recommendation is very continuous as planned and we proceed with completing enrollment in Phase 1 portion of the trial. The remaining patients in this portion of the trial will continue to receive the current 200 milligrams per meter squared of GEN-1. Then we should have a minimum of 6 patients in the control arm and 6 patients in the GEN-1 arm by year end. That's our target.</p>
      <p>Following that we will be reporting data, surgical outcomes and objective response rates followed by translational data once the tissue samples from these patients have been interrogated by researchers at Roswell Park Cancer Institute. At this point, we have 16 Africa sites. Expect up to 25 sites up and running in January in the United States and we will add 2 more in Canada for a total of 28 sites to recruit patients. Our goal is to complete enrollment by the end of next year. And we are very hopeful that we can do that particularly given the backlog that we've seen immediately once reopening the trial in the Phase 1 portion.</p>
      <p>The study is powered to show a 33% improvement of PFS which is the primary endpoint. When comparing GEN-1 with the standard of care to the standard of care alone on the PFS analysis will be conducted after at least 80 events have been observed or after all patients have been followed for at least 16 months, whichever is later. Also, patients in the GEN-1 arm as I mentioned earlier, will receive GEN-1 plus chemotherapy after their interval the barking surgery. Again, the goal here is to delay progression. Because we know when a patient progresses the prognosis is not that great. The first 2 portions we expect to begin in the first half of 2020.</p>
      <p>I conclude by saying we're very optimistic that GEN-1 will ultimately find its place in the treatment arsenal for curing cancer. It will be both competitive in the market place and a high margin product for us. With margin supply in mind, we also announced last week that we are finalizing our protect transfer effect we produced a lot. One first lot for clinical use from -- actually two lots from our global manufacturers Hisun Pharma and Hainan Poly Pharm in China. I mentioned our goal is to ensure an affordable treatment regardless of the market and the region. Once approved, the cost structure for Gen-1 is expected to support rapid market adoption and significant gross margins.</p>
      <p>Well, before I turn the call over to Jeff for his review of our third quarter financials, I want to emphasize that Celsion again, to our position are to deliver significant developments in the coming year, underpinning our fundamentals, strong balance sheet access to capital and a committed management team. We continue to expect to create significant value for our shareholders and patients in the medical community.</p>
      <p>And now, I'll turn it over to Jeff. Jeffrey?</p>
      <p>
        <b>Jeffrey Church</b>
      </p>
      <p>Thanks, Mike. Details of Celsion's third quarter 2019 financial results were included in the press release we issued yesterday evening and in our Form 10-Q which we filled last night after the market closed. As Mike stated, we made significant progress during the quarter in developing our lead products. Ongoing focus on efficient cash management will allow us to reach key milestones here for the near and intermediate term. As of September 30, 2019, Celsion's cash and investment balance was $18.8 million. In addition to plant sale of $4 million of New Jersey State NOLs this year and next, and the unused amounts available under our 2 existing equity facilities should allow us to extend our cash well into the first half of 2021. This timing will take us past the final end point of the Phase 3 OPTIMA study which is 197 events it needed.</p>
      <p>Our Cap table is very clean and includes approximately 22 million common shares outstanding and only 600,000 warrants. With respect to future funding flexibility, we have a $75 million shelf registration statement on file with the SEC to sell registered shares at the appropriate time. We also have 2 equity facility that allows us to raise capital in an opportunistic fashion with no warrants and a very low commission or fee. The first facility to $10 million common stock purchase agreement was to Spire Capital. You may have noticed they're filling with the SEC in which we recently amended this agreement. Note that we have registered 4.5 million shares under this agreement. The second facility is a traditional at the market equity line with Jones Trading. The use of either one of these facilities is under the complete control and discretion of the company.</p>
      <p>Now turning to the third quarter financial results. Celsion reported a net loss for the third quarter 2019 of $5.5 million or $0.25 per share, compared to a net loss of $4.7 million or $0.26 per share in the same period last year. Operating expenses were $5.5 million in the third quarter of 2019, which represented a $1.4 million increase from the $4 million in the same period of 2018. Specifically, research and development expenses were $3.7 million in the current quarter, up from $2.2 million a year ago. Clinical development costs for the Phase 3 OPTIMA study in the prior year was favorably impacted by an $800,000 one-time credit resulting from clock concessions negotiated with the study's lead CRO. Also contributing to the increase this year were high costs to support the anticipated global registration filings seminars, as well as higher costs associated with technology transfer of GEN-1 to new contract manufacturing organization. The goal of which is to significantly reduce our manufacturing costs.</p>
      <p>GEN-1 administrative expenses were $1.8 million in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $2 million in the same period of 2018. This decrease, which primarily attributed both to a $200,000 decline in non-cash stock compensation expense in the current quarter. During 2013, we recorded a gain of $86,000 from the reduction in the earn-out liability related to potential milestone payments. As we reported earlier this year we renegotiated the earn-out milestones applicable to the ovarian cancer indication resulting in a favorable impact on future milestone liability payments and cash flow. Celsion realized $200,000 of interest income from short term investments during the third quarter that compared to about $100,000 in interest income last year.</p>
      <p>In connection with the June 2018 venture debt facility with Horizon, we incurred interest excess of $400,000 during the third quarter of 2019, which is consistent with the interest we incurred last year for the same third quarter period. I'd like to remind you that the Horizon venture debt is interest only through the second quarter of 2020. Net cash used for operating activities in the first 9 months of 2019 was $14.6 million, which compares to $13.1 million used to fund operations in the comparable period in 2018. Total cash provided by financing activities was $1.7 million during the third quarter of 2019 and $6.2 million for the first 9 months of 2019, which included opportunistic sales through the 2 equity facilities I mentioned earlier.</p>
      <p>On October 1, we announced our application to sell additional New Jersey State Anna wells in the amount of $2 million to raise non-dilutive capital was approved by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority. We plan to complete the sale of these Anna wells prior to the end of the year. We anticipate that our net cash usage for the fourth quarter 2019 will be approximately $5 million. Our 2020 budget calls for keeping expenses and cash utilization at approximately $4 million per quarter. Our current cash together with additional NOL sale proceeds projected for 2019 and 2020 is expected to provide us with funds into the first half of 2021. In closing, we believe that a successful clinical outcome for ThermoDox in a billion-dollar commercial opportunity will result in significant value inflection for the company, as well as their shareholders.</p>

      <p>Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jason Kolbert with Dawson James.</p>
      <p>
        <b>JasonKolbert</b>
      </p>
      <p>Thank you so much. And by the way, thank you so much for supporting me and presenting, Jeff, down in Florida. You did a great job. There's been a lot of interest and we're actually very excited to be covering Celsion. Mike, you mentioned something that I just wanted to go back on which is the potential for success at the next interim analysis. That's very exciting. Can you expand upon that comment?</p>
      <p>
        <b>MichaelTardugno</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes, I think I can. I think giving all the signals are pointing in the right direction. I'd start first with the hazard ratio of 0.7, and the group seemed to be comparable, very comparable with other demographics, the OPTIMA group and the sub group that we planned this on. So the hazard ratio is somewhat better -- quite a bit better than the hazard ratio that we saw, I mean, better being it gives us a greater margin for success at 0.7 versus 0.65 from the sub group. The p-value, you know, we have a pretty tight p-value in these first interim looks in order to preserve alpha. The p-value that we saw with the subgroup was 0.02, the p-value a lot at the second interim analysis is 0.02. So there's a hurdle here for success that seems to us to be achievable, so we'd start there. When we look at the median kind of follow-up with the CaP1 markers in the published manuscript for the HEAT study, you see that at about 35-36 months that the separation becomes pretty significant, and that's about the time the median follow-up will be about that time for the second interim analysis. So we're assuming, of course, that nothing is dramatically changed with the controller. But everything seems to be moving in the right direction in that regard.</p>
      <p>I mean, we also have the other, you know, the other soft indicators. PFS looks to be tracking almost too perfectly with PFS in the subgroup. The best that we could tell, although it's immature survival made of deaths [ph] tracking reasonably well. The trend is following the subgroup, the best we can tell almost exactly. So, in any memory, the deaths that's recurring as almost the right on-track with the sucker [ph]. That gives us some confidence that this next look has greater potential to be successful, no guarantees, obviously, but much greater potential to be successful.</p>
      <p>
        <b>JasonKolbert</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mike, given the desperate need in China and kind of the state of health care reform there, you must be in very active discussions not only with the FDA, but with multiple partners in China. Can you talk a little bit about kind of what your senses of the market and the ability to do a BD deal related to China?</p>
      <p>
        <b>MichaelTardugno</b>
      </p>
      <p>It's a great question, you know, so we do have a lot of interest to get a lot of incoming from not only from the Chinese companies, but also from multinationals, just our business development person just came back from the Bio BBD conference from Europe with great deal of interest. There's regional interest in China, and the countries that are nearby is palpable. We haven't – and there is some ongoing diligence, I can tell you that. But, we haven't seen a deal structure -- the Chinese companies that would be -- we think would be appropriate for the multinationals.</p>
      <p>I think they're taking a little bit more of a wait and see attitude. They're doing intelligence, but it will be before there's any real movement. There's going to be the need for some positive data. But I can tell you this. If you open your medicine cabinet, you'd see the names of a lot of the companies that have asked for updates and signed confidentiality agreements with us.</p>

      <p>Thank you. We'll take our next question from Matthew Cross with Jones Trading.</p>
      <p>
        <b>MatthewCross</b>
      </p>
      <p>Congrats on the recent progress for both programs and thanks for taking my questions. Starting out with GEN-1, I've got a couple questions related to the upcoming readout from the OVATION 2 studies as you progressed through the phase one portion. First off, is there any guidance you can provide on approximately how many patients we should have response rate, surgical statistics that you're on at this time point and maybe an average of how many cycles of GEN-1 these patients will have received by that time? Or if it's something that will be described at the time of presentation?</p>
      <p>
        <b>MichaelTardugno</b>
      </p>
      <p>I'm going to ask Nick to jump in, it's going to be a minimalist foresight.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Nicholas Borys</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes, this is Nick Borys. In regards to the number of patients we'll be looking at, we're randomizing this study from the beginning. So, as Mike mentioned before, it's a one-to-one randomized design. So for the safety purposes, we will be looking at least six patients to confirm our 100 milligram per meter dose, and we'll be tracking our primary employ, which is progression free survival out from there. And the median time progression, at least in the biggest studies that we've seen until recently, would be about 12 months. So whether we have some PFS data at that point, might not be too much. However, one nice indicator to keep a look out to -- keep an eye on that we think is indicative is how many patients come out of surgery with no tumor in the margins, meaning there are zero effect. So we 100% R0 at our highest dose in the last study, which was 80 milligrams.</p>
      <p>In this study, we're looking at very good indicators again from the two patients, they got surgery, So that's something to keep an eye on when we make the announcement later on, at that first analysis, after the first 6 patients of 100 milligrams.</p>
      <p>
        <b>MichaelTardugno</b>
      </p>
      <p>If I could answer that, so we'll have our first look at it compared to group that large six and six, this comparative group, if it, you know, shows what we expect that GEN-1 is providing some advantage, we intend, as we mentioned earlier, called to share that information with the FDA when we are looking for ways to accelerate our program. And the agency has indicated to us in a teleconference meeting that they would be interested in try helping us find a way to do so.</p>
      <p>
        <b>MatthewCross</b>
      </p>
      <p>Perfect, that's great color. I appreciate it, Nick and Mike. And then, kind of a follow-up to that, as we're lining up these initial results with what was seen in OVATION- 1 clearly part of the promise of OVATION-2, is this evaluation of further maintenance doses of GEN-1, following regiment chemo, and I wouldn't expect you to really be too far into this portion of the protocol at the time of readout this quarter. So if you're treating with a higher 100 mg per meter square dose without really entering that maintenance period just yet, would you consider it fair to kind of more or less compare these initial results to those OVATION-1, apples to apples, of course, taking into account of these are still early insights, and as you just pointed out, just six patients in that group.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Nicholas Borys</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes, I think that's a great question. This is Nick Boris, again. Of course, we'd like to compare to what we saw in the OVATION-1 what we saw. I think we're pretty excited to see activity continuing on and GEN-1 contributing to that anti-tumor activity during the maintenance period. You know, I don't know if we emphasize enough that the drug really is very well tolerated by the patients, has minimal side effects, the DMC is very comfortable with that. And that seems to be a theme in immune-oncology right now with the new generation of medicines, and I'm very glad that GEN-1 is a part of that. So, we will be comparing the data. We'll probably learn a lot of what works well and what doesn't. And so it's going to be interesting data in the future, I agree.</p>
      <p>
        <b>MichaelTardugno</b>
      </p>
      <p>I should also say Matt that the tissue samples taken at baseline and during surgery will be sent to a Roswell Park for interrogation for, you know, immunohistochemistry data as well as blood and fluid samples. So, we'll be able to -- shortly thereafter, we should be able to report some translational data on these 12 patients.</p>
      <p>
        <b>MatthewCross</b>
      </p>
      <p>Great. Glad -- glad to hear it. Looking forward to that data. And glad to hear that things are -- that safety profile is still continuing to be quite well tolerated given that you're now increasing the dosage a little bit here, and I'm obviously glad to see that. If I can squeeze on one more quick one ThermoDox. Obviously, we're coming up to the next interim readout from OPTIMA, which is, as you've communicated and we would agree, appears to be the first likely opportunity to be successful. Could you give us an update on your take regarding commercialization of ThermoDox, maybe, kind of relation to some of the earlier questions? I guess you've spoken to the manufacturing efforts to entice large farmer licensing, but are you -- do you consider all options on the table specifically within the U. S market? Or do you expect you'd only be comfortable bringing ThermoDox to market here with a partner? Give me your guided, you know, having cash in the first half of 2021, I'm kind of wondering if that factors in scaling up a commercial team here in the States or that you know, this also maybe indicates you prefer not to go it alone here. China, obviously most likely a partner opportunity, as you've alluded to?</p>
      <p>
        <b>MichaelTardugno</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes, I can say with some confidence outside of the United States, we know what we're good at, and also are very conscious of what we're not. And marketing a product like ThermoDox outside of the United States would be a great challenge for a little company like ours. So our complete expectation is that ThermoDox would be licensed either to a single agent for the global market outside of the U.S. or regionally. And I think there's a regional probability here that could be very beneficial to shareholders in the company. For the United States, we're always going to do what's best for shareholders. I mean, I'm thinking -- we think we can be the best towards ThermoDox in the commercialization in the U.S. Market. But that requires capital and risk and some hiring challenges that always have some difficulty. And the Big Pharma is a machine, you know, when it comes to bringing a drug like this to market, particularly in underserved market, there is no competition. This is the first and only first line therapeutic for HCC. So on one hand, that makes it very attractive for us to think that that we could do this alone. On the other hand, I suspect it's going to be very attractive to a commercial partner. So our objective really is to do its best for shareholders. And if we get a good deal for the U.S., that certainly would be the focus of the company. Does it make sense?</p>
      <p>
        <b>MatthewCross</b>

      </p>
      <p>Thank you. We'll take our next question from Kumar Raja with Brookline Capital Markets.</p>
      <p>
        <b>KumarRaja</b>
      </p>
      <p>Thanks for taking my question. So with regard to the second interim analysis, obviously, I understand that it's going to be 158 events. So, it would be very similar in terms of that DSMV would be doing a blinded analysis and based on their findings, they would decide whether to unblind the study or continue further. That's the expectation there?</p>
      <p>
        <b>MichaelTardugno</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes, so it's the DMC. So the DMC has access to unblinded data, Kumar. So they will be looking at the tables, listings, and graphs for every unblinded study along with a number of different slices that they like to look at, in order to determine the success of the beta trial. So they get a complete and comprehensive data set. So there, I mean, and that's Dr Boris' point of view. So we need to give them everything that we could possibly believe that's important to make a good decision, with regards to unblinding a study. Because it was assumed that they do recommend unblinding study, we want to be in a position to be able to present all of this information which eventually will be acquired by the FDA. And they're going to be looking for us to slice and dice on a number of things regionally, by sight, by gender, I mean, that's just kind of work that they do, or by tumor size.</p>
      <p>So, we want to be prepared to present to the agency a sufficient data set to make sure that we can go forward without question.</p>
      <p>
        <b>KumarRaja</b>
      </p>
      <p>And in terms of the alpha spend, what was the alpha spend in the first versus the second. And also in terms of the insight from the first interim analysis are in line. Are they all in line with the expectation in terms of what all data you were able to access and analyze.</p>
      <p>
        <b>MichaelTardugno</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes, so the alpha spend is very, very small, I think because we got unblinding the study and we're using this land the Lan and DeMets approach, in line with that, in the end that we will have something like 0.45 spending -- alpha spending available to us. So between the two, I don't know how it breaks down at the top of my head; but between the two our spending is -- the hit is quite small. We can get you the detail on that separately and happy to make it available to anyone.</p>
      <p>
        <b>KumarRaja</b>
      </p>
      <p>And in terms of GEN-1 have you had any further interactions with the FDA since you updated last?</p>
      <p>
        <b>MichaelTardugno</b>
      </p>
      <p>I'm sorry, could you repeat that?</p>
      <p>
        <b>KumarRaja</b>
      </p>
      <p>Have you had any further interactions with the FDA with regard to GEN-1 since the last update last quarter?</p>
      <p>
        <b>MichaelTardugno</b>
      </p>
      <p>Not since the last quarter. I think what we reported then on the last call is that we had a -- we submitted a briefing document to the agency largely focused on how can we -- given the promise and the data that we saw in the Phase 1 portion, is there an opportunity for us to accelerate this program, either through breakthrough designation or otherwise? And what we reported at that time, it's not too long ago when we had that meeting. Is it July? The agency, I think we reported what was supposed to be a 30-minute call turned into almost an hour. In their first opening [indiscernible] to us with this. They're very excited. They're very encouraged. They want us to continue. They've asked us to -- the only outlier here is they'd like to see some competitor information in their control so control. So we asked that we get back to them once we have some data from the current study with the comparative control arm so we're looking forward to that. As soon as we can show some comparison data from this study we'll summarize it with the data that we sent to them previously and I'm sure they'd be ready to take another call for us.</p>
      <p>
        <b>KumarRaja</b>
      </p>
      <p>And with regard to the investigator's sponsored trials in breast cancer in Netherlands, any updates on the trial and in terms of data when can we expect to see some data from the trial?</p>
      <p>
        <b>MichaelTardugno</b>
      </p>
      <p>So far the breast cancer study, for the most part, in the interest of conserving cash, we have put that on halt. I think the company is not in a position to fund much more than we're currently talking about. We have a number of investigator sites in Europe, who would be delighted to move forward but right now it's a cash resource and we're not prepared to raise capital to fund that research at this point.</p>
      <p>
        <b>KumarRaja</b>
      </p>
      <p>Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions.</p>
      <p>
        <b>MichaelTardugno</b>
      </p>
      <p>I'm sorry, Nick has another comment on that. I'm sorry, you want to talk about Utrecht?</p>
      <p>
        <b>NicholasBorys</b>
      </p>
      <p>I think you mentioned the Netherlands which I believe might have indicated you were interested in the progress at Utrecht, which is an investigator-driven study in breast cancer. And so that's moving on. They have a very long administrative in the IRB process, but I think they've gotten all their approvals. They recently sent me a notification that they're looking to begin recruiting patients early in the New Year. So we're pretty excited about that as well. As you know, this is involving high intensity focused ultrasound therapy with ThermoDox. There has been very interesting clinical data and a great indication for breast cancer. So hopefully in new year you'll be hearing more.</p>
      <p>

      <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Jackie Yin with Oppenheimer.</p>
      <p>
        <b>JackieYin</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hi Michael, this is Jackie on the call today. Thanks for taking my questions. Could you maybe talk a little bit more about the compassionate use in China? And any faster market strategy there in China?</p>
      <p>
        <b>MichaelTardugno</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes, this second, compassionate use program I think is exciting as it gets -- So what we have is an installed base of investigators. I believe it's 16 sites that were active in the OPTIMA study. Virtually every site provided patients to the trial. On one site we're going to happen so we probably won't encode them. But 15, 16 sites in -- we're going to take a small role on this because we want to make sure that if the drug is being used properly, but you want to mention how we're going to -- Nick Borys will talk to you a little bit more about how we plan to move forward with the compassionate use program.</p>
      <p>
        <b>NicholasBorys</b>
      </p>
      <p>This is a brand new program in China. I think they're learning from the U.S. and European experience on this. And interestingly, going to the meeting with Mike, few weeks ago in China, one of our investigators was with us and she brought up the need for compassionate use of the drugs. So the regulators followed her lead and recommended to us that we do compassionate work. So we're looking to, as Mike said, start small, look at work with the investigators, see what populations that they have with most benefit from ThermoDox use with their RFA. So we're going to take very deliberate steps on this. Work closely with the regulators. Again, this is a new program in China so we want to make sure it gets done correctly. We'll be collecting a lot of good safety information. We'll probably see potential areas of other interests with the investigators who have used our drug. And so it's hard to predict right now what kind of patients we'll be getting or how long it's going to take but we're going to make very deliberate efforts in that direction.</p>
      <p>
        <b>JackieYin</b>
      </p>
      <p>That's helpful. For the filing strategy, should we expect that you're going to file ThermoDox in China before you file in the U.S?</p>
      <p>
        <b>MichaelTardugno</b>
      </p>
      <p>So that's been our strategy and it will continue to be. It's going to be largely on the strength of the data, Jack. So the stronger the data, the more opportunity we have to get a -- have a strategy that involves China first. So in our discussions with the Chinese authorities, they know that our plan is to file an NDA. They actually, as I mentioned with 2 modules strengths, 2 and 3 are virtually complete. Filing an NDA with a common technical document it's not that difficult anymore to file globally in a relatively short period of time but at the moment it's China first followed by the U.S. and then the European MAA filing.</p>
      <p>
        <b>JackieYin</b>
      </p>
      <p>Got it. Maybe if we switch gear to GEN-1, any update on the scale in work being done with GEN-1? If there are any specific processes you can comment or refine further to improve our point of view?</p>
      <p>
        <b>MichaelTardugno</b>
      </p>
      <p>Refining what I'm sorry?</p>
      <p>
        <b>JackieYin</b>
      </p>
      <p>Any scale in work had been done for GEN-1 like from Phase 1 to Phase 2?</p>
      <p>
        <b>MichaelTardugno</b>
      </p>
      <p>Scaling work from a trial design standpoint?</p>
      <p>
        <b>JackieYin</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes.</p>
      <p>
        <b>MichaelTardugno</b>
      </p>
      <p>The trial design it's powered to show a 33% improvement. And I think we're -- the P here is Point 1 in the Phase 2 study. So we're looking at 130 patients so going from literally 16 patients to 130 patients, half of whom will be in a control arm and the other half of that in the therapeutic arm. What we'd like to be able to do if we're out of hearts here is if we have some positive data and the agency agrees is just to expand this trial so that we have enough power to assume it's a registration study.</p>
      <p>
        <b>JackieYin</b>
      </p>
      <p>Got it. The last one is how often should we expect updates from the open label Phase 2 portion of GEN-1?</p>
      <p>
        <b>MichaelTardugno</b>
      </p>
      <p>If it follows the way we presented data from the Phase 1 study as soon as the investigators are comfortable with the results, the surgical results, the tumor responses and some of the other markers like CA125 and the like. As soon as we have that information and the investigators are confident we present it. So throughout the course of the years -- it's likely to come in groups so that there's enough comparative information that the investors and analysts like yourself can begin to draw some conclusions.</p>
      <p>
