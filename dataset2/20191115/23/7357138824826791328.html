      <h1>SEC Probing WeWork For Potential Violations Around Failed IPO</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T23:40:26+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 23:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pymnts.com/author/pymnts/" target="_blank">PYMNTS</a></address>
      <p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reportedly looking into <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/tag/wework/">WeWork</a> to determine whether the embattled company violated financial rules while it was gearing up for its IPO, according to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-15/wework-is-said-to-face-sec-inquiry-into-possible-rule-violations?srnd=premium">Bloomberg</a>.</p>
      <p>The SEC’s enforcement arm is examining the company’s disclosures to investors amid reports of conflicts of interest and questionable fundraising practices, which are also under scrutiny.</p>
      <p>Prompted by the inquiry, WeWork has hired Andrew Ceresney, the former SEC enforcement unit head who now works in private practice on Wall Street.</p>
      <p>There has yet to be any official allegations against WeWork. The company has had a startling <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/ipo/2019/wework-officially-shelves-ipo/">change of fortunes</a> lately, as it was once valued at $47 billion and was considered one of the darlings of the tech sector.</p>
      <p>The company removed its CEO Adam Neumann in September and decided not to move forward with its IPO. It is now valued at under $8 billion.</p>
      <p>Part of the concern is that when the company turned in its S-1, a filing that comes before an IPO, the company said its losses were growing at the same pace as its sales, and sometimes even faster.</p>
      <p>As for the perceived conflicts, <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/personnel/2019/wework-neumann-to-relinquish-ceo-role/">Neumann</a> was making money as a private landlord leasing to his own company. Also, when the company changed its name to We Co., it bought the “we” trademark for $5.9 million from a company that was controlled by Neumann.</p>
      <p>Even the company’s leadership was set up in an unconventional way. WeWork listed Neumann’s wife, Rebekah, as one of the people with the power to pick a new CEO.</p>
      <p>WeWork’s accounting practices, including the way it calculates metrics, is also being investigated. The company would use something called a “community-adjusted Ebitda,” which was in early S-1 filings but was eventually pulled.</p>
