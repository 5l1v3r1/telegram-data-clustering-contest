      <h1>‘Curb Your Enthusiasm’ star Jeff Garlin was almost fired from ‘The Goldbergs’</h1>

      <p>“The Goldbergs” star Jeff Garlin says he was almost fired from the ABC sitcom this year after people complained about his language on the set.</p>
      <p>Garlin, who plays gruff family patriarch Murray Goldberg on the ’80s-era series set in Pennsylvania, was called into HR. The issue? His colorful language between takes.</p>
      <p>“I was saying some really stupid silly things that I can’t believe that anyone would find offensive, but to each his own,” Garlin, 57, tells The Post.</p>
      <p>“Every time I stand up [on the set] I go, ‘Oh, my [female genitalia].’ Which is silly and stupid, I clearly don’t have [female genitalia]. And I said to them, ‘I understand if I worked at an insurance office and there’s a bunch of desks — that’s inappropriate. But in a comedic atmosphere it’s stupid. They said, ‘What if we fire you?’ and I said, ‘I’d love to have it announced Jeff Garlin got fired for saying [that].’ ”</p>
      <p>Garlin emerged with his role intact. His standup special, “Our Man in Chicago,” is now on Netflix, and Season 10 of “Curb Your Enthusiasm” drops in January.</p>
      <p>“I was filming ‘The Goldbergs’ at the same time that I was filming ‘Curb Your Enthusiasm,’ and at night I would go out and work on my standup set,” says Garlin about how he spent this spring and summer. “Right now I’m taking a little break from standup just because I need to re-energize myself.”</p>
      <p>“Our Man in Chicago,” filmed in June in Garlin’s native city at the Park West theater, closes out in an unusual way — with Garlin addressing the camera, telling the audience at home to watch fellow comedian John Mulaney’s special. Garlin says he did it because he doesn’t view Mulaney as his competition.</p>
      <p>“He’s the opposite of the competition. He’s somebody that brings me great joy,” he says. “I feel like people should know about him if they don’t. They would get a lot of joy from watching his special.”</p>
      <p>On Jan. 19, he returns for Season 10 of “Curb Your Enthusiasm” as Jeff Greene, Larry’s (Larry David) manager and close friend who’s still married to foul-mouthed Susie (Susie Essman) despite his philandering.</p>
      <p>Garlin says that, after all these years, his working relationship with David is seamless. “When we shoot a scene where it’s just Larry and me, it goes quickly, because we know how to work with each other so well,” he says.</p>
      <p>“[Season 10] is my favorite season we’ve ever done. The premise is, to me, the funniest and smartest premise that we’ve done,” he says. “It’s something that everybody will be able to associate with.”</p>
      <p>People constantly approach Garlin to ask about what David is really like — and Garlin says that’s fine with him.</p>
      <p>“It doesn’t bother me, because I’d want to know, too,” he says. “I say he’s a great guy, and I love him.”</p>
