      <p>A dad was stunned after he bought a 'Twirl' chocolate bar which had three fingers.</p>
      <p>Samuel May bought the Orange Twirl for 49p expecting there to be two bars inside.</p>
      <p>When he unwrapped the bar - which did appear slightly larger than usual from the outside - he found it had a staggering three fingers inside.</p>
      <p>The miraculous '50% more chocolate than expected' moment came at the end of a lengthy hunt for a particular bar by Sam.</p>
      <p>The man, from Swindon, Wiltshire, said: "I’d been looking for these Orange Twirls for ages. Me and my partner absolutely love chocolate but we couldn’t find them anywhere.</p>

      <p>"They were by the tills when I got there. So I was quite excited to have found them and I picked up a couple for me and my partner.</p>
      <p>"I was looking at them and thought ‘that one is a bit bigger than the other’.</p>
      <p>"I was just holding it and could feel there were in fact three fingers in it. One on top of the other two. It’s mad isn’t it?</p>
      <p>"I feel like I just can’t believe it. I can’t find these bars for ages and then pick first one up and it’s got three fingers in.''</p>

      <p>The 27-year-old is not sure what he’ll do with the third stick of chocolate, but is currently considering sharing it with his youngest daughter, Nalah.</p>
      <p>He said: "I’ve got an eight-month-old who likes sucking on chocolate at the moment so I may give it to her to enjoy. It’s just one of those funny things.</p>
      <p>"It would be nice if it was the only one in the world. Hopefully there’s more good luck to come, now is a good time to buy a lottery ticket.''</p>

      <p>A spokeswoman for Cadbury said: “The reaction to the launch of Cadbury Twirl Orange has been incredible and the product is in very high demand across the country.</p>
      <p>"This guy has hit the jackpot by finding three fingers in a rare limited-edition Orange Twirl.</p>
      <p>"We can’t promise there will be any more to come.”</p>
