      <p>What better way to target a large amount of victims, then to go after providers with numerous customers, which is what we saw this week when SmarterASP.net was hit by the Snatch Ransomware and a new ransomware called NextCry specifically targets the NextCloud file sharing solution.</p>
      <p>The other big story this week was the DoppelPaymer attack on Mexico's Pemex state-owned oil company, where the attacked demanded approximately $4.9 million USD.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, it has mostly been new variants of existing ransomware such as Dharma and STOP Djvu. </p>

      </h4>
      <p>I looked at our server files and saw they had been encrypted. We knew immediately it was ransomware. In every place a file was encrypted, a ransom note was dropped in. We had millions of encrypted files – and the threat actors started encrypting our backups. In hindsight, my military background helped me prepare for this. My telecommunications work started in the U.S. Army. I served two tours of Iraq and spent time in Korea. I'm trained to keep a level head and problem solve one issue at a time. Of course it's a different type of battleground, but I knew this would be reconnaissance.</p>

      <p>Ransomware has been around for decades, yet it remains a common and lucrative cyberthreat. We decided to take a closer look at the behaviour of ransomware once it is inside a victim system, and how the various tools and techniques observed are used by the most prevalent ransomware families, from WannaCry, Matrix and GandCrab to Ryuk, SamSam, MegaCortex, and more. This article is a summary of a report we’re releasing today, <a href="https://www.sophos.com/en-us/medialibrary/PDFs/technical-papers/sophoslabs-ransomware-behavior-report.pdf">How Ransomware Attacks: What defenders should know about the most prevalent and persistent ransomware families.</a></p>

      <h4>New NextCry Ransomware Encrypts Data on NextCloud Linux Servers</h4>
      <p>A new ransomware has been found in the wild that is currently undetected by antivirus engines on public scanning platforms. Its name is NextCry due to the extension appended to encrypted files and that it targets clients of the NextCloud file sync and share service.</p>
