      <p>Sophia Di Martino is in talks for a co-starring role in Disney+'s <b>Loki</b> show, according to <i><a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/loki-sophia-di-martino-tom-hiddleston-marvel-1203406777/">Variety</a></i>. The actor reportedly beat out several other actors in what the Hollywood trade called a "highly contested" part.</p>
      <p>Di Martino was last seen in the film <i>Yesterday</i>, but shares a connection with <b>Loki</b> star Tom Hiddleston in that they both appeared on the BBC One hospital drama <i>Casualty</i> - albeit two years apart.</p>
      <p><b>Loki</b> is scheduled to debut in 2021 on Disney+.</p>
