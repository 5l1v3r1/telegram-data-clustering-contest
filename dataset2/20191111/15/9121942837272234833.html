      <p>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) — Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has launched a jobs program largely based on tax reductions as the country struggles to put more than 12 million people back to work.</p>
      <p>Brazil’s pension and labor secretary said Monday that the administration aims to create 1.8 million jobs for people ages 18-29 and almost 1 million other jobs by the end of 2022.</p>
      <p>The jobs package comes amid stubborn double-digit unemployment as well as violent protests elsewhere in South America, including Chile, stemming partly from economic difficulties.</p>
      <p>Labor secretary Rogério Marinho says labor costs for employers will fall as much as 34% with the program for young people. Other measures include microcredit and flexibility to work holidays and Sundays.</p>
      <p>The rules are already valid, but Brazil’s Congress must ratify them.</p>
