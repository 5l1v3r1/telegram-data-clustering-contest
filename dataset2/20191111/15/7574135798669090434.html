      <p>Tributes to Silver Jews/Purple Mountains frontman <b>David Berman</b> have <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/josh-ritter-jeffrey-lewis-michael-shannon-more-playing-david-berman-tribute-in-brooklyn/">continued</a> to <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/listen-to-david-berman-tribute-lp-ft-dean-wareham-adam-green-jeffrey-lewis-more/">pour</a> in since <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/mountain-goats-kevin-morby-members-of-the-national-belle-sebastian-more-pay-tribute-to-david-berman/">his death in August</a>. Many have been from fellow musicians, but on Sunday (11/10), Nashville NFL team The <b>Tennessee Titans</b> paid tribute at their game against Kansas City by putting “Nashville (and the world) will always love David Berman! 1967-2019″ on the Jumbotron. That’s a pic above.</p>
      <p>Berman moved to Nashville in 1999, which was the same year the Tennessee Titans debuted (they were previously the Houston Oilers, then the Tennessee Oilers), and lived there till last year. He was an avid Titans fan.</p>
      <p>In other news, Berman’s great book of poetry, <a href="https://www.dragcity.com/products/actual-air"><i>Actual Air,</i></a> is back in print in both physical and digital formats.</p>
