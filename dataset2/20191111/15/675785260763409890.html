      <h1>Archaeologists 'find 17th century underground casino' in Russia</h1>
      <h2>Gambling was outlawed in Russia in the 17th century with those caught either flogged or they had their ears cut off</h2>

      <p>Archaeologists have discovered what they believe is an underground casino in Russia, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Gambling was outlawed in Russia in the 17th century, so people are thought to have come up with a way of taking part in the pastime underground.</p>
      <p>Those caught gambling were either flogged or had their ears cut off, so they came up with elaborate tricks.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/arheologpskov/?utm_source=ig_embed">Archaeological Centre of  Pskov region</a> , scientists unearthed a wooden bench about 385 miles west of Moscow.</p>
      <p>The bench had a game called alquerque carved into it, the archaeologists believe.</p>
      <p>The game, which was like an early version of draughts, was popular in Russia during that period.</p>

      <p>If a raid took place, people would simply sit down on the bench, ruining the game but saving them from prosecution.</p>
      <p>Excavators have also found pieces of the game in recent years.</p>
      <p>In a statement a spokesman for the Archaeological Centre of  Pskov region said: "The fact is that in the reign of Alexei Mikhailovich gambling was forbidden and severely punished.</p>
      <p>"Players had to go into all sorts of tricks to hide their addiction.</p>
      <p>"Last year we found a lot of chips for the game, and now - one more proof of the diverse pastime of the Pskov people."</p>

      <p>Russians still enjoy gambling although many have admitted being addicts.</p>
      <p>Back in 2009 Vladimir Putin banned casinos across the country's cities, and forcing them to remote regions in Siberia, the Far East, the Kaliningrad Baltic Sea exclave and in southern Russia.</p>
      <p>Unions claimed that more than half a million jobs were lost with the casinos closures.</p>
      <p>Putin's government say the number was more like 60,000 jobs.</p>
