      <p>(CNN) - When 5-year-old Charlie Skabelund called 911, he had what you could call a serious emergency for a little boy: he needed a McDonald's Happy Meal.</p>
      <p>What he didn't expect was for Officer Randolph "Scott" Valdez of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MesaAzPD/photos/a.197458856934406/2946832598663671/?type=3&amp;theater">Mesa, Arizona, Police Department</a> to come to his rescue.</p>
      <p>"Hi, is this McDonald's?" <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIr4dthS94k">Charlie asked the 911 operator</a> who answered his call.</p>
      <p>When asked whether he had an emergency, Charlie requested a Happy Meal before hanging up.</p>
      <p>According to his mom, Kim Skabelund, the family was getting ready for a Halloween party on Oct. 27 when the phone rang.</p>
      <p>Not realizing what Charlie had done, Skabelund said they were "shocked and kind of embarrassed" when the 911 dispatcher called back and asked to speak to Charlie's dad.</p>
      <p>Although Charlie was safe, a police officer still had to come by to conduct a welfare check.</p>
      <p>Afraid that he was in trouble, Charlie was shy at first. But when Valdez brought a Happy Meal, Skabelund said the two became buddies.</p>
      <p>Charlie, a generally sweet and kind preschooler known for putting others ahead of himself, was most excited to share the Happy Meal with his sister.</p>
      <p>"We were so appreciative of how Officer Valdez handled the situation," Skabelund told CNN. "He taught Charlie a valuable lesson that day, not only how to use 911 appropriately, but also how to treat others with love and kindness."</p>
      <p>Skabelund said the family hoped Valdez's extra effort will be an example for people to be kinder to each other.</p>
