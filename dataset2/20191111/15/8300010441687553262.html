      <p>A rare astronomical alignment is happening Monday, as Mercury passes directly between Earth and the sun -- an event known as a transit.<br/><br/>The Mercury transit is visible across the Americas, Europe, Africa and western Asia, according to <a href="http://accuweather.com/">AccuWeather</a>.<br/><br/>You can view the transit with a telescope that has proper solar filters, but be warned that looking at the sun without proper solar filters could cause permanent eye damage.<br/><br/>Transits are very rare and occur about 13 times every century.<br/><br/>The next Mercury transit won't happen until Nov. 13, 2032.</p>
