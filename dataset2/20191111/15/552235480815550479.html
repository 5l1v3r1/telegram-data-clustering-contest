      <h1>West Dunbartonshire animal lovers call for a ban to firework sales</h1>
      <h2>Helensburgh resident Jane Kerr organised a protest walk in Levengrove Park on Sunday.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T15:47:29+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 15:47</time> by <a rel="author">Fraser Clarke, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/fraser-clarke/</a></address>
      <p>Pet owners sick of seeing their companions being terrified by fireworks have called on their public sale to be banned after organising a protest walk at Levengrove Park.</p>
      <p>The shock of the loud noises can cause panic in plenty of our furry friends, potentially leading to serious issues like heart attacks and strokes.</p>
      <p>And that has prompted more than half-a-million people to sign an online petition calling for an urgent review of firework regulations, as animal lovers throughout the country start to make their voices heard.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Speaking to the Lennox Herald, Jane Kerr, who organised Sunday’s walk, explained why seeing the impact fireworks had on her own border collie, Bonnie, left her knowing she had to act.</p>
      <p>She said: “When the public display went ahead it was advertised well in advance and I managed to get away with it by getting Bonnie ear plugs and keeping her indoors, but then a neighbour decided to start letting some off and she panicked and ended up shaking under my bed for four hours.</p>
      <p>“It’s absolutely horrendous to the point where our dog could have a stroke or a heart attack because of it.</p>
      <p>“It’s not just pets though, they can cause stress to farm animals, autistic children, people with anxiety or PTSD.</p>
      <p>“I read a story last year about a horse that was found dead in a field because it got a shock from the fireworks.</p>
      <p>“We have to raise our voices and speak up for our pets. We are the only voices they have.”</p>
      <p>Jane has also added her voice to the growing number of people calling for the public sale of fireworks to be banned, with a report released by the Scottish Government last month showing that 87 per cent of the population would support an outright ban on their sale.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>She continued: “It’s unnecessary to have them on public sale because it means that these fireworks are getting into the hands of irresponsible younger children, or neighbours of people with pets, <br/>children with conditions or whoever.</p>
      <p>“So many people are under the same stress and are totally helpless to stop it.</p>
      <p>“If enough of us speak up then the government will have to take steps, I don’t want to stop people having fun – but I want to stop the needless suffering every single year.”</p>
