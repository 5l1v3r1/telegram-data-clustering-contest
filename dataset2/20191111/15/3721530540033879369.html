      <p>With <i>Pokémon Sword and Shield</i> a few days away, Game Freak has released the game’s official launch trailer, which gives us a look at a couple of new faces. There’s a curious new stone creature, who appears around the :23 second mark. But, more importantly, Game Freak slyly revealed the existence of a more British-looking Mr. Mime.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/4/20947772/pokemon-sword-shield-final-starter-evolutions-nintendo-switch-leak-cinderace-rillaboom-inteleon">Based on existing Pokémon leaks</a>, we know that this is Mr. Rime — a new evolution for Mr. Mime, Pokémon’s freakish clown. The Galarian evolution features a top hat, mustache, and cane, which gives him a more refined look. But, there’s still an inkling of Mr. Mime’s unsettling aura on Mr. Rime’s belly, which looks like a smiling jester. It’s a great design that speaks to how much Game Freak continues to have fun with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/10/16/20917080/pokemon-sword-shield-new-gigantamax-pikachu-meowth-eevee-memes">its Galarian forms and region-specific evolutions</a>. Who would have expected a follow-up to the psychic comic, much less one that looks like this?</p>
