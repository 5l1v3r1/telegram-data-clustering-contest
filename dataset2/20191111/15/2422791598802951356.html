      <p>Paris authorities say British singer Pete Doherty has been arrested for the second time in the space of a week.</p>
      <p>The Paris prosecutor's office said Monday the 40-year old former Libertines and Babyshambles frontman was placed in custody Sunday for "violence by a person in a manifest state of intoxication."</p>
      <p>It was just one day after he was released from custody. He had been detained in the night of Thursday-Friday over a foiled cocaine purchase.</p>
      <p>The prosecutor's office couldn't confirm French media reports that the latest trouble involved Doherty punching at a teenager in the chic Saint-Germain area of Paris.</p>
      <p>Since rising to fame in the noughties, Doherty, the ex-boyfriend of model Kate Moss, has been repeatedly arrested for drug offences.</p>
