      <p>Rep. Peter King (R-NY) said Monday that he will retire after fourteen terms, declining to seek reelection in 2020.</p>
      <p>The Long Island congressman is known for his hardline stances on immigration and national security matters.</p>
      <p>“After 28 years of spending 4 days a week in Washington, D.C., it is time to end the weekly commute and be home in Seaford,” King <a href="https://www.facebook.com/petekingforcongress/photos/a.10150245900108417/10157884247618417/?type=3&amp;theater">wrote</a> on his Facebook page.</p>
      <p>King adds to the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/trump-s-house-gop-down-100-members-ahead-impeachment-fight-n1079431">growing pile</a> of Republicans who aren’t seeking reelection next year, but he indicated he would stay involved in politics, pointing to his seven-figure campaign war chest.</p>
      <p>Though he initially endorsed Donald Trump “not with enthusiasm,” as he <a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2016/05/06/rep-peter-king-on-support-trump-lead-live.cnn">said</a> in May 2016, King warmed to the President.</p>
      <p>“In fact, when he comes in to speak with Republicans, he’ll sometimes single me out to speak,” he <a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/articles/personality/interviews-and-profiles/rep-pete-king-interview-love-donald-trump.html">gushed</a> in a mid-2017 profile.</p>
      <p>In his statement Monday, the congressman said he would stick by Trump’s side.</p>
      <p>“In the coming weeks and during the next year I intend to vote against President Trump‘s impeachment and will support the President’s bid for re-election,” he wrote.</p>
      <p>The pair has similarly aggressive views on immigration and other issues.</p>
      <p>In December, after the death of a second migrant child in U.S. government custody, King defended Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately, people living in those conditions, that can happen,” <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/king-praises-ice-excellent-record">he said</a>, comparing the situation to public housing in New York City.</p>
      <p>“I think ICE has an excellent record,” he added. (The children who died were in the custody of Customs and Border Protection, another Homeland Security agency, not ICE.)</p>
      <p>A month before Trump’s inauguration, King <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/peter-king-anonymous-intelligence-reports-muslim-surveillance">told reporters</a> that he suggested the President pursue a nationwide program to monitor Muslims similar to an effort that had been discontinued in New York City.</p>
      <p>“I suggested a program similar to what Commissioner Kelly did here in New York, and that we can’t worry about political correctness,” King said.</p>
      <p>The congressman twice chaired the House Homeland Security Committee.</p>
