      <h1>Unai Emery labelled "tactically inept" amid claims Arsenal players have "lost faith"</h1>
      <h2>Arsenal boss Unai Emery isn't in immediate danger of getting sacked but fans are starting to get on the Spaniard's back as results continue to go against the Gunners</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T15:28:32+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 15:28</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Unai Emery is "tactically inept" and the Arsenal team may have lost faith in his ability.</p>
      <p>That's the opinion of former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> midfielder Danny Murphy, who reckons Sheffield United boss Chris Wilder would be doing a better job if he was in charge in north London.</p>
      <p>The Gunners have made a poor start in the Premier League this season and have won just four of their opening 12 fixtures in the English top flight.</p>
      <p>Emery is under pressure to turn things around, with fans beginning to get on his back, but the board have ensured the Spaniard isn't in immediate danger of getting the sack.</p>
      <p>Despite this, Murphy reckons the Gunners would be better off with another man at the helm - and has suggested there is a lack of faith in Emery among the Arsenal players.</p>

      <p>He told <a href="https://twitter.com/talkSPORT/status/1193854634554621952">talkSPORT:</a> "[Granit] Xhaka was never a holding midfielder, he should never have been playing as a holding midfielder, it wasn't the answer.</p>
      <p>"[Lucas] Torreira was there, he's playing now, but you have got Torreira and a young lad, [Matteo] Guendouzi - who has done well, actually, he's probably been one of their best players.</p>
      <p>"You're <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> football club, you're trying to compete, you're trying to get back in the Champions League places and they have not got enough.</p>

      <p>"His hands are tied a bit in terms of the recruitment possibilities they have, but ultimately, they are tactically so inept.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/watford-fc">"Watford</a> away was another one where they kept playing out from the back and kept losing it. I am all for sticking with your philosophy, but change things during a game, mix it up. He has shown before that he doesn't mind mixing it up.</p>

      <p>"When he first came there were lots of substitutions early in games, lost of tactical changes.</p>
      <p>"Maybe the players have lost faith a little bit, and that, unfortunately, subconsciously, creates a really bad physical reaction in terms of not believing what you're doing when you go out on the pitch, and it drains you."</p>
