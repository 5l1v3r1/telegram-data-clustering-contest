        <b>Toto Wolff says that he and Mercedes want to end their record breaking season on a positive note with victories at the Brazilian and Abu Dhabi Grands Prix. Mercedes have already won a record sixth drivers' and constructors' double in a row.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Wolff will be taking a week off this week and won't be at the Brazilian Grand Prix, missing a race for the first time since 2013, but he believes his team will be good enough without him to take victory.</p>

      <p>The Mercedes team boss says that he hopes his team will be able to fight for both qualifying and race win in Brazil.</p>
      <p>He said:Â <i>"We have two races to go in the 2019 season and we want to end this season on a high.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>"The next stop takes us to Brazil which brings back fond memories from last year when we were not only able to win the race but also secure the constructors' championship at Interlagos.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"It's a very short track which makes qualifying particularly challenging as the margins are very small.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"We have generally not had the fastest car on Saturdays since the summer break, but we were able to take pole in Austin and will try to fight for a front row start again at Sao Paulo."</i>
      </p>
