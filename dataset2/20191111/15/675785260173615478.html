      <h2>Lorraine now pretends to be called Derek when she books tables at restaurants to 'save the hassle'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T15:48:14+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 15:48</time> by <a rel="author">Luke Matthews, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/luke-matthews/</a></address>
      <p>A mum who says her deep voice has seen her mistaken for a man on the phone for a decade now says her name is Derek to make things easier.</p>
      <p>Lorraine Chademunhu finds using the phone to contact her bank nearly impossible, and says her account has even been blocked on numerous occasions due to mistaken identity.</p>
      <p>The 42-year-old, who says she's always had a deep voice, used to combat the problem by visiting Barclays in person but her since her branch in Surrey closed, she's been told to use telephone banking.</p>
      <p>The nurse says she's 'continuously quizzed' every time she calls up and spends 'at least 20 minutes' arguing with staff to prove it is her.</p>

      <p>When she makes formal complaints, the bank say they have added a note on her account for future employees but Lorraine says it makes 'no difference'.</p>
      <p>Booking tables at restaurants proves so difficult, she now just gives the name Derek to save time.</p>
      <p>Sick of the confusion with her bank, Lorraine said: "I can't even add up the amount of hours I've spent on the phone being passed from pillar to post.</p>
      <p>"I'm just so insulted and humiliated.</p>
      <p>"I get it all - Sir, Mr Lorraine, buddy, the list goes on.</p>
      <p>"I tell them you are speaking to Lorraine and then they just turn around and say 'well is she there?'</p>
      <p>"I try to avoid using telephone banking as much as I can.</p>
      <p>"But if I lose my wallet, my card or can't log into my online banking I have no choice.</p>
      <p>"Sure my voice gets picked up a lot of the time. When I book a table at a restaurant I just give the name 'Derek' to save hassle.</p>
      <p>"If I have to phone the AA when I breakdown or if I'm calling someone to fix the house I just go along with being a man to make life easier.</p>
      <p>"That I'm used to and I can understand as my voice is deep.</p>
      <p>"But when it's my own personal account and I've told them time and time again about it, it's just poor customer care.</p>
      <p>"I provide them with my mother's maiden name, the address I have lived at for years but none of it is good enough."</p>

      <p>Although the mum-of-two understands the security measures put in place by Barclays, she's now 'had enough' of having to 'jump through the same hoops and reaching the same conclusion' every time.</p>
      <p>Last week, Lorraine was addressed as 'sir' at least 19 times when she called up for a new bank card.</p>
      <p>"The thing is I have other accounts with Lloyds and Halifax and I'm able to get around that because they have voice recognition," she added.</p>
      <p>"I don't see why Barclays haven't caught on there.</p>
      <p>"I don't bother putting on a high pitch to Barclays because why should I?</p>
      <p>"I've thought about changing banks but because it's tied up with the house it's so difficult.</p>
      <p>"And every time I'm reassured things will get fixed.</p>
      <p>"I'm a nurse and work unsociable hours. I don't have time to be skipping into Barclays.</p>
      <p>"Last time I did that the person behind the counter told me I had to phone up customer services anyway.</p>
      <p>"I did it there in store and then passed the phone across. I had to hear them having a chat about whether or not I was a woman.</p>
      <p>"They look at me up and down before chuckling and say 'I know'.</p>
      <p>"It was humiliating.</p>
      <p>"Part of me thought 'do I have to take my clothes off in order for you lot to get the picture?'</p>
      <p>"After I left that bank, I got in my car and I was in tears.</p>
      <p>"It really does get me down and it's horrible for my children to see.</p>
      <p>"I've just had enough."</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Barclays said: "We have apologised to Miss Chademunhu for the inconvenience she has experienced.</p>
      <p>"Protecting our customers' accounts is our top priority, and we have robust measures in place to identify and verify a customer when they call.</p>
      <p>"We have reached out to Miss Chademunhu to implement a verification process that will identify her more quickly in the future."</p>
