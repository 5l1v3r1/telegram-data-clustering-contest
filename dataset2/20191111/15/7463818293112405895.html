      <h1>Xiaomi foldable phone with pop-up penta camera system shown off</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T15:00:13+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 15:00</time> by <a rel="author">Rei Padla</a></address>
      <p>Earlier this year, renders of a Xiaomi foldable phone showing an outward folding display surfaced. A demo was even presented while another set of images was rendered. Not much information has been provided but we can look forward to a Xiaomi foldable phone as per a recent patent from CNIPA. The phone is a foldable device but with a new addition–a pop-up camera system with five cameras. We only have screenshots but we can see the cameras are placed on the left part of the display.</p>
      <p>There is no information when the foldable phone will be launch but the <a href="https://www.tigermobiles.com/blog/leaked-devices/">last we heard</a> was that it would be revealed soon. Soon could mean before year-end or early next year. The timing could also mean the Xiaomi foldable phone will directly compete with the Samsung Galaxy Fold and Huawei Mate X.</p>
      <p>We’re hoping the Xiaomi foldable phone will not face any problem like the Mate X and Galaxy Fold. The Chinese OEM has been working on the foldable smartphone-tablet.  It’s only a matter of time before the official reveal.</p>

      <p>The Xiaomi foldable phone will come after the Xiaomi Mi CC9 Pro (aka Mi Note 10)–also with five cameras at the rear. We don’t see any selfie shooter.</p>
      <p>The idea of a foldable phone is exciting just by looking at the Xiaomi foldable phone patent file. There is a possibility the phone’s Penta pop-up camera system will also work as a front-facing cam. The phone’s design seems to be clean and sleek with a smooth screen that folds outward but details are really scarce so we’ll just wait and see.</p>
