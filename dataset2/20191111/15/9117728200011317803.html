        <b>Sebastian Vettel says that his teammate Charles Leclerc deserves more credit for his qualifying form this season, with the Monegasque showing exactly why Ferrari hired him on Saturdays this season. Leclerc has more poles than any other driver in 2019, with the number 16 car lining up P1 seven times.</b>

      <p>Leclerc has been impressive this season, but some are tipping him and Vettel to clash next season, although given Vettel's recent quotes, it seem slike there is plenty of respect between the pair.</p>
