      <p>DUBAI: Star England batsman <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Jonny-Bairstow">Jonny Bairstow</a> was on Monday reprimanded by the International Cricket Council (<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ICC">ICC</a>) for his "obscene" reaction after being dismissed in the series-deciding T20I against New Zealand at Eden park in Auckland.</p>
      <p>Bairstow, who was the man of the match for his whirlwind 18-ball 47, also received one demerit point after being found guilty of a Level 1 breach of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel.</p>
      <p>The incident happened on Sunday when Bairstow used an "audible obscenity" after his dismissal in the seventh over, which was picked up by the stump mic and heard on TV.</p>
      <p>After the day's play, Bairstow admitted the offence and accepted the sanction proposed by <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Andy-Pycroft">Andy Pycroft</a> of the Emirates ICC Elite Panel of Match Referees and, as such, there was no need for a formal hearing.</p>
      <p>"The England batsman was found to have violated Article 2.3 of the code, which relates to 'use of an audible obscenity during an international match'," the ICC said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The charge was levelled by on-field umpires Wayne Knights and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Chris-Gaffaney">Chris Gaffaney</a> and third umpire Christopher Brown as well as fourth umpire Shaun Haig.</p>
      <p>Level 1 breaches carry a minimum penalty of an official reprimand, a maximum penalty of 50 per cent of a player's match fee, and one or two demerit points.</p>
