      <p>A woman charged with an offence arising from violence in west Belfast which culminated in the death of Christopher Meli has admitted a charge of affray on the night in question.</p>
      <p>Mr Meli, a 20-year old father-of-one, was beaten to death on a pathway known as Doc's Lane in Twinbrook on December 12 2015.</p>
      <p>Shannon McIlwaine appeared at Belfast Crown Court, where her barrister asked that she be re-arraigned.</p>
      <p>The 21-year old, from Glenalina Crescent in west Belfast, spoke to confirm her name.</p>
      <p>She was then charged with 'unlawfully displaying force and making an affray' on December 12 2015.</p>
      <p>When the charge was put to her, she replied "guilty".</p>
      <p>Barrister Charles MacCreanor QC said his client's plea was on the grounds it was "not one of causing actual violence that led to the death of Mr Meli" but rather it was agreed on the basis she was part of the crowd that "moved before the violence".</p>
      <p>Crown barrister Neil Connor QC said McIlwaine's plea was accepted on those grounds as "that is the prosecution's case".</p>
      <p>A total of five young people have now entered various pleas linked to violent confrontations in the area on the night in question.</p>
      <p>Three defendants are facing trial for murdering Mr Meli. They are Caolan Laverty (20) from Belfast Road in Glenavy, 22-year old Lee Smyth with an address in Co Antrim that cannot be reported, and Stephen McCann (22) from Dundrinne Road in Castlewellan.</p>
      <p>The trial is due to commence later this month, with Mr Justice Colton informing yesterday's hearing that he will sentence McIlwaine for the affray charge upon its completion.</p>
      <p>After no objections to continuing bail were voiced, the judge told McIlwaine she was free to go.</p>
