      <h3>An artistic impression of a pickup truck version of the Hyundai Venue compact SUV has surfaced online, thereby hinting at an ultra-cool look</h3>
      <p>The Hyundai Venue has been on sale in India since late-May this year and has been among the highest-selling sub-compact-SUVs in the local car market. The Venue is the South Korean carmaker’s first-ever sub-4-metre SUV. It’s primarily targeted at the Indian market, where pickup models are niche products with low demand.</p>
      <p>Still, this hasn’t kept some rendering artists from visualizing pickup versions of the Maruti Vitara Brezza rival. The latest rendering of the Hyundai Venue pickup visualizes a macho-looking model with a bold red paint scheme and a rather large loading bay for a vehicle that measures less than four-metre in length.</p>
      <p>Other than this, the rendered vehicle also seems to get slightly smaller rear doors but the original look of the sub-compact-SUV has been retained to a large extent, especially if you look at the front fascia. The Hyundai Venue has been developed by the South Korean carmaker at a cost of USED 100 million and sits below the Creta.</p>
