      <h1>Turns Out Dan Humphrey Wasn't Supposed to Be Gossip Girl</h1>

      <p>I don't think I've ever truly recovered from the <i>Gossip Girl</i> finale that revealed New York's elusive, all-knowing blogger wasn't a girl after all, but Dan "Lonely Boy" Humphrey. Somebody, anybody, make it make sense! And as it turns out, the <i>Gossip Girl </i>writers didn't initially intend for Dan Humphrey to be GG—instead, they actually believed Nate Archibald could've been just as shocking as Dan.</p>
      <p>Joshua Safran,<i> Gossip Girl </i>writer and executive producer, sat down at Vulture Festival this weekend to discuss the upcoming Gossip Girl <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a26111274/gossip-girl-reboot-details/">reboot</a>. But of course, fans were still miffed about the shocking reveal that happened seven years ago. According <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/shylawatson/gossip-girl-actually-nate-not-dan">to Buzzfeed</a>, Safran revealed that Dan wasn't his first choice but "had his heart set on Eric [Van der Woodsen]"—Serena's little brother, played by Connor Paolo. However, after a <i>New York Post</i> article predicted that GG was Eric, Safran and the team decided to try to make Nate Gossip Girl—but that didn't make sense either.</p>
      <p>Safran told the crowd that "one of the writers realized that Nate had never sent a tip in to Gossip Girl, which is true at least through the end of season 5. Nate never sent in a tip in through all of those episodes, which is when we're like, 'Oh, well then he's Gossip Girl.'"</p>
      <p>Safran also opened up about the upcoming <i>Gossip Girl</i> reboot, which he says takes place "12 years, I guess 13 years after the original. So we are in real time from the original where we are in the show." He added that he's "really interested in sort of, like, high school juniors [who] have a million Twitter and Instagram followers. What's that like?"</p>
      <p>Can you imagine the damage Blair Waldorf could've done with 1.5 million followers?</p>
