      <p>DENVER — The City of Denver has settled with a United Airlines pilot in a <a href="https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/denver-pays-300k-to-united-airlines-pilot-after-indecent-exposure-arrest-at-dia-hotel">wrongful arrest case</a> stemming from a now-dismissed indecent exposure charge in September of 2018.</p>
      <p>The city has agreed to pay $300,000 to Captain Andrew Collins, his attorney, Craig Silverman, announced Monday in a news release.</p>
      <p>Collins, who's been a pilot for 22 years, <a href="https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/united-airlines-pilot-cited-for-indecent-exposure-at-dia-hotel">was arrested in September</a> 2018 after being accused of standing naked in front of his 10th-floor hotel window overlooking the Denver International Airport terminal.</p>
      <p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2018/11/19/united-pilot-indecent-exposure-denver-international-airport/">The Denver Post,</a> the Virginia native said he didn’t know that he was visible to anyone in the main terminal.</p>
      <p>“I was getting ready for a shower and was talking on the phone,” he told the paper. “It was a beautiful morning, and I opened the curtains to my window. I couldn’t see the terminal.”</p>
      <p>A judge dismissed criminal charges against Collins in March, but the incident had already led to a six-month suspension from United Airlines.</p>
      <p>Collins said he wants the DIA Westin to alter the way they operate, stating in his attorney’s press release that constitutional rights to privacy in a hotel room needs to be respected.</p>
      <p>Collins urged the DIA hotel to make changes and warn its guests about the openness of the rooms’ interiors.</p>
