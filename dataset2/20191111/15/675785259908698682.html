      <p>A bus driver was caught on camera telling a disabled passenger: "I don't understand foreign languages."</p>
      <p>Royal Mail worker Ian Barrington was also denied help with the disabled ramp because the driver said she had backache.</p>
      <p>The 44-year-old and his wife, Katar Zyna, 34, got a First Bus from their home village of Thorney, Cambridgeshire, to nearby Peterborough, on November 4.</p>
      <p>Ian, who moved to the UK seven years ago after he was shot and paralysed during a robbery, said the driver refused to operate the ramp to let him on and his wife had to do the job.</p>

      <p>He added that the driver became angry and threatened to throw him off the bus as he and Katar discussed the lack of help during the journey.</p>
      <p>The video shows Ian sitting in the wheelchair bay on the bus shouting to the bus driver: "Come and put me off because I’m speaking my mind, come and put me off!”</p>
      <p>The driver shouts back: “You should be ashamed of yourself!”</p>
      <p>Ian responds: “I should be ashamed of myself?” The driver says: “Yeah.” Ian then reminds the driver: “You’re documented, yeah? Just remember that.”</p>
      <p>The driver shouts back: “I don’t understand foreign languages, I understand English!”</p>
      <p>Ian responds: “You don’t understand foreign languages, I’m a foreigner now. Am I not speaking English?”</p>
      <p>The driver snaps back: “Are you going to shut up or get off!” Ian says: “Come and put me off if I'm doing something wrong.”</p>
      <p>The video then jumps to Ian pointing a camera at the driver as he appears to gesture for her set the ramp down for him.</p>

      <p>The driver then opens the cockpit door and asks someone to open the ramp for Ian to get off saying: “Could you come and open this ramp for me darling, thank you.” Before closing the cockpit again.</p>
      <p>A passenger then tries to open the ramp up for Ian. The bus driver sitting in her chair then corrects the passenger for doing it wrong saying: “No no down the side sweetheart. Just lift that ramp.”</p>
      <p>The bus driver, pointing with a mobile phone in her hand, then responds to Ian’s question as to why she can’t open it. She says: “No I can’t, no I’ve told you I’ve got back ache.”</p>
      <p>Ian wrote on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> : “First Bus need to screen and train their employees before allowing them to represent their company.</p>
      <p>“As a disabled person, life can be really challenging. We struggle with mobility, we struggle with loss of independence, transportation, accessibility issue, employment, communication and social relationships, getting married and self-esteem.</p>

      <p>First Bus told local media that they were taking the incident 'very seriously.'</p>
      <p>Chris Speed, Head of operations at First Eastern Counties, said: “We are taking this allegation very seriously as it is certainly not the kind of service we would expect to be provided by one of our driving team.</p>
      <p>“I will be investigating the matter and will correspond with the gentleman concerned when the process is concluded."</p>
