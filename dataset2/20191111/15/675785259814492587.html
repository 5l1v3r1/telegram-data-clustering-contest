      <p>They wanted to keep the sex of their unborn baby a surprise, so didn't go down the usual celebrity route of throwing a gender reveal party.</p>
      <p>The pair <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/brooke-vincent-hosts-lavish-baby-18830556">did have a lavish rainbow-themed baby shower</a> , however, where Brooke posed with a white cake and a bunch of multicoloured balloons.</p>
      <p>Brooke also <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/pregnant-coronation-street-stars-show-18950618">joined her Corrie co-stars Hayley Tamaddon and Julia Goulding</a> for a special spa day in August, where the trio compared their growing baby bumps.</p>
      <p>The close friends showed off their bumps in their swimsuits, with Hayley captioning the snap: "Mummy's to be having a spa day at the garden spa in Warrington .. proudly showing off our baby bumps. So lucky we get to go through this together."</p>
