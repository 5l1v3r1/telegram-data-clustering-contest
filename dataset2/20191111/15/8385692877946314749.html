      <p>Amazon has <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">discounted</a> the app-controlled Ember Coffee Mug today, putting it on sale for just $70. That is good for around $10 off of its regular price.</p>
      <p>Now this isn't the larger Ember that most people have seen, this is a smaller coffee mug that will keep your coffee warm for hours on end.</p>
      <p>Ember says that this one has a battery life of about an hour, which doesn't seem like much. But it does charge wirelessly on the coaster. So as long as you leave it on your desk, it'll stay warm all day without any issues.</p>

      <p>This is an app-controlled coffee mug that you can use to keep your coffee warm. This is really great for those that work from home. Using the app, you can set the temperature that you want your coffee to remain at. So you can keep it at the perfect temperature all day. It will work for up to 145 degrees.</p>
      <p>The Ember Coffee Mug is also safe to wash, though I wouldn't put it in the dishwasher. It probably goes without saying, but since this is a tech product, it is waterproof. With a IPX7 rating. Meaning that it can be submerged under water for a good 30 minutes without any issues. So you can put it in the sink and wash it everyday that you use it.</p>
      <p>This coffee mug is going to be great for those that like to drink a lot of coffee or even tea. As it's going to keep it warm all day long. And that's definitely better than having to put your mug in the microwave every few hours â€“ especially if you're a slow drinker.</p>
