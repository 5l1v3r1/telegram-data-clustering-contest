      <h1>Meet our City A.M. PA Awards Judges - Alice Scutchey</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T15:16:07+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 15:16</time> by <a rel="author">City A.M. Events</a></address>
      <p>Alice Scutchey is a Senior Executive Assistant at Citi and the founder and director of the Canary Wharf PA Club.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What made you decide to set up the Canary Wharf PA Club?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I launched an internal network a couple of years ago but decided to expand on this idea when I returned from maternity leave in 2019. I had a lot of contacts that worked in Canary Wharf so I wanted to create something that involved the wider community rather than just within the bank. A few weeks into launching the CWPA club, we had hundreds of subscribers so I knew it was something that local assistants were interested in.</p>

        <b>How do you think getting into the real world of work at an early age has benefitted your career?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I have always been a worker-bee and couldn’t wait to get out into the real world. I think working from a young age has taught me incredible resilience in what can be a very demanding and competitive environment. It has also allowed me to build years of experience versus years of education. </p>
      <p>
        <b>What are the main changes you have seen in the workplace for PA’s/EA’s since you started out?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The role has changed massively since my first job as an Admin Assistant. It’s now a more strategic business-partner position rather than data-entry and diary management. A modern day assistant requires constant upskilling to grow with AI and make use of the tools available to them. </p>
      <p>
        <b>What qualities are you looking for in City A.M PA of the year?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Someone that goes above and beyond in their role. An advocate for the PA/EA Industry who sets the bar for future assistants. A real right-hand man/woman who values their role in the business and strives to perform at the highest level.</p>
