      <p>A flight has been evacuated after a man stormed on board without a passport or boarding pass.</p>
      <p>Horrified passengers were forced off the jet at Barcelona Airport as the intruder locked himself in the plane's toilet when he was confronted by an air hostess.</p>
      <p>The Vueling flight VY 8720 from Barcelona to Dublin was due to take off at 12.40pm but the chaos ensued after security is said to have been tipped-off that someone had boarded the plane illegally</p>
      <p>Passengers Mark Megarry and Paul Steward told <a href="https://www.dublinlive.ie/news/dublin-news/live-passengers-rushed-dublin-airport-17237764">Dublin Live</a> how the man ran into the toilet when he was questioned by the airline worker.</p>
      <p>They said: "Apparently police and security got word that someone had boarded the plane that shouldn't have.</p>

      <p>"An air hostess began asking everyone on the plane for their boarding passes and passports.</p>
      <p>"The man was sitting in front of us and after the air hostess had checked ours, he jumped up out of his seat and ran.</p>
      <p>"He pushed his way past the air hostess. A passenger near the back jumped out of their seat and tried to stop him also but he pushed them out of the way too and locked himself in the bathroom.</p>
      <p>"Passengers began to panic then as they thought there was a bomb threat or something."</p>
      <p>The plane was at a standstill in Spain while security tried to coax the man out of the toilet</p>
      <p>He has since been removed and is being held by police.</p>
      <p>They added: "We have to all re-check back in now again at the airport. Police came on the plane and stood at the door of the toilet as they try to persuade the man to come out."</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for Vueling Airline told Mirror Online: "During the boarding process of flight BCN-DUB VY8720 in Barcelona, gate agents identified a passenger trying to board this flight with a false passport.</p>
      <p>"Whilst waiting for the arrival of the authorities, this person managed to run towards the aircraft toilet and lock himself therein.</p>
      <p>"Vueling disembarked all passengers safely and proceeded to change aircraft so our customers were able to continue their journey to their destination.</p>
      <p>"There was no impact on passengers and cabin crew and the local authorities are in full charge of the situation."</p>
