      <p>Former Rangers midfielder Mikel Arteta is a target for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/everton">Everton</a> as current boss Marco Silva continues to struggle.</p>
      <p>The Toffees have spent a fortune on players in recent years but sit in 15th position having won only four of their 12 games so far.</p>
      <p>Arteta, a treble winner at Rangers in 2003, has excelled as <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/pep-guardiola">Pep Guardiola</a> 's number two, helping the club to five major trophies in three years.</p>
      <p>And now Everton are interested in making their former midfielder manager if they decide to dispense with Silva.</p>

      <p>Speaking on the <a href="https://play.acast.com/s/thetransferwindow">Transfer Window Podcast</a> , big deal guru Duncan Castles revealed: "There is a lot of interest from the Everton end in Mikel Arteta as a candidate should they need to make a change.</p>
      <p>"This makes a lot of sense because Arteta's status in the game is very high.</p>
      <p>"He has not managed yet but he's credited as an important part of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city">Manchester City</a> 's treble winning campaign last season as Pep Guardiola's principle assistant. He was a strong candidate for the Arsenal job before they appointed <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/unai-emery">Unai Emery</a> and a lot of Gunners supporters would have preferred Arteta, a former player.</p>
      <p>"He's a former Everton player as well so it's not to see wht the name is being considered given that Arsenal took him as a serious candidate in the job."</p>
      <p>"This is one to pay attention to and see how it develops."</p>
