      <p><a href="http://nme.com/artists/george-michael">George Michael</a>‘s sister has dismissed Elton John’s suggestions that the ‘Faith’ singer was “uncomfortable” with his sexuality.</p>
      <p>Speaking to US daytime show The Talk recently, Elton claimed that Michael was never truly accepting of being a gay man and said he “didn’t want to be here” prior to his death on Christmas Day in 2016.</p>
      <p>But his sister Melanie Panayiotou has said the suggestion is entirely incorrect.</p>
      <p>Speaking to The Big Issue, she explained Michael “was my very proud to be gay brother, contrary to what you may have read recently”.</p>
      <p>Discussing his own sexuality in an interview prior to this death, Michael said: “I never had a moral problem with being gay.I thought I had fallen in love with a woman a couple of times. Then I fell in love with a man, and realised that none of those things had been love.”</p>

      <p>The late George Michael</p>
      <p>John said last month: “He couldn’t get it, George. And he resented the fact that I had hinted that maybe he change his life a little bit and he’d be happier if he tried something else.</p>
      <p>“The person has actually got to want it. It’s like me in the end; I really wanted it. I had two alternatives: one, to die, and one to live, and I wanted to live. But that’s the difference if you want it, and poor George didn’t want it.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, last week saw the release of <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/george-michaels-first-posthumous-single-will-be-released-tomorrow-2564544">‘This Is How (We Want You To Get High)’</a>, the first posthumous track to arrive from the late singer.</p>
      <p>The track will feature on the soundtrack of <i>Last Christmas</i> – the upcoming movie inspired by his legendary back catalogue.</p>
