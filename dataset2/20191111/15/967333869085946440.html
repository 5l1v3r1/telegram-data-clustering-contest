      <p>The Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage announced on Monday, 11 November, he would not be fielding candidates in 317 seats where the Conservatives are the favourites to win.</p>
      <blockquote>Instead Farage will target Labour MPs especially in seats in Wales, the Midlands and the North of England.</blockquote>
      <p>Political analysts were quick to seize on the significance of the announcement, saying Farage had effectively gifted the election to the Conservatives.</p>

      <p>​The announcement is a big blow to Jeremy Corbyn and Labour but could also hit the Liberal Democrats’ chances of picking up seats from Tory MPs who faced losing votes to the Brexit Party.</p>

      <p>​Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly welcomed the move, saying the Brexit Party had recognised they risked creating another hung Parliament which would prevent a “stable majority government".</p>
      <p>Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery said it now meant there was effectively a "Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson alliance with Donald Trump to sell out our country."</p>

      <p>​Mr Lavery said: "We urge voters to reject this Thatcherite 1980s tribute act, which would lead to more savage Tory attacks on working class communities. Our NHS is not for sale.”</p>
      <p>Last month Farage had urged Johnson to agree an electoral pact but the prime minister refused to do so.</p>
      <p>There has been no word about whether the Tories and the Brexit Party have made a formal pact.</p>

      <p>​Farage had initially promised to field 600 candidates but he claimed his reason for changing his position was because Boris Johnson had committed to signing a trade deal with the EU which would be without "regulatory alignment" and would be similar to the deal Canada has with Brussels.</p>
      <p>Farage said this was a "huge change" in the Conservatives' approach to Brexit.</p>
