      <h1>Style and comfort coming to Birmingham city centre with a new ECCO store</h1>
      <h2>Leading shoe brand ECCO opens new city centre store in Birmingham with the launch of its new TREDTRAY series</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T15:40:38+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 15:40</time> by <a rel="author">Jonny Dillon</a></address>
      <p>Combining style and comfort, ECCO has grown to become one of the world’s leading shoe brands, building its success on products with a great fit and top-quality leathers. ECCO owns and manages every aspect of the value chain, from its tanneries and shoe manufacturing facilities to its stores and website.</p>
      <p>Founded in Denmark in 1963, the company is still family-owned and now sells its products in over 2,200 shops in 90 countries.</p>
      <p>Based on its most modern retail concept, ECCO is launching a brand-new store in Birmingham from mid-November.</p>
      <p>In conjunction with launching its brand-new store, ECCO will also introduce its new TREDTRAY series this month, putting the Danish brand right at the centre of the growing, global trend for workwear inspired boots.</p>

      <p>Robust, with thick, lugged and non-slip soles, the ECCO TREDTRAY is in line with the fashion for utilitarian, highly functional boots. The series features autumnal and wintry styles in browns and greys, as well as a directional, edgy capsule collection of black boots.</p>
      <p>These boots are perfect for the many wearing moments and styling options that the workwear trend demands. This is not about trekking in the great outdoors, but feeling comfortable and looking good from the commute to the coffee bar.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Stay dry with innovative waterproof technology </b>
      </p>
      <p>The TREDTRAY series features seven styles in ECCO’s new HM100K leather. This premium leather was created using a groundbreaking re-tanning process that was developed in the brand's own tanneries. HM100K leather is combined with ECCO’s waterproofing techniques to produce comfortable and completely waterproof shoes. </p>
      <p>Whether you are exploring the wild on a damp, sodden day, or walking through the city in the driving rain, the state-of-the-art technology will protect your feet, keeping them dry and comfortable.</p>

      <p>Seven styles feature the HM100K leather, while the other of the TREDTRAY styles are made with GORE-TEX®, and the remainder of the collection from Santiago, Nubuck, and full-grain leathers developed in ECCO’s tanneries.</p>
      <p><b>Ultra-modern, lightweight comfort</b>  </p>
      <p>The ECCO TREDTRAY was created using the company's own innovations, which will allow the style-conscious to embrace this trend in ultra-modern, lightweight comfort.</p>
      <p>From the very first step you take in the ECCO TREDTRAY, it delivers lightweight comfort, achieved by combining a deep, lugged rubber tray outsole with ECCO FLUIDFORM™ Direct Comfort Technology. </p>
      <p>Fluid P.U is injected into the tray outsole, forming itself around the edges of the anatomically-shaped last, resulting in not only a lightweight boot, but also a form-fitted feel.</p>

        <b>The new store is located at 41a New Street, B2 4EG. For more information, go to <a href="https://www.eccoshoesuk.com/">www.eccoshoesuk.com</a></b>
