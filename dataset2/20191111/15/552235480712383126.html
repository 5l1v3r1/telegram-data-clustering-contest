      <h1>Supermarket appeals for longer delivery hours following empty shelves complaints</h1>
      <h2>Fresh bread isn’t appearing in the aisles at Asda in Motherwell until mid-morning, prompting complaints from frustrated customers.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T15:38:47+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 15:38</time> by <a rel="author">Wishaw Press, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/wishaw-press/</a></address>
      <p>Shoppers are facing empty shelves because of a ban on early morning deliveries at a Motherwell supermarket.</p>
      <p>Fresh bread isn’t appearing in the aisles at Asda until mid-morning, prompting complaints from frustrated customers.</p>
      <p>Asda says it’s because strict planning conditions prevent it from unloading deliveries until 8am.</p>
      <p>The store, which employs 280 people, is close to flats and houses in the Watson Street area.</p>
      <p>Environmental health officers say longer delivery hours would have a “significant adverse noise impact” on residents.</p>
      <p>Deliveries are allowed only between 8am and 10pm.</p>
      <p>In a submission to North Lanarkshire Council, Asda said: “This causes huge difficulties.</p>
      <p>“Fresh produce arrives at 8am which means shelves are being stacked from 8.30am which is a busy period.</p>
      <p>“Our bread delivery is delayed until 10.30am because other fresh produce is in the delivery bay from 8am.</p>
      <p>“An extra hour at each end of the day would mean big benefits for the store and customers.”</p>
      <p>Shoppers using Asda’s feedback service have complained about empty shelves in the bakery and other fresh produce sections, and warned they’re having to shop elsewhere.</p>
      <p>The council will be urged later this month to extend delivery hours at the store for a one-year trial period.</p>
      <p>Motherwell councillor Agnes Magowan supports longer hours.</p>
      <p>She said: “Customers can’t buy their fresh produce in time for starting their work as staff are still filling the shelves.</p>
      <p>“These delivery hours put Asda at a disadvantage compared to their competitors.”</p>
