      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T15:07:36+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 15:07</time> by <a rel="author">Brian Dick, https://www.facebook.com/blueswriterbriandick/?fref=ts</a></address>
      <p>Birmingham City were not happy with Jude Bellingham’s booking in Saturday’s defeat to Fulham.</p>
      <p>In first half injury time the 16-year-old was involved in a confrontation with match-winner in waiting Aleksandar Mitrovic, which led to referee Jarred Gillett showing a yellow card to both players.</p>
      <p>Before that Bellingham had been left with a bloodied mouth after Anthony Knockaert fell on him - after which Mitrovic needlessly became involved in the debate which prompted the cautions.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Blues</a> youngster appeared to have done nothing to warrant a booking - and speaking after the game Pep Clotet admitted he didn’t know why he had been.</p>

      <p>The Spaniard said: “I think Knockaert tried to tackle him - that’s what Jude told me, there was a  little bit of a misunderstanding with those two. Then Mitrovic appeared and I think it was normal emotion of the game.”</p>
      <p>However, opposite number Scott Parker viewed the incident as a sign that Mitrovic is showing a different side to his undoubted goal-scoring prowess - even if it ended up with him being suspended for the match with QPR.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“I just see it as nothing really, in the heat of the moment a football match where you have got two teams that are fighting to get a result, just squaring up to each other, it’s a little bit of handbags really.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t see nothing other than that, disappointing because obviously Mitro gets a booking and he will be out of the next game, bitterly disappointing but you wouldn’t want to take that out of the game - that’s part of it.</p>
      <p>“Part of his game and part of the game I want him to have, that’s what I want us to be about - that side of it is exactly it.”</p>
