        <b>Former Windies all-rounder Dwayne Bravo came forward to congratulate the team in their historic feat and also hinted about revoking his international retirement. West Indies have finally earned their first ODI series victory since 2014 as they take an unassailable 2-0 lead over Afghanistan.</b>
      </p>
      <p>West Indies have been very dominant in the ongoing three match ODI series as they thrashed Afghanistan in emphatic fashion in the first couple of matches. The Carribean side has taken a series winning lead of 2-0 against the Afghans as they are already cruising towards a series clean sweep.</p>
      <p>This ODI series victory is the first for West Indies in five years as there last one came against Bangladesh as they whitewashed the subcontinent side 3-0 back at their home. Former West Indies hard hitter <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/dwayne_bravo">Dwayne </a><a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/bravo">Bravo</a> congratulated his team and also hinted his return from international retirement.</p>
      <p>“Congratulations to the team. It has been five years since we have not won an ODI series and the boys have now done this. I am a former West Indies cricketer but I may soon come out of international retirement. Let me tell you all that you can’t think that West Indies cricket is now back to where we want it to be. What we have here are the right people in the right places and we are pointing in the right direction,” the former all-rounder said as quoted by Trinidad Guardian.</p>
      <p>Bravo also took a dip at the previous Cricket West Indies regime as he voiced his frustration about the policy of the previous administration which ended the career of many budding players. Bravo felt that those people tried to mould the players according to their needs that ended the career of many players.</p>
      <p>“West Indies cricket has suffered at the hands of vindictive people who were bent on keeping certain people away from the team, ending many careers,” he added.</p>
