        <b>British heavyweight Tommy Fury has set his sights on a "Battle of Britain" with YouTuber KSI in 2020.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Fury, who fights for the first time since appearing on Love Island at London's Copper Box Arena on 21 December, said the pair both have common ground as "influencers".</p>
      <p>"This time next year hopefully we will have a big fight," Fury told BT Sport.</p>
      <p>"I've heard he wants to continue fighting so if he wants a real fight, he knows where I am."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/boxing/50364354">KSI beat fellow YouTuber and American rival Logan Paul</a> by split decision on 9 November, in front of a global audience of millions, and Fury said he watched the fight.</p>
      <p>"He [KSI] is from YouTube and I'm from Love Island and we both have a big following in the UK," said 20-year-old Fury, younger brother of Tyson Fury.</p>
      <p>Fury had two professional contests, winning both, before entering the ITV2 reality dating show earlier this year.</p>
      <p>His promoter Frank Warren said that Fury will "go much further than KSI" in his career.</p>
      <p>Fury's opponent for next month is yet to be confirmed, but the heavyweight said he will be looking to "land heavy artillery" on the undercard of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/boxing/50340587">Daniel Dubois v Kyotaro Fujimoto.</a></p>
      <p>"I'm bringing a whole new audience over of people who have never even watched a fight before. It's not just a fight with blood but it's an event," he added.</p>
      <p>"I do not want to be another reality TV star that has been and gone. I want to build on that platform. I've established who I am and now I want to come back home and that is in the ring."</p>
