      <h2>Buittle Quest is now appealing for members from the local community and further afield</h2>

      <p>A new charity to boost the social and economic life of Palnackie and district is being set up.</p>
      <p>Buittle Quest will go live once Scottish Charity Regulator (OSCR) gives the green light.</p>
      <p>The charitable trust has been named after the parish it will serve.</p>
      <p>Bob Shipway, one of the inaugural trustees, said: “Submitting our application after years of community consultation, planning, development and months of preparation, feels like the first tangible milestone for us all.</p>
      <p>“It’s been a steep learning curve for all of us as we took the results of the consultations, turned them into meaningful plans and adopted a programme of development for our parish.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Buittle Quest will now take these plans forward and implement our improvement programme in the coming years.”</p>
      <p>The initial quest trustees have been named as Viv Brown, Angus Campbell, Brian Carson, Jim Niven, Lorraine Light and Bob Shipway.</p>
      <p>All are existing community councillors on Buittle Parish Community Council. Their first task is already under way – a membership drive to anchor the new trust in the community.</p>
      <p>Mr Shipway said: “With the charity launch being planned as soon as the application is approved, we are now asking our parishioners and the wider public to express their interest in becoming members of Buittle Quest.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“People aged 16 and over who live and vote in our parish can become ordinary members whilst those living outwith Buittle can join as associate members.</p>
      <p>He added: “We are particularly interested in encouraging youngsters aged between 12 and 16 years old to join as junior members regardless of where they live.”</p>
      <p>Membership forms are available in Palnackie Shop, the village hall and on the Palnackie Facebook page.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dumfries-galloway">Buittle Quest will also have forms available at its stall at Buittle Castle Christmas Market on Novermber 30 and the Palnackie Traditional Christmas Fair on December 7.</a>
      </p>
      <p>They can also be obtained from Bob Shipway at bob@wtte-innovation.com.</p>
