      <p>While there is no cure for eczema, or atopic dermatitis, there are things that you can do at home to potentially help with some of the symptoms. The <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/severe-eczema/essential-oils">best essential oils for eczema</a> “may improve hydration; moisturize, soothe, and calm the skin; and reduce inflammation and itching,” <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/bridges-alina-g-d-o/bio-20053193">Alina G. Bridges, DO</a> and dermatologist at the Mayo Clinic, told Bustle in an interview.</p>
      <h3>How do I use essential oils?</h3>
      <p>According to Dr. Bridges, you should definitely not take an essential oil straight from the bottle and rub it onto your skin. Instead, dilute the essential oil in a carrier oil (she recommends coconut oil, sunflower oil, sesame oil, almond oil, jojoba oil, or argan oil). After the <a href="https://www.rockymountainoils.com/dilution-rate/">essential oil is diluted</a>, she noted, “It can be applied to the skin, added to a bath, or diffused into the air for aromatherapy.” You can also add essential oils to a cream (Dr. Bridges recommends shea butter) and rub it into your skin.</p>
      <p>Before using any essential oil for the first time, though, Dr. Bridges recommends testing it out: Apply a small amount with a cotton swab to the inner arm and look for signs of a reaction like redness, itching, burning, or discomfort.</p>
      <h3>How do I know which essential oils to use?</h3>
      <p>When picking out essential oils, you should always look for ones in glass bottles (never plastic because oils can actually <a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/tips-on-buying-essential-oils-88796">dissolve the plastic which will contaminate the oil</a>). You’ll also want to avoid buying essential oils that have any additives or preservatives, or have already been diluted.</p>
      <p>Now, it’s important to know that you shouldn’t just use <i>any </i>essential oils and expect to see improvement in your eczema. Below you’ll find six essential oils to consider.</p>
      <h4>1. Tea Tree Oil</h4>
