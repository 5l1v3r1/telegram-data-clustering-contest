        <b>Earlier this year, Syrian Hawar news agency reported that Syrian Kurds of the Autonomous Administration (AA) in the northeast of the country handed over to the Netherlands and France14 orphaned children of Daesh* terrorist group.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Reuters reported Monday that a court in The Hague ruled that the Netherlands must actively help r<a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201906101075775351-syrian-kurds-daesh-terrorists/">epatriate the children of women</a> who joined Daesh in Syria.</p>
      <p>The ruling, however, notes that the mothers don't need to be accepted.</p>
      <p>The report says, lawyers of 23 Dutch women, who previously joined Daesh, asked a judge to oblige the state <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201910281077163557-britain-secretly-plans-to-repatriate-daesh-brides-and-their-kids---report-/">to repatriate them and their children</a> from a camp in northern Syria.</p>
      <p>According to the lawyers, the families live in "deplorable conditions" in the Al-Hol camp that houses some 68,000 defeated Daesh fighters.</p>
      <p>The Dutch Intelligence Agency previously reported that as of 1 October, there were some 55 Daesh fighters and at least 90 children, who used to live in the Netherlands for a considerable amount of time but then travelled to Syria.</p>
