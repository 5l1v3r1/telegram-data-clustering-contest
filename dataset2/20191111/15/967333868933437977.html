      <p>The popular chat app WhatsApp recently found itself enduring a backlash from disgruntled users who blame it for causing a severe battery drain on their smartphones.</p>
      <p>As the Daily Express notes, this glitch seems to be mostly affecting the users of OnePlus handsets.</p>
      <blockquote>“A week ago, I noticed that the battery on my OnePlus 6 started draining faster than usual. Battery wear is usually more gradual, and I started wondering”, one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/dsx1zq/psa_there_seems_to_be_a_huge_battery_drain_issue/">Reddit</a> user complained. “This coincided with an update of WhatsApp which I installed on my phone - the one with fingerprint unlock”.</blockquote>
      <p>The Redditor added that his phone showed that “WhatsApp used battery ‘While in active use’ for 1.5 hours”, even though they only “opened the app for a minute”.</p>
      <blockquote>“Battery Leech! Ever since the last update, WhatsApp's background activity consumes the battery like it's free cupcakes. 25% in 2 hours according to the battery usage overview”, another person complained in a WhatsApp review quoted by the newspaper. "And that's even though I restricted background activity when I found out. That's ridiculous. Please fix your app.”</blockquote>
      <p>Complaints about this issue also emerged on social media, as well as on Google Play and on the OnePlus Forum.</p>
