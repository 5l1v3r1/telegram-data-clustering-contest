      <p>A man accused of sex offences against his niece 28 years ago has lost a legal fight against extradition to the Republic.</p>
      <p>Senior judges in Belfast rejected his appeal against a decision that he should be returned over the border to face trial.</p>
      <p>The man, referred to as AB due to reporting restrictions, is being sought on three charges of sexual assault of a child.</p>
      <p>The alleged offences were committed at an undisclosed location in the Republic in July 1991.</p>
      <p>Garda√≠ launched an investigation in 1993 - around the same time AB moved to Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>Authorities initially decided not to prosecute him due to a lack of corroborating evidence.</p>
      <p>But a European Arrest Warrant was issued in September 2017 after a new determination was reached in the case.</p>
      <p>AB has been locked in a battle against extradition since he was detained two months later.</p>
      <p>In May 2019 the Recorder for Belfast ruled that he should be transferred to stand trial.</p>
      <p>Lawyers for the wanted man challenged that decision at the High Court, arguing that the request was an abuse of process.</p>
      <p>They also contended that he should not be extradited due to delay in the case, and claimed it would breach his Article 8 rights to private and family life under European law.</p>
      <p>But judges dismissed all three grounds of challenge.</p>
      <p>Madam Justice McBride said: "We do not consider this was a borderline case where the culpable delay would have tipped the balance against extradition."</p>
      <p>AB, who is currently on bail, now has 14 days to consider mounting a further appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>
      <p>If no such legal move is made he us expected to be handed over to authorities across the border.</p>
