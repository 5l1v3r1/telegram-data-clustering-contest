      <h1>Kris Boyd offers mysterious Kieran Tierney Scotland poser suggesting 'something else behind' absence</h1>
      <h2>The pundit reckons there's something going on with the full-back's continued absence</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T15:55:26+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 15:55</time> by <a rel="author">Jonathan McFarlane</a></address>
      <p>Scotland face their upcoming international fixtures against Cyprus and Kazakhstan without the services of fit again Kieran Tierney - and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kris-boyd">Kris Boyd</a> can't understand why.</p>
      <p>The former Scotland striker and pundit feels that <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kieran-tierney">Tierney</a> 's status as a leader means he should have been involved, even if it meant attending in a reduced playing capacity.</p>
      <p>And it has left Boyd questioning what has been going on behind the scenes between the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> full-back and international boss Steve Clarke.</p>

      <p>Speaking on the <a href="https://twitter.com/ScotlandSky/status/1193912209979662336">Sky Sports podcast</a> , he said: "He's a big player for the Scotland group. I don't get it at all.</p>
      <p>"I thought <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steve-clarke">Steve Clarke</a> would have been one that said, 'No, you're coming.'</p>
      <p>"At the end of the day the international set-up has priority over the clubs anyway.</p>
      <p>"Bring him along, there's something, for me there is something else behind it because Kieran Tierney is a talented footballer and by all reports a good kid. Trains properly every single day, works his hardest.</p>
      <p>"I just think there's something else in that one."</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Tierney has recently recovered from the pubic injury that caused him to miss large swathes of last season.</p>
      <p>He made his debut back on September 25th and has been gently introduced to action via the Europa League and Carabao Cup.</p>
      <p>Arsenal fans have been impressed with his performances to date and have been up in arms on social media over his absence from Premier league starting line-ups.</p>
