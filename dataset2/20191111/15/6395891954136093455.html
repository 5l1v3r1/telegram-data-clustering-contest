      <p><b>PARIS (AP)</b> - French President Emmanuel Macron led Armistice Day commemorations on Monday by visiting the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier under Paris' Arc de Triomphe, as a giant tricolor flag flew overhead.</p>
      <p>Greeted by Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, Macron laid a wreath and inspected troops during the ceremony celebrating 101 years since the Armistice that ended the slaughter of World War I.</p>
      <p>Music from a military brass band was slightly muffled by persistent rain for the hundreds of spectators - including former French Presidents Francois Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy - thronging the Champs Elysees avenue. Some waved French flags.</p>
      <p>Macron later inaugurated a tall bronze sculpture in the Andre-Citroën park near the Eiffel Tower, as a monument to the 549 French soldiers who died in foreign operations since 1963.</p>
      <p>They died in 17 theaters of conflict including 141 in Lebanon, 129 in Chad, 85 in Afghanistan and 78 in the former Yugoslavia.</p>
      <p>Commemorations were also underway in France's wartime ally, Britain.</p>
      <p>The Royal British Legion urged the nation to remember the 100th anniversary of the first two-minute silence observed on Armistice Day by shutting out modern technology and all distractions.</p>
      <p>"This year we're asking the nation to pause - mute your phone, close your laptop, switch off the telly - for just two minutes and pay your respects to our Armed Forces community, past and present," the legion said on its website.</p>
      <p>A lone musician at the National Memorial Arboretum played "The Last Post," as silence fell. People at ceremonies across the country bowed their heads in respect.</p>
      <p>In a short break from campaigning for the Dec. 12 elections, Prime Minister Boris Johnson laid a wreath during a service at St Peter's Square, Wolverhampton while Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn attended a ceremony outside Islington Town Hall, north London.</p>
      <p>Britain's largest ceremony took place Sunday . The event in central London is traditionally held on the closest Sunday to the anniversary of the end of World War I at 11 a.m. on Nov. 11, 1918.</p>
      <p>Queen Elizabeth II led the nation in remembering the war dead. The queen, dressed in black, watched from a balcony as her son and heir Prince Charles laid a wreath of scarlet poppies on the Cenotaph war memorial near Parliament.</p>
      <p>The 93-year-old monarch, who served as an army mechanic during World War II, performed the wreath-laying herself for most of her 67-year reign, but has cut back on her public duties.</p>
