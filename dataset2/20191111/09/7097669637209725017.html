      <h1>SpaceX launches another 60 solar-powered internet satellites</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T09:29:17+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 09:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/" target="_blank">William Harwood</a></address>
      <p>A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket with a thrice-flown first stage and a previously used nose cone fairing <a href="https://www.spacex.com/webcast?ftag=YHF4eb9d17">shot into orbit</a> Monday on a Veterans Day flight to launch 60 Starlink internet relay satellites. It was the second batch in a planned constellation of thousands intended to provide broadband service around the world.</p>
      <p>With the rising sun as a backdrop — and <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/mercury-retrograde-planet-passing-directly-between-earth-and-the-sun-today-2019-11-11/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17">Mercury creeping across it</a> in a relatively rare transit — the Falcon 9's nine main engines thundered to life at 9:56 a.m. EST, pushing the slender rocket away from its launchpad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida.</p>
      <p>In keeping with SpaceX's drive to lower costs by reflying its rocket hardware, the Falcon 9's first stage was making a record fourth flight after two missions in 2018 and another earlier this year.</p>
      <p>In another first, the nose cone protecting the Starlink satellites and their deployer during the climb out of the lower atmosphere was making its second flight after an April launch atop a Falcon Heavy rocket.</p>
