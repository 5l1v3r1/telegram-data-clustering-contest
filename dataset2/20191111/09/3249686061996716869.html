      <p><b>Punchnello </b>is back with a new single!</p>
      <p>On November 11 KST, the rapper released the music video for his latest single "<b>Doodle</b>," featuring singer <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/baek-ye-rin">Baek Ye Rin</a>. The single, which was produced by<b> H1GHER Music</b>'s <b>Woogie</b>, has a sentimental mood that is rounded out by a music video that follows the concept of the song's title, as it does not feature Punchnello or Baek Ye Rin, but instead, follows sentimental time spent between a hand-drawn couple.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Punchnello was the winner of '<b>Show Me The Money 8</b>' and recently signed with <b>AOMG</b>. He is also known being a part of the hip-hop crew <b>Club Eskimo</b> with acts like <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/dean">Dean</a>, <b>Millic</b>, <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/offonoff">offonoff</a>, and <b>MISO</b>.</p>
