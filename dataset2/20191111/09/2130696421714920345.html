      <p>THE following companies saw new developments that may affect trading of their securities on Monday:</p>
      <p><b>DBS:</b> South-east Asia’s largest bank's <a href="https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/dbs-q3-profit-climbs-15-to-s16b-beats-estimates">net profit for its third quarter climbed 15 per cent</a>, boosted by loan growth, record fee income and higher trading gains, it said on Monday. Net profit for the three months ended Sept 30 stood at S$1.63 billion, up from S$1.41 billion for the year-ago period; while annualised earnings per share came in at S$2.50 for the quarter, up 15.7 per cent from S$2.16 a year ago. The bank's earnings was higher than the S$1.57 billion consensus forecast in a Refinitiv survey of five analysts. The counter closed at S$26.61 on Friday, down five cents or 0.2 per cent.</p>

      <p><b>Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage:</b> The regional auto dealer looks to <a href="https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/jardine-cc-to-privatise-malaysian-arm-for-rm906m">privatise its Malaysian arm</a> Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang Berhad (CCB) for RM90.6 million (S$29.8 million), or RM2.20 per share, the firm said in a bourse filing on Monday. Jardine C&amp;C currently holds about 59.1 per cent of Bursa Malaysia-listed CCB, whose shares were down 3 per cent or four sens to RM1.29 on Friday. Jardine C&amp;C shares closed down S$0.32 or 1 per cent to S$32.27 on Friday.</p>

      <p><b>Eagle Hospitality Trust (EHT):</b> EHT on Sunday night said it is still <a href="https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/eht-says-premature-to-assess-sponsors-estimate-of-queen-mary-repair-costs">"premature" to appoint its own expert</a> to separately evaluate and report on the costs of the maintenance of the Queen Mary floating hotel at this stage. This comes as the City of Long Beach, where the retired cruise ship is docked, has commissioned a local engineering firm to conduct a peer review of the monthly inspection reports of the ship by independent engineer Edward Pribonic. However, EHT's board will “consider all options” depending on the outcome of the City’s review of Urban Commons' proposal for critical repairs to the ship. Stapled securities of EHT closed at 45.5 US cents on Friday, down 0.5 cent. </p>

      <p><b>Hiap Hoe:</b> Lower sales of development properties and higher expenses <a href="https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/hiap-hoe-q3-net-profit-falls-82">resulted in an 82 per cent dive in net profit</a> for Hiap Hoe in the third quarter ended Sept 30, the property developer announced on Friday. Net profit was S$114,000 compared with S$633,000 a year ago, although Q3 revenue shrank 16.3 per cent to S$35.3 million from S$42.1 million.

      <hr/>
