      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T09:48:43+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 09:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Hong%20Kong" target="_blank">Coconuts Hong Kong</a></address>
      <p>A cop who was caught on camera <a href="https://coconuts.co/hongkong/news/at-least-2-injured-after-police-motorbike-drives-into-protesters-at-kwai-fong/">driving his motorcycle into a crowd of protesters in Kwai Fong this morning</a> has been suspended, Hong Kong police have confirmed.</p>
      <p>The incident, which took place at about 8am this morning, saw at least two people injured after the officer used his bike to circle back and zig-zag through a crowd of black-clad protesters who had gathered on Hing Fong Road in Kwai Fong as flash protests took off across the city.</p>
      <p>Chief Superintendent John Tse from the Police Public Relations Bureau confirmed that the officer in question was “suspended from all frontline duties instantly and has taken leave instantly.”</p>

      <p>Speaking to reporters this afternoon, Tse maintained that the officer was trying to come to the aid of his colleagues and create some distance between protesters and officers.</p>
      <p>“A rioter sprayed an unknown liquid at a police officer’s face, causing temporary loss of vision. Later, one officer drove his motorbike to approach the site to render assistance, in an attempt to separate rioters and the police officers. During the process, the officer was attacked with a hammer.”</p>
      <p>He added that Hong Kong police understood the seriousness of the incident, and added that the case was being investigated by the New Territories South police district, adding “if any misconducts arises, the police will certainly follow up.”</p>
      <p>Tse’s comments come as the city enters another week of protests, which have become increasingly tense after <a href="https://coconuts.co/hongkong/news/student-who-fell-from-tseung-kwan-o-car-park-dies/">a university student passed away</a> on Friday after succumbing to a brain injury sustained in a fall at a car park during a police dispersal operation a week ago today. Thousands <a href="https://coconuts.co/hongkong/news/thousands-hold-vigils-as-hong-kong-students-death-triggers-outrage/">attended a vigil for the student</a>, named Chow Tsz-lok, in Tamar Park on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Today’s citywide boycott of work and classes has so far seen an officer fire live ammunition in Sai Wan Ho that <a href="https://coconuts.co/hongkong/news/at-least-one-protester-shot-with-live-round-as-citywide-boycott-hits-city/">left a protester in critical condition</a>, and <a href="https://coconuts.co/hongkong/news/man-set-on-fire-in-ma-on-shan-following-apparent-argument/">one man set on fire in Ma On Shan following an apparent argument</a>, in addition to numerous volleys of tear gas fired across the city.</p>
