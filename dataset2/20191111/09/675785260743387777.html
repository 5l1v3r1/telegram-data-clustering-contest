      <h1>Premier League highlights: 10 talking points as Liverpool extend lead with Man City win</h1>
      <h2>Liverpool continued their unbeaten run and defeated Pep Guardiola's champions, while Leicester saw off Arsenal and Chelsea continued their impressive form</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T09:05:30+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 09:05</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Lewis, James Nursey, Alex Richards, Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-lewis/, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/james-nursey/, https://www.facebook.com/AARichards/, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/, Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool's grip at the top of the Premier League table tightened on Sunday with a 3-1 win over champions <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> at Anfield.</p>
      <p>Fabinho, Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane all found the net as Jurgen Klopp's side extended their lead at the top of the table.</p>
      <p>City's defeat saw Pep Guardiola's men fall to fourth, after victories on Saturday for both <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> City and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> , against Arsenal and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> respectively.</p>
      <p>Sheffield United are upto fifth after a draw at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> , while <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> , Wolves, Burnley and Newcastle all claimed home wins.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/watford-fc">Watford</a> - claiming their first win over the season - were the only victors on the road this weekend, defeating the two sides who are now the division's bottom two: <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> and Norwich.</p>
      <p>Here are 10 talking points from the weekend...</p>
      <h3>1. Pulisic flying for Chelsea</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Captain America is a different player to the early weeks of the season when a his lack of playing time affected his confidence and his performances.</p>
      <p>Right from the start here he was in the faces of the Eagles with his quick feet reminiscent of his predecessor Eden Hazard.</p>
      <p>His 56th-minute run and drive, pushed over the bar by Vicente Guaita, almost had the majority of Stamford Bridge on their feet.</p>
      <p>His close range header on 79 minutes did. Pulisic has some way to go before he hits those Hazard heights but his displays right now are suggesting he is very much on the right track.</p>
      <h3>2. West Ham continue to miss Fabianski</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20848131.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Burnley-FC-v-West-Ham-United-Premier-League.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <p>They say absence makes the heart grow fonder, and if that is indeed the case then Lukasz Fabianski may well be Lev Yashin in the eyes of some <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> fans right now.</p>
      <p>The Polish goalkeeper was outstanding during his debut season at the London Stadium last term, and having seen them without him in recent weeks due to injury, you do wonder how many points he earned the Hammers last term.</p>
      <p>On Saturday his deputy, Roberto, was all over the place at Turf Moor as the Irons fell to a 3-0 defeat to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/burnley-fc">Burnley</a> . The Spaniard's decision on the stroke of half-time - at 1-0 down - to throw the ball out to a defender who had no knowledge of what was around him, was bone-headed and ended the game as a contest.</p>
      <p>His flap for the own goal early in the second half was weak as Manuel Pellegrini's side sank to defeat. Fans cannot wait for Fabianski to return.</p>
      <h3>3. Time running out on Ralph?</h3>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>How long does Hasenhuttl have left? (Image: Jordan Mansfield)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Ralph Hasenhuttl arrived at Southampton with a fine reputation following his work in Germany with both Ingolstadt and RB Leipzig, and did an excellent job in keeping the Saints up last season</p>
      <p>But amid more behind the scenes changes and turmoil at St Mary's, and with fan disaffection growing on the south coast, he looks to be a dead man walking.</p>
      <p>The hope was that the Austrian's side could build on the narrow loss to Manchester City last weekend by picking up points in their first home game since the 9-0 reverse against Leicester.</p>
      <p>Instead, it was another damp squib. The side looks low on confidence and are struggling to create quality chances.</p>
      <h3>4. No stopping Vardy</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Jamie Vardy took his tally for the season to 11 goals at the top of the goal scoring charts above 10-goal Tammy Abraham.</p>
      <p>Vardy clearly loves playing against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> as he has now scored nine goals in his nine league starts against them.</p>
      <p>His tally of 20 Premier League goals in 22 games since boss Brendan Rodgers' arrival in February is five more than anyone else during that period.</p>
      <p>He scored the opener in the 68th minute after capping a fine team move with a first time right-foot finish and was only denied a second by a fine save by Bernd Leno.</p>
      <p>But he still found time to assist James Maddison to make it 2-0.</p>
      <h3>5. Pressure rising on Emery</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Arsenal's loss took Unai Emery to 50 games in charge in the Premier League; his record stands at who had a record of W25, D12, L13.</p>
      <p>Again there was a formation change, this time a back three getting a domestic run out. Again he used Mesut Ozil, despite the club hierarchy seemingly being keen to push the German out.</p>
      <p>And again, the end product was entirely predictable.</p>
      <h3>6. Terrific Traore inspires Wolves to derby win</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20856713.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Wolverhampton-Wanderers-v-Aston-Villa-Premier-League.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <p>There are few more terrifying sights for Premier League defenders than Adama Traore in full flow and the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> winger was at his destructive best in Wolves' 2-1 win over Aston Villa at Molineux.</p>
      <p>Up against his former club and celebrating a call-up to the senior Spain squad (he has since pulled out due to injury), in-form Traore was too hot to handle for the Villans.</p>
      <p>Matt Targett endured a nightmare first half up against Traore, who has been Wolves' player of the season so far, time and again being skinned by the ex-Middlesbrough man; to be fair to Targett, he was far from the only one.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/article20857673.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Adama-Traore-dribbles.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <p>Traore completed 13 of 17 dribbles during an excellent display, and also showcased a new-found composure in the final third - something he's been working on with coaching staff in the Black Country.</p>
      <p>Diogo Jota should have scored when Traore crossed and found the Portuguese four yards from goal; Raul Jimenez made no mistake after Traore's lung-busting 60-yard run and cut-back late in the day.</p>
      <h3>7. Williams impresses on Premier League debut</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20854053.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_9f4c74c1-29b8-47a7-bbe5-581396df4a32.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Brandon Williams impressed against Brighton</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Brandon Williams became only the second United player born after the year 2000 to play in the Premier League, but he looked far more senior than his 19 years would have you believe.</p>
      <p>After holding his own in the Europa League and Carabao Cup Ole Gunnar Solskjaer put his faith in the local lad for today’s game, and the academy graduate didn’t let him down.</p>
      <p>He seemed to grow in confidence after making an early tackle by the corner flag which had the Old Trafford faithful roaring their approval, and although he didn’t offer huge amounts going forward, he was solid defensively throughout.</p>
      <p>He was, however, perhaps lucky to stay on the pitch after an over-enthusiastic high challenge in the second-half that on another day could have seen him given his marching orders rather than receiving just a yellow.</p>
      <p>With Ashley Young ageing and Luke Shaw in and out of the side with injuries there is a real chance for Williams to make that left-back position his own.</p>
      <p>On this showing there is every chance he could do just that.</p>
      <h3>8. Fabulous Fabinho shows another side to his game</h3>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Fabinho was outstanding for the Reds (Image: Action Images via Reuters)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Fabinho has quickly earned cult hero status at Anfield after becoming an integral part of Jurgen Klopp's philosophy at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> .</p>
      <p>Having bounced back from a slow start to his Reds career last season, the Brazilian's no-nonsense play in the middle of the park, coupled with his work ethic, is something that has rightly pleased fans.</p>
      <p>However one area of his game that he hasn't often displayed is his goalscoring prowess, having notched just one goal - in a routine 4-0 win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> last term - ahead of Sunday's clash.</p>
      <p>But he doubled his tally against City - and in superb fashion, too.</p>
      <p>Having occupied a position on the edge of the area, the former Monaco man let fly with a stunning strike that left Bravo with no chance.</p>
      <p>What a way to open his account for the season.</p>
      <h3>9. Aguero’s Anfield hoodoo</h3>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Anfield and Aguero don't mix (Image: Action Images via Reuters)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Sergio Aguero made his 250th Premier League appearance for City at a stadium where he hasn't enjoyed much success.</p>
      <p>Despite scoring a remarkable 173 top-flight goals, the Argentine superstar had never notched a goal at Liverpool's hostile home.</p>
      <p>Could he change that on Sunday? Unfortunately not. Although it could have been a different story had City been awarded the penalty that arguably deserved in the first half.</p>
      <p>But it wasn't to be - and Aguero was unable to pose the attacking threat that has seen him become the club's all-time record goalscorer.</p>
      <p>The former Atletico Madrid star was hauled off in the 71st minute and replaced by Gabriel Jesus, capping off a miserable evening for Aguero.</p>
      <h3>10. VAR</h3>
      <p>Yep. Again.</p>
      <p>Remember when it was brought in to clear everything up? (sighs).</p>
      <p>What a mess.</p>
