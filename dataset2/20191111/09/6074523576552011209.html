      <h1>Ex-Cinnober Blockchain Lead Joins Nordic Crypto Fund to Bet Big on Bitcoin</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T09:00:21+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author">Anna Baydakova</a></address>
      <p>Since NASDAQ <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/about/press-center/nasdaq-acquire-cinnober">acquired</a> Cinnober last year, blockchain lead Eric Wall has left the exchange business for a bitcoin investment fund, joining the Oslo, Norway-based Arcane Crypto, he told CoinDesk.</p>
      <p>Aimed at high net worth Scandinavians and institutional investors globally, the fund is an investment branch of Arcane, a crypto firm running a technology team, trading arm and a crypto news portal Kryptografen.com.</p>
      <p>Arcane Crypto CEO Torbjorn Bull Jenssen is a widely cited crypto expert in Norway and a <a href="https://kryptografen.no/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Institutionalisation-of-Bitcoin-Arcane-Research-2019-1.pdf">white paper published earlier this year</a> shows their team is watching the industry closely, but doesn’t provide any clues to the investment strategy.</p>
      <p>Wall said that he could not disclose precisely which assets will be Arcane’s focus, but that outperformance separate from the revaluation of bitcoin would be the metric:</p>
      <blockquote>“I expect that the metric that really matters is how funds perform against bitcoin. Once the dust starts to settle on that, it’s going to be clear who’s been swimming naked.”</blockquote>
      <p>Some altcoin could also make it into Arcane’s portfolio, Wall hinted, but only those strictly selected:</p>
      <blockquote>“We are seeing a maturing trend in the altcoin market. It’s already very different now than it was a few years ago. It’s becoming harder and harder for technically inept projects to fake-it-til-you-make-it. There’s only in a very few, select areas in the cryptocurrency design space that has merit to compete against bitcoin.”</blockquote>
      <p>Rather than measuring performance against fiat, the goal is to trade digital currencies to increase the size of the portfolio, in bitcoin.</p>
      <p>Arcane Crypto was founded by Norwegian investors Ketil Skorstad and Kristian G. Lundqvist, and also <a href="https://nordic9.com/news/arcane-crypto-added-capital-investment-from-morten-klein-news1720438526/">funded</a> by Morten Klein, a poker player and chairman of the Swedish <a href="https://cherry.se/">casinos company Cherry</a>, in an undisclosed round this April.</p>
      <p>All three investors are from Norway, hence the Scandinavian slant of the fund.</p>
      <p>Wall had spent more than three years at Cinnober, a company selling tech solutions for stock and crypto exchanges, and was used to explaining crypto to people in traditional finance, but in English, not in Norwegian</p>
      <p>“We will have a special focus on the Nordics, but it’s not exclusive,” Wall added.</p>
