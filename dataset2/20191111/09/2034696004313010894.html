      <p>The #Grime4Corbyn movement is unlikely to return once more for the upcoming general election, after several key figures reportedly grew disillusioned with Jeremy Corbyn.</p>
      <p>The movement, which was part of an effort to encourage young people to vote during the 2017 general election, is now considered to be a missed opportunity by several acts who backed the campaign.</p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/10/grime4corbyn-artists-step-back-from-new-campaign-for-labour">The Guardian</a>, acts view the campaign as being a “one-off” despite grime stars such as Krucial previously stressing that it should not be a “viral trend” that ends after election season.</p>
      <p>One grime manager told the publication: “The general consensus is that they were used. They didn’t follow up. They weren’t expecting a general election so soon, and it’s a bit late to go to the grime community now after ignoring us.”</p>

      <p>JME and Jeremy Corbyn</p>
      <p>Other acts such as AJ Tracey have confirmed that they will not be voting for Labour in December, while JME – who interviewed Mr Corbyn – did not respond to request for comment.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/skepta">Skepta</a><a href="https://www.nme.com/politics/skepta-slams-current-state-politics-grime4corbyn-movement-2185457"> previously criticised the campaign in December 2017</a>, and said that politicians “used people” during the election.</p>
      <p>He said: “When [the general election] was happening, everybody that mattered started to fucking support politics and tell people to vote for people,” Skepta told <a href="https://www.qthemusic.com/">Q</a>.</p>
      <p>“They’re fucking saying ‘vote for this person, check politics and shit out’. I’m like, ‘are you lot fucking stupid brother?’</p>
      <p>He continued: “We’re four months or whatever later and no one gives a shit about it now, bruv.”</p>
      <p>In July, MC Lethal Bizzle also <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/lethal-bizzle-tells-jeremy-corbyn-resign-2532589">called on Corbyn to stand down as Labour leader.</a></p>
