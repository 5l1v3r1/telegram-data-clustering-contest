      <p>The UK economy avoided entering a recession after it grew by 0.3% in the third quarter of this year, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the ONS said: "GDP grew steadily in the third quarter, mainly thanks to a strong July.</p>
      <p>"Services again led the way with construction also performing well. Manufacturing failed to grow as falls in most industries were offset by car production bouncing back following April shutdowns.</p>
      <p>"The underlying trade deficit narrowed, mainly due to growing exports of both goods and services."</p>
