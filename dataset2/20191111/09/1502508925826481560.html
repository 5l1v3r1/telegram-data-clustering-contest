      <h1>Striking the right balance: Uddhav's acid test ahead of govt formation</h1>
      <h2>Now, he will have to prove his credentials as a leader who can navigate a new political path with parties like the Congress and NCP, which are ideologically different</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T09:50:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 09:50</time> by <a rel="author">Press Trust of India</a></address>
      <p>With the Maharashtra governor inviting the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/shiv-sena">Shiv Sena </a>to stake claim, party chief <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/uddhav-thackeray">Uddhav Thackeray </a>now faces the biggest test of his political life to form a Sena-led government in the state, if the Congress and NCP decide to support him.</p>
      <p>Thackeray, 59, a regional leader, stood up and held his ground against a national party (BJP) over tussle for sharing power, a political analyst said on condition of anonymity.</p>
      <p>Now, he will have to prove his credentials as a leader who can navigate a new political path with parties like the Congress and NCP, which are ideologically different, he said.</p>
      <p>"The tie-up will be with a national party and it remains to be seen how he will convince (Congress president) Sonia Gandhi to support him. Will he soften the fiery Hindutva stand, which the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/shiv-sena">Shiv Sena </a>espouses, or will that be an obstacle, the coming days will tell," the analyst said.</p>
      <p>Another challenge for Thackeray will be whether to accept the post of chief minister, though there has been a clamour from some segments to project first time MLA and his son Aaditya as the party's chief ministerial face.<br/> </p>

      </p>
      <p>"There could be a crisis in the party if someone else is made (CM). There could be differences if another leader is appointed the chief minister," the analyst said.</p>
      <p>While Thackeray has shown political sagacity and maturity, the BJP will not sit quiet and may try to topple a Sena-led government, he claimed.</p>
      <p>"Uddhav will have to keep his flock of MLAs together," he said.</p>
      <p>Twenty years ago, Thackeray was seen as a reluctant politician, living a cosy life with his wife Rashmi and sons Aaditya and Tejas.</p>
      <p>The Sena leader, for whom photography is a passion, had set up an advertising agency called 'Chaurang'.</p>
      <p>Like Rajiv Gandhi, who started out in <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/politics">politics </a>by helping his mother Indira Gandhi, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/uddhav-thackeray">Uddhav Thackeray </a>began assisting his father Bal Thackeray at a time when the firebrand Sena patriarch was aging and the party's sphere was expanding, the analyst said.</p>
      <p>Amid new developments in the state's political arena after the recent Assembly polls, Thackeray's ability to lead his party with its traditional street-fighter aggression would now face an acid test, he added.</p>
