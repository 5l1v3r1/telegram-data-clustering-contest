      <p>On Sunday, right-arm pacer <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Deepak-Chahar">Deepak Chahar</a> entered the record books after his exceptional bowling helped India clinch the three-match T20I series over Bangladesh.</p>
      <p>Chahar finished with figures of 6/7 - the best figures by a bowler in T20I <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket">cricket</a> - as India won the third and final match by 30 runs against the Bangla Tigers at the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Vidarbha-Cricket-Association-Stadium">Vidarbha Cricket Association Stadium</a>.</p>
      <p>During his magical spell, Chahar also became the first Indian bowler to score a hat-trick in T20I cricket.</p>
      <p>Recovering at a steady pace from his injury, Bumrah recently brought to the fore his stylish self by "playing it cool" with a picture of him decked in casual formals on Instagram.</p>
      <p>Earlier, the pacer -- who missed the series against South Africa due to a stress fracture -- went through an assessment post the Diwali break which revealed that his recovery is on track and he is likely to be available for the New Zealand tour.</p>
      <p>Team India will be hosting both Sri Lanka and Australia in January before heading to New Zealand for two Tests, three ODIs and five T20Is.</p>
