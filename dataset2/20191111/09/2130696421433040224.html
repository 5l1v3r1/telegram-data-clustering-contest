      <p>US stocks forged higher on Friday and closed with new records for the second straight day despite being buffeted by fast-changing news in the US-China trade war.</p>
      <p>After spending much of the day in the red, the benchmark Dow Jones Industrial Average squeaked into positive territory, closing a fraction above Thursday's record close at 27,681.24.</p>
      <p>The broader S&amp;P 500 rose 0.3 per cent to end the week at 3,092.95 while the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.5 per cent, closing at 8,475.31.</p>
      <p>In Europe, shares broke a five-day winning streak on Friday as the pan-European Stoxx 600 index ended 0.3 per cent lower after gaining 2.5 per cent over the last five sessions. Defensive plays including healthcare and utilities were the only sectors to rise, suggesting appetite for risk remained muted.</p>
