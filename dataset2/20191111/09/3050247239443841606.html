      <h1>China’s State-Run Media: Bitcoin Is Blockchain’s First Success</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T09:38:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 09:38</time> by <a rel="author">Marie Huillet</a></address>
      <p>The official Chinese state-run Xinhua News Agency has published a report recognizing Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) as “the first successful application of blockchain technology.” </p>
      <p><a href="http://finance.sina.com.cn/blockchain/roll/2019-11-11/doc-iicezzrr8654358.shtml">Published</a> today, Nov. 11, the coverage is exceptional given China’s abiding <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/skirting-the-great-wall-the-chequered-saga-of-crypto-in-china-2013-2017">hardline stance</a> against decentralized cryptocurrencies, as epitomized by Beijing’s historic September 2017 blanket <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/breaking-all-chinese-bitcoin-exchanges-must-close-by-september-30">ban on crypto exchanges</a> and initial coin offerings.</p>
      <h3>Even-handed exposure</h3>
      <p>The Xinhua article is broadly positive and detailed in its coverage of Bitcoin and the history of its development and evolution.</p>
      <p>It opens by posing the question of whether the coin represents the “inevitable trend of future currency development or just another ‘tulip’ hype?” Given this formulation reproduces a long-standing industry platitude, it arguably leans more toward rhetorical convention than polemic.</p>
      <p>The article continues to describe the core principles of blockchain as a decentralized, immutable and trustless system for the peer-to-peer transfer of value, covering aspects such as mining, digital scarcity and pseudonymity.</p>
      <p>It is in regard to this latter — again, similarly to much Western mainstream media coverage of cryptocurrencies — that the article flags up the potential risks of Bitcoin, arguing that purportedly “the most important uses of Bitcoin payments are black market transactions and ‘dark net’ transactions.”</p>
      <p>Xinhua also emphasizes the volatility of Bitcoin as a currency that is not backed by a centralized sovereign power — as distinct from national fiat currencies. </p>
      <p>However, the article is notably free of hyperbole or demonization, prompting some readers to <a href="https://twitter.com/molllliy/status/1193710293857124353?s=20">propose</a> that the coverage represents the “first time Bitcoin got such positive exposure” from the Chinese government.</p>
      <h3>A turning tide?</h3>
      <p>As reported, President Xi’s recent <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/breaking-chinas-xi-jinping-urges-accelerated-blockchain-technology-adoption?utm_source=Telegram&amp;utm_medium=social">high-profile</a> endorsement of blockchain innovation in recent weeks was accompanied by the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/china-passes-first-ever-crypto-law-going-into-effect-january-2020">signing</a> of the first national law regulating cryptography, governing various aspects of blockchain, due to come into effect this January. </p>
      <p>The country’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China, is also <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/china-to-be-first-to-launch-digital-currency-says-think-tank-exec">expected</a> to become the first major global economy to launch a central bank digital currency as other countries, such as <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/tunisia-to-launch-e-dinar-national-currency-using-blockchain">Tunisia</a>, are already getting a head start. </p>
      <p>While state media has recently <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/china-warns-against-cryptocurrency-speculation-amid-blockchain-hype">reiterated</a> a cautious stance against speculative excesses in cryptocurrency trading, the country is nonetheless appearing to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/china-veteran-regulator-tells-sichuan-to-tap-hydropower-for-blockchain">tone down</a> its erstwhile stringent opposition to activities such as Bitcoin mining.</p>
