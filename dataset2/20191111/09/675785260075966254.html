      <p>Boxing promoter Eddie Hearn has revealed that six celebrities have been in contact over a big-money boxing showdown against KSI.</p>
      <p>Britain's YouTube superstar won his six-round cruiserweight bout against fellow YouTube personality Logan Paul in Los Angeles on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>The fight at the Staples Centre was won by Watford man KSI, whose real name is Olajide Olayinka Williams JJ Olatunji, in a split decision - 55-56 57-54 56-55.</p>
      <p>And Hearn, the Matchroom Boxing promoter, has claimed that the biggest names in sport, music and acting have shown interest in fighting the Brit.</p>
      <p>Hearn said: "I've had five or six calls this week from probably the highest-profile people in their fields; from sport, music, acting...</p>
      <p>"They said, 'don't say anything, but could I fight the winner?' So now we have to look at that and by the way two or three of them can really fight."</p>

      <p>When asked if he could give any names, Hearn replied: "No, I promised I wouldn't.</p>
      <p>"For now it was an experiment that went really well and I really enjoyed it.</p>
      <p>"People criticised it. Then people started getting on board. Then people started benefiting from the numbers and the audience. Next thing, everybody loves it.</p>
      <p>"We'll digest, we'll review it as always, we'll plan a strategy.</p>

      <p>“Justin Bieber, I’d destroy him. It’d be nothing.</p>
      <p>“This boy doesn’t know how to fight or anything combat, so let him just stick to singing.</p>
      <p>“I destroyed Logan Paul, why would I fight Justin Bieber?”</p>
