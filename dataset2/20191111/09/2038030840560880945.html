      <p>Stockholm - New York rapper A$AP Rocky will return to Sweden for a concert, its promoter said on Friday, despite an assault conviction that sparked diplomatic tensions and fan fury.</p>
      <p>"After massive support from the Swedish fans he is returning to Stockholm for an anticipated concert," entertainment company Live Nation said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The event is scheduled for 11 December at the Ericsson Globe arena.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old rapper, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, was arrested on 3 July following a street fight in Stockholm on 30 June in which he and his entourage were embroiled with a 19-year-old plaintiff.</p>
      <p>Considered a "flight risk", Mayers was held in custody for a month while the case was investigated and throughout his trial.</p>
      <p>But he was released after the close of proceedings on 2 August, pending the verdict, and immediately returned to the United States.</p>
      <p>In mid August the Stockholm District Court announced it had found him, along with two members of his entourage, guilty and <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/Music/News/us-rapper-aap-rocky-gets-suspended-sentence-for-assault-20190814"><b>handed them suspended sentences.</b></a></p>
      <p>Part of the brawl was captured in a video, published by <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/07/31/asap-rocky-bodyguard-chokeslam-video-alleged-victim-mustafa-jafari/"><b>US celebrity news outlet TMZ,</b></a> where the rapper can be seen throwing a young man to the ground and aiming several punches at him while he is down.</p>
      <p>The artists claimed he acted in self-defense, saying he felt "scared" after the young man had followed and harrassed the group.</p>
      <p>Mayers also posted videos of his own to Instagram - purporting to show the lead up to the fight - where the young man can be seen following the group and asking about a pair of headphones despite being asked to walk the other way.</p>
      <p>Mayers' imprisonment outraged fans, who started an online petition called #JusticeForRocky, which garnered more than 640 000 signatures.</p>
      <p>Supporters were urged to boycott Swedish brands such as Ikea.</p>
      <p>The case also led to diplomatic tensions after US President Donald Trump himself called for Mayers to be released.</p>
      <p>"Give A$AP Rocky his FREEDOM. We do so much for Sweden but it doesn't seem to work the other way around," Trump wrote in a July tweet and added the hashtag #FreeRocky.</p>

      <p>The US president had a direct phone call with Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven, who reportedly emphasised that Sweden's judiciary was independent.</p>
      <p>Trump also sent then US Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs and current National Security Advisor Robert C. O'Brien to attend the trial.</p>
