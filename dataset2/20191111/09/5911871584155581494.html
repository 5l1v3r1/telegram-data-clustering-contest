      <p>Back in 2011, after three albums and eight years as a band, the Montreal indie rock heroes broke up. They <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/1853250/wolf-parade-tease-2016-return/news/">reunited</a> in 2016 and released the comeback LP <i><a href="https://www.stereogum.com/1964061/premature-evaluation-wolf-parade-cry-cry-cry/franchises/premature-evaluation/">Cry Cry Cry</a></i> in 2017. Since then, the various members of the band have mostly kept busy with their various side projects. But last month, Wolf Parade released a new song called “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2061533/wolf-parade-against-the-day-video/video/">Against The Day</a>,” which featured co-leaders Spencer Krug and Dan Boeckner singing lead. At the time, it appeared to be a one-off single. But today, we learn that there’s a whole new Wolf Parade album on the way, and we get another new jam to boot.</p>
      <p>Sometime in the not-too-distant future, Wolf Parade will release the new LP <i>Thin Mind</i>, their fifth. The band — now a trio after the departure of Dante DeCaro — worked on the album with the veteran indie rock producer John Goodmanson, who also manned the boards on <i>Cry Cry Cry</i>. “Against The Day” is on the album, and so is a new song called “Forest Green.”</p>
      <p>“Forest Green” is one of the songs where Dan Boeckner sings lead, and like most Boeckner songs, it’s a rocker. Boeckner delivers the lyrics in a sort of gravelly hiccup over a driving twang-riff and an explosive synth. The song has echoes of ’60s garage rock and ’80s Springsteen. But mostly, it just sounds like old Wolf Parade. Listen below.</p>
