      <h1>Virgil van Dijk sends title warning to Liverpool teammates after Man City triumph</h1>
      <h2>Liverpool are now eight points clear at the top of the Premier League table following their hard-fought 3-1 win over Manchester City</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T09:00:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author">John Cross, https://www.facebook.com/johncrossmirror/</a></address>
      <p>Virgil van Dijk has warned Manchester City can still come back in the title race as he insisted they must accept VAR decisions.</p>
      <p>City boss Pep Guardiola angrily remonstrated with the officials as big decisions cost his team dear at Anfield, with the reigning champions falling nine points behind <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> .</p>
      <p>It now gives Liverpool a huge advantage in the battle to be crowned champions for the first time in 30 years but the Dutch defender says they know from experience it is far from over.</p>
      <p>City made up eight points to win the title last year but will need another miracle to peg back red-hot Liverpool this time.</p>

      <p>Van Dijk said: “They are the champions first of all so they will definitely be up there again. The other teams have been doing well. The only thing we focus on is the game ahead of us, it's pretty boring that I keep saying it, but it is actually a fact. Let's just go for it.</p>
      <p>“We have so many games left. The busy period is still to come: December is unbelievably busy. Then we have January and February and you never know what can happen.</p>
      <p>“We want everyone to be fit and at their best but you can't be at your best every other day. Hopefully we will do it but we can't think about it.</p>
      <p>“It's like any other three points of course but it was a bit special because you are playing against the champions, your direct rival, and I think it was a very good game to watch. Obviously we are very happy to get the three points.</p>

      <p>“We all know and we all feel there are so many games left that so many things can happen between now and May. The only thing which can happen is for everyone to stay fit and need everyone to play as well as they can.</p>
      <p>“We are very happy with the position we are in but we cannot take it for granted. We just have to keep going and take it game-by-game.</p>
      <p>“It is not a nice feeling if you go into the international break having dropped points – especially at home – so we were very good and we had to be if we were going to get the three points.”</p>

      <p>But once again, VAR played a big part as City were screaming for a penalty when Raheem Sterling’s cross hit Trent Alexander-Arnold’s hand - but Liverpool raced up the other end and Fabinho scored 22 seconds later.</p>
      <p>The VAR did not intervene and overrule referee Michael Oliver’s decision and City were also denied another handball claim against Alexander-Arnold in the second half.</p>
      <p>Van Dijk added: “Every goal you have to wait now, I wasn't even celebrating I think. At the end the VAR gives it so we just keep carrying on, we can't change anything.</p>
      <p>“I think I saw Bernardo Silva hitting it first and maybe Trent hit it as well. I could say a lot of things but if VAR gives it we have to accept it.”</p>
