      <p>BAGHDAD: Four protesters have been killed and some 130 wounded in clashes between security forces and protesters in a southern city, according to a rights group in Iraq.The semi-official Iraqi High Commission for Human Rights described on Monday the previous day’s incidents in the city of Nasiryah as “regrettable,” adding that some of the wounded are in serious conditions.At least 320 protesters have been killed by security forces since the protests and unrest over living conditions began last month.The Nasiriyah casualties occurred during confrontations outside the education directorate as security forces tear-gassed protesters trying to block employees from reaching the building in the city center.The demonstrators complain of widespread corruption, lack of job opportunities and poor basic services, including regular power cuts, despite Iraq’s vast oil reserves.
