      <h2>Leftists in Canada succeeded in getting Canadian hockey icon Don Cherry fired after he made comments about the lack of poppies worn for Remembrance Day by recent immigrants in Ontario.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T20:39:42+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 20:39</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Tomlinson</a></address>
      <p>The 85-year-old hockey veteran <a href="https://twitter.com/thescore/status/1193978076075642880?s=21">was fired</a> on Remembrance Day by broadcaster Sportsnet after comments made over the weekend.</p>
      <p>Cherry, who is well-known as a firebrand with Conservative opinions, made his comments on the Coach’s Corner segment of Hockey Night in Canada over the weekend alongside long-time co-host Ron MacLean during a game between the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Philadelphia Fliers, the <i>National Post</i> <a href="https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/don-cherry-hnic-you-people-hockey-coachs-corner">reports</a>.</p>
      <p>“You people … love our way of life, you love our milk and honey. At least you could pay a couple of bucks for a poppy,” Cherry said and added, “These guys paid for your way of life, the life you enjoy in Canada. These guys paid the biggest price.”</p>

      <p>According to the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Council, the number of complaints about Cherry’s remarks was so high that it ended up “exceeding the CBSC’s technical processing capacities.”</p>
      <p>The comments also received an immediate backlash on Canadian social media with leftists calling for Cherry to be fired from his position with broadcaster Sportsnet with hashtags #DonCherryMustGo and #FireDonCherry trending on Twitter.</p>
      <p>The former president of <a href="https://www.opencanada.org/contributors/laurendh/">Planned Parenthood</a> in Ottawa turned political consultant Lauren Dobson-Hughes slammed the hockey legend <a href="https://twitter.com/ldobsonhughes/status/1193539824998854656?s=20">saying</a>, “He’s a lifelong, unrepentant, irredeemable racist who’ll never change. We shouldn’t bother trying, he just needs to be thrown in a dumpster.”</p>
      <p>Leftist Ishmael N. Daro, who has written for publications such as <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/author/ishmaeldaro">Buzzfeed</a>, went even further claiming that poppies were racist.</p>

      <p>“This is exactly why I don’t wear a poppy. Even apart from the militarism that is inextricably part of the whole ritual, poppy fanaticism is often just barely disguised white supremacist rhetoric about “real Canadians” vs. ungrateful interlopers,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/iD4RO/status/1193413851687116806">said</a> on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Broadcaster Sportsnet was quick to <a href="https://torontosun.com/sports/hockey/nhl/sportsnet-apologizes-for-don-cherrys-comments-on-coachs-corner/wcm/809b8c82-3869-40cf-b294-68d50454fa2e">apologize</a> for Cherry’s comments, putting out a statement saying, “Don’s discriminatory comments are offensive and they do not represent our values and what we stand for as a network.”</p>
      <p>“We have spoken with Don about the severity of this issue and we sincerely apologize for these divisive remarks,” they added.</p>
      <p>Ron MacLean, himself an icon of hockey and sport across the country, also apologized for Cherry’s remarks <a href="https://twitter.com/RonMacLeanHTH/status/1193674011248644096?s=20">saying</a>, “I have worked with Don for 30 years, and we both love hockey. But last night, I know we failed you. I see hockey as part of what unites us. I have the honour of travelling across our country to celebrate Canada’s game, and our diversity is one of our country’s greatest strengths.”</p>

      <p>Mr Cherry, meanwhile, has <a href="https://torontosun.com/news/local-news/warmington-no-apology-from-don-cherry-on-hnic-poppy-comments">refused to apologize</a> for his statements, with the 85-year-old telling the <i>Toronto Sun</i> newspaper, “I have had my say.”</p>
      <p>On Remembrance Day, the hashtag #DonCherryIsRight began to trend in Ontario with several petitions by conservative news outlets in Canada set up to support the hockey icon and garnering <a href="https://www.rebelnews.com/support-don-cherry-petition">thousands</a> of signatures.</p>
