      <p>It's that time of year again. You know the one: where you want to spoil the people you love, but you <i>also</i> have to stick to a budget. And on top of that, you're sick of gifting the same tired old options like quick-forgotten gift cards and dusty bottles of wine.</p>
      <p>If your shopping list is as long as mine, then getting it all done can bring on a special kind of stress. But I'm here to tell you that you can skip all of that this year. When you're making your list and checking it twice, rest assured there are plenty of ways to level up on the gifts you give — <i>without</i> breaking the bank.</p>
      <p>Bustle teamed up with <a href="https://woodwick.yankeecandle.com/">WoodWick</a> to put together an inspired list of luxe options for everyone on your nice list. They have all the makings of a good splurge — <i>without</i> the guilt behind the spend. Happy holiday shopping!</p>
      <h3>1. The Throw To End All Throws</h3>
      <p>This ultra soft throw has a high-end look at a just-right price, making it the ideal gift for friends who are always cold. With one side featuring soft velvet, and the other featuring plush sherpa, this blanket doesn't just offer the most comfortable experience ever — it also offers options. And who doesn't love options?</p>

      <h3>2. This Tumbler Is What Dreams Are Made Of</h3>
      <p>Travel mugs are a must, but the name brand price points are not. This tumbler keeps hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold for longer than other options out there, <i>plus</i> it comes in at a fraction of the cost. And seriously — what's better than giving your loved ones the gift of hot coffee that's still hot hours later?</p>

      <h3>3. Give The Gift Of The Best Candle Ever</h3>
      <p>WoodWick candles are pure, luxurious joy. No matter if you're shopping for a co-worker, a friend, or a family member, your giftee will love the indulgent fragrances and unforgettable sound of the crackling wick. I recommend the Fireside candle as a solid option: It features elevated notes of amber, vetiver, and musk. Hot tip: Buy a second one for yourself. You deserve it.</p>

      <p>An elegant, oversized mug with an undersized price? Yes, please! This one's an easy choice for its Japanese-inspired painting motif <i>and</i> because honestly, it's big enough to double as a bowl. (Did someone say ice cream?) But the best part is that it's microwave- and dishwasher-safe, which means it looks fancy while still being totally suitable for real life.</p>
