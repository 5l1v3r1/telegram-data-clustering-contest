      <h1>SANParks tight-lipped on suspension of senior Kruger National Park ranger</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T20:04:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 20:04</time> by <a rel="author">Buks Viljoen</a></address>
      <p>SANParks is remaining tight-lipped about the suspension of one of the Kruger National Park's most senior and respected game rangers, Don English.</p>
      <p>English and a colleague, Victor Magakwe, were suspended on October 11 for the alleged assault and mistreatment of rangers and suspected poachers after complaints were filed by another game ranger.</p>
      <p>The ranger, a corporal whose name is known to News24, was also apparently suspended prior to English and Magakwe's case for his alleged involvement in rhino poaching.</p>
      <p>It is understood the corporal had been on the anti-poaching authorities' radar for quite a while.</p>
      <p>News24 understands, he and another ranger were arrested in September during a sting operation when an illegal weapon was found in his tent in a bush camp.</p>
      <p>This could, however, not be officially confirmed by SANParks or the Mpumalanga police.</p>
      <p>The ranger, whose own case is pending, registered a complaint with his union. It is understood that he is not in custody while the case is being investigated.</p>
      <p>Following his complaint, the EFF allegedly became involved, leading to the park's management taking action against Magakwe and English.</p>
      <p>English, who has been working at Kruger for most of his career, is one of the rangers closely involved in the fight against rhino poaching.</p>
      <p>SANParks spokesperson Ike Phaahla confirmed the two men had been suspended but refused to reveal more details.</p>
      <p>Phaahla said when SANParks became aware of the allegations against English and Magakwe, advocate Boyce Mkhize was appointed as an independent consultant to handle the case.</p>
      <p>According to him the investigation had been finalised, but management was still studying the outcome "to understand the facts".</p>
      <p>"There might even be more suspensions later," said Phaahla.</p>
      <p>He could not say when, and if, disciplinary hearings would be held.</p>
      <p>There is currently uncertainty among the rhino poaching investigation teams, as well as the legal and prosecuting authorities on how the case might impact on numerous high-profile poaching cases in which English is a key witness.</p>
