      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will chair a meeting of the government’s emergency ‘COBR’ committee on Tuesday to discuss the response to flooding in the north of England, his office said.</p>
      <p>The Environment Agency has more than 40 flood warnings in place, with residents in parts of northern England last week advised to evacuate their homes after deluges brought a month’s rainfall in less than 24 hours.</p>
