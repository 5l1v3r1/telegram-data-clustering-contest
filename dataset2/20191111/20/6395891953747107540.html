      <p><b>BOSTON</b> - Starting Tuesday, Nov. 12, medical marijuana patients in Massachusetts will be able to buy THC vaping products again. This, after a <a href="https://www.boston25news.com/news/judge-rules-gov-baker-dph-overstepped-authority-in-vaping-ban/1005444298">judge ruled</a> that only the state's Cannabis Control Commission has the authority to regulate marijuana and that Governor Charlie Baker's ban was out of line. </p>
      <p>Last Thursday, the CCC chose not to uphold Baker's vaping ban for medical marijuana patients, allowing for sales for patients to begin again at 12:01 p.m. Tuesday. </p>

      <p>Boston 25 News reporter Julianne Lima spoke with CCC Commissioner Shaleen Title on Monday who says while nothing is set in stone yet, she expects medical marijuana to be able to buy vaporizers for raw cannabis flower starting Tuesday. These devices were pulled off store shelves when Baker implemented the ban back in September, forcing many patients to find new ways to take their medicine. </p>
      <p>Right now, it appears that not all vaping products will be available Tuesday, with oil-based cartridges seemingly still off-limits. In the CCC meeting Thursday, Executive Director Shawn Collins suggested they would likely not allow medical patients to buy these products and would likely choose to quarantine them for the time being. </p>
      <p>The Baker Administration appealed the judge's order and asked for a temporary stay on the ruling, but there's no word yet on the court's decision. Baker declined to comment at an event Monday.</p>
