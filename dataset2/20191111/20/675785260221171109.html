      <h1>Jordan Henderson has proven me wrong - he's become intrinsic part of Liverpool's success</h1>
      <h2>Liverpool went eight points clear at the top of the table as they dismantled their biggest rivals Manchester City in their Premier League clash on Sunday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T20:14:30+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 20:14</time> by <a rel="author">Stan Collymore, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/stan-collymore/</a></address>
      <p>Put away the bunting and the parade-route plans because the title hasn’t been decided yet.</p>
      <p>And only those who don’t truly understand football will think <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool’s</a> 3-1 victory over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> on Sunday means anything different.</p>
      <p>I said before the game that you wouldn’t find any bookies paying out on my old club as champions this week if they won at Anfield.</p>
      <p>And even though they did run out winners with a terrific performance you still won’t find me anointing Liverpool just a third of the way into the season.</p>
      <p>Give me a nine-point gap over City on April Fool’s Day, and on Leicester and Chelsea for that matter, and maybe we can talk about it then.</p>

      <p>But until then, no chance, no chance at all.</p>
      <p>What a game it was, though, and what a shame the result was mired in controversy.</p>
      <p>We ought to have been celebrating two great teams and an exhilarating game for the rest of the week, and talking about nothing else.</p>
      <p>But the way technology has taken centre stage this season, that was never going to be the case and so it proved.</p>
      <p>Pep Guardiola and his City stars were right to claim handball against Trent Alexander-Arnold — it should have been given and why it wasn’t is anyone’s guess.</p>

      <p>But that’s the problem with VAR, it’s an absolute mess, and the Premier League and referees in England are starting to look unfit for purpose because of it.</p>
      <p>The indecisiveness and nit-picking of it all is missing the point completely and it’s detracting from the overall performances of such as Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson, who helped Liverpool win the game from the wide areas just as I suspected they would.</p>
      <p>Those two have rightly taken the plaudits but I want to pick out Jordan Henderson, who is so far removed from the player many of us thought he was three or four years ago.</p>
      <p>He can fill in centrally and still make up width and that is a nod to the exceptional tactics of Jurgen Klopp, who knows his two young full-backs will sometimes get overloaded and need a bit of help.</p>

      <p>I was one of those who looked at Henderson and James Milner and wondered if they’d be the two who could hamper the team.</p>
      <p>Milner has been round the block and has always been a great pro, but I wasn’t sure he’d add another dimension.</p>
      <p>I was with a lot of Liverpool fans who also wondered if Henderson should even be in the team, let alone be captain.</p>
      <p>But the pair haven’t just answered the questions about them, they have become intrinsic parts of the team and the dressing-room.</p>

      <p>Any team that has lots of mercurial characters and youngsters needs a glue to bind it together and those two have done that and then some for Liverpool.</p>
      <p>And if - if - Liverpool do end up being crowned champions this season there is no doubt that they will have been two of the most important drivers of that.</p>
      <p>Henderson, in particular, given the way he has grown into the captaincy.</p>
      <p>Finding a new leader after Steven Gerrard was always going to be difficult, but Henderson has stepped up brilliantly.</p>
