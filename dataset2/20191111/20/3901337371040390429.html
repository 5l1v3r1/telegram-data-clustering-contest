      <h1>Mosimane’s Plight – ‘Four Provinces In Five Days’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T20:39:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 20:39</time> by <a rel="author">Soccer Laduma</a></address>
      <p>Their busy schedule is taking a toll on Mamelodi Sundowns, but coach Pitso Mosimane says the Fifa break is timeous. </p>
      <p>Following their 3-2 defeat to Golden Arrows on Sunday afternoon in what was only their second defeat of the Absa Premiership campaign, Mosimane revealed that part of the reason why he was forced to make changes to his line-up was due to their congested fixture list – one he insisted they are coping with.  </p>

      <p><b>“</b>We didn’t have Denis (Onyango), the last two games and we didn’t have Themba Zwane and Gaston Sirino in the last two games. But injuries are part of the game. We are going through the process – four provinces in the last five days. But that is the roll of the dice and that is how the programme is,” Mosimane told reporters.</p>
      <p>“We were in PE, then Gauteng, then Polokwane and in Durban. All these things are happening within two days or three days that is why we have injuries and we had to refresh the team – by keeping (Tiyani) Mabunda, (Hlompho) Kekana and (Lebo) Maboe out. We need to freshen up the team. We have to soldier on and keep our players ready for the bigger programme that’s coming. The Fifa break will give us time to get Sirino and Zwane back and we will be full force. We will try more.”</p>
      <p>Downs will return back to action on November 23 against the same Arrows side, this time in the semifinals of the Telkom Knockout.</p>
