      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T20:21:56+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 20:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/chmiller44/" target="_blank">Chance Miller</a></address>
      <p>Following the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/06/apple-tv-plus-tv-shows-movies-guide/">debut of Apple TV+</a> at the beginning of the month, <i><a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/kim-rozenfeld-steps-down-apple-head-of-current-programming-unscripted-segues-first-look-deal-matt-cherniss-molly-thompson-1202782974/">Deadline</a></i> reports that Apple’s head of current scripted programming and unscripted content is leaving his role. The report says that Kim Rozenfeld is leaving his executive role, and shifting back towards a creative role.</p>
      <p>Rozenfeld was an early hire for Apple TV+, joining shortly after Zack Van Amburg and Jamie Erlicht in 2017. Before joining Apple, Rozenfeld served as head of current programming at Sony TV.</p>
      <p>Matt Cherniss, who serves as the head of scripted development for Apple TV+, will take over Rozenfeld’s responsibilities and now oversee current scripted series. Molly Thompson, head of documentaries for TV+, will continue to oversee “documentary film and series programming, development and current.”</p>
      <p>Even though he’s leaving his position at Apple TV+, Rozenfeld isn’t going far. He plans to return to his producing role through his company Half Full Productions, and he has already signed a first-look deal with Apple.</p>
      <p>Rozenfeld has experience in production:</p>
      <blockquote>Before joining Sony TV as EVP Current Programming in 2011, Rozenfeld was a scripted series producer based at ABC Studios, executive producing the ABC Family series <i>Huge.</i> He previously was a 20th TV-based producer who produced and directed the sitcom <i>Two Guys and a Girl.</i></blockquote>
