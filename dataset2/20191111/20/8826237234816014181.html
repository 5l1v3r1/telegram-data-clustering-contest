      <h1>That Tiny Black Dot on the Sun Today? It Was Mercury, in a Rare Celestial Crossing</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T20:58:40+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 20:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://time.com/author/associated-press/" target="_blank">MARCIA DUNN / AP</a></address>
      <p>(CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.) — Mini <a href="https://time.com/2958731/mercury-peculiar-solar-system/">Mercury</a> skipped across the vast, glaring face of the sun Monday in a rare celestial transit. Stargazers used solar-filtered binoculars and telescopes to spot Mercury — a tiny black dot — as it passed directly between Earth and the sun on Monday.</p>
      <p>The eastern U.S. and Canada got the whole 5 ½-hour show, weather permitting, along with Central and South America. The rest of the world, except for Asia and Australia, got just a sampling.</p>
      <p>Mercury is the solar system’s smallest, innermost planet. The next transit isn’t until 2032, and North America won’t get another shot until 2049.</p>

      <p>In Maryland, clouds prevented NASA solar astrophysicist Alex Young from getting a clear peek. Live coverage was provided by observatories including NASA’s orbiting Solar Dynamics Observatory.</p>
      <p>“It’s a bummer, but the whole event was still great,” Young wrote in an email. “Both getting to see it from space and sharing it with people all over the country and world.”</p>
      <p>At Cape Canaveral, space buffs got a two-for-one. As Mercury’s silhouette graced the morning sun, SpaceX launched 60 small satellites for global internet service, part of the company’s growing Starlink constellation in orbit.</p>
