      <p>A new and free cybersecurity training and certification program called Second Watch has been launched today by Palo Alto Networks to help U.S. veterans find new careers in cybersecurity after their military service is over.</p>
      <p>This new initiative is designed to provide military veterans with all the online resources needed to aid them to switch to new careers in cybersecurity, a mission that perfectly matches their previous training on effectively responding to threats and preventing attacks.</p>
      <p>"Second Watch is designed to be accessible to veterans at any level of technical expertise," said Palo Alto Networks VP and retired U.S. Army major general John Davis.</p>
      <p>"The initiative includes the opportunity to earn certification as a Palo Alto Networks Certified Cybersecurity Associate (PCCSA), a Palo Alto Networks Certified Network Security Administrator (PCNSA) or a Palo Alto Networks Certified Network Security Engineer (PCNSE)."</p>

      <p>The free digital learning courses provided by the company through the <a href="https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/Second-Watch/ct-p/Veterans_Network">Second Watch initiative</a> enable veterans to acquire cybersecurity knowledge on various topics ranging from "the basics of malware to managing a global infrastructure of Next-Gen Firewalls."</p>
      <p>Veterans will also be able to get certified while enrolled in Palo Alto Networks' training initiative, with the skills they demonstrate during the certification process allowing them to find a position in the cybersecurity industry after finishing the program.</p>
      <p>The program's <a href="https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/Second-Watch-Articles/Veteran-Skills-Learning-Path/ta-p/259466">Skills Learning Path</a> features nine self-paced steps that will guide them through the free digital learning courses available that can be accessed on an online portal.</p>
      <p>They will also be able to take the Palo Alto Networks Certified Network Security Administrator (PCNSA) and Palo Alto Networks Certified Cybersecurity Associate (PCCSA) <a href="https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/Certification/ct-p/Certification_Education">free exams along the way</a>, as well as take free courses to prepare for the paid for the <a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/services/education/certification#pcnse">Palo Alto Networks Certified Security Engineer (PCNSE)</a> exam.</p>

      <p>Palo Alto Networks also partnered with VetsinTech and CyberVetsUSA in the past to provide cybersecurity training to U.S. military veterans for a limited number of individuals.</p>
      <p>This time, however, with the help of the Second Watch initiative, the security outfit will be able to offer training and certification to a lot more veterans, from any military background, and on a much wider scale.</p>
      <p>"Veterans have completed a vital first watch in their military careers. With Second Watch, we want to help them train to protect our digital way of life," Davis <a href="https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2019/11/policy-second-watch/">concluded</a>.</p>
      <p>Free job hunting guidance and best practices resources, as well as detailed information on the Second Watch veterans program, is available on the initiative's <a href="https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/Second-Watch-Articles/Questions-and-Answers/ta-p/259456">frequently asked questions page</a>.</p>
