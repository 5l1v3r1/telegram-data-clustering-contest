      <p>Cape Town - South Africa's <b>Mpumelelo Mhlongo</b> has broken his own world record in the 100m (T44 catergory) at the <b>2019 World Para Athletics Championships</b> in Dubai.</p>
      <p>Racing in the T64 event, Mhlongo earned a silver medal by coming home in second behind German Johannes Floors. </p>
      <p>Mhlongo's time of 11.09 bettered his own previous world record in the T44 catergory, however.</p>
      <p>Mhlongo was born with amniotic band syndrome which resulted in a right leg shorter than his left as well as a club foot. Although doctors told his mother he would never walk, he took his first tentative steps at the age of six. </p>
      <p>While Mhlongo excels in both the 100m and 200m events, he also takes part in the long and high jump. </p>
      <p>Earlier, Sheryl James claimed bronze in the T37 400m event while on Sunday Anrune Weyers claimed Team South Africa's first gold of the championship when she crossed the line first in the T47 400m race.</p>
