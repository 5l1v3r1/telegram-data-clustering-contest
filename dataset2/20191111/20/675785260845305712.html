      <p>Authorities in the US have arrested a man accused of trying to lure a three-year-old girl into his van with the offer of a puppy.</p>
      <p>The girl's mother told police a man in a silver van asked her for a cigarette in a Pennsylvanian parking lot.</p>
      <p>She told officers she gave him a cigarette, then he asked her daughter if she wanted to see a puppy in the back of his van.</p>
      <p>But the mum said there was no dog inside the vehicle, according to the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/11/creep-tried-to-lure-3-year-old-girl-into-van-with-puppy-cops/">New York Post</a> .</p>
      <p>She told police she had been with her husband and two daughters when the stranger approached them in the parking lot in York County, West Manchester Township.</p>
      <p>She drove to another store and called police after the encounter.</p>

      <p>Police told US media they found New York man Sixtus Chiemeka Udeke in the van, which had temporary New Jersey license plates, along with two other men.</p>
      <p>Police arrested Udeke, 39, on Friday and pressed charges relating to luring a child into a motor vehicle.</p>
      <p>The force said Udeke, also known as Azubuike Nuubisi Anodu, is in custody in the York County Prison.</p>
      <p>He has been denied bail and is due in court later this month.</p>
