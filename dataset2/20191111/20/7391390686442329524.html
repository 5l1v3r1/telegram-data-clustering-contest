      <h1>When Does 'The Mandalorian' Take Place? The Disney+ Series Fills In Some Narrative Gaps</h1>

      <p>With so many <i>Star Wars</i> movies and TV shows being released simultaneously, it can be difficult to keep the timeline straight. And now that Disney+ is releasing <i>The Mandalorian</i> on Tuesday, Nov. 12, the chronology has become even more complex. Fortunately, it's not too hard to parse <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/everything-we-know-about-the-mandalorian">when <i>The Mandalorian</i> takes place</a> — five years after <i>The Return of the Jedi</i>, per the official<i> Star Wars</i> site, and 25 years before the events of <i>Episode VII: The Force Awakens</i>. As such, the Disney+ series also occurs before the First Order took power — the dictatorship founded by Supreme Leader Snoke in<i> Episode VII: The Force Awakens.</i></p>
      <p>"If you look throughout history, it's fun at first, but it gets very complicated very quickly. The idea of that world after <i><i>The Return of the Jedi</i></i> and what would happen and what sort of characters would survive, and what it was like until <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/star-wars-new-mandalorian-details-footage-unveiled-1201931">the new Republic took over</a>," showrunner Jon Favreau said at Chicago's <i>Star Wars </i>Celebration, per the <i>Hollywood Reporter</i>. "You have vestiges of the Empire. You have only the strong surviving. You have chaos taking over the galaxy."</p>
      <p>In other words, parsing the complex <i>Star Wars</i> timelines can get confusing fast. For that reason, here's a handy primer to what has happened involving the Mandalorians before the Disney+ series takes place.</p>
      <h3>Mandalore Is Defeated, Then Freed</h3>
      <p>Voca Productions on YouTube</p>
      <p>The animated series <i>Star Wars: The Clone Wars </i>depicts Duchess Satine Kryze declaring that the <a href="https://www.starwars.com/databank/mandalore">Mandalorians would remain neutral</a> during the Clone War, per the official <i>Star Wars</i> site. Darth Maul consequently takes over the planet of Mandalore with the help of a rebel Mandalorian group known as the Death Watch.</p>
      <p>Satine is then executed, but her sister, Bo-Katan, refuses to concede to Darth Maul. Eventually, she and a Mandalorian named Sabine Wren, who wields Darksaber, overthrow the Empire, returning to their people's roots as warriors.</p>
      <h3>Episode II: Attack of the Clones — Jango Fett Is Introduced</h3>

      <p>Audiences meet a Mandalorian and <a href="https://www.starwars.com/databank/jango-fett">bounty hunter named Jango Fett</a> on the planet of Kamino in <i>Episode II: Attack of the Clones.</i> He is also the father of Boba Fett, whom audiences would have already seen in the original trilogy. Except Boba's not so much Jango's <i>son </i>as his <i>genetic clone</i>, but whatever the case, he's raised Boba as his own.</p>
      <p>Later in the same film, the mercenary is killed by Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson), and a young Boba swears to avenge his father's death. Audiences learn more about the young bounty hunter's education in the aforementioned <i>Clone Wars</i> series, but he doesn't return to the films until <i>Episode IV.</i></p>
      <h3>Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back — Boba Fett Takes The Stage</h3>

      <p>Although <a href="https://www.starwars.com/databank/boba-fett">Boba Fett appears briefly in <i>Episode IV: A New Hope</i></a><i> </i>as one of Jabba the Hutt's mercenaries, he has a meatier role in <i>Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back</i>. In this installment, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZCdje_TOg_M?t=97">Darth Vader hires the bounty hunter</a> to capture the <i>Millennium Falcon </i>and its inhabitants. Later, a frozen-in-carbonite Han Solo is given to Boba, who then loads him onto his ship, <i>Slave I,</i> in order to sell him to Jabba.</p>
      <h3>Episode VI: The Return of the Jedi — Boba Fett Dies</h3>
      <p>Voca Productions on YouTube</p>
      <p>In the final movie in the trilogy, Boba falls into the Sarlacc Pit while fighting Han and Luke Skywalker. He's assumed dead, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/68pag1/is_boba_fett_dead_or_alive/">some fans are still holding out hope.</a></p>
      <h3>Episode VI: The Return of the Jedi — The Empire Falls</h3>
      <p>MrFreezy on YouTube</p>
      <p>As for the rest of the film, Luke is finally able to defeat his father, Darth Vader, and Emperor Palpatine by extension, thus ending the reign of the Empire.</p>
      <h3>'The Mandalorian' Takes Place</h3>
      <p>Star Wars on YouTube</p>
      <p>Fans don't know very much about this new series protagonist — he is wearing armor, after all — but that's all part of his mystique. "The Mandalorian is a mysterious, lone gunfighter in the outer reaches of the galaxy," star Pedro Pascal said of his character at the same <i>Star Wars </i>Celebration. "Some might say he has questionable moral character, which is in line with some of our best westerns, some good samurai. All the good stuff. He's a badass."</p>
      <p>However, while previous <i>Star Wars</i> properties had a very clear line between good and evil, The Mandalorian blurs the moral boundary. "This <a href="https://ew.com/tv/2019/09/04/the-mandalorian-first-order/">doesn't turn into a good guy universe</a> because you blew up two Death Stars," <i>Mandalorian</i> director Dave Filoni told <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>, referring to the planet-sized weapons destroyed in <i>Episode IV: A New Hope</i> and in <i>Episode VI: The Return of the Jedi.</i> "You get that the Rebels won and they're trying to establish a Republic, but there's no way that could have set in for everybody all at once."</p>
      <p>But while the Disney+ series takes place after the Empire's been defeated, audiences already know that a new villain will arrive in the next 25 years. At the moment, however, the Galaxy is a bit like the wild west, with every man (or Mandalorian, as it were) to himself.</p>
