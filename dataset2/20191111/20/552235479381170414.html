      <p>WWE star Drew McIntyre has been proudly wearing his <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> shirt ahead of tonight's show in Glasgow.</p>
      <p>The wrestler is a die-hard Light Blues supporter and took the opportunity to send a message to the Ibrox faithful before he gets in the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/wwe">WWE</a> ring at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/the-hydro">The Hydro</a> this evening.</p>
      <p>McIntyre was pictured wearing the home shirt with Rangers legend Ally McCoist on the back of it.</p>
      <p>He said: "This is Drew McIntyre here and I'm not just at any show, I am home. I am in Scotland, there are thousand of Scots ready to get crazy tonight.</p>
      <p>"You might have noticed I am wearing my Rangers jersey, I am a Rangers fan I think everybody knows that. More importantly I am a Scottish football fan.</p>
      <p>"Rangers and my career over the past few years have been very similar. I got fired, Rangers relegated to the bottom.</p>
      <p>"Both wouldn't give up, the fans wouldn't give up, my fans stood behind me the whole time.</p>
      <p>"We both fought fought fought and now we are both back on top.</p>
      <p>"Rangers and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> are being talked about the world, Scottish football is being talked about in the world.</p>
      <p>"I am a happy man, I am on top of the moon. I am going to go out there and I am going to get mental. And if I see you down the line, get ready to get mental with me."</p>
