      <h2>Lisa Fowler confronted her friend Mel Owen over her increasingly disturbing behaviour on EastEnders - but was left stunned over her reaction</h2>

      <p>EastEnders viewers were left utterly horrified tonight over Mel Owen's comment to Lisa Fowler tonight.</p>
      <p>Over the last week, Lisa has become increasingly disturbed by Mel's unhinged behaviour - which even resulted in her friend punching her.</p>
      <p>Despite that, Lisa tried once again to get her friend to seek help, even booking her in for an appointment with her doctor.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, this had the opposite desired effect as Mel was left utterly furious.</p>
      <p>Trapping Lisa in the club, office Mel asked her: "You know what you are, Lis?"</p>

      <p>"Yes," Lisa nodded enthusiastically. "Your best friend."</p>
      <p>"Some of the time," Mel agreed. "But most of the time you're just something we have to put up with. And we've had to do a lot of that, me and Louise, over the years."</p>
      <p>Mel continued spitefully: "With you in and out of psychiatric wards... and i thought, one day, the doctors are gonna call us up and tell us you finally done it. Finally put yourself out of your misery."</p>
      <p>Lisa struggled not to cry, saying that she could forgive a lot, but Mel interrupted her.</p>

      <p>"I can't," Mel said. "I can forgive you being weak and I can forgive you acting stupid.</p>
      <p>"I can forgive you not being able to cope as a mother and me step in, do it all for you. But what I can't forgive is you sticking your weak, stupid and foolish little nose into my business."</p>
      <p>As Lisa remained silent, Mel said: "Now, Louise is moving to Portugal because of me, what I can offer her. Because of the life that I can give her. And you're the price we have to pay.</p>
      <p>"But if you push it too far, it's like any deal - it collapses. We go and leave you behind."</p>
