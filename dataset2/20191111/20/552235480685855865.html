      <p>Two tiny kittens have been found dumped in a skip in Livingston.</p>
      <p>Shocking images of the six-week-old kittens huddled together in freezing conditions were shared by the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/stray-cat-found-close-death-20859228">Cat</a> Protection West Lothian on Saturday.</p>
      <p>While one of the cats is doing okay, the other is believed to be fighting for its life.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/brave-baby-boy-inspires-donors-20855883">charity</a> shared photos of the abandoned animals on their official Facebook page.</p>
      <p>The post read: "These two six-week-old kittens were retrieved from inside a box which was put into a skip in Livingston. </p>
      <p>"They must have spent last night, remember is was minus two degrees, in this box in the skip.</p>
      <p>"Wed got them to our vet this morning, they spent the day in an oxygen tent with a heat pad.</p>
      <p>"The wee ginger kitten is okay but it's touch and go for the other one."</p>

      <p>Volunteers are urging anyone with information about the mother to come forward.</p>
      <p>The post continued: "Our real concern now is for the mum cat, she will not be neutered.</p>
      <p>"If anyone knows anything we will pay for the mum cat to be neutered, no questions asked, nothing.</p>
      <p>"Please, please, please just call.</p>
      <p>"We won't ask your name.</p>
      <p>"Just please let us pay to get the mum neutered and there will be no more unwanted kittens put in a box and into a skip."</p>
      <p>The photos sparked outcry on social media.</p>
      <p>Frank Love commented: "Why in God's name did they just dump the poor things to die?</p>
      <p>"Surely they are aware of organisations like Cats Protection and SSPCA who would do their utmost to help re-home them.</p>
      <p>"Even leaving them in a place where they would be easily found would have been preferable to a skip.</p>
      <p>"Totally heartless."</p>

      <p>Julie Reid added: "Why can people not just call you and admit they can't look after them?</p>
      <p>"Instead they dump them in the most horrible situation.</p>
      <p>"We all have struggles in life but doesn't mean we have to be cruel.</p>
      <p>"That's why amazing organisations like the cat protection is here."</p>
