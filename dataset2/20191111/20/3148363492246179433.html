      <h1>Ocasio-Cortez Dismisses Fears Democrat Party Moving Too Far Left</h1>
      <h2>Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) dismissed the mounting concerns from establishment Democrats, who fear that she and presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) are moving the Democrat Party “too far left,” asserting that the ultra-leftist movement is “bringing the party home.”</h2>

      <p>Ocasio-Cortez stumped with Sanders in Iowa over the weekend and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/10/us/politics/bernie-sanders-aoc-iowa.html">addressed</a> critics who say that candidates like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Sanders are moving the Democrat Party “too far left” with their proposals for “free” college, Medicare for All, and multitrillion-dollar climate change proposals.</p>
      <p>“When people try to accuse us of going too far left — we’re not pushing the party left,” Ocasio-Cortez told the crowd in Coralville, Iowa. “We are bringing the party home.”</p>
      <p>“Are you all ready for a revolution?” she continued, using the same rhetoric Sanders has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/03/bernie-sanders-political-revolution-billionaire-democratic-2016-race">touting</a> for years. “I sure am.”</p>
      <p>Ocasio-Cortez’s remark follows <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/08/hillary-clinton-establishment-democrats-signal-deepening-panic-over-democrat-field/">rumblings</a> of internal panic among establishment Democrats, prompting some – like Michael Bloomberg, Hillary Clinton, and Eric Holder – to consider jumping in the race in a last-ditch effort to revive the Democrat field.</p>
      <p>While former Vice President Joe Biden (D) has attempted to present himself as a more “moderate” candidate, the spotlight on his role in his son’s business dealings in both China and Ukraine and his <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/10/joe-biden-no-one-needs-magazine-100-clips-it/">mounting</a> gaffes have some questioning his viability and stamina. Meanwhile, Warren has put a significant dent in his support, even surpassing him in select national and early primary state polls.</p>
      <p>Sanders, following his endorsements from three members of the “Squad,” has experienced a second wind and continues to maintain a presence in the top tier of candidates. Both candidates have put forth more radical, socialist proposals – proposals that some doubt will bode well for the Democrat Party in a general election matchup.</p>
      <p>A recent poll conducted by YouGov for the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation found that support for socialism in the United States is falling overall, “dropping from 42% favorability in the 2018 poll to 36% favorability this year,” as Breitbart News <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2019/10/28/poll-millennials-socialism/">reported</a>.</p>
