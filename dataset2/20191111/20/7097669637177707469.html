      <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Monday condemned "unjustified use of deadly force" in the latest Hong Kong violence and urged police and civilians alike to de-escalate the situation, a senior Trump administration official said.</p>
      <p>The U.S. statement came after Hong Kong police shot and critically wounded a protester and a man was set on fire in violence that prompted leader Carrie Lam to denounce "enemies of the people."</p>
      <p>"Hong Kong police and civilians alike have a responsibility to de-escalate and avoid violent confrontations," the U.S. administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity, after a weekend of stepped-up clashes in pro-democracy protests across the Chinese-ruled territory, a former British colony.</p>
