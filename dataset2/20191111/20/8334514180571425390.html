      <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Monday urged Bolivia’s legislative assembly to meet “sooner rather than later” to formally accept the resignation of President Evo Morales and begin a civilian-led transition to fill the country’s political vacuum.</p>
      <p>A senior U.S. State Department official also said Washington does not consider Morales’ departure to be a coup, as Morales himself and the Mexican government have alleged. It was instead the result of protests that showed the Bolivian people “have had enough of a government ignoring the will of its voters,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.</p>
