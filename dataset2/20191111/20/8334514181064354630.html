      <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Organization of American States plans to hold a special meeting on the situation in Bolivia at its Washington headquarters on Tuesday, the OAS said on Monday after the resignation of Bolivian President Evo Morales.</p>
      <p>The session is set for 3 p.m. EST (2000 GMT) and has been called at the request of the United States, Venezuela, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Guatemala, Peru and the Dominican Republic, the OAS said.</p>
      <p>While the United States has expressed support for Morales’ resignation, which he announced on Sunday, Venezuela has joined with some of his leftist allies decrying the turn of events as a “coup.”</p>
