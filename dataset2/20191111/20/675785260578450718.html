      <h1>Gary Neville's message to Arsenal fans who want Unai Emery axed</h1>
      <h2>The Spanish boss has been told by club chiefs that Arsenal must improve following a recent run of poor results that have put him under pressure to keep his job</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T20:54:40+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 20:54</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/gary-neville">Gary Neville</a> has told Arsenal fans they must be patient with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/unai-emery">Unai Emery</a> amid speculation surrounding the Gunners' manager's future.</p>
      <p>The Spanish boss is under increasing pressure at the Emirates after a run of just six wins in their previous 19 league matches.</p>
      <p>Arsenal's defeat to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> on Saturday leaves them eight points adrift of a top four spot after 12 games.</p>
      <p>Emery has been backed by Gunners chiefs <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenal-chiefs-release-statement-over-20861422">in a statement released on Monday</a> , and Neville feels he needs time to turn things round.</p>
      <p>"For <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> , the fans are getting very impatient at this moment of time," Neville said on the Gary Neville Podcast. "I don’t think anybody was surprised that Leicester won that game. It doesn’t shock you, does it? It doesn’t surprise you with Arsenal.</p>

      <p>"They are what they are. They’re a frustration. Emery is being put under big pressure. I know that Emery is a great coach and following on from Arsene Wenger was never going to be easy.</p>
      <p>"Great coaches will come into Arsenal and struggle to change things there. We’ve seen that at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> when Sir Alex Ferguson left.</p>
      <p>"Ferguson and Wenger were the leaders at those clubs. It’s going to take time and there needs to be patience shown at Arsenal.</p>

      <p>"Manchester United and Arsenal are both big clubs, huge clubs, and they will get back, the cycle will turn."</p>
      <p>Arsenal's head of football Raul Sanllehi and managing director Vinai Venkatesham met staff at a pre-planned get together for 200 staff and underlined their backing for Emery, although it came with a warning.</p>
      <p>They told staff: “We are as disappointed as everyone else with both our results and performances at this stage of the season. We share the frustration with our fans, Unai, players and all our staff as they are not at the level we want or expect.</p>
      <p>“Things need to improve to meet our objectives for the season, and we firmly believe Unai is the right man for the job, together with the backroom team we have in place. We are all working intensively behind the scenes to turn things around and are confident we will.</p>
      <p>“We never take our fantastic support for granted. We hope we can all stick together and get behind the team in this challenging period, as together we are stronger.”</p>
