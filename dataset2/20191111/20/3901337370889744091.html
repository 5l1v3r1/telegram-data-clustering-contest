      <p>Spanish publication <i>Sport</i> recently reported that 18-year-old Real attacker Rodrygo, who scored a hat-trick in the UEFA Champions League last week, was very close to signing for Barcelona before he eventually joined Los Blancos.</p>
      <p>It was claimed the Catalan giants had even reached an agreement with the player, until Real president Florentino Perez intervened, turning the deal on its head by offering more money to both Santos and the young talent.</p>
      <p>Rodrygo joins a relatively long list of footballers who have chosen the famous white jersey over Barcelona's blue and garnet colours, including arguably the greatest player in Real's history – Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>

      <p>The Portuguese forward became the Madrid club's most expensive signing ever at the time of his arrival in 2009, but admitted to having an offer from rivals Blaugrana too. It has even been said that Sir Alex Ferguson would have preferred him to join the Blaugrana, but Ronaldo had already made his decision to fulfil his lifelong dream of playing for Los Blancos.</p>
      <p>German playmaker Mesut Ozil, who joined Real the following year, was also believed to have the option of joining Barca. The midfielder later revealed his decision was made based on the manner in which Jose Mourinho fought to sign him, something then Blaugrana boss Pep Guardiola reportedly did not do.</p>
      <p>Going further back, another big name who chose Real over the Catalan giants was Manchester United icon David Beckham, who made his move to Spain in 2003. The Englishman became part of a famous "Galacticos" team, but his career might have been very different had he gone the other way.</p>
