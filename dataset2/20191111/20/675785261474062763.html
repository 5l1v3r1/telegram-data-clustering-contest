      <p>Mike Bushell was left utterly stunned after seeing a side-by-side picture revealing his weight loss on Strictly's It Takes Two tonight.</p>
      <p>The BBC presenter, 53, became the seventh celebrity to leave the show at the weekend with professional partner Katya Jones.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Rylan Clark-Neal following their exit, Mike and Katya watched clips from their time on the show.</p>
      <p>Mike, who has lost around a stone and a half, joked that he couldn't recognise himself from the beginning of the show.</p>
      <p>Sharing a picture of him at the beginning of the show paired up with a snap of him doing his last dance, Katya was stunned over the transformation.</p>

      <p>The couple landed in the dance-off with Michelle Visage and Giovanni Pernice.</p>
      <p>After both pairs performed their dances a second time, all judges chose to save Michelle and Giovanni, citing them as the "clear winner".</p>
      <p>Despite that, Mike appeared to be happy and gushed about his "amazing" time on the show.</p>

      <p>He said: "I have had the most amazing 9 or 10 weeks since we started training. I have lost a stone and half. I’m a guy in his 50s, I’m mentally sharper, I feel able to deal with pressured situations – thanks to the dance-offs! It has changed me completely and honestly I’m not going to stop dancing.</p>
      <p>"My wife Emily has supported me all the way through and my daughters. My dad’s going to take up ballroom dancing and my mum has started Zumba – I want to thank all my family and the judges. I have all the comments framed around the house.</p>
      <p>"Every moment has been an absolute honour and a joy. I didn’t think I’d get this far so I have already booked a hotel in Blackpool, so I’m still coming along. This amazing teacher, Katya, I can’t tell you the dedication that she puts in. She’d make the greatest sporting coach ever, she makes you believe that anything is possible.”</p>
