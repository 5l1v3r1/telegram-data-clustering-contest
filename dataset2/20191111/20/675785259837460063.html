      <p>T.I.'s daughter Deyjah Harris has unfollowed her dad and family on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> after he made comments about her hymen.</p>
      <p>It comes after her rapper dad, 39, said he attends Deyjah's gynecologist appointments to make sure she's a virgin.</p>
      <p>The star, 18, has yet to publicly address her dad's remarks as he bragged that he has ensured her hymen is still intact by meeting with her doctor after her annual check-up.</p>
      <p>Deyjah recently liked a series of tweets calling his actions "disgusting", "possessive" and "controlling".</p>
      <p>Adding fuel to the fire, she also tweeted: "I loveeeeeee yalllllll" and received huge support from her fans.</p>
      <p>T.I. made the controversial comments while speaking on the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/life-hacks-with-t-i/id1468347586?i=1000455974705">Ladies Like Us</a> podcast and he stressed that it was very important to him that Deyjah has not had sex yet.</p>

      <p>He admitted he feels differently about 15 year old son King, who is sexually active.</p>
      <p>"I will say as of her 18th birthday," T.I. said, "Her hymen is still intact."</p>
      <p>He continued: "Deyjah's 18, just graduated high school now and she's attending her first year of college, figuring it out for herself.</p>
      <p>"And yes, not only have we had the conversation [about sex], we have yearly trips to the gynaecologist to check her hymen. "</p>

      <p>Describing one visit to the doctor's, he told hosts Nazanin Mandi and Nadia Moham: "So it's this one time we go, I think this might have been after her 16th birthday. This is what we do. Right after the birthday we celebrate.</p>
      <p>"Usually like the day after the party, she's enjoying her gifts. I put a sticky note on the door: 'Gyno. Tomorrow. 9:30."</p>
      <p>He continued: "So we'll go and sit down and the doctor will come and talk and the doctor's maintaining a high level of professionalism.</p>

      <p>"He's like, 'Well, you know sir, I have to, in order to share information' - I'm like, 'Deyjah, they want you to sign this...so we can share information. Is there anything you would not want me to know?'</p>
      <p>"'See doc?' 'No problem.'"</p>
      <p>After causing a stir, Planned Parenthood hit back at the rapper's lewd remarks on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> in a string of posts.</p>
      <p>T.I.'s rap lyrics frequently reference sex - including the song Hotel which describes hookups with a number of women.</p>
