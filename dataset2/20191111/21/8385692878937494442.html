      <p>Razer built this headset with comfort in-mind. The ear cups are super large and very thick. This gives you plenty of cushion for your ears so that they stay comfortable. Many larger headsets like this, will feel uncomfortable after an hour or two, because of how big they really are. So this is good to see.</p>
      <p>When it comes to sound, these are surprisingly really good. That's thanks to Razer putting 50mm drivers in each ear cup. So these will get plenty loud while also offering some deep bass as well as crystal clear mids and highs.</p>
      <p>This wouldn't be a gaming headset without a microphone. And this time around, it is retractable. So you can put it away when you don't want to use it in games. That is a really cool feature to have, honestly.</p>
