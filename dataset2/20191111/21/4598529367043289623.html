      <p>Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) has been spending an awful lot of time with President Donald Trump lately, sparking speculation that he’s angling for Mick Mulvaney’s acting chief of staff job.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/thats-what-he-wants-republicans-see-mark-meadows-angling-for-white-house-chief-of-staff">According to the Washington Examiner,</a> Meadows has recently traveled with Trump to New York and Kentucky, two trips to which he had no personal connection.</p>
      <p>Meadows has also really been putting his shoulder into delegitimizing the impeachment inquiry, delivering the bombastic cable news performances Trump so loves.</p>
      <p>Trump is also rumored to be souring on Mulvaney, ever since the acting chief of staff gave a less than satisfactory <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/mulvaney-claims-he-didnt-say-what-he-actually-said-on-ukraine">performance</a> at a press conference last month. Mulvaney has also been increasingly implicated in the Ukraine pressure campaign as more witnesses testify.</p>
