      <p>NEW DELHI: Sales of cars and SUVs broke an 11-month string of declines as numbers turned positive, although by a minuscule 0.3%, on festive spirits, deep discounts and new models.</p>
      <p>According to numbers released by Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam), the turn in sentiments may be sustained through November and December on lower base advantage.</p>
      <p>“There have been certain positives witnessed in the market. Apart from new models and attractive deals, these include relatively lower financing rates both for customers and dealers,” Rajan Wadhera, president of Siam, who is also the CEO for <a href="http://www.zigwheels.com/newcars/Mahindra">Mahindra</a> and Mahindra’s automotive business, told TOI.</p>
      <p>Sales of passenger vehicles, a mix of cars, SUVs and vans, stood at 2.85 lakh against 2.84 lakh units sold in the same month last year. While Siam brings out wholesale numbers that the companies dispatch to dealers, company officials say that healthy retail sales in the month (customer purchases) led to lowering of inventory levels.</p>

      <p>Wadhera said recent steps initiated by the government, including those related to the revival of economy, will also aid a comeback. He said demand for models from new entrants such as <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kia-Motors">Kia Motors</a> and MG Motors also helped in keeping October numbers positive. While Kia sold nearly 13,000 units of Seltos SUV in October, MG Motors sold over 3,500 units of Hector off-roader.</p>
      <p>However, demand generation continues to remain tough in categories such as commercial vehicles and two-wheelers.</p>
      <p>Two-wheeler sales in October declined 14% to 17.6 lakh units compared to 20.5 lakh units in the year-ago month. Motorcycle sales declined by 16% to 11.2 lakh units as against 13.3 lakh units a year earlier. “Two-wheelers largely cater to mobility requirements in the rural area. In the past few months, there have been various disruptions like floods and excessive rainfall in several regions.</p>
      <p>However, we expect things to change for better starting this month," Wadhera said. Scooter sales last month declined by 10% to 5.8 lakh units as against 6.4 lakh units in the year-ago period. Commercial vehicle sales were down 23% at 66,773 units in October, Siam said.</p>
