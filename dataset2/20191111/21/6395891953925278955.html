      <p><b>LONDONÂ (AP)</b> - Defending champion Alexander Zverev pulled off another big win at the ATP Finals, beating top-ranked Rafael Nadal 6-2, 6-4 Monday for his first career victory over the Spaniard.</p>
      <p>Nadal had a 5-0 record against Zverev but had an uncharacteristically mistake-filled performance at the O2 Arena.</p>
      <p>In his first match since pulling out of the Paris Masters semifinals with an abdominal injury just nine days ago, Nadal dropped his serve three straight times, didn't force a single break point, and his normally powerful forehand was responsible for more than four times as many unforced errors (13) as winners (3).</p>
      <p>The whole thing was over in just 83 minutes and means Zverev has beaten each of tennis' Big Three in his last three matches at the O2.</p>
      <p>The German defeated six-time champion Roger Federer in last year's semifinals and then five-time winner Novak Djokovic in the final.</p>
      <p>Nadal has a history of being far from his best at the ATP Finals, which comes at the end of a gruelling season that often takes its toll on the Spaniard because of his ultra-physical playing style. He has qualified for the event for 15 years in a row but has pulled out of it on six occasions because of injuries. He has never won the title, reaching the final twice.</p>
      <p>This year he hasn't finished a tournament since winning the U.S. Open in August, also pulling out of Shanghai because of a hand injury. But he showed up to London hoping to stave off Djokovic for the year-end No. 1 ranking.</p>
      <p>Djokovic won his opening match on Sunday and this loss cuts Nadal's lead over the Serb to just 440 points in the rankings table - each round-robin win is worth 200 points - with a total of 1,300 more points up for grabs for each player.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Stefanos Tsitsipas earned his first career win over Daniil Medvedev - a victory that clearly meant a lot to the Greek.</p>
      <p>Not only because Tsitsipas was also 0-5 against the Russian before winning 7-6 (5), 6-4, or even that it came in his ATP Finals debut.</p>
      <p>But mainly because two of the biggest rising stars in tennis simply don't like each other that much.</p>
      <p>"It's a victory that I craved for a long time now, and it's great that it came at this moment," Tsitsipas said. "Our chemistry definitely isn't the best that you can find on the tour. It's not that I hate him (but) we will not go to dinner together."</p>
      <p>The grudge dates to their first meeting, in Miami last year, when Medvedev berated Tsitsipas for not apologizing after hitting a net cord during a point, a spat that ended with both players trading insults on court.</p>
      <p>"After that, I think I didn't win a single game. He did get into my head, and I was very frustrated that it did go this way," Tsitsipas said. "He started telling me that I should apologize, that what I do is unsportsmanlike. . Somehow it did affect me. I did get (angry) and said what I said, which I do regret, but at the time I was very frustrated."</p>
      <p>Since that match, Medvedev had earned another four straight wins over Tsitsipas, including in the Shanghai semifinals in October.</p>
      <p>But on Monday, the sixth-seeded Greek earned the only break of the match to take a 5-4 lead in the second set and clinched the win with a forehand overhead at the net.</p>
      <p>"He was better today, but I felt like I was missing some things," Medvedev said. "This frustrates me after. I do think it would frustrate me against any other opponent. I hate to lose against anybody. Of course I wanted to make it even more bigger head-to-head, but it's the way it is."</p>
      <p>Both players are making their debut at the year-end tournament for the world's top eight players, which features a round robin before the semifinals. Medvedev established himself as one of the best hard-court players on tour this season, reaching the U.S. Open final and winning four titles on the surface.</p>
      <p>But Tsitispas - the first Greek player to qualify for the ATP Finals - used an aggressive forehand to keep the Russian from dictating the match, coming to the net 26 times and winning 22 of those points.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, Federer faces Matteo Berrettini and Djokovic takes on Dominic Thiem.</p>
