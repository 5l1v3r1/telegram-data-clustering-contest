      <p>A new update to the YouTube Terms of Service has users concerned that Google will cancel their account if they are deemed to be not "commercially viable". Google says this is not true and that this section of the agreement only applies towards Google services and not user accounts.</p>
      <p>On November 10th, 2019, Google released an updated YouTube Terms of Use in order to make it easier to read and to make sure they are up to date.</p>
      <p>"We made some changes to our Terms of Service in order to make them easier to read and to ensure they’re up to date. We’re not changing the way our products work, how we collect or process data, or any of your settings," a YouTube spokesperson told BleepingComputer.com.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, a part of the "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/t/terms?preview=20191210#ae7e8c059d">Account Suspension &amp; Termination</a>" section of the updated Terms of Use is not clearly written and states that Google can terminate your access or your Google account's access to YouTube if it is not "commercially viable".</p>
      <p>
        <b>Terminations by YouTube for Service Changes</b>
      </p>
      <p>YouTube may terminate your access, or your Google account’s access to all or part of the Service if YouTube believes, in its sole discretion, that provision of the Service to you is no longer commercially viable.</p>
      <p>This confusing statement and its poor location in the Terms of Use has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/du95s3/ysk_that_youtube_is_updating_their_terms_of/">led people to believe</a> that Google can terminate their access if they are using ad blockers, which remove some of Google's ad revenue, or their YouTube account/channel if it does not generate adequate ad revenue.</p>
      <p>After reaching out to Google about these concerns, BleepingComputer was told that the language regarding "commercial viability" was always present in the Terms of Use and has not been updated.</p>
      <p>They further told us that this language has nothing to do with "how our products work or how we work with creators, nor their rights over their works, or their right to monetize."</p>
      <p>Instead, this clause refers to Google's right to remove particular YouTube or Google services if they find that is does not commercially make sense to keep supporting them.</p>
      <p>This is further clarified in a tweet by YouTube's Twitter account that stated that this language is about terminating "outdated" or "low usage" Google services, not about user accounts.</p>
      <p>To clarify, the "commercially viable" section is not about terminating an account bc it’s not making money / not in YPP. It’s about discontinuing certain features or parts of the service bc they are outdated or have low usage. This does not impact creators or viewers in new ways.</p>

      <p>While Google's goal was to make their Terms of Use easier to read and understand, the fact that this language is under the "Account Suspension &amp; Termination" makes it easy to understand why users would think it applies to them.</p>
      <p>It may make more sense to put this language in a different section so that users are not confused again the future.</p>
