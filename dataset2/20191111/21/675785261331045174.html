      <p>The quake struck the Ardèche region and did not cause any major damage, the French Central Seismological Office (BCSF) in Strasbourg said in a statement, according to <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2019/11/11/four-injured-as-unusually-strong-earthquake-hits-france">Euronews</a> .</p>
      <p>The tremor was felt mainly in the Drôme and Ardèche regions and pictures show quake damage to some buildings in the eastern city of Le Teil.</p>
      <p>Early reports suggest it is the strongest quake to hit mainland France since 2003, according to French media.</p>

      <p>It was reported to have been felt most intensely around Montélimar where a person was seriously injured by falling scaffolding.</p>
      <p>Three other people were slightly injured in the Ardèche region "following a panic attack", the Drôme prefecture said on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a>. </p>

      <p>According to the French Seismological Central Bureau, it was the strongest quake to hit mainland France in a magnitude 5.4 jolt struck in 2003 in the Vosges region.</p>
      <p>The French news site reported that the quake's epicentre was a little over 10km from the Cruas nuclear power plant in Ardèche and about 30km from the site of the Tricastin power plant, and another, Orano, which processes nuclear fuel.</p>
      <p>Authorities shut down all three reactors in order to carry out preventative checks.</p>
      <p>However they did not show any immediate signs of damage, according to a statement from the operator, EDF.</p>
      <p>The Nuclear Safety Authority confirmed that the earthquake had caused "no apparent damage" to the reactors, but requested that EDF to continue examining them before restarting them.</p>
