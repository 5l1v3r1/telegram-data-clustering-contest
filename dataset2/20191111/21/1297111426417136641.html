      <h1>Respect, recollections and reverence mark Remembrance Day in Regina's Victoria Park</h1>
      <h2>While stationed in England preparing for D-Day, David Welder's grandfather developed asthma — something he would regret until his dying day.</h2>

      <p>While stationed in England preparing for D-Day, David Welder’s grandfather developed asthma.</p>
      <p>The condition, which can make breathing difficult and trigger coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath, meant he wasn’t allowed to go with his team to tackle one of the largest amphibious military assaults in history.</p>
      <p>“He regretted it up until the day he passed away,” said Welder. “A lot of his friends (from) his gunning division actually were killed in WWII and he wished that he could have been there with them for the last days.”</p>

      <p>Welder’s other grandfather received the Italy and Germany Star medals and others for his work as a transport driver, also during the Second World War.</p>
      <p>Both his grandfathers have since passed away, but the tradition of military service lives on in Welder, who served in the Princess Patricia Canadian Light Infantry until an injury forced his release, and his brother who is currently a combat engineer.</p>
      <p>“It was fun,” said Welder from the Remembrance Day ceremony held Monday at the cenotaph in Victoria Park. “I wouldn’t change it for the world. Remembrance Day (means) a lot to me. It’s not because I served so much, but (because of) everyone who served and who I had the pleasure of serving with.”</p>

      <p>Despite the cold, hundreds gathered at the outdoor ceremony, which lasted about an hour as prayers were said, wreaths laid and respects paid.</p>
      <p>Much of the crowd could be seen shifting from foot to foot trying to keep warm. But suffering through the cold for an hour was the least they could do, said some, considering what they were gathered to remember.</p>
      <p>“As retired member of 24 years, I thought it was important that my children see and know what Remembrance Day is about and to pay respect to our fallen,” said Jason Bishoff, who worked as an aerospace telecommunications information systems (ATIS) technician with 17 Wing out of Winnipeg.</p>
      <p>As an ATIS tech, Bishoff was responsible for all technology not on the planes, from computers and servers on the ground and lasers to detect weather to radar on the runways.</p>

      <p>He did two tours in Bosnia, a tour in Romania/Lithuania where he worked on Baltic air policing mission and was stationed in a variety of cities in Ontario and Winnipeg before retiring and settling down in Regina.</p>
      <p>But Bishoff didn’t come to the Remembrance Day ceremony for himself. His mind was on all the others who have served.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t go to Afghanistan. I had many friends that did,” he said. “So, I think about my friends that didn’t come home.”</p>
      <p>One died in a vehicle explosion, he explained, and another got hit and killed during an attack. He also thinks about his grandfather who helped liberate the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>“I think back to what they went through and how good we really have it. It puts in perspective how lucky we are,” said Bishoff, as his six-year-old twins Justin and Samantha listened intently beside him.</p>

      <p>They get shy when he asks them to explain how dad talks about what Remembrance Day is and why it’s important, so he answers for them.</p>
      <p>“It’s important to remember,” he tells them. “We watch the videos that the legion puts out on TV. We talk about our grandpas. We know about daddy going away and it’s to remember all those, not just Canadians, but all those that have fallen.”</p>
      <p>In addition to the hundreds gathered at Victoria Park, thousands gathered at the annual indoor ceremony held at the Brandt Centre.</p>
      <p>“I like seeing people come out because it makes me feel supported for what I did,” said Welder. “I’m sure the veterans … from WWII, they’re happy when people come out because they feel supported as well.”</p>
