      <p>A Scottish <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/charity">charity worker</a> who was addicted to opiate-based painkillers died after she was "disgracefully" able to order the prescription-only drugs online.</p>
      <p>Debbie Headspeath, 41, who was from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> , purchased dangerously large quantities of the drug dihydrocodeine from online pharmacies because her GP was not prescribing enough to meet her addiction.</p>
      <p>An inquest was told how she hoodwinked doctors working for the pharmacies into giving her repeat prescriptions by pretending that she did not have enough time to visit her own GP.</p>

      <p>Ms Headspeath, who worked for a charity helping veterans with sight problems, and was described as "loving and compassionate", by her family collapsed and died on July 28, 2017, at her home in Ipswich, Suffolk.</p>
      <p>The hearing at Suffolk Coroner's <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/courts">Court</a> in Ipswich was told that her death was due to complications from pancreatitis, most likely caused by her long term addiction to codeine.</p>
      <p>Her GPs in the town first prescribed her dihydrocodeine, described as a weak opiate with 10 per cent of the strength of morphine, when she had back pain in 2008.</p>
      <p>But as her use of the drug continued over the years, her doctors became increasingly concerned and tried to wean her off it by gradually reducing her dose.</p>
      <p>She took out loans for £10,000 to pay for her secret purchases from 16 online suppliers in the six months before she died, often getting prescriptions from multiple outlets for the same period.</p>
      <p>The inquest was told that there was no central register of prescriptions due to patient confidentiality, meaning that online pharmacies were unable to check whether she was already being prescribed the drug.</p>
      <p>Ms Headspeath's mother Elaine Gardiner of Edinburgh angrily criticised the system at the hearing, saying it was "unacceptable" that patients could buy addictive drugs online without their GP knowing.</p>
      <p>She said: "It's just disgraceful that someone like my daughter can go to 16 different pharmacies and order an addictive drug and get it just like that.</p>

      <p>"It's crazy. It's ridiculous. She is not the only one. There have been many deaths from this. I am just wondering if lessons have been learned from my daughter's death and those like it."</p>
      <p>Mrs Gardiner said she had tested the system after her daughter's death, completing an online questionnaire to get the same drugs and had got to the stage where she had to enter her credit card numbers.</p>
      <p>She described the process as "very easy".</p>
      <p>She also called for more checks on patients trying to get online drugs, particularly as any addicted person would be more likely to lie in order to fool doctors into granting a prescription.</p>
      <p>Mrs Gardiner spoke out while questioning Dr Nigel Savage, the chief medical officer for Nationwide Pharmacies, which supplied her daughter with £750 of drugs over six months</p>
      <p>She told him: "If someone is addicted to something, they are not going to tell the truth. They are going to put what you want to hear. It is someone who you don't know, who you have never met and you don't know their medical history."</p>
      <p>Dr Savage told the hearing that Ms Headspeath had not been telling the truth by failing to disclose that she was getting drugs elsewhere at the same time, and pretending that she was trying to reduce her dose to avoid becoming dependent.</p>
      <p>He admitted: "It was the sort of thing that a doctor would want to hear from a patient."</p>
      <p>The inquest heard how Care Quality Commission rules for online pharmacies had since been tightened so that they could only supply opioid drugs to a patient after first being in contact with their GP.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>But there was no such safeguard in place when Ms Hudspeath was buying her drugs online.</p>
      <p>Her main GP Dr Peter Burn said he was "horrified" in 2011 when she admitted that she was buying large quantities of an over the counter pain killer containing Ibuprofen and small amounts of codeine to increase her dosage.</p>
      <p>He said it was "extremely dangerous" because a side effect of having large doses of the pain killer was possible kidney failure and death.</p>
      <p>As a result, he increased her prescription of dihydrocodeine to stop her taking the additional painkiller, and then gradually reduced it every week to try and wean her off gradually.</p>
      <p>He also repeatedly urged her to seek drug addiction treatment, but she only went to a handful of consultations because she worked for a women's refuge at the time and feared running into some of her clients in a waiting room.</p>
      <p>Dr Burn described her as "a respectable middle class girl" who did not like the idea of attending the drug treatment service called CRI, short for Crime Reduction Initiative.</p>
      <p>He added that she had mental capacity so he could not force her to do anything.</p>
      <p>Suffolk coroner's officer Stefan Jochan discovered Ms Hudspeath's online purchases when he checked her bank statements after her death.</p>
      <p>He said she would order supplies from each company every three or four weeks, spending up to £170 at a time.</p>
      <p>He made contact with the prescribing doctors from all 16 companies which supplied her including some in Romania, but only received replies from six in the UK.</p>
      <p>The inquest heard that two doctors from online pharmacy White Pharmacy had since been suspended for three months and six months.</p>
      <p>Suffolk senior coroner Nigel Parsley recorded a narrative conclusion that her death was a direct result of the "uncoordinated availability of codeine from multiple prescription suppliers".</p>
      <p>He added: "Due to there being no central record of prescriptions, she was able to obtain significant quantities of codeine with no medical supervision".</p>
      <p>Mr Parsley also he would also be writing a Regulation 28 letter to relevant authorities to try and prevent further deaths by highlighting the risks of pharmacies acting out CQC regulation, and the highlighting concerns about medical information not being shared.</p>
