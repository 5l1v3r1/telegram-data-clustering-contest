      <p>Juventus coach Maurizio Sarri has responded to claims superstar Cristiano Ronaldo left the stadium before their game against AC Milan on Sunday was finished. Could the five-time Ballon d'Or winner be in trouble?</p>

        </i>
      </p>
      <p>The 34-year-old was substituted after just 55 minutes in his side's 1-0 win over Milan on the weekend, with his replacement Paulo Dybala scoring the eventual winner.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo looked upset as he was taken off and walked straight down the tunnel, with <i>Calciomercato</i> suggesting that he left the stadium before the final whistle, and his manager Sarri has since responded to the reports.</p>

      </p>
      <p>"Disrespectful to his teammates? Like I said, I don't know," Sarri said, as quoted by the <i>Daily Express</i>, when asked about the rumours.</p>
      <p>"If it's true that he left before the end, it is a problem to be resolved with his teammates."</p>
      <p>Amid claims that Ronaldo himself had asked for his substitution, Sarri once again addressed the player's reaction after he walked straight down the tunnel.</p>
      <p>"The important thing is that he made himself available. If he gets angry when he comes out, this is part of the game," the Italian tactician added.</p>
      <p>“It's only natural a player is going to be irritated about leaving the pitch, especially when he worked so hard to be there.</p>
      <p>"All players who are trying to give their best will have at least five minutes of being annoyed when they are substituted, but a coach would, in general, be much more worried if he didn't seem upset."</p>

      <p>Juventus, who are yet to taste defeat in this campaign, remain at the top of the Serie A table, one point ahead of second-placed Inter Milan, with Liverpool being the only other unbeaten team in Europe's top five leagues this season.</p>
