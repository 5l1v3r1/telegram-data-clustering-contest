      <p>WASHINGTON - A federal judge in Washington has dismissed a lawsuit from U.S. President Donald Trump against New York officials aimed at preventing the release of his tax returns.</p>
      <p>The judge ruled that the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., does not have jurisdiction to hear the case.</p>
      <p>Trump sued New York's attorney general, tax commissioner and the House and Ways Means Committee in July. The suit sought an injunction to block the application of a New York state law that could allow the Democratic-controlled House to obtain the returns.</p>
      <p>New York officials had agreed to delay acting on a congressional request for Trump's tax returns until there was a ruling on jurisdiction. But Trump could file a similar lawsuit in another court.</p>
      <p>Trump's lawyer Jay Sekulow says he's reviewing the ruling.</p>
