      <p>Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency Wildlife Officer Roy Smith said the deer lingered in the room before exiting through a different window, <a href="https://www.wbir.com/article/news/local/deer-breaks-window-at-tennova-north-knoxville-medical-center/51-9d186ce7-f56d-4aed-8fb3-a7e3232abbcd">WBIR</a> reported.</p>
      <p>Three patients were evaluated for minor injuries but were later released, hospital spokeswoman Ann Metz told the television station.</p>
      <p>"Thanks to quick actions of our staff the area was made safe and animal control was called," Metz said.</p>
      <p>The deer ran from the hospital onto a road, where it was hit by a vehicle driven by Mike Smith, <a href="https://www.wvlt.tv/content/news/Deer-smashes-though-Powell-window-564758662.html">WVLT</a> reported.</p>
      <p>"White-tailed deer are in the breeding season, which is known as the rut," TWRA spokesman Matt Cameron told the television station. "During this time, both male and female deer become very active causing them to cross into urban areas and sometimes ending up in unusual places. When rutting bucks see their reflection in glass or mirrors, they will often ram what perceive as a potential competitor."</p>
