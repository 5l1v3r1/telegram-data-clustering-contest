      </p>
      <p>There has been no official word yet on how long Hayward will remain out for. Though Wojnarowski's report claimed that a timetable on his return will be determined after Monday's surgery. </p>
      <p>The 29-year-old was playing in his eighth game of the 2019-2020 season and was averaging 18.9 points per game - though that number went down from 20.3 points per game after he recorded just 9 points before the injury in Saturday's game. Both averages are his highest as a Celtic. </p>
      <p>Hayward missed nearly all of the 2017-2018 season after <a href="https://www.boston25news.com/sports/gordon-hayward-suffers-fractured-ankle-in-celtics-opener/626208732?fdg">breaking his ankle</a> in the first six minutes of the team's season opener against Cleveland. </p>
      <p>The Celtics (7-1) will take on the Dallas Mavericks (6-3) Monday night at Boston's TD Garden at 7:30 p.m.</p>
