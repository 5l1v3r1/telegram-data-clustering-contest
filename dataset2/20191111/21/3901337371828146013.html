      <p>Bafana Bafana will jet off to Ghana this evening, although had their first training session this morning.</p>
      <p>Molefi Ntseki’s boys assembled in to camp on Sunday evening after all the Absa Premiership action the past weekend, where they will now shift all their attention to this week’s opening 2021 Africa Cup Of Nations qualifier against Ghana.</p>
      <p>Bafana will play two qualifiers during this FIFA break, with a fixture against Sudan scheduled for this coming Sunday at the Orlando Stadium.</p>

      <p>This will be Bafana’s first competitive clash since exiting the 2019 Africa Cup Of Nations in the quarterfinals.</p>
      <p>The national have only played one international friendly encounter since then, after two of their scheduled fixtures were called off due to the previous Xenophobic attacks in the country.</p>
      <p>However, off the back of a win against Mali in the Nelson Mandela Challenge last month, Bafana will look to continue with their winning momentum and hopefully bring their first three points back home after Thursday.</p>
