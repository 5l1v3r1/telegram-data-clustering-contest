      <p>The Lib Dems have "immediately opened disciplinary investigations" into tweets that appear to have been posted by Kevin McNamara, the party's candidate for Thurrock.</p>
      <p>Screenshots of tweets circulating on Twitter show the parliamentary hopeful used racist and homophobic slurs in tweets sent in 2009 and 2010.</p>
      <p>His Twitter account has since been 'protected' - meaning only confirmed followers can see them.</p>
      <p>A screenshot of a tweet from 2011 appear to show Mr McNamara making a sexist comment.</p>
      <p>Various screenshots show him using the racial slur 'n*****' on several occasions in 2009 and 2010.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liberal-democrats">Liberal Democrats</a> told Mirror Online that "the party has immediately opened disciplinary investigations" into Kevin McNamara.</p>
