        <i>Former CEO, who presided over a tumultuous period at Uber, continues to profit even as company has major losses</i>
      </p>
      <p>The Uber co-founder and former chief executive <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/travis-kalanick">Travis Kalanick</a> is cashing in more than half a billion dollars<b> </b>of his stake in the ride share app, months after the company went public.</p>
      <p>After the end of the so-called “lockup period”, a 180-day restriction on inside and early investor sales, came to an end on Wednesday, Kalanick sold more than 20m shares, according to a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000156218019005432/xslF345X03/primarydocument.xml">financial filing</a> submitted to the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday.</p>
      <p>The sale represents some 21% of his stake in the ride-hailing company, worth nearly $547m, according to the filing. Kalanick owns about 75.4m shares in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/uber">Uber</a>, worth more than $2bn, based on their Friday closing.</p>
      <p>Kalanick was a controversial figure who presided over a tumultuous period for the company that included allegations of gender discrimination, sexual harassment and a toxic workplace culture. Kalanick resigned as chief executive in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/20/uber-ceo-travis-kalanick-resigns">2017 amid pressure from investors</a>.</p>
      <p>Executives like Kalanick continue to profit despite major losses for the company at large. Shares of Uber hit a record low of $25.58 on Wednesday, when trading restrictions on majority of the company’s 1.7bn outstanding shares were lifted.</p>
      <p>Uber <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/07/uber-wework-">lost $1.2bn</a> in the third quarter of 2019 and $5.24bn in the previous quarter. The San Francisco-based company’s shares were down 2.2% at $26.44 in morning trade on Monday. They have tumbled about 41% since the market debut in May.</p>
      <p>Uber, along with other gig economy giants such as Lyft and DoorDash, have taken steps in the past week to fight back against a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/11/california-passes-landmark-gig-economy-workers-rights-bill">landmark bill</a>, AB5, that would jeopardize the contractor status of ride-share and delivery drivers.</p>
      <p>At protests in support of the bill – which would allow drivers to organize in unions and increase their minimum wages, among other protections – many drivers referenced the profits Kalanick and others would make from the company’s public offering.</p>
      <p>Uber <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/may/09/uber-value-wall-street-ipo-friday">went public</a> in May of 2019 with a valuation of $82.4bn.</p>
