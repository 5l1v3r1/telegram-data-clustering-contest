      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kartik-Aaryan">Kartik Aaryan</a> and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Janhvi-Kapoor">Janhvi Kapoor</a> will be sharing the screen space for the first time with <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/'Dostana-2'">'Dostana 2'</a> along with <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Lakshya">Lakshya</a> who will be marking his debut.</p>
      <p>The film has been the talk of the town since the announcement. The cast of the film began filming the first leg in Chandigarh recently. Kartik even shared the picture of clapboard on his social media account. After completing the Chandigarh schedule, the team was going to shoot in Delhi, however, it was cancelled. Reportedly, as the capital city has become chamber and air pollution is at its peak, the shoot was called off!</p>
      <p>The report stated that the cast and crew were not able to breathe in the city. Also, even the camera couldn't capture the scenes properly due to low visibility. Hence, it was decided that they will not shoot until the weather improves.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, backed by <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Karan-Johar">Karan Johar</a>, the film is being helmed by Collin Dâ€™Cunha.</p>
