      <p>A two-year-old child is being rushed to a trauma centre after being struck by an air conditioning unit that fell from an apartment building in Scarborough.</p>
      <p>The incident occurred around 3:30 p.m. near Lawrence Avenue and Mossbank Drive.</p>
      <p>Police said that the air conditioning unit fell from the eight floor near the back entrance of the building.</p>
      <p>The child sustained life-threatening injuries, paramedics said, and is being transported to a pediatric trauma centre.</p>

      <p>As of 7 p.m., Toronto police had not released any new information about the child's condition.</p>
      <p>A resident who lives in the building said the incident is nervewracking, as her family walks through the back door on a regular basis.</p>
      <p>â€œThat could have been my child so, I sympathize with the parents right now," Sophria La-Foucade said.</p>
