      <p>The search for the Herolds Bay girl whose mother and brother died when their car went over a cliff has been called off, with the police scaling back to periodic patrols. </p>
      <p>"She is still missing," said Captain Malcom Pojie of six-year-old Cozette Scheepers. </p>
      <p>The alarm was raised when Heidi, Cozette and two-year-old Hugo went missing on October 22.</p>
      <p>On October 24, their vehicle, a VW Caravelle, was found at the bottom of a cliff when a search party noticed tyre tracks near a ledge in nearby Voelklip. </p>

      <p>The tracks were found on top of the more than 100m drop, and a search and rescue team, as well as a rescue craft and helicopter were activated to scour the area. </p>
      <p>Little Hugo's body was found in a gorge, and then on the Saturday Heidi's body was found, also in the sea.  </p>
      <p>Pojie said the police opened an inquest after concluding that they had drowned. </p>
      <p>They still do not know why the vehicle went over the cliff.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, Heidi's widower, Ettienne, put paid to rumours which included that they were in financial difficulty or had marital troubles in a report in the <a href="https://www.georgeherald.com/News/Article/General/scheepers-family-dismisses-rumours-201910290303">George Herald</a>.</p>
      <p>He said she had been through a bout of depression last year but had been treated.</p>
      <p>Cozette had attended a school for children with special needs. </p>
