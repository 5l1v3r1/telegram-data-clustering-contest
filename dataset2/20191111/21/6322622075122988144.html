      <h1>Tencent Falls $90 Billion Behind Alibaba After NBA China Clash</h1>

      <p>(Nov 12): Just a year ago, Tencent Holdings Ltd. locked up one of the most coveted media franchises in the country when it paid $1.5 billion for five years of exclusive streaming rights to National Basketball Association games. A single tweet changed all that.</p>
      <p>Now, the Chinese social media giant may have to suspend airing those matchups -- which drew half a billion viewers last year -- after Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey triggered a media blackout in China by tweeting support for Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protests. That sums up a disappointing 2019 for a company that looked like it was back on track after a horrendous 2018.</p>
      <p>At stake now for Tencent are billions of dollars in ad and subscription revenue, along with its strategy of becoming a go-to online destination for entertainment beyond gaming. Tencent was supposed to hit the comeback trail this year after a nine-month freeze on game approvals gutted its most profitable business in 2018. But a sharp Chinese economic slowdown, competition from up-and-comer ByteDance Inc. for internet traffic and advertising, and now tricky political considerations is snarling that recovery. That’s a key reason its stock has vastly under-performed arch rival Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. this year, creating a gap of more than $90 billion in their market valuation.</p>
      <p>“One of China’s biggest companies, who does everything right politically, stands to lose billions due to the political issues outside of its control,” Mark Tanner, founder and managing director of Shanghai-based consultancy China Skinny. “We’ve seen how the company has toed the line with the gaming rules recently and I expect they will be even more careful with this one.”</p>
      <p>Political issues aside, Tencent’s 2019 has not gone as well as investors anticipated. The company is projected to report barely any growth in net income when it announces September-quarter results Wednesday, because revenue growth is barely keeping up with the pace of spending on ever-costlier content and servers for its cloud and media services.</p>
      <p>But things are approving in its core gaming business, which still yields the majority of Tencent’s revenue. Widely ridiculed at the outset because of built-in party propaganda slogans -- the military advised on the project -- and family friendly gore-free rubric, 2019’s Peacekeeper Elite evolved into a breakout hit approaching the scale of longstanding cash cow Honour of Kings.</p>
      <p>Yet uncertainty shrouds the division as well. Earlier this month, state media reported that the nation’s publications regulator will cap online game playing time at 1.5 hours per day for children, a big demographic for Tencent’s mobile games.</p>
      <p>
        <b>    What Bloomberg Intelligence Says</b>
      </p>
      <p>“Tencent may deliver accelerating growth for its mobile games business, but its online advertising segment could stay tepid. 3Q mobile games’ sales growth could be the strongest in six quarters, based on Sensor Tower estimates. This is likely to be driven by the resilience of Honour of Kings, explosive growth of Peacekeeper Elite, and the low comparison base from 3Q18 stemming from China’s freeze on game approvals in March 2018.” - Bloomberg</p>
