      <h2>John Lawler yelled 'you are hurting me' as Dr Arleen Scholten manipulated his spine during a routine procedure.</h2>

      <p>A retired bank manager died a day after suffering a broken neck while being treated by a chiropractor during a routine visit.</p>
      <p>Grandfather-of-five John Lawler had sought treatment at a private Chiropractic 1st clinic in for an aching leg.</p>
      <p>But his wife, Joan Lawler told an inquest her husband suddenly yelled at chiropractor, Dr Arleen Scholten, 'you are hurting me' during what was supposed to be part of a procedure to manipulate his spine.</p>
      <p>She described the father-of-three, a former Barclays Bank manager, as looking like a "rag doll" after he lost consciousness during the appointment before paramedics arrived.</p>

      <p>The inquest heard Mrs Lawler, 83, was later told he had multiple spinal injuries and a broken neck and would need a traumatic 14-hour operation to fit a brace.</p>
      <p>Mr Lawler, 80, was taken to Leeds General <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/hospitals">Infirmary</a> immediately after the appointment but did not have the operation.</p>
      <p>The inquest heard Mr Lawler "just faded away" the next day in hospital surrounded by his heartbroken family.</p>
      <p>It was reported last year no one was to face <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/police">criminal charges</a> over his death in 2017, following a police investigation.</p>
      <p>A woman - who had been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter following his death - was released without charge and the matter was passed to the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/courts">coroner</a> .</p>
      <p>Giving evidence at the start of an inquest at York Racecourse yesterday, Mr Lawler's wife of more than 50 years Joan gave a harrowing account of what happened.</p>
      <p>Mrs Lawler told how her husband was on the treatment table at Chiropractic 1st in York when things started to go wrong.</p>
      <p>She said he started shouting at chiropractor Dr Arleen Scholten, 'you are hurting me. You are hurting me'.</p>
      <p>An inquest heard, Mr Lawler then began moaning and said: "I can't feel my arms."</p>
      <p>Mrs Lawler said Dr Scholten tried to turn him over and then manoeuvred him into a chair next to the treatment table but he had become unresponsive.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"He was like a rag doll," she added. "His lips looked a little bit blue but I knew he was breathing.</p>
      <p>"I said, 'Has he had a stroke?' She put his head back and said 'no, his features are symmetrical'.</p>
      <p>"She started shouting to get an ambulance."</p>
      <p>Mrs Lawler said paramedics arrived, treated her husband, took him to hospital before he was later transferred to Leeds General Infirmary.</p>
      <p>He had an MRI scan and a doctor told her he had suffered a broken neck, an inquest heard.</p>
      <p>Mrs Lawler was then told bluntly her husband was a paraplegic and he could undergo a 14-hour operation which would be traumatic but he later "faded away" and died.</p>
      <p>The inquest, which is expected to last all week, continues.</p>
