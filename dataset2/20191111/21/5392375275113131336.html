      <p>Singles Day aka 11.11 celebration is the worshipped commerce day, when all the hell breaks loose and billions are flying out of the window. It’s also the perfect time to do some shopping for gadgets, because it’s very often the best prices available too. And most of the shops and gadget makers are falling head over heels to offer the ideal deal for the customers. Chinese phone makers ELEPHONE are no exception to such rule and for the 11.11 sales they are mainly promoting the new ELEPHONE PX model.</p>
      <p>ELEPHONE PX is sporting a big 6,53-inch full-screen display with 19.3:9 aspect ratio, FHD+ resolution and 93,1% screen-to-body ratio. That’s thanks to the pop-up selfie camera module with 16MP sensor, so no distracting notch is needed. Inside you can find Helio P23 <a href="http://www.gizchina.com/tag/processor">processor</a>, 4 GB RAM, 64 GB of internal storage, rear fingerprint scanner, 3300 mAh battery capacity, 16MP+2MP dual rear main camera sensors with AI support or the Android 9 Pie system. The phone is available in Breathing Crystal or Lumia Purple colors for the additional fancy design.</p>

      <p>You can find the phone <a href="http://bit.ly/2PUSAzA">on Aliexpress for just $121.59</a> in both available colors, but you have to hurry up a bit, because the 11.11 are not going to last long and are usually over in a day or two. So if you are one of ELEPHONE fans then surely check out this offer, because it’s most likely not going to get much cheaper. You can learn more about the phone on the <a href="http://bit.ly/2nQIbsE">official website</a> too of course.</p>
