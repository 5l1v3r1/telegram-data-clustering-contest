      <p>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Mini Mercury skipped across the vast, glaring face of the sun Monday in a rare celestial transit.</p>
      <p>Stargazers used solar-filtered binoculars and telescopes to spot Mercury -- a tiny black dot -- as it passed directly between Earth and the sun on Monday.</p>
      <p>The eastern U.S. and Canada got the whole 5 1/2-hour show, weather permitting, along with Central and South America. The rest of the world, except for Asia and Australia, got just a sampling.</p>
      <p>Mercury is the solar system's smallest, innermost planet. The next transit isn't until 2032, and North America won't get another shot until 2049.</p>
      <p>In Maryland, clouds prevented NASA solar astrophysicist Alex Young from getting a clear peek. Live coverage was provided by observatories including NASA's orbiting Solar Dynamics Observatory.</p>
      <p>"It's a bummer, but the whole event was still great," Young wrote in an email. "Both getting to see it from space and sharing it with people all over the country and world."</p>
      <p>At Cape Canaveral, space buffs got a two-for-one. As Mercury's silhouette graced the morning sun, SpaceX launched 60 small satellites for global internet service, part of the company's growing Starlink constellation in orbit.</p>
