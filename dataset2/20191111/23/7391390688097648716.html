      <p><i>The Good Place</i>’s resident Blake Bortles fan helped make a marriage proposal happen in real life. <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/vulture-festival-2019-the-good-place-manny-jacinto-proposal.html">Manny Jacinto is engaged — and <i>The Good Place </i>inspired</a> him to pop the question to his longtime girlfriend Dianne Doan. Jacinto confirmed his engagement at the 2019 Vulture Festival in Los Angeles on Saturday, Nov. 9. In a panel discussion alongside his <i>Good Place </i>co-stars D’Arcy Carden and Marc Evan Jackson, Jacinto revealed that his role as the lovable airhead and Florida native Jason Mendoza in the series emboldened him to propose to Doan.</p>
      <p>“I was toying when to pop the question for a long time,” Jacinto said at the panel, per <i>Vulture</i>. “I looked at the Janet/Jason relationship, and there’s a sentence that Jason says to Chidi about relationships and it hit me pretty hard. I thought it was a sign that I needed to do it, and a week later I popped the question.”</p>
      <p>For his proposal, Jacinto took Doan to meaningful locations that were their "firsts" before popping the question. “Where I first met her, where I first saw her, where we had our first date, and where we had our first dance class,” Jacinto said. “I had these canvas things written down with a message saying why the places were important to us… I took her through five different places, and at the last place I had our families waiting and I proposed.”</p>

      <p>Doan is a Canadian actor whose credits include the Disney TV movie <i>Descendants</i>, Freeform series <i>Good Trouble</i>, and Cinemax series <i>Warrior</i>. Jacinto is best known for his <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/jason-mendozas-13-best-good-place-moments-will-make-you-fall-in-love-with-the-character-all-over-again-13098096">breakout role as Jason in <i>The Good Place</i></a>, an NBC comedy that follows a group of people, demons, and all-knowing Siri-like entity (not a girl) in the afterlife.</p>
      <p>The acclaimed series, which also stars Ted Danson, Kristen Bell, William Jackson Harper, and Jameela Jamil, is set to end in January 2020 after a four-season run. Deadline reported last week that the series <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/the-good-place-90-minute-series-finale-post-show-special-hosted-seth-meyers-1202781369/">would bid farewell with an extended 90-minute episode </a>block. The Jan. 30 finale will also include a special post-show hosted by Seth Meyers and feature the entire cast.</p>
      <p>At the Vulture Festival panel, the <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/vulture-festival-2019-darcy-carden-the-good-place-finale.html">cast remained mum about the Season 4 finale with Carden</a> noting that she would spend “the rest of eternity” in the “special” series finale. Jackson, on the other hand, offered a spoiler that remained true to the series and said, “Things transpire. Others don’t. End of <i>The Good Place</i>.”</p>
