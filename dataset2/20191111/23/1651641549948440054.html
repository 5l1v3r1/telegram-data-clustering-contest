Food Network Kitchen subscribers will also be able to take live and on demand cooking classes from Food Network chefs, get step-by-step cooking instructions, and have access to tens of thousands of recipes.</p>
      <p>The smart display also supports Amazon’s Prime Video and YouTube.</p>
      <p>The Echo Show 8 will retail for $129.99 but Amazon has a pre-launch discount of $30, meaning you can reserve one for less than $100.</p>
