      <p>WEST HOLLYWOOD, Nov 12 — The next adventure in the <i>Star Wars</i> movie and TV franchise, arriving today on Walt Disney Co’s new streaming service, takes place on a lawless planet at the outer reaches of the galaxy.</p>
      <p><i>The Mandalorian</i>, an eight-episode live-action series, stars <i>Game of Thrones</i> actor Pedro Pascal as a helmeted bounty hunter. It will be available on Disney+, a new US$7-per-month (RM29-per-month) online subscription meant to compete with Netflix Inc</p>
      <p>As is typical with <i>Star Wars</i>, Disney and the cast have revealed little about the plot.</p>
      <p>“Just kind of imagine crossing the borders and going into unknown territory ... with a lot of familiar elements and completely brand new elements,” Pascal said in an interview with Reuters.</p>
      <p><i>The Mandalorian</i> is set between the events of <i>Return of the Jedi</i> and <i>The Force Awakens</i>, the sixth and seventh instalments in the <i>Star Wars</i> movie saga.</p>
      <p>Disney will release the first episode today and the second on Friday, followed by one instalment each Friday after that. — Reuters</p>
