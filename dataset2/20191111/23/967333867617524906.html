      <p>Light’s antics were recorded by Ross Halley, who <a href="https://uk.news.yahoo.com/englishman-rides-jet-ski-village-234441841.html?guccounter=1">told</a> Storyful that he’d initially found out about the watercraft adventure after Light posted on a local Facebook page asking if any residents minded him messing about in the flooded area.</p>
      <blockquote>Although some believed Light to be joking, they soon discovered he was not trying to practice his comedic skills. “Within half an hour [of the Facebook post going live], he was riding the Jet Ski around the massive puddle,” Halley explained.</blockquote>

      <p>It’s unclear if any community members appreciated or objected to Light’s move to take advantage of the flooding.</p>
