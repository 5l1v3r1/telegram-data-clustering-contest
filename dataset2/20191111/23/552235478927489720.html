      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T23:14:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 23:14</time> by <a rel="author">Scott Burns, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/scott-burns/</a></address>
      <p>Pep Guardiola has phoned <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a> to back Raul Caneda Perez’s push to become their next manager.</p>
      <p>Experienced Perez is currently in charge at Qatari side Umm Salal but wants to succeed Paul Heckingbottom at Easter Road.</p>
      <p>Hibs have held talks with the 50-year-old over the past 48 hours as they begin to draw up a shortlist.</p>
      <p>And <i><b>Record Sport</b></i> can reveal <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> boss Guardiola has called Hibs sporting director Graeme Mathie to recommend Perez.</p>
      <p>The duo first met when Guardiola was seeing out his playing days in Mexico with Dorados and Perez was assistant boss.</p>

      <p>Perez has worked as an external analyst for Guardiola at Barcelona and Manchester City, studying Champions League opponents.</p>
      <p>He was also assistant boss at Real Sociedad and Almeria before becoming a manager eight years ago.</p>
      <p>Perez enjoyed successful spells at Saudi clubs Al Ittihad and Al-Nassr before joining Umm Salal.</p>
      <p>He has a wealth of experience in the Asian Champions League and has also written a coaching book back in Spain.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Former Sunderland boss Jack Ross and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> assistant John Kennedy are two other candidates, while ex-Notts County manager Harry Kewell took in Hibs’ weekend win over St Johnstone.</p>
      <p>Celtic boss <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a> has issued a hands-off warning over Kennedy while former Hibs gaffers Alan Stubbs and John Hughes are keen on a return but not in the running for the job.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/motherwell-fc">Motherwell</a>'s Stephen Robinson was also under consideration but the Hibees are reluctant to pay compensation while veteran German Felix Magath’s application has been dismissed.</p>
