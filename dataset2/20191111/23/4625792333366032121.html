      <h1>Deval Patrick considering last-minute White House bid</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T23:08:27+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 23:08</time> by <a rel="author">Naomi Lim</a></address>
      <p>Former Democratic Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick is reconsidering a run for his party's 2020 presidential nomination.</p>
      <p>Citing the lack of excitement generated by the other candidates, as well as their failure to unite centrist and liberal Democrats, Patrick has expressed concerns to top Democratic officials about the crowded primary field's ability to take on President Trump next year, according to the <i><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/us/politics/deval-patrick-2020-president.html">New York Times</a></i><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/us/politics/deval-patrick-2020-president.html">.</a></p>
      <p>The 63-year-old two-term governor's potential foray into the contest, less than 100 days before the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 3, follows reports last week that Michael Bloomberg is <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/michael-bloomberg-reportedly-preparing-to-jump-into-2020-presidential-race">preparing to launch a last-minute campaign.</a> It also precedes Friday's filing deadline for the New Hampshire primary, set for Feb. 11.</p>
      <p>Patrick, a Bain Capital managing director and alumnus of the Clinton Justice Department, was an outspoken supporter of Democrats running for office during the 2018 midterm election cycle. He also met with former President Barack Obama and Obama administration veterans to discuss the prospect of a White House bid before declining to declare his candidacy.</p>
      <p>"After a lot of conversation, reflection and prayer, I’ve decided that a 2020 campaign for president is not for me. I’ve been overwhelmed by advice and encouragement from people from all over the country, known and unknown. Humbled, in fact," he <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/deval-patrick-bows-out-of-2020-presidential-contention">wrote on Facebook last December</a>. "But knowing that the cruelty of our elections process would ultimately splash back on people whom Diane and I love, but who hadn’t signed up for the journey, was more than I could ask," he added, referring to his wife.</p>
      <p>Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts last week floated Patrick's name as a possible member of her cabinet should she win the White House next fall.</p>
