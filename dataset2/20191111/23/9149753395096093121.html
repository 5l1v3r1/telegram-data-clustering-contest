      <h1>Corsair's Void Pro RGB headset is $60, its lowest price yet</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T23:04:21+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 23:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/corbin-davenport/" target="_blank">Corbin Davenport</a></address>
      <p>If you're in the market for a <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/best-gaming-headset/">gaming headset</a>, you don't have to wait for <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/black-friday-deals-2019-gaming/">Black Friday</a>. Corsair's Void Pro RGB headset has now dropped to $59.99 at multiple retailers, a $10 drop from the usual price, and $40 off the original MSRP. While <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/corsairs-void-pro-headset-is-down-to-dollar50-right-now/">other variants of the Corsair Void Pro have been cheaper</a>, this wireless model with RGB lighting has traditionally been more expensive.</p>
      <p>The model on sale offers 50mm neodymium speaker drivers, a wireless range of about 40 feet, a maximum battery life of 16 hours, a retractable microphone, and (of course) RGB lighting. Custom lighting can be configured using Corair's 'CUE' desktop software.</p>
      <p>The Void Pro connects to your PC (or game console) using a USB wireless adapter, so you don't have to worry about janky Bluetooth connections. You can grab the headset from the links below.</p>
