      <p>GUWAHATI, India: An elephant named after the late Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden that <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/rogue-elephant-named-after-bin-laden-kills-five-indian-villagers-12056032">killed five Indian villagers</a> has been caught after a massive operation to hunt down the creature, officials said on Monday (Nov 11).</p>
      <p>Wildlife officers tracked the pachyderm - dubbed "Laden" by the locals it menaced in northeastern Assam state - through a forest for several days using drones and domesticated elephants.</p>

      <p>"We started the final leg of the operation today ... Two darts were fired by experts which had tranquilised the male elephant," a senior forestry official told AFP.</p>
      <p>"Now the work is on to shift the elephant to a forest where there is no human habitation nearby."</p>
      <p>The animal killed five people, including three women, during a 24-hour rampage through Goalpara district October.</p>
      <p>Officials said they would take the elephant's welfare into account as well as the safety of people living nearby in deciding where it would be relocated</p>
      <p>Nearly 2,300 people have been killed by elephants in India over the last five years, according to official figures released in June, while 700 elephants have been killed since 2011 - figures resulting in part from shrinking natural habitats.</p>
      <p>Elephants frequently migrate into Goalpara, resulting in high numbers of fatal encounters with humans amid rampant deforestation.</p>
      <p>Some elephants there have been poisoned or shot by locals, while others have died on electric fences or on railways cutting through migration routes.</p>
