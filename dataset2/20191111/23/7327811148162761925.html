      <p>NEW YORK -- New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo says application fees for the State University of New York and City University of New York systems will be waived for veterans and their spouses.</p>
      <p>The Democrat announced the new measure Sunday. He says he hopes this change will allow veterans and their families to "take the next steps in adapting back to civilian life."</p>
      <p>The SUNY and CUNY systems require applicants to pay a fee ranging from $50 to $65.</p>
      <p>The Board of Trustees for both CUNY and SUNY will include resolutions to implement the change at their next board meetings.</p>
      <p>Cuomo also says several state landmarks will be lit red, white and blue on Nov. 11 in recognition of Veteran's Day.</p>
