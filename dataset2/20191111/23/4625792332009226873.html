      <h1>Bodyguards and backpacks full of cash: Russian influence operation hits Madagascar elections</h1>

      <p>Russian agents launched a large election influence operation in Madagascar in 2017 in an apparent attempt to win political favor with the administration and secure profitable business operations in the country.</p>
      <p>The Russian influence operation was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/world/africa/russia-madagascar-election.html">directed</a> by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a Russian businessman and close adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to the <i>New York Times</i>. The United States has indicted Prigozhin for running election influence operations in the U.S. in 2016.</p>
      <p>Prior to Madagascar's last presidential election in 2018, Prigozhin bought a large stake in a Malagasy government-run company selling chromium, a key mineral used in stainless steel production. Prigozhin agreed to support former Madagasy President Hery Rajaonarimampianina in a secret meeting attended by Prigozhin, Putin, and Rajaonarimampianina, according to Russian officials.</p>
      <p>Prigozhin ran an influence campaign to help Rajaonarimampianina that included Russian agents with backpacks full of cash offering bribes to opponents to drop out and paying journalists for positive coverage. Russian agents would also show up to opponents' campaign offices with armed bodyguards to intimidate them into dropping out.</p>
      <p>Russian agents also funded and pushed the campaign of a Malagasy cult leader, Church of the Apocalypse founder and pastor André Christian Dieudonné Mailhol. The Mailhol campaign was an apparent attempt to split support for Rajaonarimampianina's opponents.</p>
      <p>The Russian interference operation was far from professional and was plagued by grifts from its own agents. Agents making purchases for their work would often ask for receipts that showed a price double what they actually paid for goods or services so they could pocket the difference when they filed for reimbursements.</p>
      <p>Also, the interference operation did not win Rajaonarimampianina reelection. He lost his reelection bid to challenger Andry Rajoelina. Russian agents made a late switch to campaign for Rajoelina after realizing that Rajaonarimampianina's campaign was doomed. After taking office, Rajoelina allowed Prigozhin to keep his stake in the chromium company.</p>
      <p>Prigozhin was a major player in Russian attempts to <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/editorials/on-russian-meddling-rather-than-a-do-over-how-about-democrats-do-something">influence</a> the 2016 presidential election in the U.S. and is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/11/yevgeny-prigozhin-who-is-the-man-leading-russias-push-into-africa">connected</a> with various businesses and paramilitary groups.</p>
      <p>Prigozhin is currently spearheading Russia's campaign to expand its influence across Africa. He has made deals with a slate of authoritarian leaders across the continent, promising to support their hold on power in return for favors and access, often to profitable, state-run businesses.</p>
