      <p>SAN DIEGO -- Many across California witnessed a row of fluttering lights in the night sky were left pondering possibilities, including the existence of aliens and, well, Santa.</p>
      <p>SpaceX <a href="https://www.space.com/spacex-starlink-launch-fourth-rocket-landing-success.html">launched 60 new Starlink satellites into orbit</a> Monday night. The Starlink satellites are part of Elon Musk's mission to create a space-based broadband internet system.</p>
      <p>"With performance that far surpasses that of traditional satellite internet, and a global network unbounded by ground infrastructure limitations, Starlink will deliver high speed broadband internet to locations where access has been unreliable, expensive, or completely unavailable," Starlink said on its website.</p>
      <p>The sky was clear enough for people to catch the lights streaming into space.</p>
      <p>"Wtf is in the sky rn," wrote <a href="https://twitter.com/AClark991/status/1194071887371894785">Angel Clark on Twitter</a> .</p>
      <p>"I saw it. My whole family did. From San Diego. Heading south. It was about 9 or so lights. All on a line," wrote <a href="https://twitter.com/ConcertedCitiz1/status/1194078240081530881">Bill the Butcher</a> .</p>
      <p>The glow from the satellites were visible across San Diego ... all the way<i> to infinity and beyond</i>.</p>
      <p>"Moon directly behind me, lights moving right to left. In Thousand Oaks, CA on a night hike.
