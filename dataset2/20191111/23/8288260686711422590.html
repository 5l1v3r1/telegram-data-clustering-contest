      <p>Tesco has been forced to remove an advertisement featuring Spice Girls star Mel B.</p>
      <p>Britain's biggest grocer runs multiple stores across Birmingham and throughout the Midlands.</p>
      <p>But Tesco has made the unusual move of withdrawing an ad featuring the popular celebrity.</p>
      <p>Tesco has pulled the advert after she furiously outed it online on Monday, November 11.</p>
      <p>The image of the singer, also known as Scary Spice, was used in an advert for the supermarket's new Clubcard Plus.</p>
      <p>Alongside an image of Mel in a leopard print catsuit, taken at the Brit Awards in 1997, the advert reads: "Stop right now. You get 10% off two big shops a month for £7.99."</p>

      <p>Another text bubble adds: "Thank you very Much."</p>
      <p>And any fans of the girl power promoters will know the advert is a play on words from the group's hit 1997 single Stop.</p>
      <p>Posting an image of a bus stop advert on Instagram , the Leeds-born singer wrote to her 1.5m followers: "Can the CEO OF TESCO DAVE LEWIS PLEASE CONTACT ME URGENTLY. Thank you."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Tesco said it has now removed the image from its campaign.</p>
      <p>A Tesco spokesman said: "Here at Tesco we are really big fans of Mel B and were excited to feature her photo in our campaign.</p>
      <p>"We had authorisation to use this image, but we're sorry Mel B is unhappy so we've stopped using it."</p>
      <p>The advert was part of Tesco's latest campaign that features cultural references from the past 100 years for its 100th anniversary, with the tagline: "Prices that take you back".</p>
      <p>Other celebrities, including comedy duo Morecambe and Wise, have also been used in the campaign.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Comedian Joe Lycett joked: "Let me know if you need any help with this babe x."</p>
      <p>"Oh dear oh dear @tescofood you messed right up," added a fan.</p>
      <p>Another said: "Uh oh... Someone's in trouble!"</p>
      <p>"#DavesInTheDogHouse," joked a fourth.</p>
