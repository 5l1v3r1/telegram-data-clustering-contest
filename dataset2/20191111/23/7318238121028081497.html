      <h1>Polish far-right groups march in Warsaw on independence anniversary</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T23:40:45+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 23:40</time> by <a rel="author">ReutersÂ </a></address>
      <p>Tens of thousands of Poles took part in a far-right march in the capital Warsaw on Monday to mark Polish independence, an annual event that has become a focus of friction between nationalists and liberals.</p>
      <p>Some chanted "God, honour, homeland!" and "No to the European Union!" and waved red-and-white Polish flags. Others lit red flares, blanketing sections of the parade with smoke.</p>
      <p>"We have to return to our roots. Our world has abandoned God and Christianity," Robert Bakiewicz, head of a group organising the march, told participants in central Warsaw. "We will die as the nations of western Europe are dying."</p>
      <p>A small group of hardline Italian far-right group Forza Nuova members also took part, waving flags.</p>
      <p>Poland has become increasingly polarised since the nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party came to power in 2015, calling for a revival of patriotic and Roman Catholic values in public life and a rejection of Western liberalism.</p>

      <p>Critics say PiS, which won a second term last month with 44% of the vote, has tacitly encouraged groups with roots in the fascist and anti-Semitic movements of the 1930s that organise the march, although the party denies this.</p>
      <p>Last year, on the centenary of Polish independence, government officials and President Andrzej Duda, an ally of the PiS, agreed to hold a joint event with the annual march organisers, but walked at a distance, away from any overt displays of nationalism.</p>
      <p>This year, PiS held its own, separate events.</p>
      <p>"Our nation has a mission and it has to fulfil it," PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski said on Sunday. "Our mission is to sustain everything that's a foundation of our Christian civilisation. We will walk this path, and if it's done in a thoughtful way, it will bring us to victory."</p>
      <p>On Nov. 11, Poles commemorate the establishment in 1918 of the second Polish republic, created after World War One from parts of what was then Russia, Germany and Austria.</p>
      <p>Two years ago, the march was dotted with racist banners, some of them reading "Pure blood, clear mind" or "Europe will be white or uninhabited".</p>
      <p>Before PiS came to power, scuffles between participants and police were not uncommon, but in recent years, more families with children have joined.</p>
      <p>Another far-right march, in the southwestern city of Wroclaw, was ended by city authorities due to racist remarks 25 minutes after it had begun.</p>
      <p>"The march was dissolved (...) due to hate-speech (anti-Semitism) and the use of pyrotechnics," the vice-president of the Wroclaw City Council, Bartlomiej Ciazynski, wrote on Facebook, adding that several hundred people took part in the march.</p>
