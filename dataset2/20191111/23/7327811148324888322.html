      <p>WOODCLIFF LAKE, New Jersey (WABC) -- A community in New Jersey celebrated Veterans Day by honoring 21 of their residents who served in the military.</p>
      <p>Local political leaders joined the staff at The Bristal at Woodcliff Lake Assisted Living on Monday to recognize veterans who range in age from 74 to 95.</p>
      <p>Some of the men had just married and left their families to join the service after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor.</p>
      <p>They say it's something they would do again.</p>
      <p>"It was a rough start to a new life at 19 and go to war," Louis Raspanti said. "It was something you would never trade but you keep it back there in your mind, it helps a lot of times, you have a difficult situation, you fall back on that experience, and it pulls you out of other bad situations."</p>
      <p>Veterans Day is a time for all to remember the men and women who showed up and pledged their lives.</p>
      <p>"My parents didn't know where I was, they knew the location, but they didn't know what I was doing, it was kept too secret," said Tom Thompson with the Naval Reserve.</p>
      <p>Director Michelle Braccino works to make sure every Veterans Day is their day.</p>
      <p>"I want to make sure I show them how appreciative we are of what they did. I've lost some and I get teary-eyed because I miss them," she said.</p>
      <p>Organizers honor the men every year so they will always know how much they are appreciated.</p>
