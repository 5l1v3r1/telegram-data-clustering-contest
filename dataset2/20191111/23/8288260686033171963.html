      <h1>Emilia Clarke's three-word message to Brits ahead of general election</h1>
      <h2>Clarke hopes the seasonal tale and its message will resonate in Brexit Britain, and said it is "vital" to tell the stories of the dispossessed</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T23:16:11+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 23:16</time> by <a rel="author">James Rodger, https://www.facebook.com/jamesrodgerjournalist</a></address>
      <p>Emilia Clarke has said "we can dream" about her latest film influencing the upcoming General Election with a message about Brexit.</p>
      <p>Last Christmas follows the fraught life of a refugee in London, whose life is changed during the festive period.</p>
      <p>Clarke hopes the seasonal tale and its message will resonate in Brexit Britain, and said it is "vital" to tell the stories of the dispossessed.</p>
      <p>The Game Of Thrones star said the message of the movie, co-written by Dame Emma Thompson, is important in the current political climate.</p>
      <p>Asked if the message could prove timely ahead of a divisive General Election, she told the PA news agency: "There's a chance, right, there's a chance.</p>

      <p>"We can all dream. But we could, we could just do it."</p>
      <p>The star spoke at the premiere of Last Christmas at the BFI Southbank in London, where she was joined by director Paul Feig and Dame Emma.</p>
      <p>Her co-star and love interest in the film, Henry Golding, also made an appearance on the red carpet.</p>
      <p>Clarke, whose character is part of a refugee family from the former Yugoslavia, believes such stories of suffering should be more prominent following the Brexit referendum.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>She said: "I think it's hugely important. We don't get to hear this side of the story very often.</p>
      <p>"This was an actual human tale where you got to live with that family, and you got to see what that might feel like where you have been brought from your home and placed in another, and just trying to make the best out of it.</p>
      <p>"I think it's vital that these stories keep getting told regardless of the outcome."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Dame Emma has been outspoken in her criticism of the decision to leave the EU.</p>
      <p>The film is released in cinemas on November 15.</p>
