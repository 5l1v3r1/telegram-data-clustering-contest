      <p>Police are investigating a string of egg attacks in Brooklyn over the weekend as possible anti-Semitic hate crimes, the NYPD said Monday.</p>
      <p>On Saturday around 6:15 p.m., a group of people threw eggs at a synagogue in Borough Park, according to police.</p>
      <p>No person was hit in the incident, but the group, who threw the eggs from the street, managed to hit a wall inside the synagogue, authorities said.</p>
      <p>Just a day later on Sunday, around 4:15 p.m., police said a group of at least three people ran up and threw eggs at a 50-year-old woman's back as she walked in Borough Park, just a few blocks from Saturday's synagogue egging.</p>
      <p>The group didn't say anything to the woman and no injuries were reported, officials said.</p>
      <p>The NYPD is investigating both incidents, as well as a third unconfirmed incident which <a href="https://twitter.com/BPShomrim/status/1193376764204072960">Boro Park Shomrim tweeted</a> surveillance video from.</p>
      <p>The alleged attacks come a mid <a href="https://pix11.com/2019/09/04/theres-been-a-surge-in-anti-semitic-hate-crimes-in-nyc-police-say/">a rise in anti-Semitic crimes</a> across New York City. More than half the hate crimes reported in the city so far this year are anti-Semitic, NYPD officials said in September.</p>
      <p>While most of the incidents reported are acts of vandalism, as a whole, anti-Semitic hate crimes in New York City are up 63% this year as compared with last year, officials have said.</p>
