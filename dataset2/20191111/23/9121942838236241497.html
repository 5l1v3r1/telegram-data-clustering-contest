      <h1>Trump, Macron to meet after French president criticized NATO</h1>

      <p>PARIS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron says he will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump ahead of the Dec. 3-4 NATO summit in London.</p>
      <p>Macron tweeted that he had an “excellent discussion” with Trump on Monday evening about Syria, Iran and the NATO military alliance. They evoked “lots of convergences,” he said, without elaborating.</p>
      <p>The phone call comes after Macron claimed last week that a lack of U.S. leadership is causing the “brain death” of NATO and said the European Union must step up and start acting as a strategic world power.</p>
      <p>Trump’s preoccupation with defense spending has been a constant theme since he came to office in 2016 and is expected to feature at the Dec. 3-4 summit in London.</p>
