      <p>RIYADH, Nov 12 — A man stabbed three performers at a live show in Saudi Arabia’s capital and was arrested, state television reported yesterday, adding that the victims were in stable condition.</p>
      <p>The incident occurred at King Abdullah Park in central Riyadh, one of several venues hosting a two-month long entertainment festival as part of government efforts to open up Saudi society and diversify its economy away from oil.</p>
      <p>Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has eased social restrictions and promoted entertainment previously banned in the conservative Muslim kingdom, risking a backlash from religious critics.</p>
      <p>State news agency SPA described the assailant as a 33-year-old Yemeni resident.</p>
      <p>The motivation for the attack was not immediately clear. Saudi Arabia intervened in Yemen’s civil war in 2015 against the Iran-aligned Houthis.</p>
      <p>SPA said the victims, two men and a woman, sustained “superficial wounds” and were stabilized after receiving medical care.</p>
      <p>A video tweeted by state television Al Ekhbariya appeared to show a man in street clothes rushing the stage towards a group of costumed performers and then falling to the ground as someone else chased him.</p>
      <p>Another online video showed the scene from another angle, as the assailant tumbled off the stage and the performers fled.</p>
      <p>The “Riyadh Season” festival’s website said the offerings at the park include live shows and music, light installations, wall climbing and zip lining. — Reuters</p>
