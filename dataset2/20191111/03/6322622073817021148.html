      <h1>Alibaba Singles' Day sales hit US$23b in first nine hours</h1>

      <p>HANGZHOU, China (Nov 11): Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Inc on Monday said sales for its annual Singles' Day shopping blitz hit 158.31 billion yuan (US$22.63 billion) in its first nine hours, up 25% from 126.72 billion yuan at the same point last year.</p>
      <p>Akin to Black Friday and Cyber Monday in the United States, Singles' Day has been promoted as a shopping fest by Alibaba Chairman and Chief Executive Daniel Zhang since 2009, growing rapidly to become the world's biggest online sales event.</p>
      <p>Also known as "Double Eleven", the festival's name originates from the calendar date Nov 11, with the four ones of 11/11 signifying being single.</p>
      <p>Alibaba netted sales worth US$30 billion on its platforms on Singles' Day last year, dwarfing the US$7.9 billion US online sales for Cyber Monday. Yet the 27% sales growth was the lowest in the event's 10-year history, spurring a search for fresh ideas.</p>
      <p>Citic Securities, in a Nov 9 research note, forecast Singles Day sales to grow 20-25% this year, held back partly by slowing overall e-commerce growth in China.</p>
      <p>The Chinese retail juggernaut, with a market value of US$486 billion, kicked off this year's 24-hour shopping fest with performances by American pop star Taylor Swift and local celebrities such as Jackson Yee.</p>
      <p>Sales hit US$1 billion in the first minute and eight seconds and reached 84 billion yuan in the first hour, up 22% from last year's early haul of 69 billion yuan.</p>
      <p>Singles' Day was among the top trending topics on China's Twitter-like Weibo microblogging platform on Monday morning, with users discussing what they spent their money on.</p>
      <p>Alibaba has said it expects over 500 million users to participate in the shopping festival this year, about 100 million more than last year.</p>
      <p>This is the first time Alibaba's Singles' Day does not have flamboyant co-founder Jack Ma at its helm, after he resigned in September as chairman to "start a new life".</p>
      <p>It also comes at a crucial time for the company, which is looking to raise up to US$15 billion via a share sale in Hong Kong this month.</p>
      <p>Alibaba continues to dominate the online shopping industry, but not without competition.</p>
      <p>In addition to longtime rival JD.com Inc, it also faces competition from Pinduoduo Inc, which surged in popularity in 2017 by targeting consumers in China's lower-tier cities.</p>
