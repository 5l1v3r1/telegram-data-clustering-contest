      <p>Reality TV star <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kylie-jenner">Kylie Jenner</a> and rapper Travis Scott may have gone their separate ways - but it seems the pair are still on good terms.</p>
      <p>Kylie, who shares daughter Stormi with music sensation Travis, turned up in Houston, Texas, to cheer on her ex with their little girl.</p>
      <p>The 22 year old headed to Travis' own Astroworld Music Festival, which he set up in his hometome.</p>
      <p>At one point during the show, Travis announced to his legions of fans that his one year old was watching in the audience.</p>

      <p>He also brought out <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kanye-west">Kanye West</a> for a two song performance - Kanye is Kylie's brother-in-law, married to her half-sister Kim.</p>
      <p>A source told <a href="https://people.com/">People</a> magazine that it's important to the two parents that they remain close for Stormi's sake.</p>
      <p>The source said: "Kylie flew to Houston with a group of friends. She returns to LA this morning.</p>
      <p>"It was important for her to support Travis' festival. They are still very close and often hang out with Stormi."</p>

      <p>The Kylie Cosmetics guru has been in the spotlight even more so than usual recently, amid reports that she and rapper Drake were an item at one point.</p>
      <p>They both deny that they were ever together.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10308363/kylie-jenner-drake-date-free-spirit/">The Sun</a> reported they tried to keep their alleged romance a secret - especially from Kim, considering Drake's former feud with her husband Kanye.</p>
      <p>The publication went on to claim that Kylie wanted something more serious, but that Drake refused to be tied down.</p>
      <p>A source had previously told People: "He and Kylie have been spending time together recently.</p>
      <p>"They've been friends for a long time and Drake is very close to the family."</p>
