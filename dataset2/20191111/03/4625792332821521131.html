      <h1>Piers Morgan hails Donald Trump Jr. as ‘brutally ballsy’ for talking on The View women</h1>

      <p>Piers Morgan gave Donald Trump Jr. a round of applause for his appearance on <i>The View</i> this week, during which the president's son took on criticism and questions from the ladies of the panel.</p>
      <p>"I was fascinated to see how he would get on when he appeared on a show whose stars ... have made no secret of their disdain for the President.," the journalist and broadcaster <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7665429/PIERS-MORGAN-Donald-Trump-Jr-gave-stunning-View-lying-liberal-celebrity-hypocrisy.html">wrote</a> for the Daily Mail. "The answer was … spectacularly. In fact, it was one of the wildest daytime talk show interviews I can ever remember watching."</p>
      <p>He added, "It was also one of the most revealing. For Trump Jr. turned the tables on some of his family's most savage critics, and exposed their searing hypocrisy."</p>
      <p>Morgan pointed to several occasions when Trump flipped the script on the show's co-hosts, including when <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/are-you-questioning-my-character-whoopi-defends-joy-behar-when-trump-jr-says-she-wore-blackface">he confronted</a> Joy Behar about her use of "blackface," pointed out Whoopi Goldberg's past defense of Roman Polansky, and <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/the-view-host-tells-donald-trump-jr-my-law-degree-says-exposing-whistleblower-is-a-crime">took on Sunni Hostin</a> in an argument over whistleblower rights.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the episode featured plenty of <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/the-booing-is-f-ing-us-up-whoopi-goldberg-chastises-the-view-audience-during-don-jr-appearance">booing</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/this-is-not-a-maga-rally-joy-behar-snaps-at-audience-applauding-for-don-trump-jr">cheering</a> from audience members.</p>
      <p>"It took guts for Trump Jr. to go into the lionesses' den," Morgan wrote. "and he got the savaging he expected."</p>
      <p>However, he added that the president's son "gave as good as he got, and in doing so, he also exposed much of the shameless hypocrisy and selective outrage that pervades the liberal celebrity anti-Trump mindset."</p>
      <p>Trump joined the daytime talk show on Thursday alongside girlfriend and former Fox News personality Kimberly Guilfoyle to promote his new book <i>Triggered.</i></p>
