      <h1>Game of Thrones' Emilia Clarke wants to be the first female 007</h1>
      <h2>Emilia has put her name out there to be the first woman to take on the 007 mantle after Daniel Craig calls it a day</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T03:18:10+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 03:18</time> by <a rel="author">Will Twigger, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/will-twigger/</a></address>
      <p>Game of Thrones star <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/emilia-clarke">Emilia Clarke</a> is going from career strength to career strength - and now she fancies her chances in the spy game.</p>
      <p>The Daenerys Targaryen actress has revealed she would love to play the first female 007 after Daniel Craig retires from the role.</p>
      <p>With Daniel set to create a Bond-shaped vacancy when he leaves the role after 13 years, Emilia was asked by <a href="https://www.empireonline.com/">Empire</a> if she'd be keen to take up the gun.</p>
      <p>"Yeah! Of course!" she screamed, "Hell to the yeah! James Bond is one of those franchises where it's never not cool.</p>
      <p>"You could literally make the naffest James Bond in the world and it would still be cool."</p>

      <p>Work's still going on the next entry into the franchise, No Time To Die, set for an April 2020 release.</p>
      <p>Fans were surprised to hear that Daniel had signed on for another film after he made various disparaging comments about working on the franchise during the last film's press tour.</p>
      <p>He most memorably told journalists when asked if he'd be up for a fifth film: "I'd rather slash my wrists."</p>
      <p>There have been rumours floating that British actress Lashana Lynch could be set to take up the mantle - she would be not only the first woman, but the first black person to take the role as well.</p>

      <p>Having stunned comic audiences with her role in Captain Marvel earlier this year - alongside the likes of Brie Larson and Samuel L Jackson - Lashana's potential casting has been met with positivity - by some.</p>
      <p>Others reckon the role should remain firmly in the hands of a white man, including Ab Fab's Joanna Lumley.</p>
      <p>She told <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/10/game-thrones-emilia-clarke-wants-play-first-female-james-bond-hell-yeah-11073270/">Metro</a> : "[Author Ian Fleming] took very special pains to describe James Bond, who was a man, and this was written in the early 50s, who was a British man of a certain height and build and a rather cruel face, a lean build.</p>
      <p>"It seems odd to me that you'd make that a woman."</p>
      <p>She added: "By all means write another character who works for MI6, write a new one , but don't tag on to this lazy business of pretending it's James Bond.</p>

      <p>"Make a different one. It would have to be 008 or somebody else, and make it a woman if you have to. Remember James Bond is a character written by a real writer. You wouldn't make Mr Pickwick into a 23 year old girl."</p>
      <p>Emilia, meanwhile, is starring alongside the hunky Crazy Rich Asians star Henry Golding in Last Christmas.</p>
      <p>The star left hardcore Game of Thrones fans divided with the final season, which saw her character fulfill her family's words "Fire and Blood" as she unleashed her dragon on innocent bystanders.</p>
