      <p>Democratic presidential hopeful and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro on Sunday called for a change in the order of the states for presidential primaries.</p>
      <p>Castro reasoned on MSNBC’s “Kasie DC” that the “country has changed a lot” in the last 50 years and Iowa and New Hampshire are no longer “reflective” of the United States nor the Democratic Party.</p>
      <p>“I actually believe that we do need to change the order of the states, because I don’t believe that we’re the same country we were in 1972,” explained Castro. “That’s when Iowa first held its caucus first [sic]. And by the time we have the next presidential election in 2024, it’ll have been more than 50 years since 1972. Our country has changed a lot in those 50 years. The Democratic Party has changed a lot.”</p>
      <p>He added, “Demographically, it’s not reflective of the United States as a whole, certainly not reflective of the Democratic Party, and I believe that other states should have their chance. So, yes, of course, we need to find other states.”</p>
