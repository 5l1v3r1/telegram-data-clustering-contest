      <h1>Knicks fans bust out 'Fire Dolan!' chant during game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T03:49:23+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 03:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thesportsdaily.com/author/tsd-staff/" target="_blank">TSD Staff</a></address>
      <p>The Knicks are the worst team in the NBA, with a 2-8 record, and a -10.1 points differential per game.</p>
      <p>And, unfortunately for their fan base, despite what the team’s front office says — the Knicks aren’t getting better anytime soon.</p>
      <p>As such, fans are becoming fed up with both the front office and ownership — understandably so.</p>
      <p>There has been a lot of talk urging owner James Dolan to sell the team, and a chant about it even broke out during Sunday’s game against the Cavs at Madison Square Garden.</p>
