      <h1>Laurel Griggs, Broadway Actress, Dies at 13 After Asthma Attack</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T03:47:58+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 03:47</time> by <a rel="author">Mariel Padilla and Neil Vigdor</a></address>
      <p>Laurel Griggs, who enjoyed early acting success in the 2013 Broadway revival of “Cat on a Hot Tin Roof” and the musical adaptation of the Irish film “Once,” died on Tuesday. She was 13.</p>
      <p>Ms. Griggs’s death was confirmed by David Rivlin, her grandfather, who said in an interview on Sunday that the actress had a “massive asthma attack.”</p>
      <p>“Laurel was a child that everybody would dream to have,” Mr. Rivlin said. “She was a brilliant girl, could run a role and never forget a line, and I never heard a complaint. I’m going to miss her.”</p>
      <p>Emergency responders were flagged down around 7:25 p.m. on Tuesday outside an East Harlem residence to help a girl who was having difficulty breathing on the front steps of the building, the New York Police Department said.</p>
      <p>Officers performed CPR on the girl, whose name they did not release, en route to Mount Sinai Hospital, the police said.</p>
      <p>Ms. Griggs died at the hospital, Mr. Rivlin said. Her funeral was held on Friday, according to an <a href="https://www.dignitymemorial.com/obituaries/new-york-ny/laurel-griggs-8917364">obituary posted</a> on the website of Riverside Memorial Chapel.</p>
      <p>“The world lost a real princess who only wanted to make the future happy for all,” Mr. Rivlin said on Facebook. “Acting was just a childhood dream come true and she had big plans for the future.”</p>
      <p>Ms. Griggs’s death stunned members of the theater community, who <a href="https://twitter.com/BroadwayWorld/status/1193292307790995456">posted tributes</a> to her on social media. They described Ms. Griggs as a special talent who was kindhearted as she balanced the rigors of school with her promising acting career.</p>
      <p>She made her Broadway debut at age 6 as Polly in Tennessee Williams’s “Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,” which starred Scarlett Johansson as Maggie. In 2013, Ms. Griggs joined the company of the Tony Award-winning musical “Once” for 17 months, where she played the longest-running Ivanka in the production’s history, according to <a href="http://youngbway.org/2019/11/laurel/?fbclid=IwAR1ltK1ZVO6GVGlJ89G8tkOAzGXIPLQ6kk7s8GeR_ZEsrUAYRDnRGSH83iA#">Young Broadway Actor News</a>, a site for children working in New York theater.</p>
      <p>“Laurel was a brilliant young lady whose impact in the lives of everyone she met went far and beyond her immense talent,” the site said in a post. “Her wisdom and kindness were gifts to the theater community during her time on Earth.”</p>
      <p>Rob Ashford, a Tony Award winner who directed Ms. Griggs in “Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,” said the young actress was a dynamic cast member.</p>
      <p>“Laurel was one of the first children we cast in ‘Cat On A Hot Tin Roof,’” Mr. Ashford said in an email. “She had a wonderful energy and spirit and was loved by the entire company. Such a loss!”</p>
      <p>Ms. Griggs made a few appearances on “Saturday Night Life” as an uncredited cast member, according to the Internet Movie Database. She also appeared in “Café Society,” a romantic comedy starring Steve Carell that Amazon released in 2016, and did voice work for the animated series “Bubble Guppies.”</p>
      <p>Ms. Griggs also wrote and directed a short film about a school shooting called “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c256isGkBrM">This is Not a Drill</a>,” Mr. Rivlin said. It was <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bh5LhviHC0J/">screened at the Tribeca Film Festival</a> last year.</p>
      <p>She did philanthropy for Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS, to which her family directed memorial donations.</p>
      <p>“Whether she was helping with our fund-raising efforts or appearing with other kids from Broadway in a special holiday video, Laurel exuded sweetness and sincerity, as she did onstage in ‘Once’ with a company that adored her<i>,” </i>Tom Viola, the organization’s executive director, said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Ms. Griggs’s asthma was diagnosed at an early age, according to her grandfather, who said she attended the Clinton School, an International Baccalaureate World School on East 15th Street with a strong emphasis on the arts.</p>
      <p>“She took her medication everyday and had some kind of machine for breathing if she needed it,” he said. “She didn’t miss any school. It’s just a destructive disease.”</p>
      <p>Mr. Rivlin, who spent one-on-one time with his granddaughter every week, said Ms. Griggs had big plans outside show business. She was an environmentalist and an activist and probably would have become a lawyer, he added.</p>
      <p>“I think the country is going to miss her, not just Broadway,” Mr. Rivlin said. “God only knows what she could have done with her life.”</p>
