      <p>While roses may be the way into some hearts, a Thai man believes cooked pork is the best way to show someone you love them this Loy Krathong.</p>
      <p>For the Thai Festival of Lights taking place today, Naeak “Eak” Wichapom’s gone viral for creating a float, or <i>krathong</i>, out of vegetables and pork just to see if it could be done.</p>
      <p>“This year, I think my wife will really like this. … She must be bored of bananas and bread. So I decided to prepare <i>moo kra ta </i>(barbecue pork) for my entire family. It’ll feed my mom, my wife and my kid,” Naeak wrote on his <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Darlingboredom/">Bored of My Wife</a> page along with photos of him test-floating – and eating – the pork krathong on Loy Krathong Eve. </p>

      <p>The photos show that rather than the usual foam or bread covered with flowers, his krathong was an elaborate hot pot spread filled with meat, carrots, mushrooms and an array of green veggies. Naeak is shown sticking candles and incense into the krathong for prayer before floating it in a bucket of water in what looks like his backyard.</p>
      <p>After that, he’s seen firing up a hot pot grill and putting the bowl on top. “Delicious” he wrote with a photo of him sampling the edible krathong. </p>

      <p>It wasn’t the first time Naeak has wowed the Thainet with his creativity. Back in February, he went viral for another creative barbecue creation – a meat bouquet he made for his wife on Valentine’s Day.</p>
      <p>“I’ve given her many things over the years we’ve been together, I figured she’d be bored of everything by now. So I wanted to do something weird this year,” said Naeak, whose page of comics about modern love has more than 2 million likes.</p>
      <p>“We love food, what can go wrong?” told <i>Coconuts Bangkok </i>this morning of his inspiration.</p>
