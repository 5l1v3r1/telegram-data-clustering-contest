      <h1>‘Help, dad!’ a hysterical Aliff Aziz shouts during Orchard Road arrest (Video)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T03:25:29+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 03:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Singapore" target="_blank">Coconuts Singapore</a></address>
      <p>The downward spiral of Singaporean singer-actor Aliff Aziz hit a new low yesterday with a drunk chase and tackle down Orchard Road.</p>
      <p>Aliff, 28, was arrested for public nuisance Sunday morning after several police officers had to pin him down beside the main road just outside Orchard Towers following an apparent foot pursuit down the popular shopping belt, which was caught in dramatic footage. </p>
      <p>“Dad! They’re beating me up, dad! … Dad! Help, dad!” Aliff can be heard shouting into his mobile phone in Malay in the clip showing officers struggling to handcuff him. He shouts that the officers should speak to his father on the phone, but the officers decline.  </p>
      <p>The clip, which has been viewed more than 100,000 times and garnered more than 3,000 shares, also showed more officers arriving in police cars to help pin down Aliff, who gained fame a decade ago as a singing contest winner but has become more famous offscreen for his messy personal life.</p>
      <p>In another clip, which looks to have been shot just before and shows Aliff running from officers further down the road near the junction of Cairnhill and Grange roads, whom he apparently managed to escape. </p>

      <p>Police told reporters that Aliff had gotten into a <a href="https://berita.mediacorp.sg/mobilem/hiburan/aliff-aziz-ditangkap-ganggu-ketenteraman-awam-ketika-mabuk-di/4361960.html">drunken brawl</a> with a man on Orchard Road at about 6:40am, and that his breath reeked of alcohol. Aliff was repeatedly told to calm down and stop quarreling but refused to do so, police said.</p>
      <p>Police did not respond to <i>Coconuts Singapore’s </i>phone inquiry as of publication time. </p>
      <p>The other viral clip seeming to show Aliff running away from officers appears to have been captured by a female eyewitness, who was heard in the background explaining what she thought was going on. </p>
      <p>With a finger pointing to the scene, she is heard saying in Malay: “He was finding trouble with this guy, and then with this guy, and then the police caught him.”</p>

He then married Malaysian personality Bella Astillah, they had a child together.</p>
      <p>Their marriage took a bad turn after Aliff was caught cheating on Bella wife with Malaysian co-star Afifah Nasir in 2017, followed by more incidents of infidelity, including one involving actress Oktovia Manrose. </p>
