      <h1>Shiv Sena minister in Modi govt resigns, slams 'falsehood' in Delhi</h1>
      <h2>On November 10, Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari had invited Shiv Sena to inform him if it could form government</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T03:09:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 03:09</time> by <a rel="author">BS Web Team</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/shiv-sena">Shiv Sena </a>leader <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/arvind-sawant">Arvind Sawant </a>on Monday announced his decision to quit the Narendra Modi government, lashing out at the "environment in Delhi" as his party clashed with the BJP.</p>
      <p>Sawant, who handled the heavy industries ministry and was he Sena Sena's lone minister in the Modi Cabinet, announced his resignation on Twitter to announce his decision.</p>
      <p>"The Shiv Sena's stand is of truth. Why should I stay in atmosphere of falsehood in Delhi? I am resigning as Union minister and will speak at a press conference in Delhi at 11 am," Sawant tweeted, a day after Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari invited his party to stake claim to form government in the state.</p>

      <p>He said before the Lok Sabha polls, a formula was worked out about sharing of power and seat. Both the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/shiv-sena">Shiv Sena </a>and the BJP agreed to it.</p>
      <p>"But now, it is shocking that the decision arrived at is being denied and the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/shiv-sena">Shiv Sena </a>is being projected as not speaking truth.</p>
      <p>This is shocking. This is a blot on the state's pride. The BJP has parted ways by crossing limits of falsehood," he said in another tweet.</p>
      <p>Hours after the BJP declined to form government in Maharashtra on Sunday, the governor asked the Shiv Sena to "indicate the willingness and ability" of the party to stake claim.</p>
      <p>The Sena, which is the second-largest party in the 288-member House with 56 MLAs after the BJP (105), has time till 7.30 pm on Monday to stake claim to form government.</p>
      <p>While the Sena has been making efforts to reach out to the NCP and the Congress, the Sharad Pawar-led party on Sunday said the Sena will have to walk out of the NDA first. (With inputs from PTI)</p>
