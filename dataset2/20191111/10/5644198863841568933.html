      <p>REUTERS: Bernard J. Tyson, chairman and chief executive officer of not-for-profit health insurer Kaiser Permanente, died unexpectedly in his sleep on Sunday, aged 60, the company said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Tyson, who held the top job since 2013, was Oakland, California-based Kaiser Permanente's first black chief executive and a strong proponent for affordable and accessible healthcare.</p>

      <p>The company did not give a cause of death. A company spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
      <p>A day earlier on Saturday, the San Francisco native took to Twitter to post about "high-tech and high-touch" healthcare.</p>
      <p>Tyson was described by colleagues in a company statement as "an outstanding leader, visionary and champion for high-quality, affordable health care for all Americans."</p>
      <p>In response to Tyson's death, the National Union of Healthcare Workers postponed a five-day strike by 4,000 mental health professional that had been set to begin on Monday at more than 100 Kaiser clinics across California.</p>
      <p>"Our members dedicate their lives to helping people through tragedy and trauma, and they understood that a strike would not be appropriate during this period of mourning and reflection," union president Sal Rosselli said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The union, locked in a contract dispute its leaders say centers on demands for improved retirement and health benefits for Kaiser's mental health clinicians, has yet to reschedule the strike, he said.</p>
      <p>Kaiser's annual operating revenue as of June was nearly US$80 billion, up from about US$53 billion in 2013 when Tyson took over as CEO, according to the company's website.</p>
      <p>The company, which serves more than 12 million people across the United States and was founded in 1945, named Gregory Adams, executive vice president, as interim chairman and CEO.</p>
