        <b>It has been a far from a simple season for <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/renault-f1-team">Renault</a> as they face a battle to hold onto fifth in the Constructors' Championship but Alain Prost is hopeful of showing some fight to keep pushing <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mclaren">McLaren</a>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Having signed <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/daniel-ricciardo">Daniel Ricciardo</a> from <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/red-bull-racing">Red Bull</a>, expectations were high a Renault ahead of the 2019 season but they've fallen backwards behind McLaren in the battle for midfield supremacy.</p>
      <p>With <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/Racing-point">Racing Point</a> and <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/scuderia-toro-rosso">Toro Rosso</a> on the tails of Renault, the French team will want to see out their current fifth place in the Constructors' Championship with only two races to go. Prost is remaining focused on the job at hand but he is still targeting putting more pressure on McLaren.</p>

      <p><i>"It’s not over but we are more confident for sure,"</i> Prost told <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/prost-renault-fifth-championship-2019/4594990/">Motorsport.com</a>.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"After what happened when we lost the points in Japan – it makes quite a big difference, because it’s not only losing points, it gave more points to the others. So we really deserved to be where we are.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"At least at the end of the season we need to show something, because it’s good for the morale of the people. We have had a very tough season.</i>
