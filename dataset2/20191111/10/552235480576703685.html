      <h1>Martin Boyle's Australia role revealed as Hibs star continues injury comeback</h1>
      <h2>The winger is only back from injury but returns to the Socceroos squad.</h2>

      <p>Graham Arnold insists Australia won't overplay Martin Boyle during Australia's <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/world-cup-2022">World Cup</a> showdown in Jordan.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a> winger is back in the Australia squad for the first time since suffering a knee injury last January.</p>
      <p>Easter Road supporters are concerned about the decision to call him up after he was injured on international duty before suffering a set back in July.</p>
      <p>He's only made three sub appearances for Hibs since battling back to fitness from his latest setback, but he's viewed as hugely important to Australia, who have insisted he travel with them for Thursday's game in Amman.</p>

      <p>Boyle scored twice on his first start for Australia in a 3-0 win against Lebanon in November lasy year. And Arnold is delighted the 26-year-old is back on international duty.</p>
      <p>He said: "It’s fantastic to have Martin back. He has so much energy, on the pitch but also in the camp. He’s a great guy and to have him back finally is a great sign for us.</p>
      <p>"He’s come off the bench recently for Hibs for 15 to 20 minutes. I’ve had a good conversation with him and that’ll probably be his role for us if required.</p>
      <p>"He’s clear on that as well so we’re looking forward to having him back in camp again."</p>
      <p>Australia also recalled <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic's</a> <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/tom-rogic">Tom Rogic</a> for what would be his first game for his country since January in Australia's unsuccessful  Asian Cup campaign.</p>
