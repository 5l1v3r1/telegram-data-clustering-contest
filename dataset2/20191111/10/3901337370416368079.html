      <h1>Middendorp: Why Shouldn’t I Rate Him?</h1>

      <p>Ernst Middendorp says he knew six years ago already that attacker Dumsani Zuma was a player with great potential.</p>
      <p>The two, now both at Kaizer Chiefs, met for the first time at Bloemfontein Celtic during the German mentor’s brief stint at the Free State-based outfit, with Zuma still only a teenager who’s just celebrated his 18<sup>th</sup> birthday.</p>

      <p>Zuma joined Amakhosi two years ago while Steve Komphela was head coach and has only recently just caught the eye and last week – in a midweek Absa Premiership clash away to Chippa United – he was the Glamour Boys’ two-goal hero. </p>
      <p>“Why shouldn’t I rate him? He came in 2013 to Bloemfontein and he was at another club playing in front of other coaches who were looking at his abilities, but was not taken,” Middendorp said after he’d handed Zuma his first league start in the 2-0 win against Chippa at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium.  </p>
      <p>“At that time somebody phoned me and asked me if I wanted to have a look at a player with a lot of potential. He trained one hour and signed a contract. So, why should I change my mind when I saw it in 2013 already? He was a pleasure from the first second to the last, and I think now he is better and is surrounded with a more professional structure. He is challenged a little bit more – it’s good for him and his progress. He is still young.”</p>
