      <h1>Why it is wrong to troll Priyanka Chopra for wearing pollution mask</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T10:04:40+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 10:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-TrollSlayer-479252078.cms" target="_blank">TrollSlayer</a></address>
      <p>NEW DELHI. Bollywood actor <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Priyanka-Chopra">Priyanka Chopra</a> Jonas recently took to <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Instagram">Instagram</a> to share a picture of herself from Delhi with a pollution mask on. However, the same didn’t go down well with some of her followers, who <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/priyanka-chopra-gets-trolled-for-her-mask-pic-social-media-says-yeah-that-cigarette-you-smoke-wont-kill-you/articleshow/71885864.cms">trolled</a> her for being a smoker and yet complaining about pollution.</p>

        <i>Here’s why these trolls are missing the larger problem:</i>
      </p>
      <p>It takes only a basic level of intellect to understand that smoking is a personal choice but being made to breathe polluted air is not. And polluted air doesn't just affect smokers, even non-smokers are not spared.</p>
      <p>Trolls attacking Chopra sound like smoking is a criminal offense and anyone who smokes loses rights to take care of her health. Chopra is an influential voice, who should in fact be thanked and commended for highlighting the problem of pollution faced by many in India.</p>
      <p>She made that post to raise awareness about an issue that affects millions. She, unlike most of these trolls, can afford expensive air <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/purifiers">purifiers</a> and stays out of India most of the time. Therefore, it is funny to see trolls targeting a celebrity who stood up for them.</p>
      <p>For these trolls, moral policing a celebrity for her lifestyle choices seems to be more important than the fact she is subtly urging the powers that be to do something about the pollution menace affecting millions in India. In a way trolls are saying that if one smokes, she becomes immune to pollution and thus should not wear any masks.</p>
      <p>Trolls would do good to focus on things they can do to reduce pollution than failed attempts at gaslighting celebrities by calling them “hypocrites”. At the end of the day, like everyone, even Priyanka is responsible for her own health.</p>
      <p>Mocking her for the fact that she suffers from <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/asthma">asthma</a> and criticizing her would do these trolls no good. She is well within her rights to smoke and also at the same time wear masks to save herself from pollution. If they really wish to attack or target anyone, it should be the politicians they should be aiming their guns at, for failing to do anything about rising pollution. Let’s not be in denial about the bigger problem in hand.</p>
      <p>One must understand that even people who do not smoke are being forced to inhale air which is equivalent to god knows how many cigarettes. The authorities have in a way ensured that we all are smokers and not just Priyanka. So speak up or at least don’t criticize those who speak up on your behalf!</p>
