      <h1>Russia's F-35 Killer: Report Claims S-500 Air Defense System Was 'Tested' in Syria</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T10:55:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 10:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://nationalinterest.org/" target="_blank">Mark Episkopos</a></address>
      <p>Russia’s next-generation air and missile defense system is on the verge of entering serial production, according to the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov. “On time, they are putting a new system into operation-- the S-500,” Borisov told Russian news outlet <a href="https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/4154217"><i>Interfaks</i></a> earlier today.</p>
      <p>Borisov is the latest top-tier Russian official to tease the readiness of the S-500 over the course of this year, joined by the likes of Aerospace Forces Deputy Commander Lieutenant General <a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/f-35-killer-russias-s-500-air-defense-system-almost-ready-55702">Yuri Grekhov </a>and Rostec CEO<a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/get-ready-nato-russias-s-500-coming-soon-battlefield-near-you-66967"> Sergei Chemezov</a>. The Russian government and defense industry continues to reaffirm that the S-500 will be delivered within the timetable set by Russia’s 2027 state armament program, which established that the first, serially-produced S-500 will enter service in 2020.</p>
      <p>A defense industry source told Russian news outlet <a href="https://iz.ru/927757/2019-10-02/voennye-utochnili-dannye-ob-ispytaniiakh-elementov-pvo-v-sirii"><i>Izvestia</i></a> last month that the S-500 recently underwent field testing in Syria, where the Russian Aerospace Forces continue to maintain a significant presence. The Russian Defense Ministry unequivocally denied that the S-500 was ever on Syrian soil in an October 2 statement, claiming that “there was no need” for further testing.</p>
