      <h1>Gary Neville's verdict on Arsenal and Unai Emery's current situation after Leicester loss</h1>
      <h2>Sky Sports pundit Neville has compared Arsenal to former club Manchester United - admitting the Gunners in their current state are a "frustration"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T10:13:15+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 10:13</time> by <a rel="author">James Whaling, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/james-whaling/</a></address>
      <p>Gary Neville insists that Unai Emery is a "great coach" - despite the mounting pressure on the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> boss.</p>
      <p>A large section of the Gunners fanbase has turned on Emery after a run of results which has seen them fail to record a Premier League victory since October 6.</p>
      <p>Neville has compared Arsenal's current malaise to that at his former club <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> since the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson.</p>
      <p>Emery is the first manager to take over at the Emirates since Arsene Wenger left after a 22-year spell in charge of the Gunners.</p>
      <p>Arsenal are already eight points off the top-four pace following a 2-0 defeat to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> at the King Power Stadium - and Neville describes the club as a "frustration".</p>

      <p>“The fans are getting very impatient at this time," he said on Sky Sports' Gary Neville podcast.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think anyone was surprised that Leicester went and won that game as they did. It doesn’t shock you, it doesn’t surprise you what happens with Arsenal.</p>
      <p>“Arsenal are what they are. They’re a frustration.</p>
      <p>"Unai Emery is getting put under big pressure - I do know that Unai Emery is a great coach.</p>

      <p>"But post-Arsene Wenger was never going to be easy. I said before, ‘be careful what you wish for, it’s not going to be easy’. People will say Arsene Wenger should have been let go earlier.</p>
      <p>“Great coaches will come into Arsenal and find it difficult to change culturally there what’s gone on and what’s happened.</p>
      <p>“I’ve seen it at Manchester United since Sir Alex Ferguson left. These two men were institutions at their football club, they were more than coaches.</p>
      <p>"They were CEOs, they were the leader of the club in every single way. Everybody looked up to them, they were the only boss at each of the clubs.</p>
      <p>“And it’s going to take time. So there is going to need to be some patience shown at Arsenal - as there has been at Manchester United.</p>
      <p>“Big clubs, huge clubs. But they’ll get back. The cycle will turn."</p>
