      <p>People suffered injures before the official opening of the 2019 Astroworld music festival, when they demolished the barricadesÂ and raced to be the first to appear in the stands at NRG stadium in Houston, Texas.</p>
      <p>Rapper Travis Scott, the organiser of the festival, himself posted a video on Instagram of fans pushing down barricades and running toward the NRG Park.</p>

      <p>Tickets for the festival were sold out a few weeks ago, although the main participants became known only on 8 November. Many fans spent the night near the stadium to be the first to enter and find better spots.</p>
