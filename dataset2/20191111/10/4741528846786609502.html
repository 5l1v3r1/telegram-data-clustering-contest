      <p>“<i>Skills make you rich, not theories</i>.” It takes more than vision, planning and branding to become a successful entrepreneur. The skillset palette of the successful business owner is one that is wide and varied, with a number of abilities that take time and commitment to cultivate. You can’t just want your company to be great, you have to make it great, but that takes a bit of internal work first, and it takes developing the skills you need to thrive in a fast-paced world. Success demands more than hard work, resilience, and expertise in your field. In order to succeed, you need to understand and become proficient in a set of fundamental business skills.</p>
      <h3>Delegation skills</h3>
      <p><b>Delegation involves assigning responsibility</b> to other people for the completion of work. The ideal position that you want to obtain is one where your staff carry out all the routine activities of your business. Effective delegation involves achieving the correct balance between effective controls and allowing people to complete their jobs effectively. The key element is knowing how to make your business work, with as little input from you as possible.</p>
      <h3>Communication skills</h3>
      <p><b>Communication is an important part of life</b>, though it is often taken for granted. When you think about it, almost everything you do requires improved communications. To be effective in business, you have to communicate well. When you hire a new employee, good communication skills help you select the right person. When you communicate with your various stakeholders, you need to be clear about your expectations and sensitive when dealing with problems. The key is to know how to effectively communicate your vision with passion and conviction.</p>

      <h3>Negotiation skills</h3>
      <p><b>Almost everyone negotiates informally</b> on a daily basis, without even being aware of it. Formal negotiation is a skill that can be learned through experience and practice. People who negotiate frequently tend to be more skilled at it than people who have not participated in many formal/informal negotiations. Experienced people are more likely to know what to say, when or when not to say it, or make concessions. The key is to know how to develop a win-win approach in negotiations with all parties, while at the same time keeping in mind that you also want to obtain the most favourable outcome possible for yourself.</p>
      <h3>Strategic planning</h3>
      <p><b>Strategic planning</b> is a very important business activity. It is a process of defining your company’s strategy or direction and making decisions on allocations of resources of capital and people. The key is knowing how to project your company’s future performance, within a three-to-five-year framework or more, supported by your well-defined business plan.</p>
