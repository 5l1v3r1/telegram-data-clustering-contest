        <b>Bengaluru FC head coach Carles Cuadrat has expressed his happiness and hailed his players for the commitment from the first minute after their first win of the season against Chennaiyin FC on Sunday. Moreover, the Spaniard revealed why striker Manuel Onwu was left out in the playing eleven.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/bengaluru_fc">Bengaluru FC</a> thrashed <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/chennaiyin_fc">Chennaiyin FC</a> 3-0 for their first win of the season at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium on Sunday in Bengaluru. Australian Erik Paartalu, who was returning from an injury, scored the first goal while captain <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/player/sunil_chhetri">Sunil Chhetri</a> scored his first goal of the season and second of the game. Substitute Semboi <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/player/haokip">Haokip</a> found the final goal for Bengaluru in the late minutes of the second half.</p>
      <p>And Bengaluru's Spanish head coach Carles Cuadrat couldn't be any happier as he was seen hailing the players for their attacking football from the first minute.</p>
      <p>“We played as the team which was going for the victory from the first minute. So, I’m very happy with the boys and with the score. It was a magical night in Kanteerava. I’m very happy for everybody who loves Bengaluru.” said Carles Cudrat at the post-match conference, ISL website reported.</p>
      <p>Australian Erik Paiartalu returned to the Blues starting eleven. The midfielder who missed the previous matches for the champions opened the goal-scoring tally by a brilliant header in the 14th minute and the coach expressed his excitement for the same.</p>
      <p>“Paartalu is an impactful player because of his attitude and his heading ability. I’m very happy he scored on his return because he is a very hard worker. He has not played for almost nine months because of his injury last season, so it’s great that he is with us again.” said Cuadrat.</p>
      <p>Before the Chennaiyin fixture, Bengaluru FC had three draws and had only scored a goal, courtesy of <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/player/udanta_singh">Udanta Singh</a> against <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/fc_goa">FC Goa</a>. Moreover, the southern side was struggling in the attacking third in the absence of their star striker Miku who left the club last summer. BFC would be up against a star-studded side next match and the coach couldn't contain his excitement.</p>
      <p>“Its more about the dynamic of the team. We had to break the goal drought and we did. Even Chennaiyin are goalless this season. They had some chances and someday they will score. This happens in every league. Every game is different. Because of the opponent we make a different plan for the game. Until now, if you pay attention to the details, we were quite different in the four games. So, that’s what we have to keep in mind because the next game (against Kerala Blasters) is a tough one. They always come here and put us in trouble so let’s see what we do.” the Spanish coach added.</p>
      <p>The former assistant under <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/player/albert_roca">Albert Roca</a> also revealed why new signing Manuel Onwu was left out in the starting eleven. “It was not a perfect performance for sure. We are still starting the season. it was the first game for Erik as well as the first game that we played with three attackers from India because Manu (Manuel Onwu) had a little problem. So, we have to work and try to give our best. We must improve no question about that,” Carles Cuadrat added.</p>
      <p>Cuadrat used Ashique Kuruniyan in different positions this season and spoke about it. “I told from the first day that I would use Ashique Kuruniyan in different positions. This is one thing about my team… I can put my players in different positions. I’ve done this with Sunil (Chhetri), (Harmanjot Singh) Khabra, (Rahul) Bheke. It’s great to have a lot of Indian players with tactical knowledge and playing in different positions. It’s a good thing for me.” Cuadrat concluded.</p>
