      <p>Yesterday, The Jomo Kenyatta University Students’ Association through a memo urged the students to assemble for a peaceful demonstration over their safety. “Due to rampant cases of insecurity in Juja and total failure of the relevant authorities to protect comrades and their properties…  We call the students to show up and evoke a fundamental right of expression through a peaceful demonstration… ” read JKUSA’s memo. The students heeded to the call and gathered outside Gate B of the institution. Not long after the demonstrations commenced, police showed up and used teargas to scatter the crowd. Videos making rounds online show some students engaging in running battles with the police.</p>

      <p>Shortly after the demonstrations were quelled, the varsity’s management closed the institution until further notice. There have been cases of robbery with violence at the university premises. As a result, some students have been stubbed and others killed by thugs. Some of the students have accused bodaboda riders of orchestrating the robberies that have left the University’s security in limbo.</p>
