      <p>"I can't imagine what it's like to miss so much as they change so quickly," Harry said before revealing Archie is crawling, while Meghan told a little girl who handed her a rose that Archie's got two little teeth.</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://www.forces.net/news/prince-harry-and-meghan-surprise-army-wives"><b>Forces Network</b></a>, Prince Harry also seemed interested in what the family dynamics are like after introducing a second child.</p>
      <p>Army wife Susie Stringfellow told the military website, "Harry was really quite interested in how things were with second children as well... We were trying to encourage him to have a second baby."</p>
      <p>Well, chances are, they probably will.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the year, Prince Harry also revealed to Dr Jane Goodall in their conversation for Meghan's Forces For Change Vogue issue <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/Gossip/Royal-News/prince-harry-and-dr-jane-goodall-talk-climate-change-the-world-as-they-see-it-and-how-many-siblings-baby-archie-will-be-getting-20190731-2"><b>how many siblings he's planning on giving Archie</b></a>. Revealing that the climate crisis helped the couple make the decision together, he said, "Two, maximum."  </p>
