      <h1>Arsenal captaincy vote suggested by club's psychologist - not Unai Emery</h1>
      <h2>Emery looks as vulnerable as Arsenal’s defence right now and, having struggled at Paris Saint-Germain, this will surely be his last crack at managing a top club</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T10:47:06+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 10:47</time> by <a rel="author">John Cross, https://www.facebook.com/johncrossmirror/</a></address>
      <p>Under-fire Arsenal manager Unai Emery has been ridiculed for holding a dressing room vote over who should get the captaincy.</p>
      <p>But it has now emerged that it was not his idea - and yet he has paid a heavy price for it.</p>
      <p>It was dreamed up by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> ’s psychologist David Priestley to try and share leadership duties.</p>
      <p>The captaincy saga has caused much debate this season after Granit Xhaka was axed following his x-rated outburst at Arsenal fans, with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang recently being appointed as the new permanent skipper.</p>
      <p>It was Priestley who last season convinced Emery it was a good idea to share the rabble-rousing “team huddle” duties before each game by getting different members of staff to do it.</p>

      <p>Ameesh Manek, who is primarily in charge of organising first-team travel, did the pre-match ritual before the shock defeat to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> in April which put them on a run of three losses which cost them a place in the top four last season.</p>
      <p>Emery looks as vulnerable as Arsenal’s defence right now and, having struggled at Paris Saint-Germain, this will surely be his last crack at managing a top club.</p>
      <p>Spaniard Emery, who won three back-to-back Europa League titles with Sevilla, has struggled to manage big names, his team lacks identity while the players look as if they are struggling with his instructions and tactics.</p>
      <p>Emery ostracised Mesut Ozil and then brought him back, plays Lucas Torreira out of position and has struggled to get the best out of £72m record signing Nicolas Pepe.</p>

      <p>His poor English does not help and his regular opening gambit - “good ebening” - causes him to be mocked behind his back by Arsenal players who are rapidly losing faith and confidence in his methods.</p>
      <p>The manager's misery was compounded over the weekend when <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> eased to a comfortable 2-0 win over the Gunners at the King Power.</p>
      <p>The beleaguered Spaniard has defended his team time and again and has asked for patience as the international fixtures promise to give him a little respite from growing criticism.</p>
      <p>"For me, as a coach, it's about continuing stronger and improving with our players," he said.</p>

      <p>"I am speaking with the club to stay calm and to stay patient to improve and recover some confidence with some circumstances.</p>
      <p>"We are receiving criticism but I know that's my job. I've had lots of moments like that but I've recovered by working to get confidence, being together with the club and players.</p>
      <p>"I accept all (of the criticism). I accept the applause and I accept it when they criticise us. I know when we win, they are going to be happy and when we lose, they are going to be sad. It's normal.</p>
      <p>"We need to stay calm and also keep improving things. Today we got one step ahead by being together and being strong defensively. But we lost because we were playing a very strong team in a good moment."</p>
