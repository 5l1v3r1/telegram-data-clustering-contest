      <h1>Bonginkosi Madikizela pulls out of DA leadership race</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T10:27:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 10:27</time> by <a rel="author">Lizeka Tandwa</a></address>
      <p>DA Western Cape leader Bonginkosi Madikizela has withdrawn from the race for interim federal leader of the party.</p>
      <p>The DA's presiding officer, Désirée Van Der Walt, confirmed this to News24 on Monday. </p>
      <p>"We have two candidates remaining for the position. Bongi has pulled out," she said. </p>
      <p>Madikizela confirmed his resignation to News24 saying he was too busy with by-elections in the Western Cape to contest for the top position. </p>
      <p>"After a number of considerations and speaking to some leaders, I decided its best for me to withdraw. Leaders felt there was still a lot to be done in my own province. If there is enough reason for me to consider becoming a national leader, maybe I should do it for May next year," he told News24. </p>
      <p>This leaves current parliamentary leader John Steenhuisen and newly-elected chairperson of the members of provincial legislature network, Makashule Gana, in the race. </p>
