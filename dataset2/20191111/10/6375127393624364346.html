      <h3>DIMPLES Romana joined showbiz when she was only 12 after she was discovered by Vera Isberto in a mall. ABS-CBN then launched her as part of Star Circle Batch 4 in 1997 that included Jericho Rosales, Kristine Hermosa and Dominic Ochoa. She was so pretty a lot of writers predicted she’ll quickly gain full stardom, but she got married early and so she never really achieved leading lady status.  </h3>
      <p>Now, she’s turning 35 on November 13 and proves that you cannot really put a good talent down. Through the years, she is able to prove that she’s a good actress playing character and contravida roles and now, she has achieved popularity in her role as Daniella Mondragon aka Dani Girl in the afternoon soap, “Kadenang Ginto” where she has launched a thousand memes showing her traveling to various places.</p>
      <p>It is for this reason that the local beauty brand Skin Magical got her as their endorser and she was formally launched last Friday. Their partnership actually started at “Kadenang Ginto” where the product’s Gandang Palaban collection was initially introduced</p>
      <p>Skin Magical COO Ghie Pangilinan says they got Dimples as “Kadenang Ginto” is a toprater and they know she can help push their products that promote women empowerment. Skin Magical is a family business started by Ghie and her OFW-seaman husband Jerry in Morong, Rizal. After Dimples used their products in “Kadenang Ginto”, their orders more than doubled and they can now hardly cope with the backlog of orders.</p>
      <p>“I’m very proud to be the endorser of Skin Magical and I know for a fact that it works,” Dimples says. “As an actress, we have to take good care of our looks kasi yan ang unang tinitingnan ng tao and we have to good clear skin. My own set has a peeling effect that helps to reveal smoother and more radiant skin.’’</p>
      <p>What does their campaign Gandang Palaban mean? “Ito yung kahit ano nang ibato sa ‘yo na hindi maganda, mga paninira, mga trials and tribulations sa buhay, bumabangon ka pa rin. Pero kapag bumangon ‘yung gandang palaban, hindi lang basta bumangon ka kundi bumangon kang maganda ka. Ang maganda pa, very affordable bawat set namin, only P250.”</p>
      <p>Dimples is busy not only with “Kadenang Ginto” but also with movies. She has completed two new films: “Block Z”, a zombie movie, and the Metro Manila Filmfest entry “The Mall the Merrier”. “Security guard akong lumalaban sa zombies in ‘Block Z’ so nag-action ako diyan and in ‘The Mall’, contravida ako kina Vice Ganda and Anne Curtis. And in January, I will start a new movie with Maricel Soriano. So exciting, di ba? Tuluy-tuloy ang dating ng blessings so career ko at sa family life ko, wala akong marereklamo as I’m so happy with my husband and our two kids who are now, 16 and 4 years old.”</p>
      <p>Dimples is also busy helping out her good friend Angel Locsin for her coming wedding with producer Neil Arce. She’s a personal witness to their love story. “I’m preparing to give her a bachelorette party. Pero hindi lang ito for women only kasi marami ring male friends si Angel kaya kasama rito ang mga kaibigan naming lalaki para mas masaya.”</p>
