      <h1>Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Sees Biggest 2019 Drop as Hash Rate Spikes</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T10:32:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 10:32</time> by <a rel="author">William Suberg</a></address>
      <p>Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) mining difficulty adjusted downwards more than at any time since its 2018 price low on Nov. 8, data shows. </p>
      <p>As noted by entrepreneur and cryptocurrency commentator <a href="https://twitter.com/alistairmilne/status/1193795211031388162">Alistair Milne</a> on Monday, difficulty fell by around 7% after the network’s latest readjustment. </p>
      <h3>Difficulty reveals Bitcoin network maneuvering</h3>
      <p>Mining difficulty refers to the effort required for miners to solve the equations necessary to validate transactions on the Bitcoin network. A higher difficulty implies competition for block rewards is higher, while drops incentivize more participation.</p>
      <p>The mechanism functions as a self-stabilizing device for Bitcoin, ensuring network security is sufficient even when price or network activity drops significantly. </p>

      </p>
      <p>From its recent bottom of 5.1 trillion in December 2018, when BTC/USD traded at $3,100, the difficulty has <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-miners-uber-bullish-as-difficulty-set-for-60-quarterly-growth">increased incrementally</a> throughout 2019. In late October, the metric reached an all-time high of 13.7 trillion and has now corrected to 12.7 trillion, data from monitoring resource Blockchain shows.</p>
      <p>“Seems to confirm the cost of mining (on average) is ~$8000,” Milne summarized. </p>
      <h3>Hash rate retakes 100 billion hashes per second</h3>
      <p>At the same time, Bitcoin’s network hash rate saw renewed bullish upside on Monday, having similarly seen a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-hash-rate-record-highs-shows-miners-are-long-term-bullish">period of contraction</a> in recent weeks. </p>
      <p>At press time, hash rate, which is an estimation of how much computing power is dedicated to validating transactions, had passed 100 quintillion hashes per second once again.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The move follows news that Argo Blockchain, a major Bitcoin mining provider, <a href="https://www.sharecast.com/news/news-and-announcements/argo-blockchain-brings-500-new-mining-machines-online--7114499.html">brought 500 new Antminer S17 rigs</a> from mining giant <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitmain">Bitmain</a> online over the past week. </p>
      <p>The United Kingdom-based firm now has around 7,000 miners, and by the end of Q1 2020 plans to increase the total to 17,000. </p>
      <p>As Cointelegraph reported, mining companies overall remain buoyant about the future profitability of the sector. Canaan Creative, another significant player, is reportedly set to undergo a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-miner-canaan-creatives-2019-revenue-nears-100m-ahead-of-ipo">$400 million</a> initial public offering, or <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ipo">IPO</a>, this month. </p>
      <p>At the same time, Bitmain is going ahead with the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitmain-launches-worlds-largest-crypto-mining-facility-in-texas">expansion</a> of a Texas mining farm which officials say could ultimately become the largest in the world.</p>
