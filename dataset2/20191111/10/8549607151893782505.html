      <h4>ETH/USD</h4>
      <p>The <a href="http://ethereum.org/">Ethereum</a> token ETH continued to slide on Sunday, November 3 and stopped at 181.6 losing 1.5 percent on a weekly basis.</p>
      <p>The ETH/USD pair started trading on the first day of the new week by successfully rebounding from the $180 support level. It added 3.3 percent to its value and climbed up to $186. The coin peaked at $189, one step shy of the important zone around $190.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, ETH was quite volatile. We saw it moving in the wide-area between $182 – $193, closing at $188 with a small increase compared to the previous day.</p>
      <p>Bulls were already eyeing $190 as their next target and managed to reach it during the mid-week session on November 6. ETH formed a third consecutive green candle on the daily chart and moved up to $191.</p>
      <p>On Thursday however, it was the bears’ turn. The coin dropped to $186 while erasing 2.6 percent as it was unable to hold above $190 for too long.</p>
      <p>The last day of the workweek came with further decrease, this time to $183. The ETH was trading as low as $180 during the day session.</p>
      <p>The ether was trading in the $180-$190 range since October 26 as both sides were unable to establish a trend.</p>
      <p>It moved up to $185 during the first day of the weekend and on Sunday, November 10 it followed the general crypto market trend and drew a big green candle to $189.</p>

      <p>It started trading on Monday by forming a solid green candle. The coin moved all the way up to $0.299 while gaining 3.1 percent.</p>
      <p>The move was followed by another winning session on Tuesday. In a highly volatile session, during which it was trading in the $0.295-$0.305 area, the “ripple” successfully broke above the $0.30 support level and closed at $0.301.</p>
      <p>The mid-week session on November 6 was no different and the XRP/USD pair drew its third consecutive green candle on the daily chart stopping at $0.31. It added another 2.9 percent.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, bulls were once again rejected at the local high around the $0.31- $0.315 zone. This level was reached on September 18 and it’s the highest point for bulls since then.</p>
      <p>On Thursday we saw XRP erasing 6.4 percent and dropping all the way down to $029. Bears were even able to push the price to $0.274 during intraday.</p>
      <p>The freefall continued on the last day of the workweek and XRP fell to a monthly low of $0.274.</p>
      <p>The weekend of November 9-10 started positively for buyers as they found some room to breath and regained positions around $0.279.</p>
