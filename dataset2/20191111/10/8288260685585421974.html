      <p>A star of popular ITV1 show The Chase has branded Piers Morgan a word he will no doubt shudder at: "Snowflake."</p>
      <p>Piers is a presenter of Good Morning Britain and routinely makes headlines with his controversial opinions.</p>
      <p>Regularly involved in explosive debates and rows on GMB, Piers is a controversial former newspaper editor.</p>
      <p>And he was today branded a ‘snowflake’ by The Chase's Mark Labbett, aka The Beast.</p>
      <p>While appearing on The Chase, Piers managed to get three correct answers on the show, and then took the lower offer of £1000.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, co-host Susanna Reid bagged an incredible £80,000 on the show.</p>
      <p>Mark joked: “I’m heartbroken.</p>
      <p>“You’ve moulded yourself as the epitome of English manliness for years.</p>
      <p>“You deal with princes and presidents.</p>
      <p>“And then you absolutely crack like the snowflake you are!”</p>

      <p>The GMB stars failed to defeat The Beast, who caught Piers, Susanna and Kate in the final round with 37 seconds to spare.</p>
      <p>Viewers of the popular show were outraged with Piers’ performance, after the host slammed Richard Madeley for taking the lower offer.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>One said: “Piers Morgan taking the lower offer on The Chase has cemented my hatred towards him. Colossal nonce.”</p>
      <p>Another said: “So Piers moaned at Richard for going low and he’s gone low himself #numpty.”</p>
      <p>And one viewer who had been on the show himself said: “At peace that I scored higher than Piers Morgan in the cash builder round of The Chase and I didn’t take the lower offer.”</p>
