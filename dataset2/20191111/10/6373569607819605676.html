      <h1>Watch Plymouth Argyle goalkeeper Mike Cooper excel against Everton in Premier League Cup tie</h1>
      <h2>The 20-year-old was in outstanding form as the Pilgrims drew 1-1 away to cup holders Everton</h2>

      <p>Goalkeeper Mike Cooper was in outstanding form as Plymouth Argyle battled out a 1-1 draw away to Everton in the Premier League Cup on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old made a number of superb saves to frustrate cup holders Everton in the Group B game, which was played at Southport FC.</p>
      <p>Although designated as an under-23s’ competition, clubs are allowed to play a maximum of three over-age outfield players.</p>
      <p>Argyle made the most of that opportunity by including 31-year-old attacking duo Billy Clarke and Ryan Taylor in their team.</p>

      <p>Clarke had played as a 76th minute substitute for Argyle in their 1-0 FA Cup first round win at Bolton Wanderers the previous afternoon.</p>
      <p>Striker Dom Telford also continued his comeback from a hamstring injury by playing for almost an hour against Everton.</p>
      <p>Telford had come off the bench in the closing seconds of the FA Cup triumph at Bolton for his first match in seven weeks.</p>
      <p>Cooper and Taylor had been unused substitutes at the University of Bolton Stadium.</p>
      <p>So too was midfielder Adam Randell, who captained Argyle against an Everton side, whose most high profile player was Senegal international Oumar Niasse.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old was signed by Everton for £13.5 million from Russian side Lokomotiv Moscow in 2016.</p>
      <p>Niasse has not played any first team football for the Goodison Park club this season.</p>

      <p>However, he did score both goals for Everton Under-21s when they drew 2-2 at Crewe Alexandra in the EFL Trophy last week.</p>
      <p>Niasse was among the Everton players to be denied by the excellent goalkeeping of Cooper.</p>
      <p>The young Argyle shot-stopper had put in an impressive display in the 1-0 EFL Trophy defeat by Chelsea Under-21s at Home Park on October 29.</p>
      <p>He built on that performance with an even better showing against Everton.</p>
      <p>With Argyle manager Ryan Lowe and assistant boss Steven Schumacher watching on, Cooper was on the top of his game.</p>
      <p>He displayed tremendous athleticism to make saves of all descriptions and it will have done his confidence, as well as his reputation, a lot of good.</p>
      <p>Everton took the lead in the 15th minute when an attempted shot towards goal from Niasse was redirected into the net past Cooper by Harry Charsley.</p>
      <p>Argyle equalised in the 45th minute with a well-taken penalty from Clarke.</p>
      <p>The spot kick was awarded for a foul on Clarke by Matthew Foulds and he then clipped the ball down the middle of the goal as ‘keeper Harry Tyrer went to his left.</p>
      <p>Everton dominated the second half and had a number of chances but could not find a way past Cooper.</p>
      <p>Argyle then almost grabbed a late winning goal after a counter attack led by Tafari Moore.</p>
      <p>He played the ball outside to Alex Fletcher, who picked out fellow substitute Luke Jephcott with a low cross into the Everton penalty area.</p>
      <p>Jephcott stretched to touch the ball towards goal, only for Tyrer to touch it wide of his near post for a corner.</p>
