      <h1>Hong Kong protester shot at close range, counterprotester set on fire in latest escalation of violence</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T10:49:49+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 10:49</time> by <a rel="author">Nicole Darrah</a></address>
      <p>A pro-democracy protester was shot at close range and a counterprotester was set on fire as violence continued to engulf <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/hong-kong">Hong Kong</a> on Monday morning, with the disturbing images of street fights and escalating attacks from both sides drowning out an appeal by the city's embattled leader for an end to demonstrations.</p>
      <p>Carrie Lam, the pro-China chief executive of Hong Kong, laid the blame for the ongoing demonstrations deteriorating into chaos squarely at the feet of the pro-democracy protesters, who she labeled "rioters." But videos emerging from the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/asia">autonomous Chinese territory</a> showed the mayhem being instigated from all angles.</p>

          <b>HONG KONG POLICE SHOOT PROTESTER IN VIDEO POSTED TO FACEBOOK</b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>Video of one horrific incident showed a man, who is described as being opposed to the protesters, having a substance thrown on him which then ignites, consuming the man's upper body in flames.</p>

      <p>Lam said the man was in critical condition after he was set on fire, and described the attack as "totally inhumane," <a href="https://www.afp.com/en/news/15/police-shoot-protester-man-set-fire-day-hong-kong-fury-doc-1m62c15">AFP reported</a>.</p>
      <p>In another alarming interaction, a police officer is seen shooing away a group of protesters at a street intersection, then drawing his gun on one masked demonstrator who approaches him. As the two struggle, the officer points his gun at a second protester who walks toward him <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/hong-kong-police-appear-shoot-protester-facebook-video">and shoots him at close range in the stomach area</a>.</p>
      <p>The protester falls to the ground as the police officer appears to fire again as a third protester enters the melee. Authorities said only one protester was shot and was in critical condition at a nearby hospital.</p>

      <p>Lam on Monday said "rioters" were to blame for destroying Hong Kong and cautioned that violence won't get demonstrators what they want.</p>
      <p>“If there’s still any wishful thinking that by escalating violence, the Hong Kong [special administrative region of China] government will yield to pressure, to satisfy the so-called political demands, I’m making this statement clear and loud here: that will not happen,” she said, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-protests/pam-pam-pam-shooting-of-protester-marks-step-up-in-hong-kong-violence-idUSKBN1XL00W">according to Reuters</a>.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The violence, fueled by demands for democratic reforms, is likely to further <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions">inflame passions in Hong Kong</a> after a student who fell during an earlier protest succumbed to his injuries and died on Friday. The unrest also intensified after police over the weekend arrested six pro-democracy lawmakers, who have all been freed on bail, on charges of obstructing the local assembly during a raucous May 11 meeting over the extradition bill.</p>

      <p>Elsewhere in the city on Monday, police fired tear gas and deployed a water cannon, and charged onto the campus of Chinese University, where students were protesting. Video posted online also showed a policeman on a motorcycle riding through a group of protesters in an apparent attempt to disperse them.</p>
      <p>The protests, which began in June, were sparked over a proposed extradition law and have expanded to include demands for greater democracy and police accountability. Activists say Hong Kong's autonomy and Western-style civil liberties, promised when the former British colony was <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world">returned to China in 1997</a>, are crumbling.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, police fired tear gas and protesters vandalized stores at shopping malls in anti-government demonstrations across Hong Kong. They targeted businesses whose owners are seen as pro-Beijing and also damaged the Sha Tin train station.</p>

      <p>Police said they <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/crime">arrested at least 88 people on various charges</a>, including unlawful assembly, possession of an offensive weapon, criminal damage and wearing masks at an unlawful assembly.</p>
