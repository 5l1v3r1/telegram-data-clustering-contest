      <p>Former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has told beIN Sports that he tried and failed to lure Lionel Messi and Gerard Pique to the London club in 2003.</p>
      <p>In that same year, the French coach managed to bring in Cesc Fabregas from La Masia, with the Spain midfielder going on to have a huge impact for the Gunners.</p>
      <p>However, he came up short in his attempt to sign some of the other great talents from Barca's generation of 1987.</p>
      <p>"We tried, we were not near to signing Messi," Wenger said. "But we tried to sign Pique, Fabregas and Messi, of course, we already tried but he was already too big at the time.</p>
      <p>"Don't forget in 2006 when we played the Champions League final against Barcelona, Messi couldn't play because he was injured... so that's 13 years ago and he was already a regular player in the first team. What this guy has done is unbelievable."</p>
