      <p>A high school teacher has been arrested after she was filmed beating a special needs student.</p>
      <p>In the video, Tiffani Shadell Lankford, 32, can be seen punching the 16-year-old pupil in the face at Lehman High School in Kyle, Texas.</p>
      <p>Other students in the Spanish language class recorded the footage as many of them appeared in shock.</p>
      <p>The horrifying clip shows Lankford pulling the student out of a desk and stomping on her head as she lays on the ground.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old was fired from her position as a substitute teacher and was charged with aggravated assault following the incident, the Hays Consolidated Independent School District (CISD) said.</p>
      <p>The teen's family was "disturbed" by the attack, their lawyer Paul Batrice said.</p>
      <p>“We are shocked and disgusted after seeing the abuse and excessive force used in this teacher’s attempt to discipline a special needs child,” Batrice added.</p>
      <p>"There is no excuse for this type of behaviour.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>"Given this teacher’s alleged criminal history of domestic violence and the video footage that has shaken our community, we have started an investigation into this teacher and Hays CISD in the hopes of ensuring justice for this family and so that no Texas student ever endures such extreme behaviour again.</p>
      <p>“All parents, myself included, should be deeply disturbed by the facts surrounding this attack.”</p>
      <p>Lankford already had a prior offense for a 2014 domestic violence incident, the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/10/teacher-caught-on-camera-beating-special-needs-student/">New York Post</a> reports.</p>
      <p>The teen, who suffers from seizures, was treated for severe injuries.</p>
      <p>Police said the student was taken to a local hospital and is still recovering, according to <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7670065/Shocking-moment-female-teacher-32-caught-video-brutally-beating-student.html?fbclid=IwAR2r88OQYE8oI4ijx2syyQA0YOMGtdY9NNrOjeD_yIK_Hx2Ii2XyCFsOu8Q">Mail Online</a>.</p>
      <p>Officials from the Hays Consolidated Independent School District shared a statement regarding the incident on Friday. </p>
      <p>"As a Hays CISD family, when one of our schools and students is hurting, we all hurt. You may have already seen stories on the news tonight, or the video on social media, about a horrible incident that occurred late this afternoon at Lehman High School.</p>
      <p>"It was a traumatic event for the student, her classmates, and the teachers and staff at Lehman High School. Let us all keep the Lobos in our hearts this weekend. I know we all wish our student and her family well as she recovers from this assault,' the statement reads."</p>

      <p>Lehman Principal Karen Zuniga said: "Under no circumstance is that behaviour tolerated at Lehman High School or in Hays CISD.</p>
      <p>"We take the safety and security of our students seriously. We took swift action when this incident occurred and will do everything necessary to protect our students."</p>
      <p>Lankford's first substitute job in a classroom in the district was on September 13, 2019, according to Mail Online.</p>
      <p>She had reportedly worked there a total of 18 times, including Friday.</p>
      <p>Governor Greg Abott said in a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> message: “Conduct like this won't be tolerated in Texas classrooms.</p>
      <p>"The substitute teacher who committed this heinous act has been arrested and will face serious legal consequences.</p>
      <p>“The school district will be investigated by the Texas Education Agency.”</p>
