      <h1>Google Is Secretly Hoarding Your Medical Records</h1>

      <p>Google is secretly working with one of the biggest healthcare systems in the U.S. to collect and analyze personal health data from millions of Americans, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-s-secret-project-nightingale-gathers-personal-health-data-on-millions-of-americans-11573496790?mod=djemalertNEWS"><i>The Wall Street Journal</i> reports</a>.</p>
      <p>The megacorporation is reportedly using the data to train machine learning algorithms to suggest changes to individuals’ healthcare. It’s a far-reaching project that has the potential to threaten the privacy of millions of people — but the tech giant claims it’s both aboveboard and safe.</p>
      <p>Google has been working with the health system Ascension since 2018, according to the <i>WSJ</i>. The data collected includes things like hospitalization records, names, dates of birth, and everything from lab tests to diagnoses.</p>
      <p>The <i>WSJ</i> claims Google has told neither patients nor doctors about the project, despite collecting data on tens of millions of patients.</p>
      <p>Under the current privacy law provisions called the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the sharing of such data is technically legal, but only when it’s used to “help” a patient “carry out its health care functions,” according to the <i>WSJ</i>‘s analysis.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for Google told the <i>WSJ</i> that “Project Nightingale” complies with health law and provides sufficient data protection.</p>
      <p>But Google already has a tarnished track record: just last year, <a href="https://futurism.com/google-plus-privacy-bug">the company failed</a> to disclose a massive Google Plus-related <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-exposed-user-data-feared-repercussions-of-disclosing-to-public-1539017194?tesla=y&amp;mod=e2fb&amp;ns=prod/accounts-wsj">private user data leak</a> until months after the fact.</p>
