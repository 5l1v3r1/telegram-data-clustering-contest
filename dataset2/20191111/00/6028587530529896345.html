They have to really enhance your travel experience.Travel professionals including airline staff, travel writers, bloggers, influencers and travel agents log a lot of miles traveling all around the world. They know which travel products live up to the hype and which you can pass on.</p>

      <p>These are the 40 top-rated products for your next trip as recommended by travel professionals.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Best Luggage And Bags</b>
      </p>
      <p>Travel experts and frequent flyers agreed that when checking luggage, the most important elements were that the case was sturdy, strong and easy to spot on the carousel upon arrival.</p>
      <p>The<a href="https://iflyluggage.com/collections/hard-side/products/fibertech?variant=20421384831065"> iFLY Fibertech</a> Luggage collection comes in adorable candy colors like mint, grape and lemon. The hard shell keeps everything safe and protected inside yet is still light enough to lift easily.</p>
      <p>Run through the airport at speed with the four 360-degree wheels when connections are tight or just look good on the curb waiting for your taxi! The brand also offers a 10-year warranty for total peace of mind.</p>

      <p>Airlines allow for a personal item on board, experts suggest you maximize your space by taking a bag that can be used for a variety of purposes once you arrive at your destination.</p>
      <p>Susan Nevin is a 25-year veteran flight attendant and always takes a small leather backpack on her jaunts. “You can dress it up or down, and pair it with jeans or a little black dress. They are so versatile,” she says.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://hollyandtanager.com/products/protege?variant=17987867836467">Holly &amp; Tanager Protege</a> leather mini backpack is a bestselling chic, lightweight option with front and back pockets and enough space for a 13 inch laptop!</p>
      <p>Nevin also likes to take at least one bag that can be used more casually for the beach, like this one from <a href="https://seabags.com/horizontal-colorblock-slim-cross-body-bag.html?refSrc=7122&amp;nosto=nosto-page-product1">Sea Bags</a> of Maine. These sustainable bags are made from recycled sail cloth and come in nautical themed designs like stripes, anchors and marine life.</p>

      <p>For an elegant choice for the evening <a href="https://www.loandsons.com/pages/waverley-2-womens-convertible-crossbody-bag">The Lo &amp; Sons Waverley 2 </a>bag fits the bill. It can be worn four ways, across the body, on the waist as a belt bag, over the shoulder or as a wristlet.</p>
      <p>Overwhelmingly, regular travelers, like Cepee Tabibian, the founder of <a href="https://shehitrefresh.com/">SheHitRefresh</a>, favor luggage pods or packing cubes to keep their belongings organized in transit.</p>
      <p>Try the pack pods from <a href="https://www.sixmoondesigns.com/products/pack-pods">Six Moon Designs</a> which come in bright colors and are water resistant.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Beauty Products To Go</b>
      </p>
      <p>To earn their place in luggage on long haul trips make-up products need to do double duty.

      <p>
        <b>Hair Essentials</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mary Sander is a travel agent who regularly visits hotels to check them out prior to recommending them to her clients. For travel across North America, she always makes space in her luggage for her <a href="https://www.dyson.com/hair-care/dyson-airwrap-styler-shop-all.html">Dyson Airwrap</a>. “It’s my absolute favorite product and I can’t travel without it!” She says.</p>
      <p>The Dyson Airwrap features the coanda effect which seems to magically attract hair to the wand where it then wraps and creates perfect curls. The set also comes with a hairdryer attachment and flat and round brushes.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Traveling Products to Make You Smile</b>
      </p>
      <p>Forget the free cheap plastic toothbrush offered at some hotels, your teeth deserve the best. Try the seriously chic <a href="https://www.burstoralcare.com/">Burst Sonic toothbrush</a>, as favored by Chrissy Tiegen, which features a four week battery life to keep your teeth looking great even on long trips.</p>
      <p>It also comes with a handy travel case, a USB charging dock and charcoal infused bristles on the replacement heads.</p>
      <figure>

      <p>Pair your new toothbrush with <a href="https://www.smiletwice.com/products/the-duo">The Duo by Twice</a> alternating evening and morning toothpastes infused with antioxidants and fresh scents like peppermint, vanilla and lavender.</p>
      <p>A trip to your local <a href="https://www.cvs.com/">CVS pharmacy</a> before you leave for the airport is essential.

        <figcaption>Ponyflo Moms<cite>Ponyflo</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>It can be hard to find the right hat for travel as many of them take up a lot of space or get squashed in transit.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.ponyflohats.com/">The Ponyflo hat</a> can be worn to travel or fits neatly in a bag. The clever cut-out on the back means that you can wear any hairstyle you like including high ponytails and buns and still benefit from the shade of your cap.</p>

      <p>If you’re heading off on a trip to a colder temperature be sure to pack a warm beanie like those from Boston-based knitwear and accessories company, <a href="https://shitthatiknit.com/collections/hats">Sh*t That I Knit (STIK)</a>. They come in a massive range of colors and designs and are super soft, as they are handmade from merino and alpaca wool.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Shoes That Are Made For Travel</b>
      </p>
      <p>Shoes undeniably take up a lot of space in your luggage but if you're planning on doing a lot of different activities, you’ll need a range of options.</p>
      <p>Our expert’s best advice is to wear your biggest and heaviest shoes on travel days. If you’re going to a cold climate destination that will likely mean a pair of boots.</p>
      <p>Susan Nevin wears <a href="https://www.wearskypro.com/us/">Skypro</a>, the brand specially designed for airline professionals, but anyone can benefit from their advanced comfort and quality. Their Florence Barnes ankle boots are chic and can easily be worn all day and into the evening.</p>
      <p>For really snowy, cold destinations choose a cozy pair of NeverWet treated boots from <a href="https://www.bearpawshoes.ca/women">Bearpaw </a>which resist water and stains and keep your feet super toasty and warm.</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Beach_Please<cite>Cambiami sandals</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>If you’re flying to a beach or warm destination you’ll need some flip flops, but why not save space without sacrificing style by packing a pair of <a href="https://cambiami.com/">Cambiami customizable sandals.</a> Fitted with smart removable straps you can have three (or more) sandals in one!</p>
      <p>Shoes that do double duty really are the stars of your traveling wardrobe. The innovative <a href="https://pashionfootwear.com/">Pashion Footwear</a> brand shoes switch from stylish high heels to comfortable flats in seconds and offer two completely different looks in one pair of shoes.</p>
      <p>The heel attachment when the shoes are flat is so small it can fit into a pocket!</p>
      <p>Travel experts also loved the versatility and comfort of casual, light shoes. These can be worn around the city, to and from the airport and if you do need to pack them, they won’t make your case too heavy.</p>
      <p>Top picks included shoes from <a href="https://www.merrell.com/">Merrell</a> including their Gridway collection of super light and comfortable shoes made with 100% recycled yarn knit.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.otbtshoes.com/">OTBT Shoes </a>also scored high points for their incredibly light and cozy wool sneakers which are so on trend for the season and the perfect choice for those hitting their baggage weight allowance.</p>

        <b>Your Complete Travel Wardrobe</b>
      </p>
      <p>Again, travel experts suggested you wear your biggest bulkiest clothes to travel in.</p>
      <p>A blanket scarf is indispensable, cuddle up and use it to sleep on the plane and then accessorize all your outfits during your trip. Try <a href="https://www.sherpaadventuregear.com/">Sherpa Adventure Gear </a>‘s gorgeous green Lumbini scarf which is super soft and chic.</p>
      <p>To be prepared for any weather, throw in a <a href="https://www.sherpaadventuregear.com/collections/womens-travel-essentials/products/asaar-2-5-layer-jacket-womens">Sherpa</a> Asaar 2.5-Layer Ultra lightweight Waterproof Jacket which fits easily into small places and is wind and waterproof.</p>
      <p>Yoga pants offer a comfortable choice for travel, sports, hiking and just general sightseeing but they don’t always look professional or pulled together. That’s why travel pants with the comfort of yoga pants are so popular with frequent fliers.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5dc5a69af049680007f862cc/960x0.jpg?fit=scale"/>

      <p>Our travel experts raved about travel dresses, especially ones with stretch fabric that washed quickly on the go and could be worn day or night.</p>
      <p>Try <a href="https://www.titlenine.com/product/three-quarter-sleeve-dress-dream-200965.do?sortby=ourPicks&amp;refType=&amp;from=fn">Title Nine</a>’s Dream 3/4 sleeve dress which features a smart little snap in the front hem providing coverage when riding your bike or being active.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Menswear That Travels Well</b>
      </p>
      <p>Male professional travelers, like Lewis Todd, a pilot of 15 years, recommended menswear from the layover collection at <a href="https://roark.com/collections/layover-travel-collection">Roark</a>. You can expect quality outerwear, comfortable stretch travel pants and shorts from a brand known for adventure.</p>
      <p>The benefits of merino wool were highlighted by multiple professional travelers, for warmth, softness and its ability to control odor and wetness on those long travel days.</p>
      <p>Pack an <a href="https://unboundmerino.com/">Unbound Merino</a> T shirt and you can wear and re-wear without having to wash it thanks to the moisture-wicking properties. Stash an <a href="https://architecapparel.com/merino-hoodies">ArchiTec</a> merino hoodie into your bag to stay warm and dry no matter the situation.</p>

        <figcaption>Smart sleepwear<cite>Dagsmejan Sleepwear</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>For sweet dreams for all, a pair of <a href="https://www.dagsmejan.com/">Dagsmejan</a> pajamas should be on your packing list. They have been made in conjunction with the latest scientific sleep research to create sleepwear that regulates your temperature leading to a better, more restful night’s sleep.</p>
      <p>
        <b>All The Essential Travel Extras</b>
      </p>
      <p>It’s all the must-have extras that can take up space in your luggage but according to travel professionals some of them deserve to be there.</p>
      <p>Pack the compact <a href="https://www.pocketalk.net/">Pocketalk </a>in your bag and you’ll have 74 languages at your fingertips. The device is smaller than an average cell phone but gives you the power to communicate almost effortlessly around the world.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5dc5b974ca425400073c5739/960x0.jpg?fit=scale"/>

      </figure>
      <p>Travel expert Brendan from the <a href="https://brenontheroad.com/">Bren on the Road blog</a> often makes very long flights from New Zealand all over the world and recommends an investment in quality noise cancelling headphones. “They completely drown out the sound of the plane which makes it much easier to sleep or actually enjoy your music,” he says.</p>
      <p>Try <a href="https://www.technics.com/us/products/headphones/wireless-stereo-headphones-eah-f70n.html">Panasonic Technics Wireless headphones</a> which feature three levels of noise canceling technology in a super stylish design.</p>
      <p>An umbrella is a smart choice for almost any destination, but they can take up a lot of space. That’s why the <a href="https://davekny.com/">Davek</a> is such a great choice. Their mini version fits in the palm of your hand yet has the same phenomenal quality and attention to detail as their full-size umbrellas.</p>
      <figure>

      <p>Sure, we all have smart phones these days, but nothing can beat the nostalgic fun of snapping a Polaroid picture! Try the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Polaroid-Instant-Digital-Camera-Sticky-Backed/dp/B07G1MYGTM">Polaroid Mint Instant Print</a> digital camera for a fun way to make memories.</p>
      <p>Professional travelers see the impact of tourism on the environment firsthand. Many are making smart choices to travel less or choose greener modes of transportation. Another way they are putting the planet first is by saying no to disposable single use plastics like drinking straws and instead bringing their own. Check out <a href="https://www.sandcloud.com/products/silver-metal-straw-set">Sand Cloud</a> for metal straws that come with their own carrying pouch and cleaning brush.</p>

        <figcaption>Box+Speaker-SingleBranch<cite>Woodulisten</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>To decompress after a long day of traveling turn on the tiny <a href="https://www.amazon.com/woodulisten-Wooden-Wireless-Bluetooth-Speaker/dp/B074MN2ML4/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=woodulisten&amp;qid=1573237755&amp;sr=8-1">Woodulisten speakers</a> and enjoy all your tunes on the road with excellent high quality wireless sound.</p>
      <p>Regular travelers know it’s a bad idea to wear lots of expensive jewelry when you are far from home. They can attract thieves and easily get lost. Instead pick up a fun and colorful silicone band from <a href="https://ensorings.com/">Enso Rings.</a></p>
      <p>One thing almost all regular travelers wont leave home without in winter or summer is a quality pair of sunglasses. If you’ll also be on the water, surfing, kayaking, or just swimming it makes sense to get a pair that can float. like those from <a href="https://www.rheosgear.com/">Rheos</a>.</p>

It effortlessly turns your phone into an easy to hold point and shoot camera that also wirelessly charges your device!</p>
