      <p>Shares of <a href="https://www.five9.com/"><b>Five9</b></a> (FIVN) rose nearly 9% in one session last week after the provider of cloud-based software for contact centers reported Q3 revenue that topped the consensus estimate by 6.5% and issued upside guidance for the December quarter. The company is a prime beneficiary of the $24 billion worldwide contact center market slowly but steadily transitioning to the cloud. Today, 10% to 15% of all global call center agents utilize cloud-based software, up from about 5% five years ago. With the vast majority of contact centers still using on-premises solutions, Five9<b> </b>is well-positioned to win new cloud business, going up against key competitor NICE (NICE) for market share.</p>
      <p>Aided by easy implementations, the contact center market is moving to the cloud because of the associated efficiencies and TCO savings of as much as 40%. The cloud migration is tied to the natural refresh cycle for on-prem solutions as well as the overall digital transformation trend taking place across the enterprise space. Companies see that the economics of the cloud make sense over the alternative of spending lots of money to upgrade outdated legacy products. </p>
      <p>Organizations no longer view the contact center purely as a cost center. Given the increased interest these days in improving the overall customer experience, companies are now investing in the call center, which has evolved to be seen as a business differentiator, as it’s often the first line of contact with a customer. Companies are now trying to make sure all calls get handled as efficiently as possible by reps who are fully equipped to quickly get issues resolved.</p>
      <p>The so-called evangelism phase of the cloud transition is over, according to Five9 CEO Rowan Trollope. Companies no longer need to be sold on the benefits of the cloud, which is positive for Five9 because it means reduced sales cycles. But many large organizations still use a number of legacy call center solutions in their various divisions, and they’re not going to replace them all at once. That means the cloud transition is usually a decentralized decision made by each department.</p>
      <p>When it comes to call center sizes, Gartner estimates that deployments of 50 or fewer seats make up 25% of the market, while the largest call centers (500+ seats) account for another 25%. That leaves half of the market made up of deployments of 51 to 499 seats. </p>
      <p>A typical large organization with 10+ call centers might initially move a few to the cloud as part of a test phase before eventually shifting fully away from on-prem. That fits perfectly into Five9’s sales model.</p>
      <p>The enterprise market today represents about 80% of Five9’s business. The largest enterprise customers, those with more than $1 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), account for 25%+ of total revenue. The company’s enterprise sweet spot for cloud deployments is 500 to 5,000 seats. As part of its land-and-expand strategy, Five9 often wins a modest initial deployment with an enterprise account, knowing that there’s ample potential follow-on business.</p>
      <p>The channel is an important go-to-market vehicle for Five9, as more than 60% of all of the company’s enterprise deals flow through technology partners, resellers and systems integrators (SIs). With global SIs—including Deloitte, Accenture and E&amp;Y—often leading enterprises through digital transformations, Five9 has experienced solid momentum within this segment of the channel, which is now driving a meaningful portion of new bookings. </p>
      <p>Dan Burkland, who has led Five9’s sales organizations for nearly a decade, has been a major force in expanding the enterprise business. This year, Burkland promoted Andy Dignan to senior VP of global channels and services. Dignan, a contact-center veteran who previously led the global go-to-market strategy for Cisco’s collaboration business, is now in charge of Five9’s channel and international growth strategy.</p>
      <p>In Q3, Five9’s enterprise subscription revenue advanced 36%. Per-share earnings of 20 cents topped the consensus by five cents. The company’s Q4 revenue guidance range of $86 million to $87 million came in above the consensus estimate of $83.8 million. For 2019, Five9 raised its top-line guidance midpoint by 2.7%.</p>
      <p>The company’s strong fundamentals over the past couple of years have been a boon for the stock price. Five9 shares in 2018 returned 75%. So far this year, the stock is up 41% YTD. The all-time high of $65.45 was reached in late August. At recent prices, Five9’s enterprise value is 11.3 times the 2019 consensus revenue estimate of $322.4 million (representing growth of 25.2%).</p>
