      </p>
      <p>THE country’s trade chief has vowed to intensify the compliance-monitoring of steel bars used for the construction of structures in light of the series of earthquakes that shook Mindanao.</p>
      <p>Trade Secretary Ramon M. Lopez committed to investigate the prevalence of substandard steel products in the market in response to House Resolution 379. Filed by Rep. Lawrence H. Fortun of the First District of Agusan del Norte, the resolution called for an investigation on the alleged prevalence of below-standard construction materials considering the infrastructure damage left by the string of earthquakes in Mindanao.</p>
      <p>Fortun said that the House Committee on Mindanao Affairs and the House Committee on Trade and Industry will conduct a joint probe on the alleged smuggling of steel products following the deaths and destruction in the wake of three strong earthquakes that hit Mindanao in just two weeks in October.</p>
      <p>“We welcome this call and shall fully cooperate and support the investigation to be conducted in order to ensure that the public will not be harmed by substandard construction materials,” Lopez said in a statement over the weekend.</p>
      <p>“In fact, under President Duterte’s administration, DTI [Department of Trade and Industry] has made stricter the rules on standard compliance. We are including more products in the list of mandatory compliance and have even increased the sample size of products to be tested,” he added.</p>
      <p>Some the DTI’s new guidelines include raising the sample size for product testing, checking the Philippine Standard mark and standards of manufacturing plants and implementing inspection mechanisms at different stages of transport from pre-shipment to post-shipment and audit in retail.</p>
      <p>As proof, Lopez said his agency issued 61 notices of violation against business establishments found selling substandard nonconforming steel bars just this year alone. In the last two months, authorities visited 14 factories involving 19 standard licenses for steel products.</p>
      <p>During these inspections, samples were randomly drawn and submitted to the Metal Industry Research and Development Center  for independent laboratory testing.</p>
      <p>As a result, the DTI suspended two standard licenses of factories found manufacturing below-standard steel bars. A total of 57,250 pieces of nonconforming steel with an estimated value of P6.5 million were likewise destroyed.</p>
      <p>“We heightened the campaign against substandard products because it is not safe for consumers and unfair to local manufacturers who will face cheap competition. This, in turn, may shrink the country’s manufacturing base and lead to job losses. Clearly, smuggling substandard steel is detrimental to the mission of the agency,” the trade chief said.</p>
      <p>The DTI is conducting consultations with stakeholders for its plan to include more construction materials on its list of products up for mandatory testing. Among those that DTI is eyeing to put on the mandatory testing list are plywood, ceramic tiles, roofing and BI/GI pipes.</p>
      <h3>Import curbs</h3>
      <p>To address the alleged rampant smuggling of substandard steel, the House of Representatives will work on the passage of a law seeking stricter regulation on the importation of construction products.</p>
      <p>However, Agusan del Norte congressman Fortun said the House will hear first his House Resolution 379 to look into the alleged collusion between large steelmakers and officials of the DTI and the Bureau of Customs (BOC) in the smuggling of substandard steel products.</p>
      <p>After hearing the resource persons invited to the House probe, Fortun said a measure will be recommended to prevent deceitful selling of construction products, including quenched tempered steel bars that could have compromised the structural soundness of some infrastructure in the country in the last 10 to 12 years.</p>
      <p>“We hope to be able to introduce major reforms to regulations on importation, inspection and testing of steel products, as well as other construction materials,” said Fortun.</p>
      <p>Recently, the BOC announced that it was cracking down on undervalued steel importations amid reports of substandard QT steel bars, while Presidential Anti-Corruption Commission Commissioner Manuelito Luna bared that the parallel inquiry of the agency headed by chairman Dante Jimenez found sufficient evidence to down those responsible for the alleged technical smuggling of billions of steel bars. Earlier, the BOC also disclosed that four to five big steel companies were being audited.</p>
      <p>“The resolution will be referred to two committees, namely, the Committee on Trade and Industry and the Committee on Mindanao Affairs. The Mindanao Affairs committee is taking cognizance because of the urgency of the matter in Mindanao,” said Fortun.</p>
      <p>Fortun explained the joint committee hearing “is for us to be able to commence the hearings soon. We know that the Committee on Trade and Industry is also loaded with several priority legislations that the House leadership wants acted on immediately. With the [Committee on] Mindanao Affair…handling the inquiry jointly with the Trade and Industry committee, we can proceed accordingly with the chair of either committee presiding over the hearings.”</p>
      <p>HR 379 seeks to “protect consumers from trade malpractices and from substandard or hazardous products.”</p>
