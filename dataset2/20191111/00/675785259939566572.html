      <p>A murder investigation has been launched following the death of a woman in a "quiet" village.</p>
      <p>Suffolk Police said a 52-year-old woman has been arrested on suspicion of murder.</p>
      <p>The force was called to a property in Norwich Road, Little Stonham, at around 3.30am on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Officers and paramedics attended, but a woman aged in her forties died at the scene.</p>
      <p>Police said the female suspect was taken to Martlesham Police Investigation Centre.</p>
      <p>One man who lives on the road reported seeing six police cars and an ambulance outside the property when he returned at 5.20am.</p>
      <p>Carole Shaw, who has lived in the village for three years, told East Anglian Daily Times: "It's just a bit of a dampener that happened on my doorstep."</p>

      <p>Stonham district councillor Suzie Morley expressed a similar level of disbelief that such an incident would happened in Little Stonham.</p>
      <p>"Obviously any murder is horrific and you never expect it to be on your patch," she said.</p>
      <p>One person who said they had lived in the area for 37 years described Little Stonham as "quiet" with "no troubles".</p>
      <p>Little Stonham had a population of 350 people as of 2005.</p>
      <p>Anyone with any information about the incident is asked to contact the Major Investigation Team, quoting reference number CAD 51 of 10 November, by visiting the force's website or calling 101.</p>
      <p>Alternatively people can ring Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.</p>
