      <p>Any day now the Food and Drug Administration is expected to announce new regulations for flavored electronic cigarettes and vaping products. Though a blanket ban of flavored e-cigarette and vaping products had been initially feared by thousands of small business owners who stand to be ruined by such a ban, along with the millions of consumers who use flavored vape products as an alternative to more harmful cigarettes, it is now reported that the Trump administration is reconsidering that approach. While this federal announcement, which has the potential to shutdown nearly 10,000 small businesses a few weeks before Christmas, is awaited anxiously by many, there has been an uptick in state-level activity in recent days and weeks related to the regulation and taxation of electronic cigarettes and vaping devices. </p>
      <p>It started with New York Governor Andrew Cuomo (D), who issued <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/09/15/vaping-illnesses-cuomo-bans-flavored-e-cigarettes-amid-vape-crackdown/2334942001/">an executive order</a> on September 15 banning flavored electronic cigarettes and vaping products in the Empire State. A lawsuit has been filed challenging the New York flavored vape ban, as is the case with Governor Gretchen Whitmer’s vape ban in Michigan. These legal challenges have <a href="https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2019/11/trump-suggests-raising-vaping-age-to-21-gov-whitmers-flavor-ban-lingers.html">prevented both of those prohibitions from going into effect</a> for the time being. </p>
      <p>Lawsuits have also been filed against the flavored vape and e-cigarette bans issued through executive fiat by Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker (R) and Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo (D). Unlike the cases in Michigan and New York, the courts have allowed the <a href="https://www.bostonherald.com/2019/10/21/judge-allows-vaping-ban-to-remain-in-place/">Massachusetts</a> and <a href="https://turnto10.com/news/local/judge-to-issue-ruling-in-suit-over-ban-on-flavored-vaping-products">Rhode Island</a> vape bans to take effect.</p>
      <p>While blue state e-cig and vape bans are devastating to thousands of small businesses, they’re not a surprising development given the political makeup of those state governments. What is surprising was the move two weeks ago by some Republican lawmakers in North Carolina to raise the state’s vape and e-cig tax. </p>
      <p>On the morning of October 30, the North Carolina House Finance Committee amended Senate-approved legislation so as to remove a tax cut for employers and <a href="https://www.atr.org/north-carolina-house-finance-committee-removes-tax-cut-approves-tax-hike">insert an increase in the state’s electronic cigarette and vape tax</a>. This move caught many off-guard, including North Carolina House Republicans not on the Finance Committee, who cleaned up the matter later in the day by reversing the tax-hiking amendments that were hastily and unexpectedly approved by the Finance Committee that morning. </p>
      <p>North Carolina is one of <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/state-vapor-taxes-2019/">nine states</a>, along with the District of Columbia, that already levies a state-level tax on electronic cigarettes and vaping devices. </p>

      </figure>
      <p>Hours after the North Carolina House Finance Committee made the aforementioned changes, the House Rules Committee reversed them, removing the e-cig/vape tax hike and restoring the franchise tax cut for North Carolina employers. </p>
      <p>While discussing these developments on NPR last Friday, November 8, WUNC politics reporter Jeff Tiberi <a href="https://www.wunc.org/post/nc-politics-redistricting-begins-again-berger-under-fire-vaping-tax-dies">remarked</a> that the amendment to raise the vape tax was “removed very quickly.” </p>
      <p>However, if anything happened quickly with this issue it was the Finance Committee’s surprise introduction and approval of the e-cig/vape tax hike to begin with. </p>
      <p>During last Friday’s on-air discussion about the vape tax hike’s abrupt introduction and subsequent abortion, WUNC’s Tiberi also alluded to the vaping-related deaths that have occurred in recent weeks and months across the country. </p>
      <p>Here Tiberi is doing what many in the media have done in recent weeks, which is to falsely and misleadingly suggest that the deaths that have been attributed to the use of illicit THC vaping products are somehow associated with legal electronic cigarettes and vaping devices that contain nicotine, products which have nothing to do with the recent deaths but which have helped millions of adults quit smoking cigarettes. </p>
      <p>A November 7 <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-11-07/taxing-e-cigarettes-like-juul-is-a-good-way-to-stop-teen-vaping?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_content=view&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-view">Bloomberg editorial</a> recently did the same thing while advocating for the federal e-cig/vape tax bill that recently passed out of the U.S. House Ways &amp; Means Committee. In that misleading piece, the Bloomberg editorial board conflates deaths tied to the use of THC vaping products with legal nicotine-delivering e-cigarettes and vaping products, which have no ties to those deaths. </p>
      <p>This author reached out to David Shipley, the Bloomberg senior editor responsible for the aforementioned editorial and asked why the Bloomberg editorial didn’t see fit to inform readers that the 37 deaths referenced in the editorial had nothing to do with legal, nicotine-delivering e-cig and vaping products that Bloomberg is calling for a new national tax on.</p>
      <p>Shipley thus far has declined to comment as to why Bloomberg is still publishing misleading information on this matter, even though there is now a wealth of evidence suggesting that the deaths are tied to the use of illegal, tainted THC vape cartridges. </p>
      <p>On CNBC’s Squawk Box this morning, former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb confirmed that the vaping-related deaths are tied to illicit THC vape cartridges containing toxic additives, not products containing nicotine. Though the truth is beginning to come out, widespread reporting of misinformation on vaping has already had an impact, causing many people to be either ill-informed or misinformed. </p>
      <p>“According to a <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2019/09/19/as-vaping-related-lung-illnesses-worsen-public-holds-e-cigarettes-like-juul-culpable/">Morning Consult poll</a> conducted in September 58% of respondents believed people had ‘died from lung disease’ caused by ‘e-cigarettes’ based on what they had ‘seen, read, or heard on the news lately,” <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuacohen/2019/11/10/importance-of-nuance-in-media-reporting-on-vaping-and-opioid-epidemics/#7f8c92c064ef">writes</a> Joshua Cohen, a Forbes contributor. “Merely 34% of respondents said the cases involved ‘marijuana or THC e-cigarettes.’ Perhaps most striking of all, only 22% of respondents understood that e-cigarettes are generally considered less hazardous than the conventional kind.”</p>
      <p>Given the bevy of misleading coverage similar to the November 7 Bloomberg editorial, polling that shows the public to be so misinformed makes sense. Despite the ongoing spread of misinformation, the White House appears to be pumping the breaks on the national flavored vape ban. </p>
      <p>In a sign that the White House is reconsidering its course, President Donald Trump tweeted today that he is convening a meeting of vaping industry representatives and health officials. </p>
      <p>A lie can get halfway around the world before the truth has had a chance to put its pants on, so goes the old saying often incorrectly attributed to Winston Churchill. Misinformation about vape-related deaths and illnesses has been spread far and wide, by major media outlets and reporters who should know better, but it appears that the truth now has its pants on and is starting to break through. Despite the misinformation-filled nationwide media hysteria over vape products, there remains a possibility that cooler heads might still ultimately prevail.</p>
