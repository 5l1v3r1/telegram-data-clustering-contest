      <p><a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/in-the-age-of-ai/">On November 5, 2019, PBS/Frontline aired <i>In the Age of AI</i>: </a> <i>“FRONTLINE investigates the promise and perils of artificial intelligence, from fears about work and privacy to rivalry between the U.S. and China. The documentary traces a new industrial revolution that will reshape and disrupt our lives, our jobs and our world, and allow the emergence of the surveillance society.”</i></p>
      <p>The film has five distinct messages about:</p>
      <p>1.     China’s AI Plan</p>
      <p>2.     The Promise of AI</p>
      <p>3.     The Future of Work</p>
      <p>4.     Surveillance Capitalism</p>
      <p>5.     The Surveillance State</p>
      <p>First the exciting part. As a business technologist, I am beyond excited about the possibilities of artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning (“AI”) and all of the application areas already impacted by the technology. The marriage of statistical analyses, adaptive pattern recognition, big data and computational efficiency to describe, explain, predict and actuate events, conditions and processes is thriving. It all came together at roughly the same time. Data – necessary to create and validate “smart” algorithms – meets sensors, meets high speed communications, meets advanced computing, meets new knowledge representation and problem-solving tools and techniques. In the 1990s, when the concepts and initial demonstrations were well defined, scaling was next to impossible. Plus, many of the simplest pattern and image recognition techniques were still lacking; progress in these and other areas since the 90s has been staggering. There are so many applications designed to both save money and make money. Many of them make life better. <a href="https://bernardmarr.com/default.asp?contentID=1683">Well-documented cases are everywhere</a>.</p>
      <p>Depending upon who you want to believe, autonomous vehicles, knowledge worker replacement and fully automated factories and farms are years or only a decade away. The trend to watch is the domain extensibility of machine and deep learning, the application of learning to general domains, not just “narrow,” more easily modeled problem domains.  </p>
      <p>Now the frightening part. Every time we blog, tweet, post, rideshare, order from Amazon, rent an Airbnb – or anything that leaves a digital trail – we feed what <a href="https://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/titles/shoshana-zuboff/the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism/9781610395694/">Shoshana Zuboff</a> calls “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism">surveillance capitalism</a>,” which is the <a href="https://searchcio.techtarget.com/definition/data-monetization">monetization</a> <a href="https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/surveillance-capitalism">of data captured through monitoring people's movements and behaviors online and in the physical world</a>.  </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/steveandriole/2019/05/09/while-you-were-watching-mueller-barr-trump-whoever-youve-been-under-constant-surveillance/#68052d9e6a96">Countless digital systems now track where we are, where we go, what we eat, what we think, who we like, who we love, where we bank, what we know and who we hate – among lots of other things they know all too well because we remind them over and over again</a>. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/11/tech/amazon-alexa-listening/index.html">Is Alexa listening</a>? <a href="https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/31/ro-khanna/your-amazon-alexa-spying-you/">Do you know <i>for sure </i>she’s not</a>? Have you ever wondered how a simple search for barbecue sauce follows you around the web? Have you worried about how easy – or hard – it is to be digitally impersonated? Have you been to London? Do you realize how often you’re photographed and filmed? Is your face linked to your travels, your preferences, your loves?  </p>
      <p>As <i>In the Age of AI</i> describes, AI will take surveillance to the next level. It’s capable of integrating data across many sources and describing, explaining and predicting human behavior. It enables all forms of surveillance. It can retrieve pictures, words, text, images, video and past behavior and synthesize them in real time with frightening accuracy. Within a few years, it will be possible for companies to profile nearly all of us from how we live our rich, full digital lives. But it will also empower government offices and agencies to do the same thing. Some of this will be good, such as enabling the pursuit, capture and prosecution of criminals. But some of it will be scary, such as what might happen when social, economic and political enemies seek control, revenge or worse.  </p>
      <p>Let’s look at the most exciting and frightening parts of the film, and offer some takeaways:</p>
      <p>
        <b>Message 1:  China’s AI Plan</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>NARRATOR:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“In 2017, Xi Jinping announced the government’s bold new plans to an audience of foreign diplomats … China would catch up with the U.S. in artificial intelligence by 2025 and lead the world by 2030 … today, China leads the world in e-commerce. Drones deliver to rural villages. And a society that bypassed credit cards now shops in stores without cashiers, where the currency is facial recognition.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>KAI-FU LEE:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“So the Chinese entrepreneurial companies started as copycats, but over the last 15 years, China has developed its own form of entrepreneurship, and that entrepreneurship is described as tenacious, very fast, winner-take-all and incredible work ethic … I would say these few thousand Chinese top entrepreneurs, they could take on any entrepreneur anywhere in the world.”</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>Takeaway? </b>The US and China are clearly involved in a technology arms race that should be recognized as such by decision makers in the US (since the Chinese have already declared war). <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/steveandriole/2018/11/09/artificial-intelligence-china-and-the-us-how-the-us-is-losing-the-technology-war/#47b382456195">This recognition should manifest in national policies, funding and other specific responses</a>. If the US wants to win the AI arms race, it must act immediately and aggressively. It must rethink its approach to AI funding recognizing the role the government should play in the development of a national AI infrastructure, among other steps it should take.</p>
      <p>
        <b>KAI-FU LEE:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“China is the best place for AI implementation today, because the vast amount of data that's available in China. China has a lot more users than any other country – three to four times more than the U.S. There are 50 times more mobile payments than the U.S. There are 10 times more food deliveries, which serve as data to learn more about user behavior, than the U.S. Three hundred times more shared bicycle rides, and each shared bicycle ride has all kinds of sensors submitting data up to the cloud. We're talking about maybe 10 times more data than the U.S., and AI is basically run on data and fueled by data. The more data, the better the AI works – more importantly than how brilliant the researcher is working on the problem. So in the age of AI, where data is the new oil, China is the new Saudi Arabia.”</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>Takeaway?</b>  The amount of data constitutes a clear competitive advantage to the Chinese.</p>
      <p>
        <b>JIAO KE:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Here is our application. The customer can choose how [much] money they want to borrow and how long they want to borrow and they can input their data here.  And after that, you can just borrow very quickly.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>NARRATOR:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“It takes an average of 8 seconds … in the 8 seconds, the algorithm has assessed 5,000 personal features from all your data.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>JIAO KE:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Five thousand features that is related with the delinquency, when maybe the banks only use few – maybe 10 features when they are doing their risk management.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>NARRATOR:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Processing millions of transactions, it’ll dig up features that would never be apparent to a human loan officer, like how confidently you type your loan application or, surprisingly, if you keep your cell phone battery charged.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>JIAO KE:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“It's very interesting – the battery of the phone is related with their delinquency rate. Someone who has much more lower battery, they get much more dangerous than others.”</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>Takeaway? </b>There are patterns and relationships now discoverable from autonomously mining big data, such as relationships among battery power, typing confidence and credit worthiness, that were unknowable. Such relationships are discoverable – among 5,000 features – and correlated with worthiness, making predictions about default much more accurate. This methodology is extensible and scalable.</p>
      <p>
        <b>WU WENHAO:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“ … on the mobile device, we have timed the facial recognition speed. It's actually less than 100 milliseconds. So that's very, very fast. So 0.1 second that we will be able to recognize you, even on a mobile device … we are the first one to really take facial recognition to commercial quality.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>NARRATOR:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“That’s why in Beijing today you can pay for your KFC with a smile.”</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>Takeaway?</b> Facial recognition is powerful. It’s also incredibly convenient. But it enables surveillance of the worst possible kind. But does the world want Chinese facial recognition technology to dominate facial recognition applications across the globe?   </p>
      <p>
        <b>Message 2:  The Promise of AI</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>AMY WEBB:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“As AI progresses, the great promise is that they – these machines alongside of us are able to think and imagine and see things in ways that we never have before.  Which means that maybe we have some kind of new, weird, seemingly implausible solution to climate change. Maybe we have some radically different approach to dealing with incurable cancers … the real practical and wonderful promise is that machines help us be more creative, and using that creativity, we get to terrific solutions.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>BRAD SMITH:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Because AI is a little bit like electricity. Everybody's going to use it. Every company is going to be incorporating AI, integrating it into what they do; governments are going to be using it; nonprofit organizations are going to be using it. It's going to create all kinds of benefits in ways large and small, and challenges for us as well.”</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>Takeaway? </b>AI is already a utility with enormous promise, including solutions development for intractable problems.  </p>
      <p>
        <b>Message 3:  The Future of Work</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>KAI-FU LEE:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“I believe about 50% of jobs will be somewhat or extremely threatened by AI in the next 15 years or so … AI will be at the same time a replacement for blue-collar, white-collar jobs, and be a great symbiotic tool for doctors, lawyers and you, for example.  But the white-collar jobs are easier to take, because they’re a pure quantitative analytical process. </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>ANDREW McAFEE:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“There are still plenty of factories in America. We are a manufacturing powerhouse, but if you go walk around an American factory, you do not see long lines of people doing repetitive manual labor.  You see a whole lot of automation.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>MIKE HICKS:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“There’s been offshoring, and I think offshoring is responsible for maybe 20% of the jobs that have been lost. I would say most of the jobs that have been lost, despite what most Americans think, was due to automation or productivity growth.”  </i>
      </p>
      <p><b>Takeaway?</b> Brace yourself. Regardless of where you sit, there’s a good chance your profession will be significantly modified – or reshaped altogether – by AI. The worst hit will be to manufacturing followed by augmentation or replacement of knowledge workers who perform well-bounded, routine tasks. Unfortunately, income and wealth inequality will be exacerbated by these trends.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Message 4:  Surveillance Capitalism</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>KAI-FU LEE:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Think about the massive data that Facebook has on user preferences and how it can very smartly target an ad that you might buy something and get a much bigger cut that a smaller company couldn't do.  Same with Google; same with Amazon.  So, it's – AI is a set of tools that helps you maximize an objective function, and that objective function initially will simply be ‘make more money.’</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>NARRATOR:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“And it is how these companies make that money, and how their algorithms reach deeper and deeper into our work, our daily lives and our democracy, that makes many people increasingly uncomfortable.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>SHOSHANA ZUBOFF:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“You know, we came into this new world thinking that we were users of social media.  It didn't occur to us that social media was actually using us. We thought that we were searching Google; we had no idea that Google was searching us.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>NARRATOR:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“The model is simply this: Provide a free service – like Facebook – and in exchange you collect the data of the millions who use it.  And every sliver of information is valuable.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>SHOSHANA ZUBOFF:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“It's not just what you post, it's that you post. It's not just that you make plans to see your friends later. It's whether you say, ‘I'll see you later’ or ‘I'll see you at 6:45.’ It's not just that you talk about the things that you have to do today; it's whether you simply rattle them on in a rambling paragraph or list them as bullet points … all of these tiny signals are the behavioral surplus that turns out to have immense predictive value … the point is that this is the same micro-behavioral targeting that is directed toward individuals based on intimate, detailed understanding of personalities. So this is precisely what Cambridge Analytica did, simply pivoting from the advertisers to the political outcomes.”</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>Takeaway? </b>Perhaps the most important takeaway is the business model that fuels social media based on personal data which everyone volunteers to the companies that sells it for enormous profit. It’s a model that assumes that “users” generate product which the companies they use get to monetize. Should there be some level of regulation on the collection of all this data and the business models that use it? Are there legitimate privacy issues that should be addressed? Or does convenience outweigh surveillance? </p>
      <p>
        <b>5: The Surveillance State</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>NARRATOR:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“It’s been projected that over 600 million cameras will be deployed [in China] by 2020. </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>XIAO QIANG:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“ … there is a project called Sharp Eyes which is putting camera on every major street and corner of every village in China, meaning everywhere; matching with the most advanced artificial intelligence algorithm which they can actually use this data, real-time data, to pick up a face or pick up an action.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>XIAO QIANG:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“China is on its way to building a total surveillance state.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>AMY WEBB:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“There are 58 countries that are starting to plug into China's vision of artificial intelligence … which means effectively that China is in the process of raising a Bamboo Curtain; one that does not need to—one that is sort of all encompassing; that has shared resources; shared telecommunications systems; shared infrastructure; shared digital systems; even shared mobile phone technologies.  That is quickly going up all around the world to the exclusion of us in the West.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>YOSHUA BENGIO:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“ … I do think that democracy is threatened by the progress of these tools unless we improve our social norms and we increase the collective wisdom at the planet level to deal with that increased power … I'm hoping that my concerns are not founded, but the stakes are so high that I don't think we should take these concerns lightly. I don't think we can play with those possibilities and just race ahead without thinking about the potential outcomes.”</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>Takeaway?</b> There are larger issues are at play. Perhaps there’s an overreaction to AI’s power to change entire social, economic and political structures, but perhaps not. <i>In the Age of AI</i> does much more than explain the power and reach of AI. It also asks some potentially game-changing questions. <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/in-the-age-of-ai/">It is well worth two hours of your time</a> – and then some.</p>
