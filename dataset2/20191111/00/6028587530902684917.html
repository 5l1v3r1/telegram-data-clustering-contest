      <h1>iPhone-Maker Apple’s New Credit Card Has An Awkward Problem</h1>

      <p>Apple, the company behind the revolutionary iPhone, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2019/03/27/apple-is-all-out-of-ideas/#149d767a1425">made waves when it announced it was jumping headfirst in the finance industry earlier this year with a hotly-anticipated credit card</a>.Apple launched its credit card in partnership with Wall Street banking giant Goldman Sachs over the summer, promising a "new kind of credit card, created by Apple, not a bank."</p>
      <p>However, an awkward row has erupted over Apple's credit limit algorithms, with a prominent tech entrepreneur suggesting the iPhone-maker is discriminating against women.</p>

      <p>Last week, tech entrepreneur David Heinemeier Hansson took to Twitter to complain Apple's credit card offered him a credit limit 20 times higher than his wife's.</p>
      <p>Hansson added that his spouse, Jamie Hansson, had a better credit score and other factors in her favor but her application for a credit line increase had been denied by the iPhone-maker.</p>
      <p>"My wife and I filed joint tax returns, live in a community-property state, and have been married for a long time," Hansson <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1192540900393705474?s=20">wrote</a>. "Yet Apple’s black box algorithm thinks I deserve 20x the credit limit she does."</p>
      <p>Following the complaint, the New York State Department of Financial Services has said it will investigate the credit limit algorithms used by Apple Card.</p>
      <p>"Any algorithm that intentionally or not results in discriminatory treatment of women or any other protected class violates New York law,” an agency spokeswoman said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The row has caught the attention of other technology industry watchers, who have echoed Hansson's complaint.</p>
      <p>Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak has claimed he was offered 10 times more credit on Apple's card than his wife, suggesting there could be no reason for the two different calculations.</p>

      <p>"We have no separate bank or credit card accounts or any separate assets," said on Twitter, in reply to Hansson’s original tweet.</p>
      <p>"Hard to get to a human for a correction though. It’s big tech in 2019."</p>
      <p>Apple has not responded to a request for comment, while MasterCard, which provides support for Apple Card’s global payments network, referred questions to Goldman Sachs.</p>
      <p>Apple, which has been looking to diversify away from its ailing iPhone cash cow, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2019/08/04/blow-to-bitcoin-as-iphone-maker-apple-reveals-sudden-swerve/#62325843608e">is not allowing users of its credit card to purchase bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies</a> after some had hoped Apple's jump into finance might signal it could be taking an interest in crypto.</p>
