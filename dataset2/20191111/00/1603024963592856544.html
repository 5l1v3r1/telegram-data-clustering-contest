      <p>The Specialised Equipment Market Association (SEMA) recently concluded its 2019 show at the Las Vegas Convention Centre in the USA. It showcased a plethora of custom vehicles as well as futuristic prototypes by major automobile manufacturers from around the world. Here are some of the best cars which were showcased at the show.</p>
      <p>Ford is gearing up to launch its latest SUV, which is supposed to be based on the Mustang. However, the American carmaker showcased its plans to enter the electric vehicles segment, with the Mustang Lithium. The company has equipped the fully electric muscle car with an 800-volt battery sourced from Webasto. It powers an electric motor which makes 900 bhp of maximum power and 1,355 Nm of peak torque. It is mated to a Getrag-sourced 6-speed manual gearbox, which gets billet internals to handle the immense torque. However, the company has showcased the car as a prototype, with no immediate plans of taking it to production.</p>
      <p>Another American company to showcase its latest product is Dodge, which showcased the track-only version of the Challenger. It is equipped with a supercharged 354ci HEMI V8 which is paired to a T400 three-speed gearbox with a Kwik-Shift manual shifter. Since the car is developed especially for drag racing, it also gets wheelie bars, along with chassis-mounted parachute mount.</p>
