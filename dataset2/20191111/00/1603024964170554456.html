      <h2>Diesel consumption usually tapers in monsoon season as rains hit construction and mobility.</h2>

      <p>India's diesel demand is expected to recover in the next six months as a longer-than-usual monsoon season that affected transportation and industry has ended, the chairman of top domestic refiner<a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/refineries/indianoilcorporation/IOC"> Indian Oil Corp </a>(IOC) said on November 11.</p>
      <p>Diesel consumption usually tapers in monsoon season as rains hit construction and mobility. Any longer-term slowdown in fast-growing India's fuel use could dim prospects for global oil demand.</p>
      <p>"Fuel demand, especially diesel, is falling ... In (July-September) normally demand is low because of monsoons, excess rain and floods," Indian Oil's Sanjiv Singh said.</p>

      <p>India's fuel demand fell to its lowest in more than two years in September, with consumption of diesel at its weakest since January 2017.</p>
      <p>"It is a temporary slowdown," said Singh, who was in Abu Dhabi to attend an energy conference.</p>
      <p>State-owned refiners, such as IOC, Bharat Petroleum Corp and Hindustan Petroleum Corp, traditionally buy fuel from private companies to meet demand at the pump.</p>
      <p>But falling local demand for diesel, which accounts for about two-fifths of overall fuel consumption, is prompting state refiners to export the product.</p>
      <p>Singh said that in the current fiscal year to March, IOC's diesel exports could be more than before because of the slowdown in consumption. He did not elaborate.</p>
      <p>Bharat Petroleum will export about 200,000 tonnes of diesel every month between November and March, its head of finance N. Vijayagopal said last week.</p>
      <p>IOC accounts for about a third of India's refining capacity of 5 million barrels per day.</p>
      <p>Singh also said his company was looking at buying Russian oil.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
