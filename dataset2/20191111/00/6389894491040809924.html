      <p>Visionable, a healthtech startup co-founded by a former NHS manager and independent peer Lord Victor Adebowale, has today revealed its series A funding round at £9.1m.</p>
      <p>The raise was led by West Hill Capital, which valued the business at £47.6m.</p>
      <p>Visionable provides doctors, paramedics and others in the NHS with video conferencing software specifically designed for sharing clinical information and imaging.</p>
      <p>The startup participated in a trial for connected ambulances with telecoms giant O2 earlier this year, and now reaches approximately 500 patients an hour with its platform.</p>

      <p>Visionable chief Alan Lowe, who previously led the service improvement programme for NHS Westminster, said: “This latest round of funding shows that investors are just as excited as we are about the possibility for Visionable to make a real difference to the healthcare industry in the next decade.”</p>
      <p>Its software is used by over 100 NHS organisations to deliver better patient care. This includes a collaboration with the NHS in the east of England to improve stroke treatment, and its work with the North West London Cancer Network to bring together time-pressed clinicians and pathologists in multi-disciplinary teams. </p>
