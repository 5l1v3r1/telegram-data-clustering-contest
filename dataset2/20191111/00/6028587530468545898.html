      <p>According to survey data compiled by the US-based Grocery Manufacturers Assocation (GMA), roughly three quarters of Americans may believe that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates commercial CBD products, which it does not, despite the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/janetwburns/2018/07/09/mexico-could-make-history-by-treating-cbd-like-a-supplement-as-it-should-be/#26338f2d5457">non-intoxicating cannabinoid</a>’s soaring popularity.An October report by the GMA found that, among 2,056 US adults surveyed nationally, 62% had some awareness of CBD, 76% of whom thought that CBD-infused products sold commercially are being federally regulated; 53% thought the FDA does so [<a href="https://reimagine.gmaonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/TheUrgentNeedforCBDClarity.pdf">PDF</a>]. Among survey respondents who were aware of CBD, 16% weren’t sure one way or the other if such products were being regulated.</p>
      <p>In recent years, the availability of CBD-infused products (and/or products claiming to contain CBD) has skyrocketed, causing concern among health officials as well as drug reform advocates and retailers’ groups – not because CBD itself (a.k.a. cannabidiol) poses a health risk, but because consumers have no way of knowing what’s actually in those products so long as they remain unregulated.</p>
      <p>Independent testing of various commercial products has revealed undisclosed ingredients or lower-than-stated CBD content in some cases, as well a growing need for the FDA to step in, critics say.</p>

      <p>As the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) noted in a press release, “In many instances – such as those reported <a href="https://norml.org/news/2019/05/09/report-many-cbd-products-inaccurately-labeled">here</a>, <a href="https://norml.org/news/2019/04/25/report-cbd-content-in-commercial-products-typically-less-than-advertised">here</a>, <a href="https://norml.org/news/2019/03/14/report-potency-of-commercially-marketed-cbd-products-often-mislabeled">here</a>, <a href="https://norml.org/news/2019/02/14/nbc-miami-report-potency-of-commercially-marketed-cbd-products-questioned">here</a>, and <a href="https://www.consumerlab.com/reviews/cbd-oil-hemp-review/cbd-oil/">here</a> – actual quantities of CBD in the product are far lower than advertised. In other cases, testing has <a href="https://norml.org/news/2017/11/16/study-cbd-products-sold-online-are-often-mislabeled">revealed</a> the presence of THC ... [or] elevated levels of <a href="https://norml.org/news/2019/05/23/report-majority-of-commercially-available-cbd-products-contaminated-with-heavy-metals">heavy metals and solvents</a>, as well as <a href="https://norml.org/news/2019/09/19/report-many-commercially-marketed-cbd-products-tainted-with-psychoactive-adulterants">psychoactive synthetic adulterants</a> [in commercial products].”</p>
      <p>“By contrast,” NORML wrote, “CBD-infused products sold at state-licensed [cannabis] dispensaries are typically subject to state-specific regulations and lab testing protocols.”</p>
      <p>Unregulated, commercial CBD-infused products are also much more accessible than state regulated ones at present, now being available for purchase in numerous national grocery chains, drug stores, gas stations, clothing stores, and many thousands of small businesses, whether as topicals, oils and tinctures, edibles, or capsule-style supplements.</p>

      <p>"The FDA has pledged to give consumers the information they need to make smart choices about CBD products – but estimates that it could take up to five years to establish federal CBD regulations,” GMA president and CEO Geoff Freeman wrote in an op-ed for <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/468827-at-risk-and-unaware-consumers-need-cbd-regulation">The Hill</a>. “That timeline is unacceptable for a booming market.”</p>
      <p>Overall, the survey data may be a further indication that Americans need greater education around cannabis products such as CBD, as well as government regulation.</p>
      <p>For example, among survey respondents who were aware of CBD, 39% said they believe that CBD is “just another name for marijuana,” according to the report.</p>
      <p>Among the roughly one third of all respondents who had purchased commercial CBD products themselves, 23% also said that they did so “because they thought it would intoxicate them or give them a high,” the report said, which CBD will not do – a misconception that’s unlikely to cause much physical harm, at least.</p>
