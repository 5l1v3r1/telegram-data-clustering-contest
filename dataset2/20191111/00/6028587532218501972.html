      <h1>‘Watchmen’ Episode 4 Recap: The Mystery, And Horror, Deepens</h1>

      <p>With each new episode, <i>Watchmen’s</i> world drifts further away from our own, and perhaps, away from the source material. The HBO show is very much its own entity, and it's quickly morphed into one of the most unique shows on television. The clock tower looming in the background has come into focus, with the resident of said tower, Lady Trieu, self-proclaimed trillionaire, making a fairytale deal with a childless couple living on a farm. Trieu offers the two a baby in exchange for their land, and they accept, just in time for a mysterious object from space to crash-land on what is now Trieu’s property.</p>
      <p>It’s an extremely on-the-nose Superman homage - the couple is even named “the Clarks,” and might have something to do with a certain Doctor living on Mars. </p>
      <p>Angela, who we didn’t spend much time with last episode, is spending the night breaking into the reparations centre that provided her DNA analysis. Angela is trying to gather information on Will, and her own legacy in the process, through an extremely elaborate holographic representation of her family tree. </p>
      <p>Suddenly, the end of episode 3 crashes into the timeline, with Laurie and Angela now in the same place, equally confused by the arrival of Angela’s vehicle; it seems that Doctor Manhattan didn’t bother responding to Laurie after all.</p>
      <p>Angela isn’t happy to learn that Laurie has been questioning her husband, and Cal isn’t happy that he had to lie on Angela’s behalf. The whole family is a dark place, their adopted children asking questions about Judd’s death, and Cal responding with an amusingly brutal description of the oblivion that awaits the dead. </p>
      <p>Angela decides to visit Looking Glass, who lives in a bunker and is obsessing over the interdimensional squid phenomenon (and to be fair, who wouldn’t?). Glass is a bit like Dale Gribble from <i>King of the Hill</i>, but single, and his dry reply to the question of Judd’s racism, “He’s a white man in Oklahoma,” reassures me that he is too self-aware to be a member of the Seventh Cavalry. Which is a relief, because Glass is oddly likeable.</p>
      <p>As Angela disposes of Will’s wheelchair, the inherent ridiculousness of costumed vigilantes is brought into focus, with a wonderfully weird scene involving “Lube Man,” whose superpower is “being slippery,” and Angela, trying her hardest to give chase in her awkward, flapping costume; his hilarious escape into the sewers isn’t even the strangest part of this episode. </p>
      <p>The wheelchair might be gone, but not forgotten, as Laurie is getting closer to uncovering what little information Angela has gathered (a highlight of this tense scene is Regina King’s intense performance, fully visible through her mask). Will’s fingerprints reveal that he was a cop in New York during the fifties; just like Angela, Will once found himself on the side of the law and order, but switched over to something more … outlandish. </p>
      <p>Laurie, Angela and Petey are heading to the source of the mysterious car-lifting, the clock tower, and unravelling a bit of exposition along the way, with Laurie’s trauma laid bare and Angela’s trauma hinted at; something the comic firmly emphasized is that masked justice-seekers aren’t in a particularly good place, mentally. </p>
      <p>As a trillionaire, Lady Trieu seems to share the same hairstylist as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Justfuckmyshitup/comments/bho06v/a_70_billion_dollar_haircut/">Mark Zuckerburg</a>, but she also hero-worships Adrian Veidt, and seems to know that he is still alive (perhaps she’s the one who imprisoned him, rather than Manhattan?). Regardless, Trieu is the one constructing the clock tower, which is described by her mysterious daughter (who may or may not be her clone?), as “the First Wonder of the New World.” </p>
      <p>It’s also engineered to withstand extreme disasters, which isn’t suspicious at all. Trieu is definitely the new Adrian Veidt, planning some kind of major disaster to “save” mankind, and with a tragic family history in Vietnam, is likely to have a connection to Laurie’s sociopathic father, the Comedian.</p>
      <p>That dark family history is spilling into the dreams of Trieu’s daughter, an experience which is seemingly all part of whatever Trieu is planning. And, of course, Trieu is partnered with Will, who doesn’t actually need that wheelchair, presumably being kept strong and healthy by the <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/08/peter-thiel-wants-to-inject-himself-with-young-peoples-blood">blood of the young</a>, or whatever trillionaires have instead of healthcare. </p>
      <p>Trieu is frustrated by Will playing the long game with his granddaughter, although the show wouldn't be nearly as interesting if he simply told her everything. But Will is certain that whatever disastrous event they are planning will horrify Angela, so we can be certain that it involves the death of innocents. Trieu and Will seem to share little in common, other than being victims of American-made racial injustice, so their connection might just involve a Biblical payback, reparations on an Adrian Veidt-scale. </p>
      <p>Veidt himself, however, has the most deliriously weird story in this show, the man first fishing fetuses out of the local river, and taking the good specimens back to his headquarters so he can grow them into adult clone-slaves. The sound design carries the load here, envisioning the horror of rapid clone-growth that we, thankfully, don’t get to see. </p>
      <p>Through this surreal, twisted process, we learn that Veidt is not the one who created these clones, and that he is somewhat repulsed by their wretched existence, although that certainly doesn’t stop him from torturing and killing the poor things, when the mood strikes him. </p>
      <p>Doctor Manhattan did mention, once, that he wanted to create human life, but Lady Trieu seems to have her own human-farming thing going on, so it’s not yet clear who is responsible for the Veidt’s nightmarish prison. </p>
      <p>And it is a prison, not only for the poor slave-clones, but Veidt himself, his side-story a direct parallel to the Black Freighter parable that runs through the comic book, which depicts a man escaping an island on the backs of corpses. Of all the homages to the book that exist in the show, Veidt’s personal hell feels the most appropriate. </p>
      <p>With each episode, this show grows more surreal, more compelling; I’m getting a bit of a <i>Lost</i> vibe, the mystery and disorientation more interesting than any potential answers.</p>
      <p>“If You Don't Like My Story, Write Your Own,” lurches HBO’s <i>Watchmen</i> into strange sci-fi territory, far from the relative normalcy of the first episode, far from Alan Moore’s original vision, toward something bold, and unashamedly absurd. </p>
