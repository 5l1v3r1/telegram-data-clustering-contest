      <h1>Browns coach Kitchens: Benching of WR Callaway only 1 game</h1>

      <p>CLEVELAND (AP) - Browns coach Freddie Kitchens said wide receiver <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/antonio-callaway/">Antonio Callaway</a>’s benching was a one-game punishment.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/antonio-callaway/">Callaway</a> didn’t play in Sunday’s 19-16 victory over the Buffalo Bills after being a surprising healthy scratch despite quarterback Baker Mayfield saying the receiver had been included in the game plan.</p>
      <p>Kitchens did not divulge his reasons for sitting <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/antonio-callaway/">Callaway</a>, who was suspended four games earlier this season by the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-football-league/">NFL</a> for violating the league’s drug policy.</p>
      <p>On a conference call Monday, Kitchens said he wasn’t confident the 22-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/antonio-callaway/">Callaway</a> would respond to the discipline.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know if he got the message or not,” Kitchens said. “But I’m not wavering.”</p>

      <p>Kitchens said any conversations with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/antonio-callaway/">Callaway</a> will remain “between <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/antonio-callaway/">Antonio</a> and I” but added the benching “was only for yesterday.”</p>
      <p>The benching gave more playing time to wide receiver Rashard Higgins, who caught a 7-yard touchdown pass with 1:44 left as the Browns snapped a four-game losing streak.</p>
      <p>Kitchens was asked if he was disappointed or frustrated that he had to penalize <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/antonio-callaway/">Callaway</a>, given his somewhat checkered history in college and during his short time as a pro. The Browns have been patient with him.</p>
      <p>“I always want our players to make good choices,” Kitchens said. “I did what I felt like I needed to do. It’s over.”</p>
