      <p>INVERNESS, Fla. (AP) - Controversy over one Florida county commission’s response to being asked to pay for a digital subscription to the New York Times has spilled over into the local tourism realm.</p>
      <p>The Citrus County Chronicle reports people are cancelling trips to Citrus County and the repercussions are being felt as far abroad as London, England.</p>
      <p>John Pricher, director of the Citrus County Visitors Bureau, said as of Wednesday afternoon he’s received 10 anonymous and signed emails from tourists who all oppose county commissioners’ actions.</p>
      <p>In late October, commissioners discussed whether to buy the digital subscription but didn’t make a final decision. County library officials were in favor.</p>

        <p>On Nov. 19, commissioners will decide whether to take the advice of library officials and spend $2,700 annually for a digital subscription to the paper.</p>
