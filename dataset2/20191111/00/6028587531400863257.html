      <h1>Can Children Learn Science Through Dance?</h1>

      <p>How would you dance the ocean tides? That’s a question that several ten-year-old pupils at Portuguese schools have had to think about, as they took part in a pilot project that uses dance in geology education. Researchers at the Universidade do Algarve, in Faro, Portugal, recently published a paper outlining a lesson plan that integrates dance, storytelling and the geology of coastal science. The <a href="https://www.geosci-commun-discuss.net/gc-2019-21/">paper</a> was published in the journal <i>Geoscience Education</i> before peer review, but is already available to read.</p>

      <p>According to the researchers, geology education in Portuguese schools is often limited to memorization. To make the lessons more exciting, they studied contemporary models of science communication and applied this to create a series of movement exercises that are closely linked to the science of coastal geologies. In 2017, they took this lesson plan to several schools and science education events and let 112 children and their educators try it out for themselves.</p>
      <p>This geology choreography is not the only project that brings dance into the science classroom. Between 2010 and 2015 the University of Houston spearheaded a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14647893.2018.1550477">project</a> at a charter school – closely linked to the university – to support teachers with the integration of dance in science lessons in grades ranging from Kindergarten to fifth grade. They arranged professional development workshops to give the teachers the basic knowledge they needed to confidently use dance in their lessons. For example, these workshops taught teachers a vocabulary to describe certain movements, which helped them talk about dance in a more practical way.  </p>
      <p>The University of Houston dance and education program faculty that were involved with this project also recently published a paper, looking back at <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14647893.2018.1550477">what they learned</a> after five years of providing dance support for teachers. They had interviewed all the teachers who took part, and carefully analyzed each interview to find common topics.</p>
      <p>Overall, the teachers had a good experience using dance to teach science. They said that they had noticed students taking ownership of their ideas and asking pointed questions about the scientific material underlying the dance. One teacher said,  “I have certainly seen them go more deeply into questioning themselves when they are performing the dance; they come up with all kinds of questions.”</p>
      <p>The teachers also found that dancing promoted social interaction and collaboration among their students, much more than a regular lesson would. And that is also exactly what a third group of researchers noticed, who also recently published a study about dancing in the classroom. Education researchers at the University of Roehampton, UK, specifically <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2059204319881852">found</a> that using dance in school lessons helped students on the autism spectrum better socialize with their (neurotypical) classmates. Likewise, the Portuguese <a href="https://www.geosci-commun-discuss.net/gc-2019-21/">study</a> also found that the dance project allowed students with a variety of diagnoses, such as ADD, dyslexia or autism, to take part in the lesson with their peers.</p>
      <p>All three recent research studies suggest that incorporating dance in primary school lessons can improve the way that students interact with each other, and make them more engaged with what they’re learning, but that leaves an important question: Are students who dance in a science lesson really learning science?</p>
      <p>The teachers involved in the project in Houston did notice that their students were particularly motivated to incorporate correct science in their dance, which encouraged them to learn about the underlying topics. They also thought that dancing helped the students internalize what they had learned.</p>
      <p>However, one of the challenges they had was finding enough time. They now not only had to teach the science concepts themselves, but also find time to introduce and coordinate the dance project.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, in Portugal, the project left organizers with no clear insight in whether their dance had helped students better understand coastal geology, but according to the researchers, that was not the purpose of the study.  Rather, they wanted to introduce a way for students to be more engaged with the subject material they learn about in science classes.</p>
      <p>After all, they argue, it was more valuable to give students and teachers a way to connect more directly and meaningfully with scientists – such as the ones who visited the schools to organize the dance activity – than to enforce rote memorization of facts.</p>
      <p>In a few years, these students may not remember the exact scientific names of geological phenomena, but they will definitely remember that time they met a scientist who came to dance with them about the sea.</p>
