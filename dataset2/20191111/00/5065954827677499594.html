      <p>A VISIONARY. A boss who never tired of making “constant casual, intimate dialogues” with ordinary workers in the various companies he founded and built into major concerns. This was how John Gokongwei Jr., was remembered late Sunday by Malacañang and the country’s biggest trade union group as the passing of “Mr. John” was announced by his family.</p>
      <p>At least two senators also hailed his legacy. Sen. Aquilino “Koko” Pimentel III said, “I pay tribute to one of the greatest business leaders and philanthropists of our time. Mr. Gokongwei will truly be remembered for his selfless advocacies and contributions to the Philippines, be it corporate or charity work.”</p>

      <p>Senate President Pro Tempore Ralph Recto said, “Mr. John was a national flag carrier who planted Filipino greatness in other lands and in the minds of his people that yes, a poor <i>promdi</i> like him can.” Recto was referring to Gokongwei’s humble origins in Cebu, the home province he loved with passion, and after which his leading carrier, Cebu Pacific, was named.</p>
      <p>“We can tally the jobs his business created, the taxes paid, and the earnings it generated, but the inspiration he gave our young was the most important bottomline that was hard to quantify,” said Recto.</p>
      <p>“He pushed the envelope and challenged convention in everything he did because this summa cum laude of the university of hard knocks believed that excellence can only be achieved by human talent pushed to the limit,” the senator added.</p>
      <p>“Everything about Mr. John was big—vision, dreams, kindness—yet he never tired of punching above his weight, and the obstacles he toppled paved the way for others.</p>
      <p>“But this taipan was also a colossus of generosity. Sans fanfare, he funded schools and scholarships, so that poverty will not interrupt schooling the way it did his. He spoke softly but wrote large checks,” Recto added.</p>
      <p>Gokongwei, who built an empire that spanned property, power, retail, air transportation, hospitality, media, telecom-munications, banking and food, died peacefully late Saturday (November 9) at the age of 93, his family announced early on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“Our beloved husband, father and grandfather John Gokongwei Jr. passed away peacefully 11:41 p.m. November 9th, at the Manila Doctors Hospital surrounded by his loved ones. Please pray for the repose of his soul. Details of his wake to follow. Rest in peace, Mr. John,” said an SMS from his son Lance Gokongwei, sent to Esquire Philippines.</p>
      <p>The patriarch had passed on the helm of his diverse businesses to his children many years ago. Lance is chief executive officer of Cebu Pacific, while his sister Robina Gokongwei-Pe oversees the retail side as CEO of Robinsons Retail. Their sister Lisa Gokongwei-Cheng heads Summit Media.</p>
      <p>Lance, groomed early on by his father to steer the business, is president and CEO of the holding firm JG Summit. His uncle James Go is chairman and chief operating officer there.</p>
      <p>Gokongwei has consistently landed on <i>Forbes</i>’ list of the Philippines’s richest men. In the latest listing, he was ranked third richest. His estimated net worth is $5.8 billion.</p>
      <h3>Giving back</h3>
      <p>When he turned 80, he donated half of his shares in JG Summit—estimated at P20 billion the—to the family foundation, saying he wanted to give back to people after being blessed so much. In a statement, Presidential Spokesman and Chief Presidential Legal Counsel Salvador S. Panelo called Gokongwei a “visionary” and a “pillar of the Philippine economy.”</p>
      <p>Even the union heads who organized the workers in some of his companies remembered him well. “Mr. Gokongwei is best remembered by employees with his constant casual, intimate dialogues with them with particular interest on their well-being working in the Gokongwei family-owned company,” said Raymond Mendoza, national president of the Associated Labor Unions-Trade Union Congress of the Philippines (ALU-TUCP). “Employees will certainly miss these boss-and-subordinates conversations.”</p>
      <p>ALU has affiliate unions at the Universal Robina Corp. and the Cebu Pacific, which are subsidiaries of Gokongwei-founded JG Summit Holdings Inc.</p>
