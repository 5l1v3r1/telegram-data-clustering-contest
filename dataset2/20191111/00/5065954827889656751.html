      <p>THE Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) is seriously considering the imposition of a safeguard measure on imported vehicles, targeting mostly units coming from Thailand and Indonesia, to compel automotive manufacturers to locate operations and create jobs here.</p>
      <p>Trade Undersecretary Ceferino S. Rodolfo said the DTI is studying option of applying tariff on vehicle imports from Southeast Asian economies—enjoying duty-free privilege at present—and raising the rate for those shipped from outside the region. He said the move was triggered by the petition filed by trade union Philippine Metalworkers’ Alliance (PMA), which lamented the declining employment in the automotive industry, particularly in manufacturing.</p>
      <p>“The DTI, through the Bureau of Import Services, is assessing the application for safeguard duty on imported automobiles filed by the [PMA],” Rodolfo told reporters last week.</p>
      <p>According to Rodolfo, PMA lodged the petition to impose a safeguard measure on automobile to stop the alleged import surge of the product. Car makers are reportedly choosing Thailand and Indonesia as their investment destinations in Southeast Asia, as they can just ship units to the Philippines at zero duty under the region’s trade deal.</p>
      <p>Citing official data, Rodolfo disclosed that vehicle imports last year rose to over 207,000 units, from about 153,000 units in 2014, the bulk of which came from Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea.</p>
      <p>When the 2014-to-2018 imports are combined, the trade official said this will total to around 1 million units. Government data reported to the International Trade Centre showed the country’s cumulative imports during the five-year period amounted to $16.26 billion.</p>
      <p>Shipments from Thailand reached an estimated 428,000 units, valued at $6.73 billion, while those from Indonesia totaled around 312,000 units, summing $5.09 billion.</p>
      <p>“If you look at it, there appears to be a surge. I cannot yet definitively say that there is because it’s under evaluation,” Rodolfo said.</p>
      <p>The PMA claimed this alleged import surge is affecting its member-workers, as the decision of vehicle assemblers to locate their business in Thailand and Indonesia is reducing employment opportunities in the Philippines.</p>
      <p>Based on records from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), there are 7,784 direct workers in the motor vehicle manufacturing sector in 2014. However, this plunged 12.1 percent in 2015 to 6,842 workers, before slipping yet again in 2016 by 3.33 percent to 6,614 workers.</p>
      <p>The PSA also reported the number of establishments involved in motor vehicle manufacturing fell to 48 in 2015, from 56 in 2014, before recovering to 52 in 2016.</p>
      <p>“They [member-workers of PMA] are getting hit. Their membership [belongs to] a broad alliance of [workers in the] automotive, iron and steel, electronic and electrical sectors, including in key automotive industry players,” <br/>Rodolfo said.</p>
      <p>The trade official explained the DTI is seriously considering the petition to impose safeguard on imported vehicles, as the government is now maximizing the use of trade remedies to protect its industries from import influx.</p>
      <p>Rodolfo said the Philippines applied for just two antidumping measures between 2010 and 2017, the lowest in Southeast Asia when compared with Indonesia’s 28, Thailand’s 28, Malaysia’s 23, and Vietnam’s seven. Manila also made use of safeguard measures only twice during the seven-year period as against Jakarta’s 14, Bangkok’s four, Hanoi’s four and Kuala Lumpur’s three.</p>
      <p>“If you look at the [records], we rarely use trade remedies. We have been very prudent, while those implemented by other countries reach 20,” Rodolfo argued. “We are not filing [safeguard] even if this is a legitimate trade measure that is allowed in the WTO [World Trade Organization].”</p>
