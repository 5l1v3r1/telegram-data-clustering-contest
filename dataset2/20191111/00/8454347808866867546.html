      <p>Disney+ has the potential to utterly change the streaming market. First hinted at several years ago and announced in 2017, Disney’s bid to enter the field seemed to spur on its quest to purchase the 20th Century Fox assets and separate itself from Netflix.</p>
      <p>One potentially important difference, depending on the details, is price: $6.99. Netflix’s lowest tier is available at $8.99 (one screen at a time with standard definition). Also, at launch, Disney+ will be available to U.S. consumers in a bundle with ad-supported Hulu and ESPN+ for $12.99 per month, <a href="https://www.thewaltdisneycompany.com/disneys-q3-fy19-earnings-results-webcast/">CEO Bob Iger announced in a Walt Disney Company earnings call</a> on August 6 — that is, the same as the mid-tier pricing plan for Netflix (watch on two screens at a time with HD available and video downloads available on two phones or tablets). Netflix’s premium plan is priced at $15.99 per month.</p>
      <p>Now that the platform will launch in just a few months, the shape of Disney+ at launch is becoming clearer – as is its roadmap for the first few years of its life. With competitive pricing, key feature-film brands, and an impressive library, Disney’s streaming service could become a major competitor to Netflix. And now with Fox in the family, the potential is even bigger. Come take a look at what we know about Disney+ and how it might change your viewing habits in the 2020s.</p>

      <h3>Disney+’s Price and Launch Date</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Starting November 12, 2019, subscribers can enjoy 7,500 episodes of both current and concluded TV shows (like <i>The Simpsons</i>), 25 original series — including <i>Star Wars</i> series <i>The Mandalorian</i> at launch — 10 original movies and specials, 100 recently-released Disney theatrical films, and 400 movies from Disney’s library for $6.99 a month (or a yearly price of $69.99). That price point will definitely make people give Disney+ a try. Then there is the bundle with Hulu and ESPN+ at $12.99, giving subscribers a whole lot to love about this new streaming service.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Consumers can subscribe to Disney+ directly at DisneyPlus.com or via in-app purchase from the following partner platforms and devices (dependent on country):</li>

      <h3>Disney+ Will Be Home Disney’s Family Programming, Including Pixar Films</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/16131015/InsideOut.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <p>The service will focus on the more family-friendly aspects of the Disney empire, including its Pixar Animation Studios films. Other film content includes the <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/franchise/marvel_cinematic_universe">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a>, <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/franchise/star_wars_saga"><i>Star Wars</i></a> movies, and the animated library of the Walt Disney Studio itself. The “entire Pixar library,” all “animated Disney classics from the vault,” and more recent features like <i>Moana</i> and <i>Frozen</i> debut on the platform across the first year, Kevin Mayer, Disney chairman of Direct-to-Consumer &amp; International, explained at the service’s D23 presentation in August. He also mentioned that movies like <i>Bedknobs and Broomsticks</i> will also be available alongside 5,000 episodes of Disney Channel and Disney Jr. content. And once on the service, this material will be there “permanently,” according to Mayer.</p>
      <p>The potential here is huge, especially when one considers just how vast Disney’s film and television holdings really are. Beyond the obvious <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/franchise/pixar">Pixar</a>, Marvel, Lucasfilm, and Disney animation content, there is the wealth of ABC family sitcoms, older archival material from the ’50s and ’60s, and even PG material from 20th Century Fox, including PG-13 <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/avatar"><i>Avatar</i></a>. Not all of it will be available at launch, of course, but the content Disney+ will contain is staggering. So whether your nostalgia compels you to watch <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/that_s_so_raven"><i>That’s So Raven</i></a>, <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/malcolm_in_the_middle"><i>Malcolm in the Middle</i></a>, or the odd episode of <i>The Wonder World of Color</i>, Disney+ will eventually have you covered.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Disney’s less family-friendly material will likely find a home at Hulu, which Disney now controls after agreeing to buy Comcast’s stake in the service. Expect the <i>Alien</i> films and classic Fox fare like <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dr_dolittle"><i>Dr. Dolittle</i></a> and <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1004329-cleopatra"><i>Cleopatra</i></a> to appear on that service before too long.</p>

      <h3>Disney+ Will Feature at Least Three Star Wars Shows</h3>
      <h4>The Mandalorian</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/23105523/the-mandalorian-key-art-700x380.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>(Photo by Disney+)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>As streaming services will need “killer app”–style content at launch from now on, Disney+’s first announced exclusive series is <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_mandalorian"><i>The Mandalorian</i></a>, a stand-alone <i>Star Wars</i> series from <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/iron_man"><i>Iron Man</i></a> director <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/jon_favreau">Jon Favreau</a>. As he previously revealed, the series will feature all-new characters making their way in the galaxy after the fall of the Empire in <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/star_wars_episode_vi_return_of_the_jedi"><i>Return of the Jedi</i></a>, but before The First Order’s deadly attack on the New Republic in <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/star_wars_episode_vii_the_force_awakens"><i>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</i></a>. Into that milieu, audiences will discover a Mandalorian gunfighter operating on the Outer Rim, where the worries of the New Republic barely exist and violence still forms the rule of law.</p>
      <p><i>The Mandalorian</i> will star <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/pedro_pascal">Pedro Pascal</a>, <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/gina_carano">Gina Carano</a>, <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/giancarlo_esposito">Giancarlo Esposito</a>, <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/emily_swallow">Emily Swallow</a>, <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/carl_weathers">Carl Weathers</a>, <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/omid_abtahi">Omid Abtahi</a>, <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/werner_herzog">Werner Herzog</a>, and <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/nick_nolte">Nick Nolte</a>, according to <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/pedro-pascal-revealed-as-the-mandalorian">StarWars.com</a>’s official announcement. <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/dave-filoni">Dave Filoni</a> (<i>Star Wars: The Clone Wars</i>, <i>Star Wars Rebels</i>) is directing the first episode (and executive producing alongside Lucasfilm president <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/kathleen_kennedy">Kathleen Kennedy</a> and <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/1053102-colin_wilson">Colin Wilson</a>), while other directors will include <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/deborah_chow">Deborah Chow</a> (<i>Jessica Jones</i>), <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/rick_famuyiwa">Rick Famuyiwa</a> (<i>Dope</i>), <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/bryce_dallas_howard">Bryce Dallas Howard</a> (<i>Solemates</i>), and <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/taika_waititi">Taika Waititi</a> (<i>Thor: Ragnarok</i>).</p>

      <h4>Untitled Obi-Wan Kenobi Series</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/15174531/ewan-mcgregor-obi-wan-kenobi-700x380.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <p>In August, multiple outlets reported that <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/ewan_mcgregor">Ewan McGregor</a> was in talks to potentially return to the franchise as Obi-Wan Kenobi, reprising his role in a limited series on the streaming service after a potential prequel film about the character fell apart in 2017. The event series could consist of up to six episodes, according to original source <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/star-wars-ewan-mcgregor-talks-an-obi-wan-kenobi-series-disney-1201364">StarWarsNews.net</a>. McGregor famously took over the role of Ben Kenobi in the <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/franchise/star_wars_saga"><i>Star Wars</i></a> prequels from <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/alec_guinness">Alec Guinness</a>, who played Luke Skywalker’s Jedi mentor in the original trilogy.</p>
      <p>McGregor appeared on the D23 stage to confirm the rumors with a simple “yes.” The series will be set in a time contemporaneous with the events of <i>Solo: A Star Wars Story</i>, according to a timeline shown during the D23 presentation.</p>
      <p>“We are really close, we have all the scripts written, we are ready to start shooting next year,” Kennedy said.</p>

        <figcaption>(Photo by Jesse Grant/Getty Images for Disney)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>McGregor added that after four years of starts and stops, it was wonderful to finally say he was back.</p>
      <p>The new series takes place eight years after the events of <i>Revenge of the Sith</i>, where we last saw Obi-Wan delivering the infant Luke Skywalker to his Tatooine homestead, <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/the-galaxy-far-far-away-just-got-a-little-bigger">StarWars.com reported</a>.</p>
      <p>At the end of September, <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/deborah-chow-obi-wan-kenobi-series">StarWars.com also announced</a> that Deborah Chow, who directed episodes of <i>The Mandalorian</i>, will helm the series.</p>
      <p>“We really wanted to select a director who is able to explore both the quiet determination and rich mystique of Obi-Wan in a way that folds seamlessly into the Star Wars saga,” Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy said. “Based on her phenomenal work developing our characters in The Mandalorian, I’m absolutely confident Deborah is the right director to tell this story.”</p>
      <p>The series will be written by Hossein Amini (<i>The Alienist</i>, <i>Drive</i>). Chow, Amini, and McGregor will serve as executive producers alongside Kennedy, Tracey Seaward (<i>The Queen</i>), and John Swartz (<i>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story</i>). Lucasfilm’s Executive Vice President Production Jason McGatlin will serve as co-producer.</p>

      <h4>Untitled Cassian Andor Series</h4>

        <figcaption>(Photo by Walt Disney Pictures/Lucasfilm)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The second series, which has not yet been named, will feature <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rogue_one_a_star_wars_story"><i>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story</i></a>’s Diego Luna reprising his role as Rebel spy Cassian Andor. <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/alan_tudyk">Alan Tudyk</a> will also return as Cassian’s droll droid accomplice K-2SO. Considering the events of <i>Rogue One</i>, the series will be a prequel to that film and chart his earlier operations with the still-growing Rebel Alliance.</p>
      <p>During the Disney+ presentation at D23, Kennedy referred to the program as a “spy series,” suggesting a certain tone for the production. As it is a prequel to <i>Rogue One</i>, Luna quipped “we’re going to look younger” and said the first season will be “10 hours or more.”</p>
      <hr/>

      </figure>
      <p>The service will also be the exclusive home of <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/star_wars_the_clone_wars"><i>Star Wars: The Clone Wars</i></a>’ seventh season. The animated series was something of a victim of Lucasfilm’s transition into the Disney family, but its dedicated fanbase was happy to learn it would continue on Disney+ when executive producer Dave Filoni announced its return at Comic-Con back in 2018. The new season will debut in February 2020.</p>
      <p>Each show illustrates Disney’s dedication to the <i>Star Wars</i> brand and the understanding that programs set in that universe will get people to subscribe.</p>

      <h3>Avengers Heroes Loki, Scarlet Witch, Vision, Falcon, and Winter Soldier Will Star in Their Own Disney+ Series</h3>

      <p>Marvel Studios will enter the television format for the first time on Disney+ by producing a number of limited series set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. And with Marvel Studios CEO <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/kevin-feige">Kevin Feige</a>’s promotion to Chief Creative Officer of Marvel, the television and film offerings will be more entwined than ever before. The initial three series developed for the platform are key components of the MCU’s Phase 4 timeline. Additionally, Feige recently clarified characters from the forthcoming She-Hulk, Moon Knight, and Ms. Marvel series will make their way into Marvel movies after they debut on Disney+. As someone once said, “It’s all connected,” and the Disney+ series will be required viewing for Marvel fans.</p>

      <p><b>RELATED:</b> “<a href="https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/most-memorable-movie-moments-avengers-infinity-war-snap/">21 Most Memorable Movie Moments: The Snap from Avengers: Infinity War (2018)</a>”</p>
      <hr/>
      <h4>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</h4>
      <p>The first of these will be <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_falcon_and_the_winter_soldier/s01"><i>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</i></a> starring <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/anthony_mackie">Anthony Mackie</a> and <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/sebastian_stan">Sebastian Stan</a> in the title roles. Picking up from the events of <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>, the series will reportedly deal with Sam (Mackie) deciding to pick up the shield and name Steve Rogers (<a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/chris_evans">Chris Evans</a>) gave him in the film’s closing moments. <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/emily_vancamp">Emily VanCamp</a> will return as Sharon Carter, while <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/daniel_bruehl">Daniel Brühl</a> will reprise his role as Zemo, the man who brought down the Avengers in <i>Captain America: Civil War</i>, while Wyatt Russell will play John Walker — the U.S. Agent of Marvel Comics fame. Will he stoke the flames of unrest around the Falcon’s ascendancy as the new Cap? The series, which began production in the first full week of November 2019, is set to debut in August 2020.</p>
      <h4>WandaVision</h4>
      <p>Next will be <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/wandavision/s01"><i>WandaVision</i></a> with <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/elizabeth_olsen">Elizabeth Olsen</a> returning as Wanda Maximoff – aka the Scarlet Witch – and <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/paul_bettany">Paul Bettany</a> as Vision. But how can this be? Vision died in <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> and was not one of the lucky ones revived during the Second Snap. Olsen once said the series will see Wanda and Vision in a “1950s” setting, which suggests the series may be taking its cues from the 2015 Vision comic book series. In that story by Tom King and Gabriel Walta, Vision created his own ideal nuclear family. It goes very wrong. At the D23 presentation, writer Jac Schaeffer said the show will be “half-sitcom” and “half MCU adventure.” A video revealing <i>The Dick Van Dyke Show</i> as a major influence only strengthened the impression that Wanda may be wishing herself into another genre altogether. And whatever Wanda does to make her own idyllic life, a grown up Monica Rambeau (played by <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/teyonah_parris">Teyonah Parris</a>) will be there to bring her back to the present. At D23, Feige announced Kat Dennings had joined the cast — reprising her role as <i>Thor</i>’s Darcy Lewis — with Randall Park also reprising his role as <i>Ant-Man and the Wasp</i>’s Agent Jimmy Woo. And to accent the sitcom feel, Kathryn Hahn will play the “nosey neighbor” in that laugh track reality. The events of the series will tie directly to the upcoming film <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/doctor_strange_in_the_multiverse_of_madness"><i>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</i></a>, which will also feature Olsen. The series, reportedly also in production, will arrive on Disney+ in early 2021.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h4>Loki</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/08200155/Loki-Lead.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>(Photo by Walt Disney Pictures)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/tom-hiddleston">Tom Hiddleston</a> will return as the God of Mischief in the 2021 limited series <i>Loki</i>. The story will follow the Loki who escaped from custody in <i>Endgame</i> with a divergent copy of the Space Stone. It seems he will also get access to time travel as early photos see Loki in a 1970s New York. Divergent timelines are a hell of thing and this will presumably be the series to examine what it means for the MCU going forward. Also, Feige recently mentioned the series will create repercussions that will be felt in <i>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</i>, further strengthening the ties between the Disney+ programs and the films.</p>
      <h4>What If …?</h4>
      <p>Marvel Studios will also provide Disney+ with an animated series. Based on the classic Marvel Comics title <i>What If …?</i>, each animated segment will address a different outcome to key MCU events – probably through the lens of those pesky divergent timelines. As an example, the first episode will ask “What if Peggy Carter took the super solider serum instead of Steve Rogers?” The answer will feature the voice of <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/hayley_atwell">Hayley Atwell</a> as a super-strong Agent Carter and, presumably, the voice of Evans as a 98-lb Steve who becomes the first Iron Man thanks to Howard Stark. Tying the series together will be <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/jeffrey_wright">Jeffrey Wright</a> as Uatu the Watcher, the host of the <i>What If …?</i> comic book and the viewer’s guide into the strangest of the Marvel series for the streaming service, which will debut in mid 2021.</p>
      <h4>Hawkeye</h4>
      <p><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/jeremy_renner">Jeremy Renner</a> will play Clint Barton once more in <i>Hawkeye</i>. The last of the Phase 4 Disney+ series will see Clint meeting and training a new Hawkeye named Kate Bishop. The part has not yet been cast, but the character is a fan favorite from comic books like <i>Young Avengers</i> and her own <i>Hawkeye</i> comics. It will premiere in 2021.</p>
      <h4>Ms. Marvel</h4>
      <p>Based on the Kamala Khan character created in 2013 by Sana Amanat, Stephen Wacker, G. Willow Wilson, and Adrian Alphona, the series will introduce the popular teen Inhuman to the MCU. And as Feige put it, “You will meet her in her Disney+ series and see her in our films.” A commitment to what <i>Ms. Marvel</i> fans have wanted for ages.</p>
      <h4>Moon Knight</h4>
      <p>The subject of many rumors during Marvel’s alliance with Netflix, Disney+ will serve as home to a <i>Moon Knight</i> series. As Feige explained, it is an “action adventure series” featuring the Marvel character Mark Specter. “He was left for dead and he may or may not be infused with powers from the moon god,” he explained “Or he might be crazy.”</p>
      <h4>She-Hulk</h4>
      <p>But in a move which thrilled the D23 audience, Feige revealed <i>She-Hulk</i> will join the Disney+ lineup. “Bruce Banner is no longer the only Hulk in the MCU. She’s a Hulk and she’s a lawyer,” Feige said.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Outside of Marvel and <i>Star Wars</i>, Disney+ will rely on some of its best-known properties to entice Disney fans into subscribing. Series based on <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/monsters_inc"><i>Monsters Inc.</i></a> and <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mighty_ducks"><i>The Mighty Ducks</i></a> are both in development. A new version of <i><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/high_school_musical">High School Musical</a></i> based around one school’s production of <i>High School Musical</i>, is also on its way.</p>
      <p>A new Muppets short-form series, <i>Muppets Now</i>, will see the Jim Henson characters in new, “unscripted” situations.</p>
      <p><i>Monsters at Work</i> stars Ben Feldman as a recent graduate of Monsters University — he graduated scareum-cum-laude — who goes to work at Monsters Inc. on the day it switches from scaring kids to making them laugh; a skill set he definitely lacks. Aisha Tyler also stars as his mother.</p>
      <p>The service will also feature a revived <i>Lizzie McGuire</i> series with Hilary Duff reprising her role from the original Disney Channel series. Lizzie is about to turn 30, but that animated teenager is still bouncing around in her head. Original creator Terri Minsky is also on board.</p>
      <p>And for fans of Disney history, the service will also feature <i>Ink &amp; Paint</i>, a docu-series centered on the women who “made many of the Disney animated classics possible with little or no recognition for their work” as members of the studio’s Ink &amp; Paint department. Another untitled docu-series is also in the works.</p>

      <p>In the realm of features, Disney+ will be the exclusive home of the upcoming <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lady_and_the_tramp"><i>Lady and the Tramp</i></a> live-action remake. <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/tessa_thompson">Tessa Thompson</a> and <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/justin_theroux">Justin Theroux</a> will voice the title roles, with <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/yvette_nicole_brown">Yvette Nicole Brown</a>, <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/benedict-wong">Benedict Wong</a>, and <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/janelle_monae">Janelle Monáe</a> set to lend their talents to the production.</p>
      <p>The service will also revive Touchstone’s <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sister_act"><i>Sister Act</i></a> series with a third installment, although, according to <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/whoopi_goldberg">Whoopi Goldberg</a>, her participation may be limited to a walk-on cameo as the film takes the concept of a witness hiding in a convent in another direction. <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/insecure"><i>Insecure</i></a>‘s Regina Hicks and <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/star"><i>Star</i></a>‘s Karin Gist are developing the feature for Disney.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the service will mine the 20th Century Fox library. During the August 6 earnings call, Iger revealed plans to develop new versions of <i>Home Alone</i>, <i>Night At the Museum</i>, <i>Cheaper By the Dozen</i>, and <i>Diary of a Wimpy Kid</i>. It is unclear if they will be a television series or feature-length Disney+ original films, but Iger said each property will be “re-imagined for a new generation.” And thanks to Disney acquisition of the Fox assets, it will also offer 600 hours of National Geographic content at launch.</p>

      <h3>Disney+ Will Also Offer Totally New Original Films and Series</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>While it makes sense for Disney to lean heavily on its proven stable of intellectual property, Disney+ has acquired a number of films and put several series in development based on concepts new to the corporation, like <i>Diary of a Female President</i>. Created by <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/crazy_ex_girlfriend"><i>Crazy Ex-Girlfriend</i></a> veteran Ilana Peña, it will center on a 12-year-old Cuban-American girl on a mission to become the president of the United States. Of course, she has to survive middle school first. The series already has a 10-episode commitment.</p>
      <p>Recent <i>Toy Story 4</i> breakout star Forky (Tony Hale) will star in his own short-form series, <i>Forky Asks a Question</i>, in which he will explore important questions about how the world works, such as “What is love?” and “What is time?”</p>
      <p>The service is also said to be developing a comedy series called <i>Four Dads</i> about a gay couple who divorce, marry other people, and find they still need to spend time together as they raise their pre-teen daughters.</p>
      <p>The film slate includes <i>Noelle</i>, in which <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/anna-kendrick">Anna Kendrick</a> plays Santa Claus’s daughter Noelle. <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/bill-hader">Bill Hader</a>, <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/billy_eichner">Billy Eichner</a>, and <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/shirley_maclaine">Shirley MacLaine</a> also star. Originally set to be released theatrically next November, it joined the Disney+ roster last year.</p>
      <p>The often-delayed <i>Magic Camp</i> will also find a home on Disney+. Directed by Mark Waters, the film stars <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/adam_devine">Adam DeVine</a> as a magician who takes a job counseling at a magic-oriented youth camp in the hopes of reigniting his career.</p>
      <p><i>Stargirl</i> – not to be confused with the upcoming DC Universe series of the same name – will also land on the platform. Based on the novel by Jerry Spinelli, it tells the tale of Stargirl Caraway (<a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/grace_vanderwaal">Grace VanderWaal</a>), a homeschooled teen who shakes things up when she enrolls in an Arizona high school.</p>
      <p>At D23, Disney+ previewed two new features set to premiere exclusively on the service. <i>Timmy Failure: Mistakes Were Made</i>, directed by Tom McCarthy, follows the exploits of a quirky, deadpan hero, Timmy Failure, who, along with his 1,500-pound polar bear partner Total, operates Total Failure Inc., a Portland detective agency. <i>Togo</i>, meanwhile, stars Willem DeFoe as a man who must journey through the Arctic with only his most spirited sled dog at his side.</p>
      <p>And, finally, Disney+ is developing a feature based on Polly Shulman’s YA series <i>The Grimm Legacy</i>, which follows a group of teenagers who work at a library specializing in arcane materials uniquely suited to characters from the Grimm fairy tales. <i><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/tolkien">Tolkien</a> </i>screenwriter David Gleeson will write the script.</p>

      <h3>The Starting Lineup</h3>
      <figure>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/chC8qr_9HuQ" width="640" height="360" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <p>In addition to <i>The Simpsons</i> and <i>The Mandalorian</i>, other specific content you can expect on launch day includes all of the Marvel Studios films except for <i>Thor: Ragnarok</i>, <i>Black Panther</i>, <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i>, <i>Ant-Man and the Wasp</i>, the two MCU <i>Spider-Man</i> films, and <i>The Incredible Hulk</i>. All but those latter three — which feature characters shared by other studios — are expected to make their way to the service within the first year. The <i>Marvel’s Hero Project</i> reality series will also debut during the service’s launch.</p>
      <p>All Pixar films, aside from the recently released <i>Toy Story 4</i>, will be available at launch, but expect <i>Toy Story 4</i> to join its brethren by early 2020.</p>
      <p><i>Star Wars</i> fans will be able to watch all of the live-action films except <i>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</i> and <i>Solo: A Star Wars Story</i>. (Feel free to snark about those omissions in the comments below.) On the TV end of the galaxy, all of <i>Star Wars Rebels</i> and the extant seasons of <i>Star Wars: The Clone Wars</i> will be available in addition to <i>Mandalorian</i>.</p>
      <p>Outside of the company’s big IP farms, <i>The World According to Jeff Goldblum</i> and the <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/kristen_bell">Kristen Bell</a>–produced <i>Encore!</i> will also on November 12.</p>
      <p>Disney film library content will be quite robust, with films like <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/tron"><i>Tron</i></a>, <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lilo_and_stitch"><i>Lilo &amp; Stitch</i></a>, <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/101_dalmatians"><i>101 </i><i>Dalmatians</i></a>, the new version of <i>The Lady and the Tramp</i>, and the film that started it all, <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1048445-snow_white_and_the_seven_dwarfs"><i>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</i></a>, all available at launch. Television library highlights include the original <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/ducktales_1987"><i>DuckTales</i></a> series and the <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/ducktales/s01">first season of the current revamp</a>, the aforementioned <i>Simpsons</i>, and <i>Malcolm in the Middl</i>e, proving integration of Fox properties was always a priority for the service.</p>
      <p>As Iger put it, the launch day lineup will be “significant in quality.”</p>
      <p>See “<a href="https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/disney-streaming-service-price-new-shows-movies-launch-date-package-details-more/#launchlist">The Launch List</a>” below for the full roster of film and show titles.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Disney’s BAMTech Subsidiary Is Building the Platform</h3>
      <p>In August 2017, Disney bought a controlling interest in BAMTech, LLC, a technology firm specializing in streaming service apps like HBO Now.</p>
      <p>According to Iger, the Disney+ platform will feature “elegant navigation” and ways to personalize content. Which, considering the way Netflix hides personalized watch lists these days, may be a bigger competitive feature than currently thought.</p>
      <p>In fact, that “elegant navigation” may be more of a selling point as streaming services tend to follow the Netflix model. If Disney can reinvent navigating to content — especially for the company’s vast library — it could prove to be a compelling way to pull people away from their chief rival in the streaming sphere.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>While Disney+ will become <i>the </i>service for <i>Star Wars</i> and Marvel fans, it will also indicate the market’s future as other corporations make moves to silo content on their own services and Netflix plans for a future in which most of its content is home-grown. But with its strong brand recognition and library – to say nothing of the price – it may quickly become the leader in streaming services.</p>
