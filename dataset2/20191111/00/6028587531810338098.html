      <p>The needs and desires of younger consumers have continued to evolve. In recent years, more attention has been placed on these consumers, what they value and how businesses can cater to their ever-changing tastes, yet much of this information remains elusive to business owners. It should come as no surprise to anyone that Generation Z (Gen Z) is the most impatient generation. This generation is the fastest to hang up while on hold, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161215005275/en/Generation-Consumers-Impatient-Quickest-to-Curse-Call-Businesses-of%C2%A0Any">research</a> indicates. This same research found that Gen Z is more likely to hang up if the phone is not answered within 45 seconds—this generation wants fast and responsive customer service. Many industries are failing to meet the expectations of Gen Z consumers, given the long wait and hold times for most businesses. A <a href="https://info.lightico.com/hubfs/Banks-Onboarding-Millennials.pdf">survey</a> found that 40% of the young consumers who attempted to apply for an online bank account abandoned the process because it was too lengthy, authentication was too time consuming, and the forms were difficult to fill out. One <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-average-american-will-spend-43-days-of-his-life-on-hold-2016-02-04?link=MW_popular">study</a> found that the average American spends 10-20 minutes per week or about 43 days of the average lifetime waiting on hold. This is particularly problematic given the vast amount of Gen Z buying power. In 2020, Gen Z will make up <a href="https://www.visioncritical.com/blog/generation-z-statistics">40%</a> of all consumers in the U.S. “[Gen Z] wants instant experiences,” indicates <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zviki-ben-ishay-7406187/?originalSubdomain=il">Zviki Ben-Ishay</a>, chief executive officer of <a href="https://www.lightico.com/">Lightico</a>. Lightico is a company that was created to “empower businesses to create streamlined experiences throughout the customer journey.” The company focuses on simplifying customer interactions with businesses. In order to simplify this process, it is absolutely necessary to first understand what customers want—particularly the next generation of consumers. “[Gen Z] wants convenience, and they want everything done from their mobile [phone]. They can’t take their eyes off their mobile device…PCs and laptops are only for work…they would like their processes and their time be well served,” Ben-Ishay reveals.</p>

      <p>What are companies missing when it comes to Gen Z consumers? “Eventually [Gen Z] becomes loyal only to businesses that are providing that simplicity and delighting experience,” Ben-Ishay notes. “A lot of students from [this generation] don’t even know where they can find a fax; they’ve never owned a printer. Those tedious applications, those tedious tasks that are being requested from businesses out there are so far away from them that they’re creating a very big gap between the businesses and this generation…you can’t tell a person that signs up for Netflix or for Amazon or who buys something in one click to install your mobile app in order to join the bank account, or arrive to the branch in order to verify their identification, or to open their email in order to sign a document. It’s just too hard for them…it ruins their loyalty with that business.”</p>
      <p>So how do businesses create a customer service experience that doesn’t turn their Gen Z consumers off? Convenience might be the key to a loyal Gen Z customer; this generation is <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/275647">accustomed to convenience</a> more than any other. Ben-Ishay encourages businesses to focus on four components in order to attract and retain Gen Z consumers. “Instant experiences, intuitive, convenient, mobile…[Gen Z] want those experiences to be flawless…make sure you can provide a mobile experience with <i>no</i> applications…you need to gain their trust before they give you that real estate in their digital life. Use convenience…all of those will get you loyalty from those customers. When [Gen Z] experience this instant and intuitive experience, they give back business…but the moment that you fail to provide those experiences, they lose their loyalty so it’s something that you need to maintain.” Companies should focus on not only creating a product that enhances the convenience of a person’s life but should also consider simplifying the customer interaction process in order to boost loyalty.  </p>
