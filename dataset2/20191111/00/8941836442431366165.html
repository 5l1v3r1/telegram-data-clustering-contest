      <p>NATCHITOCHES, La. (AP) - Jurors will be brought in from another parish for the trial of a Louisiana mother charged with first-degree murder in the 2018 burning death of her 6-month-old son.</p>
      <p>The Alexandria Town Talk reports Hanna Nicole Barker will still be tried in Natchitoches. Barker is accused of asking her girlfriend Felicia Marie-Nicole Smith to kill her son Levi Cole Ellerbe.</p>
      <p>Barker’s attorney Dru Thompson and Natchitoches Parish District Attorney Billy Joe Harrington agreed Thursday to the use of outside jurors.</p>
      <p>Smith also is charged with first-degree murder after allegedly putting the infant in a roadside ditch, dousing him with gasoline and setting him on fire in July 2018.</p>
      <p>Ellerbe was found with third- and second-degree burns covering 90% of his body. He later died.</p>
