      <p>ZURICH (AP) - FIFA has banned a former soccer official for 10 years for mismanaging “a significant amount” of money from the governing body.</p>
      <p>FIFA says former Tanzanian soccer federation president <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jamal-malinzi/">Jamal Malinzi</a> received $528,000 over four years to repay alleged loans he made that “lack proper justification or explanation.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jamal-malinzi/">Malinzi</a> also received $55,000 in prize money earned by Tanzania’s under-17 team at the African youth championship in 2017.</p>
      <p>FIFA says <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jamal-malinzi/">Malinzi</a> was a member of its development committee - allocating project funds worldwide - and its fair play and social responsibility committee from 2013-17 when he was taking money.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jamal-malinzi/">Malinzi</a> was also fined 500,000 Swiss francs ($503,000).</p>
