      <h1>Psychiatric unit nurses call in union over patient attacks on staff</h1>
      <h2>Unison claims the situation at Inverclyde Royal Hospital in Greenock is putting staff and patients at risk of serious injury.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T00:00:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Vivienne Aitken, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/vivienne-aitken/</a></address>
      <p>Nurses from psychiatric units at a Scots <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hospitals">hospital</a> claim four members of staff have gone off sick after being assaulted by patients.</p>
      <p>One worker is understood to have a broken collarbone while others are believed to have injuries including bruised ribs.</p>
      <p>Staff from the acute admissions unit and the intensive psychiatric care unit at Inverclyde Royal Hospital in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/greenock">Greenock</a> have accused bosses of understaffing their departments.</p>
      <p>And they claim that they have been forced to deal with patients armed with potential weapons.</p>
      <p>Union officials believe the situation at the hospital is so serious “staff and patients are at genuine risk of serious injury or long-term damage to their health and well-being”. <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/unions">Union</a> officials claim four were assaulted but the NHS insist the figure is two.</p>
      <p>Trade union Unison is demanding NHS Greater Glasgow &amp; Clyde (NHSGGC) takes action to address a catalogue of concerns.</p>
      <p>In a letter to CEO Jane Grant, the union said: “Attempts by local stewards to raise concerns and reach resolutions have been unsuccessful.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Members have requested that Unison raise their concerns and call for an urgent independent task force response to ensure that staff, patients and the public are provided with a safe environment.”</p>
      <p>The union also claim a patient brought from prison was admitted with “numerous knives and razor blades attached to his person”.</p>
      <p>Unison’s Matt McLaughlin said: “If people are being delivered to these units equipped to cause harm then someone could be killed. I hope that doesn’t happen but it will be on the health board if it does occur.”</p>
      <p>Labour’s health spokeswoman Monica Lennon said: “It’s shocking that little is being done to protect health workers.”</p>
      <p>NHSGGC said: “We take very seriously any assaults or acts of violence against our staff and have a dedicated team of experts who train and support staff in techniques to reduce and manage violence.</p>
      <p>“We have recently successfully recruited five new members of staff to join the team which will reduce the requirement for additional bank or agency staff to support the team.”</p>
