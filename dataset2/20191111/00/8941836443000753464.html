        <b>ANALYSIS/OPINION:</b>
      </p>
      <p>The ongoing House process to impeach President Trump represents the most egregious abuse of our Constitution in our nation’s history. A political party, which has been hell-bent on removing this president from the day he won the election (and even before that), is for the first time using the impeachment clause of the Constitution for blatant political purposes. Its impeachment leader, Rep. Adam Schiff, has blatantly lied to the American people — repeatedly — in the course of developing the “case” against President Trump.</p>
      <p>Every American, regardless of political affiliation or their opinion of President Trump, should be aghast, shocked and worried about the precedent this sets. Every president from here on, regardless of party, will be subject to impeachment from the day of his or her election simply because the opposing party is unhappy with the election results. Who needs the Russians or Ukrainians to interfere with our elections when we have the Democrats right here at home?</p>
