      <p>Disney’s new streaming service Disney+ launches this week in the US, Canada and the Netherlands. Disney+ promises to throw a new wrench into the online streaming ecosystem by offering up content not only from the Disney Vault, but across Disney’s many brands, from <i>Star Wars </i>to <i>Marvel </i>to <i>Pixar </i>and even the newly acquired Fox catalog, not to mention National Geographic.</p>

      <p>The service is also being offered at a ridiculously cheap price–just $6.99 a month, or $69.99 per year–well below Netflix’s $12.99 per month “Standard” package, while offering many of the same benefits like multiple accounts, streams and 4K. The service will also allow you to download content to your devices to watch offline.</p>
      <p>So which devices will be able to stream Disney+ content? I suppose the real question is what <i>isn’t </i>compatible with Disney+, and the first thing that comes to mind is the Nintendo Switch which, at least at this point, remains off the list.</p>
      <p>Here are all the devices that you’ll be able to use the Disney+ app with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Roku</li>
        <li>PlayStation 4</li>
        <li>Fire TV</li>
        <li>Apple TV</li>
        <li>Android</li>
        <li>iOS</li>
        <li>Chromecast</li>
        <li>Xbox One</li>
        <li>Samsung Smart TVs</li>
        <li>LG Smart TVs</li>
        <li>Web browsers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Fire TV was a recent addition as Disney and Amazon took quite some time to work out a deal. You’ll be able to use your Alexa to activate the service as well.</p>
      <p>That covers most of the bases for most consumers out there as far as I can tell. I do most of my streaming on my PS4 or PC, and on tablets or phones when traveling. I shouldn’t ever have a problem streaming Disney+, in other words, and I doubt many others will, either.</p>
      <p>Unless all you own is a Nintendo Switch. Then you’re out of luck, I’m afraid.</p>
