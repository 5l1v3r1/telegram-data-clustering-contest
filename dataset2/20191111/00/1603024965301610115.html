      <p>"His Royal Highness will witness how India makes use of innovation to respond to natural disasters and how its clean technology is helping deal with the challenges of climate change. He will celebrate our strong cultural links and experience the warm hospitality that diverse religious communities in India have to offer," he said.</p>
      <p>During the visit, Prince Charles will participate in a discussion on how to strengthen disaster resilience and tackle the effects of climate change at the Indian Meteorological Department.</p>
      <p>He will also visit a gurdwara to celebrate the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev and mark the contribution of the Sikh community in the UK. He will then attend a military service to commemorate the sacrifices of soldiers from India, the UK and across the Commonwealth in World War One and World War Two.</p>
      <p>The royal, who will mark his 71st birthday while in India on Thursday, will present a Commonwealth “Points of Light” award to an Indian winner for her exemplary contribution to the field of social development that involves upliftment of disabled children, family counselling and therapy sessions.</p>
      <p>He is also scheduled to attend a discussion with influential Indian business leaders to seek their advice and input on sustainable markets.</p>
      <p>"His many visits to India and his enduring interest in promoting our common interests is another example of the living bridge between the United Kingdom and India," added Asquith.</p>
      <p>Prince Charles had last visited India as part of a joint official tour with wife Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, to Brunei, India, Singapore and Malaysia in November 2017.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
