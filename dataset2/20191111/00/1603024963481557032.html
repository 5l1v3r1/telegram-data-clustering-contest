      <p>Profit-taking hit D-Street on November 8 after Moodyâ€™s Investors Services changed the outlook on India to negative from a stable, which pulled down the returns for both the Sensex and Nifty for the week ended November 8.</p>
      <p>The Sensex which hit a record high of 40,749 on November 8 closed the week with gains of just 0.4 percent. The Nifty had a touch-and-go moment with 12,000 but managed to hold above 11,900 to close the week with gains of 0.15 percent for the week ended November 8.</p>
      <p>The broader market continued to remain under pressure as the S&amp;P BSE Mid-cap index fell 1.07 percent while the S&amp;P BSE Small-cap index was down 0.93 percent in the same period.</p>
