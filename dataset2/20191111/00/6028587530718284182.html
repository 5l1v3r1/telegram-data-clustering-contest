      <p><b>Warner Bros.’s <i>Doctor Sleep</i> failed to heed the lessons of <i>Blade Runner 2049, Terminator: Genisys </i>and <i>Zoolander 2</i>. </b><i>Doctor Sleep </i>was the latest seemingly surefire IP adaptation to open much lower than hoped/expected this weekend. The $45 million-budgeted, Mike Flanagan-directed flick was tracking for an over/under $25 million Fri-Sun frame. Yet, despite good reviews, a strong track record for Warner Bros. horror and a (relatively speaking) marquee filmmaker in Flanagan, the Ewan McGregor/Rebecca Ferguson flick sputtered with just $14.1 million. It only earned around $13 million overseas, dashing hopes of potential <i>Conjuring</i>-like overseas numbers too. So, as I seem to be asking every week for one big release or another, what went wrong? This won’t be a numbered list, because, truth be told, there is one overreaching explanation for what didn’t go right. That explanation is: <i>The Shining</i>.</p>
      <p>Ewan McGregor is a terrific actor and (seemingly) a decent human being, but Ewan McGregor is not a “butts in seats” movie star and never has been. We horror nerds have been firmly on #TeamFlanagan since <i>Oculus</i>, but the general public couldn’t tell you who directed <i>Ouija: Origin of Evil </i>if you offered to pay off their student loans. Warner Bros. perhaps should have opened the R-rated horror flick before Halloween, but I’d then counter that <i>Joker </i>was the primary beneficiary of last month’s comparative lack of conventional horror flicks. Moreover, despite a national sneak preview 12 days prior to opening, the film’s reviews were positive without being superlative. But the primary culprit is the very reason it got made: <i>The Shining</i>.</p>
      <p>Yes, <i>The Shining </i>is one of Stephen King’s most popular and well-known novels. And, yes, the 1980 Stanley Kubrick adaptation was a moderate hit ($44 million domestic in 1980/$142 million adjusted for inflation) that has since grown in esteem to the point where it is listed with <i>Psycho</i>, <i>Alien </i>and <i>Jaws </i>near the top of movie critics and horror fans’ “scariest movie ever” lists. But to general audiences, it’s that book they may have read or that movie they might remember seeing back in the day. The Jack Nicholson/Shelly Long film has been parodied to death, but it’s also a painfully slow (intentionally so) tone poem that runs 143 minutes with an emphasis on rising dread versus conventional scares and shocks.</p>

      <p>It’s also, despite an emphasis on mood over frights, a distinctly R-rated movie that hasn’t been part of most family’s “family movie night.” The nostalgia that Warner Bros. was counting on for <i>The Shining </i>was a case of online chatter not being proportional to general audience interest. Paramount learned the same grim lesson in 2016 with <i>Zoolander 2 </i>while Sony and Warner Bros. learned it previously with Alcon’s <i>Blade Runner 2049</i>. The nerds and entertainment press were jazzed for a sequel to Ridley Scott’s cult bomb, another film whose esteem has risen over the last 35 years, but general audiences weren’t <i>Blade Runner </i>obsessives and didn’t care. It earned a decent $89 million domestic/$242 million gross, but on a $160 million budget.</p>
      <p>Like <i>The Shining</i>, <i>Blade Runner </i>was also an unapologetically R-rated Warner Bros. movie that wasn’t exactly going to be a “Gee kids, let’s watch this after school tonight!” pick. It’s not <i>Star Wars</i>, <i>Batman, Ghostbusters,</i> <i>Jurassic Park </i>or any number of the Disney toons. Even the R-rated <i>Halloween </i>is short enough and soft enough (in terms of onscreen content) to potentially be a “family night pick” when the kids are old enough to watch most PG-13 fare.  Moreover, not only did <i>Blade Runner </i>and <i>The Shining </i>not get reintroduced to young kids by their parents, those parents were unable to take their kids to the 2.5-hour, R-rated genre flicks. So that meant either paying for a babysitter or waiting until VOD.</p>
      <p>We saw this, relatively speaking, with <i>Scream 4 </i>and <i>American Wedding </i>in early 2011. Both films marked the return of mid-1990s franchises that were big with the kids of the era yet came so long after the last respective entries (<i>Scream 3 </i>in 2000 and <i>American Wedding </i>in 2003) that the original fans were unable to take their own kids to the R-rated flicks. It’s one reason why kid-friendly nostalgia plays like <i>Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle</i>, <i>Jurassic World</i> and <i>The Force Awakens </i>played better than <i>Terminator: Dark Fate </i>or <i>A Good Day to Die Hard</i>. I’m sure plenty of adults were curious about a well-reviewed sequel to <i>The Shining </i>yet not interested enough to hire a sitter and see it in theaters.</p>

      <p>And, like the <i>Blade Runner 2049 </i>campaign, the marketing for <i>Doctor Sleep </i>offered little for folks who weren’t jazzed for a <i>Shining </i>sequel. The trailers, commercials and posters highlighted, above all else, that the film was a sequel to <i>The Shining</i>, and most of the media coverage concerned King’s displeasure with Kubrick’s 1980 movie and how <i>Doctor Sleep </i>combined the 2013 book and the three versions of <i>The Shining </i>(the book, the first movie and the ABC mini-series) into one hybrid feature film. That’s interesting, but it’s also irrelevant and potentially confusing for folks who just wanted a horror movie. Even with a seemingly responsible $45 million budget, Warner vastly overestimated the interest in this specific piece of IP.</p>
      <p>Yes, the scary part is that <i>Doctor Sleep </i>didn’t just open below expectations, it opened at around the same levels as any number of non-IP (and much cheaper) horror flicks. It was about on par with Flanagan’s own <i>Ouija </i>prequel (a $14 million debut and a $81 million worldwide cume on a $9 million budget) and his original breakout title <i>Oculus </i>(a $12 million opening in 2014). Like Denis Villeneuve, Flanagan is a promising new talent (and he’ll be fine in the long run) who got sucked into the allure of big-budget IP continuation and suffered his first high-profile flop as a result. But for Hollywood, <i>Doctor Sleep </i>is another reminder that IP is worse than worthless if audiences don’t care.</p>
      <p>When you look at the over/under $25 million openings of original horror flicks like <i>Don’t Breathe </i>and <i>Lights Out</i>, you can arguably declare that <i>Doctor Sleep</i>’s connections to <i>The Shining </i>turned out to be a deterrent. As far as “what went wrong,” the scariest answer is “nothing.” As a movie, nitpicks and personal subjective critical opinions notwithstanding, Warner Bros. gave a reasonable budget to an upper-scale horror flick with a strong cast, an accomplished horror filmmaker and a seemingly viable IP in a seemingly safe theatrical genre. But <i>Doctor Sleep </i>performed worse than your average horror movie because audiences didn’t remotely care about <i>The Shining</i>. When your IP earns less than your somewhat similar outright originals, that’s a sign the project was doomed from inception.</p>
