      <p>SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) - New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has been outspoken about cracking down on methane emissions, but the advisory panel tasked with creating recommendations is meeting behind closed doors.</p>
      <p>The Santa Fe New Mexican reports even the time and place of the panel’s meetings are kept private.</p>
      <p>There have been no published agendas or meeting minutes on what the panel has discussed despite the political importance of the sessions.</p>
      <p>Panel members and a spokeswoman for the governor say that in addition to the meetings being largely technical, making them public would thwart frank discussion.</p>
      <p>The panel includes industry representatives and environmental lawyers. None has talked about what has taken place at the meetings.</p>
      <hr/>
      <hr/>
      <p>The state expects to hold public meetings on the panel’s final report before the end of the year.</p>
