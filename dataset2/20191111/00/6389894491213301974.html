      <h1>Women make up bulk of new non-exec directors for first time</h1>

      <p>Women made up the majority of newly appointed non-executive directors to FTSE 150 boards last year for the first time, new analysis of UK boardrooms has shown.</p>

      <p>In the 2018-19 financial year, a record 72 per cent of FTSE 150 boards appointed a new non-executive director as they sought to reinvigorate their companies. This was up from 65 per cent in 2018, executive search firm Spencer Stuart said today.</p>
      <p>“The class of 2019 showcase record levels of diversity – whether in terms of education, experience, skills, gender, race, ethnicity, nationality, and age,” said Tessa Bamford, a member of Spencer Stuart’s board practice.</p>
      <p>However, big business in the UK has a long way to go in terms of gender diversity. There are only six women CEOs of FTSE 100 companies and firms reported significant gender pay gaps earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Out of the newly-appointed non-executive directors to the 150 biggest UK companies, over a quarter were first-time directors. The average age of all new non-executive directors was 57, Spencer Stuart said.</p>
      <p>A third have a financial services background and a quarter were experienced CEOs. More than 90 per cent did not attend Oxbridge, a figure that stands in stark contrast to 55 per cent of the latest UK cabinet.</p>
      <p>Bamford said: “Boards are recognising the strategic imperative for new perspectives and experience in the boardroom. As we continue to see a reduction in the number of chairs and CEOs holding outside board roles, there is increased opportunity to breathe new life into corporate Britain.”</p>
      <p>She added: “To remain relevant, to be able to make a meaningful contribution to strategy and challenge management effectively, boards need to refresh themselves continually and seek out directors who can bring in much-needed knowledge and experience from the front line.”</p>
