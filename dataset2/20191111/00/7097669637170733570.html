      <h1>Hong Kong police shoot protester as protests start working week</h1>

      <p>Hong Kong (AFP) - A Hong Kong police officer shot at masked protesters on Monday morning -- hitting at least one in the torso -- during clashes broadcast live on Facebook, as the city's rush hour was interrupted by protests.</p>
      <p>Footage showed a police officer drawing his sidearm in the district of Sai Wan Ho as he tried to detain a masked man at a road junction that had been blocked by protesters.</p>
      <p>Another masked man then approached the officer and was apparently shot in the chest area, quickly falling to the ground, clutching his left side. His condition was not clear.</p>
      <p>Seconds later, two more live rounds were fired by the officer during a scuffle and another masked man went to the ground, although the footage was less clear as to whether he was struck.</p>
      <p>Police could later be seen detaining the two men on the ground. The first man had a pool of blood next to him, his body limp as officers moved him around and apparently tried to tie his hands.</p>
      <p>The second man was conscious and talking.</p>
      <p>A police source, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed to AFP that live rounds were fired at more than one protester in Sai Wan Ho and that a statement would be issued.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong has been upended by five months of huge and increasingly violent rallies, but Beijing has refused to give in to most of the movement's demands.</p>
      <p>Tensions have soared in recent days following the death on Friday of a 22-year-old student who succumbed to injuries sustained from a fall in the vicinity of a police clearance operation the weekend before.</p>
      <p>The city has seen four days of consecutive protests since the student's death as well as tens of thousands attending mass vigils.</p>
      <p>Using online messaging forums, activists had called for a general strike on Monday morning.</p>
      <p>Flashmob protests sprung up in multiple districts during the morning commuter period, with small groups of masked protesters targeting subway stations and building barricades on road junctions.</p>
      <p>Even before the shooting in Sai Wan Ho, tear gas had been fired in at least two other locations.</p>
      <p>Monday's shooting is the third time protesters have been shot with live rounds by police.</p>
      <p>On 1 October a student was struck in the chest as he and a group of activists attacked an officer with sticks and poles. He survived his wound and is being prosecuted.</p>
      <p>Days later a 14-year-old boy was shot in the leg when a policeman in plainclothes fired his gun after his car was attacked by a crowd. He also survived and was arrested.</p>
