      <p>Audi’s luxury rental service, <a href="https://www.silvercar.com/">Silvercar</a> and activewear brand, <a href="https://www.outdoorvoices.com/">Outdoor Voices</a> want you to <a href="https://www.silvercar.com/blog/silvercar-outdoor-voices-campaign/">explore Austin in style</a>. Both Austin-based companies teamed up this season to create a premium travel experience in their home city while inspiring travelers to be active and explore by #DoingThings, the activewear company’s famed slogan. In a partnership that’s first of its kind for both brands, each Silvercar rental offers Outdoor Voices apparel, a local activity guide and an exclusive discount through the end of this year.</p>

      <p>Silvercar held an Instagram poll and discovered that 68% of their followers find it hard to prioritize wellness when they travel, and 96% said they would be more active if they were given the extra motivation to explore. Between luxury wheels, complimentary gear and expert local advice, both companies are sure they can get you moving while inspiring fun adventures. From honky tonks to swimming holes, or discovering an Italianate villa on Lake Austin, you can stay active while living like a local.</p>

      <p>“Staying active is so important for your overall well-being, however we know that it’s not always realistic when on-the-road,” said Grace Glenewinkel, brand marketing and partnerships manager at Silvercar Inc. “Partnering with Outdoor Voices was a natural fit for us because we both believe in making <i>Doing Things </i>as easy as possible for our customers – from a seamless rental process to easing the stress of what to wear when on-the-go. Now, Silvercar customers will feel inspired to take a light stroll or break a sweat all over Austin.”</p>
      <p>Silvercar offers customers access to the latest model vehicles fully-loaded with on-board Wi-Fi and SiriusXM satellite radio — always included at no additional cost. All Silvercar renters will continue to benefit from no fuel upcharges, no mileage restrictions, no additional fees for toll charges, and no fees for car seat rentals. Prices start at $59 per day for the Audi A4 and $69 per day for the Audi Q5, and best of all, the Silvercar team takes care of your airport pick-up and drop-off for added convenience.</p>
