      <p>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) - The pro-China opposition candidate in Taiwan’s presidential election set for early next year has chosen a former <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/google/">Google</a> executive as his running mate.</p>
      <p>Chang San-cheng, a political independent, on Monday joined the ticket of Nationalist Party candidate Han Kuo-yu, who lags behind Democratic Progressive Party incumbent Tsai Ing-wen in most polls. Cheng is an engineer who received master’s and doctoral degrees from Stanford and Cornell universities in the United States.</p>
      <p>China claims sovereignty over Taiwan and has sought to isolate Tsai for her independence-leaning positions. The sides split amid civil war in 1949 and Beijing has threatened to use military force to bring the self-governing, democratic island under its control.</p>
      <p>Chang served briefly as Cabinet chief in the administration of Tsai’s predecessor, Ma Ying-jeou, who was favored by Beijing for his policies promoting integration between the sides.</p>
      <p>Chang worked as search engine <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/google/">Google</a>’s head of technology in Asia from 2010 to 2012.</p>
