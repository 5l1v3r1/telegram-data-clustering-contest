      <p>Germany’s favorite sparkling wine Rotkäppchen (meaning “Red Hood” in German) doesn’t just share a name with a folk story, its history of struggle and success is also not unlike a fairytale.Few companies have ever had to face the challenge faced by Rotkäppchen. Founded in <a href="https://www.therealbubbly.com/about-rotkaeppchen/">1856</a> in Saxony-Anhalt, the company survived two global conflicts before ending up on the eastern side of the Iron Curtain.</p>
      <p>Like the vast majority of private enterprises under the Soviet Union-affiliated German Democratic Republic (GDR, East Germany), Rotkäppchen was nationalized. But as the fall of the Berlin Wall signaled the beginning of the end for the GDR—and indeed, of the Soviet Union—Rotkäppchen faced another existential threat: the struggle for survival in an open, competitive market.</p>
      <p>“The company was on the verge of collapse,” says Christof Queisse, CEO Rotkäppchen-Mumm Sektkellereie.</p>
      <h3>Privatization Challenges</h3>
      <p>State-owned East German companies were placed in the hands of <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/treuhand-took-the-heat-for-privatization-of-east-german-economy/a-5985015">the Treuhand trust,</a> which was created in the summer of 1990 and ended up overseeing 12,000 companies employing around 4 million people.</p>
      <p>Jörn Kleinhardt, head of collections at the DDR Museum, estimates that around 30 brands are still around these days—mostly food and drinks and beauty and hygiene products. </p>

      </figure>
      <p>Most East Germany companies found themselves unable to compete against rivals that had three decades of experience navigating market conditions.</p>
      <p>“Publicly-owned enterprises were structured very inefficiently. Outdated machines and a decades-long lack of investments led to an extremely high staffing ratio. At the same time, sales market of these enterprises collapsed, as West German companies administered the East German markets and distributed their own goods,” Kleinhardt says.</p>
      <p>Failure to manage the transition from a planned to a free market economy meant an estimated 2.5 million employees lost their jobs between 1989 and 1991—around one third of all jobs in the new east German federal states of reunified Germany, Kleinhardt notes. </p>
      <h3>Sparkling Success</h3>
      <p>Rotkäppchen was among the companies that struggled with the transition, seeing a steep decline in sales due to increased competition. But some of the executive employees of Rotkäppchen believed the company could have a future in reunified Germany and took it over from the Treuhand in 1993 in a management buyout. “It was necessary to reduce the workforce, to adapt to the new market conditions and to find new sales channels in all parts of Germany. It took a lot of courage and entrepreneurial action, but in the end these people managed to make Rotkäppchen successful again,” says Queisse. </p>
      <p>By 2002, Rotkäppchen had established a leading market position, generating a swirl of headlines in the international press. “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1023219509865290040">Eastern Germany's Rotkaeppchen Goes Up Against the West, and Wins</a>” wrote the <i>Wall Street Journal.</i> <b>“</b><a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2002/05/30/a-bubbly-little-tale">A bubbly little tale</a>,” titled <i>The Economist</i>. “<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/1385880/Communist-champagne-takes-over-Western-rival.html">'Communist champagne' takes over Western rival</a>,” noted the <i>Daily Telegraph.</i></p>
      <p>Following the acquisition of the sparkling wine brands of Canadian Seagram Company in 2005, the company is now called Rotkäppchen-Mumm Sektkellereien and boasts a<b> </b>870-strong workforce with a reported turnover of €1.085 billion (including sparkling wine tax and spirits tax, excluding VAT), commanding nearly 54% of the German sparkling wine market.</p>

      <p>Rotkäppchen’s story is more of an exception than a rule as a few found owners willing to fight for the survival of the brand. In some other cases a brand that had failed has been resurrected in the 2000s. </p>
      <p>Such was the case for <a href="https://www.zeha-berlin.de/en/our-story/">Zeha</a> shoes, pretty much the only sports shoe existing in East Germany and known for its two-stripe design, which was “resurrected” by Alexander Barré in 2002 and now counts <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-23/rebooting-communist-kicks-for-modern-sneakerheads">revenue of around €3 million</a> ($3.4 million). </p>
      <h3>East Germany Nostalgia</h3>
      <p>Those companies and brands that did not survive privatization have now found a home in Berlin’s DDR Museum, which holds more than 300,000 objects—although only about 0.5% of the collection is actually exhibited to the public.</p>
      <p>The museum offers a chance for visitors to understand what life behind the Iron Curtain was like, as well as offering those who lived in East Germany the opportunity to reminisce about their past life.</p>

      <p>Nostalgia for the days of GDR has been on the rise in East Germany<a href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/homesick-for-a-dictatorship-majority-of-eastern-germans-feel-life-better-under-communism-a-634122.html"> in the past decade</a>, so much so that it’s got its own word in German, <i>ostalgie</i>.</p>
      <p>Kleinhardt says that the objects that evoke the most nostalgia are those with “a high recognition value,” such as the car model Trabant, widely popular groceries or items related to childhood memories like toys, school books or clothes. </p>
      <p>“Across the board, the nostalgic factors is higher if unpolitical exhibits are involved, because these are less debatable or open to attack. Nevertheless, we put everything in the context of the governmental and economic structures of the DDR in our exhibition,” Kleinhardt says.</p>
      <p>Rotkäppchen is also keen to highlight its pan-German roots rather than evoke <i>ostalgie</i>. “Since the 19th century, the roots of the company, and the brand Rotkäppchen lie in the heart of Germany,” Queisse says, adding: “Independent of political developments, the company has always been defined by these factors since being founded in 1856.” </p>
