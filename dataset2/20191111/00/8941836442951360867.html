      <p>WARREN, Mich. (AP) - CARE of Southeastern Michigan is presenting a discussion in Macomb County about vaping and its risk to children.</p>
      <p>Tuesday night’s free event will be held the Macomb Community College South Campus in Warren, north of Detroit. Parents and school-aged children are encouraged to attend.</p>
      <p>Federal health officials have tallied nearly 1,900 cases of vaping-related lung illness nationwide as of Oct. 29, including 37 deaths confirmed in 24 states.</p>
      <p>Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in September ordered the issuance of emergency rules banning flavored electronic cigarettes after her chief medical executive found that youth vaping is a public health emergency. Whitmer has accused the makers of using candy flavors and deceptive ads to hook children.</p>
