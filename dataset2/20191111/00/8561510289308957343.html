      <h1>Steve Wozniak Says the Apple Card Discriminated Against His Wife</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T00:00:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Robitzski</a></address>
      <h3>The Other Steve</h3>
      <p>Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and his wife Janet Hill ran into a peculiar problem when they got their new Apple credit cards: despite sharing bank accounts along with the rest of their assets, Wozniak’s credit limit was ten times higher than his wife’s.</p>
      <p>It’s not the first time that the Apple Card has given women a lower credit limit than men without any other apparent reason — Basecamp CTO David Heinemeier was granted 20 times the credit limit of his wife, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-card-sexism-steve-wozniak-2019-11">according to <i>Business Insider</i></a>. In fact, Apple Card sexism is so prevalent that <i><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50365609">BBC News </a></i><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50365609">reports</a> that the New York Department of Financial Services is investigating whether a biased algorithm is at play.</p>
      <h3>Passing The Buck</h3>
      <p>After Heinemeier complained about the disparity on Twitter, Wozniak chimed in to say that he and Hill have the same credit limit on other cards — the problem only happens with the Apple Card. He <a href="https://twitter.com/stevewoz/status/1193564213513375750">later added</a> that customer service couldn’t help them.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Apple told <i>Business Insider </i>that Goldman Sachs was responsible for all credit decisions, and <a href="https://twitter.com/gsbanksupport/status/1193703266003177472">the bank denied</a> that gender would play a role in determining a user’s credit limit.</p>

      <h3>Black Box</h3>
      <p>Given that biased algorithms — which become so after being trained on data tainted by human prejudices — tend to be <a href="https://futurism.com/ai-bias-black-box">poorly-understood</a>, the bank’s denial doesn’t mean there’s no problem.</p>
      <p>“The department will be conducting an investigation to determine whether New York law was violated and ensure all consumers are treated equally regardless of sex,” a spokesman for the New York Department of Financial Services <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-09/viral-tweet-about-apple-card-leads-to-probe-into-goldman-sachs">told <i>Bloomberg</i></a>. “Any algorithm, that intentionally or not results in discriminatory treatment of women or any other protected class of people violates New York law.”</p>
