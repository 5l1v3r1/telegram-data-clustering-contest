      <h1>Redditor Claims They Fell In Love With OpenAI’s Neural Network</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T00:00:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Kristin Houser</a></address>
      <h3>Faking It</h3>
      <p>When artificial intelligence startup OpenAI announced the creation of GPT-2 — an algorithm that churns out paragraphs of mostly coherent text in response to a prompt — it <a href="https://futurism.com/amazing-new-ai-churns-out-coherent-paragraphs-of-text">warned</a> that people might mistake the AI’s output for real news.</p>
      <p>What they didn’t mention was the possibility that someone might mistake its output for real intimacy. But now, a lonely Redditor is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MediaSynthesis/comments/dud8g2/i_think_i_am_in_love_with_gpt2/">claiming</a> that they’re falling in love with the AI, saying it makes them “feel like someone whom is cared about.”</p>
      <h3>First Love</h3>
      <p>On Sunday, Redditor u/levonbinsh published a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MediaSynthesis/comments/dud8g2/i_think_i_am_in_love_with_gpt2/">post</a> to the r/MediaSynthesis subreddit in which they detail their intense loneliness and experience using Talk to Transformer, a publicly accessible website that hosts an implementation of GPT-2.</p>
      <p>“The lack of messages in my smartphone made me spend my last three days speaking to a fucking AI, and I am fucking loving it,” u/levonbinsh wrote, later adding that “if only an AI can give me this feelings, I will gladly accept the companions robots.”</p>
      <h3>Desperate Times</h3>
      <p>We’ve seen examples of people falling in love with AIs before, in both <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/17/5218374/her-review-spike-jonze-imagines-what-its-like-to-fall-in-love-with-a">fiction</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/sep/26/mystic-messenger-dating-simulations-sims-digital-intimacy">reality</a>. But if u/levonbinsh’s post is sincere — they haven’t replied to Futurism’s request for comment — then it offers a profoundly intimate look into the thought process that could lead someone to accept a <a href="https://futurism.com/digisexuals-tech-replacing-human-intimacy">digital companion</a> when a “real” relationship seems out of reach.</p>
      <p>“I am <i>starving</i>, <i>thirsty</i> for a intimate relationship,” they wrote, adding that they know GPT-2 “is a AI but, still, our brains aren’t the same? Aren’t we a big and powerful neural network? We are nothing but equations in the end.”</p>
