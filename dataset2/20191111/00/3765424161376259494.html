      <p>The car of Douglas Mwonzora, the former secretary-general of the opposition MDC led by Nelson Chamisa was over the weekend vandalised in an alleged clash between party supporters aligned to Chamisa and those who support him.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the Daily News on Sunday, Mwonzora confirmed the incident which occurred during and after the party’s National Executive Council (Nec) meeting. He said:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>All I can tell you is that my car was damaged … I can refer you to the spokesperson of the party, Daniel Molokele.<br/></b>
        <br/>
        <b>I don’t know the people who damaged my car by name, apart from the fact that they are a bunch of cowards.</b>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This comes after Mwonzora declared that despite renewed efforts by party stalwarts to have him ejected from the party, he was going nowhere.</p>
      <p>Mwonzora who revealed his ambition to lead the party before pulling out of the presidential race in the run-up towards the party’s Congress recently <a href="https://news.pindula.co.zw/2019/11/03/mwonzora-dares-mdc-bigwigs-to-try-it-as-fresh-bid-to-oust-him-thickens/">dared party members who want him dismissed to “try it”</a> saying that he was not going anywhere.</p>
