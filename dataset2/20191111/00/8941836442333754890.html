      <p>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) - The Latest on a Utah death-row inmate who died in prison (all times local):</p>
      <p>3:55 p.m.</p>
      <p>Author Jon Krakauer says he’s grateful that a Utah death-row inmate who killed his brother’s wife and her toddler has died of natural causes and won’t be executed by firing squad in what would have been a circus of an event.</p>
      <p>Krakauer made the comment Monday, hours after Utah prison officials said 78-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ron-lafferty/">Ron Lafferty</a> had died of natural causes.</p>
      <p>Krakauer’s 2003 best-selling book “Under the Banner of Heaven” about radical offshoots of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints included <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ron-lafferty/">Lafferty</a>, who claimed he had received a revelation from God to kill the two because of his sister-in-law’s resistance to his fundamentalist belief in polygamy.</p>

      <p>Krakauer says he hopes <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ron-lafferty/">Lafferty</a>’s death brings some closure to the relatives of Brenda Lafferty, who died in 1984 along with her 15-month-old daughter Erica.</p>
      <p>The Utah state attorney general’s office had expected <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ron-lafferty/">Lafferty</a> to be executed in 2020 and become the first American executed by firing squad in nearly a decade.</p>

        <p>Utah prison officials say a death-row inmate whose double-murder case was featured in the book “Under the Banner of Heaven” and who was nearing an execution by firing squad has died of natural causes.</p>
        <p>Utah Department of Corrections spokeswoman Kaitlin Felsted said in a statement Monday that 78-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ron-lafferty/">Ron Lafferty</a> died at the state prison in the Salt Lake City suburb of Draper.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ron-lafferty/">Lafferty</a> was likely only months away from becoming the first American executed by firing squad in nearly a decade after an appeals court rejected his latest his appeal in August.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ron-lafferty/">Lafferty</a> was convicted in the 1984 deaths of his sister-in-law and her baby daughter. He claimed the killings carried out with his brother were directed by God because of the victim’s resistance to his beliefs in polygamy.</p>
