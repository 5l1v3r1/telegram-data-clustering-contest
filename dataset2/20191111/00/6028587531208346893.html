      <p>White Claw, the go-to, hard-seltzer sensation of this past summer has introduced a hot new category and made its founder, Anthony von Mandl, a rock star in the spirits world. If you haven’t been on social media or the beach this summer, you may have missed the White Claw tidal wave. The fruity alcoholic beverage became an overnight hit, even though it's been around since 2016. The drink is made in different flavors from a blend of seltzer water, a gluten-free alcohol base, fermented sugars derived from malted gluten-free grains and  flavoring. It's a line, along with Mike’s Hard Lemonade, owned by Mark Anthony Brands, Mandl’s company.   </p>
      <p>White Claw<i> </i>draws its inspiration from the legend of the White Claw wave—when three perfect crests come together. Mandl also benefited from a confluence of emerging trends coming together. This includes the growing number of people who feel the social pressure to have a drink at events, but don’t particularly care for beer and desire an alternative, health-conscious folks who would like a drink, but demand low-calorie options and Millennials who have become captivated by the drink as they’re ditching beer and the embracement of social media—including a viral meme,  “Ain’t no laws when you’re drinking Claws.” The growth is remarkable and the company claims that it outsold Budweiser—one of the largest and best-known brands—in July.</p>
      <p>The hard-seltzer category has been growing incredibly fast. The space has seen triple-digit annual growth since 2016. It's believed that the group will continue rapidly growing, some estimate by about 300% in 2019.  </p>
      <p>This is all a far cry from when Anthony von Mandl began in the wine business right out of college in the 1970s. He started selling wine from a small office and out of his car in Canada. White Claw looks like it will be a follow up to his success with Mike’s Hard Lemonade. This drink, which established a new category, was a big hit in Canada and later brought into the United States. The company said, “This summer, Mark Anthony Brands became America’s fourth largest beer company.” “The U.S. business’ growth is 85% this year and accelerating and is estimated to deliver close to $4 billion in revenue in 2020.”</p>
      <p>Competitors have taken notice and are nipping at the heels of White Claw. The Boston Beer Company, best known for its Samel Adams brews, offers Truly, which is a similar drink. Big players, such as Anheuser-Busch InBev, Molson Coors Brewing, Constellation Brands and Diageo are all coming out with their own versions of hard-seltzer drinks. </p>
      <p>There are also questions over whether this is just a hot fad, like Zima, which was a lighter alternative to beer that became a brief sensation, then quickly fizzled out. </p>
