      <p>WEST POINT, N.Y. (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/army/">Army</a> assistant football coach <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mike-viti/">Mike Viti</a> is the winner of the Armed Forces Merit Award.</p>
      <p>The award began in 2012 to honor an individual or group in football. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mike-viti/">Viti</a> was selected on Veterans Day by a seven-person committee made up of Football Writers Association of America members and Armed Forces Bowl officials.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mike-viti/">Viti</a> is in his fourth season as an assistant at his alma mater. He co-founded and directs the nonprofit Legacies Alive, whose goal is to support Gold Star families, those families that have lost a member in military service.</p>
      <p>A fullback primarily used as a blocker, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mike-viti/">Viti</a> played for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/army/">Army</a> from 2004-07 and was a team captain. He served in combat in Afghanistan and earned a bronze star.</p>
      <p>After retiring from the military as a captain, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mike-viti/">Viti</a> made a 4,400-mile (7,100 kilometers) cross-country trek in 2014 dubbed <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mike-viti/">Mike</a>’s Hike for Heroes . He walked 1 kilometer for every service member killed in action during the global war on terror, finishing at the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/army/">Army</a>-Navy game in Baltimore.</p>
