      <p><b>Topline</b>: Goldman Sachs is looking into allowing family members to share a single Apple Card after a viral twitter thread accused the credit application process of being sexist, CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/11/goldman-wants-to-fix-the-apple-card-flaw-that-has-users-claiming-bias.html">reported</a>, a solution the financial services company said should fix discrimination reported by users, including Apple founder Steve Wozniak. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The uproar started after David Heinemeier Hansson, the creator of the programming language Ruby on Rails and the founder of Basscamp, tweeted on Friday that despite having a better credit score than him, Hansson’s wife was given a lower credit limit. </li>
        <li>The thread went viral, with Apple’s founder, Steve Wozniak, adding that he and his wife encountered a similar issue. Hansson’s wife eventually had her credit limit bumped up.</li>
        <li>A Goldman Sachs spokesperson <a href="https://twitter.com/gsbanksupport/status/1193703266003177472?s=20">said </a>in a statement that it doesn’t consider gender in assigning credit limits (there’s not a field for gender in the Apple Card application). The problem arose, the spokesperson said, because creditworthiness is determined on an individual basis and does not take into consideration joint household accounts. </li>
        <li>But even if it wasn’t intentional, Hansson emphasized that excluding family accounts is still discriminatory. “What percentage of ‘homemakers’ do you think are women? If they're unable to rely on shared wealth, household income, or historical earning power to demonstrate ability to repay credit, they're cut off,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1193711480039862272?s=20">tweeted</a>. </li>
        <li>CNBC reported that Goldman Sachs is “actively exploring” ways for family members to share an Apple Card.</li>
        <li>The New York Department of Financial Services <a href="https://medium.com/@nydfs/building-a-fairer-and-more-inclusive-financial-services-industry-for-everyone-917183dae954">launched </a>an investigation into the algorithm that determines creditworthiness after the tweet thread went viral.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Neither Apple nor Goldman Sachs immediately responded to a request for comment from <i>Forbes</i>. </p>
      <p><b>Crucial quote</b>:  “When the AppleCard manager told me she was aware of David’s tweets and that my credit limit would be raised to meet his, without any real explanation, I felt the weight and guilt of my ridiculous privilege. … This is not merely a story about sexism and credit algorithm blackboxes, but about how rich people nearly always get their way. Justice for another rich white woman is not justice at all,” Jamie Heinemeier Hansson, David’s wife, <a href="https://dhh.dk/2019/about-the-apple-card.html">wrote </a>in a blog post Monday responding to the controversy. </p>
      <p><b>Key background</b>: The situation highlighted for many in tech how bias can be inadvertently baked into algorithms making decisions about who gets access to important services. Amazon, for example, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight/amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-women-idUSKCN1MK08G">scrapped </a>a hiring algorithm after it was found to be prioritizing male candidates.</p>
      <p>“No one wants to live under the capricious rule of THE ALGORITHM. Not in finance, not in housing, not in advertising, not in hiring, not in any of the million other fields were machine learning and AI is taking over decision making power,” Hansson <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1193774524312911874?s=20">tweeted </a>Monday.</p>
