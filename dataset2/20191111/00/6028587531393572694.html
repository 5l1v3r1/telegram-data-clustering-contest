      <h1>Will This 5.5% Dividend Yield Sink Or Surge This Week?</h1>

      <p>So what’s the near-term share price outlook like for British Land? Half year financials are slated for release this Wednesday (November 13) and I fear that fresh waves of investor selling could be in the offing.The property play’s share price surged 33% in two months and to 14-month highs in late October but it’s come crashing down since then. No surprise here: Brexit uncertainty persists, with the threat of a disastrous no-deal withdrawal from the European Union pushed a little further down the line (to January 31) rather than totally eliminated.</p>
      <p>At the same time key retail indicators continue to scare as this political and economic uncertainty persists. This is especially worrying for British Land — one of the UK’s leading property development and investment firms — as almost half of its bricks-and-mortar portfolio is made up of retail assets.</p>
      <p>Latest retail data from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) underlined the malaise facing Britain’s high streets and shopping malls, with like-for-like sales edging just 0.1% higher last month. This may have signalled an improvement from the 0.8% average drop for the three months to October but this was the result of an “extraordinary period of discounting,”according to the BRC. The gloom persists, then, and the need for retail firms to keep slashing prices hardly bodes well for their bottom lines and consequently their ability to pay rents.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Stress Elsewhere?</b>
      </p>
      <p>My fears for British Land were exacerbated by a poor trading update from shopping centre operator Intu Properties last week, one in which it advised that like-for-like rental income was likely to fall 9% in 2019. The reason why? More and more retailers are experiencing financial distress and entering into corporate voluntary arrangements, as a combination of consumers tightening the pursestrings and an increasing number of shoppers buying online takes its toll on store footfall.</p>
      <p>But can investors expect the FTSE 100 firm’s other operations to provide some relief? Well it’s true that a shortage of supply is helping to support British Land’s office portfolio in the London market, though of course this market is also at the mercy of weak economic growth in the UK. And fresh GDP numbers from the Office of National Statistics released today have given fresh cause for worry.</p>
      <p>These showed British economic growth of 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in the three months to September, whilst on an annual basis this was up 1%. On the plus side the UK avoided entering recession following the contraction of quarter two, though on the other hand annual growth of just a single percent was the worst result since 2010. And fractional improvements in August and September bode badly for the remainder of this year and the beginning of 2020, too.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>The question is, then, whether British Land’s bulging 5.5% forward dividend yield for the current fiscal year (to March 2020) is worth the hassle? It’s certainly not in my book.</p>
      <p>It’s not as if the Footsie firm is particularly cheap and thus better placed to absorb any bad news in that upcoming trading update. Despite that share price weakness of recent weeks British Land still changes hands on a forward P/E ratio of 17.3 times, comfortably above the FTSE 100 corresponding average of around 14.5 times. And for a firm with such a high gearing to the Brexit-battered UK economy this is a recipe for disaster.</p>
      <p>I reckon those hunting big dividends from Britain’s blue chips should shop elsewhere. I wouldn’t be surprised to see this particular stock’s share value fall off a cliff in the days ahead.</p>
