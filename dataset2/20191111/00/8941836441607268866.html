      <h1>BART riders stage ‘eat-in’ after black man detained for ea</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T00:00:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/jessica-chasmar/" target="_blank">Jessica Chasmar</a></address>
      <p>Dozens of protesters staged an “eat-in” on a San Francisco train platform on Sunday after a video of a black man being detained by police for eating a sandwich went viral.</p>
      <p>“People should be able to eat on the platform without getting harassed,” Kelly Groth, who defiantly handed out sandwiches at the Embarcardero Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) station, where eating isn’t allowed, <a href="https://abc7news.com/society/protesters-hold-luncheon-inside-bart-after-man-detained-for-eating-on-platform/5686666/">told</a> a local ABC affiliate.</p>
      <p>“My first political awakening was back at a lunch counter in the ‘60s, now we’re back to ‘eat-ins,’ ” added John Reimann.</p>
      <p>The protest was sparked by a now-viral <a href="https://www.facebook.com/7husal0t7/videos/pcb.2520780144653829/2520765981321912/?type=3&amp;theater">video</a> of Steve Foster, a 31-year-old black man who also goes by Bill Gluckman, being detained for eating a sandwich at the Pleasant Hill BART Station. According to the video taken by Mr. Foster’s girlfriend, an officer informs Mr. Foster that he is being detained for eating on the platform and that he will be arrested for “resisting arrest.” Incredulous, Mr. Foster keeps eating his sandwich and arguing with the officer over the law, claiming he was singled out among several other people who were eating and drinking. In the video, several other police officers arrive on scene and handcuff Mr. Foster.</p>
      <p>In a statement, BART said Mr. Foster was “cited for eating” and detained for refusing to give his name but that he was not arrested.</p>

      <p>“The man was lawfully handcuffed after refusing to provide his name multiple times, once he provided his name he was cited and released,” BART said.</p>
      <p>About 30 people gathered in support of Mr. Foster on Sunday, including BART Board of Directors member Janice Li, who brought her lunch to the Embarcardero station.</p>
      <p>“I realize some things are illegal with our penal code, but I want to be mindful of how we’re using resources to enforce our system,” Ms. Li told the ABC affiliate.</p>
