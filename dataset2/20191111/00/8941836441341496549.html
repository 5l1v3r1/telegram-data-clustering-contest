      <p>DETROIT (AP) - Doctors at a Detroit hospital have performed a double lung transplant on a man whose lungs were damaged from vaping.</p>
      <p>No other details of the transplant were released Monday by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/henry-ford-health-system/">Henry Ford Health System</a>, which has scheduled a news conference Tuesday. The patient has asked his medical team to share photographs and an update to warn others about vaping.</p>
      <p>More than 2,000 Americans who vape have gotten sick since March, many of them teenagers and young adults, and at least 40 people have died.</p>
      <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week announced a breakthrough into the cause of a vaping illness outbreak, identifying a chemical compound as a “very strong culprit.” Vitamin E acetate previously was found in liquid from electronic cigarettes and other vaping devices used by many who got sick and only recently has been used as a vaping fluid thickener.</p>

        <p>Many who got sick said they had vaped liquids that contain THC, the high-inducing part of marijuana.</p>
