      <p><b>BMW</b> has unveiled a racing cousin to the <b>2020 M2 CS,</b> wrapping the road car's fundamentals in a race-ready package.</p>
      <p>Aimed at the VLN Endurance Championship and TC America racing series, the <b>M2 CS Racing</b> is powered by the same S55 inline-six turbo engine as the road-going model.</p>
      <p>Here, however, it only makes between <b>205kW</b> and <b>268kW</b> depending on the regulations of each race series.</p>

      <p>BMW says owners can tweak the outputs with a 'power stick' to meet Balance of Performance rules, and says it's planning to offer a package that boosts the output to the same <b>331kW</b> offered in the <b><a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/805466/2020-bmw-m2-cs-leaked/">road car</a></b>.</p>
      <p>It's mated with a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission exclusively, with no mention of a manual option.</p>
      <p>Compared to the regular car, the Racing has been outfitted with race-ready 18-inch alloy wheels wrapped in Michelin racing slicks. Behind the wheels are six-piston front and four-piston rear brakes, cooled by larger brake ducts than the standard car.</p>

      <p>The aero package has been updated with a deeper front splitter and a motorsport-specific rear wing.</p>
      <p>Inside, the standard centre console has been subbed for a race-ready unit with clearer lighting and easier-to-prod buttons, while the instrument binnacle has been replaced with an adjustable steering column and motorsport-specific readout.</p>
      <p>Race seats in line with FIA regulations and six-point harnesses are also standard.</p>
