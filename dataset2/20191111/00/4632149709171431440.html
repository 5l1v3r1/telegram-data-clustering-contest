      <p>Since a few days now, Bengaluru has been witnessing hazy days. Experts say that though it is a yearly phenomenon after monsoons, this year hazy days rang in early. SSM Gavaskar, Scientist at Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC) explains, “When there is clear sky, the interaction between the earth and the atmosphere is very clear. At night when it is cool, it creates a foggy situation little above from the earth’s surface. <br/><br/>When the sun rises, the fog settles down due to heat and that is why we see foggy early mornings. Since the fog is thick at times, the visibility too becomes less.” He said that November to January or February are the months for fog. However, whenever it rains, fog disappears and returns when there is a sunny day. <br/><br/>Usually foggy days are observed late in November however he says that this year, fog has been observed in early November itself. “This could be due to multiple cyclones that occurred in the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal in the last one month but more studies need to be conducted to confirm the early onset of fog in the city. We cannot directly link the fog in the city to the cyclones as of now,” he adds. <br/><br/><b><u>Fog affects 127 flights</u></b> <br/><br/>Dense fog descended over the Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) on Sunday morning throwing the air traffic out of gear. Officials said that a total of 127 flights were impacted of which 66 departures and 33 arrivals were delayed. <br/><br/>“Thirty three flights were delayed due to holding point congestion (landing and take off congestion) and four flights were diverted to Chennai,” officials added. <br/><br/>Holding point is where the ATC asks aircraft to wait for clearance for take-off. <br/><br/><br/>When a large number of aircraft are queued up due to fog (in this case) it leads to delay, and subsequently, congestion The thick dense fog has caught many by surprise as normally fog is anticipated at the KIA from November 15 to February 15. <br/><br/>The fog that occurs at KIA is known as radiation fog and it is anticipated during the four months between 3 and 8.30 am. <br/><br/><br/>At present, the airport has the precision approach runway CAT I intended for operation of aircraft using instrument approach procedures. In a month from now flight operations during winter is set to get a bit more smoother as the second runway which will come up in 2019 will be CAT III B ILS compliant.</p>
