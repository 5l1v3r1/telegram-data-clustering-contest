      <h1>Cops Can Now Get Warrants for Entire DNA Websites</h1>
      <h2>One judge's decision could set off a privacy nightmare.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T00:00:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://futurism.com/authors/kristin" target="_blank">Kristin Houser</a></address>
      <p>With just a single warrant, a Florida detective obtained access to the DNA profiles of more than a million people — and experts say the case sets a dangerous precedent.</p>
      <p>Ancestry.com and 23andMe are the largest consumer DNA sites, holding genetic data on <a href="https://www.ancestry.com/corporate/about-ancestry/company-facts">15 million</a> and <a href="https://mediacenter.23andme.com/company/about-us/">10 million</a> people, respectively. However, they aren’t the only DNA sites out there — a smaller service, GEDmatch, currently has about <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/11/search-warrant-overrides-1m-users-choice-not-to-share-dna-with-cops/">1.3 million users</a>, each of whom is able to search the site’s entire database.</p>
      <p>In May, GEDmatch <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/peteraldhous/this-genealogy-database-helped-solve-dozens-of-crimes-but">changed its policies</a> so that law enforcement officials could only search the profiles of people who opted into such searches, which GEDmatch co-founder Curtis Rogers recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/05/business/dna-database-search-warrant.html">told <i>The New York Times</i></a> about 185,000 users have done.</p>
      <p>Prior to the change, police famously used GEDMatch to crack the case of the <a href="https://futurism.com/golden-state-killer-dna">Golden State Killer</a>, resulting in the arrest of a suspect in April 2018. Detective Michael Fields had also used the database to solve a case prior to the May change and was hopeful it might help with a new one he was investigating in July.</p>
      <p>To that end, Fields decided to ask a Florida judge to grant him a warrant that would override the new policy, allowing him to search GEDmatch’s entire database, including users who hadn’t opted in — and Judge Patricia Strowbridge did just that, the detective announced at a recent police convention, according to the <i>NYT</i>.</p>
      <p>Legal experts told the <i>NYT</i> that this appears to be the first time a judge has approved a DNA website warrant this broad, with New York University law professor Erin Murphy calling it “a huge game-changer.”</p>
      <p>“The company made a decision to keep law enforcement out, and that’s been overridden by a court,” Murphy told the newspaper. “It’s a signal that no genetic information can be safe.”</p>
      <p>Again, GEDmatch is far from the biggest consumer DNA site. However, by granting Fields his warrant — which, he told the <i>NYT</i>, has resulted in some new leads for his case but no arrests — the judge may have set a precedent that makes the DNA of tens of millions of people searchable by law enforcement, whether they agree to the searches or not.</p>
      <p>“I have no question in my mind that if the public isn’t outraged by this, [law enforcement agencies] will go to the mother lode: the 15-million-person Ancestry database,” Murphy told the <i>NYT</i>. “Why play in the peanuts when you can go to the big show?”</p>
      <p>And that’s a tricky situation.</p>
      <p>On the one hand, if accessing the databases gets killers off the street, that’s obviously a good thing. But the information in DNA databases <a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/home-genetic-tests-false-results">isn’t always accurate</a>, which means its use by law enforcement could result in <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/crime-justice/2019/03/genetic-genealogy-law-enforcement-golden-state-killer-cece-moore/">wrongful arrests or convictions</a>.</p>
      <p>Then there are the privacy issues to consider. If there’s evidence that the data of a single user on a DNA site could help solve a crime, it might make sense for a judge to grant a warrant for that data. But a warrant giving law enforcement officials access to <i>all</i> of the data on a site? That could be a privacy nightmare.</p>
