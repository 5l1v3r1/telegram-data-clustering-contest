      <p>Blind alleys get a bad rap.You've been working hard. Maybe for months or even years on what you think is the right direction. You’ve set up your experiments very carefully. You have promising preliminary results. You know what you're doing and you feel like you're onto something. But then the final results come in: you’ve gone nowhere. Your promising hypothesis turned out to be unsupported, or even worse contradicted. It feels like a massive, colossal failure. A waste of precious time and money.</p>
      <p>The feelings are deceptive. Blind alleys are some of the most useful places to explore in science.</p>
      <p>The whole point of scientific research is that we have no idea what the answer is in advance. If we already knew, we wouldn't have to conduct experiments or observations to figure things out. We would simply know. It would already be established.</p>
      <p>Science lives at the frontiers, the edges. Scientists are discoverers and explorers, pushing our knowledge beyond the safe boundaries of the known and into the endless void of the unknown.</p>
      <p>So of course we're going to get it wrong. We're going to get it wrong a lot. We're going to get it wrong more often than we're going to get it right. But blind alleys are as frustrating as they are instructive. A hypothesis that is refuted still enhances our overall knowledge. Sure, knowing the correct answer is paramount, but knowing what the incorrect answers are is second best. Every single scientific advance in the past 400 years has been built upon countless and oftentimes undocumented fruitless searches.</p>
      <p>Every single failure just brings a scientist one step closer to a success. And every single failure is worth noting and understanding and disseminating and sharing. The goal of science is the exploration itself, not necessarily the result. So intensive work that leads to a blind alley isn't a waste of time - the goals of science it's still been advanced. Learning is still being achieved. Knowledge is still been acquired.</p>
      <p>In order to map the unknown and turn it into the known, there's bound to be a lot of effort spent in directions that do not ultimately lead to a satisfying conclusion. But that does not make them fruitless. If you're going to make a map, you won't just find the rivers and the passages, but also the blocked coves and the impassible mountains. It all goes together into a single body of knowledge.</p>
      <p>Blind alleys are nothing but. There's simply alleys.</p>
