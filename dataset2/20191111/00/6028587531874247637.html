      <p>As marketers move deeper into brand-funded content, how are they proving that their efforts are driving an increase in revenue for the brand’s core businesses?</p>
      <p>Fara Warner, award-winning author and journalist specializing in the art and science of storytelling in the digital age, recently delved into answering this pertinent question at Elevate 2019, Brand Storytelling’s premier Summer event for brand marketers and their partners.</p>
      <p>Warner has worked in every storytelling medium from traditional print, books, and digital publishing to virtual reality films throughout her three-decade journalism career. Most recently she served as the vice president and global editorial director of custom content at Dow Jones &amp; Company, where she helped lead a team that grew branded content revenue from $14 million to $60 million in three years.</p>
      <p>All of this made her uniquely qualified to interview a dozen brand marketers on the subject of measuring the success of their branded content campaigns. The results of these interviews were compiled into a <a href="https://www.brandstorytelling.tv/elevate-2019-white-papers">white paper authored by Warner</a>, who shared her findings at Elevate.</p>
      <p>The subjects she interviewed were candid about harboring a lack of trust for the numbers gleaned from data. Several shared the idea that somehow, in the pursuit to measure everything, it seems to have left them knowing nothing. Are impressions and views enough to measure? What else translates into actionable information? All questions shared by those interviewed by Warner.</p>
      <p>Brand Storytelling sat down with Warner at Elevate 2019, where she shared several key agreed-upon tenants for improving the methodology by which brand marketers measure their data:</p>
      <p>
        <b>What’s the Consensus?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Of the brand marketers that spoke with Fara Warner, one idea repeated over and over again was that of setting a common standard of measurement – or, at least, coming to a consensus on what that might look like. Finding a way to achieve consensus starts with determining what the working group is around measurement in relationship to brand storytelling. This mutually shared feeling is due in large part to a general misunderstanding and mistrust of some of the finer numbers.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What do the numbers really mean?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Another commonly raised issue amongst brand marketers was how to get to the nexus of the numbers in an unfiltered and simultaneously vetted way. The problem faced by many is that metrics beyond impressions and views need to be explained and validated by data analysts, leaving those responsible for evaluating KPI’s through those numbers feeling unsure of themselves. The question raised was how do brand marketers get 3<sup>rd</sup> party verification of those metrics? How do we get to that stage? Measurement companies old and new are involved and working to achieve measurement of the most valuable metric for brand storytellers: “sentiment”.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What are the comments telling me?</b>
      </p>
      <p>While brands and data companies work to determine how to measure sentiment the same way they measure impressions and views, many brands are simply taking a look at the comments. By sifting through negative comments and trolls to get to the genuine ones, comments have provided the kind of insight into whether or not a consumer was moved to action by a piece of brand-funded content that brand marketers and measurement firms alike are looking for.  </p>
      <p>
        <b>What do we need to do right now?</b>
      </p>
      <p>When asked what the most pertinent moves are to make right now, respondents agreed that creating “data chain,” or rather an ability to capture and understand data from end-to-end. This means being able to track a consumer from an initial viewing of a piece of branded content all the way through to purchase and beyond. Another must-have for brands to move forward in their measurement capabilities is ownership of their own data. Currently, social platforms only relinquish data they feel is pertinent to share. Brands disagree – they believe that they should have a window into every nuanced facet of their social media data in order to evaluate and improve campaigns.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Verdict?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Although there are a myriad of factors that will come into play as standards and practices in measurement shift for the better, in order to catalyze that process there must ultimately be consensus and collaboration amongst all the parties involved: Brand, client, platform, measurement company, and agency.</p>
