      <h1>Alton Lane’s Custom-Made Clothing Experience Fuels Its Brick-And-Mortar Success</h1>

      <p>A man walks into a small Manhattan showroom. He’s 23, just out of college, and wants to buy a $500 suit, says Peyton Jenkins, cofounder and president of custom clothier <a href="https://www.altonlane.com/">Alton Lane</a>. At the time, the company was only about two months old and occupied a 600-square-foot studio, so Jenkins was thrilled just to have the customer. “In his mind, he was king of the world—I think he left thinking ‘I’m probably their biggest customer,’” says Jenkins. About an hour later, in walked the head of strategy for one of the biggest US investment banks. He told Jenkins that he wanted the most expensive suit they sold. “He said, ‘I’ll buy one. If it works, I’ll be your customer forever. If it doesn’t work, I’m not going to be a fun customer.’ And we delivered for both of them,” says Jenkins.</p>

      <p>That day, says Jenkins, was when he and Colin Hunter, cofounder and CEO, realized that the Alton Lane model for selling men’s clothing was going to work. They’d have showrooms where customers could come in and meet with stylists, one on one. Instead of a store filled with racks and racks of suits, they’d make everything custom, using a combination of six measurements taken by a stylist and hundreds taken by a 3D body scanner.</p>
      <p>
        <b>A Tailored Experience</b>
      </p>
      <p>Alton Lane’s approach to personalization mirrors the expectations of today’s consumer, according to research from <a href="https://www.netsuite.com/portal/home.shtml?noredirect=T">Oracle NetSuite</a>, Wakefield Research, and The Retail Doctor. The <a href="https://www.netsuite.com/portal/assets/pdf/wp-future-of-retail.pdf?elqTrackId=af8904855d7c48a9adff845d928fc39b&amp;elqaid=3397&amp;elqat=2">recent study</a> of 1,200 consumers and 400 retail executives in the US, UK, and Australia uncovered what motivates different generations of shoppers, from Baby Boomers to Gen Z. The takeaway? Well, not only is brick and mortar not dead, but today’s “digital natives” want the in-store experience even more than older generations.</p>
      <p>Of those surveyed, 42% said they would pay more to have a more personalized shopping experience. Millennials in particular agreed with the statement, with 63% noting they would spend more for a personalized experience. In contrast, only 25% of Baby Boomers are willing to pay more.</p>
      <p>However, 44% of retailers surveyed said they are struggling to personalize customer experiences. For Alton Lane, this challenge was the starting point. To customize the experience, the founders turned to technology. For example, 3D scanners dramatically sped up clothing measurements, while a single platform managing all core business processes provided a consistent experience across locations and optimized the company’s global supply chain operations.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Just the Right Fit</b>
      </p>
      <p>Alton Lane began with orders written on paper, moved to spreadsheets on iPads, and then to an order form on its website. In 2012, with three years of success under its belt, the company still had too many data silos—measurement data stuck in 3D scanners, fit preferences on the iPads, order data at the factories, and customer data on notepads in showrooms. Jenkins and Hunter knew things had to change. To consolidate data, the retailer looked to NetSuite for a unified business platform that would deliver more visibility into the organization.</p>
      <p>“NetSuite really helped us understand the complexity of our business—we effectively run an international supply chain for every customer and have to deliver every time our customer wants access to that data in real time,” says Jenkins. “They want to know exactly where their clothes are at any step in the process.”</p>
      <p>The first priority was getting all of its customer and sales information into Oracle NetSuite, followed by integration of data from marketing campaigns, payments, and measurements. The most recent updates are Alton Lane’s most extensive yet, bringing together the app that stylists use when working with a customer and the company’s website into its NetSuite ecosystem. The company began realizing benefits instantly.</p>
      <p>“We have millions of garments we can make because of all the different style options and fabrics. NetSuite has been the ideal partner to help us handle this level of complexity, and we feel confident that with NetSuite we could scale to over $100 million in revenue and not need to make significant updates to the system, which is pretty cool,” Jenkins says. “NetSuite is the foundation of everything we do throughout our business. The fact that NetSuite is as strong as it is, and a part of the Oracle ecosystem, gives us a lot of faith that we're moving in parallel paths and have a partner we can grow with for a very long time.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Results Are Fitting</b>
      </p>
      <p>Alton Lane’s model may seem like a mismatch with the needs of the modern ‘I want exactly what I want and I want it now,’ consumer. However, the prevalence of online ordering seems to have made consumers more patient about when they receive goods, according to Greg Zakowicz, senior commerce marketing analyst at NetSuite. “Consumers don’t expect to get everything right this moment. For a lot of things, especially custom or high-end items, they’re fine if they get that in a few days or even longer,” says Zakowicz. The key is for retailers to create an in-store experience that optimizes both personalization and customer service.</p>
      <p>At its foundation, Alton Lane exemplifies this belief that the best way to get to know customers is in person. To make that happen, they have to create custom experiences that encourage prospects to make that first appointment, opening the door to creating a relationship that maximizes a customer's lifetime value to the company, rather than a short-term focus on a single sale. “We believe that great brands, brands that my kids or their kids will shop at, are built over decades and built on sustainable profits, not just on something that is hot and trendy at the time,” says Jenkins.</p>
