      <h1>All Aboard! American Railroads Are Ready To Roll Thanks To Impressive Tech Advances: Lance Fritz</h1>

      <p>Investors take note. The ultimate legacy industry, railroads, is barreling forward with cutting edge technological innovations and applications that will improve productivity, flexibility—and future profitability. Such advances will enable railroads to compete even more effectively with trucks and other modes of transportation. This is good news for future economic growth as better shipping and delivery improves productivity, enhances American competitiveness and gives us all a higher standard of living.</p>

      <p>Our conversational ride with Lance Fritz, chairman, president and chief executive officer of the storied Union Pacific (UP), the US’ largest railroad, couldn’t be more timely as he describes the exciting opportunities unfolding. Moreover, this year makes the 150th anniversary of when Leland Stanford hammered in the Golden Spike that tied together America’s east and west coasts through a transcontinental railroad system.</p>

      <p>But Fritz also warns there are potential obstacles that could slowdown or derail this train of progress, including unnecessary new regulations. More immediately, the various trade wars with other countries have taken their toll on shipments of freight. A quick resolution of these conflicts would fire up the volume of traffic.</p>
      <p>UP and other railroads are building on an already strong foundation. Many people don’t realize that since 1980, when this industry was largely liberated from the suffocating regulatory embrace of Washington, it has developed into the world’s best rail freight system, light years ahead of those of Europe and China. </p>
