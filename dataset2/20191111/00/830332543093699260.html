      <p>MADISON, Wis. - In an effort to empower women, artists raised funds through the Artful Women exhibit. Their artwork is displayed at University of Wisconsin Health.</p>
      <p>A reception Sunday honored the 46 artists, and based off a judge's opinion, some artists were given prizes. The art was judged on innovation, aesthetics and ideas.</p>
      <p>Mandy Kron, UW Health art coordinator, said the artwork gives women a voice. Money raised from the purchased art is given back to the artists and to the Wisconsin Women's Network, which is a nonprofit organization that works throughout Wisconsin to advance the lives of women and girls. </p>
      <p>"I think (the art exhibit) gets their message out to a lot of people," Kron said. "We have so many people coming through the hospital here that get to see that and hopefully know about the programs they do."</p>
      <p>People can buy the art at UW Health, where it'll be displayed until Dec. 6. </p>
