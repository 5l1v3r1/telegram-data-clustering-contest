      <h1>KR Market struggles to stay afloat</h1>

      <p>On Sunday when people stepped out to buy their weekly/ monthly necessities at the KR Market, they were forced to park their vehicles in the flooded parking lot, as it was waterlogged after heavy rain on Saturday night. <br/><br/>The basement parking lot can accommodate about 800 vehicles. <br/><br/>Visitors said that the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) had failed to maintain the parking space, despite them paying parking fees. <br/><br/>While the parking fee for four-wheelers is Rs 30, it is Rs 10 for two-wheelers. <br/><br/>Eshwarappa H, who is a regulator visitor at the market, said every time it rains heavily, the parking area gets flooded. <br/><br/>“There should be two sumps in working condition in the basement parking area to drain the water out when it rains and the area gets flooded. On Saturday, it started raining at 10 pm. They should have started draining the water out with the sumps at night itself but they did not do so. I was at the market around 1 pm on Sunday and the area was still waterlogged,” he said.</p>
      <p>The person who manages the parking facility had complained about its maintenance to the BBMP commissioner. He had asked us to send people to clean the area.</p>
      <p>– Nazima Khanam, KR Market corporator<br/><br/><br/>Visitors were forced to ride/drive through the waterlogged parking area. The pillion riders and other passengers were forced to get off at the entrance of the parking lot itself. <br/><br/>Shama, a visitor who had to wait with her daughter at the entrance of the parking lot as her husband had gone to park his bike, said she had little choice. <br/>Suresh Kumar, another visitor, said he found it difficult to park his vehicle in the basement. Getting it out of the basement was not a smooth task either and he had to request someone to help him to do so. <br/><br/>“Since I have an infection in my leg, I could not step into the water,” he said. <br/><br/>People who manage the parking area had also complained to the BBMP, but all in vain. Harish who manages the parking facility said that despite several complaints and requests, the BBMP had failed to maintain the space.</p>

      <p>Visitors said that the BBMP had failed to maintain the parking space, despite them paying parking fees, which is Rs 30 for four-wheelers and Rs 10 for two-wheelers</p>
      <p>“There is a slope in front the basement parking area and when it rains, water enters from both the sides and the area gets flooded. We drain out the water whenever it rains. There is no maintenance by the BBMP. We have complained to them about it but no action has been taken yet. In fact, they have an office right opposite the parking lot, but they have not bothered to fix the issue,” he said. <br/><br/>He added that they collect around Rs 5,000 as parking fees every day and hand the amount over to the BBMP. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, Nazima Khanam, KR Market ward Corporator, said she will look into the matter. <br/><br/>“The person who manages the parking facility had complained about its maintenance to the BBMP commissioner. He had asked us to send people to clean the area. I had also visited the place with the commissioner. We will take action immediately,” she said. <br/><br/><br/>Many areas in the city received heavy rainfall on Saturday night. <br/><br/>According to the MET department, the city received around 43 mm of rainfall. <br/><br/><br/>While Guttahalli received 53.5 mm of rainfall, Chamarajpet-52 mm and Vidyapeetha received 44 mm.</p>
