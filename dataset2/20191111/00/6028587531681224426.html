      <p>The home is decked out with Gaga-esque over-the-top features, including imported Italian doors with Swarovski crystal knobs, and its interiors are constructed almost entirely with glass walls and heated marble floors. The private two-car garage, for example, is separated from the home with a wall of glass, and brings vehicles up from the street level on a motorized lift to display them like art.</p>

      <p>Each of its six floors, meanwhile, are accessible via a glass elevator. On the first is a lobby with marble floors and 13-foot ceilings, along with the aforementioned two-car garage and a stadium-style screening room. (If you want to invite Bradley Cooper over for popcorn and an “A Star Is Born Movie Night,” his $13.5 million townhouse is <a href="https://streeteasy.com/blog/bradley-cooper-west-village-townhouse/">nearby in the West Village</a>, StreetEasy points out.) Below it, in the basement, is a 480-bottle temperature-controlled wine room, a swimming pool and a spa.</p>

      <p>The kitchen and dining area stretch from the second to the third floor, with an Italian Stella chandelier dangling between the two. Kitchen appliances are from Miele and Gaggenau, while its black marble counter tops are from Saint Laurent. Its adjoining living room is anchored by a DaVinci fireplace.</p>
