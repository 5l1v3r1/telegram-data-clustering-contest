      <p>TEHRAN, Iran (AP) - The Tehran publishers’ league in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/iran/">Iran</a> says it has outlawed buying or selling books by the bestselling Israeli author Yuval Noah Harari.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/iran/">Iran</a>’s culture ministry banned his books from publication in May. The ministry alleges they promote the theory of evolution and fabricate history.</p>
      <p>The official IRNA news agency reported Monday on the new warning by the publishers’ league of “possible” legal prosecution for selling Harari’s books.</p>
      <p>Hardliners in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/iran/">Iran</a> have long criticized the circulation of his books, calling him a Zionist.</p>
      <p>They’re concerned about the influence of Western culture, seeing it as part of efforts aimed at the “soft toppling” of the country’s Islamic system.</p>
