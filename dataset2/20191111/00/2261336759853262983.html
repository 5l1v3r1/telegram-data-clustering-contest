      <h1>YouTube star KSI says Logan Paul should face CM Punk in MMA following split decision result in Los Angeles</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T00:00:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Mckeever</a></address>
      <p>After fighting to a draw in a highly successful amateur boxing match in 2018, YouTube giants Logan Paul and KSI returned to the ring last night for a rematch at Staples Center in Los Angeles, California.</p>
      <p>Both men fought back-and-forth in a highly entertaining six-round contest, with KSI edging a split decision over Paul to win the fight. If Paul hadn’t been docked two points for landing an illegal strike in the fourth round, the American would have emerged victorious.</p>
      <p>Speaking in the post-fight interview, Paul called for a trilogy bout with KSI, claiming his two fights with the Brit rank amongst the best moments in his life.</p>
      <p>“Yeah, yeah I’d love to fight KSI. These are the best moments of my life, man. These are the best moments of my life,” Paul said.</p>

      <p>KSI, however, suggested his YouTube rival go on to fight former WWE superstar CM Punk under MMA rules.</p>
      <p>“Nah, nah, it’s done,” KSI responded. “It’s done fam. It is done. It is done, it is done. Done. I’m onto the next thing, yo. Hey, you could do MMA, with the wrestling and stuff. You should fight CM Punk. I think that’d be pretty fun.”</p>
      <p>Punk, who recently turned 41, made the transition to MMA in 2016 and fought under the UFC banner on two separate occasions, losing to Mickey Gall and Mike Jackson. The Duke Roufus product was subsequently released from the UFC, with Dana White claiming Punk — real name Phil Brooks — would never fight in the UFC again.</p>
