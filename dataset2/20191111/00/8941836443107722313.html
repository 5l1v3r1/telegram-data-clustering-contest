      <p>BANGKOK (AP) - A Thai court has issued arrest warrants for the former head of a major national park and three park employees accused of killing an ethnic Karen environmental activist.</p>
      <p>The Department of Special Investigation announced that a court for government officials approved the warrants on Monday in the case of Porlajee Rakchongcharoen, who was last seen in the custody of Kaeng Krachan National Park officials in western Thailand in April 2014.</p>
      <p>Porlajee, also known as Billy, had led the Karen community in a lawsuit against park chief Chaiwat Limlikitaksorn over his efforts to evict them by burning their homes inside the park. Chaiwat claimed Porlajee had been arrested for illegally collecting wild honey and had been released with a warning before disappearing.</p>
