      <h1>Watch SpaceX Launch 60 Starlink Satellites</h1>

      <h3>Mission Success</h3>
      <p>Just before 10 a.m. EST Monday morning, SpaceX launched a Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida.</p>
      <p>Its payload: 60 small satellites that will eventually team up with <a href="https://futurism.com/spacex-satellites-approval-fcc">thousands more</a> as part of the <a href="https://www.starlink.com/">Starlink constellation</a>, SpaceX’s plan to beam internet connectivity to the entire globe. The delivery mission, the company says, went off without a hitch.</p>

      <h3>Starlink Start</h3>
      <p>These aren’t the first Starlink satellites to reach Earth’s orbit. However, the <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/spacex-unleashes-starlink-satellites">batch of 60</a> SpaceX delivered in May were for testing purposes, while the latest 60 will be the first to contribute to the commercial Starlink network.</p>
      <p>That isn’t the only reason this launch was notable, either. It was the fourth flight for the mission’s Falcon 9 rocket booster — a SpaceX reusability record — and the successful recovery of the booster via a drone ship in the Atlantic Ocean means SpaceX could even use it again.</p>
      <p>The mission’s fairing was also used once previously, making this the first time any space company has reused a rocket’s nosecone.</p>

      <h3>The Road Ahead</h3>
      <p>SpaceX’s goal now is to complete five more similar launches of satellites, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/11/spacex-launches-re-flown-fairing-for-the-first-time-and-breaks-a-falcon-9-booster-re-use-record/">according to <i>TechCrunch</i></a>, so that it can begin providing customers in the U.S. and Canada with Starlink-powered internet service <a href="https://www.starlink.com/">in 2020</a>.</p>
      <p>After that, the company will continue to send more satellites into orbit for a total of <a href="https://spaceflightnow.com/2019/11/10/spacex-readies-upgraded-starlink-satellites-for-launch/">24 deployments</a>, with the goal of having the Starlink constellation ready to provide internet service globally in 2021.</p>
