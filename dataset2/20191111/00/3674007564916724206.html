      <p>The UK’s fastest growing nut butter brand Pip &amp; Nut is entering the premium impulse category with the launch of ‘all natural’ nut butter cups.</p>
      <p>Made using Pip &amp; Nut’s nut butter, each cup is wrapped in ethically sourced single origin Colombian chocolate supplied by Casa Luker.</p>
      <p>The company said the innovation follows consumer research that found over 50% of Pip &amp; Nut shoppers have a ‘sweet treat’ in the afternoons or evenings. According to feedback, 29% of Pip &amp; Nut consumers already eat nut butter cups. Pip &amp; Nut said this ‘showed a clear opportunity to disrupt the category and the conventional confectionery brands that reside within it’.</p>
      <p>Founder, Pippa Murray, commented: <i>“Time and time again we had consumers asking us to make nut butter cups, in fact some of our most engaged Instagram posts on Pip &amp; Nut’s Instagram were those featuring nut butter cups. So, after listening to our community of fans we are so pleased to present our very own range of Nut Butter Cups. Over the last five years we’ve perfected the primary ingredient, nut butter, so it feels like a no brainer for us to bring our expertise in nut butter to this new product range and category.”</i>​</p>
      <p>Available in three variants - milk chocolate peanut butter cup, dark chocolate peanut butter cup and dark chocolate almond butter cup - each 34g pack contains two cups.</p>
      <p>The brand has secured strong early listings with Boots, Ocado and Wholefoods as well as independents nationwide.</p>

      <p>Announcing the launch, Minor Figures said it has spent ‘years’ developing the recipe. The company claimed it is the ‘first alternative to milk’ to maintain the ‘same stability for froths and foams’ that baristas look for.</p>
      <p><i>“Given our background in speciality coffee we wanted to design and develop a product that allows baristas to easily enhance their customers coffee drinking experience,”</i>​ co-founder of Minor Figures, Stuart Forsyth commented.</p>
      <p>According to the company, the oat milk produces a ‘silky micro-foam’ when steamed. It doesn’t split in acidic espresso.</p>
      <p>The milk alternative is already stocked at Whole Foods Market, Planet Organic, As Nature Intended, Sourced Market and nationally via www.minorfigures.com.</p>

      <h3>Natur Boutique's healthy herbal teas</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Herbal tea specialists Natur Boutique has added three new drinks to its range: organic burdock root, passion flower and bitter melon.</p>
      <p>While the company is not making any direct health claims about the teas, it did say the ‘unusual’ varieties were inspired by research on the benefits of the ingredients.</p>
      <p>Passion flower is perhaps the best known of these ingredients and is linked to sleep and relaxation, but whilst other companies have utilised passion flower in blends, Natur Boutique’s tea represents one of the first to market to offer a single ingredient option.</p>
      <p>Natur Boutique’s burdock root product will be the first organic version available in the UK. Burdock has been associated with a number of potential benefits, including helping with osteoarthritis.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, bitter melon has been linked to the potential benefits for people with diabetes.</p>
      <p><i>“We’ve spent a long time looking for teas to add to our range that we genuinely believe in and we’re delighted with the trio we’ve chosen. I believe all three bring something new and add genuinely unique products to the herbal tea category,”</i>​ Anton Le Khak, director at Natur Boutique, commented.</p>
      <p>The new products are currently available from The Health Store and CLF.</p>
