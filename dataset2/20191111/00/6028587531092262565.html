      <p>Craig Counsell and Christian Yelich will find out this week if they've won some new hardware.Both are <a href="https://bbwaa.com/19-award-index/">finalists for awards handed out annually by the Baseball Writers Association of America</a>; Counsell for the National League Manager of the Year honors and Yelich for the league's Most Valuable Player.</p>
      <p>Yelich, 27, is going for a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewwagner/2018/11/16/yelich-caps-off-whirlwind-year-with-mvp-honors/#2d92da0c1e97">repeat victory</a>. He became the fourth Brewers player to win an MVP after putting together a historic season and led Milwaukee to within a game of the World Series. </p>
      <p>Despite coming into the 2019 season with lofty expectations, Yelich set career-highs in just about every major offensive category, starting with a .329 average, which also earned him a second consecutive NL batting crown. He also finished with a .429 on-base percentage, .671 slugging percentage and 1.100 OPS while hitting 44 home runs and stealing 30 bases, making him just the 10th player in baseball history to put together a 40/30 season.</p>
      <p>He did all that despite missing Milwaukee's final 19 games after fracturing his kneecap when he fouled a pitch off his knee during the first inning of a Sept. 10 game at Miami. In all, Yelich played in 130 games this season.</p>
      <p>Yelich has already been honored with the Hank Aaron Award as the National League's best offensive player, the Silver Slugger Award as one of the league's top offensive outfielders and was named the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewwagner/2019/10/31/christian-yelich-earns-second-straight-mvp-honor-in-local-bbwaa-voting/#6f82c0165f46">Brewers' Most Valuable Player by members of the Milwaukee Chapter of the BBWAA</a>.</p>
      <p>Along with Yelich, Dodgers outfielder Cody Bellinger and Nationals third baseman Anthony Rendon are also finalists for the award.</p>
      <p>Yelich’s presence in the lineup made things easy for Counsell, who is a finalist for the second straight season after Milwaukee finished 89-73 and earned one of the two NL Wild Card spots before falling to Washington.</p>
      <p>And just like last season, when the Brewers surged into the postseason with a tremendous showing over the final month, Counsell again utilized expanded rosters for another comeback down the stretch.</p>
      <p>Milwaukee sat 6.5 games out of first place in the NL Central and four games out of the second NL Wild Card spot at the start of September. The Brewers went 20-7 the rest of the way — despite playing a majority of those games without Yelich — to clinch a playoff spot for a second consecutive season — and still had a chance to catch the Cardinals for a second straight division crown heading into the final weekend of the regular season.</p>
      <p>Counsell would be the first Brewers manager to win the award. He <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewwagner/2018/11/13/craig-counsell-finishes-second-in-nl-manager-of-the-year-voting/#16f3cf141d5b">finished second last season to Atlanta’s Brian Snitker</a>, who is also a finalist in 2019 along with Mike Shildt of the Cardinals.</p>
      <p>The award winners will be announced starting Monday with the Rookie of the Year winners. Managers will be announced Tuesday, Nov. 12, Cy Young Winners on Wed., Nov. 13 with the MVP announcements set for Thursday, Nov. 14.</p>
      <p>Each announcement will be broadcast on MLB Network.</p>
