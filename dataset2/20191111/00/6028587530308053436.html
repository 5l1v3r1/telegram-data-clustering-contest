      <p>The hottest viral catchphrase used by Generation Z today will make fun of baby boomers - and may also trigger your Google Home. Various <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/duptsx/google_home_mini_new_command_ok_boomer/">Redditors</a> and YouTubers have noticed that saying “Ok boomer” or “Hey Boomer” will trigger Google Assistant to activate on their Assistant-enabled speakers.</p>
      <p>While Google Assistant will wake up after it hears the phrase, the device will not actually respond to requests after hearing “Ok boomer.”</p>
      <p>It is likely that the device is being triggered with the phrase because of a “false accept,” said a Google spokesperson. The spokesperson said that there may be noise or words in the background that Google’s software has interpreted to be a hot word that would activate the device, like “Ok Google.” The company added that the company has protections in place from preventing false accepts from happening while using Assistant.</p>
      <p>Both Google and boomer have the same “oo” sound contained within both words, which may be triggering a false accept. Other Redditors have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/7soxrx/egg_noodle_will_work_as_a_wake_word/">noticed</a> that words like “egg noodle” and “poodle” have successfully activated their device.</p>
      <p>“Ok boomer” is a popular <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/29/style/ok-boomer.html">catchphrase</a> with Generation Z (the age group of 7-year-olds to 22-years-old), used when expressing their frustration with something said by an older person.</p>
