        <b>Thousands of UK workers will enjoy a pre-Christmas pay bump if their employer is a member of the "real living wage" campaign.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Businesses who have signed up to the voluntary scheme will lift their UK hourly rate by 30p to £9.30.</p>
      <p>People living in London will see their hourly pay rise by 20p to £10.75.</p>
      <p>The scheme is separate to the statutory National Living Wage for workers aged 25 and above which currently stands at £8.21 an hour.</p>
      <p>The Living Wage Foundation said its "real" pay rate - which applies to all employees over 18 - is calculated independently and is based on costs such as food, clothing and household bills.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.livingwage.org.uk/good-for-business">Some 6,000 organisations are now signed up to the scheme</a>, including new members Crystal Palace Football Club, insurer Hiscox, Welsh Water and London City Airport.</p>
      <p>They join existing members such as Burberry, the luxury fashion company, and West Ham United Football Club.</p>
      <p>The Living Wage Foundation said around 210,000 workers will benefit from the increase.</p>

      <p>New research by accountancy firm KPMG suggests that the number of UK jobs paying less than the "real living wage" has fallen over the past year from 22% to 19%.</p>
      <p>However, it said 5.2 million jobs pay below the "real" living rate.</p>
      <p>The National Living Wage is a key campaign issue as the UK heads towards the general election on 12 December.</p>
      <p>An independent report, commissioned by the former Chancellor Philip Hammond, concluded that raising the National Living Wage would have little impact on jobs.</p>
      <p>The Conservative Party has promised to increase the National Living Wage to £10.40 by 2024 and to lower the minimum age to 21.</p>
      <p>Labour said it will immediately lift the hourly rate to £10 for everyone aged 16 and over if they win the election.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage-rates">Under the current arrangement</a>, workers under 18 are paid £4.35 an hour.</p>
      <p>At the weekend, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon accused the Tories of short-changing young people with a "discriminatory" minimum wage policy.</p>
      <p>She said the SNP will demand an end to the "rip-off" of workers aged under 25.</p>
      <p>Katherine Chapman, director of the Living Wage Foundation, said while it is "fantastic" there is so much focus on wages: "We have always been working with businesses to take action now rather than waiting for legislation."</p>
      <p>Pam Batty, vice president of corporate responsibility at Burberry, said: "We are calling on all companies to join the pledge, as we know it will meaningfully improve the lives of their people, who are their most valuable asset."</p>
