      <h1>For Biotech CFOs, the Realm of Rare Diseases Is Often Ripe for Pivots</h1>

      <p>It seems that at every industry conference these days, you can find an entrepreneurial C-suite member regaling audiences with tales of the strategic decisions that permitted their companies to advance across a high wire to success.The span is just as high and just as long for biotech CFOs, but perhaps with a pivot or two more—or at least that is the case in the world of rare-disease remedies, where out of the nearly 7,000 documented rare afflictions, fewer than 400 are reported to currently have a treatment.</p>
      <p>It’s such a wide spectrum of opportunity that it requires today’s responsible biotech management to routinely revisit the question of which diseases their future treatments will focus on.</p>

      <p>The risk and rewards to that question are plentiful. Treatments for rare diseases, so-called orphan drugs, are granted generous incentives by federal lawmakers. Authorities grant orphan drugs market exclusivity similar to a patent without the lengthy regulatory process. The global orphan drug market is expected to climb nearly 60% between 2015 and 2022, reaching $169 billion, according to a report by Allied Market Research. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved over 770 rare disease treatments since the enactment of the Orphan Drug act in 1983.</p>
      <p>A blockbuster drug – like erectile dysfunction treatment Viagra or statin Lipitor — can rev up sales and send a company’s shares soaring. Medications for rare diseases, however, offer limited patient pools for clinical trials and market growth. And many start-up biotech companies tie their fortunes to a limited pipeline of potential treatments and live or die by the outcome of the FDA approval process.    </p>
      <p>At ProQR Therapeutics, a Netherlands-based biotech company, reexamining their product pipeline left little doubt in the minds of management that a pivot was in order,</p>

      <p>according to CFO Smital Shah, who says that ProQR subsequently underwent “a soup-to-nuts” transformation and refocused its offerings on rare diseases in ophthalmology.</p>
      <p>Shah says that this sea change involved making crucial hires. Those included a new head of R&amp;D in 2017 with expertise in rare diseases and a chief medical officer earlier this year with three decades of experience in ophthalmology, the field of medicine concerned with disorders and diseases of the eye. </p>
      <p>According to Shah, the decision was a “seminal moment” in the company’s history: “It meant taking a different road and going into a realm of diseases that no one had ever addressed before. These were smaller populations in a different therapeutic area, where the shareholders interested in investing with us would also be different.”</p>
      <p>Marc Schegerin, CFO of ArQule in Cambridge, Mass., says that while one of its lead programs showed promise in addressing multiple diseases, the company had to decide where to invest its limited resources.</p>
      <p>“We don’t have the funds to do studies on every possible disease for which this drug could work,” he says declining to give specifics of the treatment. “So we have to choose.”</p>
      <p>He added that in making the decision it’s not immediately clear whether they should focus on an area with a broader application but more competition or target an area that “might be a little bit smaller but where we can be first and best.”</p>
      <p>ProQR grappled with a similar decision. Shah explains that the move to sharpen its focus on ophthalmology diseases came in response to a market shift that increased competition.</p>
      <p>“The competitive landscape for the disease that we were working to treat evolved,” Shah says. “We were no longer going to be the first to treat it, and we were instead going face stiff competition for resources.”</p>
      <p>Shah says that it wasn’t just company officials who had to be convinced to pivot. Investors had to also literally buy-in, she says. “Investors had to consider whether they wanted to put capital into the original area as opposed to putting capital into something where the competitive pressure would be far lower and the impact could be broader, ” says Shah, who also serves as ProQR’s chief business officer.</p>
      <p>CFO Schegerin is also ArQule’s head of strategy—a leadership position pairing that he believes allows him to approach decisions from multiple sides.</p>
      <p>Deciding where to aim the company’s focus requires “strategic thinking that goes beyond the numbers,” he explains. “This is certainly right at the forefront of what we do here and where we have to kind of tease out how much money may be required.” Schegerin holds both a medical degree and an MBA.</p>
      <p>“When we’re thinking about where we may want to be down the road and where we want to make the biggest impact, we have to decide now because we may need to start a trial in disease X as opposed to disease Y,” he reasons.</p>
      <p>Shah also sees the melding of finance and strategy in ProQR’s decision to pivot its product focus.</p>
      <p>“To me, this transition from what we had focused on to where we are right now reveals a strong collaboration between the strategy and finance sides of the business,” she says.</p>
