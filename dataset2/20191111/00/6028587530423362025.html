      <p>Walgreens Boots Alliance is taking steps to educate the public and investors about the pharmacy chain’s differences with drug wholesalers and distributors like its partner AmerisourceBergen as opioid litigation intensifies.<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2013/03/19/walgreens-amerisourcebergen-play-creates-worlds-largest-drug-buyer/#2840642028ed">In 2013, Walgreens signed a 10-year agreement </a>with AmerisourceBergen that included “pharmaceutical distribution.” That deal also included Walgreens getting the right to purchase a “minority equity position” in AmerisourceBergen. “In May 2016, certain of these agreements were extended for three years and are now expected to expire in 2026,” Walgreens said <a href="https://s1.q4cdn.com/343380161/files/doc_financials/2019/q4/10-K.pdf">in a filing last month with the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission.</a></p>
      <p>Three giant wholesalers, including AmerisourceBergen, last month <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/21/health/opioid-settlement.html">agreed to pay $215 million</a> to two Ohio counties and avoid the first federal opioid trial that was scheduled to begin, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/21/health/opioid-settlement.html">New York Times report said.</a> Walgreens owns 27% of AmerisourceBergen, according to its <a href="https://s1.q4cdn.com/343380161/files/doc_financials/2019/q4/10-K.pdf">most recent 10K filing </a>with the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission.</p>
      <p>But Walgreens said it is “completely unlike the wholesalers involved in the national opioid litigation.”</p>
      <p>“Before 2014, we delivered opioid medications – among many other types of medications – only to our own pharmacies, staffed by our own pharmacy professionals,” a Walgreens spokesman said last week in a statement that followed a Washington Post story linking the company to the opioid crisis and financial reports discussing the company’s potential opioid-related liability. “We never sold opioid medications to pain clinics, internet pharmacies or the ‘pill mills’ that fueled the national opioid crisis.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2019/11/07/opioid-litigation-looms-over--walgreens-lbo/#eca9f5c6d881">Several reports emerged</a> last week that Walgreens is considering a leveraged buyout that would take the global drugstore chain private. Following those reports, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2019/11/07/opioid-litigation-looms-over--walgreens-lbo/#eca9f5c6d881">some analysts said</a> opioid litigation and a potential payout by Walgreens to settle such cases could play into any decision of private equity firms looking to finance a leveraged buyout of the global drugstore chain.</p>
      <p>What’s more, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2019/11/07/height-crisis-walgreens-handled-nearly-one-five-most-addictive-opioids/?arc404=true">the investigative report in the Washington Post</a> said Walgreens “handled nearly one in five of the most addictive opioids” at the peak of the crisis surrounding the painkiller and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-health-202/2019/11/08/the-health-202-here-s-why-walgreens-may-be-in-more-legal-jeopardy-in-opioid-lawsuits/5dc46da1602ff1184c316360/">acted as its “own distributor.”</a> That story comes as drug makers and wholesalers begin to settle litigation linking healthcare companies to the opioid crisis.</p>
      <p>For its part, Walgreens is now taking steps to speak out about the differences between wholesalers that have already begun to settle opioid cases.</p>
      <p>“We never manufactured prescription opioid medications,” the Walgreens spokesman said. “We never marketed or promoted opioid medications. We never prescribed any opioid medications. Walgreens was not a wholesaler of opioid medications.”</p>
      <p>It wasn’t long ago that speculation emerged Walgreens wanted to own all of the global wholesaler and distributor AmerisourceBergen. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/walgreens-has-made-takeover-approach-to-amerisourcebergen-1518480542">The Wall Street Journal reported</a> in February of last year that Walgreens made a “takeover approach" to the global drug distributor AmerisourceBergen.</p>
      <p>Such speculation about Walgreens going private or buying the rest of AmerisourceBergen that the retail drugstore chain doesn’t already comes amid rampant consolidation in the healthcare industry with Walgreens rival CVS Health a year ago buying Aetna, the No. 3 health insurer in the U.S. for $69 billion.</p>
      <p>Buying the rest of AmerisourceBergen is seen by some as a potential play by Walgreens to cut off an avenue for <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2018/02/12/as-amazon-looms-walgreens-may-buy-giant-distributor-amerisourcebergen/#131f22fc1188">Amazon given the distributor's global ties</a> to healthcare companies and supply channels around the world. AmerisourceBergen has more than 150 offices around the world and ships millions of products each day, the company's website notes. </p>
      <p>In recent years, however, Walgreens appears to have resisted pressure from some investors and Wall Street analysts to buy out the remaining majority stake in AmerisourceBergen that the drugstore chain doesn’t already own. Walgreens hasn’t made a large investment to increase its stake in AmerisourceBergen since 2016, a company spokesman and SEC filings indicate.</p>
      <p>“As of August 31, 2019, the Company owned 56,854,867 AmerisourceBergen common shares representing approximately 27% of the outstanding AmerisourceBergen common stock and has designated one member of AmerisourceBergen’s board of directors,” Walgreens Boots Alliance most recent 10K filed last month with the SEC says. “As of August 31, 2019, the Company can acquire up to an additional 8,398,752 AmerisourceBergen shares in the open market and thereafter designate another member of AmerisourceBergen’s board of directors, subject in each case to applicable legal and contractual requirements.”</p>
