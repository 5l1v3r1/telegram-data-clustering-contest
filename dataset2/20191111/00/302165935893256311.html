      <p>PARIS, Nov 11 — Thousands marched through Paris yesterday in an anti-Islamophobia demonstration that has divided France’s political class.</p>
      <p>Organisers said they had called the rally in a sign of support two weeks after a man with far-right connections fired shots in a mosque in the southwestern city of Bayonne, injuring two elderly men.</p>
      <p>Members of hard-left parties took part in the march — though some others in the centre stayed away saying it threatened France’s tradition of secularism, and far right leader Marine Le Pen said the event had been organised by Islamists.</p>
      <p>Crowds walked through the capital waving banners marked with the messages “Stop all racism” and “Islamophobia is not an opinion but a crime” at the event organised by the Collectif Contre l’Islamophobie en France.</p>
      <p>“It’s up to us to demonstrate after an event like Bayonne to ensure the freedom of religion and thought that goes with it,” the head of the far left France Unbowed party, Jean-Luc Melenchon, told journalists.</p>
      <p>But the state secretary in charge of fighting discrimination, Marlene Schiappa, had said the demonstration was a protest against secularism “under the disguise of fighting discrimination”.</p>
      <p>More than 40 per cent of Muslims said they had felt religious discrimination in France, according to a survey by Ifop earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Islam is the second biggest religion in France, which has the biggest Muslim minority in Western Europe.</p>
      <p>Last month, a member of Le Pen’s National Rally party fuelled an ongoing debate about the position of Muslims and Muslim symbols in France by publicly telling a woman to remove her headscarf. — Reuters</p>
