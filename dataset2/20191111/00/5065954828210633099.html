      <p>BAGUIO CITY—The iconic and century-old 34-hectare Burnham Park, along with other tourist spots in the country’s summer capital, will be closed for rehabilitation starting next year, the city’s chief executive said over the weekend.</p>
      <p>Baguio City Mayor Benjamin Magalong said he is already in talks with the Department of Tourism (DOT) as the national government has set its sights on rehabilitating the summer capital after the world-famous Boracay Island.</p>
      <p>“[Burnham Park] is an icon; it’s a landmark. Everyone who goes up to Baguio, they never fail to go to Burnham Park. Baguio is synonymous with Burnham Park,” Magalong told the BusinessMirror in an interview.</p>
      <p>He said Burnham Park will be closed, starting March 2020 next year to October. The DOT, Magalong said, has already allotted funds for the rehabilitation of the park.</p>
      <p>Named after American urban planner Daniel Burnham, the park is home to the Burnham Lake, Children Playground, Skating Rink, Rose Garden, Orchidarium, Igorot Park, Melvin Jones Grandstand, Athletic Bowl, Picnic Grove, Japanese Peace Tower, Pine Trees of the World and Sunshine Park.</p>
      <p>“The rehabilitation of the park will take about 8 months and cost P500 million as we want to make sure that it will not be flooded anymore. We will prioritize the rehabilitation of the drainage system, which will cost P100 million and is not part of the P500 million,” he said.</p>
      <p>Aside from fixing the drainage system of the famous landmark in Baguio¸ Magalong said the city government also wants to establish parking buildings using green architecture. Another tourist spot that will be rehabilitated is the Baguio City night market. Magalong said this will be done in phases. Rehabilitation would cost at least P5 billion and would take two to three years.</p>
      <p>“It looks clean now but the city government can only do so much. Baguio still has one of the worst markets in the entire country. We are going to rehabilitate it. It will be one of the best markets in the Philippines after we rehabilitate it,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mines View Park, Magalong said, may be closed sooner than Burnham Park as bidding for the P18-million rehabilitation project is already ongoing.</p>
      <p>Asked about the fate of vendors in the famous Baguio tourist spots, he said: “They would just have to bite the bullet.</p>
      <p>We cannot just permit people to do business there just because they want to,” he said.</p>
      <p>Magalong said he has plans of organizing ambulant vendors into cooperatives.</p>
      <p>“Baguio’s problems are so complicated that political will is badly needed to address these problems,” Magalong said.</p>
      <h3>Smart city</h3>
      <p>He revealed that the local government has already received its fund request of P200 million from President Duterte for the first phase of the project which will turn Baguio into a smart city, the first of its kind in the country.</p>
      <p>With a command center using artificial intelligence, the mayor said that the local government would soon be able to strictly monitor the movements of people and cars to better manage the traffic flow. It would also help the city cut its expenses on lighting and improve water management.</p>
      <p>“That is why from a safer city, we want Baguio to be known as a smart city. Later on, the use of technology will be used as platform for digital transformation, for digital governance and the shift to a digital economy,” he said.</p>
      <p>The smart city project is targeted to be completed by July next year, according to Magalong.</p>
      <p>He said the local government is already receiving proposals from various foreign companies, such as Huawei, Cisco, China Telecom, and those from Japan and Russia.</p>
      <p>Magalong made an assurance that the local government will put enough safeguards, such as double data encryption, to allay concerns over Baguio’s transformation into a smart city.</p>
      <p>He also said the city government is currently working on a master plan to rehabilitate parks and put up satellite markets to decongest Baguio’s sole night market.</p>
      <p>“Our vision is to turn Baguio in to a walkable city that is why we are spending a lot on quality sidewalks,” said Magalong.</p>
