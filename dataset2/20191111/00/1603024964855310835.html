      <p>The future of Japan's regional lenders is a focus for investors after years of negative interest rates and a declining population have sapped profits and raised questions about their ability to survive.</p>
      <p>The news sent Fukushima Bank's shares up by their daily limit, or 32.9% higher, earlier in the session. The stock was last up 29.2%, while SBI Holdings fell 0.2%. The broader market was little changed.</p>
      <p>SBI announced in September it would invest in Shimane Bank Ltd , a regional bank in western Japan.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
