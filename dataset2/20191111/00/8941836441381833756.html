      <p>PHOENIX (AP) - A Dec. 17 sentencing hearing has been scheduled for an Arizona man convicted of making false statements to FBI agents during the investigation of the 2015 attack on a Prophet Muhammad cartoon contest in suburban Dallas.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/abdul-khabir-wahid/">Abdul Khabir Wahid</a> was found guilty this summer of making false statements to agents and tampering with a witness.</p>
      <p>Even though his bench trial was reopened earlier this month to let <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/abdul-khabir-wahid/">Wahid</a> question a witness, his verdict remained unchanged.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/abdul-khabir-wahid/">Wahid</a> was a friend of Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi, who were killed by police after the pair opened fire outside the anti-Islam event in Garland.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/abdul-khabir-wahid/">Wahid</a> testified at the trial of Abdul Malik Abdul Kareem, who was convicted for giving guns to Simpson and Soofi.</p>
