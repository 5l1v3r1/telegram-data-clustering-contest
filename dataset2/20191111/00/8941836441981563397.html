      <p>FLORENCE, Italy (AP) - Italy coach Roberto Mancini says he prefers to recall Mario Balotelli for his qualities as a player, not as a message against racism.</p>
      <p>Balotelli has not been called up by Mancini in more than a year but Italian soccer federation president Gabriele Gravina has said naming him in the squad would send a strong message after the Brescia forward was racially abused recently.</p>
      <p>Mancini said Monday that “if Balotelli gets another chance, it will be because he deserves it from a technical point of view.”</p>
      <p>Balotelli was included in Mancini’s first two squads but again was omitted from upcoming European qualifiers against Bosnia-Herzegovina and Armenia.</p>
      <p>Balotelli has long said his goal is to rejoin the national team for next year’s European Championship.</p>
