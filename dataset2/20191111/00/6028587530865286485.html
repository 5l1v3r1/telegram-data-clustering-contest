      <p>Winter has its perennials: wool scarves, snug sweaters and boots of any kind. And no other fashion item encapsulates the season—and brings together all the aforementioned layers—more than a chic camel coat. Its sandy hue acts as a neutral base, allowing for what’s underneath to pop while also highlighting the rich colors of autumn leaves.</p>
      <p>Whether you dress it up with a navy suit and loafers for a day at the office, or down with jeans and a pair of high-tops for a weekend outing with the boys, a great camel coat is versatile enough to work in myriad situations. Here are some of the best of the season that are well worth the investment</p>

      <p>From the streamlined profile to the pronounced gold buttons with the “4G” logo, this camel coat from the French label Givenchy is elegance personified. Factor in the structured shoulders and jacquard lining and this cashmere-blend topper by designer Clare Waight Keller is a must-have for anyone looking for a high dose of, as the French say, éclat.</p>

      <p>Loro Piana is the quintessential cold-weather brand. So much so that many other labels boast of how they source materials from this storied Italian wool purveyor, creating quality pieces made of the finest cashmere and other plush knits. Just take a look at the Livingstone coat—with its parka-style silhouette oversized pockets and striking suede collar—and understand why Loro Piana has such a great reputation.</p>

      <p>French and Italian brands are considered to be the pinnacle in the fashion industry. And though there is some truth to that statement, don’t discount the output of stateside labels. Schott NYC, in particular, has shown how the U.S. contingent is worthy of the same praise as its foreign brethren—evidenced by this slick wool camel coat with a distinct collar and brown buttons.</p>

      <p>Want to take your wardrobe to the next level? Look no further than Saint Laurent, one of the menswear industry’s buzziest brands. Designer Anthony Vaccarello imbues his collection with a rock ’n’ roll, making it a go-to for those that prescribe to that vibe. With this Tailored Car Coat, however, he stuck to a more en masse sensibility with a fitted silhouette that appeals to anyone who values quality. Make sure to take it for a spin.</p>
