      <h1>Support The Military — And Your Skin — With Grooming Brand Bravo Sierra This Veteran’s Day</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T00:00:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Celia Shatzman</a></address>
      <p>When you buy something, no matter what it is, it always gives you peace of mind to know it’s been tried and tested. New grooming line Bravo Sierra is taking that to the next level—every single item has been developed and approved with feedback from the US military, with more than 1,000 U.S. Special Operations Forces serving as the incubator. “Our idea was to say we’re going to build a company that’s native to the military community,” says Bravo Sierra Founder and Co-CEO Justin Guilbert. “For active military service members, we’re giving them priority access. We felt this was more than giving back because we’re developing a business, and at the same time, we felt as a DNA, the military would inspire a lot of people. If it’s stress tested with them, field tested for them and delivers, it’s a way to get a validation from a community without having to create a BS marketing story behind it.”</p>

      <p>Bravo Sierra developed a unique revenue share model that gives 5% of all sales to the Morale Welfare and Recreation (MWR) programs, a government organization dedicated to the well-being of US military service members, veterans and their families, offering community support and quality of life programs at more than 2,000 facilities on U.S. military bases throughout the world. Bravo Sierra products are available to military service members at Army, Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy bases worldwide, as well as sold direct-to-consumer on <a href="https://www.bravosierra.com/">bravosierra.com</a>. To reach the widest audience possible, everything in the line is priced from $5 to $14. “Instead of selling it for $50 a pop to a marginal group of consumers, let’s make it available to the broadest set we can,” Guilbert says. “A lot of people keep telling us you could charge [much more], but we wouldn’t get the same volume or the same amount of people seeing our brand. Our goal is to be part of the great American consumer brands that will unify people.”</p>
      <p>The unisex line is comprised of eight products: Antibacterial body wipes, an all-in-one hair/body/face wash, shaving foam, deodorant, hair paste, face moisturizer, face sunscreen and lip balm. “We want to go back to the basics staples of active lifestyles, which are shaving, showering and grooming,” says Bravo Sierra Founder and Co-CEO Benjamin Bernet. But developing these products for military use meant approaching it from a different angle, since many service members aren’t shaving in their bathroom at home in front of a big mirror and a sink, for example. If they’re deployed, they may not have access to hot water. “We really have a product that delivers in efficiency and their needs,” Bernet says. “We put them to the most extreme conditions, from climate to dryness of skin.” To ensure all of the products are up to snuff, Bravo Sierra now has their own software platform to receive feedback in real time so that they can test products on a larger scale. While they were developing the line, when they received feedback through questionnaires, they would go back to the lab to reformulate until they nailed it.</p>

      <p>Bravo Sierra has introduced several first-to-market technologies, including biodegradable antibacterial “tactical shower” body wipes; the first foam-to-cream shaving technology; and the first non-flammable, hydrocarbon-free propellant. Not only are those good for your skin, but they’re also good for the environment. “That’s an example of how we take pain points coupled with our experience in R&amp;D and create something disrupting,” Guilbert says. “When we approached the military with the first hydrocarbon-free propellant, they were blown away. Sustainability is not something that should be the privilege of the few who have the education or desire, it should be readily accessible.”</p>

      <p>Additionally, all products are clean, vegan, cruelty-free and formulated without parabens, phthalates, SLS/SLES or phenoxyethanol. All packaging components are Cradle-to-Cradle certified, plus it’s made in the US from start to finish, which also allows them to be familiar with every rung in the supply chain. “I have been developing beauty products for past 15 years and it’s a lot more interesting and rewarding to work with people when you can visit their lab and establish a relationship,” says Bernet, who formally ran Kiehl’s. “Another reason to stay in the US is being mindful of sustainability. Why carry heavy shower gels from Asia or wherever with a significant carbon foot print when you don’t have to? And third, it’s important for us, in a more community-oriented way, to manufacture here in US with companies based in areas that are not booming economically, like in Ohio. Let’s stimulate these areas; it’s a win-win for everyone.”</p>

      <p>For Guilbert and Bernet, the military is the “original wellness lifestyle,” so it doesn’t get any more authentic than having service members help create the products. “The idea behind wellness is you’re the best version of yourself, physically and mentally,” Guilbert says. “The active duty deployed military has no choice but to be at their best, and sharpest and strongest. They do stuff no one in Hollywood would dare to try. Wellness today is all about you, you, you. Their physical and mental abilities and training make them elite in their world; they are peak and able to work as a group. Once you’ve achieved that wellness, it’s what do you do with it. The military is committed to service and doing it for the greater good—it’s the American ideal.”</p>
