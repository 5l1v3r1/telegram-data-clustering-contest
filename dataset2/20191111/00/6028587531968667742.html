      <p>Just a few quotes about sustainability from two of the partipating designers:</p>
      <p>
        <i>Katey Brunini; “Sustainability is a symbiotic relationship between man and nature. Mining is a touchy subject in the jewelry industry, and it can be argued that artisanal production by indigenous people is the answer to third world development and global sustainability. Being related to small production, alluvial mining, and collection rather than mass conglomerates. There is no pure answer but If we take, we must give back.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Feng J: “<i>Sustainability is a choice, an attitude, and responsibility for the world. To me, it’s a sense of mindfulness in my creations. jewelry piece with Aesthetic sense, superior craftsmanship and a good meaning to the environment is a collectable for the future.”</i></p>
