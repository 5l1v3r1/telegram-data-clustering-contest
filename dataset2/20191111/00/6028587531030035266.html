      <p>We might be moving on through to Black Friday and holiday shopping season, but the last 2019 fall release season has a few big titles left in it yet. There’s <i>Pokemon Sword </i>and <i>Shield</i>, due out for the Switch, and there’s <i>Jedi: Fallen Order</i>, one of the most hotly-anticipated AAA titles this year and the biggest Star Wars game since the somewhat problematic launch of <i>Star Wars Battlefront 2</i>. Here’s what you need to know as we move forward to launch about the release date and the review embargo. First off: the game comes out on November 15, 2019, on Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and PC. We’ll get to know what critics think at exactly that time, according to Metacritic:</p>
      <p>That means that reviews are timed with launch, which I’ve seen some people suggest means that EA doesn’t have faith in the game. I would definitely not read too much into that decision: review embargoes happen for any number of reasons, from marketing strategy to technical limitations and more. I’ve seen plenty of games get excellent reviews despite having their embargoes lift right at launch, and I’ve even seen a couple of games tank with early reviews (not as frequent, admittedly).</p>
      <p>Whatever the reason, that’s when we’ll know what people think of the game. And early impressions have been positive for a long time now: the game is a third-person adventure sort, with combat, platforming, puzzles, and a dose of Metroidvania. It’s set in-between the original and prequel trilogies, telling the story of a young Jedi forced into hiding after the infamous Order 66.</p>
      <p>I’m certainly hopeful:<i> Jedi: Fallen</i> <i>Order</i> comes to us from Respawn Games, which has gained a recent wave of notoriety from <i>Apex Legends</i>. But it’s <i>Titanfall 2</i> that I’m really interested in here, which has one of the tightest, most exhilarating single-player campaigns of the generation. The studio might be more famous for its work with multiplayer, but it only takes about 8 hours with <i>Titanfall 2</i> to see what it’s capable with in a story-driven setting.</p>
      <p>So we’ll see what happens. It’s been a long time since we had a bonafide Jedi game, and the industry has changed a whole lot since <i>The Force Unleashed</i>. I don’t have an early copy, so I’ll be there with the rest of you.</p>
