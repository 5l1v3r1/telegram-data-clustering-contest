      <p>Hard seltzers have been tearing it up these days. They are portable, low-alcohol and appeal to millennials, the most elusive generation for spirits marketers. Massive shortages of <a href="https://www.whiteclaw.com/">White Claw </a>have been reported across the country, as new brands are eager to jump onto the market.One of the country’s biggest beer producers, <a href="https://www.budweiser.com/">Budweiser </a>of the Clydesdales’ fame, has even just launched its own, new brand. Currently, Bud Light Seltzer is available in<a href="https://www.eater.com/2019/11/7/20953335/bud-light-seltzer-hard-spiked-seltzer-anheuser-busch"> Black Cherry</a>, Strawberry, Lemon-Lime and Mango.</p>
      <p>So I sat down with the company’s vice president of marketing, Andy Goeler, to understand why a beer company wanted to get into the very crowded hard seltzer marketing fray.</p>
      <p>All responses have been edited for length and clarity.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Liza B. Zimmerman (LBZ): Why did a beer company decide to get in the seltzer game?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Andy Goeler (AG): Anheuser-Busch has been in the seltzer game for some time. Bud Light Seltzer complements our existing offerings of <a href="https://www.bonandvivspikedseltzer.com/">Bon &amp; Viv Spiked Seltzer</a> and <a href="https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/29/41821/">Natural Light Seltzer</a> by putting the power of our biggest brand behind this new product.</p>

      <p>Hard seltzer is bringing consumers back to the beer category. Expanding our hard seltzer portfolio with Bud Light Seltzer and the power of our distribution network will only help the category grow which is great for beer overall.</p>
      <p>
        <b>LBZ: How did you choose the flavors?</b>
      </p>
      <p>AG: We cannot disclose this, but we can assure you that our best-in-class brewing team has worked to create something that consumers will enjoy – whether you’re <a href="https://www.budlight.com/">Bud Light</a> drinker, a seltzer drinker or both. </p>
      <p>Our brewing team created the perfect hard seltzer for any occasion using a unique, five-step filtration process and the highest quality ingredients like sparkling water, real cane sugar and natural fruit flavor.</p>
      <p>
        <b>LBZ: Who is your consumer demographic?</b>
      </p>
      <p>AG: As the biggest brand in the industry we have a broad consumer base, but seltzer gives us the opportunity to expand it. If you like Bud Light, and even if you don’t, we think you’ll like this seltzer. </p>
      <p>
        <b>LBZ: Do you have concerns that the seltzers could cannibalize beer sales?</b>
      </p>
      <p>AG: Seltzer has brought excitement to the entire category and brought consumers back to beer from wine and spirits. We are looking forward to leveraging the power of the Bud Light brand to help grow the category.</p>
      <p>
        <b>LBZ: How are your seltzers different?</b>
      </p>
      <p>AG: Bud Light Seltzer holds the name of the biggest beer brand in America and will break through the category by leveraging the size and scale of Bud Light at launch. For those anytime, easy-drinking occasions, we’d put it up against any other seltzer out there. </p>

      <p>The five-step filtration process ensures a cleaner finish with no aftertaste. Our simple ingredients create a light and bubbly seltzer.</p>
      <p>
        <b>LBZ: Will the launch be national?</b>
      </p>
      <p>AG: Yes. Bud Light Seltzer is available wherever Bud Light is sold nationally. </p>
      <p>
        <b>LBZ: How much do you expect to sell in the first year?</b>
      </p>
      <p>AG: We cannot disclose this.</p>
      <p>
        <b>LBZ: It is basically a product for the off-premise?</b>
      </p>
      <p>AG: No.</p>
