      <h1>Shootings, blasts prompt Denmark to tighten border controls</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T00:00:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Jan M. Olsen</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/copenhagen/">COPENHAGEN</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/denmark/">Denmark</a> (AP) — <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/denmark/">Denmark</a> will temporarily reinstate border controls with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sweden/">Sweden</a> and step up police work along the border after a series of violent crimes and explosions around <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/copenhagen/">Copenhagen</a> that Danish authorities say were carried out by perpetrators from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sweden/">Sweden</a>.</p>
      <p>The checks, which start Tuesday for six months, will take place at the Oresund Bridge between <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/copenhagen/">Copenhagen</a> and the Swedish city of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/malmo/">Malmo</a> and also at ferry ports.</p>
      <p>Lene Frank of Denmark’s National Police said there will be both random and periodic checks of people crossing the border and officers will focus “particularly on cross-border crime involving explosives, weapons and drugs.”</p>
      <p>Since February, there have been 13 blasts in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/copenhagen/">Copenhagen</a>. Authorities believe an Aug. 6 explosion at the Danish Tax Agency “was committed by criminals that had crossed the border from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sweden/">Sweden</a>.” Two Swedish citizens are in custody.</p>
      <p>Denmark Justice Minister Nick Haekkerup has called a June 25 double murder - where two Swedish citizens were gunned down in suburban <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/copenhagen/">Copenhagen</a> - “a showdown between feuding gangs from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sweden/">Sweden</a>.”</p>

      <p>On Saturday, one 15-year-old boy was shot dead and another 15-year-old was critically wounded in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/malmo/">Malmo</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sweden/">Sweden</a>’s third-largest city, which lies just across the water from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/copenhagen/">Copenhagen</a>.</p>
      <p>The boys “were well-known to the police despite their young age,” senior police officer Stefan Sinteus told a news conference Monday. “It was a somber weekend.”</p>
      <p>The shooting took place just minutes after an explosion in another <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/malmo/">Malmo</a> district where a bomb set under a car detonated, destroying the vehicle and damaging other cars. Police said Monday that the blast could have been a diversion from the killing.</p>
      <p>No one has been arrested in the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/malmo/">Malmo</a> shootings.</p>

        <p>Police in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/malmo/">Malmo</a> - a Swedish city also hit by explosions and shootings between feuding gangs - will get extra officers to cope with the violence, said Carina Persson, the southern Sweden regional police chief.</p>
        <p>Haekkerup said last month that the blast at the headquarters of the Danish Tax Agency and the twin murders in suburban <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/copenhagen/">Copenhagen</a> were “examples of the serious crime that can flow over the border from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sweden/">Sweden</a>. We will not accept that.”</p>
        <p>He said the temporary border controls should protect <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/denmark/">Denmark</a> against both “foreigners who do not live up to the entrance criteria and foreigners who may intend to commit serious organizes crime or terror in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/denmark/">Denmark</a>.”</p>
        <p>Along with the border checks, authorities plan to have more CCTV surveillance, more surveillance of gang members, more drones and more bomb-sniffing dogs, Haekkerup said.</p>
