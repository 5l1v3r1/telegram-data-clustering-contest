      <h1>Apple Smart Glasses May Be Coming But With A Surprising Schedule</h1>

      <p>Apple really likes Augmented Reality (AR). CEO Tim Cook has repeatedly talked up the technology (see below for what he told me exclusively), and ARKit on the iPhone and iPad is growing apace. As have rumors of an AR headset from the company. Recent rumors have suggested that next year could be the time for Apple to release such a headset. But now, it’s claimed that the actual release could be literally years away. </p>

      <p>In a report in <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-eyes-2022-release-for-ar-headset-2023-for-glasses">The Information</a>, it’s said that an internal company meeting was held where a longer timeline was discussed.</p>
      <p>Previously, Ming-Chi Kuo, that super-reliable predictor of all things Apple, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/03/08/kuo-ar-headset-later-this-year/">has claimed</a> that manufacturing for an AR headset could start as early as now, or in the next eight months.</p>
      <p>As far back as 2017, Cook was evangelizing AR. In February that year, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/apple-tim-cook-boss-brexit-uk-theresa-may-number-10-interview-ustwo-a7574086.html">I interviewed Tim Cook in London</a>. He told me:</p>
      <blockquote>The smartphone is for everyone, we don't have to think the iPhone is about a certain demographic, or country or vertical market: it’s for everyone. I think AR is that big, it’s huge. I get excited because of the things that could be done that could improve a lot of lives. And be entertaining. I view AR like I view the silicon here in my iPhone, it’s not a product per se, it’s a core technology. But there are things to discover before that technology is good enough for the mainstream. I do think there can be a lot of things that really help people out in daily life, real-life things, that’s why I get so excited about it.</blockquote>
      <p>He was so fired up about it, you might have expected something to launch imminently.</p>
      <p>But today’s report says that we still have some time to wait. </p>
      <p>The report claims that last month in Cupertino there was an internal group presentation at Apple Park. There were up to 1,000 people at this internal briefing, almost exactly the number of seats in the Steve Jobs Theater, so perhaps that’s where it was held (the report is ambiguous). The meeting was led by Apple VP Mike Rockwell who said that the aim is to release an AR headset in, wait for it, 2022, and then follow up with AR glasses a year after, in 2023. </p>
      <p>Oh my, that’s a long time off. </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>But let’s remember that Google didn’t have success with its Google Glass gadget. Apple won’t want to get things wrong, for fear that its wearers, like Google’s, could be nicknamed Glassholes. </p>
      <p>Apparently, it’s also been said that Apple believes that in roughly a decade these AR glasses could replace smartphone. </p>
      <p>Okay, hold on. </p>
      <p>Whether that was said or not, I don’t believe that bit will pan out. </p>
      <p>When you think about the efforts spectacles wearers go to, to not wear them (Lasik! Contact lenses! Squinting!) I find the idea that we will voluntarily give up on pocketable devices for face-borne ones slightly preposterous. </p>
      <p>Leaving that aside, there were other interesting aspects of this claimed meeting. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Dark lenses</b>
      </p>
      <p>Apparently, the lenses will darken in AR mode, so others know why you’re not really listening to them any more. </p>
      <p>
        <b>App developers in 2021</b>
      </p>
      <p>Apple will reach out to developers a year or two before release so that there are plenty of apps at launch. </p>
      <p>So, is it true? </p>
      <p>I always thought 2020 was way too early – the level of leaks have been much too low, apart from anything else - even for a more peripheral gadget than the iPhone. </p>
      <p>Also, the data speeds necessary to make a decent fist of AR would surely need 5G connections, and no iPhone or iPad has a 5G capability yet. Next fall always seemed to me to be the earliest such a headset could feasibly appear. </p>
      <p>Even so, and despite the fact that there are no rival products of a mainstream kind which look likely to beat Apple to the punch, I’d have said Apple could easily get its headset and glasses together before that, say in 2021 at the latest. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-11/apple-s-ar-push-will-start-with-ipad-and-culminate-with-glasses">Mark Gurman at Bloomberg</a> seems to confirm this, saying he believes a headset could be released in 2021 or 2022. Gurman, a very reliable source, claims the change to push back release has only recently come about, and he says that next year, perhaps as soon as the first half of 2020, new sensors on the iPad Pro will let people create 3D reconstructions of rooms, objects and people.</p>
      <p>My other note of caution is that Apple is very cagey about timelines, even within the company. I’m not saying discussing these timelines is impossible in a big company meeting, but I’d just say I’m not quite convinced.</p>
