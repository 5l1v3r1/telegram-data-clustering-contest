      <p>At times I think that my experience in financial planning must have been rare since throughout my career I have worked for, with, and been mentored by minority and female advisors. These were very successful individuals that put in the work to achieve their role as a trusted advisor or manager.As CFP Board prepares for its second Diversity Summit on November 13 in our nation’s capital, I’m certain that there will be lots of discussion of the need for diversity, but little discussion of how to advance it from ‘outside the box’ or ‘outside the Beltway’ perspectives, to the real-world experiences that these co-workers I’ve known have lived by.</p>
      <p>Instead, in recent years, I have listened to experts that CFP Board and others in the financial community have put forward. Most often these younger individuals, not successful advisors, often self-proclaimed experts in diversity and intersectionality (and perhaps only in those topics), and a few only making their careers in diversity due to support from organizations like CFP Board and other groups. The push of the grievance politics of intersectionality, rather than constructive solutions to advance diversity, is always a core belief one must accept, and the solutions are always from the same Marxist, control-economy thinking that borne the intersectionality field itself.</p>
      <p>As I mentioned in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/feeonlyplanner/2019/09/17/why-cfp-board-failed-the-public-and-will-again/">prior criticism of CFP Board</a>, as it has decided to reach out beyond being a mark that the public relies on for financial planning expertise, it largely has chosen to promote progressive – and, as in the case of promoting intersectionality, extreme – politics and agendas, as opposed to staying apolitical, despite many polls showing a diverse split in political ideologies in financial and investment advisors. There is little to no diversity of thought in or advanced by CFP Board and other financial advisor associations, which likely is why there virtually no successful lobbying efforts advanced, despite the massive amount of spending and energy CFP Board and others devote to it.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Ideas promoted are one way – the progressive way – or no way.</i>
      </p>
      <p>In pursuing its political “Diversity and Inclusion” agenda (and, noticeably leaving out Equity, the third and most desired component from every serious intersectionalist’s agenda, which I do not believe will go unnoticed for long and could turn into negative feelings from those that decide the direction of intersectionality), CFP Board has chosen to once again involve itself in progressive politics rather than show a serious commitment to increase the demand for financial planners, help the profession expand to new clientele – in fact, as I note below they also recently repeated a threat to the one thing most advisors built businesses around – and thereby increase the need for advisors and diversity.</p>
      <p>The current trend to promote “diversity and inclusion” comes from a political movement known as intersectionality. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/27/opinion/im-glad-the-dyke-march-banned-jewish-stars.html?_r=0">Bari Weiss in 2017 confirmed intersectionality is political when she wrote in The New York Times,</a></p>
      <blockquote>“Intersectionality is the big idea of today’s progressive left. In theory, it’s the benign notion that every form of social oppression is linked to every other social oppression… in practice, intersectionality functions as kind of caste system, in which people are judged according to how much their particular caste has suffered throughout history. Victimhood, in the intersectional way of seeing the world, is akin to sainthood.”</blockquote>
      <p>Without going too deep into intersectionality, it comes from the university system, though it is criticized by intellectual opponents as not having the academic rigor of other topics of study. Many of its detractors in the university of late have been liberal professors who are being forced to acknowledge it in their classes at the expense of what they know has value to the students and their future careers. Michael Rectenwald, Peter Boghossian, Gad Saad, Jordan Peterson, and other current and past professors, some very liberal and even Marxist, have criticized the victimhood mentality of intersectionalists and their goal of tearing down in a zero-sum worldview. The theory is systems (and people) must be torn down to make ways for others who have been victims; people like my former colleagues and even those as successful as Chris Gardner, who Will Smith portrayed in the 2006 film <i>The Pursuit of Happyness</i>, are simply ignored.</p>
      <p>It should be obvious that intersectionality is against all that personal financial planning is about. We are an uplifting profession. We need to increase our value, knowledge, compassion, and merit in order for a client to choose to hire us. The intersectionalist view of the world is not compatible with personal finance and if advanced will cause the exact opposite result as clients fail to see the value in the advisor pushing victimhood, but CFP Board continues to pursue the politics of it in any case. We are a generous profession - volunteering our time and knowledge (at one point organizations like CFP Board contributed more to that with outreach to communities not as likely to engage the services of a planner).</p>
      <p>Through its publications, podcasts it sponsors and people it has promoted, CFP Board has clearly aligned itself with the politics of intersectionality as the way to promote diversity. At their last summit, a speaker spoke about the “racist laws, violence, and theft of community and individual wealth” (zero-sum game). The same speaker regularly writes using the words “white people” and has writing how white people should ask how minorities would like to be identified while seeing no irony in her own regular use of collective terms.</p>
      <p>I would like to propose instead of seeking diversity through promoting ideas of oppression and victimhood that are obsessed with race, gender, and sexual preference, financial service firms and certificants should ask CFP Board to make a serious effort to increase diversity without pushing divisive politics in the following ways:</p>
      <p>1)     <b><i>Remove the bachelor's degree requirement to becoming a CFP® professional.</i></b></p>
      <p>The education requirements to become a CFP® certificant are nowhere near as robust as becoming a CPA, and unlike becoming a CPA, outside of a handful of courses, credits and degrees can be in any field.</p>
      <p>As CFP Board introduced this requirement, educational programs began to expand in soft degrees, like Human Ecology or Education, as opposed to Business schools and more hard sciences.</p>
      <p>I received my bachelor’s in 2002 from The Ohio State University’s College of Education and Human Ecology in one of a handful of bachelor’s programs that met the CFP Board’s required education program. Today, the number of schools with an approved program has expanded substantially, though this has also increased along with intersectional feminist professors increasing in the university system (since there are so few jobs for them in the real world).  </p>
      <p>It is interesting that CFP Board acknowledges that education is a cost that keeps minorities from choosing financial planning as a profession, but any certificant would immediately notice how they have significantly minimized what that cost is.</p>
      <p>From a 2018 publication titled <a href="https://centerforfinancialplanning.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Racial-Diversity-in-Financial-Planning.pdf">Racial Diversity In Financial Planning</a> CFP Board states:</p>
      <blockquote>“For example, the cost of pursuing CFP® certification, including the cost of education and preparing for and sitting for the CFP® Certification Examination, can range from $6,000 - $10,000 which can present a significant financial barrier to becoming certified, particularly for those coming from traditionally disenfranchised communities.”</blockquote>
      <p>This statement is known by anyone familiar with CFP® certification to be false, or at least a fraction of the truth. CFP Board requires a bachelor’s degree in addition to the required courses to sit for certification, which drive the costs up substantially more than they admit.</p>
      <p>If one were to accept CFP Board’s cost estimate to take the few required courses to be $6,000 - $10,000, which would only be 20 hours of the current OSU approved bachelor’s degree program, then the cost to finish the degree at 120 hours would be $36-60,000 and only a small portionof the cost to qualify to sit for certification would be for related courses.</p>
      <p>There is simply no reason that CFP Board requires certificants to hold a degree – be it in accounting, Agriculture or Intersectionality – to become a financial planner.</p>
      <p>If CFP Board believes that $6-10,000 is “a significant financial barrier” then the artificial barrier they have erected to have a bachelor’s degree is far more serious and it must be removed immediately if they are at all serious about diversity. <i>To not is to not remove the most significant obstacle to diversity in our profession.</i></p>
      <p>2)     <b><i>Return focus to community outreach programs.</i></b></p>
      <p>Around the start of the decade CFP Board and other associations made moves away from past outreach and education events in local communities. I was a volunteer for many Financial Planning Association (FPA) and CFP Board outreach events in the city of Detroit, and in large part dropped by FPA membership after years of not seeing a single outreach opportunity.</p>
      <p>Over time the focus of these organizations moved away from doing the work of outreach to politics and lobbying. Just as CFP Board has adapted progressive politics, FPA as a partner organization has largely moved in lockstep with their own ‘diversity and inclusion’ program as well as progressive lobbying.</p>
      <p>3)     <b><i>Promote successful experts and a diversity of thought.</i></b></p>
      <p>CFP Board funds far too much in progressive intersectional messages with those they have hired and promoted, and ignored far more qualified minority advisors who are not progressive. These people should also be able to tell their stories.</p>
      <p>It is important for individuals to hear from a diverse group of true experts in our field, and not only diverse in race, gender, or sexual preference, but diversity of thoughts. Too often individuals that are promoted in many of CFP Board’s diversity movement have had no success in business, and most likely have been chosen for their politics and their appearance, rather than having much to share on how to find success in a financial planning career.</p>
      <p>I often recall one experience at a job interview as a new graduate for a job I did not get with a major brokerage firm. My interviewer was a young, minority woman. During the interview I made the comment that I was passionate about <u>learning</u> to do financial planning.</p>
      <p>The response from my interviewer was that we were in the business of <u>doing</u>, not learning. It was a realization that I needed to produce for people, and learning was what I did in my own time.</p>
      <p>When I listen to today’s young diversity advocates, including woke hosts of podcasts, tell prospective minority advisors that “their first job is to learn” rather than to do, that employers need to adjust their hiring rather than candidates improve their standing, and regularly discussing victimhood, I think back on by learning that lesson early allowed me to advance in the industry. Just like CFP Board’s insincerity to do the work to promote actual diversity, today’s diversity experts have little substance beyond the politics and little interest or ability in providing the lessons that are necessary to be a success.</p>
      <p>I expect that this suggestion will never be advanced since doing so would be against the politics of intersectionality and victimhood.</p>
      <p>4)     <b><i>End lobbying for rules that threaten financial planning and begin to promote it with new ideas, by ending the lack of diversity of thought at CFP Board.</i></b></p>
      <p>CFP Board and other organizations have done significant damage to financial planning by their lobbying. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/feeonlyplanner/2019/07/01/the-day-fiduciary-died/">As I’ve noted in the past</a>, advice advisors knew to be in a client’s interest for decades and still know to be true today is now being attacked by regulators and even CFP Board itself to the harm of both the client and financial planner.</p>
      <p>CFP Board recently released a cartoon video version of Case Studies of the new Code of Ethics and Standards of Conduct, and once again made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FS6PnfJPUzs">the very first issue they discuss that of the rollover</a> IRA (<i>see </i><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/feeonlyplanner/2019/07/19/the-many-reasons-to-rollover-a-401k-and-the-one-reason-not-to/#51ec498136ab"><i>The Many Reason To Rollover A 401(k) And The One Reason Not To</i></a>).</p>
      <p>With rules like this, CFP Board is doing nothing that will change a value proposition that an advisor presents or the value that a client will receive, but pretends that it can judge that value and the opportunity cost of an individual not hiring an advisor, while destroying the one event that built the majority of CFP® certificants careers – IRA rollovers. While I have reached out to CFP Board to discover the metrics they would use to measure value to a client (or how they will judge in the future a fact set of a past decision), I have yet to receive a response. Items like this that threaten an advisor for simply accepting a client who chose to hire them will not help expand minority advisors, and can only be implemented politically (which, should frighten all advisors and prospective advisors).</p>
      <p>In promoting undefined rules, CFP Board politicizes and degrades the value of the planner that previous studies show is far above the cost (as should be obvious from the simple fact financial planning is a job that exists), pretends it can judge that value to a client it does not know, ignores the economic reality that always and everywhere the client is the determiner of the value proposition in a contract, and destroys opportunities for future advisor growth as it adds an unnecessary and useless litigation risk to planners.</p>
      <p>But it is clearly very important to them despite the damage it will do to new entrants into the field and the push for minority advisors, because it is always the <b><i>very first</i></b> item on their agenda. Sadly, it’s also the #1 item on the agenda of every mutual fund firm, 401(k) firm, robo-advisor in competition with financial advisors because of the great benefits it gives them over independent financial planners.</p>
      <p>The biggest threat to diversity is not a lack of desire of employers or the public to hire a minority individual to be their financial planners, but it is in the politics and Marxist desire to control a profession, the intersectionalists desire to control outcomes that organizations like CFP Board advance, as well as the unnecessary costs and risks to that investment that will keep new advisors away from the field.</p>
      <p>While the <i>young, woke, and victim-culture</i> intersectional feminist advisor has no value to the next generation, the political aims of CFP Board have done significant damage for all prospective minority advisor in only promoting and surrounding itself with advisors of one political opinion, requiring tens and possibly a hundred thousand dollars to meet their valueless bachelor’s degree requirement, and continuing to press progressive and useless lobbying and rules that harm planners while ignoring that competitors will not face such rules (and not lobbying for them to).</p>
      <p>And, if we are a profession that values evidence, then these intersectionality-driven costs are only beginning in our field. This is only the second year of CFP Board’s diversity summit, but intersectionality has lived in the university system for decades.</p>
      <p>It is simply astonishing to observe that financial professionals are allowing organizations to begin to staff what Heather Mac Donald, Thomas W. Smith Fellow at the Manhattan Institute and author of <i>The Diversity Delusion</i>, points out as ‘the diversity bureaucracy’ in the university system. <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/university-spends-106-million-year-diversity-ashe-schow">The University of Michigan spends $10.6 million on salaries alone</a> for diversity bureaucrats. These people add nothing to the product of delivering education, yet students are forced to pay their salary and benefits – often some of the biggest in the universities – if they want a degree.</p>
      <p>However, whereas a university education is still seen as a requirement, a financial planner is a luxury, or at the very least optional in the eyes of most consumers.</p>
      <p>Progressive politicians have a tendency to not be concerned with the cost of their proposals; financial advisors can not be so ignorant. It is astonishing to think that in a world of fee-compression and technology replacing intellectual labor that an optional service-profession of financial planning wishes to join the universities and hospitals in forcing the price of their product or service up significantly, and pretend that this will result in a positive outcome to advance minority advisors demanded in planning. There will be no new jobs if these costs are felt at even a fraction of the university level, technology will replace labor and very quickly in options fields like financial planning.</p>
      <p>It is my hope financial advisors and those that value them will take the time to learn more about intersectionality, that it is about tearing down and not of lifting up, and that they seek alternative ideas that are not politicized. If not, it may not be that the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/feeonlyplanner/2018/07/22/the-future-for-fiduciary-financial-advisors">future fiduciary financial advisor may not only want to avoid being called a fiduciary</a>, but also will dump the title of CFP® professional financial advisor as well.</p>
