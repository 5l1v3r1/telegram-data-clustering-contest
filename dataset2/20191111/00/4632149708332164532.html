      <p><i>Day two of the Bangalore Literature Festival left little doubt about the city’s love for books and writers</i> <br/><br/>Nature can wreak havoc on the best laid plans. Author and historian, William Dalrymple couldn’t make it to Day Two of the Bangalore Literature Festival (BLF) because of Cyclone Bulbul. As he tweeted (with a peculiar reference to Bangladesh): ‘Cyclone BulBul has intervened and all flights have been cancelled in both East and West Bengal.’ <br/><br/>Warning bells were sounded out by Australian paleontologist Tim Flannery at his session ‘Can seaweed change the climate?’ He posited that seaweed, which grows 60 cm a day, can be used to de-acidify the oceans, saying that it was a “multi-potent” solution to the climate crisis. Seaweed farms could both, satisfy the needs of an ever-hungry planet in the future, while also sequestering for centuries, if not millennia. “In the future, it could be a significant part of the fight against climate change,” he said. <br/><br/>The day’s discussions were held on all aspects of storytelling, from illustrations to verses. Dramatised readings and performances and poems held the centre stage; with a reading of ‘Khooni Vaisakhi’ in Punjabi, a Jagriti Theatre presentation of Jane Austen: The Lass with a Delicate Air, and readings of verses by film producer Manish Mundra and spoken word poet Hussain Haidry. <br/><br/>The star appeal came from the ‘villain of Bollywood’ Gulshan Grover. After a five-minute video on himself, the star made a dramatic entry on the stage for the session ‘Bad Boy’ named after his autobiography with the same title. Talking to a full house, he recalled his younger days in the “outskirts of Delhi” where he lived a life of terrible poverty. It was when he was doing his MCom in Shri Ram College of Commerce, “where my batchmates were people like Arun Jaitley and Rajat Gupta” that the acting bug bit him. The rest is legendary and the actor claims he is the first Bollywood actor to make a transition to Hollywood in the days when “there was no Internet”. <br/><br/>Other sessions included one with poet Arundhati Subramaniam and award-wining author Jerry Pinto. At the session ‘Telling Stories, Erasing Them’, Pinto discussed his book ‘Em and the Big Hoom’, which is a moving account of the impact of a mother’s mental illness on her family. Talking about the stakes of telling a personal story, he said, “No book is worth hurting someone you love. The ‘earlier’ Jerry would have said ‘I don’t really care’ but now it really matters to me.” He had given his manuscript to his sister “who really matters to me” and after she read the book, the only thing she told him was “there are too many commas.”</p>

      <p>Discussing the story of the home-grown company Flipkart, journalist Mihir Dalal talked about his book ‘Big Billion Startup: The Untold Flipkart Story’. “In 2014, when Sachin Bansal had announced that he wanted to make Flipkart a billion-dollar company, he had not just said it. He had already made the plans.” According to Dalal, entrepreneurial enthusiasm isn’t alone enough. “What it (success) needs is people at the top to evolve in terms of people management. No matter who you are, mentors or advisers are needed.” <br/><br/><br/>The slush and muck after Saturday night’s downpour were no deterrent for the hordes that thronged the session, ‘Lessons in love and leadership from India’s sex workers’ with Ashok Alexander, founder-director of non-profit Antara Foundation and leading economist Vijayendra Rao. Alexander spoke, to much applause, about his foundation’s work in averting 6,00,000 HIV infections in India by working with sex workers. “The first time I saw this world, it was just scene after scene of absolute destitution. Women sold themselves for Rs 50, 15-year-olds were doing drugs,” he said. <br/><br/>‘Belonging and Unbelong-ing in North-east India’ featured Janhavi Barua, Paramjit Bakshi and Preeti Gill. Reflecting upon the worrying xenophobia that has percolated India’s consciousness, Bakshi said poignantly, “If we succumb to populist pressures, the idea of India is lost.” <br/><br/><br/>As the crowds continued to swell and the lawns of the venue became increasingly dotted with people thronging authors, BLF ended with a session by Lisa Ray who discussed her book ‘Close to the Bone’ with author Mahesh Rao and a concert by Bindu and Ambi Subramaniam and Mahesh Raghvan’s Thayir Saadam Project.</p>
