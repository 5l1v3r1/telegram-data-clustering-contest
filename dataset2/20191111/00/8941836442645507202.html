      <h1>Zidane making sure entire Madrid squad stays motivated</h1>

      <p>MADRID (AP) - It’s been difficult to understand some of Zinedine Zidane’s lineup decisions at Real Madrid recently.</p>
      <p>The player who scores a hat trick in one game sits out the next. The one who looks like a regular starter at one point suddenly is pushed to the sidelines for an extended period.</p>
      <p>It’s all part of a bigger plan by the coach, though, one to have the squad - the entire squad - motivated and fully committed for when the decisive moments of the season arrive.</p>
      <p>“I want everyone to show that they are ready,” Zidane said after the team’s 4-0 rout of Eibar in the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/la-liga/">Spanish league</a> on Saturday. “I have to manage the squad, and make sure that all the players feel they are an important part of this team. This is how I think we can achieve big things. With 12 or 13 players you can succeed for some time, but not over a longer period.”</p>
      <p>His rotations have come often and without much logic, at least to those looking from the outside.</p>

      <p>Against Eibar, Zidane decided not to use young forward Rodrygo, who was coming off a hat trick and an assist in the team’s 6-0 rout of Galatasaray in the Champions League three days earlier. He instead promoted the return of Lucas Vázquez, who had missed action recently despite being a preferred starter earlier in the season.</p>
      <p>Rodrygo had taken the spot of fellow Brazilian Vinícius Júnior, who had lost space after often playing in place of Gareth Bale in the beginning of the season.</p>
      <p>Zidane also made changes between goalkeepers Thibaut Courtois and Alphonse Areola, switched between left backs Marcelo and Ferland Mendy, and often rotated midfielders Federico Valverde, Toni Kroos and Luka Modric.</p>
      <p>Few players have been able to avoid Zidane’s changes, most notably the newly signed Eden Hazard and the red-hot Karim Benzema, the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/la-liga/">Spanish league</a>’s leading scorer with nine goals.</p>

        <p>“The important thing is that those who are getting to play have been playing well,” Zidane said. “I will count on all of them. It means a lot when they are motivated and responding positively when they get a chance to play.”</p>
        <p>Madrid shares the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/la-liga/">Spanish league</a> lead with Barcelona and is in good position to advance from the group stage of the Champions League.</p>
        <p>KUBO THRIVES</p>
        <p>It might not be long before Zidane has another talented player to manage in his squad - Japanese teenager Takefusa Kubo.</p>
        <p>The 18-year-old Kubo belongs to Madrid but is playing on loan with Mallorca, where he has impressed recently.</p>
        <p>The skillful midfielder scored his first <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/la-liga/">Spanish league</a> goal in the team’s 3-1 win over Villarreal on Sunday, hitting a firm left-footed shot from inside the area. He also had a role in the team’s other two goals.</p>
        <p>“I’m happy that we got the win and that it came with me scoring a goal,” Kubo said. “I didn’t get off to a good start in the match, lost some balls, but eventually things started going well.”</p>
        <p>VALENCIA’S INJURIES</p>
        <p>Valencia defeated Granada 2-0 for its third straight win on Saturday, but two key players left the game injured, adding to the team’s long injury list.</p>
        <p>Midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbia had to be replaced before halftime with a muscle injury and striker Rodrigo left the field shortly after the break with a back problem.</p>
        <p>Rodrigo was dropped from Spain’s national team because of the injury.</p>
        <p>Several other players have been out because of injuries, including Gonçalo Guedes, Carlos Soler, Denis Cheryshev and Mouctar Diakhaby.</p>
        <p>Valencia is ninth in the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/la-liga/">Spanish league</a> and is in contention for a spot in the knockout stages of the Champions League.</p>
        <p>SCORING BATTLE</p>
        <p>Only Villarreal striker Gerard Moreno failed to find the net among the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/la-liga/">Spanish league</a>’s top scorers this weekend.</p>
        <p>Karim Benzema scored twice for Real Madrid to remain the leading scorer with nine goals, but Lionel Messi moved closer after a hat trick in Barcelona’s 4-1 win over Celta Vigo on Saturday. The Argentina playmaker has eight goals.</p>
        <p>Moreno also has eight goals, as does Loren Morón, who netted Real Betis’ lone goal in the team’s 2-1 loss to rival Sevilla on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Lucas Pérez scored his seventh goal in seven matches in Alavés’ 3-0 victory over Valladolid on Saturday.</p>
