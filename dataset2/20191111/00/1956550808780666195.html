      <h3>Time Out Says</h3>
      <p>Let’s not Pretend otherwise, we’ve arrived at the recently opened <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/restaurants/414139-cml-camel-station-opens-in-the-dubai-mall">Camel Station</a> to try one thing only – camel. What we’re not expecting is a wonderfully chic-designed restaurant with beautifully wacky artistry, minimalist furnishings and an outdoor terrace we know is sure to be popular in winter.<br/><br/>Impressive, sure, but that same level of enthusiasm doesn’t last once we open the menu. For a spot that boasts the novelty of serving camel – an intriguing concept in tune with the Middle East – Camel Station doesn’t offer many options starring the ships of the desert.<br/><br/>In fact, we count around four <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/gallery/410668-50-best-dishes-in-dubai-of-2019">dishes</a>, with the rest being run-of-the-mill US grub. Burgers, pizzas, fries covered with cheese and sprinkled with beef bacon – if it’s comforting, Camel Station has it.<br/><br/>But it’s the camel we’re here for, and although underrepresented on the <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/restaurants">menu</a>, we’re impressed by the sizeable amounts we’re (speedily) given.<br/><br/>Although, what we soon discover is that there isn’t much meat on a camel.<br/><br/>With the venue’s signature burger, patties are thin and soft to bite into, while an almost overwhelming amount of melted cheese and sauce masks its taste.<br/><br/>Despite this, the venue still does a keen job of serving up tasty, upscale comfort grub.<br/><br/>As for its signature meat? We could have had more bite from a regular beef burger.<br/><br/><b>WHAT IS IT...</b><br/>Upscale novelty venue serving up all-star comfort grub favourites<br/><br/><b>WHY GO...</b><br/>If you’ve never had camel before or after a pit stop with top views of The Dubai Fountain</p>
