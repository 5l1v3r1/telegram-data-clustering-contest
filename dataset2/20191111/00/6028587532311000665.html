      <p>The Bay Area’s housing crisis will need time, resources, and a collective effort from the community, private enterprise, and lawmakers in order to make significant strides. A “silver bullet solution” is elusive in that there are a number of competing factors, including high prices for existing inventory, zoning issues requiring resolution for new construction, and limited land inventory for new construction -- all set against abundant well-paying jobs and a highly attractive quality of life continuing to attract people to the Bay Area. Even those working for one of the many great Bay Area companies are finding it difficult to save for a down payment in an environment of rapidly rising home prices and debt levels -- when pay has struggled to keep pace and frequently includes less-liquid equity compensation. As a result, many families are choosing to dramatically increase their commute -- and their buying power -- by moving North and East to where housing, raw land, and new construction are more plentiful.</p>
      <p>Because of the unique housing market and general openness to new ideas in the Bay Area, I think it’s important for people to consider alternative options for financing a new home purchase and maintaining financial flexibility. For example, San Francisco-based home co-investment company <a href="https://unison.com/?utm_campaign=bill-forbes&amp;utm_medium=dsp&amp;utm_source=quora">Unison</a> offers cash investments in owner-occupied homes to double or even quadruple a buyer’s down payment. For customers who have already purchased their home, they can free up equity for household needs like home improvements, funding education, or eliminating debt. Since these investments are made without the customer making monthly payments (they are paid based on sharing in the change in value of the home), Unison can significantly decrease the time needed to save for a down payment along with greatly reducing the overall portion of the family budget that is spent on housing. Solutions like home co-investing may not be for everyone, but are increasingly seen as a part of the solution to making home ownership more affordable.</p>
