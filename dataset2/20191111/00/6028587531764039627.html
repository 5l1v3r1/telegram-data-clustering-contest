      <p><b>Topline: </b>Famed investor and <i>Shark Tank</i> host Mark Cuban became the latest billionaire to criticize Elizabeth Warren’s proposed wealth tax in a <a href="https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/1193241536932261889">series of tweets</a> over the weekend, calling her the “smartest of all candidates” but also comparing her to President Donald Trump for “divert[ing] attention from reality” when it comes to her own wealth and funding Medicare For All.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cuban is the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/11/mark-cuban-says-sen-warrens-policies-divert-attention-from-reality.html">latest</a> big-name figure to enter the Warren-billionaires debate, saying he is “fine” with paying more taxes but that Warren’s wealth tax is designed to hide her own wealth from the public. </li>
        <li>At a net worth of $12 million, Warren is the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danalexander/2019/08/14/heres-the-net-worth-of-every-2020-presidential-candidate/#5d2c217237c5">fourth-richest</a> Democratic candidate in the 2020 field, behind Tom Steyer, John Delaney and Michael Bennet, according to <i>Forbes’ </i>estimates. </li>
        <li>Cuban said that qualifies her as being “filthy rich,” placing her within the richest 1% that she is targeting with her policy proposal.</li>
        <li>While Cuban declared her the “smartest” of the 2020 candidates, he also accused Warren of “intellectually misleading the public” on funding for her <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2019/11/01/heres-everything-we-know-about-elizabeth-warrens-205-trillion-medicare-for-all-plan/">Medicare For All</a> plan, drawing parallels with Trump’s tactics: “She is selling shiny objects to divert attention from reality.”</li>
        <li>Warren says her Medicare For All plan would cost <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2019/11/01/heres-everything-we-know-about-elizabeth-warrens-205-trillion-medicare-for-all-plan/">$20.5 trillion</a> over the next decade, while other policy experts put that closer to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/11/mark-cuban-says-sen-warrens-policies-divert-attention-from-reality.html">$32 trillion</a>. Cuban said getting the funding approved within four years for the ambitious plan would be “nearly impossible.”</li>
        <li>Under Warren’s <a href="https://elizabethwarren.com/calculator/ultra-millionaire-tax?source=soc-WB-ew-tw">new calculator</a>, which shows how much each billionaire would have to pay under her proposed wealth tax, Cuban would take a $205 million-per-year hit.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Big number:</b> Cuban, who owns the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks, has a net worth of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/mark-cuban/#24ca90276a04">$4.1 billion</a>, according to <i>Forbes</i>.</p>
      <p><b>Key background: </b>Cuban is just one of many billionaires to recently criticize Warren’s platform of taxing the ultrarich. He joins an ever growing list of names, including Microsoft cofounder <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2019/11/07/gates-becomes-latest-billionaire-to-grapple-with-warren/#6b769b763d02">Bill Gates</a>, hedge fund billionaire <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2019/11/05/billionaire-gop-donors-predict-stock-market-drop-if-these-democrats-win/#7ad664d54956">Paul Tudor Jones</a>, JPMorgan Chase CEO <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2019/11/05/jamie-dimon-enters-warren-billionaires-debate-she-uses-some-pretty-harsh-words/#6586a39867ea">Jamie Dimon</a> and investor Leon Cooperman—who was the first to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelsandler/2019/11/04/billionaire-leon-cooperman-escalates-feud-with-elizabeth-warren/#2b859a9d297a">publicly spar</a> with Warren on the topic. Several have even shared gloomy predictions of what a Warren presidency would mean for the stock market: Anywhere between a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2019/11/05/billionaire-gop-donors-predict-stock-market-drop-if-these-democrats-win/#7ad664d54956">10% to 25%</a> drop.</p>
      <p><b>Tangent: </b>Warren’s wealth tax isn’t only causing panic among billionaires. It’s also starting to alarm major Democratic donors—some finance executives have <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/26/wall-street-democratic-donors-may-back-trump-if-warren-is-nominated.html">warned</a> that they’ll sit out, or back Trump, if Warren clinches the nomination in 2020, according to CNBC.</p>
