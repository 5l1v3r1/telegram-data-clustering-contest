      <h1>Ilkay Gundogan opens up on Man City dressing room reaction to Liverpool defeat</h1>
      <h2>Midfielder said City team-mates felt they were 'disadvantaged' after watching replay of Trent Alexander-Arnold handball shout</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T00:52:39+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 00:52</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Manchester City midfielder Ilkay Gundogan has revealed how he and his teammates felt after the controversial handball incident in their defeat to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> .</p>
      <p>Premier League leaders Liverpool went nine points clear of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">City</a> with a 3-1 over their title rivals at Anfield on Sunday.</p>
      <p>But there was controversy over Fabinho's opener, with Trent Alexander-Arnold appearing to have handled the ball in the City penalty area in the build-up to the goal.</p>
      <p>Gundogan said the City players watched a replay of the incident in the dressing room immediately after the defeat.</p>
      <p>A VAR check found that the incident 'did not meet the considerations for a deliberate handball'.</p>

      <p>And <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/ilkay-gundogan">Gundogan</a> said he and his team-mates felt they had been hugely disadvantaged by the decision.</p>
      <p>"What do you want me to say right now? Obviously as a City player it feels like a disadvantage for us," said Gundogan in quotes reported by the <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/gundogan-liverpool-man-city-news-17234394?_ga=2.269035766.688801092.1573431309-1597771101.1553467823">Manchester Evening News</a> .</p>
      <p>“We saw the incident again in the dressing room afterwards and for me, obviously, it’s a penalty - but if you ask a Liverpool player they would say ‘You can give it but it’s maybe a 50-50 situation’.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think it’s easy to judge and I’m not here to make a statement on that, but there were a few situations where I thought maybe we could have had a decision for us. It didn’t happen and there’s nothing you can do.”</p>

      <p>That was a reference to two more penalty shouts, when Raheem Sterling appeared to be shoved over by Sadio Mane, and then another cross hit the arm of Alexander-Arnold.</p>
      <p>City also felt that Salah was offside when he headed in an Andy Robertson cross to make it 2-0.</p>
      <p>Liverpool had gone for the jugular after Fabinho's stunning strike broke the deadlock, and Gundogan felt that was the killer goal.</p>
      <p>"It was, also maybe because of the action just before the goal was scored," he said. "I felt like they were a bit positive in the seconds after the hand situation, and Fabinho scored a great goal.</p>

      <p>“It’s always tough when they score the first, especially at Anfield, and then go straight away for the second one, with the crowd and their emotions.</p>
      <p>“It takes a tough mentality to fight against that and unfortunately they scored the second straight after. It’s a defeat and we have to take it.”</p>
      <p>However, Gundogan refused to concede defeat in the title race, saying: "We have to accept it, but there is a long way to go. Last season in January we were quite far behind and able to turn it around.</p>
      <p>“But we are not independent any more – we have to see how our competitors do, especially Liverpool, and that makes the situation more uncomfortable.</p>
      <p>“We have to keep trying to play well and amass as many points as possible.</p>
      <p>“I don’t feel the title has already gone, and I don’t think the Liverpool players will feel like that, because we are all professionals.</p>
      <p>“We all try to do our best on the pitch but sometimes it doesn’t work out – we are human beings.”</p>
