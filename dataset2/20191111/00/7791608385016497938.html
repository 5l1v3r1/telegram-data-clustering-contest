He filmed himself sitting naked on one of the display toilets and pretended to use the shower display. Lee was then arrested last Thursday, and was charged for indecency and unlawful entry. <br/><b>In the clip</b> uploaded to his YouTube channel, Lee was seen entering IKEA as soon as it was about to close. He immediately made his way to the storeroom and hid between stacks of cardboard boxes. <br/><b>He stayed in the room</b> until 3am the next morning, and began exploring the store when he was sure everyone had left. <br/><b>In the footage,</b> Lee went up to the fourth floor, where the display bathrooms were located. He also rested on the beds and stood on the tables. In one part, he pretended to masturbate in front of a computer. <br/><a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <br/><b>At 9am,</b> the lights in the store switched on, so he made his way to the staff area, pretending to be the first customer in the outlet. However, one of the employees told him that the store wasn’t open yet. <br/><b>He then made</b> his way out of the store after being convinced that he had “successfully completed the mission.” <br/><b>After the video</b> was uploaded, many were quick to criticize Lee and reported him to the police. He apologized over his conduct, and his video has been taken off his social media channel.</p>
