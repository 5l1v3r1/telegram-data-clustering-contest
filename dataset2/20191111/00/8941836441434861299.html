      <p>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - An accomplished gymnast at Southern Connecticut State University has died following a serious spinal cord injury suffered in a training accident.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/melanie-coleman/">Melanie Coleman</a>, 20, of Milford, Connecticut, was training Friday at New Era Gymnastics in Hamden when she was injured, said her mother, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/susan-coleman/">Susan Coleman</a>.</p>
      <p>She was taken to Yale-New Haven Hospital and died Sunday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/melanie-coleman/">Coleman</a> was a former All State gymnast at Jonathan Law High School in Milford and was captain of the school’s gymnastics team. She was named a Women’s Collegiate Gymnastics Association Scholastic All-American this year.</p>
      <p>Her former club coach, Tom Alberti, said she attained a level 10, the highest level in the USA Junior Olympics Program.</p>

      <p>She was a junior studying nursing, following in the footsteps of her two older sisters, her mother said.</p>
      <p>“She’s from a very large, loving family; there’s seven of us, we were the Coleman seven,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/susan-coleman/">Susan Coleman</a> said. “We spent every day together for the past 20 years.”</p>
      <p>She volunteered at the gym where her accident occurred.</p>
      <p>Her coaches and professors described her as a special young woman who excelled in both the classroom and gym, college President Joe Berolino said in a written statement.</p>

        <p>“Our deepest sympathies are extended to her family and friends on this tragic loss,” he said.</p>
        <p>People the family has met by traveling to gymnastics events around the country are giving support that is “holding us up,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/melanie-coleman/">Coleman</a>’s mother said.</p>
        <p>She described her children, which also include two sons older than <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/melanie-coleman/">Melanie</a>, as “inseparable.”</p>
        <p>“We’re going to leave an empty space in our photos for her” from now on, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/susan-coleman/">Susan Coleman</a> said.</p>
