      <p>Sometimes a great meal is all about how it starts.  “Our pickle board features cucumbers, long island hot peppers, pomodoro (a Russian term for a brined tomato), marinated mushrooms (currently shimeji, also from Long Island), and pickled green strawberries. The first 4 pickles are quintessentially Russian. The board showcases a variety of pickling styles, while also representing our dedication to seasonality and local agriculture,” said Ricky Dolinsky, owner and chef of New Russian restaurant <a href="http://www.tzarevna.nyc/">Tzarevna</a>, located in New York City.  “Our house pickle board represents our restaurant's mission, which is to draw influence from the flavors of Russian cuisine while reinterpreting them through American optics and execution.”  </p>

      <p>At <a href="https://www.outlierseattle.com/">Outlier</a> in Seattle, Washington, pickle brine is frozen into a golf ball-shaped mold, and used as the ice cube for the cocktail of light beer, Old Crow and lemon juice. “The Bushwick is inspired by the Bushwick Country Club in Brooklyn, which invented the pickle back. My take on it starts with pickle brine frozen into a golf ball-shaped ice cube, and the drink itself is like a shandy-boilermaker hybrid, made with light beer, whiskey and lemon juice. The cocktail gets a nice salinity and kick from the brine as it melts,” said John Walter, drink creator and lead bartender. </p>

      <p>At <a href="https://mcgillins.com/">McGillin’s Olde Ale House</a>, Philadelphia’s oldest continuously operating tavern and one of the oldest in the country, the Printer’s Pickle Martini is named in honor of Ben Franklin, who loved pickles. It’s a dirty martini garnished with a petite pickle. “We created the Printer’s Pickle Martini back in 2006, on what would have been Ben’s 300th birthday. McGillin’s is only 159 years old, but if we’d been around in Ben Franklin’s day, we’re betting he would have thrown back a few here, just as politicians have been doing since 1860  — from Philadelphia mayors and governors to two presidential candidates — former vice president Joe Biden and Kamala Harris,” said Christopher Mullins, Jr., co-owner of McGillin’s with his parents, Mary Ellen and Chris Mullins, Sr.</p>

Taking inspiration from Asian flavors, the Pickleback at Kaido is a shot of Japanese Whisky served with chilled shiitake broth - the salty elements of the broth perfectly complement the whisky. </p>

      <p>At <a href="https://bombobar.com/">BomboBar </a>in Chicago, although the most common "pickle" is a "pickled cucumber," something to be pickled doesn't stop with the specific vegetable; anything can be pickled, it is just how something is preserved. Chef Fabio Viviani offers pickled chilies on his Egg White Avocado dish served at BomboBar in Chicago. Chef Viviani only includes three ingredients on his Egg White Avocado which he credits the pickled chilies to give it a flavor that will stand out amongst other dishes. "Three ingredients to a dish is not a lot, but when you pickle one of the ingredients it is like you are adding more with less," said executive chef Fabio Viviani. "I knew my Egg White Avocado needed a little more flavor which I figured, why not pickle a chili so I can add spice, salt and vinegar zest with just one ingredient when I pickle them?" </p>
