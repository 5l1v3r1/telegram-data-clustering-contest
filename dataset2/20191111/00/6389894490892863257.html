      <h1>Salaries for UK financial services workers jump amid competition for talent</h1>

      <p>The average salary for UK financial services workers jumped to £53,000 in the second quarter amid competition for talent.</p>
      <p>Data released today by recruitment software provider Broadbean showed the average salary for financial workers in the first quarter rose to £48,500 before climbing to £53,000 in the second quarter.</p>
      <p>The increase in salaries comes despite a fall in the number of roles advertised, with the number of roles available dropping from the second quarter of 2018 to the same period in 2019.</p>

      <p>The number of applications per vacancy for banking and finance jobs has gradually declined since the UK voted to leave the EU in 2016.</p>
      <p>Broadbean said Brexit is having an effect on industry confidence, with overseas talent less likely to move to the UK market and banks moving some operations to EU jurisdictions.</p>
      <p>A report last month from think tank New Financial found that more than 330 financial firms have relocated parts of their business ahead of the UK’s departure from the EU.</p>
      <p>“Potential applicants might be put off from applying for a job that might soon be moved abroad, or made redundant altogether,” Broadbean said.</p>
      <p>“But London will still remain a financial hub, and The City still needs to attract talent. One method to attract talent, is to increase the salaries for new vacancies,” it added.</p>

      <p>The rise in financial services salaries was mirrored by an increase in salaries across other sectors of the economy.</p>
      <p>Average salaries of roles advertised through Broadbean rose 12 per cent from the second quarter average of £38,000 to £42,500 for the same period in 2019.</p>
      <p>The company said this could be attributed to two factors: increases to minimum wage pushing up salaries of lower earners and worsening skills shortages at senior levels means businesses having to pay a premium to attract talent.</p>
      <p>“Now, perhaps more than ever before, the UK’s employment sector is a candidate’s market…Despite the uncertainty of our times and a nationwide fall in job applications, the UK’s job market has strength and pace,” the report said.</p>
