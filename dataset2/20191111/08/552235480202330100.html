      <h1>Jack Aitchison hailed as Celtic loanee nets for fourth game running</h1>
      <h2>The 19-year-old is impressing while on loan at Forest Green and his side sit top of the League Two table.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T08:25:37+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 08:25</time> by <a rel="author">Mark McDougall, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mark-mcdougall/</a></address>
      <p>Celtic youngster Jack Aitchison is continuing his fine form out on loan with Forest Green Rovers.</p>
      <p>And the Hoops loanee netted his fourth goal in four games during his side's <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/fa-cup">FA Cup</a> win over Billericay.</p>
      <p>He had gone six games without scoring since netting the winner on his debut against Cambridge but has hit a fine run of form in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>Starting with a goal against Mansfield, he also netted against Morecambe and Cheltenham to keep his side at the top of the English League Two table.</p>
      <p>And local website <a href="https://www.gloucestershirelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/forest-green-rovers-verdict-celtic-3523485">Gloucestershire Live</a> have been full of praise for the 19-year-old, admitting that the club would love to sign him on a permanent basis but insist he's destined for a higher level.</p>

      <p>They said: "The on-loan <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> star is really shining since moving to Nailsworth in the summer and on Saturday, he scored his fourth goal in four games.</p>
      <p>"He has scored important League Two goals against Mansfield Town, Morecambe and Cheltenham Town, and perhaps a less important one against Billericay, but it’s still crucial for his momentum to continue.</p>
      <p>"The Scottish attacker is a clinical finisher; rarely missing any opportunities he gets and at the weekend demonstrated that once again.</p>
      <p>"The 19-year-old has scored five goals for Rovers in all competitions now, including the four in as many games, and he will undoubtedly make it at a strong level in the future.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately for Forest Green, this means it is virtually impossible for the Nailsworth-based club to sign him on a permanent deal.</p>
      <p>"However, Aitchison’s form, if continued, with his incredible talent, can definitely help Rovers in their bid for promotion to League One."</p>
      <p>Aitchison is Celtic's youngest ever player and goalscorer after he netted on his debut in a 7-1 win over <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/motherwell-fc">Motherwell.</a></p>
      <p>He came off the bench in what was <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ronny-deila">Ronny Deila's</a> final match in charge and scored with his first touch.</p>
