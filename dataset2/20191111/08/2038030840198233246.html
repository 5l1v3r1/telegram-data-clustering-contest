      <p>Paris - French police arrested British rocker Pete Doherty after a drunken brawl in Paris on Sunday, a day after they released him following cocaine bust, prosecutors and his lawyer said.</p>
      <p>Doherty, 40, the front man of the Libertines, was arrested for assaulting a man while drunk, said the Paris prosecutors' office</p>
      <p>His lawyer Arash Derambarsh said Doherty was arrested after a fight with another man who was also drunk, who had filed a complaint for assault against him.</p>
      <p>After being released on Saturday from custody following an arrest for possession of cocaine, Doherty "went home then went out again to have a drink", the lawyer added.</p>
      <p>But because of the detox treatment he has been following for a month he cannot hold his drink, said Derambarsh.</p>
      <p>Doherty was first arrested in the early hours of Friday morning when Paris police caught him just after he had bought cocaine.</p>
      <p>The singer opted for a simplified procedure for people caught using drugs, agreeing to pay daily 50-euro fines for 100 days, failing which he will be jailed, the Paris prosecutors' office said.</p>
      <p>A judge still has to sign off on that deal, however.</p>
      <p>Derambarsh said on Saturday that his client, who is at the start of a major tour, had agreed to undergo full-time a medical treatment for his addiction to avoid a relapse.</p>
      <p>The bad boy of British rock - as famous for having dated supermodel Kate Moss as for his music - has repeatedly made headlines for drugs offences.</p>
      <p>In 2012, he was thrown out of a luxury rehab clinic in Thailand after claims he was a bad influence on other patients and did not try hard enough to kick his heroin habit.</p>
