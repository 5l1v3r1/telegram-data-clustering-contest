      <h1>Shopper outrage as Sainsbury’s bans kids from having chips with meals in cafes</h1>
      <h2>Shoppers have expressed their shock after finding out Sainsbury's has pulled chips from all its kids' meals, despite still happily selling them to adults</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T08:06:15+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 08:06</time> by <a rel="author">James Andrews, http://www.facebook.com/jameswritesmoney/</a></address>
      <p>Supermarket giant Sainsbury's has removed chips from all its children's meals - replacing them with 'healthier' alternatives.</p>
      <p>That means you little ones now have to choose between mashed potatoes, baked potatoes or sweet potato fries to accompany their fish fingers, sausages and chicken nuggets.</p>
      <p>Chips are still available as a side for adults but are no longer part of the chain's £2.75 kids' meals.</p>
      <p>And shoppers are unimpressed.</p>
      <p>“My boy loves chips but wasn’t allowed them with his fish fingers. It’s a farce because chips are on the adults’ menu. When I pointed this out I was told kids can’t eat chips at Sainsbury’s," a shopper in Halifax, West Yorkshire <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10319406/sainsburys-chips-kids-ban-cafe/">told The Sun</a> .</p>
      <p>“They are such killjoys. Who are they to tell me what I can or can’t feed my kids?"</p>

      <p>A parent at a Sainsbury's cafe in London added: “Chips are loved by children and should be a treat when eating out. It’s crazy the store is dictating diet.”</p>
      <p>Sainsbury's Cafe children meals cost between £1.30 and £3, and still include less healthy options including pizza and mac &amp; cheese along - just not chips. </p>
      <p>An adult side of chips form the Sainsbury's Cafe costs £1.40 - with less fat, sugar, salt and calories per portion than their sweet potato versions and costing 30p less.</p>
      <p>Sainsbury's told The Sun it hasn't had chips on its children’s menus "for 18 months".</p>
