      <h2>Arsenal striker Aubameyang has been appointed the club's most recent captain after Granit Xhaka's fall-out with fans - but it hasn't gone down well with all at the Emirates</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T08:21:02+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 08:21</time> by <a rel="author">James Whaling, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/james-whaling/</a></address>
      <p>Unai Emery seemingly has yet another problem on his hands at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> after reports emerged that new skipper Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's relationship with YouTube channel AFTV is causing dismay at the Emirates.</p>
      <p>Emery turned to star striker Aubameyang to take the armband after Granit Xhaka's tantrum against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> led to the Swiss midfielder being stripped of the captaincy.</p>
      <p>Xhaka swore at Arsenal fans as he was jeered during his substitution and has since failed to play for the club with his future at the Emirates looking bleak.</p>
      <p>Although Aubameyang is a generally poplar figure at Arsenal, his appointment as skipper has caused an element of concern, report <a href="https://theathletic.com/1361874/2019/11/11/ornstein-on-monday-doubts-over-aubameyang-captaincy-new-keeper-for-west-ham-and-fall-of-a-giant-poppy/">The Athletic.</a></p>

      <p>And that is down to his rapport with AFTV, which is said to have 'irritated' some figures at the club.</p>
      <p>Some at Arsenal apparently believe the upsurge in popularity of AFTV, formerly known as ArsenalFanTV, has contributed to the negativity towards the team.</p>
      <p>Aubameyang has appeared to 'like' a number of posts from AFTV on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> , including one from June which criticised Emery and another in September which encouraged the sale of Xhaka.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old has also reportedly been urged to stop engaging with 'Troopz' - one of AFTV's most notorious contributors - after Aubameyang seemingly invited him to games at the Emirates in his executive box.</p>
      <p>It is a situation Emery scarcely needs and one he must try and swiftly resolve given Aubameyang's importance to him - and the club - on the pitch.</p>
      <p>The Gabonese international has plundered 50 goals in 78 appearances since arriving from Borussia Dortmund and is their top scorer this campaign with eight strikes in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>His contract runs out at the end of next season and - while Arsenal are keen to extend - Aubameyang is understood to prefer to see if the Gunners qualify for next season's Champions League.</p>
      <p>Arsenal are already eight points off the top-four pace after they were well beaten by second-placed <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> in a 2-0 defeat the King Power Stadium on Saturday.</p>
