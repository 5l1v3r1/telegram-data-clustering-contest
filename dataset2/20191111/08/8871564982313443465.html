      <h1>[UPDATED] Panelo says Duterte to take three-day leave, immediately does about-face</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T08:13:36+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 08:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Manila" target="_blank">Coconuts Manila</a></address>
      <p>Presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo announced today that President Rodrigo Duterte would go on a three-day leave, only to reverse the statement within the span of just a few hours.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Read: <a href="https://coconuts.co/manila/news/duterte-back-pain-just-muscle-spasm-says-former-assistant-senator-go/">Duterte back pain just ‘muscle spasm,’ says former assistant Senator Go</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>In initially announcing the brief leave during a press conference today, Panelo, perhaps not surprisingly, had <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PresSpokespersonPH/videos/439648746733726/?permPage=1">told reporters</a> that there were no serious reasons behind the president’s short vacay, adding that it didn’t even count as official leave. Duterte just needed to rest, the loyal spokesman added.</p>
      <p>“As I’ve told the president, ‘Every time you have eight hours of sleep, your appearance improves,'” Panelo said. “I feel that is what he lacks. He always lacks sleep.”</p>
      <p>Panelo also referred to the case of tycoon Lucio “Bong” Tan Jr., who died this morning due to a brain herniation (a condition wherein the brain’s tissue shifts due to a stroke or injury). An avid sportsman, Tan died after collapsing during a basketball game.</p>
      <p>Noted non-doctor Panelo went on to assert that the businessman died of fatigue, while offering nothing in the way of proof to back up his conclusion.</p>
      <p>“That’s what also happened to Bong [Tan]. Lack of sleep, too much work, overworked. Tired. Even while lacking too much sleep he had to play basketball,” Panelo said, elaborating on his highly unscientific armchair diagnosis.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Despite the president’s recent <a href="https://coconuts.co/manila/news/duterte-ok-after-falling-off-motorbike-at-malacanang-palace/">motorbike accident</a> and much-publicized <a href="https://coconuts.co/manila/news/philippines-duterte-reveals-new-health-problem/">health issues</a>, Panelo insisted that Duterte was not going on sick leave and that the president just needed to ease up on work.</p>
      <p>He added that Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea would be in charge while the president is gone, and not Vice President Leni Robredo, whom he mockingly said was “very busy being anti-drug crime czar.”</p>
      <p>A few hours after making the declaration, however, Panelo did a complete 180, saying that the president wouldn’t in fact be taking any time off, and would instead <a href="https://twitter.com/PhilstarNews/status/1193828094815035392">be working from his house</a> in Davao City, the <i>Philippine Star </i>reported.</p>
      <p>Panelo didn’t explain the rationale behind the reversal.</p>
      <p>Duterte has been known to skip events and occasionally <a href="https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/inside-track/230860-duterte-prolonged-absences-skipped-events">vanish from the public eye</a> unannounced. In February, after he pulled one such stunt, he reappeared in a video on social media holding the day’s newspaper to <a href="https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1081080/im-alive-duterte-disproves-circulating-online">dispel rumors he had passed away.</a></p>
