      <p>Flamengo recovered from a goal down to beat Bahia 3-1 on Sunday and take another step towards what looks like an increasingly inevitable Brazilian league title.</p>
      <p>RIO DE JANEIRO: Flamengo recovered from a goal down to beat Bahia 3-1 on Sunday and take another step towards what looks like an increasingly inevitable Brazilian league title.</p>
      <p>Bahia were the last side to beat Flamengo - on the first weekend of the season in August - and they took the lead six minutes before halftime when Elberâ€™s cross deflected off Willian Arao and into the net for an own goal.</p>

      <p>However, second-half goals from Reinier, Bruno Henrique and Gabriel Barbosa, his 21st of the league season, guaranteed Flamengo an 11th win from their last 12 games.</p>
      <p>The victory increases their lead at the top to 10 points over second-placed Palmeiras, who dropped further behind when they could only draw at home to Corinthians on Saturday.</p>
      <p>There are six games of the season remaining.</p>
