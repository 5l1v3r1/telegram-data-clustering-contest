        <b>Little is known about Michael Schumacher's condition and his former-manager has admitted he would like the chance to know what progress the Formula 1 legend has made.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Willi Weber was Schumacher's manager during the German's early days in racing as he discovered and promoted both Michael and his brother Ralf. Weber also became well known for his shrewd business style and makingÂ merchandising deals for his clients.</p>
      <p>However, Weber has revealed that he knows very little about his former client's condition but he still believes in Schumacher making a recovery.</p>
      <p><i>"I know that Michael was hurt badly, but unfortunately not what progress he made since then,"</i> Weber told Kolner Express</p>
      <p>
        <i>"I'd like to know how he's doing and shake his hand or stroke his face. But unfortunately, that is rejected by Corinna.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"She probably fears that I will immediately recognise what is going on and tell the truth to the public.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"Still, I firmly believe in Michael's recovery because I know he is a fighter. If there is a chance, he will use it. This cannot be the end.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"I pray for him and am convinced that he will see him again."</i>
