      <h1>Listen to the creator of Undertale's new Pokemon Sword and Shield song right here</h1>
      <h2>Born out of a Twitter friendship</h2>

      <p>Just last week <i>Undertale</i> creator Toby Fox revealed that he was given the opportunity to contribute a song for <i>Pokemon Sword </i>&amp; <i>Shield</i>'s soundtrack, but it was left ambiguous as to what that would entail. Now, thanks to a new post <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/a-special-letter-and-song-from-undertale-game-creator-toby-fox/">on the official Pokemon website</a>, we know exactly what that song is: so we don't have to hunt for it on launch day.</p>
      <p>Fox notes that "a lot of people from Game Freak" ended up becoming <i>Undertale</i> fans, and "out of the blue" he decided to message Go Ichinose-san, a <i>Pokemon</i> composer, on Twitter. That correspondence led to a friendship, which in turn led him to a meetup with other Game Freak members over sukiyaki. The rest, as they say, is history, as Fox asked for the chance to contribute to <i>Sword </i>&amp; <i>Shield</i>, and told him "yes" over that very meal.</p>
      <p>There is a caveat! Fox says "It's the only song [he] made, and you can't hear it until you beat the game," which likely means that it's either a postgame or credits song. The snippet we get is over a minute long, enough to get the gist of the tune. You can listen to it below!</p>
      <p>This is a monumental achievement for Fox. Not only did he get to contribute a piece, but he's also immortalized on Pokemon.com with his own personal letter to fans: not many game developers can boast that. Amid all of the controversy surrounding <i>Sword</i> &amp; <i>Shield</i>, this is a nice little heartwarming story leading into its launch.</p>
