      <h1>Fabio Capello slams Cristiano Ronaldo after display in Juventus' win over AC Milan</h1>
      <h2>Ronaldo, 34, was withdrawn early in the second half after a below-par performance against AC Milan and replaced by Paulo Dybala</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T08:19:28+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 08:19</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Fabio Capello believes Cristiano Ronaldo isn't the world-beating player he once was - and has slammed the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> star for his reaction to being substituted over the weekend.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo, 34, was withdrawn early in the second half after a below-par performance against AC Milan on Sunday and replaced by Paulo Dybala.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese stormed past boss Maurizio Sarri and straight down the tunnel after he was withdrawn for a second game in a row.</p>
      <p>Substitute Dybala ultimately fired a second-half winner as Juventus returned to the top of Serie A after a 1-0 home win against AC Milan.</p>
      <p>And Capello, a former manager and player at the Turin giants, says Ronaldo must accept that manager Sarri has other attacking threats at his disposal.</p>

      <p>"I didn't like this, it wasn't nice," Capello told <a href="https://sport.sky.it/calcio/serie-a/2019/11/10/juventus-milan-sarri-intervista"><i>Sky Sport Italia</i> </a>. "He must be a champion even when he comes off the pitch.</p>
      <p>"The truth is that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/cristiano-ronaldo">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> hasn't dribbled [past] an opponent for three years. I did the <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-gb/primera-divisi%C3%B3n/34pl8szyvrbwcmfkuocjm3r6t">La Liga</a> commentary when he usually took the double step and left you there.</p>
      <p>"Inside him is a super-champion, the best of all, but now there is Dybala and Douglas Costa, who made two sensational goals. Dybala in excellent condition can make the difference, as can Douglas Costa.</p>

      <p>"They win games without Ronaldo. Juve seemed dependent on him, instead the great squad and the quality of the players helps them win anyway.</p>
      <p>"Bravo Sarri, who had the courage to take him off, it takes personality, especially thinking that all the players in the squad can play and make a difference.</p>
      <p>"Cristiano did it for a while, but now it's not him and he must recover - especially on a physical level. He does not have the speed and dynamism he has shown at other times."</p>

      <p>Juve were knocked off their perch by Inter Milan on Saturday after they fought back to beat Verona 2-1, but Dybala's solitary strike in a hard-fought victory was enough to lift them back to the summit.</p>
      <p>The Argentina international had replaced Cristiano Ronaldo in the 56th minute and he drilled home the decider 13 minutes from time after a slick Juve move on the edge of the Milan box</p>
      <p>Sarri's side extended their unbeaten start to the season to 16 matches in all competitions, while Milan have lost six of their last nine league games.</p>
