      <p><b>Wolf Parade</b> recently released the new song <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/wolf-parade-release-new-song-against-the-day-lp5-coming-soon/">“Against the Day”</a> off their heavily-teased, John Goodmanson-produced fifth album, and today they shared a second single and officially announced the album. It’s called <i>Thin Mind</i>, and it’s due January 24 via Sub Pop. It’s the band’s second since ending hiatus (following 2017’s <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/review-wolf-parade-are-back-and-great-as-ever-on-cry-cry-cry/"><i>Cry Cry Cry</i></a>), and first since they became a trio, following the <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/wolf-parade-part-ways-with-dante-decaro-will-continue-as-a-three-piece/">departure of Dante DeCaro</a>.</p>
      <p>“Against the Day” was a very collaborative sounding song where Spencer Krug and Dan Boeckner traded vocals, but new song “Forest Green” is a classic-Boeckner-style synth-punk ripper, and both are good stuff. Listen to the new song and check out the tracklist below. That’s the album artwork above.</p>
      <p>Wolf Parade also have upcoming Europe/UK dates in 2020, which are listed below. Stay tuned for North American tour dates.</p>
