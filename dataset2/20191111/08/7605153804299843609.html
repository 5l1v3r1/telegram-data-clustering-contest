        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 11 – World marathon record holder Eliud Kipchoge has made it into the five-man shortlist for the 2019 IAAF Male Athlete of the Year award alongside Uganda’s 10,000m world champion Joshua Cheptegei.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kipchoge had been in the initial list alongside world 15000m champion Timothy Cheruiyot who has unfortunately not mad it to the penultimate shortlist.</p>
      <p>He will look to win the IAAF top award for a second consecutive time alongside Cheptegei, USA’s pole vaulter Sam Kendricks, American sprinter Noah Lyles and Norwegian 400m hurdler Karsten Warholm.</p>
      <p>Kipchoge set the world record in Berlin last year, leading to his award at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>This year, he has only participated in two races, the London Marathon which he successfully clinched as well as the historic Ineos 159 challenge in Austria where he became the first man to run a marathon under two hours.</p>
      <p>A three-way vote decided the final shortlist of five, whittled down from the initial 11.</p>
      <p>The World Athletics Council and the World Athletics Family cast their votes by email, while fans voted online via our social media platforms. The Council’s vote counted for 50% of the result, while the Athletics Family’s votes and the public votes each counted for 25% of the final result.</p>
      <p>The male and female World Athletes of the Year will be announced at the World Athletics Awards 2019 to be staged in Monaco on November 23.</p>
