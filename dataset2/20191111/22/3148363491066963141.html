      <h1>New Hampshire Grandmother Sending 100K Holiday Cards to U.S. Soldiers</h1>
      <h2>Laura Landerman-Garber has transformed a family tradition into a project that will ship 100,000 cards this holiday season.</h2>

      <p>Landerman-Garber, a Hollis, New Hampshire, clinical psychologist, calls the Holiday Cards for Our Military Challenge (HCOMC) a “passion project.” The goal is simple: to bless homesick soldiers overseas with a bit of the season’s cheer.</p>
      <p>“The thought of someone being away at a time when in our culture, in American culture particularly, the holidays are all about gathering together. … For me, I wanted to be able to reach out and just maybe give a little bit of a bridge so that person who is far away feels a little tiny bit closer to home,” she <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/11/us/new-hampshire-grandmother-holiday-cards-troops-trnd/index.html">told</a> CNN.</p>
      <p>And while the HCOMC has expanded its reach to six digits, it began much smaller. Sixteen years ago, Landerman-Garber held Thanksgiving turkey for ransom: No family member could partake of the festivities until they had redeemed their “ticket to turkey” by writing cards to members of the U.S. armed forces overseas.</p>
      <p>When her own daughter was deployed to the Navy’s USS <i>Theodore Roosevelt</i>, Landerman-Garber upped the ante — every soldier on the ship would received a card. To reach the 17,000 cards that made their way aboard, she enlisted the aid of churches, synagogues, Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts, and politicians.</p>
      <p>In 2018, the military’s unofficial grandmother pledged 5,000 cards to each branch of the military. It was not difficult; participants ended up helping to send over 50,000 cards last December. This year’s goal was 50,000, but they have far surpassed that with 100,000 cards ready to ship.</p>
      <p>Landerman-Garber retains the faith in humanity that sparked her project: “In spite of all of the divisiveness in the country right now, in spite of all the infighting and between fighting — I know this sounds like a Hallmark card — I really do believe they have in their hearts to do the right things, to be kind,” she said.</p>
