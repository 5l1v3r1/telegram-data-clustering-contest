      <p>Famous playboy and Instagram celebrity Dan Bilzerian has, perhaps jokingly, announced his intent to run for president in the 2024 election in the United States, TMZ reports.</p>
      <p>During a chat with the media outlet in Las Vegas where he was asked about his thought of Kanye West’s presidential ambitions, Bilzerian remarked that the rap star is “better than Hillary [Clinton]” before chuckling and adding that Ye might actually end up running against him in 2024.</p>

      <p>He added that he’d have enough time to get his “sh*t done” by 2024, noting, however, that Kanye seems more likely to get Donald Trump’s endorsement.</p>
      <p>As news of this development hit social media, many netizens did not seem particularly thrilled with such prospects for the 2024 election.</p>

      <p>Some made their own mocking suggestions about who should run for president.</p>

      <p>In June 2015, Bilzerian also announced his bid to run to be President of the United States, though he dropped out of the race in December.</p>
