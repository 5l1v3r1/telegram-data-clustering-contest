      <p>Among the many new characters in Disney+'s <a href="https://www.bostonherald.com/2019/11/10/gina-carano-joins-star-wars-in-mandalorian/"><i>The Mandalorian </i>is Cara Dune (Gina Carano)</a>, who serves as a pivotal part of the story despite the fact that she's never appeared in the <i>Star Wars </i>franchise. Details about the new series have been somewhat scarce, but <a href="https://ew.com/tv/2019/08/25/the-mandalorian-character-details/">Cara has been described</a> by <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> as a former Shock Trooper turned mercenary who "fought in the Galactic Civil War under the banner of the Rebellion." According to Carano, however, Cara feels a little lost now that the Empire has fallen and the war is over.</p>
      <p>"She just really loves the adrenaline of the war, so when that all dies down, she's kind of stuck," <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/gina-carano-hints-at-cara-dunes-dynamic-with-the-mandalorian/">the actress told </a><i>Us Weekly</i> earlier this month. "All the excitement's gone, so she goes out from the outer realm. She does little hustling jobs for money, and she's a loner. She keeps to herself, she doesn't really trust anyone."</p>
      <p>Sticking to herself, though, won't last long once she comes face to face with the show's titular Mandalorian, a bounty hunter played by Pedro Pascal. Carano didn't say much about how the two encounter one another, but teased to <i>Us Weekly</i> that it's a "really great first meeting," and that she thinks "people will truly enjoy their dynamic."</p>
      <p>Speaking to <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>, she was slightly more forthcoming. "<a href="https://ew.com/tv/2019/09/04/pedro-pascal-gina-carano-mandalorian-photo/">[Cara] runs into the Mandalorian </a>on one of these planets that she's hiding out on and thinks that he's there to take her in and then their relationship escalates from there," Carano explained.</p>

      <p>But while Carano has been pretty tight-lipped about her character, she's had more than enough to say about her co-star. "[Pascal is] just an absolute favorite," she told <i>Us Weekly</i>. "He really stands out in this quiet confidence that he has onscreen, and when you meet him offscreen, he is so goofy and so fun and has the heart of a child. He's an incredible actor.”</p>
      <p>Whether Cara and the Mandalorian wind up as friends or foes remains unclear, but given <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7Ta1PDod_E">Carano's background in mixed martial arts</a>, she's definitely someone you won't want to mess with, regardless of which galaxy (or which side) you come from.</p>
