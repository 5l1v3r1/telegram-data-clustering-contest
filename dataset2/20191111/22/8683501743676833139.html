      <p>While the Marvel Cinematic Universe has proven itself as an unstoppable machine throughout Phase Three, Warner Bros.' DC live-action universe has also been making some great strides forward. Following the poor performance of <i>Justice League</i>, the DCEU pivoted away from crossovers, allowing directors to have more control in projects like <i>Shazam!</i> and <i>Aquaman</i>. One of the most hotly anticipated movies coming down the pipeline in James Gunn's <i>The Suicide Squad</i>, which will bring back some returning villains alongside newcomer characters. And now Gunn is throwing some major compliments Margot Robbie's way.</p>
      <p>Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn was the undisputed scene stealer from <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482693/suicide-squad-director-clears-up-inaccurate-jared-leto-rumor">David Ayer's <i>Suicide Squad</i></a>, and she'll soon return to theaters in <i>Birds of Prey</i>. James Gunn's upcoming DC debut will be the whopping third time Robbie is playing Harley, and the efforts have definitely impressed Gunn. Because when recently asked if he'd started working with Robbie, he said:</p>
      <blockquote>Yes. She might be the best actor I've ever worked with.</blockquote>
      <p>Woah. James Gunn has had a long career in filmmaking, and has worked with plenty of talented actors during his time behind the camera. Margot Robbie must be doing some stellar work in <i>The Suicide Squad</i> to eclipse the rest of Gunn's collaborators. And that'll make anticipation for the upcoming blockbuster all the more intense in the coming years.</p>
      <p>James Gunn's comments come from the recent Q&amp;A he did on his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jamesgunn/?hl=en">Instagram</a> story. The director regularly uses social media to communicate directly with the fandom, even after old tweets from a decade ago got him (briefly) fired from <i>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</i>. That drama was what led to Gunn signing on for <i>The Suicide Squad</i>, which he previously stated was the <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482180/james-gunn-says-the-suicide-squad-is-the-most-fun-movie-hes-directed">most fun he's had on a set</a>.</p>
      <p><i>The Suicide Squad</i> is one of the most intriguing upcoming DC movies, mostly because it'll be some combination of a sequel and a reboot. <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2480271/james-gunn-announces-full-cast-of-the-suicide-squad">A handful of characters</a> from David Ayer's original movie will be popping back up, with Viola Davis' Amanda Waller, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483218/joel-kinnaman-says-the-suicide-squad-is-like-shooting-his-first-comedy">Joel Kinnaman's Rick Flag</a> and Jai Courtney's Captain Boomerang returning alongside Harley Quinn.</p>

      <p>As for Margot Robbie, her third appearance as Harley has the potential to be her best outing yet. While <i>Birds of Prey</i> will <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2480489/birds-of-prey-margot-robbie-wanted-to-give-harley-friends">give the femme fatale friends</a>, she'll be back in the villain business with <i>The Suicide Squad</i>. The character should be much more developed and changed from David Ayer's original, especially when it comes to her relationship <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482661/james-gunn-explains-why-the-suicide-squad-doesnt-need-jared-letos-joker">with Jared Leto's Joker</a>.</p>
      <p>Margot Robbie's star power and acclaim has been steadily growing in the past few years, starting with her appearance in <i>The Wolf of Wall Street</i>. This lead to plenty of high profile gigs, including <i>I, Tonya</i>, <i>Once Upon A Time In Hollywood</i>, and <i>Bombshell</i>. But her name will seemingly be synonymous with Harley Quinn moving forward, as Warner Bros. continues her tenure in the DCEU.</p>
      <p><i>The Suicide Squad</i> will arrive in theaters on August 6, 2021.
