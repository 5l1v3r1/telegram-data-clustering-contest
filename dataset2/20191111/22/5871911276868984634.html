      <h1>Mark Jackson among candidates in potential Knicks' coaching search</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T22:51:50+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 22:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thesportsdaily.com/author/marcelovilla465/" target="_blank">Marcelo Villa</a></address>
      <p>With news coming out on Monday of the Knicks <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28058946/sources-knicks-president-angling-david-fizdale-firing">laying the groundwork to fire coach David Fizdale</a> after a poor start to the season, we’re learning of the potential candidates that could soon take over in New York, and one of them is a familiar face to Knicks fans.</p>
      <p>Mark Jackson, the former point guard and coach, who had multiple stints in New York during his playing days, is apparently a name to watch if the Knicks move on from Fizdale, according to Sports Illustrated’s Chris Mannix.</p>

      <p>On top of a long playing career, Jackson also coached the Golden State Warriors for three seasons in which he went 121-109 before getting replaced by Steve Kerr. Jackson’s name has come up frequently in recent coaching searches, and the Knicks do seem like a fit for him.</p>
      <p>We’ll see if he leaves the splendors of being a TV analyst to get back into coaching.</p>
