      <h1>James Maddison to be handed England debut in forthcoming Euro 2020 qualifiers</h1>
      <h2>Maddison has been in fine form for Leicester this season and is finally set to receive his senior England bow by Gareth Southgate this week</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T22:30:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">John Cross, https://www.facebook.com/johncrossmirror/</a></address>
      <p>James Maddison looks set to be given his England debut in one of their forthcoming Euro 2020 qualifiers.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> midfielder Maddison, 22, has now been in three of Gareth Southgate’s squads but has yet to get a single minute of football for England’s senior team.</p>
      <p>But Maddison’s form has impressed Southgate and his coaching staff enough for them to be talking in terms of giving him his chance amid midfield absences.</p>
      <p>Jordan Henderson will miss the Montenegro game on Thursday through suspension and has been given permission to only report up on Wednesday to give him some extra rest.</p>
      <p>Ross Barkley has had to withdraw through injury while Fabian Delph has also been troubled by a hamstring injury and the injuries may open the door for Maddison with England playing Kosovo on Sunday which means they may make changes with just two days in between games.</p>

      <p>Harry Winks impressed last time against Bulgaria while Declan Rice, Mason Mount and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain are also in the mix.</p>
      <p>England boss Southgate intends to speak to Maddison about his conduct as an international after he was pictured in a casino after being sent home ill from the last camp.</p>
      <p>But Southgate excused Maddison and that matter now seems over with the Leicester midfielder in his thoughts for the future.</p>
