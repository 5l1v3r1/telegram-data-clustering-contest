      <h3>What you need to know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Disney+ begins streaming for users on November 12.</li>
        <li>Only four of the Marvel movies will not be on Disney+ at launch.</li>
        <li>Those remaining Marvel movies will become available in early 2020.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Just like the movies that so many of us love from Disney, there is seemingly a last-minute bit of excitement before Disney+ goes live tomorrow. A <a href="https://twitter.com/disneyplus/status/1193985534927892480?s=20">new thread from the official Disney+ account</a> gave us an early present with newly announced Marvel titles for launch day. While we knew that there is already a very <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-movies-does-disney-plus-have">expansive list of movies,</a>that will be coming to Disney+ when the service begins streaming November 12, this update significantly fills in the gap for missing Marvel films.</p>
      <p>Originally expected to arrive on the service December 11 was Avengers: Endgame, which Disney <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/avengers-endgame-will-be-day-one-title-disney">announced last week</a> that it would now be available at launch. Today on Twitter, Disney confirmed that Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, The Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy, Captain America: Civil War, Doctor Strange, and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 would also be ready to go at launch. The only films that will be missing initially are Black Panther, Ant-Man and the Wasp, Avengers: Infinity War, and Thor: Ragnarok, which will be showing up at Disney+ after the contract with Netflix has expired — which should be early 2020.</p>
