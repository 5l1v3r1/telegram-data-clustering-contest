      <p>If you can't thank a veteran today, do the next best thing and donate to a non-veteran!</p>
      <p>President Trump's campaign fundraising team didn't miss a beat this Veterans Day, running a Facebook ad on Monday encouraging people to say "THANK YOU, VETERANS" by donating to the president's metaphorical war chest.</p>
      <p>Trump, who is not a veteran, <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/732435/john-mccain-takes-barely-veiled-swipe-trumps-vietnamdraftdeferring-bone-spurs">famously deferred</a> the Vietnam War draft several times.</p>

      <p>The ad, which includes a can't-miss 25 percent off coupon, provoked criticism of the president, with veteran <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkHertling/status/1193958069228560385">Mark Hertling pointing out</a> the somewhat bizarre timing of the Trump campaign's message. <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/877129/trump-must-pay-2-million-over-alleged-illegal-conduct-charity-judge-says">A judge ordered Trump to pay $2 million last week</a> over his alleged mishandling of funds for veterans, which were instead used for political purposes, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-veterans-day-parade-speech-watch-president-speaks-in-new-york-city-today-2019-11-11/">CBS News reports</a>.</p>

      <p>The president also celebrated the day by attending New York City's Veterans Day parade, where he <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-veterans-day-speech-honors-gold-star-families-after-feuds-2019-11">took the time to honor Gold Star families</a>, despite his history of feuding with several of them.</p>
      <p>Although if Trump really is burying the hatchet this Veterans Day, he should be sure to <a href="https://twitter.com/JuddLegum/status/1193924892007247872">get the date right</a> in next year's Facebook ad.</p>
