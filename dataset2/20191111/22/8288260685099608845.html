      <p> </p>
      <p><b>Stephen Massey:</b> I honestly think we’re a season away from playoffs. The last few games have proved the striking problems we face compared to better sides. Biggest mistake getting rid of Che Adams without replacing him.</p>
      <p><b>Martin Slater:</b> All depends what we do/are allowed to do in January. A finisher is a must, cut out the defensive errors and maybe get some half decent refs that are fair with both teams, and we might have a chance but I think we are a year away from challenging. Happy to be proved wrong though.</p>
      <p><b>Stephen James Smith:</b> That's a lot to ask. With a second striker and a replacement goalie of quality, it is achievable but I would prefer the lads enjoy their football and maybe develop some strength in depth for a push next season.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><b>Pauline Rose:</b> As long as we stay mid to top ten would be great achievement, we can win if we put our minds to it, but do need Camp to up his game or replace.</p>
      <p><b>Sid Hobday:</b> A season and a couple of transfer windows away from the play offs.</p>
      <p><b>Nick Courtney:</b> Hopefully safe. KRO.</p>
      <p><b>Craig Wright:</b> Let's face facts unless our away form changes we will be nowhere near the playoffs. We cant win 90% of our home games and pick hardly any points up off the road. Let alone the fact we need a striker, centre half and a new keeper. I have a feeling in January the only signing we will make is a striker and not one that will take us to the next level. Il be happy with a mid table finish this season.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><b>Keith Dandridge:</b> Camp this, Juke that. A goalkeeper is only as good as his last mistake, regardless of how many clean sheets he has acquired and Juke is not the only striker Blues have, but apart from that no chance of the play offs.</p>
      <p><b>Dan Paxton:</b> I’m sorry but we’re 6 points already away from the playoffs. I can’t see us being anywhere near them.</p>
      <p><b>Rob Robbins:</b> Not a chance, forget about it and keep squad together without selling anyone then build on it might stand a chance.</p>
      <p><b>Harry Boon:</b> Bottom 8, no goalscorer no points no hope!</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><b>Harry Clarke:</b> Not without new goal keeper another centre half, two strikers.</p>
      <p><b>Colin Perry:</b> No! Need a keeper a defender and a striker.</p>
      <p><b>John Bailey:</b> Play offs. Where does that come from. If only!</p>
