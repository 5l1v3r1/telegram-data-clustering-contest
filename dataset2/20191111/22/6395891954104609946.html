      <p><b>COLUMBUS, OhioÂ (AP)</b> - The NHL has suspended Columbus forward Nick Foligno for three games for a hit that leveled Colorado Avalanche forward Pierre-Edouard Bellemare.</p>
      <p>The Department of Player Safety announced the penalty for the Blue Jackets captain on Monday.</p>
      <p>Foligno dropped Bellemare with the open-ice hit with his elbow to Bellemare's jaw at 17:15 of the second period Saturday. Foligno said he hadn't intended to hurt Bellemare and "felt sick to my stomach when I saw that I hit him in the head."</p>
      <p>Foligno was assessed a major penalty and game misconduct for charging.</p>
      <p>He said he traded text messages with Bellemare after the game to make sure he was OK.</p>
      <p>The NHL says the suspension will cost Foligno $88,709.67.</p>
