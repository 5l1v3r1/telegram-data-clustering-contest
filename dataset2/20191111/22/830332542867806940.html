      <p>MADISON, Wis. - A Republican legislator is resurrecting a resolution that would officially declare the evergreen the state Department of Administration places in the state Capitol every year a Christmas tree.</p>
      <p>Democratic Gov. Tony Evers called the tree a holiday tree Friday, a departure from his predecessor, Republican Scott Walker, who called it a Christmas tree. Republican Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald called Evers' decision to rename the tree "'PC' garbage."</p>
      <p>Rep. Scott Krug introduced a resolution Monday declaring the tree the Wisconsin State Christmas Tree. The Republican-controlled Assembly passed the same resolution in 2007 but the proposal died in Senate.</p>
      <p>Krug's resolution can't pass before Christmas. The Assembly's last 2019 floor session is Tuesday and Krug has given co-sponsors until Friday to sign on to the proposal.</p>
