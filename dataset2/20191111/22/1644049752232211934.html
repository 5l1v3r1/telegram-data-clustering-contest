      <p>A Singaporean baggage handler has been jailed for 20 days for swapping tags on nearly 300 suitcases at the city-state’s airport, causing them to end up at wrong destinations around the world.</p>
      <p>Tay Boon Keh, 66, had pleaded guilty to charges of swapping the tags on 286 bags at Changi Airport, one of the world’s busiest hubs.</p>
      <p>He made the swaps between November 2016 and February 2017 out of “frustration and anger” after his request for additional staff at his work section was ignored, a district court heard.</p>
      <p>Suitcases originally bound for various parts of the world, including Perth, Manila, Frankfurt, London and San Francisco, were affected, according to court documents.</p>
      <p>The bags belonged to passengers transiting through Changi and using Singapore Airlines and its regional wing SilkAir.</p>
      <p>Tay was suffering from major depressive disorder when he committed the offences, the court heard.</p>
      <p>But state prosecutors said evidence presented at a hearing showed his condition “did not contribute significantly to his commission of the offences” as he continued to have control over his actions.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Thiam Jia Min said the swapping could have caused “potentially, even serious or fatal, consequences” as some passengers could have been left without medications.</p>
      <p>Changi handled nearly 65.6 million passengers last year.</p>
