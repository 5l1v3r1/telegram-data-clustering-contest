      <p>Although we recently revisited <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1663460/upcoming-fast-and-furious-movies-list-of-titles-and-release-dates">the <i>Fast &amp; Furious</i> universe</a> through <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483009/a-very-specific-fast-and-furious-scene-led-to-the-creation-of-hobbs-and-shaw">the spinoff <i>Hobbs &amp; Shaw</i></a>, it’s been two years since the last main installment, <i>The Fate of the Furious</i>, screened to the masses. But for those of you who’ve been eager to reunite with Dominic Toretto and his crew, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1708819/fast-and-furious-9-what-we-know-so-far"><i>Fast &amp; Furious 9</i></a> has just wrapped filming, and here’s how director Justin Lin celebrated the milestone.</p>

      <p>Nothing summarizes the movie-making process more than showing one of the cameras that helped capture the story that will eventually be shown on the big screen. Justin Lin also thanked the <i>Fast &amp; Furious 9</i> crew for all their hard work across the many locations where production took place, and went so far as to call this the “most ambitious film” of the <i>Fast &amp; Furious</i> series. That’s high praise!</p>
      <p><i>Fast &amp; Furious 9</i> began filming in late June, meaning that principal photography lasted for almost five full months. Now that cameras are finished rolling, per <a href="https://twitter.com/justinlin/status/1193774757172264961">Justin Lin’s Twitter post</a>, that means it’s time for Justin Lin and the postproduction team to edit the footage together into the final product that audiences will watch in a half year’s time.</p>
      <p>Speaking of which, although there have been plenty of behind-the-scenes looks at <i>Fast &amp; Furious 9</i> over the last several months, we haven’t been treated to any official pictures or footage yet. Now that filming is completed, perhaps that means a trailer could be on the way soon. Remember, <i>The Fate of the Furious</i> <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1598890/the-fate-of-the-furious-trailer-fast-8-looks-ridiculous-and-crazy">aired its first trailer in December 2016</a>, so Universal could follow suit next month with the first <i>Fast &amp; Furious 9</i> preview.</p>
      <p>One would imagine that trailer will provide the first <i>Fast &amp; Furious 9</i> story details, as information concerning the plot has been kept close to the proverbial chest. <i>The Fate of the Furious</i> ended with Dominic Toretto being reunited with his son and celebrating with his teammates and allies over their latest win. While we’ve since seen <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483062/why-the-samoan-set-pieces-were-the-hardest-to-pull-off-in-hobbs-and-shaw">what Luke Hobbs and Deckard Shaw have been up to</a> after those events, we’re still in the dark about what Dom and his crew have gotten themselves into for <i>Fast &amp; Furious 9</i>.</p>
      <p>What we do know is who will comprise the core cast. Along with mainstays like Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Ludacris, Tyrese Gibson and Nathalie Emmanuel, <i>Fast &amp; Furious 9</i> will also see the return of <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481208/fast-and-furious-9-is-going-old-school-for-mia-toretto">Jordana Brewster’s Mia Toretto</a>, Charlize Theron’s Cipher and Helen Mirren’s Magdalene Shaw. The movie’s newcomers include characters played by Michael Rooker, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482097/john-cena-has-wrapped-on-fast-and-furious-9-according-to-vin-diesel">John Cena</a>, Finn Cole, Anna Sawai, Vinnie Bennett, Ozuna and <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482922/surprise-cardi-b-has-joined-fast-and-furious-9">Cardi B</a>.</p>
      <p>This marks Justin Lin’s fourth outing in the Fast &amp; Furious franchise, having previously directed <i>Fast &amp; Furious</i>, <i>Fast Five</i> and <i>Fast &amp; Furious 6</i>. Lin is also set to helm <i>Fast &amp; Furious 10</i>, which is still set to be the final installment of the main film series. Chris Morgan and Daniel Casey wrote the <i>Fast &amp; Furious 9</i> script.</p>
      <p><i>Fast &amp; Furious 9</i> races into theaters on May 22, 2020, so keep checking back with CinemaBlend for continuing coverage.
