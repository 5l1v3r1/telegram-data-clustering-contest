      <h1>The gutsy Billy Gilmour Rangers decision that Scotland kids can take inspiration from</h1>
      <h2>Scot Gemmill has hailed Gilmour for making the fearless leap to Chelsea and moving to London.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T22:29:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 22:29</time> by <a rel="author">Gordon Parks, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/gordon-parks/</a></address>
      <p>Scot Gemmill says <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scotland-football-team">Scotland</a> now have a factory line of fearless kids with the bottle to compete against the best in the business.</p>
      <p>The Under-21 boss goes into Friday’s clash with Greece at Tynecastle looking to see his side stay top of their Euro 2021 qualifying group.</p>
      <p>Two wins and two draws have fuelled belief this squad can be the first to reach the finals since 1996.</p>
      <p>Gemmill is adamant a mentality change and the rise of starlets like Chelsea’s <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/billy-gilmour">Billy Gilmour</a> is helping them meet every challenge.</p>

      <p>He said: “I know from my experience working with the best young players in the country that the mentality has improved.</p>
      <p>“They have a belief when they go to play at the younger age groups. They’re not intimidated by anyone.</p>
      <p>“They take confidence from the preparation that all the national teams use.</p>
      <p>“They are all aligned in how they prepare for games.</p>
      <p>“The behaviour of the players, individually and collectively, has improved.</p>
      <p>“The players have taken confidence from the performances and they have progressed. I worked with a lot of the boys at Under-17 level, and the nucleus of the squad have experience of international football.</p>
      <p>“The players are willing to do the work to show they can be trusted.”</p>

      <p>Gemmill says former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> kid Gilmour is an example of youngsters being able to cope with high expectations, and develop good discipline and habits.</p>
      <p>He said: “I don’t get to see the players that much off the pitch so I don’t really see how they live their lives away from football.</p>
      <p>“You have to trust them, but the pathway they are on is constantly testing them.</p>
      <p>“The changes in Billy’s life have been huge, in terms of signing for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> and moving to London.</p>
      <p>“It is a huge testament to him what he has achieved, and other players as well.</p>
      <p>“They might not be under the same scrutiny as Billy, but they have remained on the right track.</p>
      <p>“They don’t get distracted by off-the-field things. Historically that hasn’t been the case with the best young players.”</p>
