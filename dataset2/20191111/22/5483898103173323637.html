      <p>On Tuesday morning the CFS confirmed the Duck Ponds fire near Port Lincoln had been contained:</p>
      <blockquote>CFS advises that this fire is now contained. Fire activity and weather conditions on the fireground have abated with decreasing winds, rising relative humidity and low temperatures providing relief to firefighting efforts.<br/><br/>Multiple CFS crews have been working overnight to strengthen the fire edge. Replacement CFS, MFS and National Parks crews are heading to the fireground to continue operations. Hot spots and burning trees within the fireground are likely to burn for several days and may produce smoke.<br/><br/>Aircraft located at Port Lincoln overnight will conduct an assessment of the fireground this morning.<br/><br/>A Rapid Damage Assessment Team has arrived in Port Lincoln and will be conducting assessments of properties impacted by this fire today.<br/><br/>The public are asked to avoid the area. Emergency vehicles area operating in this area and smoke is still present, reducing visibility on some roads. Please drive to the conditions.</blockquote>
