      <p>Decades after being in the Army, a 91-year-old Jamaican immigrant fought back tears as he became an American citizen on Veterans Day.</p>
      <p>Linval Lindsay was one of a dozen veteran immigrants from nine countries who became a United States citizen during a naturalization ceremony in New York on Monday. The ceremony was hosted by Fox News, with Trump administration official Ken Cuccinelli administering the oath.</p>
      <p>“It has been very emotional for me today. I’ve been postponing this thing for the longest time. I finally decided to do it and I’m so happy I did, and I didn’t know it would have been so emotional, but it is,” Lindsay said Monday, more than 50 years after he served in the armed forces.</p>
      <p>Lindsay said that he was drafted and spent two years serving in Greenland.</p>
      <p>“The Army has been my, one of the best two years of my life, really,” Lindsay said, noting that when he was drafted, his mother cried. “I’m happy she cried, because today I’m happy I went in the Army.”</p>
      <p>When asked what the American flag meant to him, Lindsay said it meant “everything.” He said that although he still loves his home country of Jamaica, he is proud to be a citizen.</p>
      <p>“I’m an American now,” Lindsay said, wiping tears from his eyes.</p>

      <p>President Trump <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/91-year-old-veteran-becomes-us-citizen">recorded</a> a video message that was played for those at the ceremony.</p>
      <p>“There is no higher honor, there is no greater responsibility,” Trump said. “You now share the obligation to teach our values to others, to help newcomers assimilate to our way of life and uplift America by living according to its highest ideals of self-governance and its highest standards."</p>
      <p>“All Americans are your brothers and sisters, and each of us must do our part to keep America safe, strong, and free,” he added.</p>
