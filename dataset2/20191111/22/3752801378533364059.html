      <p>City of Tshwane officials hope Tshwane Bus Services (TBS) will be back in operation by Tuesday afternoon - pending the outcome of negotiations, the City said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"All Tshwane Bus Services will remain suspended until tomorrow afternoon [Tuesday], pending the outcome of the negotiations between the employer and labour," mayoral committee for transport Sheila Senkubunge said.</p>
      <p>In a press release on Sunday, the City warned commuters the strike was "due to workers being unhappy with the pace at which the process of conducting benchmarking salaries is taking place".</p>
      <p>Many commuters were left stranded due to Monday's protest, with Senkubunge issuing an apology "for the inconvenience caused by workers who responded to ongoing wage negotiations and its pending outcomes".</p>
      <p>Further in the statement, Senkubunge asked that commuters should exercise patience.</p>
      <p>"This [suspension of services] is done in the interests of ensuring safety for our customers and safeguarding the City's assets."</p>
      <p>Senkubunge added commuters would be kept abreast of any developments "in due course".  </p>
