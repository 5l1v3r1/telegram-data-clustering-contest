      <h2>Liverpool hold an eight point lead at the top of the Premier League table following their demolition of Manchester City at Anfield on Sunday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T22:30:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">John Cross, https://www.facebook.com/johncrossmirror/</a></address>
      <p>Virgil van Dijk insists Liverpool have learned from the painful lessons of last season and will not let the title slip again.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> had an eight point gap over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> last season but Pep Guardiola’s men pegged them back in the most exciting title race in Premier League history.</p>
      <p>Van Dijk finds himself top of the pile again going into the international break with a nine point lead over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> while they are nine ahead of City.</p>
      <p>But while Liverpool lost last season at the Etihad and then dropped crucial points at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> , the Dutch defender believes that experience will actually help them this time.</p>
      <p>Van Dijk believes it is crucial they keep pushing themselves to improve to not let City back in and says their mentality will be the key to winning the title.</p>

      <p>“We took a lot of experience last year,” said van Dijk. “Good things, but also some things we should have done better. Hopefully we can only make sure we react better and do better.</p>
      <p>“You need to have that bit of luck as well throughout the whole season so at the moment we are very happy. We drew one game and won the others and hopefully we can keep it going.</p>
      <p>“We did everything possible. We shouldn’t have any regrets from last year. They were just outstanding. We kept pushing them and they kept pushing us and you have to respect that and I certainly do.</p>
      <p>“This year is a new chance for more teams, for both of us and the only focus is the game ahead of us, we have so many difficult periods of games with so many competitions, travelling and hopefully no injuries, no illness, so anything can happen.</p>

      <p>“Obviously, we are in a very good situation. That is something we can’t deny. We all feel and we know the season is too long to celebrate that we are nine points ahead or something and we won’t.</p>
      <p>“The mentality we have is we just have to carry on and keep doing better than we have done already. That is the mentality we should take into every game.”</p>
      <p>City’s remarkable fight back last year will give Guardiola confidence they can do it again and it will also serve as a warning to Liverpool who face a daunting December fixture list with the Club World Cup looking large as well as the Carabao Cup quarter final and festive period.</p>

      <p>But Liverpool’s impressive victory over the reigning champions has sent out a message and given them belief that this can be their year to end Anfield’s 30 year wait for the championship.</p>
      <p>Van Dijk added: “I think it was very big to get the three points against the champions. A very tough game. It looked like a shaky start, you give four set-pieces away and you have to find a rhythm again.</p>
      <p>“Our mentality is we shouldn’t get carried away, nine (sic) points clear, we are very happy with the situation but there are so many difficult teams to beat in the league, so many difficult grounds to go to that we all have in our minds that we shouldn’t get carried away. We will see.</p>
      <p>“They (Chelsea and Leicester) have been doing very well and even if you look at Sheffield United, they are a very difficult team to beat so I know, everyone here as well knows as well how difficult this year will be.</p>
      <p>“But we shouldn’t look too much at others teams, we should look at the teams we face and City are the champions and we did the job and hopefully we can keep that focus for the next games.”</p>
