      <p>Magento's Security Team urged users to install the latest released security update to protect their stores from exploitation attempts trying to abuse a recently reported remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability.</p>
      <p>The issue is impacting Magento Commerce 2.3.1 and Magento Commerce 2.3.2 were security-only patch 2.3.2-p2 was not installed, as well as unsupported versions of Page Builder, such as Page Builder Beta.</p>
      <p>"Merchants running Magento Commerce 2.3.x should install the latest security update to help protect their stores from potential malicious attacks that could exploit a <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-8144">vulnerability</a> in preview methods," Magento said.</p>
      <p>"This vulnerability could enable an unauthenticated user to insert a malicious payload into a merchant’s site and execute it, which is why we recommend installing this update."</p>
      <h3>Recommended actions for unpatched Magento stores</h3>
      <p>The security issue tracked as <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-8144">CVE-2019-8144</a> was addressed in the Magento 2.3.3 release and the security-only patch Magento 2.3.2-p2 releases <a href="https://magento.com/security/patches/magento-2.3.3-and-2.2.10-security-update">issued on October 8, 2019</a>.</p>
      <p>The Magento Security Team also recommends merchants who have patched their systems against the vulnerability to "review the security of their Magento site to confirm that it was not potentially compromised before upgrade" since applying the security update does not mitigate the effects stemming from earlier attacks. </p>
      <p>Users are advised to take the following measures as soon as possible:</p>
      <p>
        <b>For Magento 2.3.1 merchants:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Install the MDVA-22979_EE_2.3.1_v1 patch now, and then schedule your upgrade to 2.3.3 or 2.3.2-p2 as soon as possible.</li>
        <li>Review your site and your server for signs of potential compromise.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>For Magento 2.3.2 merchants:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Install MDVA-22979_EE_2.3.2_v1 patch now, then schedule your upgrade to 2.3.3 or 2.3.2-p2 as soon as possible.</li>
        <li>Review your site and your server for signs of potential compromise.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Magento Security Team says that merchants can download the two patches listed above from their account on the magento.com platform.</p>
      <p>Magento Commerce cloud customers are already protected, with measures having been implemented for all of them to block exploit attempts of the CVE-2019-8144 vulnerability.</p>
      <p>"However, this action will have the side effect of blocking administrators from viewing previews for products, blocks, and dynamic blocks," the <a href="https://magento.com/security/patches/latest-magento-security-update-helps-protect-recently-reported-rce-vulnerability">Magento Security Team concludes</a>. "We will re-enable the preview functionality as soon as possible."</p>
      <h3>Magecart gangs threatening unpatched Magento stores</h3>
      <p>Merchants who use Magento Commerce to power their online stores are constantly targeted by the so-called <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/magecart/">Magecart groups</a>, notorious threat actors that exploit vulnerable stores as part of e-skimming attacks.</p>
      <p>These cybercrime groups have been active since at least 2010 according to <a href="https://www.riskiq.com/research/magecart-growing-threat/">a RiskIQ report from October</a> and they are known to focus on Magento-powered e-commerce sites, although they've recently expanded to <a href="http://www.riskiq.com/blog/labs/magecart-beyond-magento/">also include OpenCart, PrismWeb, ​​​​​​and OSCommerce-powered online stores in their campaigns</a>.</p>
      <p>RiskIQ's Magecart report published last month estimates that these gangs' web skimming operations may have already impacted millions of users, with the company's telemetry data showing a total of 2,086,529 instances of Magecart detections.</p>

      <p>During 2019 alone, Magecart gangs ran card skimming campaigns that successfully <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/automated-magecart-campaign-hits-over-960-breached-stores/">breached 962 e-commerce stores</a>, injected a payment card skimming script within PrismWeb-powered <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/over-200-college-campus-stores-infected-with-card-stealing-scripts/">checkout pages of hundreds of online campus stores</a>, and used <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-steal-payment-card-data-using-rogue-iframe-phishing/">upgraded credit card stealer scripts</a> employing an iframe-based phishing system.</p>
      <p>They also developed <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/polymorphic-magecart-skimmer-uses-over-fifty-payment-gateways/">a polymorphic Magecart skimmer script</a> that comes with support for 57 payment gateways and can easily be injected within almost any checkout page of any online shop to start scraping customers' payment info automatically without the need of customization.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-warns-govt-agencies-smbs-to-defend-against-e-skimming-threats/">issued a warning last month to increase awareness on current e-skimming threats</a> known to target small and medium-sized businesses, as well as government agencies that process online payments.</p>
