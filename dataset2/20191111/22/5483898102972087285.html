      <h3>New statistics back up the sense that drug-fuelled crime is on the rise in South Australia, says FIVEaa Breakfast’s David Penberthy.</h3>
      <p>Penbo said during Tuesday’s Breaking @ 8 segment:</p>
      <blockquote>“We are spending more time talking about pub thefts, home invasions, servo robberies, desperate criminal acts often fuelled by drugs… well there’s some statistics that have been released… that actually put the numbers behind what feels like a hunch. You get the sense something is happening.<br/><br/>“The crime statistics in South Australia over the last 12 months absolutely confirm that criminal behaviour has changed and it’s not something the police are making any secret about…”</blockquote>
      <p>According the stats, <b>illicit drug offences are up by 35 per cent</b> from 4,144 in 2017/18 to 5,594 in 2018/19.</p>
      <p><b>Theft and related offences have increased 12.5 per cent</b> from 44,405 to 49,945.</p>
      <p><b>Offences against property -- cars, houses and businesses -- are up by 8.4 per cent</b> from 84,060 to 91,084.</p>
      <p>At least <b>offences against people are down by 7 per cent</b>.</p>
      <p>Penbo said:</p>
      <blockquote>“You would have to think the extent to which the reliance and addiction to drugs -- and when we say drugs, invariably we’re talking about ice in this state -- has been the driver in the big increase in theft and related offences…<br/><br/>“There’s a societal issue there about the extent to which addiction and dependence is spinning out of control for so many more people… pretty grim statistics.”</blockquote>
