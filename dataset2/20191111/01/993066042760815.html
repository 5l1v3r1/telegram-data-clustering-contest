      <p>THE Tyrone Division One final was marred by a brawl in the closing stages of the clash between Dromore and Errigal Ciaran.</p>
      <p>Five players were sent off after fighting erupted late on at Fintona, where Dromore held on to lift the title with a four-point (1-10 to 1-6) win over the defending champions.</p>
      <p>Errigal Ciaran's Niall Kelly and Eoin Kelly were shown red cards, as were Dromore pair Sean McNabb and Paul McHugh.</p>
      <p>And Errigal finished with 12 men after Ben McDonnell picked up a second yellow card. The county board is set to launch an investigation into the incidents which cast a shadow on one of the most high-profile occasions of the club season in the Red Hand county.</p>
      <p>“An otherwise sporting game was interrupted by a brief but unacceptable sequence of events in the closing stages,” said Tyrone PRO Eugene McConnell.</p>
      <p>“The Tyrone Competitions Control Committee will await the report of the referee and a full investigation will be carried out.”</p>
      <p>Ryan McCusker's second-half goal was the vital score that put daylight between the sides, after the St Dympna's had fought back.</p>
      <p>They trailed by two points at the interval, with Errigal's first-half goal coming from a Peter Harte penalty. Davy Harte and Peter Harte had early points for the Dunmoyle men, with Sean McNabb responding at the other end in a low-scoring opening quarter.</p>
      <p>But the game sprang to life when a foul on Errigal captain Peter Harte earned his side a penalty, and he took the kick himself, slotting the ball low to the corner of the net to give the holders a significant advantage. Niall Sludden responded with a brilliantly executed score, with Cahir Goodwin also on target for the men from Gardrum Park.</p>
      <p>Sean McNabb and Eoin McCusker also found the target, but Mark Kavanagh sent Errigal in at the break with a 1-4 to 0-5 advantage.</p>
      <p>It was Dromore who stepped up their level of performance in the second half, with Emmet McNabb, McCusker and Tyrone star Sludden, with another brilliant score, getting them in front.</p>
      <p>The excellent Sludden was central to the move which led to Ryan McCusker's goal, and they finished strongly with scores from skipper Eoin McCusker and Ronan McNabb.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Edendork were relegated to Division Two after losing a sudden death play-off to Eglish by 2-9 to 1-10.</p>
