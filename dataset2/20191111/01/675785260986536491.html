      <h2>The Gypsy King has hinted he may never box in the UK again - but Tyrell Fortune wants him to join Bellator in MMA switch</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T01:47:13+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 01:47</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Tyson Fury has hinted he may never again fight in the UK, throwing into doubt potential fights against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/deontay-wilder">Deontay Wilder</a> and Anthony Joshua.</p>
      <p>And Fury's links with a switch to MMA continue after the lineal heavyweight champion was called out by Bellator 233 winner Tyrell Fortune.</p>
      <p>After his recent excursions into WWE, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tyson-fury">Fury</a> is expected to return to the boxing ring to fight WBC heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder on February 22.</p>
      <p>However, first Wilder must defend his title against Luis Ortiz on November 23.</p>
      <p>Fury has also been linked with an all-British bout against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/anthony-joshua">Anthony Joshua</a> - but he has cast doubt on that prospect by saying he wants to continue fighting abroad rather than in the UK.</p>

      <p>Speaking from the US about the UK boxing scene, the Gypsy King told the <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/tyson-fury-interview-the-boxer-on-fighting-depression-and-his-inner-demons-g56wnztdr">Times</a> : "They had their chance.</p>
      <p>"They didn’t treat me well. Over here, I get treated like a superstar.”</p>
      <p>His remarks could also have implications for the Wilder fight, with many fans having hoped to see the rematch at a UK venue such as Old Traford.</p>
      <p>Most of Fury's fights have been in the UK, but his last three bouts were in the US. However, after making his WWE debut in Saudi Arabia, he did return to the UK to take part in Smackdown in his home town of Manchester.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Tyrell Fortune says Bellator could offer Fury a route into MMA if he wants to switch sports rather than return to boxing.</p>
      <p>Fury has teased a transition into mixed martial arts, having <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/other-sports/mma/tyson-fury-trains-ufc-star-20848333">worked on his fighting skills with British UFC fighter Darren Till</a> .</p>
      <p>Speaking after his second-round TKO win over Azunna Anyanwu at Bellator 233, Fortune called on Bellator president Scott Coker to sign Fury up.</p>
      <p>“Fury talked to (UFC president) Dana White and he wanted to get into MMA, and Dana White said he didn’t want to take the fight,” said Fortune in quotes reported by <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2019/11/tyrell-fortune-says-jake-hager-out-of-my-league-wants-tyson-fury-boxing-mma-bellator-233-video">MMA Junkie</a> .</p>
      <p>“So if Scott Coker wants to sign Fury, I’d be willing to knock his ass out.”</p>
      <p>Fortune's coach wants him to fight WWE star Jake Hager.</p>
      <p>But Fortune said: " <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tyson-fury">Tyson Fury</a> ’s better than Swagger. At least that’s some competition. Swagger... still ain’t punching people. He’s still trying to take them down."</p>
