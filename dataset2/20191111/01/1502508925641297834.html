      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/pollution">Pollution </a>in New Delhi on Monday morning fell to "very poor" after being "poor" as the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/air-quality">air quality </a>index (AQI) slipped to 346 at 7:00 am, according to System of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/air-quality">Air Quality </a>and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR).</p>
      <p>The AQI in adjoining areas of Noida, Gurgaon was registered at 315 and 355 respectively.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/air-quality">Air quality </a>in the city improved from "very poor" to "poor" on Saturday and Sunday because of wind speed.</p>
      <p>It was a cold breezy Monday morning with the minimum temperature settling at 16 degrees Celsius.</p>
      <p>Humidity was recorded at 66 per cent.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, the maximum and minimum temperatures were recorded at 28 degrees Celsius and 16 degrees Celsius respectively.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, acting on a slew of directions from the Supreme Court, implementing agencies have taken "major action" at 13 <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/pollution">pollution </a>hot spots in the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/current-affairs-news-national-1150106.htm">national </a>capital, including closing 23 polluting industrial units, over the last three days, officials said on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Municipal corporations have lifted 400 metric tonnes of construction and demolition waste and 1,200 metric tonne garbage during the period, they said.</p>
      <p>After the apex court directed a three-member Monitoring Committee to oversee the implementation of pollution-control measures, its chairman Bhure Lal visited the hotspots of Wazirpur, Ashok Vihar, Punjabi Bagh, Dwarka and R.K.Puram on November 8 and Narela, Bawana, Jahangirpuri, and Mundka on November 9, according to the officials.</p>
