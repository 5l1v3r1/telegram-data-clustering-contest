      <p>A MAN whose living room and kitchen windows were blown out after an air freshener exploded said he and his family were lucky to be alive.</p>
      <p>The explosion happened in the living room of the house in Lagmore Meadows, west Belfast, around 11pm on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, the living room and kitchen windows had been boarded up after the glass and PVC frames were blown out by the force of the blast.</p>
      <p>The man, who did no wish to be identified, said two children were asleep upstairs and four adults were in the kitchen when the explosion occurred.</p>

      <p>He said they were "still in shock" but felt "lucky to be alive" and that things could have turned out very differently, particularly if they had been in the living room at the time.</p>

      <p>A woman in the house was also treated for injuries after falling down stairs in the ensuing panic.</p>
      <p>The man said the stove on which the air freshener sat had been lit that night for the first time in months.</p>
      <p>The explosion forced open the door connecting the living room and the kitchen, with splintered wood on the panels evidence of what had taken place.</p>

      <p>Ironically, items in the living room including a mirror, TV and lamp were not damaged in the blast.</p>
      <p>The NI Fire and Rescue Service (NIFRS) said the explosion was caused by an air freshener that had heated up after being placed on a wood-burning stove.</p>
      <p>NIFRS Assistant Group Commander Michael Roberts said the 39-year-old woman was treated for pelvic injuries after falling as she came down the stairs.</p>
      <p>He told the BBC it was a significant explosion and that there could have been "different circumstances" had someone been in the living room when the blast happened.</p>

      <p>Group Commander Roberts said the heated aerosol had ruptured causing an "overpressure" in the house, which blew out the windows.</p>
      <p>He added that damage was "very minimal" and that an explosion of that nature was "very rare" in his 27 years as a firefighter.</p>
      <p>"I would ask the public to be vigilant, always store any aerosol canisters away from any source of heat or naked flame," he said.</p>
