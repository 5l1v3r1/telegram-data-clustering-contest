      <p>HAVE you noticed that software companies are now taking it upon themselves to update your phone without even asking permission?</p>
      <p>We get a message saying that they have installed the latest fancy update, and it is now in place on our phone - not that it makes any noticeable difference – and we forget about it, and get on with our day.</p>
      <p>Well, this is the way we deal with our retirement planning, too. It all happens in the background, we hardly ever think about it. I mean, if nothing has gone wrong, all has to be going right ..... right? Far from it.</p>
      <p>Last week we talked about the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association (PLSA) and their new figures, linking how much you are saving today to what your lifestyle will be, when you retire.</p>
      <p>They gave some very handy examples of how much you will need to cover your basic costs (that would be £10,200 a year), or to have a moderate lifestyle (£20,200), or to have a comfortable lifestyle (£33,000).</p>
      <p>If you look a bit deeper into the excellent work the PLSA has done lately, you will see that their major concern is that nearly all of us are not saving enough to be comfortable. The stock phrases never change: we are ‘saving blind', ‘sleepwalking into retirement', sitting on a ‘pensions time bomb'.</p>
      <p>Maybe we might even be heading for a day when, as far as keeping warm with spiralling fuel costs goes, the choice will be: heat or eat?</p>
      <p>The Pension Commission have what they call a ‘Target Replacement Rate' (TRR), which is their view of how much an average earner should be aiming for in retirement. It's currently £19,162 a year.</p>
      <p>However, given that over half of us (51 per cent or 13.6 million people) are unlikely to even attain the minimum recommended by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) of £9,998, it's easy to see that most of us aren't even close to that £19,162 (JRF monitors and works to eradicate poverty).</p>
      <p>The other issue is that, when we get to retirement, we are now free to fleece ourselves and incur huge tax liabilities by siphoning off cash, without guidance or advice, from our pension.</p>
      <p>There is nothing that will bring a financial adviser to tears more than a totally avoidable and unnecessary tax bill.</p>
      <p>Since 2015, we have had the freedom to strip cash out of our pensions, rather than buying an annuity, and between us we have drawn down about £30.74 billion since then.</p>
      <p>Now. Would you take your car to bits if there was a problem? You would not. You would call in an expert, because the car is worth £15,000. When it comes to our pension savings, though, which average at about £30,000, we seem to be less careful.</p>
      <p>Canada Life reckon that only a third of people asked advice from an independent financial expert before taking a bite out of their pension savings, which often meant that the taxman got to take a bite as well – he is the best-fed man in the country.</p>
      <p>They said: “The taxation of pension freedoms withdrawals is a confusing mess, which can leave people facing shock emergency tax bills running into thousands of pounds.”</p>
      <p>There are also issues if you decide to bite into your pension early – which you can do from 55. Of course it's tempting, but you have to remember that it's a wodge of cash saved for a particular purpose – to keep the two of you warm and fed, and you are likely to live until well into your 70s.</p>
      <p>The poor old NHS, for all its woes, is doing a great job. See them tablets the doctor gave you? They weren't available for your grandparents. As a result, life expectancy in Northern Ireland, which was about 60 a century ago, is now 78.5 years for a man and 82.3 years for a woman.</p>
      <p>Is the power steering a bit gone in your retirement planning? Do you want to get your pension car back on the road?</p>
