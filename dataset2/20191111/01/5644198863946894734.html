      <p>Novak Djokovic ruthlessly took Matteo Berrettini apart at the ATP Finals on Sunday as he began his quest to reclaim the number one ranking by winning his opening group match 6-2 6-1.</p>
      <p>LONDON: Novak Djokovic ruthlessly took Matteo Berrettini apart at the ATP Finals on Sunday as he began his quest to reclaim the number one ranking by winning his opening group match 6-2 6-1.</p>
      <p>Berrettini became the first Italian to play in the season-ending showpiece since 1978 but was given a harsh lesson by the 16-time Grand Slam champion at the O2 Arena.</p>

      <p>The 32-year-old Djokovic began the match 640 points behind Rafael Nadal in the race to end the year on top of the rankings, but victory chipped that advantage down to 440.</p>
      <p>Djokovic must at least win two group matches and reach the final to have any chance of matching Pete Sampras's record of ending six separate years as world number one.</p>
      <p>Spaniard Nadal, who has concerns over an abdominal injury sustained at the Paris Masters, plays his first group match on Monday against defending champion Alexander Zverev.</p>
      <p>As an opening singles match in a tournament featuring the world's best eight tennis players, it was a disappointing display.</p>
      <p>But five-time champion Djokovic had some sympathy for an opponent who only booked his place last week and who was ill-equipped to deal with the relentless pressure the Serb applied.</p>
      <p>"I remember when I played for the first time in the ATP Tour Finals in 2007, I lost all three matches in the group," he said.</p>
      <p>"I was tense. It's a lot of pressure mentally, that you have to deliver your best, where for us guys that have been playing on the top level for many years, we have the experience."</p>
      <p>Djokovic, four times a winner of the title since the tournament moved to London in 2009, had never played Berrettini before but quickly got to grips with the aggressive style of the 23-year-old Italian.</p>
      <p>The first four games were shared on serve but Djokovic seized the opening break when Berrettini snatched at a routine forehand at 2-3 and quickly took charge.</p>
      <p>His only blemish was when serving at 4-0 in the second set, gifting Berrettini a break with a couple of errors, but normal service was quickly resumed as he finished things off in little more than an hour with an easy forehand.</p>
      <p>Djokovic will face Roger Federer, who he beat in an epic Wimbledon final this year, either on Tuesday or Thursday depending on how the Swiss, bidding to win a record seventh title at the season-ending event, does against Dominic Thiem in Sunday's second singles match.</p>
      <p>Berrettini will at least get the chance to make more of an impression in his second match.</p>
      <p>"I was nervous but not in a bad way," he said. "Normally when I step in the court and I don't feel nervous, something is wrong. I have to feel nervous to play my best tennis."</p>
