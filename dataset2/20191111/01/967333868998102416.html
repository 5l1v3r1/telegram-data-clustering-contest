        <b>A progressive Congresswoman and staunch critic of Tel Aviv, Ilhan Omar is again the centre of controversy after suggesting that several US politicians hold pro-Israel positions because they receive cash political donations from the pro-Israel lobby.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Accusations of anti-Semitism have again been launched at Democratic Representative Ilhan Omar from Minnesota on Saturday, after she tweeted in response to a report that businessman Leon Cooperman had announced his support for former <a href="https://sputniknews.com/analysis/201911081077260170-michael-bloombergs-entry-means-trump-knocked-sleepy-joe-biden-out-of-2020-race-us-journo/">New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's 2020 presidential bid.</a></p>
      <p>The freshman Democrat tweeted, "I wonder why?" on Saturday afternoon in response to the article, punctuating the question with a thinking emoji.</p>

      <p>​Responses were quick, with Michael Dickson, executive director of an anti-racist group Stand with Us, tweeting:</p>
      <blockquote>“I suppose you think it’s all about the Benjamins. We get your insinuation. True to form”.</blockquote>

      <p>Political analyst and executive director  of the Israeli-Jewish Congress, Arsen Ostrovsky, tweeted: "Oh gee, please do enlighten us again, because you were in such 'fine form' before..." while reposting the previous "all about the Benjamins tweet", which previously <a href="https://sputniknews.com/analysis/201903051072956144-unjustified-smears-ilhan-omar-israel-criticism/">received its own accusations of anti-Semitism</a>.</p>
      <p>Both anti-Omar responders made reference to a previous tweet in which Omar responded to Republican Kevin McCarthy who threatened to punish Omar for her opposition to the current regime in Israel by tweeting:</p>
      <p>“It’s all about the Benjamins baby."</p>
      <p>Omar was suggesting that McCarthy was threatening her due because he receives funding from the pro-Israel lobby, and that American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) purchased support from American politicians in exchange for pro-Israel positions. </p>
      <p><a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201905071074770141-usa-republicans-ilhan-omar-israel-gaza/">Omar previously tweeted</a> in 2012 that Tel Aviv had "hypnotized" the world.</p>
      <p>The allegations of anti-Semitism suggest that Omar, instead of directing class-based criticism against opponents, was insinuating that Jewish people in America hold financial sway over the US political system, a charge she has consistently denied.</p>
