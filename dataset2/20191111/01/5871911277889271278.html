      <p>NFL halftime shows are serious business, and sometimes teams really go overboard attempting to get fans fired up in between quarters of games.</p>
      <p>The Packers scheduled a pretty awesome event for halftime of Sunday’s game against the Panthers at Lambeau Field, although it didn’t really go as expected.</p>
      <p>A skydiver came flying into the stadium — which fans enjoyed watching — and he appeared to be on track or a solid landing, touching down first right around the five-yard line.</p>
      <p>However, he had a bit more speed than he had anticipated, and the skydiver ended up crashing into the wall.</p>

      <p>He was OK afterward, but yeah, he definitely overshot that landing.</p>
