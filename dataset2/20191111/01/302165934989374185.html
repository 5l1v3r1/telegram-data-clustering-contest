      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 11 — The measures the government is taking to tackle open burning in plantations and forests will be among the questions that will be raised in the Dewan Rakyat today.</p>
      <p>Another issue that will be raised at today's sitting of the Lower House which enters its 21st day, is on the steps the Communications and Multimedia Ministry is taking to curb hate speech on the Internet.</p>
      <p>According to the meeting schedule, these will be among the highlights during today's oral Question-and-Answer session.</p>
