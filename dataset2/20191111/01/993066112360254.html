      <p>DUBLINER Sue Collins and her fellow DirtBird Sinead Culbert have been making women across the world laugh for the past three years, since their Facebook sketches about the life of ordinary Irish women became a hit. Sell-out live shows followed and now they've packaged their "relatable" antics in a new book.</p>
      <p>DirtBirds' Self Help Guide, is "dedicated to all the women of Ireland who are hanging by a thread". Full of tips on how to survive the stresses and strains of modern living, advice ranges from the slightly unorthodox to the almost illegal.</p>
      <p>There's barely a situation this book won't get you out of or a difficulty its authors don't have a solution for: how to deal with your grumpy husband, for example, how to love your body even when nobody else does or how to apply your make-up when you're driving the car. Plus there's an alternative approach to surviving dry January.</p>
      <p>There are also tales about the chore of making school lunches, homework battles and the torture of trying to remove a phone from a teenager, a task they describe as being "as dangerous as removing food from a wild cheetah at feeding time".</p>
      <p>"It is very much inspired by our own personal struggles in life as a woman trying to juggle careers and parenting while having the BMI of Elle Macpherson, the a**e of Jennifer Lopez and the culinary skills of Nigella Lawson," says Collins, known to many as 'the blonde one' in The Nualas.</p>
      <p>The comedy-musical trio, formed in 1995 and, after a hiatus, successfully reborn in 2011, finally parted ways in January.</p>
      <p>"It was great to get back together and do a Take That but The Nualas had definitely run its course and it was time to move on," says Collins, who is married to actor Phelim Drew, son of Dubliner Ronnie Drew, and is mum to teenage boys Vivian (14) and Milo (13) and 11-year-old twins, Seanie and Lily.</p>
      <p>In the foreword to their book, Collins says when she isn't working she "spends all of her time making large pots of spaghetti Bolognese and driving her children around to extra curricular activities that they don't want to do".</p>
      <p>Collins admits that one of the most frustrating things she finds as a parent is trying to get her children to eat healthy food.</p>
      <p>"You spend time going around markets buying organic vegetables and corn-fed chicken and making everything from scratch, just for your kids to sit at the table and turn up their nose at it," she says.</p>
      <p>"The book is it an antidote to the perfect life that we are all supposed to be living. It's all everyday stuff; the routine that put you over the edge. What we are saying is that we are all in this together. You can sit back and have a glass of wine and a laugh and read it," says Collins, who does try to fit some mindfulness into her daily routine to stave off those endless times in the day when a mother just feels like killing someone.</p>
      <p>"Me and Sinead are advocates of the whole mindfulness movement and we do try to teach our children the benefits of taking deep breaths, though there are of course situations when no amount of deep breathing can help," she laughs.</p>
      <p>Such situations mentioned in their book include someone taking your car parking space, the self-service check-out till and crying in the cinema because "the little b*****d behind you keeps kicking the back of your seat".</p>
      <p>Dundalk-born Culbert lives in Lusk, Co Dublin, with her Dutch husband and two children Sophie (11) and Leon (7). She says her hobbies include "panicking and finding ways to avoid doing housework".</p>
      <p>"We talk about how parenting is a pain in the a**e – people don’t feel comfortable saying that because it makes them feel guilty. Parenting is very rewarding and we love our children, but it's tough," says Culbert.</p>
      <p>So how did the busy women manage to find time to pen their alternative self-help book?</p>
      <p>"As a woman you are constantly trying to balance your time. We are very lucky that we work from home. Saying that, much of it was written with the kids constantly interrupting," says Culbert.</p>
      <p>"My husband also works from home and despite the fact he was there in the kitchen, they would walk past him to where I am working, or on the phone, and go, 'Mummy, where's my runners?' or countless other questions. You're trying to explain you're doing an interview or you are writing a book, but it doesn't matter because you are mammy and you are accessible 24/7 and know where everything is.</p>
      <p>"That's why we were inspired to write the book, because as women, whether you work or not, you are generally speaking the one that keeps it all together."</p>
      <p>When it comes to helping with the dreaded homework, Culbert's advice is to "google everything".</p>
      <p>"We have a sketch about a child doing homework with her mum and she asks the mother 'How many faces are on a cylinder?' You just have to laugh at those ridiculous questions that you will never need in your future life."</p>
      <p>As Christmas fast approaches, women have yet more to juggle – from shopping, to party organising and trying to look fabulous. In order to fit into that little black dress the DirtBirds advise: "Arrange to exercise with a friend; by the time you've bitched about everyone you know, you'll have done 10 kilometres without noticing."</p>
      <p>Culbert admits she is a "lastminute.com type" of Christmas shopper, even though she risks having to search every county in Ireland for that must-have Santa gift.</p>
      <p>And her advice for surviving Christmas?</p>
      <p>"Obviously drink heavily and stay away from EastEnders omnibus – there is nothing will send you over the edge quicker than the drama on Albert Square. Waterproof mascara is also essential as Christmas is a very emotional time – it's emotional because no-one ever remembers to buy you a gift," she laughs.</p>
      <p>The DirtBirds’ Self-Help tour continues at various venues until next February. And the good news for northern fans is the ladies' promise that their next tour will be playing to audiences here.</p>
      <p>"We've a brand new show coming in March. You don't know what you will get," adds Collins.</p>
      <p>:: DirtBirds' Self-Help Guide: How to have confidence when you feel lower than a snakes a**e by Sue Collins and Sinead Culbert is published by Hachette Ireland and is available now.</p>
