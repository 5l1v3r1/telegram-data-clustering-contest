      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T01:26:25+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 01:26</time> by <a rel="author">Will Twigger, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/will-twigger/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> pro Amy Dowden has revealed she's nvited her celeb partner Karim Zeroual to her wedding amid 'curse' rumours.</p>
      <p>Amy and the CBBC presenter have wowed the judges and public alike from day one, with a string of high-scoring performances under their belt.</p>
      <p>Some fans even reckon they're destined to lift the Glitterball Trophy at the series' end, and Amy shares the same ambition for the pair.</p>
      <p>Chatting with <a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/film/2019111080377/strictly-come-dancing-amy-dowden-karim-zeroual-dream-win/">Hello!</a> magazine, the 28 year old dished about their close bond and said she wants him there on her big day.</p>
      <p>"I've made a friend for life," Amy gushed, "I see Karim as my little brother and so I want him to be there."</p>

      <p>She added that Karim's a dream student, being a naturally talented dancer.</p>
      <p>Amy said: "He's got this abundance of natural ability and star quality - it's something I could see from day one.</p>
      <p>"It's something you can't teach."</p>
      <p>Karim chimed in: "We can be honest with each other if we like the choreography or we don't. It's a friendship where we both want the exact same thing at the end of it.</p>
      <p>"She knows more about me than I know about myself!"</p>
      <p>It comes after Karim rubbished rumours of a potential romance between them saying: "I don't really know about any rumours. I'm too busy learning to do this waltz than to worry about stuff like that."</p>
      <p>The presenter has been dating university student Poppy Birtwistle for three years, while Amy is also in a relationship and preparing to tie the knot with her fiancé Ben Jones.</p>
      <p>The couple are set to tie the knot next July.</p>

      <p>They're going from strength to strength on the show, and despite Saturday's Viennese Waltz not being their strongest to date, the pair are among the favourites to win.</p>
      <p>They'll have some stiff competition from the likes of Kelvin Fletcher and Oti Mabuse, Saffron Barker and AJ Pritchard, and Michelle Visage and Giovanni Pernice.</p>
      <p>Despite being frequent leader board toppers, Michelle and Giovanni found themselves in the bottom two on Sunday's show.</p>
      <p>They managed to win out against Mike Bushell and Katya Jones, who were sent home after their fourth dance off in a row.</p>
      <p>Saffron and AJ, meanwhile, are sitting pretty at the top of the week eight leader board,  after they Waltzed their way to a near perfect score of 39 points.</p>
