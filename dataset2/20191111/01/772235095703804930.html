      <p><b>Darcy Foster • </b><b>Mercedes-Benz</b> has confirmed an electric <b>G-Class</b> is on the horizon, and says there’s a long future ahead for the long-running off-roader.</p>
      <p>Sascha Pallenberg, head of digital transformation at Daimler, last week confirmed a battery-powered version of the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz’s</a> iconic off-roader is coming on social media.</p>
      <p>Pallenberg quoted Daimler CEO Ola Kallenius, who said “there will be a zero-emission #EV version of the #MercedesBenz <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/mercedes-benz/g/">G-Class</a>”.</p>
      <p>“In the past there were discussions whether we should eliminate the model, the way I see things now I'd say the last Mercedes to be built will be a G-Class," Kallenius said.</p>

      <p>Talk of an electric (EV) Mercedes-Benz G-Wagen has been circulating since Mr. G-Class himself, Arnold Schwarzenegger, used the new model’s launch to inquire about whether an electric version was in the works.</p>
      <p>There’s no talk of when or in what form the all-electric G-Wagen will appear, but it may share internals with <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/mercedes-benz/eqc/">Mercedes-Benz's existing EQC</a> SUV.</p>
      <p>The three-pointed star’s first all-electric crossover has an <b>80kWh</b> lithium-ion battery and two electric motors outputting <b>300kW</b> and <b>760Nm.</b></p>
      <p>The current <b>G500</b> is powered by a <b>4.0-litre bi-turbo V8</b> engine making <b>310kW</b> and <b>610Nm,</b> while the <b>G400d</b> outputs <b>243kW</b> and <b>700Nm</b> from its <b>inline-six.</b></p>
      <p>Range is around <b>350km</b> on the WLTP test cycle for the EQC (below), although how that would translate to the bigger, boxier G-Wagen remains to be seen.</p>

      <p>Mercedes-Benz isn’t alone in electrifying its iconic off-roader: Ford is readying a <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/778200/ford-f-150-ev-tow/">pure-electric F-150</a>, while companies like <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/749009/rivian-electric-ute-and-suv-planned-for-australia-as-early-as-2022/">Rivian</a> are using electric power to create a new breed of off-road ready ute.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tesla/">Tesla</a> is also set to reveal its first work-focused vehicle, <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/806028/tesla-pickup-reveal-set-for-november-21/">the pickup</a>, on November 21.</p>
      <p>The idea of electrifying a G-Class might seem like blasphemy to some, but it’s been done before: Kriesel Electric has actually built a <b>plug-in 373kW G-Wagen</b> for Arnold Schwarzenegger himself.</p>
      <p>With deliveries of the G-Class in the USA almost double those of last year, the incoming electric version should boost sales in eco-conscious markets like California.</p>
      <p>It should also help the G-Class retain its status as an automotive icon long after the final drop of oil is drained out of the earth.</p>
