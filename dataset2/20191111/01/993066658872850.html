      <p>TWO people have died and a man has been injured following three separate weekend road collisions.</p>
      <p>An 88-year-old man and a pedestrian in her 40s both died in hospital following separate road collisions on Friday.</p>
      <p>Daniel Louden, from the Ballymoney area, died on Saturday night after being injured in a one-vehicle crash on the Frosses Road, Ballymoney at around 8am.</p>
      <p>The woman, whose name has not been released, was struck by a car on the Shore Road, Newtownabbey on Friday morning. It is understood she was on her way to work when she was struck close to the Northern Regional College.</p>
      <p>The police have appealed for information about both incidents.</p>
      <p>Ballymoney UUP councillor, Alderman Tom McKeown, said: "This is a terrible tragedy and our thoughts are with Mr Louden's loved ones at this incredibly difficult time."</p>
      <p>Speaking of the Shore Road incident, DUP councillor Paul Hamill said: "This has been a very difficult weekend for the woman's family, and sadly they are now dealing with bereavement. It is a tragedy for all concerned, and I'm certain the community will rally and support each other in the coming period."</p>
      <p>Police in Co Down meanwhile are appealing for information on a one-vehicle collision in which a car came off a road and crashed in a field.</p>
      <p>Officers were travelling along the Downpatrick Road outside Ballynahinch at around 10.50pm on Saturday when they came across a tree that appeared to have been knocked down.</p>
      <p>On further inspection they found a black Renault Clio car in a nearby field with an injured man inside. He was taken to hospital for treatment but his condition is not known.</p>
      <p>PSNI Inspector Brian Mills said: "I want to appeal to anyone who may have been travelling on the Downpatrick Road on Saturday between 10pm and 10:50pm and believes they may have witnessed what occurred, or captured what occurred on their dash cam to call us on 101."</p>
