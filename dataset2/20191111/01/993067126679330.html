      <p>HARDLINE republican party Saoradh has reiterated its support for Brexit.</p>
      <p>Members of the party travelled from across Ireland to attend its ard fheis in Newry in Co Down on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Chairman Brian Kenna underlined the party's continued opposition to the European Union (EU).</p>
      <p>“Saoradh support an exit from the super imperialist EU, this has been a long standing revolutionary position,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We see Brexit as a defeat for the business and political elite of Britain, Ireland and Europe.”</p>
      <p>The Dublin republican was also critical of the approach taken by other political parties who he said had "sided with the oppressor in the form of the EU, British and Irish elites against the working class".</p>
      <p>Dozens of motions were discussed by delegates while a message from republican inmates held in Maghaberry, Portlaoise and Mountjoy prisons was read to those attending.</p>
      <p>Members were also elected to sit on the party's National Executive.</p>
      <p>Mr Kenna also stated his belief that the party should select a new chair next year.</p>
