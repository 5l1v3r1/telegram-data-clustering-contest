      <p>Last year's League of Legends World Championship featured the debut of the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVZpHFXcFJw">Pop/Stars by virtual K-pop act K/DA</a>, and this year it's time for imaginary videogame hip-hop crew True Damage to have their turn, with a song and accompanying video/advertisement for new in-game skins called Giants.</p>
      <p>According to Riot, "Formed by K/DA’s rapper Akali (Soyeon of (G)I-dle), True Damage is a virtual hip-hop group that fuses the raw vocal talents of Ekko (Thutmose, Duckwrth), Senna (Keke Palmer), and Qiyana (Becky G) with Yasuo’s cutting-edge production." <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFkZjTCxVPc">The musicians and their digital apparitions performed together in augmented reality at the opening of the 2019 World Championships</a>, at the same time as the animated video debuted on YouTube. </p>
      <p>It already has well over three million views, and our Gorillaz/Hatsune Miku/NG Resonance future is one step closer to being realized.</p>
