      <h1>Google's Secret 'Project Nightingale' Gathers Personal Health Data on Millions of Americans</h1>

      <p>Google is teaming with one of the country's largest health-care systems on a secret project to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-s-secret-project-nightingale-gathers-personal-health-data-on-millions-of-americans-11573496790">collect and crunch the detailed personal health information of millions of Americans across 21 states</a>, <i>WSJ</i> reported Monday, citing people familiar with the matter and internal documents. From the report:<i> The initiative, code-named "Project Nightingale," appears to be the largest in a series of efforts by Silicon Valley giants to gain access to personal health data and establish a toehold in the massive health-care industry. Amazon.com, Apple and Microsoft are also aggressively pushing into health care, though they haven't yet struck deals of this scope. Google launched the effort last year with St. Louis-based Ascension, the country's second-largest health system. The data involved in Project Nightingale includes lab results, doctor diagnoses and hospitalization records, among other categories, and amounts to a complete health history, complete with patient names and dates of birth.</i></p>
