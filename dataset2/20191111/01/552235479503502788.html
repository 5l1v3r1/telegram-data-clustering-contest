      <h1>'Last of the few' Four humble Scots World War Two heroes captured on camera</h1>
      <h2>Photographer Wattie Cheung travelled the country to meet some of the veterans and was deeply moved by their stories.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T01:22:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 01:22</time> by <a rel="author">Jenny Morrison, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/jenny-morrison/</a></address>
      <p>Two bravely fought for their country, one worked as a ­codebreaker and another played a vital role in stopping the advance of German battleships.</p>
      <p>These courageous men and women were among a number of veterans who allowed their ­photographs to be taken as part of a project marking the everyday heroes of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/world-war-2">World War Two</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/photography">Photographer</a> Wattie Cheung, left, travelled the country capturing images that he hopes portray the humble bravery of Scots who were called upon to serve their country. And he was deeply moved by each of their stories.</p>
      <p>Wattie, 52, from Oban, said: “As a Press photographer, I have covered <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/remembrance-day">Remembrance Sunday</a> services on many occasions and always wanted to find out more about the veterans I met.</p>

      <p>“I got in touch with organisations including Poppy Scotland and the Women’s Royal Naval Service and put out an appeal on social media looking for any former servicemen and women who would be willing to be part of my project.”</p>
      <p>Wattie has taken the images of 10 veterans and hopes to work with many more before the 75th anniversary of VE Day is marked next May.</p>
      <p>He said: “To meet and ­photograph these men and women has been an honour. They did so much for their country, yet don’t in any way see themselves as heroes.”</p>
      <h3>Ailsa Stewart, 104, Campbeltown, Kintyre</h3>

      <p>Ailsa rose to the rank of second officer in the Wrens, serving at a number of Royal Naval air stations across the country including in Crail, Fife, and Machrihanish, Kintyre.</p>
      <p>Her war effort included working as an analyst during training missions.</p>
      <p>It involved the dropping of torpedoes by naval aircraft, before the planes headed on dangerous missions to attack German battleships, including the Tirpitz. It was part of the Baltic fleet, which was sunk by Royal Air Force bombers in November 1944.</p>

      <p>Her daughter-in-law, Mary Ann Stewart, said: “Ailsa will be 105 next month. She often talks about her time in the war but it’s mainly the people she met that she talks about.</p>
      <p>“When she was stationed at Machrihanish she met her husband, Ian. She has frequently travelled to Glasgow to take part in Wren reunions.”</p>
      <h3>William Glen, 97, Glasgow</h3>

      <p>D-Day veteran Bill was seriously injured days after landing on the beaches of France in June 1944.</p>
      <p>He said: “The Normandy landings were pretty rough. We were in action and fighting for two days when both of my legs were badly wounded by a mortar bomb.</p>

      <p>“I lost four of my platoon at the same time. I’d have been 23 then, but the chap next to me who died was 18.”</p>
      <p>Bill has written a book about his war memories, in which he reveals he woke up in hospital to find the man lying injured next to him was his own brother.</p>
      <h3>Jimmy Sinclair, 107, Kirkcaldy</h3>

      <p>Britain’s oldest-surviving Desert Rat refuses to wear the campaign medals he was awarded out of respect for his fallen comrades.</p>
      <p>Jimmy, who is Scotland’s oldest man, served as a gunner with the elite Chestnut Troop of the 7th Armoured Division – the Desert Rats.</p>
      <p>He fought “Desert Fox” Erwin Rommel’s Nazi troops in Egypt, took part in the Siege of Tobruk and the battles of El Alamein and Monte Cassino.</p>

      <p>He also served with the Allied Control Commission in Berlin. Jimmy struck up an unlikely friendship with Rommel’s family after meeting them at a concert in Aachen, Germany, years later.</p>
      <p>He also receives regular letters from Camilla, Duchess of Rothesay, whose father was a Desert Rat.</p>

      <p>He said: “We didn’t treat the Germans as enemies.</p>
      <p>“They were combatants in battle. Most of them didn’t want to be there either.”</p>
      <h3>Marjorie Corbett Lamb, 99, Glasgow</h3>

      <p>Marjorie was just 19 years old at the outbreak of World War Two and quickly signed up to join the Women’s Royal Naval Service – fondly known as the Wrens.</p>
      <p>She became a cipher officer and was stationed at ports ranging from Invergordon in the Highlands to Alexandria in Egypt.</p>
      <p>Her wartime role involved decoding messages from Allied ships concerning the location of German U-boats.</p>

      <p>Earlier this year, she published a book about her life during the war.</p>
      <p>Marjorie, who met her husband while stationed in Invergordon, said: “You never stop being in the Wrens. You never stop being in the Navy.”</p>
