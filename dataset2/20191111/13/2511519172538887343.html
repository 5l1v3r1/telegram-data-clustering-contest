      <h1>Arsenal: Granit Xhaka insists he is ‘100 per cent’ behind Gunners after being stripped of the captaincy</h1>

      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T13:16:19+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 13:16</time> by <a rel="author">Harry Latham-Coyle</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/granit-xhaka">Granit Xhaka</a> has said he is “100 per cent” behind <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Arsenal">Arsenal</a> despite being stripped of the captaincy at the Emirates Stadium.</p>
      <p>The Swiss midfielder has not played for the club since his outburst against <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/crystal-palace">Crystal Palace</a>.</p>
      <p>And Xhaka has now opened up on </p>
      <p>“When my shirt number lit up on the fourth official’s panel and our own fans broke into gleeful jubilation, that hit me very hard and really upset me,” Xhaka told <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11670/11859244/granit-xhaka-100-per-cent-behind-arsenal-after-crystal-palace-incident"><i>Blick.</i></a> “It was very hurtful and frustrating.</p>
      <p>“I can’t understand a reaction like that even now, especially the vehemence of it and the extreme hostility directed against me. I don’t mean to say that I can’t take criticism. If the team and I don’t play well, we must listen and work on it.</p>
      <p>“But insulting and swearing at your own captain will cause upset and a bad atmosphere for the team you are actually supposed to be supporting. That makes no sense to me and weakens the team’s spirit.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/pierre-emerick-aubameyang">Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</a> has been installed as Xhaka’s replacement as captain, with the Gunners slipping to sixth in the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/PremierLeague">Premier League</a> after defeat to Leicester this weekend.</p>
      <p>Arsenal have not won since the Xhaka incident, with <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/unai-emery">Unai Emery</a> under increasing pressure.</p>
      <p>Xhaka has revealed how his teammates attempted to support him in the wake of his outburst.</p>
      <p>“Some of my team-mates came to see me and that was great. They encouraged me to not let it get me down. Above all they pointed out how many Arsenal fans around the world didn’t like the way the fans reacted in the stadium and condemned it.</p>
      <p>“We’re talking about football and a captaincy. I know that means the world to a lot of people here in London and I’ve been 100 per cent behind the club and my role as a player since I came here. I’m proud to be playing for this big club.</p>
      <p>“I’ll continue to stay positive, give my all to an even greater extent and prove that I’m an important part of this great team.”</p>
