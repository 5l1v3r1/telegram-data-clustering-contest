      <p>LUCIO “Bong” Tan Jr., who recently took the reins of PAL Holdings Inc., passed away Monday morning, two days after collapsing at a basketball game. He was 53.<br/><br/>“His untimely passing leaves a big void in our hearts and our Group’s management team which would be very hard to fill,” his sister Vivienne K. Tan said.<br/><br/>Bong, the son and namesake of taipan Lucio C. Tan, collapsed on Saturday during a basketball game in Mandaluyong City.  <br/><br/>“Bong was a son, husband, father, friend and, most importantly, our elder brother whom we all relied on for advice, counsel and leadership,” Vivienne said.<br/><br/>He was appointed to lead PAL Holdings as president and COO on October 28.<br/><br/>Bong is survived by his wife Julie and sons Lucio Tan III and Kyle Tan.<br/><br/>“Our sincerest thanks to all who offered prayers and shared words of comfort during this hour of grief,” Vivienne said. “We ask for your prayers for the eternal repose of his soul. Wake details will be announced soon.”</p>
      <p>His death marks the second in two days among the Philippines’s taipan circle. His father Lucio Tan’s contemporary among the taipans, industrialist John Gokongwei Jr., died late Saturday night at the age of 93.</p>
