      <p>His title dream may have ended in narrow defeat, but Kane Baker’s valiant stand against talented English lightweight champ Myron Mills saw his stock soar. The heavily-tattooed Northfield warrior lost by majority decision at Villa Park on Saturday, judge Terry O’Connor unable to split the pair at 95-95.</p>
      <p>His fellow officials saw clear daylight between Derby’s Mills and his brave challenger, scoring 98-92 and 97-94. Predictably, Kane’s fans felt they’d witnessed an injustice, but I felt the right man had his hands raised and gave it the champ, who has lost only one of 15 contests, 96-94.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>In essence, it was a case of what impressed the crowd more: 23-year-old Mills’ precision and more polished work or Baker’s industry. I felt Mills landed the cleaner punches and had the last word in most exchanges.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>For Baker, not leaving the ring with the belt strapped round his waist was a blow more devastating than anything landed during 10 gruelling rounds. Yet he emerged the moral victor. The former Midlands champ, taking part in his 17th bout (six losses), showed he can more than mix it with the country’s top contenders.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>His manager, PJ Rowson, sportingly admitted Mills deserved the decision, but stressed: “I don’t get emotional about fighters, I’ve been around the game too long for that. But I’m very, very proud of Kane Baker for what he’s achieved and the way he’s turned his life around. “There is nothing not to like about the lad – he’s a credit to the sport. He doesn’t trash talk opponents and he is a pleasure to work with.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>Birmingham battler more than had his moments</h3>
      <p>Before the bout, Baker (9st 8lbs 2oz) pledged he’d make Mills work for every second of every session – and lived up to that promise. Pressing forward with gloves high in a peekaboo defence, Kane looked to bull the languid, loose-limbed champ to the ropes. Baker shrugged off flak as he pressed forward and, at times, seemed poised to drag Mills into a dogfight. In the ninth, he beckoned Mills forward, but Myron refused to be drawn into a slugging match.</p>
      <p>The Birmingham battler more than had his moments. His workrate edged the seventh and he blazed away to head and body in the 10th, Kane’s best round. Mills (9st 8lbs), however, produced the more eye-catching combinations and unleashed an eye-catching flurry at the end of sessions.</p>
      <p>He slotted home an elegant uppercut in the sixth, a cracking left hook in the seventh and a chopping right hand seemed to momentarily buzz Baker in the eighth. Even when Kane went for broke in the last, Mills remained composed, confident the result was in the bag.</p>
      <p>After the loss, Baker posted on social media: “What a night! Home happy and safe with my princess after a few rounds dancing. Great fight tonight, support was out of this world.</p>
      <p>“Lost on points in my biggest fight to date against a good boxer. Been a great couple years – won a Midlands title, fought for an English title. The long camp took a lot out of me. “After climbing some mountains I’m finally going to enjoy the view.” Baker, bruised and battle-scarred, deserves a moment to savour the scenery.</p>
