      <p>Prominent Chinese online retailers Alibaba and JD.com have reported over $55 billion worth of sales in total midway through the so called Singles’ Day – a shopping holiday popular among people in China who celebrate their single status, a sort of antithesis to Valentine’s Day.</p>
      <p>This year’s Singles’ Day, which was adopted by Alibaba as a marketing tool about a decade ago, also became the first such event for the company since Alibaba’s founder Jack Ma <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201909101076766748-alibaba-founder-jack-ma-announces-shock-resignation/">stepped down</a> in September.</p>
      <blockquote>As Alibaba kicked off the event with a concert by Taylor Swift at a Shanghai stadium on Sunday night, the company announced that sales on its platforms amounted to 205.7 billion yuan ($29.4 billion) between midnight and mid-afternoon, with JD.com reporting a slightly smaller figure, 179.4 billion yuan ($25.6 billion).</blockquote>
      <p>Despite the booming sales, however, some consumers appeared reluctant to participate in the shopping craze.</p>
      <blockquote>"I feel like the difference (in price) is not that big, and since everyone's buying all at once, the logistics and delivery are slower. I think that it's actually better for me to buy when not everyone's buying," a migrant worker in Beijing named Yang Wei explained.</blockquote>
