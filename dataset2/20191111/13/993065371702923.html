      <p>A man has been arrested over allegations of ill-treatment of patients at Muckamore Abbey Hospital.</p>
      <p>Detectives from the PSNI's Public Protection Branch arrested the man, 33, on Monday in the Antrim area.</p>
      <p>A police spokeswoman said no further information was available.</p>
      <p>Officers have been investigating thousands of incidents of alleged abuse at the Co Antrim hospital for people with mental health needs and severe learning disabilities.</p>
      <p>More than 30 staff members have been placed on precautionary suspension.</p>
      <p>Detectives have been trawling through thousands of hours of CCTV from the hospital wards.</p>
      <p>The footage has revealed alleged 1,500 crimes on one ward, police have said.</p>
      <p>A report was commissioned in September 2017, following reports of inappropriate behaviour and alleged physical abuse of patients by staff in two wards.</p>
      <p>Reviewers raised concerns about the safeguarding of adults, provision of meaningful activities for patients and physical health care.</p>
      <p>Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith previously apologised to families over the alleged abuse.</p>
