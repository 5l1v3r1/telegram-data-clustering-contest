      <h1>Celtic fans given final opportunity to make Cluj trip with just 15 seats remaining on club flight</h1>
      <h2>Neil Lennon's men travel to Romania in December in a game that could decide the group winners.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T13:23:35+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 13:23</time> by <a rel="author">Record Sport Online</a></address>
      <p>Celtic have revealed they have just 15 seats left on their chartered flight to Romania for their Europa League clash with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/cfr-cluj">CFR Cluj.</a></p>
      <p>The Hoops travel to Transylvania for the final match of their group and it could be a decider on who tops the table.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> have already qualified from Group E and Cluj are likely to follow them into the last 32, currently sitting six points ahead of Lazio in third.</p>
      <p>And supporters can be on the trip and guarantee themselves a ticket by booking one of their final 15 seats available on the flight.</p>
      <p>The day trip will see them fly from Glasgow Airport on Thursday, December 12 before returning from Romania after the match.</p>

      <p>It will cost Â£399 plus the price of your match ticket but it's perfect if you can't get enough time off work to make a longer trip.</p>
      <p>The offer is only open to season ticket holders and the club say it gives a great opportunity to build your score for future away games in Europe.</p>
      <p>The match comes four days after the Betfred Cup Final against <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> at Hampden.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon's</a> men guaranteed their place in the next round with a stunning 2-1 win over Lazio in Rome last week.</p>
      <p>James Forrest cancelled out Ciro Immobile's opening goal before Olivier Ntcham added a second late on.</p>
