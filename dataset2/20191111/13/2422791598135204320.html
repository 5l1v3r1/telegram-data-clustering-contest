      <p>BEIJING -- China's auto sales fell 5.8% from a year earlier in October as demand for electric cars plunged, extending a painful squeeze in the global industry's biggest market.</p>
      <p>An industry group, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, said Monday that drivers bought 1.9 million sedans, SUVs and minivans.</p>
      <p>Buyers are putting off big purchases amid anxiety about a cooling economy and Beijing's tariff war with Washington.</p>
      <p>Total sales, including trucks and buses, shrank 0.6% to 2.3 million.</p>
      <p>Sales of electric and gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles tumbled 45.6% to 75,000. Demand has been dampened by the end of government subsidies in mid-2019.</p>
