      <p>Creators continue to make amazing things in the PS4 game creation tool, <i>Dreams</i>. The latest creation to catch my eye is an incredible futuristic racer inspired by the popular <i>Wipeout</i> games.</p>
      <p>Project Genesis, a channel dedicated to <i>Dreams</i> creations and showcasing the best things people are making,<a href="https://youtu.be/ECRHMMwf5OU"> has some gameplay of the game.</a> <i>Slideout 3019</i>, the name of the user made game, doesn’t just include impressive on-track action, but even has menus, maps, and fantastic music. All of it looks and feels ripped right out of a proper <i>Wipeout</i> game.</p>

      <p>If you remove the <i>Dreams</i> logo from the bottom corner of the footage, I might honestly believe that this is just a teaser from an unreleased <i>Wipeout</i> sequel or remake.</p>
      <p>This impressive creation is far from the first cool thing people have made in <i>Dreams</i>. Someone is working on making <a href="http://www.kotaku.com.au/2019/05/a-dedicated-fan-is-remaking-metal-gear-solid-in-dreams"><i>Metal Gear Solid</i> in </a><a href="http://www.kotaku.com.au/2019/05/a-dedicated-fan-is-remaking-metal-gear-solid-in-dreams"><i>Dreams</i></a> and another player recreated <a href="http://www.kotaku.com.au/2019/05/someone-is-making-a-dexters-lab-video-game-in-dreams"><i>Dexter’s Laboratory</i> too.</a></p>
      <p><i>Dreams</i> is currently available in Early Access on PS4. If you have the game you can play this <i>Wipeout-</i>inspired level by searching for <i>Slideout 3019</i>. The level was created by Dreams user gauffreman.</p>
