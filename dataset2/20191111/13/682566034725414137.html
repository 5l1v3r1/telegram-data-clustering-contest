      <p>Cape Town - <b>Kaizer Chiefs</b> coach <b>Ernst Middendorp</b> says football is a physical game and that there's nothing wrong with an aggressive style of play.</p>
      <p>The German tactician spoke in response to his Orlando Pirates counterpart Rhulani Mokwena who claimed that Chiefs employed "thuggish" tactics in the Soweto derby, which Amakhosi won 3-2.</p>
      <p>Middendorp pulled no punches, stating that he isn't in the business of coaching to make friends and to take it easy against his opposition.</p>
      <p>"If you're in a game, sorry, there's nothing to talk about you having to kiss each other or go lightly (on the opponent)," said Middendorp as quoted by <a href="https://www.kickoff.com/news/articles/south-africa-news/categories/news/premiership/ernst-middendorp-refuses-to-suck-up-to-rhulani-mokwena/667214">KickOff</a>.</p>
      <p>"You do the preparations two or three days before then the 90 minutes get heated based on whatever you do intentionally or to provoke - that's something that happened.</p>
      <p>"Some coaches are taking it, and sometimes you need an hour longer or a day more to eat it and process it, but I have already a friend; I don't need another one."</p>
      <p>Chiefs are currently running away with the Absa Premiership as they enjoy a 10-point lead over second-placed Mamelodi Sundowns.</p>
