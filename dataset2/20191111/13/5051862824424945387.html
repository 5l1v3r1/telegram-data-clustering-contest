      <h1>‘Sit less, move more’ may ease hip fracture risk for postmenopausal women</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T13:48:28+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 13:48</time> by <a rel="author">David Hill-Buffalo</a></address>
      <p>Regular physical activity, including lighter intensity activities such as walking, is associated with reduced risk of hip and total fracture in postmenopausal women, according to new research.</p>
      <p>The new study, which included more than 77,000 participants in the Women’s Health Initiative, is the most comprehensive evaluation of physical activity and fracture incidence in <a href="https://www.futurity.org/older-women-physical-activity-1608282/">older women.</a></p>
      <p>Researchers followed the women for more than 14 years. During follow-up, 33% of participants reported experiencing at least one fracture.</p>
      <p>The women who did the highest amount of physical activity—approximately 35 minutes or more of daily recreational and household activities—had an 18% lower risk of <a href="https://www.futurity.org/hip-fracture-alzheimers-disease-1992192-2/">hip fracture</a> and 6% lower risk of total fracture.</p>
      <p>“These findings provide evidence that fracture reduction is among the many positive attributes of regular physical activity in older women,” says Jean Wactawski-Wende, dean of the University at Buffalo School of Public Health and Health Professions and coauthor of the paper, published in <i><a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.14084">JAMA Network Open</a></i>.</p>
      <p>“Fracture is very common in <a href="https://www.futurity.org/women-over-70-exercise-obesity-1775272/">postmenopausal women</a>, and is associated with loss of independence, physical limitations, and increased mortality,” Wactawski-Wende says.</p>
      <p>In fact, the researchers note, approximately 1.5 million fractures occur in US women each year, creating $12.7 billion in health care costs. About 14% of these fractures are in the hip. Mortality after a hip fracture is as high as 20%.</p>
      <p>“Modest activities, including <a href="https://www.futurity.org/walking-older-women-hearts-1859372/">walking</a>, can significantly reduce the risk of fracture, which can, in turn, lower the risk of death,” Wactawski-Wende says. Non-recreation physical activity, such as yard work, and household chores such as sweeping the floors or folding laundry, also inversely associated with several types of fracture.</p>
      <p>The research has important implications for public health, considering that these lighter intensity activities are common among older adults.</p>
      <p>The main message, says first author Michael LaMonte, research associate professor of epidemiology and environmental health, is “sit less, move more, and every movement counts.”</p>
