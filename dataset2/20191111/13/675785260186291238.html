      <h1>Lionel Messi promise made by Barcelona chief Josep Maria Bartomeu</h1>
      <h2>Lionel Messi scored a hat-trick, including two stunning free-kicks, as Barcelona saw off Celta Vigo 4-1 at the Nou Camp to regain top spot in La Liga</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T13:12:01+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 13:12</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu has claimed that Lionel Messi will remain with the Spanish giants for the next five years.</p>
      <p>Messi's future was thrown into doubt this season when it emerged he has a clause in his current contract which enables him to leave at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>That is despite the fact that the Argentine superstar's deal expires in 2021, with Barca chiefs desperate to tie him down to a new long-term del.</p>
      <p>And now Bartomeu has given the biggest hint yet that they are close to agreeing a new contract.</p>
      <p>“Surely it will be the wish of all parties, if he (Lionel Messi) feels strong and ambitious, to extend this contract indefinitely,” Bartomeu said.</p>

      <p>“Ultimately it is he who must decide. He has earned the right to decide when he will stop playing football. But like he said a few weeks ago, he wants to finish his playing career at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> .</p>
      <p>“Over the next two or three seasons our leader will continue to be Leo Messi. There’s no doubt that he is still young, still strong. He is still ambitious.</p>
      <p>“So Leo Messi will still play with us for the next two, three, four or five years. I have no doubts about that.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Barcelona manager Ernesto Valverde praised the perfect display of Lionel Messi after his treble, including two superb free-kicks, helped beat Celta Vigo 4-1 and put the team back top of La Liga.</p>

      <p>Real Madrid's convincing 4-0 win at Eibar earlier on Saturday had kept up the pressure.</p>
      <p>Messi gave Barca an early lead from the penalty spot, only for Celta, in their first match under new boss Oscar Garcia, to equalise through Lucas Olaza's free-kick.</p>
      <p>The Argentina playmaker, though, then produced a trademark free-kick of his own to put Barca back in front heading into half-time.</p>
      <p>Messi completed his treble - matching the record of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/cristiano-ronaldo">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> of 34 in LaLiga - when he clipped in another impeccably executed deadball strike soon after the restart.</p>

      <p>Sergio Busquets, on as a first-half substitute, crashed in a late fourth as Barcelona moved back top above <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> on goal difference.</p>
      <p>"With Leo, anything is possible," Valverde said. "This (taking free-kicks) is something that he has mastered to perfection.</p>
      <p>"Because of this, the opponent can't commit fouls on the edge of their own box. If they do, we try to take advantage.</p>
      <p>"Messi, apart from scoring goals, has a commitment to the game."</p>
