      <p>Faith Evans will appear <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGrPbTGWFJ4">on TV One’s “Uncensored”</a> Sunday — but there are some stories that did not make the cut, such as her fondest memories of her ex-husband Biggie Smalls and <a href="https://pagesix.com/tag/whitney-houston/">Whitney Houston</a>.</p>
      <p>“Whitney and Bobby [Brown] used to live in the same country club as me and my ex-husband and one day they came to our house,” Evans told us. “We were drinking wine, smoking joints, and they had this thing where they [would] dance and curse at each other.”</p>

      <p>Evans recalled that Houston “looked at me and said, ‘Faith we got to do a reality show,’ and I said, ‘Girl y’all just did the first episode right here.”</p>

      <p>She said on the subject of cannabis and Houston: “We started really hanging out when Biggie passed away. One of the first places she invited me was Donatella Versace’s house in ’97 … I was like, ‘Girl I don’t have no outfit.’ So she brought me one… It was a dinner party… and men with no shirts [were] serving platters.”</p>
