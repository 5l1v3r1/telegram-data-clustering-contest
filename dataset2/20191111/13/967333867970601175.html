      <h1>Triggered? Trump Jr. Trolled After Allegedly Being Booed by Supporters at Book Promotion Event</h1>
      <h2>In his “Triggered” book, Donald Trump Jr explains, in particular, how he has been a victim of “shadow banning”, namely, how he faced having his content blocked by other users on social media.</h2>

      <p>Donald Trump Jr’s own supporters have not thought twice before heckling the US President’s son after being informed that he did not have time to take their questions during a promotion event for his book “Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/11/donald-trump-jr-walks-out-of-triggered-book-launch-after-heckling-from-supporters">according to The Guardian</a>.</p>
      <p>Make America Great Again conservatives’ shouts of “USA! USA!” reportedly turned into louder chants of “Q and A! Q and A!,” shortly after Donald Trump J and his girlfriend Kimberly Guilfoyle appeared at the University of California’s overwhelmingly liberal Los Angeles campus on Sunday.</p>

      <p>The pair at first tried to turn a blind eye to a row which showed no sign of abating after the 450-strong audience were told that they would not be allowed to ask questions “due to time constraints.”</p>
      <p>Trump Jr then unsuccessfully attempted to assert that questions from the floor risked resulting in soundbites that can be abused and distorted by left-wing media.</p>
      <p>When his reasoning with the crowd did not work, Guilfoyle tried to lend a hand by saying,”You’re not making your parents proud by being rude and disruptive.” Moments later, the couple walked off the stage.</p>
      <p>Almost all Twitter users were ruthless toward Trump Jr, posting sarcastic tweets about what they described as a “hilarious” event.</p>

      <blockquote>“He's really proving that putting his face next to the word Triggered is a self tell, isn't  he?” one user tweeted.</blockquote>
      <p>In his book, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201911071077249770-twitter-don-trump-jr-michael-jackson/">Trump Jr. claims that he receives the highest number of death threats</a> in the country after his father, the president, and that social media have been “shadow banning” him.</p>
      <p>Trump Jr. said that Instagram pulled a post he wrote that had undermined actor Jussie Smollett’s hate-crime assault claims — later proven false — on the grounds that Trump’s comments were hate speech.</p>
