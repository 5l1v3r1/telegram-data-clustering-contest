      <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is monitoring the political situation in Bolivia and calling on civilian leadership to maintain control after President Evo Morales resigned after protests against his disputed re-election last month, a State Department official said on Monday.</p>
      <p>“It is crucial that the constitutionally delineated civilian leadership maintain control during the transition,” the official said on customary condition of anonymity.</p>
      <p>“We call on everyone to refrain from violence during this tense time and we will continue to work with our international partners to ensure that Bolivia’s democracy and constitutional order endure.”</p>
