        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 11 – Migori Governor Zachary Obado has filed an application seeking disqualification of lawyer George Wajackoyah from representing victims in the Sharon Otieno murder trial.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Obado through his lawyers Nicholas Ombija (retired judge), Kioko Kilukumi and Rogers Sagana, argued in the petition filed Monday that Wajackoyah has privileged information which he obtained from the Governor and is likely to share the same with prosecution to his disadvantage.</p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>Obado who is charged alongside his aides Michael Juma Oyamo and Caspal Obiero over the murder of Sharon, claimed Wajackoyah had visited him on December 23, last year at Gigiri Police Station where he sought to represent him.</p>
      <p>The Migori county chief said he was stunned to hear Wajackoyah put his name on record for the family of the late Sharon.</p>
      <p>Senior Counsel Fred Ngatia who is representing Oyamo said that the issue representation must be sorted out first before the hearing of the criminal case commences on December 2 and 3.</p>
      <p>The Presiding Judge – Justice Grace Ngenye – directed the matter be heard on November 27 and a determination be made before the main hearing starts.</p>
