      <p>At least 75 people died and hundreds others wounded in the Tezgam train accident on October 31. Railways officials said some of the train’s passengers were cooking breakfast around dawn when two of their gas cylinders exploded, sending flames racing through three carriages as the train passed near Rahim Yar Khan in Punjab.</p>
      <p>One of the carriages — Wagon No. 12 — was carrying mainly people from Mirpurkhas, the town’s deputy commissioner, Attaullah Shah, said. “There was never such a tragic incident to happen to Mirpurkhas.”</p>
      <p>The Ministry of Railways suspended six officers for alleged negligence in the aftermath of the Tezgam Express tragedy.</p>
