      <h1>Liverpool vs Manchester City: Jose Mourinho gives his Premier League title race verdict</h1>
      <h2>The win over Manchester City took Liverpool eight points clear at the top of the Premier League</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T13:04:04+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 13:04</time> by <a rel="author">Harry Latham-Coyle</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/JoseMourinho">Jose Mourinho</a> believes <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/LiverpoolFC">Liverpool</a> may already have won the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/PremierLeague">Premier League</a>.</p>
      <p>Speaking after <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Jurgen_Klopp">Jurgen Klopp</a>’s side moved eight points clear at the top of the table with a 3-1 victory over <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ManchesterCity">Manchester City</a>, Mourinho revealed he cannot see the Reds losing their advantage.</p>
      <p>Liverpool are yet to lose in the league this season.</p>
      <p>“If you are behind [in the title race], you have to feel like you can reach them. If you are top of the league with a big advantage, you have to feel like it is not over,” Mourinho said on <i>Sky Sports</i> after the game.</p>
      <p>But I am not there, I’m here. And here, from my position, I think it’s done unless something dramatic happens in terms of an injury situation that breaks the team.</p>
      <p>“But I think the team is a complete puzzle. I feel the way they play is adapted to the qualities of the players.</p>
      <p>“City are capable of winning seven, eight, nine matches in a row, but I can’t see how Liverpool can lose this advantage of nine points to them.”</p>
      <p>Liverpool do face a demanding run of fixtures over the next few months, with extra exertions in Qatar at the Club World Cup ill-timed in mid-December.</p>
      <p>However, the 34 points they have accrued thus far match the most earned after 12 games in English top division history.</p>
      <p>Liverpool have, of course, never won the Premier League, but finished just a point behind City last season.</p>
      <p>The pair meet again at the Etihad Stadium on April 4.</p>
