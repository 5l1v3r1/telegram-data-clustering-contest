      <p>Indian Oil Corp, the country's top refiner, is considering importing Russian oil, its chairman Sanjiv Singh said on Monday, as the company aims to diversify its oil import sources.</p>
      <p>India, the world's third-biggest oil importer and consumer, ships in about 60% of its overall crude needs from the middle eastern countries. The nation is gradually tapping new sources to hedge itself against geopolitical risks.</p>
      <p>Indian state refiners - IOC, Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd, Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd - hardly buy Russian oil as high transportation costs make the crude costly compared to the grades in Middle East.</p>
      <p>"We are exploring all options, we are discussing," Singh said, when asked if his company would sign a term contract with Russian <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/companies">companies.</a></p>
