      <p>SEPANG, Nov 11 — A Namibian man has been arrested to assist with the investigations into the discovery of a dismembered Nigerian woman’s body at an apartment in Cyberjaya last Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Sepang district police chief ACP Abdul Aziz Ali said the 26-year-old suspect was detained by a police team from the D9 Unit (Serious Crimes) of the Criminal Investigation Department on the footpath along Jalan Bukit Bintang, Kuala Lumpur, two days after the body was found.</p>
      <p>In a press conference here today, Abdul Aziz said the incident was believed to have stemmed from a fight between the suspect and the victim at the apartment before the suspect strangled the victim, believed to be his girlfriend, to death.</p>
      <p>In order to dispel the evidence, the suspect allegedly cut off both of the woman’s hands, which the police later found in a rubbish bin on the sixth floor of the same building.</p>
      <p>Abdul Aziz said the 33-year-old woman’s right leg was also found to have been almost severed.</p>
      <p>“Police also found a knife believed to have been used to maim the victim’s body,” he said, adding that the suspect also had two criminal records of trespassing and posing as a civil servant.</p>
      <p>According to him, the investigation revealed that the suspect was a former student at a private institution of higher learning in the Klang Valley, and had been expelled last year.</p>
      <p>Abdul Aziz said the suspect, who has been remanded for seven days beginning Nov 9, was believed to have befriended the victim via social media. — Bernama</p>
