      <h1>Selena Gomez Looked Straight Out of a Teen Movie for Julia Michaels' '90s Prom Party</h1>

      <p>You no longer have to imagine what the '90s version of Selena Gomez would look like. Gomez channeled the decade last night deliberately for Julia Michaels' '90s prom birthday party, and it's wild how much the hair and makeup transformed her face. "90s night," she captioned the Instagram Story shot of herself with the glam.</p>

      <p>Combine that hair and makeup with Gomez's black dress, and Gomez looked straight out of a teen film at the party. Raquelle Stevens shared a great shot of them posing there:</p>

      <p>Gomez is actually friends with Rachel Green IRL and <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29746868/selena-gomez-jennifer-aniston-makeup-free-instagram-comment/">made headlines this weekend</a> for showing <i>Friends </i>actress Jennifer Aniston her support online. Aniston shared a makeup-free Instagram to her account, and Gomez commented adoringly, "Queen!"</p>

      <p>Gomez has been more active on social media period since she released her first two comeback singles <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/music/a29553902/selena-gomez-lose-you-to-love-me-lyrics-meaning-justin-bieber/">"Lose You to Love Me"</a> and <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/music/a29572428/selena-gomez-look-at-her-now-lyrics-meaning-justin-bieber/">"Look at Her Now."</a> The singer was in a particularly celebratory mode last week when "Lose You to Love Me" became <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29687645/selena-gomez-lose-you-to-love-me-hot-100-reaction/">her first-ever #1 son</a>g on the Billboard Hot 100.</p>
      <p>"My first number 1!! This song is so dear to my heart," Gomez captioned her Instagram marking the achievement. "I’ve been working so hard to make this album as honest and fun as possible while remaining vulnerable enough to share where I am in life. I love you deeply and thank you so much for listening. I want to thank each and every person that was apart of this moment that I’ll never forget!"</p>
