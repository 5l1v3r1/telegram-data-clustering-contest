      <p>Cape Town - A fan is suing Madonna for moving her concerts to a later time – and the singer isn’t having any of it!</p>
      <p>When the Like a Virgin singer changed her concert times in Miami from 8.30pm to 10.30pm, her fans weren’t happy about it, <a href="https://www.complex.com/music/2019/11/madonna-hit-with-lawsuit-for-changing-start-time-of-an-upcoming-concert"><b>Complex</b></a> reports.</p>
      <p>So much so that superfan Nate Hollander filed a class-action lawsuit against the 61-year-old for pushing back her Madame X Tour concert times.</p>
      <p>Court documents showed that Nate paid $1 024,95 (around R15 300) for three tickets.</p>
      <p>"Ticketholders [have] to work and go to school the next day, which prevent[s] them from attending a concert that would end at around 1am," the suit states, according to documents obtained by <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katienotopoulos/fan-suing-madonna-concerts-late"><b>BuzzFeed</b></a>.</p>
      <p>"Due to the change in the start times all tickets purchased by Hollander and all class members suffered an extreme loss in value, making it impossible for Hollander and all class members to recover the amount paid for said tickets by reselling them."</p>
      <p>Nate is also reportedly suing Live Nation, the events firm that planned the concert.</p>
      <p>This past weekend Madonna addressed her "tardiness" with fans during her concert, <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/11/10/fan-sues-madonna-saying-her-concert-starts-too-late/"><b>Page Six</b></a> reveals.</p>
      <p>“Here's something that you all need to understand. And that is that a queen is never late,” she said.</p>
