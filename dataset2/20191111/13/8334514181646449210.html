      <p>MADRID (Reuters) - The European Union’s incoming foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said on Monday that Bolivia’s Oct. 20 election results could not be validated, citing a report that pointed to various failures amounting to more than just “simple irregularities.”</p>
      <p>Violent clashes erupted in the Bolivian capital of La Paz after Evo Morales, the country’s president since 2006, resigned on Sunday under pressure over a disputed election last month.</p>
      <p>A report from the Organization of American States (OAS) released early on Sunday said the Oct. 20 election should be annulled and a new vote held after it had found “clear manipulations” of the voting system that called into question the win by Morales.</p>
