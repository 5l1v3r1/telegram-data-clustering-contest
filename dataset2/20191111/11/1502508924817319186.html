      <p>Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp will spend about 600 billion yen ($5.5 billion) to build power distribution networks, the Nikkei newspaper reported, without citing its sources.</p>
      <p>In a rare move for non-power generators, Japan's former telephone monopoly aims to supply power to hospitals and factories when electricity supply is cut off, the report said.</p>
      <p>NTT generates about 300 billion yen in revenue from its power business and plans to double that by fiscal 2025, the report said.</p>
      <p>NTT will provide electricity by using power saved in batteries at the 7,300 buildings it owns and will purchase power from others, the report said.</p>
      <p>It also plans to build solar, wind and biomass power generators.</p>
      <p>NTT's own networks could reduce the risk of blackouts, the report said.</p>
      <p>In September Tokyo Electric Power was slow to restore service after Typhoon Faxai hit Tokyo and surrounding regions and left more than 800,000 households without power.</p>
