      <h3>TWO Filipino seafarers  were abducted in Togo, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) yesterday said.</h3>
      <p>The latest kidnapping incident was reported by the Philippine Embassy in Abuja, Foreign Affairs Assistant Secretary Eduardo Meñez said.</p>
      <p>“We received a report of another piracy incident in West Africa that resulted in the kidnapping of two more Filipino seafarers somewhere in Togo,” the DFA said.</p>
      <p>The latest incident brought to 11 the total number of kidnapped Filipino seafarers in West Africa.</p>
      <p>Last week, nine Filipino sailors were reported abducted by pirates from a cargo ship off the coast of Beni in West Africa.</p>
      <p>Shipowner JJ Ugland said pirates boarded anchored vessel MV Bonita early morning of Nov. 2 off Cotonou, Benin in the Gulf of Guinea while waiting for berth to discharge inbound gypsum cargo.</p>
      <p>The Philippine government is  monitoring the development of the case with the embassy in Abuja and coordinating with authorities to ensure the safety and security of the Filipino seafarers. </p>
      <p>Moreover, the DFA maintains close contact with the seafarers’ manning agency and will provide updates, as necessary.</p>
