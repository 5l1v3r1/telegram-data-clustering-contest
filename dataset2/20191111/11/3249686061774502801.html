      <p><b>YG Entertainment</b> published a press release stating <b>Blackpink</b> won in 3 categories at<b> E! People's Choice Awards.</b></p>
      <p>The title of the press release said, <i>"Blackpink Won in 3 categories at E!People's Choice Awards - Group of 2019, The Music Video of 2019 and The Concert tour of 2019."</i></p>
      <p>However, YG had published the press release <i>before </i>E! People's Choice Awards announced the result. Then YG Entertainment changed the title from <i>"Blackpink Won in 3 categories"</i> to <i>"Blackpink is nominated in 3 categories..."</i> However a lot of people saw the article and K-Media already started to write about it.</p>

      <p>K-media has also criticized YG for media playing Blackpink's dome tour concert attendance numbers. They stated, <i>"YG also issued a press release on Blackpink's Japan Tokyo Dome tour and stated, 'Blackpink is expected to mobilize a total of 205,000 spectators through 3 dome concerts.' However, even <b>TVXQ, BTS </b>and <b>TWICE </b>were never close to mobilizing 200,000 spectators through 3 dome concerts."</i></p>
