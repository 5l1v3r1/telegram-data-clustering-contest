      <h2>Liverpool's opening goal was checked by VAR after Trent Alexander-Arnold handled the ball in the build-up, but his arm was adjudged to be in a natural position</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T11:55:37+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 11:55</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Virgil van Dijk says he didn't celebrate Liverpool's opener against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> because he was worried VAR was going to rule it out.</p>
      <p>Trent Alexander-Arnold handled the ball in the Reds box, around 20 seconds before <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> hit City on the break and opened the scoring through Fabinho.</p>
      <p>The Man City players surrounded referee Mike Riley and VAR checked to see if the Liverpool right-back had indeed touched the ball.</p>
      <p>He had, which he even later admitted, but it was deemed that his arm was not in an unnatural position, meaning the goal stood and no penalty was awarded.</p>
      <p>Explaining how this incident impacted his reaction to the opener, Van Dijk told Sky Sports: "Every goal you know now you have to wait anyway, so I wasn't even celebrating I think.</p>

      <p>"But in the end the VAR gives it so you have to just keep carrying on, you can't change it anymore. I think I saw Bernardo Silva hitting it first [with his hand] and maybe Trent hit it as well.</p>
      <p>"What can I say? I can say a lot of things, but if the VAR gives it then you have to accept it."</p>
      <p>He added: "We all know and we all feel that there's so many games left, so many things can happen between now and mid-May.</p>
      <p>"So the only thing we can do is hopefully stay fit, all of us, we need everyone, and play as well as we can.</p>

      <p>"Obviously we're very happy with the position we're in right now, but we shouldn't take it for granted â€“ and we won't. But we have to just keep going and take it game by game."</p>
      <p>Pep Guardiola was furious that play wasn't brought back and a penalty awarded, and was animated on the touchline as he confronted the match officials.</p>
      <p>After the game he was asked for his opinions on the incident, but bit his tongue.</p>

      <p>"Ask the referees, don't ask me. Ask Mike Riley and the guys in VAR. Don't ask me, we tried to do our job," said Guardiola. "I would like to talk about our performance, it was so good.</p>
      <p>"I know the way teams play when they come here and have so much respect for Anfield, and with the problems we had in the squad, the way we played was awesome. It was one of the best performances we have played."</p>
