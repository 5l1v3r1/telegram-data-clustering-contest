      <p>BONITA SPRINGS, Fla. -- From the battlefield to the ball field. Sunday, the Louisville Sluggers, a national amputee baseball-softball team, played in the First Responders Warriors Cup in Bonita Springs.</p>
      <p>The Sluggers played against the city's first responders, which included members from the Lee County Sheriff's Office and Bonita Springs Fire Control and Rescue District.</p>
      <p>The Slugger team consists of military veterans, active duty personnel, wounded warriors...and amputee college baseball players. They say playing tonight was very special for many reasons.</p>
      <p>Each athlete has a unique story. They've either suffered a loss of a limb, a partial limb...or eye. Or they have other prostheses because of congenital, disease, or trauma-related reasons.</p>
