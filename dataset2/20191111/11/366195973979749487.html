      <p><a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/troyave/profile">Troy Ave</a> has taken flak during his tenure in the game, but damned if he isn't still here, still hustling. Today, the New York native has arrived with a brand new single, this time linking up with The Wave himself, Max B. While that in itself is a good look for fans of the incarcerated rapper, the aptly titled "Troy Ave &amp; Max B" is a strong melodic offering from both parties. The song opens with a melancholic string arrangement, one that sets an immediately emotional tone. Max asserts his presence with a smooth melody, one that reflects on his ongoing trials and tribulations.</p>
      <p>Troy Ave follows suit, himself no stranger to adversity. Turning in his most vulnerable performance in recent memory, Troy allows himself space for heartfelt honesty, alternating between a sung and rapped cadence. In truth, this may be one of his best verses in a minute, if not his most passionate. At over five minutes, "Troy Ave &amp; Max B" is a slow-burning and intense affair, one that packs more substance than the average street single. Be sure to check this one out now, and sound off below - are you eagerly anticipating the return of the wave?</p>

      <p>I stay with the toaster, Louis V shoes be my loafers<br/>Riding on opps like a chauffer, gun off the holster<br/>I done felt death getting closer, war in the streets in a soldier</p>
