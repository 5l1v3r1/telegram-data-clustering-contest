      <p>LEE COUNTY, Fla. -- We have an update on a very special friend of Fox 4!</p>
      <p>You might remember Kelly Collins. A couple weeks ago, her mom asked Fox 4 anchor Patrick Nolan to send her a card as she got ready to travel to Tampa for heart surgery.</p>
      <p>Well, Patrick surprised her with a visit to her home.</p>
      <p>Now we're happy to report that Kelly says she's feeling better after the surgery. She's even been able to get up on her feet.</p>
      <p>And one of her teachers in Fort Myers even made the trip to Tampa to visit her in the hospital.</p>
      <p>Kelly tells us she hopes to be home this weekend.</p>
