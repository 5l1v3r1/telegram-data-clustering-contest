      <p>Johannesburg – Speaking to <b>Channel24</b> from his hospital bed on Monday morning, actor Patrick Shai said that he had been wounded after being struck by 11 rubber bullets during a protest in Dobsonville.  </p>
      <p>The community in the south of Johannesburg has been protesting due to electricity cuts. </p>
      <p>Patrick says he stood between disgruntled residents and police, trying to calm the situation when he was shot.</p>
      <p>"I was trying to mediate between cops and residents."</p>
      <p>About his injuries, he says: "I've got an open wound on my leg. They're putting in a drip now." He added that he was going to have x-rays done to determine if he had incurred any other structural damage to tissue or bone. </p>

      <p>The former <i>Generations</i> and <i>Zone 14</i> actor said that while his thigh was left wounded, most of the rubber bullets hit him the back when he was trying to get away. </p>
      <p>"When we say that there is no need for violence, we are also saying that to police," Shai says, calling cops on the scene "trigger happy". </p>
      <p>The star who resides in Dobsonville says that his area had not been affected by power cuts, but he decided to join protests anyway as a means of keeping the peace among residence and police. </p>
      <p><b>UPDATE</b>: A statement sent to <b>Channel24</b> from South African Police Services' Brigadier Mathapelo Peters confirms that police had fired rubber bullets "to disperse a group of about 200 protesters", saying that protesters had allegedly "started pelting the police while the JMPD were clearing the debris on the barricaded Elias Motswaledi Road."</p>
      <p>According to the statement, no arrests have been made. Police will remain in the area to "ensure no further violence erupts."</p>
