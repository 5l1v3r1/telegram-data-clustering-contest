      <h1>His Dark Materials fans shocked as episode 2 makes major book changes</h1>
      <h2>Episode 2 of His Dark Materials, entitled The Idea of North, saw a major adaptational change from Philip Pullman's novels</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T11:55:19+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 11:55</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Knight, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/lewis-knight/</a></address>
      <p>The second episode of the new BBC fantasy series saw some huge adaptational changes.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/his-dark-materials">His Dark Materials</a> diverged from the events of the book Northern Lights by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/philip-pullman">Philip Pullman</a> in multiple ways in its second outing, entitled The Idea of North.</p>
      <p>One of the major changes saw our heroine Lyra Belacqua (Dafne Keen) discover from her sinister new guardian Mrs Coulter ( <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/ruth-wilson">Ruth Wilson</a> ) that Lord Asriel ( <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/james-mcavoy">James McAvoy</a> ) is not her uncle, but is actually her father.</p>
      <p>The reveal of Lyra's paternity doesn't take place until towards the end of the novel, so to get this out of the way early is a big change.</p>
      <p>However, the biggest departure from the books is the introduction of our own world so early, as we see Lord Carlo Boreal (Ariyon Bakare) walk through a gateway in the old ruins at Jordan College in the Oxford of Lyra's world and steps into the Oxford of our world.</p>

      <p>The series has already expanded on Lord Boreal's role in the first novel Northern Lights, where he plays a minor part as an associate of Mrs Coulter, while we also don't get any introduction to our world until the second novel The Subtle Knife, where Boreal plays a major role.</p>
      <p>Clearly, this change will lay the groundwork for future plot lines, but it also makes Lord Asriel's journey to the North to open a door to other worlds a bit less epic.</p>
      <p>Regardless, His Dark Materials fans had a few thoughts on the major adaptational changes and shared them on social media.</p>

      <p>One pleased fan wrote on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> : "His Dark Materials ep. 2 was PERFECT. Spot on. Building up everything that needs to be build up to tell the three books as a whole. It always felt weird to me when Lord Boreal suddenly shows up out of anywhere in book Two, so introducing him this way and so early, is necessary."</p>
      <p>Another fan was cautious: "Little confused with the Lord Boreal scenes in <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23HisDarkMaterials">#HisDarkMaterials</a> Hopefully this is just fluff for next series."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, one fan was less keen: "Now why the f**k are they having Boreal cross into Will’s world and investigate Grumman in the second episode of s1 if they’re doing book 2 stuff now tf are they gon do for s2 I- <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23HisDarkMaterials">#HisDarkMaterials</a> "</p>
      <p>While on the Lord Asriel reveal, one wrote: "Second episode of <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23HisDarkMaterials">#HisDarkMaterials</a> was funky. I'm loving the accuracy of everything, though I feel like the Lord Asriel bombshell maybe came a little too soon (iirc it's much later in the books). Still, it's a fantastic show, literally just like rereading the books."</p>
      <p>Finally, one wrote: "Not sure I like the book hopping. Mrs C dropping the Asriel bomb though. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23HisDarkMaterials">#HisDarkMaterials</a> "</p>
      <p>Well, next week certainly looks to be in an interesting place!</p>
