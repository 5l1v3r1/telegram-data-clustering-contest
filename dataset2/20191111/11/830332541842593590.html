      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T11:40:37+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 11:40</time> by <a rel="author">Christina Maxouris, CNN</a></address>
      <p>NEW YORK - A shining light, a distinct talent, a loving person. That's how Laurel Griggs, the 13-year-old actress who died last week, is being remembered.</p>
      <p>Laurel battled asthma for about two years, her father Andrew Griggs told CNN. Last Tuesday, Griggs suffered an asthma attack and within two hours, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/10/entertainment/laurel-griggs-broadway-actress-dead-obituary-trnd/index.html">went into cardiac arrest and died.</a></p>
      <p>More than 1,000 attended her funeral, her father said, and hundreds more paid their respects online.</p>
      <p>"Laurel was a brilliant young lady whose impact in the lives of everyone she met went far beyond her immense talent," the outlet Young Broadway Actor News <a href="http://youngbway.org/2019/11/laurel/">said</a>. "Her wisdom and kindness were gifts to the theatre community during her time on Earth."</p>
      <p>The outlet also shared some of the star's career highlights through pictures and videos.</p>
      <p>Laurel made her Broadway debut at 6 years old in "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof," performing alongside Scarlett Johansson. In 2013, she performed in the Tony award-winning musical "Once" as the alternate for the role of Ivanka. In 2015, she ended her 17-month run with "Once" and transitioned her career toward TV and film.</p>
      <p>The production of "Once" <a href="https://www.facebook.com/OnceMusical/posts/2473152476094310?__xts__[0]=68.ARDD_s86f8aRZK6q-ZlTfwyxdwEzFgRIgM_Zffr_kcZoyYR31-HpyFM9Y9XLBqSL_fUHWDKovjcBCtmBKtVNsKZjCUpwcVm3Lvt5tyW6ZSyERUoAXH6GtukTrP68IvvLKFYNs59WchD9-JcdRxw8lFeCu2RB-ErOKi0-uxiojkGItSptgePGH1Sv_Y3Q6dFjOWZ0qKSVA98Xphcdp0RIY4z2qKyC8hlq7pz3il2MDSgUeKWB8LIREkE-rWc78L6Rx_BicgJpwKvk427rlHzKP64JDx78mCENQGjWNKxD34UqAToAzMB5QGgmNFzfEe454aVMLlvBmzvT3q4uzRGxcOh-dA&amp;__tn__=-R">wrote on their Facebook page</a>: "This beautiful young lady was part of our Once family. Please keep her family in your prayers."</p>
      <p>Eliza Holland Madore, who was cast as Ivanka in the Broadway show, said she was "deeply saddened by the sudden loss of one of my Ivanka sisters."</p>
      <p>"Laurel- you were always smiling and always made other people laugh," she wrote in an<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4nETL2H4pF/"> Instagram post.</a> "I'm so incredibly grateful that I got to know you. You will never be forgotten and we will never stop loving you."</p>
      <p>In the past few years, Laurel was featured in several commercials and shows. She landed a role in Woody Allen's 2016 film "Caf√© Society" and also appeared on <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/10/entertainment/laurel-griggs-broadway-actress-dead-obituary-trnd/index.html">two episodes of "Saturday Night Live."</a></p>
      <p>In a page <a href="https://www.dignitymemorial.com/obituaries/new-york-ny/laurel-griggs-8917364">dedicated to the star</a>, notes of support and admiration flooded in.</p>
      <p>"I had the distinct pleasure of getting to direct Laurel in two plays last year at her school," a user by the name of Jessica Threet wrote. "I could tellshe had something special to give the world. She had such a bright light shining from her."</p>
      <p>"She was kind to everyone, hard working, and just a pleasure to be around."</p>
      <p>Another person, Lola Horowitz, wrote: "I met Laurel at our theater school, and we became very good friends. I instantly knew that she was one of the most kindest persons I've ever met."</p>
      <p>"I loved running into her at auditions -- she was sweet and a true ray of light," Echo Picone wrote. "I wish I got to know her better, but her spirit was bright enough to stay in my memory."</p>
      <p>CNN's Elizabeth Wolfe, Monica Haider and Melissa Gray contributed to this report.</p>
