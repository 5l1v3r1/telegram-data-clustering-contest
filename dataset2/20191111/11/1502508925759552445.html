      <h2>Concern over trade war, oversupply persists; China car sales fall again</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/oil-prices">Oil prices </a>dipped on Monday after US President Donald Trump appeared to play down reports of an imminent lifting of tariffs in a protracted US-Chinese <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/trade-war">trade war.</a></p>
      <p>Brent crude was down 48 cents at $62.03 by 1311 GMT. The contract gained 1.3% last week.</p>
      <p>US crude was 59 cents lower at $56.65 a barrel, having risen 1.9% last week.</p>
      <p>Trump said on Saturday that trade talks with China were moving along "very nicely" but the United States would only make a deal if it was the right one for America.</p>
      <p>Trump also said there had been incorrect reporting about US willingness to lift tariffs as part of a "phase one" agreement, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/markets-news-1060101.htm">news </a>of which had boosted <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/markets">markets.</a></p>
      <p>The 16-month <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/trade-war">trade war </a>between the world's two biggest economies has slowed economic growth around the world and prompted analysts to lower forecasts for oil demand, raising concerns that a supply glut could develop in 2020.</p>
      <p>"We expect the sideward trading to continue for the time being, with the trade conflict headlines likely to dictate the direction," Commerzbank said in a note.</p>
      <p>Oil futures often trade in tandem with shares. Equities across the globe fell on Monday on escalating violence in Hong Kong. Asian stocks had their worst day since August.</p>
      <p>Underlining the impact of the trade war, data over the weekend showed that China's producer prices fell the most in more than three years in October.</p>
      <p>Auto sales in China fell for a 16th consecutive month in October, data showed on Monday.</p>
      <p>Investors are also concerned about excess supplies of crude, analysts said.</p>
      <p>The oil market outlook for next year may have upside potential, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/opec">OPEC </a>Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said last week, suggesting there is no need to cut output further.</p>
      <p>The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies led by Russia meet in early December. The so-called OPEC+ alliance has since January cut output by 1.2 million barrels per day under a deal set to last until March 2020.</p>
      <p>Lukoil, Russia's second biggest oil producer, expects the global oil production cut deal to be extended, its chief said on Monday.</p>
      <p>This was echoed by Oman, while the United Arab Emirates said it was not worried about long-term growth in oil demand.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile in North America, TC Energy Corp's 590,000-barrel-per-day Keystone oil pipeline has returned to service, operating at reduced pressure with a gradual increase of volumes.</p>
