      <p>According to recent reports, <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/boe">BOE</a> has started mass production of Micro OLED panels in Kunming, Yunnan Province in October this year. Now, the Chinese display maker needs a partner in Micro OLED applications. In May, BOE demonstrated its innovative technology and solutions such as the 0.39-inch Micro-OLED AR with the highest 5644 PPI. There are also reports that the current Micro OLED panel is mainly used in telescopes. However, BOE is now using it for AR/VR glasses, first-person view angle (FPV) goggles and projectors for drones.</p>

      <p>Since BOE got the patronage of Huawei with the Mate 20 series, its fortunes seem to be increasing. The likes of Apple and LG have both showed interest in its display and its revenue fr H1 2019 hit $8 billion. According to BOE’s H1 2019 financial report, its 6th generation flexible AMOLED production line in Chengdu increased by more than 300% year-on-year. This is a new high for the production line.</p>
      <p>According to IHS Markit data, BOE’s overall display shipment is top globally, with shipments up 23% year-on-year. As of now, virtually all devices with a display requires an OLED panel. Flexible OLED panels for smartphones account for the second-largest market share in the world. If Apple joins BOE’s customer list, its revenue will probably increase next year.</p>
