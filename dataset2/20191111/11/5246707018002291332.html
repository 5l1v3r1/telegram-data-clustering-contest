      <p>Nintendo's Wii is now 13 years old, has had two console successors in the form of the Wii U and Switch, and has even had its <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/01/so_long_wii_shop_channel_and_thanks_for_all_the_games">online store entirely closed down</a>. Despite all of this, Ubisoft decided to release its latest party hit <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/just_dance_2020"><b>Just Dance 2020</b></a> on the machine, and it's very clear to see why.</p>
      <p>The game launched worldwide last week on Wii, as well as for the trio of current systems - Switch, PS4 and Xbox One. The <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/uk_charts_luigis_mansion_3_falls_to_fourth_as_death_stranding_and_call_of_duty_take_command">most recent UK gaming charts</a> have revealed that the game has debuted in 15th place in the country's all-formats chart, and the Switch version was comfortably the most popular of the bunch, generating 55% of those sales.</p>
      <p>That's obviously a positive statistic for Nintendo, but it gets even better. It turns out that the Wii version accounted for 21% of the game's opening week sales, with the PS4 and Xbox versions lagging behind on 14% and 10% respectively. Ubisoft recently explained its decision to release the game on Nintendo's ageing console, noting that <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/06/ubisoft_is_still_releasing_just_dance_on_wii_because_the_audience_wants_it">the demand was still there</a> from fans. It was right.</p>
