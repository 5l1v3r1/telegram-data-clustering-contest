      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T11:51:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 11:51</time> by <a rel="author">https://www.facebook.com/dunyanews</a></address>
      <p>ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – The National Assembly (NA) is likely to hold voting on the no-confidence motion, tabled against Deputy Speaker Qasim Suri, this week, Dunya News reported on Monday.</p>
      <p>The voting will presumably be held on Thursday or Friday. It is pertinent here to mention that the opposition possesses support of 155 parliamentarians whereas the government and its allies comprise 184 members. Secret balloting will be held.</p>
      <p>Let it be known that the opposition had on Friday tabled no-confidence motion against Qasim Suri under Rule 12 (removal of the speaker or the deputy speaker) of the Rules and Procedure and Conduct of Business, 2007 and Article 53(7)(c) of the Constitution.</p>
      <p>The motion was moved by Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leaders Khawaja Asif, Khurram Dastagir, Mohsin Nawaz Ranjha, Murtaza Javed Abbasi, and Muhammad Sajjad, day after deputy speaker passed 11 ordinances in haste that no time was given to assembly members for proper debate on them.</p>
      <p>The resolution said that Qasim Suri violated the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business and lost the confidence of NA majority. The deputy speaker was accused of biased behavior.</p>
      <p>The Article 53(7)(c) of the Constitution states, "The office of Speaker or Deputy Speaker shall become vacant if he is removed from office by a resolution of the Assembly, of which not less than seven days notice has been given and which is passed by the votes of the majority of the total membership of the Assembly." </p>
