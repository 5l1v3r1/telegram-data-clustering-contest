      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/ozzy-osbourne">Ozzy Osbourne</a> has announced details of his rescheduled UK and European tour dates, after health issues forced him to postpone the shows for the second time.</p>
      <p>The rock icon was forced to shelve arena dates in February 2020 as he continues to recover from surgery he required after <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/ozzy-osbourne-postpones-tour-dates-suffering-fall-2471491">suffering a fall in his LA home in January</a>. The injury and subsequent surgery had already <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/ozzy-osbourne-announces-rescheduled-farewell-tour-dates-for-2020-2482025">forced Osbourne to reschedule all of his 2019 live dates on the No More Tours 2 Tour</a>.</p>
      <p>Now, it’s been confirmed that he’ll return to the road in October 2020 for a string of UK arena shows.</p>

      <p>“I can’t wait to get off my ass and get going again, but you’re just going to have to be a bit more patient. I want to be 100% ready to come out and knock your fucking socks off,” said Osbourne.</p>
      <p>“I’m not retiring, I’ve still got gigs to do and also there’s a new album on the way. To the fans, I sincerely thank you for your patience, your loyalty, I love you.”</p>
      <p>Original tickets for the shows remain valid and you can check out the new dates in full below.</p>
      <p><b>OCTOBER 2020</b><br/>23, Utilita Arena, Newcastle<br/>25, The SSE Hydro, Glasgow<br/>28, The O2, London<br/>31, Resorts World Arena, Birmingham</p>
      <p><b>NOVEMBER 2020<br/></b>2, Manchester Arena, Manchester<br/>8, Nottingham Motorpoint Arena, Nottingham</p>
      <p>Judas Priest remain as support, with frontman Rob Halford commenting: “We are very grateful for the rock solid support from our wonderful UK &amp; European fans as Ozzy gets well and strong.</p>
      <p>“The UK/European tour will showcase the very best British Metal from the ones that started it all and we proudly look forward to celebrating our 50 Heavy Metal Years together with you!”</p>

      <p>Last month, Osbourne updated his fans in a new video which saw him describing his injuries as “this fucking neck thing” and explains that the fall saw him “screw all the vertebrae in my neck”.</p>
      <p>“I’ve got more nuts and bolts in my neck now than my car,” Osbourne says in the clip. “I’m not dying, I am recovering: it’s just taking a little bit longer than everyone thought it would.”</p>
      <p>He also confirmed that a new album “is on the way” – <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/ozzy-osbourne-recording-new-music-while-recovering-from-surgery-2540865">a subject he recently discussed back in August.</a></p>
