      <p>Samsung Galaxy W20 with foldable design clears TENAA ahead of launch<br/>3 (60%) 2 votes</p>
      <p>The Samsung Galaxy W20 that <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/10/31/galaxy-w20-5g-foldable-clamshell-smartphone-is-coming-on-november/">we have heard about for some time now</a> has just passed a prerelease test in China. Thought to be a clamshell smartphone, recent reports suggest that the Galaxy W20 may in fact be Samsung’s second foldable smartphone.</p>
      <p>The device which is set to be announced at a launch event on November 19 in Wuhan, China has now appeared on <a href="http://www.tenaa.com.cn/">TENAA</a>, complete with images, and a brief specs list. It gets the model number SM-W2020, with a design similar to the first Galaxy Fold announced in China a while ago.</p>

      <p>TENAA hasn’t given us a view of the W20 when unfolded, but there are a couple of images that reveal the design from both sides. First off, the images reveal that the device has a hinge on the right edge; while other controls like the volume rocker, fingerprint scanner, and power button sit on the left. The device as per the listing measures 160.9 x 117.9 x 6.9mm – the same as the Galaxy Fold. The controls, as well as the footprint all line up with that of the Galaxy Fold, fueling speculations the W20, may, in fact, be a 5G only variant of the Fold.</p>

      <p>Looking at one of the images, the Galaxy W20 has a vertically aligned triple rear cameras, with a LED flash, and an unknown sensor beside it. We do not have the full specs detail at the moment, however, the listing says the W20 will come with a compact 4.6-inch cover display and 4,135mAh battery instead of 4,380mAh battery cell on the Galaxy Fold.</p>
      <p>The device could come with the latest Exynos 990 chip with its integrated 5G modem.
