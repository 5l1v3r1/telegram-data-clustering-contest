      <h1>Ask these 5 questions to your ageing parents to keep them healthy and safe</h1>

      <p>At some point or other in our lives, our roles get swapped with our parents. As heartbreaking as it is to look after the people that have taken care of you their whole lives, sadly, it is inevitable. They become prone to falling ill as their immune system becomes weaker. Sometimes this role-reversal happens gradually, other times it comes knocking in the form of an ambulance.</p>
      <p>This is why it becomes crucial to identify and prepare yourself accordingly to care of your parents in their sunset years. Here are five simple questions you need to ask your ageing parents to chart out a plan.</p>
      <p>
        <b>1. What are their living arrangements?</b>
      </p>
      <p>One of the first things you need to get in order is your parents’ living arrangements. Do they feel comfortable living alone or do they require assistance? How do they feel about moving in with you (or your siblings) or do they want a 24 into 7 assistance at home? This question is important because from shopping for groceries to emotional support, you need to have a plan for your parents and understand your duties as a caregiver.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2. Do they need extra help?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Pay attention to the symptoms to understand whether your parents require extra care. If they are forgetting to turn off the gas stove, a little too often and are missing important medications, it might be time to make a decision about whether your parents can be left alone at home or not. You can also look into full-time assistance and suggest shifting near them for extra help.</p>
      <p>
        <b>3. Should they be driving?</b>
      </p>
      <p>When parents grow old, getting their freedom snatched might be one of their most dreaded fears. So, it is important to be sensitive when you are discussing whether they should stop driving or not. It not only impacts their self-esteem but it may also take away their sense of independence. From slow reflexes to vision and other health issues, driving may not be exactly safe for them at this point of time. You may also need to bring to attention to medical conditions that could be affecting their driving skills.</p>
      <p>
        <b>4. What medicines are they taking?</b>
      </p>
      <p>As a caregiver, it is important to keep a list of medications your parents are taking and do a follow-up with their medical care provider to understand whether they are up-to-date or not.</p>
      <p>Check for the effectiveness of the medications and help them manage them in a better manner. Maintain a log of medicines to understand the ones your parents may need during SOS.</p>
      <p>
        <b>5. Are they eating right?</b>
      </p>
      <p>When you eat right, you may prevent several ailments from cropping up in the future. Similarly, keeping your parents’ health issues in mind, tweak their diet to keep them healthy. You can also consult their doctor to understand the right diet for ageing parents and what all should be kept in their fridge at all times.</p>
