      <h1>Uber CEO calls Saudi murder of journalist a ‘mistake,’ then quickly backtracks</h1>
      <h2>‘People make mistakes, it doesn’t mean they can never be forgiven.’</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T11:35:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 11:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/james-vincent" target="_blank">James Vincent</a></address>
      <p>Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has said in an <a href="https://www.axios.com/uber-ceo-saudi-arabia-jamal-khashoggi-mistake-92865f2a-d97c-4d6a-b171-5e7c0a69e77a.html">interview</a> with <i>Axios</i> that the murder of the journalist and US resident Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi Arabia was a “serious mistake,” before comparing the incident to the death <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20951385/uber-self-driving-crash-death-reason-ntsb-dcouments">caused by Uber’s self-driving car</a> and adding that “people make mistakes, it doesn’t mean that they can never be forgiven.”</p>
      <p>Khosrowshahi later backtracked, telling <i>Axios</i> after the interview had ended that he had misspoken. “I said something in the moment that I do not believe,” said the CEO in a statement. “When it comes to Jamal Khashoggi, his murder was reprehensible and should not be forgotten or excused.”</p>

      <p>Khosrowshahi was being questioned over his company’s continuing relationship with the government of Saudi Arabia, which the CIA concluded last year <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-concludes-saudi-crown-prince-ordered-jamal-khashoggis-assassination/2018/11/16/98c89fe6-e9b2-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html">ordered the killing of Khashoggi</a>, who fled the country in 2017 after writing articles <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/in-death-saudi-writers-mild-calls-for-reform-grew-into-a-defiant-shout/2018/10/20/8fa185cc-d48b-11e8-8c22-fa2ef74bd6d6_story.html">critical of the government</a>.</p>
      <p>Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund is the fifth-largest shareholder in Uber, and the head of the wealth fund, Yasir bin Othman Al-Rumayyan, is a member of Uber’s board. In the interview Khosrowshahi praised Al-Rumayyan as a “very constructive board member” and said he valued his input “greatly.”</p>
      <p>Following the death of Khashoggi in 2018, Uber was one of a number of companies who pulled out of Saudi Arabia’s annual investment conference in protest. The move was <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-politics-dissident-uber/bahrain-minister-backs-boycott-of-uber-over-khashoggi-case-idUKKCN1MP0RC">controversial</a> in the Persian Gulf, with a government minister in Bahrain, a close ally of Saudi Arabia, calling on citizens to delete Uber and “boycott anyone who boycotts Saudi Arabia.”</p>
      <p>Khosrowshahi did not attend this year’s Saudi investment conference either, but claimed in the interview with <i>Axios</i> that this was due to a scheduling conflict, not any ethical stance. When asked if he would have attended the conference if he hadn’t had a meeting Khosrowshahi was non-committal, saying he “didn’t know.”</p>
