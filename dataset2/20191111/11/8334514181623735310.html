      <p>SEOUL (Reuters) - An annual K-pop festival is not happening in Hong Kong this year due to months-long political unrest, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said on Monday.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong has hosted the Mnet Asian Music Awards (MAMA) since 2012, where top K-pop artists including global phenomenon boyband BTS performed for years. In previous years, tens of thousands of K-pop fans packed stadiums in Hong Kong for the awards.</p>
      <p>The move follows a number of organizers delaying or cancelling sports, concerts and other events due to the pro-democracy protests. Hong Kong’s premier women’s tennis event planned for October was postponed. The city’s soccer matches were also postponed.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong police shot and critically wounded a protester and a man was doused with petrol and set on fire on Monday as the Chinese-ruled territory spiraled into rare working-day violence in its 24th week of unrest.</p>
      <p>“This year, after internal discussions, the MAMA organizer decided not to hold the event in Hong Kong because of the protests,” the source said.</p>
      <p>South Korea’s CJ ENM Co Ltd (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/035760.KQ">035760.KQ</a>), the show’s organizer, told Reuters in a statement that Hong Kong had not been chosen as the event’s venue, considering “various circumstances,” without elaborating.</p>
      <p>The music awards will take place in Nagoya, Japan on Dec. 4, CJ ENM added.</p>
