      <p>Bandai Namco has released their latest character trailer for Arc System Works anime tag-fighter <i>Dragon Ball FighterZ</i>. The new video gives us a quick look at Broly (DBS), the newest DLC fighter who is expected to join <i>DBFZ's</i> colourful roster in the near future.<br/><br/>This variant of Broly is taken from the 2018 anime <i>Dragon Ball Super: Broly</i>, which saw heroes Goku and Vegeta encounter a Super Saiyan version of Broly, who is exiled from Planet Vegeta as a baby only to return as an immensely powerful fighter. Now built like Scott Steiner with a temper to match. Super Broly is a wild tank of a man, an unbelievable force to be reckoned with.</p>

      <p>The new trailer gives us a decent look at the newest roster addition, and sure beats out those 25-second trailers Bandai Namco were dropping in the run-up to <i>DBFZ's</i> launch. There is no specific date announced for Broly (DBS) as of yet, but he is expected to arrive as part of season two very soon.<br/><br/><i>Dragon Ball FighterZ</i> is available now on PS4, PC, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch.<br/><br/><a href="https://gematsu.com/2019/11/dragon-ball-fighterz-dlc-character-broly-dbs-trailer">Dragon Ball FighterZ DLC character Broly trailer</a> [Gematsu]</p>
