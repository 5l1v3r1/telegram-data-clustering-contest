      <h3>THE country’s flag carrier top brass yesterday mourned for the untimely death of PAL Holdings Inc. (PHI) president Lucio Tan Jr . yesterday.</h3>
      <p>“It is with deep sorrow that I announce the passing of my brother Lucio ‘Bong’ Tan Jr. this morning, November 11, 2019,” Vivienne Tan, daughter of business tycoon Lucio Tan, said  in a statement.</p>
      <p>“He was 53. His untimely passing leaves a big void in our hearts and our Group’s management team which would be very hard to fill. Bong was a son, husband, father, friend and, most importantly, our elder brother whom we all relied on for advice, counsel and leadership,” added Vivienne. </p>
      <p>Bong Tan  is survived by his wife Julie and sons Hun Hun (Lucio Tan III) and Kyle Tan.</p>
      <p>“Our sincerest thanks to all who offered prayers and shared words of comfort during this hour of grief. Our family continues to request everyone to respect our wish for privacy as we go through this very difficult time. We ask for your prayers for the eternal repose of his soul. Wake details will be announced soon,” Vivienne said.</p>
