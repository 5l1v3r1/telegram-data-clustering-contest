      <p>Cyclone Bulbul, packing winds of up to 120km per hour (75 miles/h) when it hit late on Saturday, killed 12 people in Bangladesh - 11 from falling trees - and 12 in India's West Bengal and Odisha states. <br/><br/>Five others remain missing after a fishing trawler sank in squally <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/categories/weather.html">weather</a> near Bangladesh's southern island of Bhola, district administrator Masud Alam Siddiqui told AFP news agency. <br/><br/>Bangladesh's junior minister for disaster management, Enamur Rahman, told AFP Bulbul left a trail of destruction, damaging some 10,000 homes of mud, tin and bamboo and 200,000 hectares (494,000 acres) of crops. <br/><br/>The cyclone weakened as it tracked inland.</p>
      <h3>Battered by cyclones</h3>
      <p>The Sundarbans - the world's largest mangrove forest which straddles the two nations and is home to several endangered species - shielded the coast from the storm's full impact, officials added.</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/India.html">India</a>, nearly 120,000 evacuated people were returning home as the cyclone weakened, authorities said. Coastal crops in Odisha were also extensively damaged, officials told the Press Trust of India news agency. <br/><br/>Bangladesh's low-lying coast, home to 30 million people, and India's east are regularly battered by cyclones that have killed hundreds of thousands of people in recent decades. <br/><br/>While the storms' frequency and intensity have increased - partly due to <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/issues/climate-change.html">climate change</a> - the death tolls have come down because of faster evacuations and the building of thousands of coastal shelters.</p>
      <p>In India, flights in and out of Kolkata airport <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/deadly-cyclone-bulbul-weakens-depression-bangladesh-191110055831520.html">were suspended</a> for 12 hours because of the storm.</p>
      <p>The cyclone season in the Bay of Bengal can last from April to December. In 1999, a super-cyclone battered the coast of India's Odisha state for 30 hours, killing nearly 10,000 people.</p>
