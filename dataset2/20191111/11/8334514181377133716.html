      <p>MADRID (Reuters) - The leader of Spain’s Ciudadanos, Albert Rivera, on Monday said he had resigned as party president and lawmaker after the centre-right party saw its support plunge in Sunday’s election.</p>
      <p>Rivera, visibly moved, said he took responsibility for the party’s “poor result” in hopes that the party would return to its roots as a centrist and liberal political project, in televised remarks after meeting with his party’s executive committee.</p>
      <p>Ciudadanos won 10 seats in Sunday’s election, less than a fifth of 57 seats won in the previous April election.</p>
      <p>Various potential solutions to unblock the stalemate, however, involve Ciudadanos, alongside regionalist parties.</p>
