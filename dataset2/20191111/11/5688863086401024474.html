        <b>After losing the ODI series to India women’s side at home and losing the first T20I, the loss of skipper Stafanie Taylor has been like salt to the Windies’ wound. Anisa Mohammed will lead the West Indies in the remainder of the series while Cherry-Ann Fraser has been named as Taylor’s replacement.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The ongoing West Indies tour of India women’s cricket team has been one to forget for the hosts. India clinched the three-match ODI series in an impressive fashion, after losing the first ODI by just a run, and the five-match T20 series seems to be the only way for West Indies women to salvage some pride. But the loss of their skipper Stafanie Taylor after being handed an 84-run hammering in the first T20 of the series has made it tougher for the home side to stage a comeback as the visitors have taken a 2-0 lead.</p>
      <p>According to a Cricket West Indies statement, Taylor suffered a ligament strain in the final match of the ODI series which ruled her out of the T20 series. In Taylor’s absence, Anisa Mohammed will lead the West Indies in the remainder of the series, while Shemaine Campbelle will be the vice-captain.</p>
      <p>“This is as a result of an injury sustained during the third Colonial Medical Insurance One Day International against India Women in Antigua. Team physiotherapist Matthew Parchment, after consultation with CWI’s Chief Medical Officer, has advised that Stafanie (Taylor) sustained a Grade I Medial Collateral Ligament Sprain, which requires two weeks of recovery,” CWI said in the statement.</p>
      <p>CWI’s women’s and girls selection panel’s lead selector of the panel Ann Browne-John highlighted that the T20 World Cup isn't far away and she wants Taylor to be fit and refreshed for the gala event of T20 cricket.</p>
      <p>“It is very disappointing to lose Stafanie (Taylor) at this crucial time and she will no doubt be missed but her health and recovery are of utmost importance. We have the <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/tournament/icc_t20_world_cup">ICC T20 World Cup</a> in a few months and it is critical that Stafanie gets the time to recover and return to full fitness,” Sportstar quoted Browne-John saying so.</p>
      <p>Young allrounder Cherry-Ann Fraser has been called up to replace the skipper and Browne-John heaped her with praise as she stressed on exposing her raw talent on the international stage.</p>
      <p>“Cherry-Ann Fraser is a young Guyanese all-rounder who was in the last camp and we were impressed by her performance. Therefore having her join the team now will get her that experience to further her development.”</p>
