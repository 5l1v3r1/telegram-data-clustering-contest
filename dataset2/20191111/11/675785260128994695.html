      <h1>Kevin de Bruyne's chat with Jurgen Klopp sparks wild Liverpool transfer rumours</h1>
      <h2>Liverpool recorded a convincing 3-1 win over Premier League champions Manchester City on Sunday to move eight points clear at the top of the table</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T11:14:51+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 11:14</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool fans have reacted in exactly the way you'd expect to a video of Kevin de Bruyne chatting to Jurgen Klopp and Mohamed Salah after Sunday's 3-1 win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City.</a></p>
      <p>Well, it's not everyday your team beats the back-to-back Premier League champions, moving eight points clear of them at the top of the table in the process, is it?</p>
      <p>Excitement was understandably high, and a clip posted to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> by Spanish TV network <a href="https://twitter.com/TelemundoSports/status/1193617434936139776?s=20">Telemundo Deportes</a> caught the attention on supporters.</p>
      <p>In the video, De Bruyne is stood talking to Salah for some time; the pair briefly crossed paths at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea,</a> and are clearly still friendly.</p>
      <p>Later in the clip, Klopp joins the pair catching up in the corridor and initially speaks to Salah, even putting his arm around the Egyptian.</p>

      <p>But it isn't long before the German turns to face De Bruyne and the trio have a short conversation.</p>
      <p>Klopp later leaves the duo to it, but the brief exchange wasn't missed by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> supporters, with many of them calling on the club to sign De Bruyne.</p>
      <p>"Kevin de Bruyne over [Kylian] Mbappe. I'd rather De Bruyne in the our squad," tweeted one Liverpool fan, while another added the same: "I'd rather us sign De Bruyne than Mbappe."</p>

      <p>A third said: "I can't wait until he joins us next year," and a fourth concluded: "Kevin de Bruyne was a Liverpool fan growing up, about time he joins us... would be lovely."</p>
      <p>De Bruyne was looking forward to playing at Anfield ahead of Sunday's match.</p>
      <p>He told <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11679/11857984/kevin-de-bruyne-manchester-city-midfielders-love-affair-with-anfield">Sky Sports:</a> "If you are somebody who wants to compete for titles and win, these are the games you want to play.</p>

      <p>"I like Anfield, I like it a lot. I love people being on you, being noisy, that is what it's all about. I love the passion of football.</p>
      <p>"The home players probably get a little bit more [from the Anfield atmosphere] but even if it's against you, you are at the top of the world, playing the best level. That is what you want."</p>
