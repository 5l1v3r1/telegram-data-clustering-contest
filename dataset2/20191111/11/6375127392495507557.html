      <h3>‘Lacking sleep,’ ‘overworked,’ President Duterte flies to Davao to rest for 3 days on doctor’s advice</h3>
      <p>UPON the advice of his doctor President Rodrigo Duterte will take a break from work for three days so he can rest, Malacañang said yesterday.</p>
      <p>The Palace previously said the President’s doctor had advised him to take some rest and limit his physical activity after he suffered from muscular spasm following a motorcycle accident inside the Presidential Security Group compound within the Malacañang Complex on October 16.  </p>
      <p>Presidential spokesman Salvado Panelo initially said the handling of the government would be left to Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea.</p>
      <p>However, Panelo later said there might be no need for a caretaker. He did not elaborate.</p>
      <p>The President starts his leave today and will spend much of his rest time in his hometown of Davao City, Panelo said. The President needs rest because of lack of sleep and he is “overworked,” added the presidential spokesperson.</p>
      <p>Duterte recently returned from the 35th Association of Southeast Asian Nations Summit and Related Summits held in Thailand. Before this trip, he had attended the enthronement ceremony for Japanese Emperor Naruhito. His Japan trip was cut short because of back pains from his motorcycle accident and he was  not able to attend the last function at the ASEAN event.</p>
      <p>Malacañang attributed the President’s back pain to back muscle spasms and not to injury from his motorcycle spill. The Palace has said there is no need to come out with a medical bulletin on the state of the President’s health.</p>
      <p>No PNP chief yet</p>
      <p>In another development Senator Bong Go yesterday said that President Rodrigo Duterte is finding it difficult to find a “perfect honest man” to lead the 190,000-strong Philippine National Police (PNP) following the retirement of former PNP chief Oscar Albayalde.</p>
      <p>During the interview with the Senate reporters, Go said that President Duterte is having a hard time in choosing the next PNP chief.</p>
      <p>“Wala pa po. As of last night, magkasama po kami ng Pangulo,  wala pa po syang napipisil,” said Go.</p>
      <p>“Siguro talagang hirap na hirap ang ating Pangulong Duterte. Totoo yung sinabi ni Pangulo, naghahanap sya ng honest na magiging chief PNP,” he added.</p>
      <p>“Yung hinahanap nya na honest ay still searching pa po si Pangulong Duterte…Hirap na hirap s’yang hanapin yung perfect na honest man na hinahanap nya,” Go further said.</p>
      <p>Interior Secretary Eduardo Año has already submitted the names of three police officials as candidates for the PNP top post.</p>
      <p>The three contenders are  PNP officer-in-charge Lieutenant General Archie Francisco Gamboa, deputy chief for operations Lieutenant General Camilo Cascolan, and Chief of the Directorial Staff Major General Guillermo Eleazar.</p>
      <p>But  Go said  Duterte’s choices are not limited to the three.</p>
      <p>The President, he said, has the prerogative to choose among the one-star rank generals in the PNP.</p>
      <p>“Ibig sabihin ay posibleng lumabas dyan sa tatlo ang kanyang pipiliin,” said Go.  </p>
