Before then, drivers will be required to have an account and topped it up with credit.<br/><br/><b>How much will it cost?</b><br/>A total of Dhs4 will be charged every time a vehicle passes through one of the gates in Abu Dhabi during peak times. Peak times are between 7am and 9am then 5pm and 7pm Saturday to Thursday. During off-peak hours and public holidays, the fee will be reduced Dhs2. A maximum fee of Dhs16 will be charged each day, so drivers passing through four or more toll gates each day at peak times will not be charged more than the daily maximum. Some government vehicles, emergency services and motorcycles are exempt from the charge. Electric cars are being given a two-year grace period and must be registered from October 2021.<br/><br/><b>When is the fee reduced? </b><br/>During off-peak hours, Fridays and public holidays the toll will be reduced to Dhs2. Off peak hours are between 7pm and 7am then 9am to 5pm, Saturday to Thursday.<br/><br/><b>How is it charged? </b><br/>Drivers are required to create an account before the launch on January 1 where they can add credit. Vehicles will not be required to add a sticker to their window and they will instead be identified by the license plate number and credit will be taken automatically from the owner's account.<br/><br/><b>How do I set up an account?</b><br/>Drivers are now able to register their vehicle and prepare for the January 1 launch date by visiting <a href="http://www.itps.itc.gov.ae/">www.itps.itc.gov.ae</a>. Drivers with vehicles registered in Abu Dhabi will be automatically added to the system. All users registering must have a valid Emirates ID card, car registration, email address and phone number to create their account. Additionally, for drivers with vehicles registered outside Abu Dhabi, a minimum of Dhs100 must be added to an account when being registered for the new system. An amount of this deposit, said to be Dhs50, will be paid back into the users account to be used to pay tolls.<br/><br/><b>Are there fines?</b><br/>Fines will be in place for a number of different offences effective from January 1. Passing through a toll gate with an unregistered vehicle, after a ten-day grace period, will result in a Dhs100 fine for the first day, Dhs200 for the second day, Dhs400 for the third day, up to the maximum fine of Dhs10,000. Passing through a toll gate with insufficient balance, after the ten day grace period will result in a fine of Dhs50. Drivers who tamper with their license plate in order to evade the toll will also be fined Dhs10,000.<br/><br/><b>Can you use a Dubai Salik account? </b><br/>No, drivers will be required to have a separate account for the Abu Dhabi tolls. The two road toll systems are entirely independent of one another. So drivers commuting between the capital and Dubai will have to ensure they have sufficient balance in their Abu Dhabi and Salik account or face fines.<br/><br/><b>Where are the tolls?</b><br/>Four toll gates throughout Abu Dhabi and these are already in place but are not yet activated. The tolls are located at the following bridges: Sheikh Zayed Bridge, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Bridge, Al Maqtaa Bridge and Mussafah Bridge. Drivers who are on the roads on Abu Dhabi island not passing through gates will not be charged. In addition, those on Yas Island, Khalifa City A, Al Raha Beach and the surrounding areas, not travelling to Abu Dhabi island, will not have to pay tolls.<br/><br/><b>Why has this been introduced? </b><br/>The Department of Transport - Abu Dhabi says it aims to reduce traffic congestion and raise the efficiency of public transport services with the introduction of the new system. The move also aims to encourage drivers to consider carpooling and reducing the number of vehicles on the road in the city. To help residents get around the city 327 new buses have been introduced to Abu Dhabi.<br/><br/><b>Where can I find out more?</b><br/>For more information, visit <a href="http://www.itps.itc.gov.ae/">www.itps.itc.gov.ae</a></p>
