      <h1>Strictly's Aljaz Skorjanec dishes on Mike Bushell being booted off the show</h1>
      <h2>The Strictly Come Dancing professional discussed Sunday night's results during an appearance on Heart radio</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T11:33:58+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 11:33</time> by <a rel="author">Sara-Aisha Kent, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/sara-aisha-kent/</a></address>
      <p>Strictly Come Dancing's Aljaz Skorjanec has opened up on Mike Bushell being axed from the 2019 series of the hit dancing show.</p>
      <p>The professional dished on Mike and Katya Jones being booted off following Sunday night's result show during an interview on Heart radio on Monday morning.</p>
      <p>Aljaz, who was partnered up with Emma Weymouth until they became the sixth couple to be voted off, addressed the axing after host Jamie Theakston quizzed the Slovenian native if he thought Mike was relieved to say goodbye to the dancing floor.</p>
      <p>He told: "I think yes and no, I think relieved maybe because he has done so many dance offs but not relieved because I think he should be so proud go how incredibly well he has done in the competition."</p>
      <p>Jamie probed: "Is it fair to say it was his time? Looking at other contestants as well, it seemed like the right time, it seemed like the right time?"</p>

      <p>Careful with his words, Aljaz replied: "You know what it is such a feel good show! You want to stay in as many weeks as possible. Whatever dance you can learn and master is just a bonus. So I don’t think anyone is ever ready to leave Strictly!"</p>
      <p>Reflecting on his own experience, he finished: "I don’t ever want to leave, ever!"</p>
      <p>Aljaz's interview comes after Mike spoke out against reports he was "desperate" to leave <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> .</p>
      <p>The BBC sports presenter was said to be "relieved" after being sent packing by the judges on last night's result show.</p>
      <p>But he has claimed that it couldn't be further from the truth.</p>

      <p>Mike, who faced a dance off with Michelle Visage alongside his partner Katya, has said he's gutted that he didn't make it to Blackpool.</p>
      <p>But he's delighted he lasted long enough to be added to the line-up for the live tour.</p>
      <p>Mike said in a statement released to Mirror Online: "This is so far from the truth, it is a complete fabrication and without any foundation.</p>

      <p>"I’ve loved every second of my Strictly journey, it the best show ever and I was really hoping to be competing in Blackpool and beyond.</p>
      <p>"I’m gutted to be out but at the same time wanted to leave with head held high and gracious in defeat.</p>
      <p>"When I was eliminated I wanted to celebrate the journey I’d been on, and the fact that I’m so excited to be doing the tour shows that I want my Strictly journey to go on."</p>
      <p>It was reported that Mike, who was in the bottom two for the fourth this this weekend, had told friends he was glad it was all over.</p>
