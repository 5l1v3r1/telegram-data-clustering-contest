      <h3>THE Philippine National Police yesterday asked the Department of Justice to indict retired police chief Oscar Albayalde and several other police officers tagged in the alleged recycling of illegal drugs worth P650 million.</h3>
      <p>In an amended complaint, the PNP charged Albayalde with graft, qualified bribery, falsification of public documents, dereliction of duty, and violation of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act.</p>
      <p>Albayalde was included in the complaint which was previously filed by the PNP against 13 police officers before the DOJ. He is now first on the list of respondents.</p>
      <p>Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Q. Orsos, PNP/CIDG Legal Division chief previously said that probers used as basis testimonial evidence from witnesses, and the report of the Senate which extensively investigated the controversy, in filing the complaint against Albayalde.</p>
      <p>“Mga lumang ebidensya at yung transcript sa Senate. Totality of the evidence shows that he is probably liable. Yung probability lang,” he said when asked about the police’s basis in filing the amended complaint against the former PNP chief.</p>
      <p>It was learned that the PNP-CIDG presented new witnesses, including barangay officials from Mexico town in Pampanga.</p>
      <p>During the Senate inquiry, Albayalde was also accused by then PNP-CIDG chief Benjamin Magalong of seeking to defer the dismissal order against his former subordinates. </p>
      <p>The former PNP chief relinquished his post ahead of his retirement on November 8.</p>
      <p>The DOJ will resume the preliminary investigation on November 11.</p>
