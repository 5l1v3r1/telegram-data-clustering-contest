      <h1>Daniel James' teammate recalls rise from "funny little fat kid" to Man Utd star</h1>
      <h2>James, 22, has enjoyed an impressive start to his career at Old Trafford after arriving from boyhood club Swansea in a £18million summer switch</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T11:39:22+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 11:39</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Daniel James' Wales teammate and close pal Connor Roberts has given a fascinating insight into the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> starlet's stunning rise to stardom.</p>
      <p>James, 22, has enjoyed an impressive start to his career at Old Trafford after arriving from boyhood club Swansea in a £18million summer switch, netting three goals in his first four games.</p>
      <p>Although his exploits in front of goal have taken a sudden dip - he has gone 12 games in all competitions without scoring - James is regarded as one of the most exciting talents in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>He was so desperate to make an instant impact at Old Trafford that he jetted off for a warm-weather training camp in Dubai on his own - and eventually topped all the initial pre-season fitness tests.</p>

      <p>But the Welsh wing wizard hasn't always been in tip-top shape, as revealed by Swansea defender Roberts.</p>
      <p>Reminiscing about James' emergence for Swansea's U23s, Roberts told <a href="https://theathletic.com/1357297/2019/11/11/the-making-of-dan-james-uniteds-flying-machine/">The Athletic</a> : “My first thoughts were, ‘You wouldn’t think he is as quick as he is.’ I thought he was a funny little fat kid.</p>
      <p>“He had the pace — that’s what he thrives on. We always used to joke that he’s the fastest chubby kid we’ve ever seen.</p>
      <p>"In recent years, he has got more toned but when he first came, he almost had a little bit of a belly on him. I was like, ‘Well, he can’t be that fast.’ But obviously he is.”</p>

      <p>“He is a proper professional. Nights before games, he was on the foam roller, stretching, getting himself ready."</p>
      <p>Roberts also opened up on James heartbreak after his father Kevan tragically passed away days before he sealed his move to United.</p>
      <p>He added: “Every time I shared rooms with him, he would be on the phone to his mum or dad.</p>
      <p>"What happened with his dad is even more heart-breaking because he was so close to him.”</p>
