      <h1>Benjamin Netanyahu: Yitzhak Rabin 'Was Not a Traitor'</h1>
      <h2>(UPI) — Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that slain Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin “was not a traitor” for approving the 1993 Oslo Accords and admitted he should have spoken out more against those who labeled him as one.</h2>

      <p>The Oslo Accords started the possible two-state solution the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which caused bitter debate in Israel. Rabin was assassinated in 1995. Netanyahu said while the debate over the accords was legitimate, the demonizing of Rabin was not.</p>
      <p>Speaking at an annual ceremony for Rabin at Mount Herzl, Netanyahu said others were now trying to use Rabin’s death for political gain.</p>
      <p>“What was not legitimate was to call Yitzhak Rabin a ‘traitor’ or a ‘murderer,'” Netanyahu said. “Over the years since the murder, I have heard this false claim by fanatics who oppose Oslo” Netanyahu said.</p>
      <p>“I stood to the side, I was silent and did not respond. At times, I even encouraged it. But repeating a lie many times does not make it true. Here is what I said then, countless times. No, Rabin was not a traitor. He was wrong, but he was not a traitor.”</p>
      <p>Rabin’s grandson, Yonatan Ben-Artzi, though, said Netanyahu and other party leaders need to “take responsibility for your actions … If you are stained, move aside, leave office. Go home and deal with the personal claims against you.”</p>
      <p>Netanyahu’s political rival Benny Gantz also called out public officials who criticized Rabin at the time.</p>
      <p>“At this time, some public officials are leading a delegitimization campaign whose possible result is the disintegration of Israeli society,” Gantz said.</p>
      <p>Gantz has until later this month to form a coalition government after Netanyahu failed to after September’s tight national election.</p>
