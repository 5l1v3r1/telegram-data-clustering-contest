      <p>Tsepo Masilela made his debut for AmaZulu on the weekend as a late substitute in the 2-0 loss against Chippa United.   </p>
      <p>The former Kaizer Chiefs defender was signed by AmaZulu on Saturday after he impressed the team’s head coach Jozef Vukusic in training.</p>

      <p>The 34-year-old left-back has been without a club since leaving Kaizer Chiefs at the end of the 2017/18 season.  </p>
      <p>“It is a great feeling to be given another opportunity to prove my worth... I have been here for a while now, getting to know everyone and seeing how things work. I have spoken to the coach and he has made it clear, what is expected of me.</p>
      <p>"I know it won’t be easy to break into the first team but we have some good players and it shows on the pitch as we have been winning lately, so I look forward to pushing each other and hopefully we can have a successful season,” said the defender, as quoted on AmaZulu’s official website.</p>

      <p>Next up for Usuthu is a trip to Mamelodi Sundowns after the international break, where the ex-Amakhosi star will be hoping to get his first start in AmaZulu colours after his recent cameo appearance.  </p>
