      <h3>THE Vice President has turned the drug war into “Operation All Talk,” Speaker Alan Peter Cayateno said betraying his dismay over Vice President Leni Robredo as lead campaigner against the drug menace.  </h3>
      <p>According to Cayetano, Robredo is “all talk” when it comes to solving the problem of illegal drugs.</p>
      <p>Last week President Rodrigo Duterte appointed Robredo as co-chairman of the Inter-Agency Committee on Anti-Illegal Drugs (ICAD).</p>
      <p>Following her acceptance of the position, Robredo proposed the scrapping of Oplan Tokhang as well as opening the campaign against illegal drugs to the United Nations probe.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been monitoring the last three days and parang from Oplan Tokhang, naging Operation All Talk. I guess it just so happens that the Vice President is a favorite of the media or she likes media exposure,” Cayetano said in an interview.</p>
      <p>He also said Robredo has started “on the wrong mouth” and has not yet called a briefing from other agencies but already spewing out ideas and criticisms.</p>
      <p>“Now she’s saying magpapa-briefing sa lahat ng department at lahat agencies, eh hindi pa pala nagbriefing, so why already these ideas,” Cayetano said.</p>
      <p>Cayetano appealed to Robredo to stop politicking on the issue of illegal drugs but instead respect what the administration has started.</p>
      <p>“Dapat tanggalin ang politics whether from the opposition or the administration when it comes to the drug war,” he stressed.</p>
      <p>He said that the success of the ICAD and Robredo is the success of the whole country.</p>
