      <p>Eintracht suffered a 1-0 league defeat to Freiburg on Sunday, courtesy of Nils Petersen's goal, in a match that was marred by ugly scenes just before the final whistle.</p>
      <p>The incident occurred during the dying stages of the match, when Frankfurt captain David Abraham appeared to intentionally charge into Freiburg boss Christian Streich on the sidelines.</p>
      <p>The 54-year-old manager was knocked to the ground, which sparked a mass brawl between players and staff of the two clubs.</p>

      <p>Abraham was subsequently shown a red card, as was Freiburg midfielder Vincenzo Grifo, before the referee blew his whistle for full time.</p>
      <p>Frankfurt sporting director Fredi Bobic has since commented on the incident, confirming that there will be repercussions for all involved.</p>
      <p>"He (Abraham) felt provoked but that shouldn't happen... he knows that," Bobic said, as reported by<i> The Guardian</i>.  </p>
      <p>"There will be consequences for everyone involved."</p>
