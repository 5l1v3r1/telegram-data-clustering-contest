      <p>Breaking the news to her 1.3m followers on <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/instagram">Instagram</a>, Mackintosh shared a photograph from a photoshoot with <i><a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/healthandbeauty/mother-and-baby/2019111080359/millie-mackintosh-expecting-baby-girl-with-hugo-taylor-exclusive/">Hello! magazine</a></i> showing her holding her growing baby bump.</p>
      <p>“So excited to announce that we're expecting!!!” the 30-year-old captioned the image.</p>
      <p>In an accompanying interview, Mackintosh described hearing the baby’s heartbeat for the first time as “one of the most amazing moments” of her life.</p>
      <p>“I feel very lucky. I can’t wait to feel that bond and for her to sleep on my chest and breathe in that baby smell,” Mackintosh said. </p>
      <p>“I’m so excited it’s a girl. I would’ve been delighted with either, but when I found out we were having a girl, I suddenly realised this is what I really wanted.”</p>
      <p>Mackintosh, who was previously married to rapper <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/professor-green">Professor Green</a>, said she has been preparing for <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Motherhood">motherhood</a> by babysitting Theodore, the one-year-old son of fellow <i>Made in Chelsea</i> star <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/spencer-matthews">Spencer Matthews</a> and model <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/vogue-williams">Vogue Williams</a>.</p>
      <p>“Theodore is so sweet,” she said.</p>
      <p>“It was hard when he cried and we were so relieved when he settled down to sleep. Everyone says it’s different when it’s your own.”</p>
      <p>The reality TV star’s Instagram post has garnered more than 191,000 likes and received hundreds of comments from fans and celebrity friends, including Williams who commented: “Yeyyyyyyyyyy!!!! Theodores new bestie," followed by several heart emojis.</p>
