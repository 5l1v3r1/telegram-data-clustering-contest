      <h3>THE Philippine National Police Criminal Investigation and Detection Group yesterday announced the arrest of four men including an Indian national believed to be involved in robbery-holdup and other criminal activities in Metro Manila following two separate anti-crime operations last Friday.</h3>
      <p>A report to PNP-CIDG director, Brigadier General Joel Napoleon M. Coronel identified the arrested suspects as Patbhjot Garye Singh alias ‘Gurjeet Singh,’ Carlo Ardinio alias ‘Enrico,’ Aypee de Guzman and Christopher Lim.</p>
      <p>CIDG National Capital Region chief, Colonel Ronald Hipolito said that Singh was arrested inside his house in Sampaguita Street in Barangay San Carlos, Binangonan, Rizal which was raided by members of the CIDG Central Metro Manila District Field Unit at 2:30 p.m. last Friday.</p>
      <p>The suspect was placed under arrest after officers recovered a caliber .45 pistol with 16 live ammunition inside his room. The suspect’s passport and Alien Certificate of Registration were confiscated by the CIDG.</p>
      <p>Hipolito said that Singh is believed to be the leader of the Singh Criminal Group known for robbing Indian ‘5-6’ money-lenders in Rizal and its nearby areas. The suspect is now facing charges for violation of Republic Act 10591 or the Comprehensive Firearms and Ammunition Regulation Act of 2013.</p>
      <p>The other three suspects led by Ardinio were arrested in an entrapment operation conducted by undercover officers of the CIDG Northern Metro Manila District Field Unit, with the assistance of the Northern Police District and the Caloocan City Police Station around 3 p.m. Friday in Caloocan-Bulacan Bridge in Phase 9, Bgy. Bagong Silang.</p>
      <p>Hipolito said that Ardinio and his cohorts have just conspired to sell a cal. .38 revolver to a poseur for P3,500 when they were arrested. Recovered from the suspects’ possession were a cal. .38 revolver and a 9mm semi-automatic pistol, both with defaced serial numbers, an improvised 12-gauge shotgun and four cal. .38 ammunition.</p>
      <p>The CIDG-NCR chief said that Ardinio is believed to be the head of the Enrico Criminal Gang engaged in drug trafficking, gunrunning, gun-for-hire and robbery-holdup activities in different parts of Camanava district and nearby provinces and cities.</p>
