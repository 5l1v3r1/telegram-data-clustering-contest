      <h1>Singles Day: £500,000 spent every second during world’s busiest shopping spree in China</h1>
      <h2>E-commerce giants on course for record haul despite fears of consumer demand slowing</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T11:27:16+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 11:27</time> by <a rel="author">Conrad Duncan</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/China">China</a>’s e-commerce giants have reported a total of almost £43bn in sales at the midway point of “Singles Day“, the annual marketing event that has become the world’s busiest online shopping day.</p>
      <p>The current total means Chinese shoppers have been spending at a rate of nearly £500,000 per second across the day and has provided a temporary relief to retailers who fear a slowdown in consumer demand.</p>
      <p>A combination of slowing economic growth and China’s <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/us-china-trade-war">tariff war</a> with the US has forced people to cut back on spending.</p>
      <p>Singles Day was created in the 1990s as an alternative to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/valentines-day">Valentine’s Day</a> for people without romantic partners and falls on 11 November because the date is written with four singles – “11/11”.</p>
      <p>It has been adopted by companies such as <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/alibaba">Alibaba</a>, JD.com and Suning as a national shopping holiday over the past decade and launched this year with a gala headlined by pop star <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/TaylorSwift">Taylor Swift</a>.</p>
      <p>The event is similar to Black Friday in the US and involves retailers offering discounts on a diverse range of goods, such as smartphones, craft beer and health care packages.</p>
      <p>Alibaba said merchants’ sales on its platforms totalled 205.7 billion yuan (£23bn) between midnight and mid-afternoon, while JD.com reported sales of 179.4 billion yuan (£20bn) over the same period.</p>
      <p>E-commerce has expanded rapidly in China due to a lack of traditional retailing networks and government efforts to encourage internet use.</p>
      <p>This year’s Singles Day was the first since Alibaba’s founder, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/jack-ma">Jack Ma</a>, stepped down as the company’s chairman in September.</p>
      <p>Mr Ma is China’s richest entrepreneur with a net worth of £30.5bn, according to the wealth-tracking Hurun Report, and is known for his vibrant persona.</p>

      <p>In 2017, Mr Ma performed a dance routine to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a> hits at the Alibaba annual party that ended with him being lifted off stage on a motorbike.</p>
      <p>Last year, Alibaba reported Singles Day sales of 213.5 billion yuan (£24bn) – more than 13 times its average daily sales.</p>
      <p>Although China’s online spending is growing faster than total retail sales, spending is weakening as the country’s economy slows.</p>
      <p>E-commerce makes up 19.5 per cent of consumer spending in China, compared to about 11 per cent of spending for American consumers.</p>
      <p>However, not everyone is in favour of the online shopping spree.</p>
      <p>Environmental groups have criticised Singles Day in recent years, due to the large amount of packaging waste it generates.</p>
      <p>Although there is no official figure for the waste created, Greenpeace claims that it has exceeded 250,000 tonnes.</p>
      <p>“If we continue on our current path, delivery waste in China is on track to quadruple by 2025,” Greenpeace East Asia said in a tweet on Monday.</p>
      <p>“Singles’ day is an annual reminder that we need to cut down on waste.”</p>
