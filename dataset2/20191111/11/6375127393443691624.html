      <h3>CAMP OLIVAS, Pampanga – Newly-designated Police Regional Office 3 director Brig. Gen. Rhodel Sermonia gave the 140 chiefs of police in Central Luzon one month to reform their respective offices.</h3>
      <p>Sermonia directed the police chiefs to implement the Philippine National Police’s  programs to counter the communist rebels, to revitalize the Recovery and Wellness Programs (RWP) of the police for surrendered illegal drugs personalities, and to conduct internal cleansing initiatives that aims to boost public confidence and foster people’s cooperation with the PNP.</p>
      <p>The PRO3 director convened over the weekend the 140 police heads from Aurora, Bataan, Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Tarlac, Zambales and the cities of Angeles and Olongapo and laid-down the programs of the PNP in Region 3, especially community relations thrust programs in relation to Executive Order70 or the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (ELCAC), the reactivation of community-based reformation centers for surrendered drugs personalities, and measures that will boost transparency in police service.</p>
      <p>Sermonia told the chiefs of police that they will be relieved from their posts if they fail to comply with the one-month deadline.</p>
      <p>He said there are lots of police officers in the organization that are waiting to be given the opportunity to be assigned as chief of police, and he is willing to give them the chance should the incumbents failed to deliver in one month time.</p>
      <p>The new PRO3 chief said he wants all police commanders to become ambassadors of police community relations function of the PNP and to embrace by heart the imperatives of community mobilization as effective tools in ensuring the success of the PNP in all its programs relative to public safety and peace and order.</p>
      <p>Sermonia said that paramount to achieving success in the implementation of these programs is for the chiefs of police to learn how to collaborate with the community.  </p>
      <p>He likewise warned police commanders not to take lightly his programs, much more resist it by entertaining a thought that the programs were merely an added burden to the PNP.</p>
      <p>He directed all chiefs-of-police to start reaching out to local government executives, other stakeholders, advocacy support groups, and force multipliers to create a solid collaborative partnership, a key to the success of the programs of PRO3 in fighting insurgency, criminality as well as erring policemen.</p>
      <p>Among the community engagement programs relative to anti-criminality and anti-terrorism efforts that Sermonia reintroduced in Region 3 for all the chiefs of police to implement in one month time are programs related to ELCAC such as the Kabataan Kontra Droga At Terorismo (KKDAT), the Joint Industrial Peace Concerns Office (JIPCO), Kaligtasan at Kalikasan (KALIGKASAN), programs relevant to recovery and wellness of surrendered drug pushers, the Bahay-Pagbabago Reformation Centers and other similar facilities, and his “open door policy” on internal cleansing.</p>
      <p>The KKDAT is an ongoing community relations program of the PNP that aims to prevent youth from falling prey to illegal drugs abuse and deprive communist agitators from recruiting youths and students into joining the New People’s Army of the Communist Party of the Philippines.  </p>
      <p>The JIPCO aims to insulate industrial zones and economic zones from being infiltrated by CPP’s front organizations like Kilusang Mayo Uno and Bagong Alyansang Makabayan.</p>
      <p>Sermoni said the aggressive campaign against high-value targets on illegal drugs must continue. He wants all reformation centers for surrendered drug pushers built in places where there is none.  </p>
      <p>Other programs Sermonia introduced to the chiefs of police were the PCR express connect, the Expanded Pulis Serbis Caravan, the TV-program Rektang Konek, Aksyon Agad, which he is the program host being the National President of the Association of Chiefs of Police of the Philippines Inc. (ACPPI), and the Patrulya ng Bayan.</p>
