      <h1>Weezer – “California Snow” Video (Feat. Adam DeVine)</h1>

      <p>More than a year ago, Weezer shared an extremely poppy, genuinely terrible single called “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2015265/weezer-california-snow-spell/music/">California Snow</a>.” They’d contributed the song to the soundtrack of <i>Spell</i>, a drama about a grieving American illustrator wandering the Icelandic wilderness. The movie, which also has a score from Fall Out Boy singer Patrick Stump, didn’t come out last year, but Weezer evidently liked “California Snow” enough that they used it on the 2019 self-titled LP that everyone calls <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2033970/weezer-black-album/music/album-stream/">the Black Album</a>. Now that <i>Spell</i> is finally getting a release, it now has a music video.</p>
      <p>The actor Adam DeVine is a man who has been very funny in a great many contexts: <i>Workaholics</i>, the <i>Pitch Perfect</i> movies, <i>The Righteous Gemstones</i>. (When Kelvin Gemstone does that elaborate trampoline routine for Jesus? Holy shit.) Today, DeVine shows up in the “California Snow” video, aggressively lip-syncing the Weezer song. DeVine is plays a psychiatrist, but he might also play Rivers Cuomo <i>as</i> a psychiatrist; it’s hard to tell.</p>
      <p>DeVine stars alongside <i>Spell</i> actor and screenwriter Barak Hardley. <i>Spell</i> director <a href="http://brendanwalter.net/">Brendan Walter</a> also directed the video, and it’s a full-on movie tie-in, with what appear to be scenes from film worked in. (I guess Hardley stabs himself in the ear with an icepick at some point?) You can watch the video below.</p>
