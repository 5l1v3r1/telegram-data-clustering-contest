      <p>Retired President Daniel Arap Moi was on Saturday rushed back to Nairobi Hospital, two days after being discharged.</p>
      <p>Moi had been at the facility for close to two weeks with breathing complications. Sources said that the former head of state was admitted at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).</p>
      <p>His long-serving press secretary Lee Njiru on Monday confirmed that Moi is back in hospital and is currently admitted at the VIP wing for mandatory check-ups.</p>

      <p>Mr Njiru also noted that Kenya’s second president is alert and in a stable condition. He did however warn against sharing alarmist health reports.</p>
      <p>“I appeal to the press fraternity not to cause unwarranted alarm by exploiting the credulity of the masses,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mzee Moi, his spokesman said, is being taken care of by his medical team led by his personal physician Dr David Silverstein.</p>
      <p>The ex president has had knee surgery following a car accident in 2006. The first surgery was performed at Aga Khan Hospital in 2017 and later flown to Israel in 2018 over an “uncomfortable knee.”</p>
