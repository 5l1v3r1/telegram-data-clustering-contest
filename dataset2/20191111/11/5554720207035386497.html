      <p>The Congress has finally released an official statement on the government formation in Maharashtra with Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray likely to become the new chief minister. Amidst speculations on Congress possibly extending outside support to the Shiv Sena, the party issued an official release.</p>

      <p>It said, “The Congress Working Committee met this morning and held a detailed discussion on the situation in Maharashtra after which a consultation was held with Maharashtra Congress leaders.

      <p>Earlier, in a significant development on Monday, Shiv Sena supremo Uddhav Thackeray reportedly spoke to Congress President Sonia Gandhi. According to news agency ANI, the conversation between Thackeray and Sonia Gandhi took place over the phone a while back.</p>
      <p>The development assumes huge significance in light of speculations that Thackeray will stake his claim to form the government with the outside support of the NCP and the Congress.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Thackeray had held talks with NCP chief Sharad Pawar at a five-star hotel in Mumbai.</p>
      <p>Today’s extraordinary developments took place moments after Arvind Sawant, the lone Shiv Sena minister in the central government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. <a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/india/shiv-sena-severs-ties-with-bjp-at-centre-arvind-sawant-quits-as-union-minister-amidst-new-political-alignment-in-maharashtra/272085/">resigned</a>. This was widely seen as the Shiv Sena severing its ties with the BJP-led NDA.</p>
      <p>After the BJP expressed its inability to form the government in Maharashtra, the Governor had asked the Shiv Sena, the second-largest party after the last month’s elections, to indicate its willingness and ability to form the government.</p>
      <p>His son Aditya Thackeray later told reporters that he had met the Governor and expressed his party’s willingness to form the government and sought the extension of another 48 hours from him.</p>
      <p>However, Gover Bhagat Singh Koshyari refused to give the Shiv Sena the extension the party requested for. NCP’s Ajit Pawar said that Uddhav Thackeray had called Sharad Pawar informing him about the Governor’s decision and his party will hold talks with the Congress on Tuesday to take a final call on the matter.</p>
