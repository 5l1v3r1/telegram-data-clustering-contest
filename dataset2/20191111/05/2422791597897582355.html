      <p>NEW GLASGOW, N.S. -- Brad Jacobs defended his Tour Challenge championship by beating Brad Gushue 6-4 on Sunday for his fifth Grand Slam title.</p>
      <p>Jacobs, from Sault Ste. Marie, Ont., never led until the seventh end, but kept it close enough to make his move when the opportunity arrived.</p>
      <p>Gushue, of St. John's, N.L., was up 4-2 in the seventh but left an opening for Jacobs, who scored three for his first lead of the draw. Jacobs added a single in the eighth to seal the win.</p>
      <p>It was only the first loss at the tournament for Gushue, who went undefeated through round robin.</p>
      <p>Earlier, reigning Olympic champion Anna Hasselborg of Sweden topped Kerri Einarson of Winnipeg 8-5 to win the women's title at the Tour Challenge.</p>
      <p>Hasselborg scored three apiece in the third and sixth ends for a 7-3 lead and held on from there to earn the win at the second Grand Slam of Curling event of the season.</p>
