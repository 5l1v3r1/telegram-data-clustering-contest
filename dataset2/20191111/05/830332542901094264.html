      <p>NEW YORK - Investors have recently put fears about the pace of global growth aside, opting for optimism on a "phase one" US-China trade deal. But muted economic data expected out of Europe this week could change the mood.</p>
      <p>Germany may post data Thursday indicating that it's <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/19/economy/germany-recession-bundesbank/index.html">in recession</a>. Economists surveyed by Reuters believe the world's fourth largest economy shrank 0.1% between July and September — marking two straight quarters of negative growth.</p>
      <p>It's possible that Germany — which has been hit by the trade war, as well as falling global demand for autos — just dodged a bullet. Exports unexpectedly rebounded in September, rising 1.5% compared to the previous month. August data was also revised upward.</p>
      <p>"With today's data, a technical recession is not yet a done deal," Carsten Brzeski, ING's chief German economist, told clients, noting that Germany could have avoided another contraction "at the very last minute."</p>
      <p>Recession or not, the reality is that Germany's economy, the largest in Europe, looks very weak. A reminder of that could give investors a jolt.</p>
      <p>"The fact remains that the German economy has been in de facto stagnation for more than a year," Brzeski said. "This is clearly nothing to become too cheerful about."</p>
      <p>The United Kingdom will report GDP data on Monday. The country's economy <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/09/economy/uk-gdp-brexit/index.html">shrank for the first time</a> since 2012 in the second quarter as global growth and Brexit fears loomed large — but economists polled by Reuters think the country will narrowly avoid a recession by notching 0.4% growth between July and September.</p>
      <p>Also on the calendar is Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's testimony before Congress on the US economy, which takes place Wednesday and Thursday.</p>
      <p>Expect Powell to get grilled on where the Fed goes after <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/30/economy/federal-reserve-rate-decision-october/index.html">three straight "insurance" cuts</a> to interest rates. But he's also likely to face questions on weak manufacturing and business investment data — and what it tells us about the strength of the world's biggest economy.</p>
