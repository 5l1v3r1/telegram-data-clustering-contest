        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya Nov 11- Pressure is piling on President Uhuru Kenyatta to stop supporting the upcoming ICPD25+ conference that promotes formations of pro-abortion legislation in Africa.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A non-Governmental Organisation Citizen Go was set to hold protests in Nairobi on Monday and deliver over 68,000 signatures to the Office of the President at Harambee House against the conference set to take place in Nairobi from Tuesday.</p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>“This delivery of signatures, launched by CitizenGO is part of a protest since last October, to condemn the influence of the United Nations and other institutions that will encourage legislation all over Africa to promote abortion,” said Ann Kioko, the Campaign’s Director for Africa, Ann Kioko.</p>
      <p>The organisation has publicly denounced the UN’s partnership with international pro-abortion groups such as International Planned Parenthood Federation, Marie Stopes, Rutgers, and IPAS to fund pro-abortion activities and the push for Comprehensive Sexuality Education in countries like Kenya, Uganda, Ghana, Malawi, and Nigeria.</p>
      <p>“This conference in Nairobi will be the epitome of their efforts to force their destructive agenda on Africa,” she said in a statement to newsrooms ahead of the protest march.</p>
      <p>Apart from this delivery, she said, the international platform CitizenGO has put in motion an online campaign called ‘Reject Pro-Abortion and Sexualization Agenda at ICPD25+ Nairobi Summit.’</p>
      <p>The protest was set to take place even as Deputy President William Ruto assured Christians that the government would not allow the introduction of practices that contradict the teachings of the Bible.</p>
      <p>“We would stand firm as leaders to oppose any teachings and issues that go against our stand as Christians,” he said.</p>
      <p>During the last conference in 1994 in Cairo, ICPD adopted a landmark plan that sought to advance human well-being by placing the rights of individuals at the centre of the global development agenda.</p>
      <p>Ruto, who spoke on Sunday at the Covenant Church International Enkongu Enkare in Naroosura, Narok County, said Kenya must stand with religious values.</p>
