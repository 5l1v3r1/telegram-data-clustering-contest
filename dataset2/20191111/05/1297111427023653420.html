      <p>The <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/rob-vanstone-saskatchewan-roughriders-fans-should-root-for-winnipeg-blue-bombers-on-sunday">Saskatchewan Roughriders</a> will face the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in the CFL’s West Division final on Nov. 17 at Mosaic Stadium.</p>
      <p>Winnipeg advanced to the next round of the playoffs by defeating the host Calgary Stampeders 35-14 in the West semi-final at McMahon Stadium on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The Bombers’ starting quarterback, Zach Collaros, began the 2019 season as Saskatchewan’s No. 1 pivot. He suffered a concussion early in the regular-season opener and, after the emergence of <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-being-cautious-with-quarterback-cody-fajardo">Cody Fajardo</a>, was traded to the Toronto Argonauts and subsequently dealt to Winnipeg.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Chris Streveler, playing hurt, also made significant contributions behind centre for the Blue Bombers. He rushed 13 times for 82 yards, including a 24-yard TD.</p>
      <p>Calgary quarterback Bo Levi Mitchell had a miserable day, going 12-for-28 for 116 yards, with one touchdown and three interceptions before 24,278 spectators at McMahon Stadium.</p>
      <p>Mitchell did not register a passing yard in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>“I just didn’t make the throws when I had to,” Mitchell said during a post-game media conference.</p>
      <p>After Calgary went ahead 14-5 in the second quarter, Winnipeg scored 30 unanswered points.</p>
      <p>Saskatchewan finished first in the West, with a 13-5 record, and received a first-round playoff bye. Winnipeg (11-7) placed third before dethroning the defending Grey Cup champions, who finished 12-6.</p>
      <p>Winnipeg and Saskatchewan have not met in the West final since 1972, when the visitors rallied from a 24-7 deficit to win 27-24 at Winnipeg Stadium on a last-play field goal by Jack Abendschan.</p>
      <p>Saskatchewan has not played Winnipeg at home in a division final since 1966, when a best-of-three series began at Taylor Field. The Riders won the opener 14-7 before prevailing 21-19 in Winnipeg three days later. <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/the-roughriders-first-grey-cup-win-robs-green-time-machine">Saskatchewan went on to win the Grey Cup for the first time.</a></p>
      <p>The Roughriders and Bombers are meeting at Mosaic Stadium for the second consecutive year in the playoffs. On Nov. 11, 2018, Winnipeg won 23-18 during a game that Collaros was forced to miss due to a concussion. Brandon Bridge started at quarterback in his place.</p>
      <p>The winner of the West final will advance to the Grey Cup, Nov. 24 in Calgary, against the winner of the East final between the Hamilton Tiger-Cats and the visiting Edmonton Eskimos.</p>
      <p>Edmonton, a cross-over participant in the East playoffs, defeated the host Montreal Alouettes 37-29 on Sunday.</p>
