      <p>Aulas was furious and threatened to boycott the fixture, which kicked-off before a Marseille record crowd of just over 65,000 fans.</p>
      <p>"We're not taking it anymore," said Aulas. "It was a trap and if there's the slightest thing more we won't play."</p>
      <p>Regional newspaper La Provence said the shaken passengers described being terrified.</p>
      <p>"We were bombarded with stones, bottles and other projectiles. It's a disgrace, it's just sick," La Provence reported an unidentified passenger of the bus saying.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the evening around 6,000 fans had gathered at a city beach to perform a short but boisterous ceremonial parade toward their Velodrome stadium to celebrate the 120th anniversary of the creation of the club.</p>
