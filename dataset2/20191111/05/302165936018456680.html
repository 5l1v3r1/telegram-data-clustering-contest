      <p>PETALING JAYA, Nov 11 — K-pop star Son Na-eun has stopped pursuing legal action against a cyberbully after discovering that the suspect suffers from a mental illness.</p>
      <p>The Apink member’s management label Play M Entertainment had initially filed a criminal complaint on her behalf against someone who was leaving malicious comments on her social media profiles.</p>
      <p>In an act of empathy and kindness, Son dropped the charges after it was revealed that the person was undergoing treatment for mental health issues.</p>
      <p>According to South Korean news portal <i>Special Economy</i>, a spokesperson from the law firm Wooree said that the suspect’s relatives had already apologised to Son for the hateful comments.</p>
      <p>“The suspect’s family apologised sincerely to Son Na-eun and her agency, and after hearing of the suspect’s unfortunate circumstances and the sincere apology from their family, Son Na-eun has decided this once to forgive them.</p>
      <p>“Apink and the members have been through a lot of hurt because of malicious comments, and their agency and our law firm took a strong response by requesting a thorough investigation,” said the Wooree representative, based on translations by <i>Soompi</i>.</p>
      <p>The suspect was reportedly a law student at a top-ranking university in South Korea and had buckled under pressure due to exams.</p>
      <p>The individual is currently being treated for mental illness at a hospital.</p>
      <p>Despite letting the person off, Wooree emphasised that Play M Entertainment will continue to take stern action against keyboard warriors targeting Son and her fellow Apink members.</p>
      <p>Son was previously the subject of criticism in February last year for having a phone case that read: "Girls can do anything".</p>
      <p>Social media users accused the 25-year-old of promoting feminism, a controversial topic in South Korea where patriarchal ideals remain prevalent.</p>
