      <p>A group of mums have set up a baby food bank to help families in need of supplies this Christmas.</p>
      <p>The women, who already run a breakfast club at the local Salvation Army hall in Glasgow, have decided to extend their services to help even more families.</p>
      <p>They are appealing for donations of stage one formula, nappies, baby wipes, baby food for six months plus, breast pads and toiletries.</p>
      <p>Two health visitors will also help the mums, from the Springburn area, with the service.</p>
      <p>The idea for the baby food bank came about after a local mum couldn't breastfeed her eight-week-old baby after suffering from seizures.</p>

      <p>She was hospitalised but the family weren't entitled to any benedits.</p>
      <p>One of the organisers told the <a href="https://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/18026101.baby-food-bank-help-north-glasgow-families-need-time-christmas/">Evening Times:</a> "A group of us mums who help to run a school breakfast club rallied around and phoned many of our contacts.</p>
      <p>"After a social media plea, we had some donations of items which could be passed onto the family."</p>
      <p>The baby food bank will operate on a a referral basis as there are strict guidelines on some items such as formula.</p>

      <p>Another organiser added: "This system will be used on a health visitor referral only as every child in Glasgow has a health visitor so they know their needs."</p>
      <p>The Salvation Army has given the group space to store donations which can be collected.</p>
      <p>Drop-offs will also take place at Springburn Parish Church and the local community council.</p>
