      <h1>Tyson Fury claims he gets mistaken for Brad Pitt and George Clooney 'all the time'</h1>
      <h2>Lineal heavyweight champion and WWE star says women hit on him everywhere he goes</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T05:39:46+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 05:39</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Tyson Fury has claimed women "hit on him" everywhere he goes - and not just because he's a world-famous boxer.</p>
      <p>The lineal heavyweight champion says he is up there with the likes of heart-throbs Brad Pitt and George Clooney.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tyson-fury">Fury</a> has been raising his profile of late, making appearances in WWE as well as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/other-sports/mma/tyson-fury-trains-ufc-star-20848333">teasing a potential transition from boxing into MMA</a> .</p>
      <p>The self-styled 'Gypsy King' - who is married to Paris, mum to their five children - is famous on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
      <p>But he said he even gets plenty of female attention when he goes to countries where he is not known as a boxer.</p>

      <p>“Do women hit on me? All the time!" said Fury in quotes reported by the <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/tyson-fury-admits-gets-more-20855048">Daily Star</a> .</p>
      <p>"Everywhere I go. And not just because they know who I am.</p>
      <p>“Seriously, I could go to foreign countries where people don’t know me and they’re still hitting on me.</p>
      <p>"Because I’m tall, dark and handsome. Good dress sense. They’re like: ‘Who is this guy? Is he Brad Pitt? George Clooney?’”</p>

      <p>Fury also claims to wear a three-piece suit all the time - even at home when lounging around or doing night feeds and changing nappies.</p>
      <p>He said: "I’ve created a monster, haven’t I? I’ve created this flamboyant character, so now if I don’t turn up dressed the part, people are disappointed. It’s the brand. It’s just part of the job.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Fury has hinted <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/boxing/tyson-fury-vs-deontay-wilder-20857216">he may never again box in the UK</a> - casting doubt on potential future fights with the likes of Deontay Wilder and Anthony Joshua.</p>
      <p>Speaking from the US about the UK boxing scene, the Gypsy King told the <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/tyson-fury-interview-the-boxer-on-fighting-depression-and-his-inner-demons-g56wnztdr">Times</a> : "They had their chance.</p>
      <p>"They didn’t treat me well. Over here, I get treated like a superstar.”</p>
