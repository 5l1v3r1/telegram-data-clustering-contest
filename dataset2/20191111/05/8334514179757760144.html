      <p>TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s weather bureau said on Monday there is a 60% chance there will be no El Nino or La Nina from now through the northern hemisphere spring.</p>
      <p>El Nino is a warming of ocean surface temperatures in the eastern and central Pacific that typically happens every few years, sometimes causing crop damage, flash floods or fires.</p>
      <p>La Nina is characterised by unusually cold ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean region and is also linked with floods and drought.</p>
