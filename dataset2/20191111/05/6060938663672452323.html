      <p>MILAN: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/AS-Roma">AS Roma</a> lost third place in <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Serie-A">Serie A</a> when they slumped to a 2-0 defeat at <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Parma">Parma</a> after <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Mattia-Sprocati">Mattia Sprocati</a> and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Andreas-Cornelius">Andreas Cornelius</a> grabbed second-half goals on Sunday to end the visitors' six-match unbeaten league run.</p>
      <p>Roma, playing three days after a Europa League defeat by Borussia Moenchengladbach, nearly went ahead midway through the second period when Aleksandar Kolarov rattled the woodwork with a free kick and Javier Pastore's effort from the rebound was brilliantly saved by Luigi Sepe.</p>
      <p>Instead, Sprocati fired Parma ahead from Riccardo Gagliolo's cross in the 68th minute and Cornelius added a second on the break with the last move of the match.</p>
      <p>Roma were overhauled by free-scoring Lazio, who beat visiting Lecce 4-2, and Cagliari, who hammered Fiorentina 5-2 at home. Both have 24 points, followed by Atalanta and Roma on 22, Napoli with 19 and Parma who are eighth on 17.</p>
      <p>Five players shared Cagliari's goals as the Sardinians continued their impressive season - Marko Rog, Fabio Piscane, Giovanni Simeone, Joao Pedro and Radja Nainggolan, who also provided three assists.</p>
      <p>Dusan Vlahovic scored twice late on to make the score more respectable for Fiorentina.</p>
      <p>Serie A leading scorer Ciro Immobile took his tally to 14 this season by converting a penalty for Lazio.</p>
      <p>Joaquin Correa put Lazio ahead on the half hour and Gianluca Lapadula replied 10 minutes later.</p>
      <p>Sergei Milinkovic-Savic put Lazio back in front in the 62nd minute but then gave away a penalty five minutes later.</p>
      <p>Khouma Babacar saw his effort saved by Thomas Strakosha and although Gianluca Lapadula put the rebound in, it was disallowed for encroachment.</p>
      <p>Immobile made no mistake when Lazio were awarded a penalty to make it 3-1 and Correa then got his second for the hosts before Andrea La Mantia pulled one back for Lecce.</p>
      <p>Udinese goalkeeper Juan Musso saved a penalty from SPAL substitute Andrea Petagna in the eighth minute of stoppage time to rescue a 0-0 home draw for his side as the visitors moved off the bottom of the table.</p>
      <p>Claudio Ranieri's Sampdoria also managed a 0-0 draw at home to Atalanta who had Ruslan Malinovskyi sent off for a second bookable offence in the 74th minute.</p>
