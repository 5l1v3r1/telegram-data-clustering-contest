        <b>India's Test specialists, which includes the likes of Mayank Agarwal and Cheteshwar Pujara, have begun their pink-ball practice by hitting the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru. India will face off against Bangladesh in the country's first-ever Day/Night Test in Kolkata on November 22.</b>
      </p>
      <p>As India braces itself to host its first-ever pink-ball Test in Kolkata in a fortnight's time, the Test regulars have already begun their preparation for the same by having practice sessions at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru. The team's practice has also come under the supervision of the then Indian skipper and now NCA head <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/rahul_dravid">Rahul Dravid</a>.</p>
      <p>Several players, including <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/mayank_agarwal">Mayank Agarwal</a>, <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/cheteshwar_pujara">Cheteshwar </a><a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/pujara">Pujara</a>, vice-captain <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/ajinkya_rahane">Ajinkya Rahane</a>, Hanuma Vihari, <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/ravindra_jadeja">Ravindra Jadeja</a> and pacers <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/ishant_sharma">Ishant Sharma</a> and <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/mohammad_shami">Mohammad Shami</a> have hit the NCA nets in order to hone their skills with the pink-ball ahead of the country's inaugural Day/Night Test against Bangladesh later this month. </p>
      <p>Whilst some of these players do have prior experience in playing with the pink ball, thanks to the Day/Night matches they played in the <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/tournament/duleep_trophy">Duleep Trophy</a>, playing with the pink-ball in international cricket is expected to be a whole different ballgame altogether and thus the team has decided to put some hard yards in to be well prepared for the encounter. A notable absentee from the team, however, is skipper <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/virat_kohli">Virat Kohli</a>, who is still on his break. Kohli is expected to join the team in the next few days.</p>
      <p>India will face Bangladesh in their first-ever pink-ball Test at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata on November 22. </p>
