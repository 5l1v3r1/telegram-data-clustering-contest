      <p>It’s been over two months since <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/kevin-hart/">Kevin Hart</a> <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/kevin-hart-reportedly-suffers-serious-injury-in-car-accident.html">suffered serious injuries</a> in an early morning car accident outside L.A., and while his representative said Hart won’t be fully back in action until 2020, the actor and comedian was able to make an appearance at E!’s <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/people's-choice-awards/">People’s Choice Awards</a> on Sunday to accept the Comedy Act of 2019 award, presented by <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/robert-downey-jr./">Robert Downey Jr.</a></p>
      <p>“First and foremost, thank God because I definitely don’t have to be here,” Hart told the audience. “Being that I am, it makes me appreciate life even more. It makes me appreciate the things that really matter. Family. I want to thank my wife and my kids, who really stepped up to the plate for me.” </p>
      <p>Following the September 1 crash, Hart required major back surgery and was hospitalized for ten days, before transferring to a rehabilitation facility to recover. While the driver of the car Jared Black also suffered serious injuries, the other passenger Rebecca Broxterman was reportedly unharmed. “You have no idea the effect that you have on us as entertainers,” the comedian told his fans. “Your energy. Your support. It means the world, and I truly want to thank you guys for being there for me in my difficult time.” </p>
