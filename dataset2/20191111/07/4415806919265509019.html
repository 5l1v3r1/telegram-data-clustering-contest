      <h1>Years of roadworks on horizon for M11 users, as third lane proposed</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T07:38:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 07:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>Commuters heading into Dublin face years of road works as a third lane is proposed for the M11.</p>
      <p>Traffic volumes along the stretch have almost doubled over the last two decades.</p>
      <p>A second phase of public consultation is to get underway tomorrow on proposals for a major upgrade of the road between the m50/m11 merge and Coyne's Cross in Wicklow according to the Irish Times.</p>
      <p>Since the Glen of the Downs was widened, the number of cars has risen from 25,000 a day in 1999 to 53,000 last year - swelling to 78,000 when it hits the Dublin border.</p>
      <p>A third lane has been proposed in plans, running for 10kms from the m50 merge to south of Kilmacanogue.</p>
      <p>It would also see a redesign of junctions and the closure of a number of access roads.</p>
      <p>There are also calls for an express bus lane to be added.</p>
