      <h1>India smartphone shipments rise 9.3% in Q3; Xiaomi leads the list</h1>
      <h2>Xiaomi continued to lead the tally with 27.1% share, followed by Samsung (18.9%), Vivo (15.2%), Realme (14.3%) and Oppo (11.8%).</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T07:25:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 07:25</time> by <a rel="author">Press Trust of India</a></address>
      <p>Multiple online sales festivals, new launches and price corrections on a few key models by brands helped <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/smartphone-shipments">smartphone shipments </a>in India grow 9.3 per cent in the July-September quarter to touch record 46.6 million units, research firm IDC said on Monday.</p>
      <p>Sequentially, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/smartphone-shipments">Smartphone shipments </a>were higher by 26.5 per cent in the third quarter ended September 2019 compared to the previous quarter. IDC expects the smartphone market to see only mid-to-high single-digit year-on-year growth in 2019.</p>
      <p>"This can be attributed to a strong undercurrent of passive consumer sentiment and muted shipments in the last quarter of the year due to a record Q3 2019 when channel stock levels went up," IDC India Research Director (Client Devices and IPDS) Navkendar Singh said.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the unabated aggression of the online players will continue to be a challenge for the offline channel, which remains the largest channel for smartphones in India, he added.</p>
      <p>"All these give us an indication of sluggish growth next quarter," Singh said.</p>
      <p>The feature phone market, which accounted for 43.3 per cent of the total mobile phone shipments, registered a 17.5 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) decline in the September 2019 quarter to 35.6 million units.</p>
      <p>Shipments of 4G-enabled feature phones declined 20.3 per cent y-o-y due to heavy inventory in the channel, while that of the 2G and 2.5G market fell 16.2 per cent in the said quarter, IDC said.</p>
      <p>"The continued aggression by the online platforms with attractive cashback and buyback offers as well as affordability schemes like no-cost EMIs (equated-monthly instalments) and financing options were key in taking the share of the online channel to a record high of 45.4 per cent with y-o-y growth of 28.3 per cent," IDC India Associate Research Manager (Client Devices) Upasana Joshi said.</p>
      <p>According to IDC, the offline channel "continued to face challenges", leading to a 2.6 per cent y-o-y decline in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>Even as the offline channel players tried to match their offers in line with the online players, they fell short of the attractive deals that a consumer could grab in the online space and were still dealing with leftover inventory from previous quarters, the report said.</p>
      <p>Consumer enquiries and footfall were relatively slow at the retail counters through September, compared to the previous years, it added.</p>
      <p>Xiaomi continued to lead the tally with 27.1 per cent share, followed by Samsung (18.9 per cent), <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-vivo">Vivo </a>(15.2 per cent), <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-realme">Realme </a>(14.3 per cent) and Oppo (11.8 per cent).</p>
      <p>The average selling price for the overall smartphone market was $ 159, up 2.7 per cent y-o-y.</p>
      <p>The low-end price segment of $ 200 accounted for 80 per cent of the smartphone market in the September quarter, while the mid-range segment ($ 200-500) contributed 18.9 per cent of the shipments.</p>
      <p>The fastest-growing segment was the $ 300-500 with double the shipments y-o-y as models like the OnePlus 7, Xiaomi Redmi K20 Pro and <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-vivo">Vivo </a>V15 Pro saw good traction, IDC said.</p>
      <p>The premium (over $ 500) segment saw Apple continuing to dominate the market with a share of 51.3 per cent on the back of "affordability offers and price drops on previous generation models".</p>
