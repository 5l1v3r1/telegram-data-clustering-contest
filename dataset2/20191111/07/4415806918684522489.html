      <p>A number of Government Ministers will today meet and brief workers affected by the planned closure of ESB power stations at Lanesboro and Shannon Bridge.</p>
      <p>The ESB said it submitted an application to An Bord Pleanála in 2018 seeking planning permission to transition West Offaly Power from peat to biomass over a number of years starting in 2020. However, the planning application was rejected by An Bord Pleanála in July of this year.</p>
      <p>Up to 90 workers are believed to be affected by the planned closures.</p>
      <p>Climate Action Minister Richard Bruton is travelling to the Midlands today along with Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe, Heritage Minister Josepha Madigan and Minister of State for the OPW, Kevin Boxer Moran.</p>
      <p>The Government recently announced the creation of a €6m Just Transition Fund for the Midlands, and the ESB has announced that it will make an additional contribution of €5m to the fund.</p>
      <p>Minister Bruton said the Government is determined to show solidarity and comittment to support communities during the transition away from peat.</p>
      <p>"In the Budget we set aside significant funds, we have achieved support from the European Union PSO subsidy system to support bog rehabilitation, and we've appointed Kieran Mulvey as a just transition commissioner.</p>
      <p>"We need to work on the changes we can put in place that will allow the Midlands make a transition from the brown past, if you like, to the green future."</p>
      <p>"The Government is determined to show solidarity and a commitment to a just transition," he said.</p>
      <p>"We want to sit down with workers and wider interests in the Midlands region to discuss how we're going to manage this and achieve a just transiton."</p>
