      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 11 — A viral video post on social media recently claiming that a barge containing bauxite had sunk in the waters of Kuantan is no more than false information, says Lynas Malaysia Sdn Bhd (Lynas).</p>
      <p>In a statement, Lynas pointed out the Kuantan Port had clarified that the accident did not occur in Malaysian waters and the material contained in the barge is nickel ore, and not bauxite.</p>
      <p>“Lynas does not mine or produce bauxite ore. Bauxite and nickel ore are not rare earth and Lynas does not mine any materials in Malaysia,” the statement said.</p>
      <p>Lynas added all material imported and exported from the Lynas plant is packaged in containers.</p>
      <p>“The commentary being pushed on social media continues a pattern of disinformation promoted by anti-Lynas activists over many years.</p>
      <p>“We are disappointed to see that a small group of activists continue to spread misinformation about Lynas Malaysia and are causing fear and confusion among the community,” the statement said. — Bernama</p>
