      <h1>Bitcoin ‘Is Not Real,’ Says Former European Central Bank Chief</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T07:39:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 07:39</time> by <a rel="author">Adrian Zmudzinski</a></address>
      <p>Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) lacks the characteristics of a currency and is purely speculative, according to the European Central Bank’s former president Jean-Claude Trichet. Chinese news outlet South China Morning Post <a href="https://www.scmp.com/print/business/banking-finance/article/3037099/bitcoin-not-real-and-any-purchase-amounts-speculation-says">reported</a> on Nov. 10 that Trichet made remarks at Caixin’s conference in Beijing.</p>
      <h3>“I am strongly against Bitcoin”</h3>
      <p>During the event, Trichet also expressed doubt that cryptocurrencies could ever become the future of money. He said that Bitcoin lacks the characteristics of a real currency:</p>
      <blockquote>“I am strongly against Bitcoin, and I think we are a little complacent. [...] The currency itself is not real, with the characteristics that a currency must have.”</blockquote>
      <p>Trichet also explained that he believes buying cryptocurrency is, in many respects, just speculation. He also claimed that even when a crypto asset is supposedly backed by a real asset, he still observes a lot of speculation, which he concluded is “not healthy.”</p>
      <h3>Trichet prefers SDR to Libra</h3>
      <p>Trichet added that he’s also not a fan of Facebook’s proposed <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/libra">Libra</a> stablecoin and noted that he, unsurprisingly, prefers the Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) issued by the International Monetary Fund. </p>
      <p>Similarly to Libra’s plans, SDRs are backed by a basket of currencies, including the U.S. dollar, the euro, the pound sterling, renminbi and yen. He explained:</p>
      <blockquote>“I have great doubts of keeping control of monetary value in [the cryptocurrency] domain. [...] In the so-called new stable international currencies […] the SDR would be the right basket.”</blockquote>
      <p>Trichet also said that, while the world may be leaving banknotes and coins behind, cryptocurrencies could not be the way forward.</p>
      <p>As Cointelgraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ecb-president-stablecoins-and-crypto-not-suitable-money-substitutes">reported</a> in September, another former European Central Bank president Mario Draghi echoed Trichet saying that cryptocurrencies and even stablecoins “are not designed in ways that make them suitable substitutes for money.”</p>
