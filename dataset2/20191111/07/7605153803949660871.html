        <b>LONDON, United Kingdom, Nov 11<i> – </i>French striker Alexandre Lacazette has leaped to the defence of under-fire Arsenal manager Unai Emery saying fans were being fickle in criticising him after not praising him when they were on a good run last season.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The pressure on the 48-year-old Spaniard grew with a 2-0 defeat by Leicester on Saturday, leaving the Gunners with just one win in their last six Premier League games and eight points off fourth place and a Champions League qualification spot.</p>
      <p>Emery has also had to deal with the fallout from Granit Xhaka’s emotional outburst towards supporters when he was substituted against Crystal Palace a fortnight ago. The Spaniard eventually stripped the Swiss international of the captaincy.</p>
      <p>Lacazette, though, said while the players’ confidence had dipped the present international break gives them a chance to recharge their batteries ahead of their game at home to struggling Southampton on November 24.</p>
      <p>“Last season when we were unbeaten in 20 games in a row nobody said anything about the coach or manager,” said Lacazette.</p>
      <p>“We miss confidence and we need the international break.</p>
      <p>“I hope we are going to come back well. We want to be top four, of course.</p>
      <p>“Now we are nine points behind Chelsea and Leicester and it is going to be hard, but everything is possible in football.”</p>
