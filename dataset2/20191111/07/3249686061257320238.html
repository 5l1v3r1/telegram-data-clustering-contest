      <p><a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/moon-hee-jun">Moon Hee Jun</a> has just undergone a huge weight loss!</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/hot">H.O.T</a> member recently lost 17kg (roughly 37 lbs.) and shared a number of photos of his weight loss transformation. While he is known for having 'yo-yo' dieted on and off throughout the years, he is calling it his 'final diet,' insisting that this time the weight loss is for good.</p>
      <p>When discussing his weight loss with the press, Moon Hee Jun admitted that he has 'yo-yo' dieted roughly 38 times in his life, having tried a variety of different weight loss methods. However, the diet strategies would become more and more extreme every time. His health suffered as a result, experiencing severe dizziness and a lack of energy.<br/><br/>However, this time around, he worked with diet and exercise professionals who were able to bring his weight down from 85kg (187 lbs.) to 68kg (150 lbs.), returning to a weight much closer to that of when he first debuted.<i><br/><br/>"Whenever I diet, I exercise hard or strictly cut out carbohydrates, but this time, I regularly made sure to eat three meals a day and even without working out as much as I used to, I lost weight a lot better. It was really exciting,"</i> he revealed, adding that he did not experience the dizziness and his health improved a lot. <i>"Now I plan to work on maintaining my weight, so I don't have to 'yo-yo' again."</i></p>
