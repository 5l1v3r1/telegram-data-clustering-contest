      <p>BOYLE HEIGHTS, LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- Two arrests were made in connection with a shooting that left a 17-year-old boy dead in Boyle Heights.<br/><br/>Ricardo Ramirez was shot in the head early Saturday morning as he stood in the intersection of Wabash and Evergreen avenues, according to the Los Angeles Police Department. A memorial was growing at the site, overflowing with candles and flowers.<br/><br/>Investigators believe the shooting was gang-related but it's unclear if the teen victim was involved. Ramirez's girlfriend, Sarah Vidovic, says he was an innocent victim.<br/><br/>Vidovic said she spoke to Ramirez Friday night as he walked home from work, minutes before he was gunned down.<br/><br/>"He was innocent, completely, not a part of any gangs, nothing. I think he was just caught in the crossfire or maybe mistaken for somebody else," she said.<br/><br/>Ramirez worked at a restaurant as a dishwasher but his goal was to become a chef.<br/><br/>Joshua Gomez, 23, and a 16-year-old male juvenile were taken into custody.<br/><br/>A motive for the shooting had not yet been determined.</p>
