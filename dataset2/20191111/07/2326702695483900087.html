      <p>We recently <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/msi-gungnir-100-mid-tower-pc-case-review/">reviewed the excellent MSI GUNGNIR 100</a>, which was named after Odin’s spear. MSI looks keen to follow that trend too, with their new SEKIRA 500G PC Case, which takes its name from the Axe of Perun, the most powerful &amp; highest God in Pantheon. That’s a pretty bold name for a product, and clearly, it has to live up to a high standard because of that. Fortunately, it looks like <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/msi">MSI</a> has gone all out on the SEKIRA. This is one of the most high-end and premium cases they’ve ever created, and that’s really saying something.</p>
      <h3>MSI MPG SEKIRA 500G</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>It’s really not mucking about when it comes to features. It features a removable radiator mounting bracket system, as well as water cooling support in general. There are tool-free hinged and removable side panels and glass, vertical graphics card mounting, high-quality pre-installed fans. The list goes on and on. However, aside from the fantastic hardware support, it’ll be the jaw-dropping design that has MSI fans flocking to the SEKIRA.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>Features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Mid-Tower with support for EATX/ ATX / micro ATX / Mini-ITX Motherboards featuring a Golden Edge with brushed aluminium chassis</li>
        <li>Two hinged swing-doors with premium-quality 4mm thick tempered glass design guarantees window durability and viewing capability</li>
        <li>Two 200mm fans aligned vertically on the front &amp; one 120mm fan on the rear to draw in air evenly across the entire face of the enclosure and make sure the rising warm air will always be exhausted with the rear and top airflow.</li>
        <li>Custom Liquid Cooling Ready features an extractable radiator bracket which supports for radiators up to 360mm in length</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What MSI Had to Say</h3>
      <blockquote>“The MPG SEKIRA 500G is the most innovative, sophisticated and customizable gaming chassis inspired by the Axe of Perun, the most powerful &amp; highest God in Pantheon. Its sharp, chiseled edges and the tilted slash across the facade reflect the power of the Axe of Perun while terminating the wickedness &amp; evil for justice.”</blockquote>
      <h3>MPG SEKIRA 500 Trailer</h3>

      </figure>
      <h3>Exterior</h3>
      <p>The MSI MPG SEKIRA 500G is a premium PC case inside and out. Of course, at a little over £200, it needs to be a quality product to justify its lofty price tag. Fortunately, even from the first look after taking it out of the box, it really does fill me with confidence. It features a large tempered glass window down the left side, with a little black trim on the edges of the glass to keep things looking tidy.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191106_103505.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Airflow all comes from the massive ventilated sections that run along the sides of the case at the top, front and bottom. They have this beautifully perforated metal mesh and a bank of dust filters behind them.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191106_103514-880x572.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>This is the 500 “G” too, which means it comes with a beautiful gold trim edge. It looks more like a rose-gold to me, it’s quite a warm almost brass-like colour. However, it contrasts with the black brushed aluminium with stunning effect. Furthermore, it matches up with the other black and gold hardware in the MSI range; GPUs, motherboard, etc.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191106_103533-880x578.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Upon the top of the case, you’ll find a massive piece of black brushed aluminium. It looks stunning, and it no doubt has quite a hand in the bigger asking price, as this isn’t a small case and that’s a lot of aluminium.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191106_103540-880x550.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Cut into the top panel, you’ll find a beautiful integrated I/O panel. All the usual things are here, power buttons, lighting controls, and a load of USB 3.0 ports, including a Type C.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191106_103602-880x478.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>They all have that machined gold edge just like the rest of the case, which makes it look even better.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191106_103638-880x571.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The front panel is even more impressive though. Yet again, another massive slab of black brushed aluminium that just oozes quality. This case has some serious presence and no doubt that anyone who owns it will want it somewhere it can be seen.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191106_103651-880x857.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>There’s a decal on the front in matching gold too. Albeit, this one is just flat, but damn would it have looked good if CNC’d this in just like the gold trim edges.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191106_103838-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>It’s a stunning front panel, but the good looks just keep on coming. As we move around to the right side, you’ll see it looks just like the left side!</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191106_103828-880x675.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Yup, another big hinged tempered glass window on this side too. So it doesn’t matter which side you’re looking from, the SEKIRA 500G is going to wow you.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191106_103733-880x722.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Around the back, you can see the motherboard I/O cutout. There’s a 120mm fan pre-installed here, although it will accept a 140mm fitting too. There’s a lot of space from the motherboard to the top of the case too; handy for those builds that need room for radiators!</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191106_103913-880x615.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Further down, we have eight expansion slots, giving you options for a bunch of expansion cards, multiple graphics cards etc. There’s a removable bracket on the right too, which can open up into a two-slot vertical GPU mount. However, you will need your own riser cable to do this.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191106_103916-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Also, towards the bottom, you’ll find the ATX PSU mount. Nothing crazy, just your usual PSU mount really.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191106_103920-880x654.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Below that, you’ll find a huge slide-out dust filter too, ensuring the PSU has all the clean airflow it needs.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191106_103931-880x743.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Interior</h3>
      <p>The tempered glass windows are mounted on hinges. Simply pull the handle and open it up, it’s that easy. If you need to quickly clean or make a change in your rig, you don’t have to reach for the screwdriver.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191106_103957-880x747.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Furthermore, the hinges at the back allow you to simply lift the glass up and off the case. Just put them to the side and they won’t get in your way while installing your hardware.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191106_104347-880x555.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The interior of the SEKIRA 500G is absolutely massive. It’s a high-end case for high-end hardware, so you’ll be happy to see it support E-ATX motherboard, huge graphics cards and much more. Plus, there’s a big cut-out for mounting the CPU cooler, as well pre-installed motherboard standoffs to speed up the process.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191106_104011-880x868.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>I love a good PSU shroud, and this one is a bit of a beast. Not only does it hide the PSU and all your cable gore, but it is also packed with HDD mounts. There are four tool-free 3.5″ trays in the bottom section and two more on a movable bracket towards the front. Plus, they’re all accessible from both sides of the case, which is handy.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191106_104016-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>If that’s not enough, there’s an SSD mount on top, two huge cable grommets, and the standoffs for mounting a vertical GPU riser cable!</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191106_104020-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Of course, you can also mount SSDs in these too using the screws that come included in the box.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191106_104041-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>For cable routing, you’ll find plenty of large cable grommets around the motherboard too. They’re set a little further to the right than most, allowing for the slightly wider E-ATX motherboards.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191106_104055-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Worried about airflow? I wouldn’t if I were you. There are two lovely 200mm fans mounted in the front that will move some serious air. Bigger fans mean higher airflow at lower RPM, and that means less noise too!</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191106_104101-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Plus, there are mounts for a wide range of 120/140 fittings to support any kind of fan and radiator configuration you desire. It’ll handle up to a 280mm in the front easily enough.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191106_104104-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Plus you can get a massive 360mm radiator in the top, or a 280mm if you want the larger fans. Furthermore, the whole top mounting bracket is on rails and fitting with thumbscrews.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191106_104113-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>This means you can completely remove it, fit your radiator and fans, then slide it back into place; nice and easy!</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191106_104118-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>In the rear, there’s another pre-installed fan. You’ll notice they’re not RGB or anything like that, just good quality blacked out fans.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191106_104127-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Behind the motherboard, there’s plenty of room for routing your cables. Of course, there is a window on this side of the case, so you’ll want to keep things neat and tidy. Thankfully, there are able tie-down loops, velcro straps, and that PSU shroud to help you do just that.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191106_104254-880x773.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>While the HDD cages are integrated into the shroud, they can be removed. This will be handy to deal with cable routing, radiator installs, that kind of thing. Basically, if something is in your way, you can move it if you need to.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191106_104259-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Plus if all those drive mounts aren’t enough for you, you’ll find two more SSD mounts tucked back here also!</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191106_104308-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Complete System</h3>
      <p>Honestly, building a PC inside the SEKIRA 500G was an absolute joy. It’s by far one of the nicest cases I’ve ever had the pleasure of working with, and after several hundred of them under my belt, that’s saying something. Getting a clean build could not have been easier. Plus, the amount of space in here means that hardware compatibility was never an issue.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191106_120603-880x839.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Having all the HDD bays accessible from the front like this is excellent. Not that’s it’s hard to access either side of the case since it’s all tool-free anyway.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191106_120617-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Plus with the exposed SSD mounts, it’s easy to show off your favourite drives. I mean, it has tempered glass windows, so you’re bound to want to show off something!</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191106_120624-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>One thing that did amuse me was that even the RTX 2080, which is not a small card, fills around one half the length of the case. I love that MSI state you can fit a 400mm GPU, like anything like that even exists.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191106_120630-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>CPU cooler clearance was excellent too. It’ll handle up to 170mm, so it’ll fit my favourite cooler with plenty of room to spare; all hail the Noctua NH-D15S!</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191106_120640-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>There’s loads of room on all sides of the motherboard too. This is good news for those fitting radiators in the top and rear of the case. Of course, there would be a lot more clearance if using a custom loop, as you wouldn’t have a huge Noctua cooler in the way.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191106_120644-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>It really does look pretty in here, but let’s get the glass back on and step back a bit.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191106_120649-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>I mean, come on, if you don’t like how that looks, leave a comment below so I can point and laugh at you. It’s a big case, sure, but it still manages to look utterly elegant.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191106_120856-880x517.jpg"/>

      <h3>How Much Does it Cost?</h3>
      <p>The MSI MPG SEKIRA 500G Full-Tower Gaming PC Case is available right now for <a href="https://amzn.to/2CrEYUK">just £219.99</a>, which is pretty competitive really. That’s £10 cheaper than the Corsair 500D, and £20 cheaper than the Thermaltake View 71 TG RGB Plus, and the same price as the Phanteks Enthoo Primo. Make no mistake, there’s no shortage of bloody awesome PC cases when you drop this amount of coin on them. However, the SEKIRA has got everything going for it and can compete easily with anything else on the market right now.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Update: keep an eye on the Amazon price, as it’s actually just £189.98 on </b>

      <p>OK, so I know it’s hardly cheap for a PC case, but consider just how much PC case you are getting here. Just on surface area alone, the material costs vs a mid-tower are practically double. There’s a LOT of beautifully finished aluminium on the exterior. Plus, those rose-gold finished CNC cut edges ooze quality from every angle, and I doubt it was a cheap task getting them looking so good. You also get three high-quality fans pre-installed, and a pretty awesome case interior to boot.</p>
      <h3>Hardware</h3>
      <p>There’s not a lot this case cannot handle. You can fit up to a 140mm radiator in the rear, a 280/360mm radiator in the top, and up to a 280mm in the front. For those building a custom liquid-cooled system, it’s certainly got the capabilities to make something special. Personally, I think air cooling is the strongest setup here though for a slick workstation build. Those 200mm fans are superb and give great airflow through those massive side vents. Seriously, don’t be put off about the indirect airflow, there’s a LOT of ventilation wrapping around those tempered glass windows.</p>
      <p>Big motherboards, huge graphics card, massive amounts of HDD and SSD mounts. This is clearly a case that can handle enthusiast workstations for content creation just as well as it could handle the latest gaming setups.</p>
      <h3>Build Quality</h3>
      <p>The pictures in this review speak a thousand words to the quality, fit and finish MSI has poured into the SEKIRA. It’s a very well made case, and it’s the little details that stand out the most. There are no panel gaps on the tempered glass, and everything else is locked firmly in place. The dust filtering is properly tight, with no other big gaps in the airflow that are unfiltered. Even the front I/O panel looks amazing, with its CNC cut edges, a huge bank of USB ports, and more.</p>
      <h3>Should I Buy One?</h3>
      <p>Honestly, if you’re not drooling over the pictures of it and this review by now, it’s not the case for you. Personally, I damn near threw my wallet at the case the moment I opened the box. If you’re still reading this review, I suspect I won’t be the only one. It is certainly one of the best cases of the last few years.</p>
