      </p>
      <p>In the Catalan club's 4-1 win over Celta Vigo in LaLiga on Saturday, Messi opened the scoring with a calmly-taken penalty before finding the back of the net with two superbly-struck free-kicks.</p>
      <p>The Argentine has <a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/international/categories/messi-ronaldo-neymar-watch-1/lionel-messi-equals-cristiano-ronaldo-laliga-record/667157">now scored as many LaLiga hat-tricks as Cristiano Ronaldo</a> did during his time in Spain, and has also now scored four direct free-kicks in the past month of football.</p>
      <p>Celta coach Oscar Garcia was full of praise for the 32-year-old after the match, insisting the game would have been completely different had he not played.</p>

      <p>"With Messi, you never have the game under control," he said, according to <i>ESPN</i>.</p>
      <p>"He's uncontrollable, he throws all plans up in the air.</p>
      <p>"His efficiency from free-kicks is incredible, his percentages are so high. You can't avoid giving free-kicks away there, either. He alone changes games.</p>
      <p>"If he didn't play, it would have been very different. We could even have won this one.</p>
      <p>"He conditions everything. You know something could happen every time he has the ball, but when it's a set-play, you cannot control it."</p>
