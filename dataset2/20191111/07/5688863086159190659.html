        <b>Three first-class cricketers from Pakistan - fast bowler Haris Rauf and batsmen Mirza Ehsan Baig and Sohail Akhtar- have reportedly decided to fly out to Abu Dhabi to participate in the upcoming T10 league. However, the uncapped players are yet to get NOCs from the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). </b>
      </p>
      <p>According to a report by Sportstar, the three Pakistani players in question have decided to deny their services to their respective first-class teams, insisting their eagerness to play for a franchise in the T10 league in Abu Dhabi. The players said told their teams that they had no interest in red-ball cricket and want to become white-ball specialists.</p>
      <p>“These three players informed their teams in domestic first-class cricket after the national T20 championship that they couldn’t play any longer in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy as they were going to play for their Pakistan Super League franchise, Lahore Qalanders,” a source told Sportstar.</p>
      <p>“Basically all three told their coaches that they were not interested in red ball cricket and were white ball specialists and left their teams.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, since the T10 league is an event recognized by the <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/tournament/icc">ICC</a>, the players will need to produce NOCs before featuring in the event. The three players, who are flying out to play for the Qalanders team, will be able to fly to Abu Dhabi but cannot participate without official permission from the board.</p>
      <p>“The T10 league is a event recognized by the ICC so players have to show NOCs of their home boards to play in the event,” the source revealed.</p>
