      <p>HOLLYWOOD HILLS, LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- Fire crews worked through Sunday to gain control of a brush fire that broke out in the Hollywood Hills area Saturday afternoon, officials said.<br/><br/>Over 230 Los Angeles Fire Department air and ground personnel battled the blaze that broke out near 3694 North Barham Blvd.<br/><br/>The blaze scorched through 80 acres of brush and firefighters said they had reached 80% containment by Sunday evening.<br/><br/>The blaze was burning at a slow rate with no wind, according to LAFD. Officials said the fire, which was burning near Warner Bros. Studios, was moving away from structures and spreading toward Griffith Park.<br/><br/>Crews will continue to work through Monday as terrain was very steep and making for a challenging mop-up.<br/><br/>A massive column of thick smoke could be seen for several miles, from Santa Monica to the San Fernando Valley after the fire first broke out Saturday.</p>
