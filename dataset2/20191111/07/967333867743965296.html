      <p>A golden retriever and its smaller copy have been captured on video playing a fun little game, the only rule of which is to snatch away a branch from the other.</p>
      <p>At first, the pooch led in the game, agilely dodging from its bigger companion and not letting him get the coveted branch.</p>
      <p>However, the bigger doggo prevailed in the end, escaping from the playground with the prize in its mouth.</p>
