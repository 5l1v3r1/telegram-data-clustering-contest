The margin improved to 25.7 per cent from 25.6 per cent relative to last year.</p>
      <p>For Q2FY20, the company’s consolidated revenue grew 40 per cent YoY at Rs 84.7 crore. Net profit, too, rose 51 per cent at Rs 15.6 crore on YoY basis.</p>
      <p>The stock, which was trading at its highest level since its listing on August 8, 2019, has more than doubled against the issue price of Rs 745 per share.</p>
      <p>Affle is a global technology company with a proprietary consumer intelligence platform that delivers consumer engagement, acquisitions and transactions through relevant mobile advertising.</p>
      <p>"Growth in Affle’s consumer platform business was well supported by the overall consumer trends of greater time spent across connected devices, increased adoption of online payments and consistent growth in digital marketing spends across key industry verticals including e-commerce, food, travel, transport, entertainment/OTT/gaming, healthcare, BFSI/fintech, telecom and others," the management said in a statement.</p>

      <p>“We think the underlying macro is attractive in Affle’s key <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/markets">markets </a>(India &amp; SEA), where a large internet user base, rising smartphone sales, improving data connectivity and young demographics augur well for the shift to digital. Further, as advertisers shift to direct sourcing, ad tech vendors could retain a higher share of digital ad spends, implying faster growth for ad tech vendors,” analysts said in a report.</p>
