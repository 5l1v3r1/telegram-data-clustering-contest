      <p>REUTERS: Two first-half goals from Dimitri Payet gave Olympique de Marseille a stormy 2-1 win over bitter rivals Olympique Lyonnais, who complained that their team bus was pelted with missiles on the way to the Stade Velodrome on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The match, which saw Marseille go second in Ligue 1, was also interrupted for five minutes when a laser was shone at Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes and again in the second half because of smoke caused by pyrotechnics.</p>

      <p>Photographs showed windows on one side of the Lyon bus had been smashed and club president Jean-Michel Aulas at one point threatened to pull his team out of the match.</p>
      <p>"We were victims of an ambush," he told reporters. "If it continues like this, we will not play."</p>
      <p>French media said that Lyon insisted on using their highly customised and distinctive team bus despite being advised to use a more discreet vehicle.</p>
      <p>The match went ahead and there was more chaos after Marseille were awarded a penalty.</p>
      <p>First, Marseille forward Dario Benedetto appeared to push another player, leading to a VAR review over a possible red card, and then a laser beam was shone towards Lopes.</p>
      <p>Payet finally converted in the 18th minute, five minutes after the spot kick was awarded, as Marseille became the first team to score 4,000 goals in Ligue 1.</p>
      <p>The Reunion Island-born player struck again in the 39th minute after he won a tackle in midfield, found Lopez, collected the return and drilled his shot past Lopes.</p>
      <p>The game was stopped for smoke early in the second half and it was still clearing when Moussa Dembele headed in Bertrand Traore's pass to reduce the arrears.</p>
      <p>Marseille had Alvaro Gonzalez sent off five minutes later for a denying Dembele a clear scoring chance but the hosts held on to leave them with 22 points, eight behind leaders Paris St Germain.</p>
