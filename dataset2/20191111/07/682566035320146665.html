      <p>Liverpool - <b>Pep Guardiola</b> said his side showed why they were Premier League champions despite losing <b>3-1</b> to <b>Liverpool </b>at Anfield on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Liverpool took a huge step towards a first top-flight title in 30 years by opening an eight-point lead at the top of the table.</p>
      <p>Goals from Fabinho and Mohamed Salah gave the European champions a dream start before Sadio Mane's diving header early in the second half sealed City's fate.</p>
      <p>Bernardo Silva pulled a late goal back but a third defeat in eight league games leaves City down in fourth, nine points behind Liverpool, and with a mountain to climb if they are to claim a third straight league title.</p>
      <p>"What happened today we showed why are champion," Guardiola told Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>"I am so proud of my team, more than ever. We can be proud of how we played against the strongest team in Europe."</p>
      <p>"We played like back-to-back champions," he added. "We cannot deny how good Liverpool are but the way we played, the personality, it was good."</p>
