      <p>The AMD Radeon RX 5700 and RX 5700 XT <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/graphics-card/">graphics cards</a> certainly came as quite a surprise. Not only did AMD come out with some lovely new cards, but they’re very competitive on price and performance. The premium gaming division of <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/gigabyte/">Gigabyte</a> thinks they can do even better though.</p>
      <h3>AORUS RX 5700</h3>
      <p>They’ve <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/261038/gigabyte-radeon-rx-5700-series-aorus-render-revealed">released their first rendering</a> of what their high-end <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/aorus/">AORUS</a> Radeon RX 5700 would look like, and it looks stunning. Not unsurprisingly, it looks like a hybrid of the Gigabyte Windforce X3 with a bit of a futuristic twist.</p>
      <p>However, while the Windforce is a 2x slot card, the AORUS edition pushes that up to 3x slots deep. That means a much bigger heatsink being cooled by their triple fan configuration.</p>
      <p>Throw in plenty of little details, like the fact the centre fan spins the other way, some RGB, a black PCB, and a backplate, and you’re ready to rock.</p>
      <h3>Price and Availability</h3>
      <p>There’s no word on the price or the release date just yet. However, I suspect it’ll be out in time for CES 2020 in January. No doubt it’ll be a little more expensive, but we expect some massive factory overclocks too.</p>
