      <p>In a trading update this morning Greggs, which has 2,000 stores across the UK,  said it now anticipates 2019 full-year profit before tax, excluding exceptional charges, to be higher than previous expectations. </p>
      <p>“Sales growth continues to be driven by increased customer visits and has been stronger than we had expected given the improving comparative sales pattern that we saw in the fourth quarter last year,” the company said in a statement today.</p>
      <p>“Operational costs remain well controlled and, whilst the comparative sales become stronger still in the balance of the year, the Board now anticipates that full year underlying profit before tax (excluding exceptional charges) will be higher than our previous expectations.”</p>
      <p>Retail analyst Nick Bubb said: “Weak footfall may be a problem for many High Street retailers, but Greggs is having no problem in pulling in customers and today’s unscheduled update flags that the business is still on a roll.”</p>

      <p>Last month the bakery company reported that growth slowed to 12.4 per cent in the third quarter due to strong comparatives in the previous year. </p>
      <p>Like-for-like sales increased 7.4 per cent in the 13 weeks to 28 September, down from 10.5 per cent in the first half of the year.</p>
