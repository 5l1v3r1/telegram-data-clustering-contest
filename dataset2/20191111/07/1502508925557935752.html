      <h1>Responsibility of 'all of us' to give an alternative in Maharashtra: NCP</h1>
      <h2>Malik, NCP's spokesperson, said the party will not proceed with its decision till the Congress leadership takes a call on government formation in the state</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T07:20:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 07:20</time> by <a rel="author">Press Trust of India</a></address>
      <p>With the deadlock over government formation continuing in Maharashtra, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ncp">NCP </a>leader Nawab Malik on Monday said it is the responsibility of "all of us" to give an alternative considering the plight of people in the state.</p>
      <p>Malik, however, said the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ncp">NCP </a>will take any decision in consensus with its ally <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/congress">Congress.</a></p>
      <p>Amid talks that the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ncp">NCP </a>and <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/congress">Congress </a>may support the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/shiv-sena">Shiv Sena </a>in forming government, Malik told reporters here that there is a need to reach a consensus on "certain big issues" while working out a common minimum programme.</p>
      <p>"It is the responsibility of us all to give an alternative given the plight of the people and farmers. We are expecting a decision from the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/congress">Congress.</a> If there is a consensus, we will proceed towards government formation," the NCP's chief spokesperson said.</p>
      <p>Malik, however, said the NCP will not proceed with its decision till the Congress leadership takes a call on government formation in the state.</p>
      <p>The Congress' top leaders will hold parleys in Delhi at 4 pm on Monday.</p>
      <p>The BJP, which is the single largest party in the state with 105 seats, on Sunday decided against staking claim to form government for want of adequate numbers.</p>
      <p>The governor then invited the second largest party Shiv Sena, which has been at loggerheads with the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/bjp">BJP </a>over sharing the chief minister's post.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/shiv-sena">Shiv Sena </a>won 56 seats in the October 21 state polls, while the NCP and Congress bagged 54 and 44 seats, respectively.</p>
