      <h1>Elderly Norwegian’s death on Thai island of Lipe blamed on heart failure</h1>

      <p>Police have determined a 71-year-old Norwegian tourist found dead in his hotel room on a southern Thai island this past weekend died of natural causes.</p>
      <p>An initial examination found that Eng Soeng Ong most likely had a heart attack in his sleep. He was found dead Saturday night at the Bloom Cafe &amp; Hostel on Koh Lipe in Satun province.</p>
      <p>“We think he might have had sudden arrhythmic death syndrome,” said Lt. Col. Banjered Manavech, an investigator of marine police station 3.</p>
      <p>Police have ruled out foul play.</p>
      <p>“A preliminary post-mortem examination did not reveal any external or internal wound as well as evidence of a fight. Doctors believe his heart stopped beating suddenly,” reads a report forwarded by the police. </p>
      <p>Ong arrived on Koh Lipe and had checked into the hotel Nov. 4 for two weeks. His body has been transported to a hospital on the mainland for further examination.</p>
