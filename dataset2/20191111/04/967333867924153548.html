      <p>Residents of Canvey Island woke up Sunday morning to see swastikas spray-painted on two vehicles and a garage in some parts of the small island, located in Essex County in southeast England, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7670697/Swastikas-anti-Semitic-graffiti-Remembrance-Sunday-Canvey-Island-Essex.html">the Daily Mail reported.</a></p>
      <p>At least one car, a van, and a <a href="https://sputniknews.com/art_living/201911081077260238-antarctic-us-police-fail-to-catch-nazi-turtles-with-swastikas-on-their-shells/">garage door were reportedly vandalised</a> late-night on Saturday or early morning Sunday. The three properties were found daubed with Nazi signs and the words “Jews out” just a few hours before the two-minute silence, in which the royal family and politicians join thousands of veterans paying tribute to war dead at the Cenotaph in London.</p>

      <p>Local police at the scene of the criminal damage to cars in Ferrymead, Canvey Island, are reportedly <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201911101077268745-unesco-to-vote-on-removing-belgian-carnival-from-world-heritage-list-over-anti-semitism--report/">carrying out an investigation</a> to uncover the identity of the vandals.</p>
      <blockquote>“This community has welcomed people of all backgrounds, races and religions, and for someone to <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201911081077256728-labour-candidate-for-clacton-steps-down-amid-growing-antisemitism-allegations---reports/">publicly declare hatred</a> of certain members of society, and damage property in doing so, is unacceptable,” said police sergeant Victoria Jarvis, according to the Daily Mail.</blockquote>
