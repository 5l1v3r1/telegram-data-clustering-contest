      <p>A makeshift wooden box believed by a potentially crucial witness to have hidden the body of Stefan Sutherland was put together from fencing boards – according to the man who put up the barrier.</p>
      <p>Davy Crowden, 60, a forestry contractor from Wick, had erected the fence to provide some privacy for the residents at the house in Lybster, Caithness.</p>
      <p>When he visited a short time later, he was surprised to see several of the 13ft boards he had erected ­horizontally around the garden so recently had been removed and only the wire and metal fixings remained.</p>
      <p>In between visits, he had learned that Stefan had gone missing and that his body had washed up on the beach at nearby Occumster after 11 days.</p>
      <p>Davy had also heard Stefan was last seen going into the house where he had built the fence and was aware of rumours that the property, where drug dealing went on, was the scene of a murder.</p>

      <p>Davy said: “I obviously knew the people who lived there and didn’t want it to be true that Stefan had come to harm there. But when I saw part of the fence was gone and asked about it, no one could give me a good explanation.”</p>
      <p>Davy also said he was given a less-than-convincing explanation for damage caused to furniture he’d provided for the householders.</p>
      <p>He learned this August, through an interview in the <i><b>Record</b></i>, that Chris Boyd – who visited the home on the night Stefan vanished – said there had been a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/crime/murder-claim-witness-says-police-18959913">makeshift box in the living room</a>.</p>
      <p>It was after last drinks on Friday, September 6, 2013. Chris had gone there hoping to buy cannabis – on Stefan’s suggestion – and found two men sweating heavily having lifted the carpet and pushed the settee outside.</p>

      <p>Chris told the <i><b>Record</b> </i>that the men claimed they were doing “a bit of flooring”. He was told there was nothing for sale and to make himself scarce.</p>
      <p>It was only after he learned Stefan was dead and had been missing since that night that he realised the potential significance of what he had witnessed.</p>
      <p>Chris, 30, originally from Portsmouth but now living in Wick, said: “It was Friday night, so it seemed weird to be doing flooring.</p>
      <p>“Along one wall, there was a wooden box that looked like they had just made it from random bits of wood.</p>
      <p>“It wasn’t a piece of furniture, just an ugly makeshift box. I walked out not really giving it much thought. But when Stefan’s body came out of the sea, I remembered what the guy had done to Stefan before and his threat to kill him.</p>
      <p>“I thought about the carpet, the settee outside – but, most of all, about that box. I felt sure I’d seen Stefan’s coffin.</p>
      <p>“When I went to tell the cops, they weren’t having it. I thought what I was telling them was really important. But they insisted I was wrong. Stefan was a suicide, they said. I’d spoken to him that day and knew he was not suicidal.”</p>
      <p>Davy got in touch some weeks after reading the story because it had stirred his memory.</p>
      <p>Recounting his visit in the wake of Stefan’s death, he described noticing the damage to the couch as well as the fact some of his fencing had disappeared.</p>

      <p>Davy said: “The settee I had provided for the living room had a big patch on the surface that looked like it had been burned off. When I asked how it had happened, I was told nail polish had been spilled on it and had burned it.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t believe it, because what would it do to someone’s fingers if it could do that to leather or vinyl? But nobody offered me a better story.” Davy said that after some reflection, he became ­increasingly suspicious about what had occurred at the property.</p>
      <p>He said: “I’d wondered about that fence for a while but then they moved and I forgot about it.</p>
      <p>“I had worked out that the carpet and the settee could have been part of a clean-up to conceal a murder, though I didn’t want it to be the case. But I couldn’t think what had happened to the wooden boards from the fence.</p>
      <p>“Then I read the interview with Chris and I realised I knew what the box had been made of.”</p>
      <p>As well as contacting the <i><b>Record</b></i>, Davy has pledged to make a fresh ­statement to police.</p>
      <p>A team of six detectives has been sent to Caithness to review the evidence <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/stefan-sutherland-police-launch-cold-20382918">following pressure from Stefan’s family</a> and revelations in the <i><b>Record</b></i>.</p>
      <p>Once the review is complete, senior officers will decide whether to increase the strength of the investigation team to about 20 to try to establish whether Stefan was murdered, as his family and the community believe.</p>
      <p>Chris was asked whether he thought the box he saw might have been made from fencing boards.</p>

      <p>He said: “It’s a long time ago now and the detail is a bit hazy but I do think they were long strips of wood, each a few inches wide.</p>
      <p>“It would have been hard to make a box that held together without using long strips of sturdy wood, so I think it could have been made from the boards, especially if the wood from the fence disappeared around that time.”</p>
      <p>Stefan’s body washed up close to the family’s home at Occumster, September 17, 2013. Police quickly decided his death had been suicide or accidental, ignoring substantial evidence offered by Stefan’s injuries and by witnesses that pointed to murder.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/police-scotland">Police Scotland</a> has maintained until recently that Stefan’s death was not suspicious, despite evidence detailed by the <i><b>Record</b></i> this year.</p>
      <p>Stefan was last seen going into the home where drugs were sold and no independent witness saw him leaving.</p>
      <p>His body showed signs of a severe beating. The joints of his fingers had been pulled apart and his front teeth were smashed. The post-mortem showed he had not drowned, and his body was badly decomposed, indicating he had not gone into the sea alive or just after death.</p>
      <p>DNA tests on traces of blood in the drug-dealer’s living room proved it was Stefan’s, and witnesses, including Chris, revealed the carpet was lifted and later destroyed, yet police insisted there was no evidence of foul play.</p>
      <p>A succession of people who knew Stefan and gave statements to the police have told the <i><b>Record</b> </i>they <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/cops-bullied-witnesses-say-death-19122868">were bullied by cops who insisted his death was suicide</a> and forced to sign concocted statements.</p>
      <p>Eighteen of them later demanded the return of their statements so that they could be altered to reflect the truth but, to date, they remain unchanged.</p>

      <p>Stefan’s family now believe Police Scotland should take the same path it has on the suspicious death of Kevin Mcleod, from Wick, in February 1997 and order a ­comprehensive and ­independent review.</p>
      <p>Merseyside Police has recently begun to ­investigate Kevin’s death, which his family has always believed was murder.</p>
      <p>They only learned in 2017 that <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/northern-constabulary">Northern Constabulary</a> had never acted on an order from the procurator fiscal in 1997 to probe the case as a murder. Local officers always maintained it was an accident.</p>
      <p>Stefan’s dad Sandy said: “We’ve got a fresh team looking at Stefan’s case and we have more hope than we did before. But it is hard to trust Police ­Scotland after all we have been through.</p>
      <p>“There is ample evidence Stefan was murdered and we will have to judge the police on what they do, not what they say. The option to bring in an external force should remain open.”</p>
