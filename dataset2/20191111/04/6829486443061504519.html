      <p>Billie Eilish is encouraging fans to take a stand on climate change by offering free tickets for those who ‘take action’, in addition to committing to making her concerts more sustainable.</p>
      <p>Eilish, who was <a href="https://junkee.com/billie-eilish-review-melbourne/204204">in Australia this April and May</a>, has continually toured this year off the back of her massive debut album,<i> When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?</i>.</p>

      <p>While announcing even-more new dates, the 17-year-old pop-star committed to making her concerts greener (via <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/billie-eilish-fans-can-earn-tickets-to-her-tour-by-fighting-climate-change-2566259"><i>NME</i></a>). To do so, she’ll be teaming up with <a href="https://reverb.org/">Reverb</a>, an environmental non-for-profit who have previously worked with Shawn Mendes, <a href="https://junkee.com/fleetwood-mac-review/218290">Fleetwood Mac</a> and P!nk, among others.</p>
      <p>Part of this involves a ban on plastic straws and increased recycling options at venues, as well as an ‘eco-village’ set-up at concerts allowing fans to learn more about what they can do to help. There’s also an opportunity to win tickets via <a href="https://admin.globalcitizen.org/en/connect/billie/?subPage=/en/action/great-green-wall-quiz/">Global Citizen</a>, a website which offers redeemable points for each positive ‘action’ individuals do (largely signing petitions).</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Eilish attended a youth climate strike in LA with Greta Thunberg.<i> When We All Fall Asleep…</i> cut ‘all the good girls go to hell’ references our climate crisis, exploring anxiety stemming from California’s <a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-california-fires-record-report-20190309-story.html">unprecedented fires in 2018</a>, which all-in-all affected 750,000 acres of land, as well as claiming more than 17,000 homes and 100 lives.</p>
      <p>Eilish will release a new song called ‘everything i wanted’ next week, her first new music since a <a href="https://junkee.com/justin-bieber-billie-eilish-bad-guy/213470">pretty shoddy ‘bad guy’ remix</a> featuring Justin Bieber. Listen to ‘all the good girls go to hell’ below.</p>
