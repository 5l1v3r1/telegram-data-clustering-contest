      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T04:30:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Charlie Gall, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/charlie-gall/</a></address>
      <p>A teenage girl cheated death days before her birthday when a car careered into a bus stop, killing a man standing beside her.</p>
      <p>The horror impact flung Chloe Donaldson, 18, and the 70-year-old pensioner 15ft into the air, propelling them into a hotel car park.</p>
      <p>Investigators have remained at the tragedy scene – a stretch of dual-carriageway opposite a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/police">police</a> station.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/car-crashes">collision</a> occurred at 7.55pm on Saturday on Inverurie Road, near its junction with Gilbert Road, in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aberdeen">Aberdeen’s</a> Bucksburn area.</p>
      <p>It involved a black BMW estate car, a silver Nissan Pixo car and the two pedestrians at a bus stop at the Britannia Hotel.</p>
      <p>The pensioner, who has yet to be named, was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>

      <p>Chloe suffered serious injuries and was taken by ambulance to nearby Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, where she remains stable.</p>
      <p>But yesterday she took to a public forum on social media to thank well-wishers. She posted: “Thank you and yeah the guy at the bus stop died. I’m lucky I got away, thoughts are with his family.”</p>
      <p>Chloe, who turns 19 on Friday, told friends: “I was hit by the car at the bus stop along with another man.”</p>
      <p>She said one car came “round the corner and hit another car, hit the bus shelter and knocked both of us roughly 15ft into the Britannia car park”.</p>
      <p>There was a huge emergency response to the incident, which is not thought to be joy-riding related.</p>
      <p>Eyewitnesses described it as a major accident which involved four ambulances and a number police vehicles.</p>
      <p>One said the bus shelter was “all smashed to pieces” and a police officers with dogs had chased one suspect who fled the scene.</p>
      <p>Appealing for information Sergeant Craig McNeill said: “Our thoughts are with all those affected by this terrible tragedy.”</p>
