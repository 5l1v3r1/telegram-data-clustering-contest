      <p>PETALING JAYA, Nov 11 — Scandal-ridden actor Singaporean actor and singer Aliff Aziz has landed himself in hot water yet again.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old was arrested after getting allegedly involved in a drunken brawl near Orchard Towers, along Orchard Road in Singapore and a video of the incident has spread like wildfire on social media.</p>
      <p>In the minute-long clip, Aliff is heard shouting, “You talk to my father!” repeatedly as two police officers attempt to restrain and handcuff him.</p>
      <p>He then uses his free hand to call his dad on his mobile phone and loudly accuses the police of using brute force to subdue him.</p>

      <p>According to a representative from the Singapore Police Force, the arrest occurred at 6.40am on November 10 when patrolling officers found two men in a heated argument, <i>AsiaOne </i>reported.</p>
      <p>Aliff had reportedly “reeked of alcohol” and refused to comply with the officers’ repeated warnings to break up the fight.</p>
      <p>He was then arrested for violating Singapore’s Liquor Control Act by causing a public nuisance while intoxicated.</p>
      <p>However, he is believed to have been released last night as his mother has posted an Instagram video showing Aliff in high spirits while carrying his two-year-old son.</p>
      <p>“<i>Alhamdulillah</i>, thanks to everyone’s prayers, (Aliff) is okay, especially after seeing his son.</p>
      <p>“May we empathise towards fellow human beings as opposed to being the judge and jury,” she wrote on her profile which has since been set to private.</p>
      <p>2019 has been a year of lows for Aliff whose marriage to Bella Astillah ended in a bitter divorce in May following a string of extramarital affairs.</p>
      <p>He was also slapped with criminal charges in September for allegedly stealing RM1,200 from Indonesian celebrity Raja Yunika Perdhana Putri.</p>
