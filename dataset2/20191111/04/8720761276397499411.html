      <h1>Study of Over 11,000 Online Stores Finds 'Dark Patterns' on 1,254 sites</h1>

      <p>A large-scale academic study that analyzed more than 53,000 product pages on more than 11,000 online stores <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/user-interface-dark-patterns-are-becoming-common-on-online-stores/">found widespread use of user interface "dark patterns"</a> -- practices meant to mislead customers into making purchases based on false or misleading information. from a report:<i> The study -- presented last week at the ACM CSCW 2019 conference -- found 1,818 instances of dark patterns present on 1,254 of the ~11K shopping websites (~11.1%) researchers scanned. "Shopping websites that were more popular, according to Alexa rankings, were more likely to feature dark patterns," researchers said. But while the vast majority of UI dark patterns were meant to trick users into subscribing to newsletters or allowing broad data collection, some dark patterns were downright foul, trying to mislead users into making additional purchases, either by sneaking products into shopping carts or tricking users into believing products were about to sell out. Of these, the research team found 234 instances, deployed across 183 websites.</i></p>
