      <h1>Elisabeth Moss Has The Hallmark Movies App On Her Phone</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T04:17:21+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 04:17</time> by <a rel="author">Hunter Harris</a></address>
      <p>Some days you want to make a complicated, unnerving <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/04/her-smell-review-bracing-unnerving-depiction-of-addiction.html">movie about rock music and addition</a>, some days you just want to curl up and <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/81-christmas-movies-on-hallmark-lifetime-netflix-and-more.html">watch a love story</a> about a high-profile executive whose cold heart is softened when she’s sent to close down a local mall but ends up falling in love with the mall’s Santa. During Vulture Festival’s Anatomy of a Performance with Elisabeth Moss, the <i>Her Smell </i>star mentioned a not-so-guilty pleasure: she has the Hallmark movies app downloaded on her phone. “[I downloaded the app] for Christmas last year because I needed a way to watch Hallmark Christmas movies,” she said. “I needed a way to access all my Christmas movies because I love Hallmark Christmas movies and I watch as many of them as possible.” Moss is a romantic comedy stan, a Nancy Meyers-Nora Ephron devotee, and said her dream would be to be in a big Southampton home caught up in some pristine love triangle. “I’m into it, I want to do it. People who write should definitely write one for me,” she said. “I actually would love to do a Hallmark Christmas movie!”</p>
      <p>So what would an Elisabeth Moss Hallmark movie look like? “I’d be a shop-owner, and there’d be a Christmas tree farmer, you know, I’d hate him at first,” she said. But then, perhaps more realistically, given her penchant for the dramatic: “In my Hallmark movie I’d probably end up loosing the baby somewhere,” Moss laughed. “There’d be a <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/04/a-celebration-of-elisabeth-mosss-runny-mascara.html">lot of mascara</a>, and then I’d stab someone.” Okay by us!</p>
