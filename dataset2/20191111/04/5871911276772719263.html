      <p>The Bucks are all-in on making a title run this season, and with high hopes come major expectations.</p>
      <p>As such, when the team doesn’t play up to its full potential, players and coaches make sure to hold each other accountable.</p>
      <p>So when the team trailed 56-50 heading into halftime during Sunday’s game against the Thunder, the team’s best player took his anger out on an inanimate object. Giannis Antetokounmpo decided to kick a hole in this poor gate on his way to the locker room, and he absolutely destroyed it.</p>

      <p>It worked, as the Bucs scored 71 points in the second half and came back to win, 121-119.</p>
