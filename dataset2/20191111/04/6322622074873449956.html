      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 11): theedgmarkets.com highlighted eight stocks with momentum at Bursa Malaysia’s afternoon close today. Three stocks displayed positive momentum while five showed negative momentum.</p>
      <p>Stocks with positive momentum were:</p>
      <p>Karyon Industries Bhd – up 1.5 sen at 15.5 sen</p>
      <p>Lotus KFM Bhd – down 0.5 sen at 11 sen</p>
      <p>Xian Leng Holdings Bhd – up 3 sen at 67 sen</p>
      <p>Stocks with negative momentum were:</p>
      <p>Apollo Food Holdings Bhd – unchanged at RM4.03</p>
      <p>JF Technology Bhd – up 11 sen at RM1.30</p>
      <p>Pecca Group Bhd – up 1 sen at RM1.24</p>
      <p>Solid Automotive Bhd – up 2 sen at 30 sen</p>
      <p>VSTECS Bhd – up 12 sen at RM1.37</p>
      <p>The list of stocks with momentum is generated using a proprietary mathematical algorithm highlighting stocks with a build-up in trading volume and price. The algorithm differentiates between stocks that exhibit positive (+ve) momentum and negative (-ve) momentum.</p>
      <p>This list is not a buy or sell recommendation. It merely tells you which stocks are seeing higher than normal volume and price movements.</p>
      <p>The share price may move up or down from this point. But the “+ve” (suggesting a rising price trend on volume) and “-ve” (suggesting a falling price trend on volume) indicators should give readers a better idea of what the market is buying and when to sell. Note also that momentum generally persists for a short period of time.</p>
      <p>However, each stock has an accompanying fundamental score and valuation score to help readers evaluate the attractiveness of the stocks, if they want to ride the momentum.</p>
