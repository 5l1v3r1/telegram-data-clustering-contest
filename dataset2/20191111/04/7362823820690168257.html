      <h1>Steve Knight eyes old seat after Katie Hill resignation</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T04:56:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 04:56</time> by <a rel="author">Edmund DeMarche</a></address>
      <p>The two-term Republican who was ousted in 2018 by <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rep-katie-hill-resigns-amid-ethics-probe-into-reported-affair-with-staffer">Katie Hill </a>announced on his website Sunday that he will attempt to win back <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/katie-hill-floor-speech-trump">his old seat.</a></p>
      <p>“I am proud to return to public service and deliver the type of representation our district deserves,” Steve Knight posted on his website.</p>
      <p>Hill defeated Knight by 9 points in California’s 25th District in November. Hill-- a centrist-- was seen as a rising Democratic star because the district is seen as one of a few in the state that could be carried by a Republican.</p>
      <p>Henry Olsen, a columnist in the Washington Post, wrote a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/10/29/is-california-reopening-its-doors-gop/">piece</a> last month that questioned whether or not the state was “reopening” the doors to Republicans. He pointed out that the district was a Republican stronghold before President Trump. He also called the election—which will likely occur on March 3, a possible bellwether for Republicans.</p>
      <p>"Republicans have no chance of retaking the House if they cannot retake seats like the one Hill is vacating," Olsen wrote.</p>
      <p>Hill resigned from her seat last month after she said  explicit private photos of her with a campaign staffer had been “weaponized” by her husband and political operatives.</p>

      <p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Hill had acknowledged “errors in judgment” that Pelosi said made her continued service in Congress “untenable.”</p>
