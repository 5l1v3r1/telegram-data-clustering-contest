      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/paddy-mcguinness">Paddy McGuinness</a> has driven Phoenix Nights fans wild with speculation that the show could be making a comeback.</p>
      <p>The hit comedy about a working mens club hasn't been on telly screens since 2002, but Paddy's confirmed that everyone's on board to bring it back nearly twenty years down the line.</p>
      <p>The show, which also starred legendary comedian Peter Kay, only ran for two series but instantly became a cult classic among a hugely devoted fan base.</p>
      <p>Funnyman Paddy told <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/">The Daily Star</a>: "It was great. There's always talk about doing another one."</p>
      <p>The Take Me Out host added: "It's just time, it's just getting everyone together.</p>

      <p>The cast did make a brief return in 2015 for live shows to raise money for Comic Relief.</p>
      <p>"We did do it live," Paddy continued, "And that went really well. We sold out five nights playing to 15,000 people a night and that were great."</p>
      <p>There was also a 2004 spin-off, Max and Paddy, based on Peter and Paddy's characters.</p>

      <p>Peter previously revealed that while a third series has never materialised, the scripts have all been penned.</p>
      <p>For the time being, Paddy's back on presenting duties for hit dating show, Take Me Out.</p>
      <p>He's also landed the Top Gear presenting gig alongside cricketer Freddie Flintoff.</p>
      <p>Wife Christine recently revealed that Paddy's role on the motoring show has helped bring him closer to his autistic son, thanks to their shared passion for cars.</p>
      <p>"Top Gear has created a bond between my son and my husband," Christine said.</p>
      <p>She added: "Leo is passionate about cars. He loves things with wheels, anything that spins. He doesn't understand what a celebrity is or what a TV show is, but he knows that his daddy works with cars."</p>
