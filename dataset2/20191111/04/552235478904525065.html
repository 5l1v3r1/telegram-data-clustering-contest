      <h2>Jane Craigie looked like she was facing life in a wheelchair suffering acute pain but thankfully a 'miracle' mirror therapy has helped provide relief.</h2>

      <p>A woman has told how a 16st drunk falling on her at a party left her is so much pain that even a puff of wind caused her agony.</p>
      <p>But a little-known therapy for an even more rarely diagnosed condition has finally given Jane Craigie hope of a normal life again.</p>
      <p>The 47-year-old said: “I was suicidal for many years.</p>
      <p>“The slightest touch left me screaming in pain. The smallest movement was excruciating.”</p>
      <p>Without graded motor imagery (GMT), a therapy which gets patients to view mirror imagery to stimulate a healthy pain-free response in the brain, Jane from Orkney, says her future would have been very bleak.</p>
      <p>She said: “In fact, without it, I don’t think I would still be here.”</p>
      <p>The former veterinary nurse was injured when the drunk fell on her as she kneeled to sign a birthday card. It was thought she had escaped with just a sprained ankle but she woke the following morning in horrendous pain.</p>
      <p>Jane said: “At first doctors were looking for a break but I had only sprained my ankle.</p>
      <p>“It was when I was still in agony four months later that I was sent to hospital in Aberdeen where I was finally diagnosed with chronic regional pain syndrome.”</p>
      <p>CRPS is a chronic condition which causes massive disruption to the nervous system so the merest pressure can be perceived as pain. In Jane’s case the slightest movement, even standing up, was unbearable.</p>

      <p>Jane was supported by her family, including husband Bruce who she met only three months before the accident in November 2003.</p>
      <p>After years of physio and physical therapy to try to treat her condition and desensitise herself, she discovered GMT through physio and principal instructor for the Neuro Orthopaedic Institute in the UK, Tim Beames, and his company Pain and Performance.</p>
      <p>The rehabilitation process includes motor imagery exercises and mirror therapy to help re-train the brain. By imagining movement, the brain is activated in a similar way to actually doing it.</p>
      <p>It’s a way of stimulating the healthy activity in the brain which has been lost or is being lost when someone has CRPS.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Slowly, the treatment enabled Jane to sit upright, and eventually to be able to stand.</p>
      <p>She said: “Without GMI and Tim I wouldn’t have even managed to get into a wheelchair, let alone stand.</p>
      <p>“CRPS affected every aspect of my life. Even going to the supermarket in a wheelchair was almost impossible because my nervous system perceived the noise, lights and busyness as pain.”</p>
      <p>She added: “It’s been a hard road but I’m strong. You have choices: you can either sit back and do nothing or you can get up and fight and that’s what I did. Now I can focus not on my pain but living my life again.”</p>
