      <h1>Man Utd boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer issues Scott McTominay injury update</h1>
      <h2>Solskjaer fears McTominay could be out with 'painful' ankle injury for as much as two months</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T04:44:20+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 04:44</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has outlined his fears that Scott McTominay could be out for two months after suffering an ankle injury.</p>
      <p>McTominay was passed fit to play in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/man-utd-3-1-brighton-20853932">United's 3-1 win</a> over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> on Sunday after suffering a knock to his foot in Thursday's Europa League victory over Partizan Belgrade.</p>
      <p>But injury struck again as the midfielder went over on his ankle close to the end of the win over Brighton at Old Trafford which catapulted <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">United</a> up to seventh in the Premier League.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/scott-mctominay">McTominay</a> is due to have a scan on Monday to determine the severity of the injury - with United boss Solskjaer hoping that one of his star performers will only be sidelined for a couple of weeks at most.</p>
      <p>However, Solskjaer recalled one injury he suffered in his playing days which kept him out for eight weeks.</p>

      <p>"He went over on his ankle. It's a painful one," said the former United striker.</p>
      <p>"I've had one and I was out for eight weeks. But then again sometimes you're back in two weeks, so I don't know.</p>
      <p>"He's in for a scan tomorrow, but it looked painful and he's not one for rolling around."</p>
      <p>With the international break coming up United are not in action for two weeks, with their next game the visit to Sheffield United in the Premier League on November 24.</p>

      <p>But McTominay looks set to miss Scotland's Euro 2020 qualifying double-header against Cyprus and Kazakhstan.</p>
      <p>Having been helped off the pitch after treatment, he was taken down the tunnel on a stretcher after several minutes of attention in the technical area.</p>
      <p>McTominay was able to walk out of Old Trafford, albeit with a bit of a limp.</p>
      <p>On Monday he is due to meet up with his Scotland team-mates ahead of their final European Championship qualifiers against Cyprus away to Cyprus next Saturday and at home to Kazakhstan a week on Tuesday.</p>
