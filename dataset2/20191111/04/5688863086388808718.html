        <b>Shreyas Iyer, whose blistering 33-ball 62, helped India recover from an early slump in the third T20I in Nagpur, has revealed that he's been backing his instincts in the last couple of seasons. Iyer also shed light on the difficulty of the Nagpur track and stressed on the importance of self belief.</b>

      <p>After being reduced for 35-2 inside the first powerplay, India looked in deep trouble and for an extended period of time, it looked highly likely that we might get a repeat of the first T20I in Delhi. And just like the Delhi T20, young <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/shreyas_iyer">Shreyas </a><a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/iyer">Iyer</a> started off on a confident note. However, much in contrast to the first T20I, Iyer ensured that he made his time at the middle count as he went on to post a masterful 62 which eventually ended up being a match-winning knock.</p>
      <p>Iyer, in the post-match presentation, revealed that he has been backing his instincts over the last couple of seasons and expressed his happiness over the same. He also acknowledged the importance of his 59-run stand with <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/kl_rahul">KL Rahul</a> and stressed on the importance of self-belief in high-pressure situations.</p>
      <p>"I have done it (the big hitting) in the past and you need to back yourself in those situations. We needed a partnership at that time; I saw that their part-timer had come on and decided to go after him. I have been backing my instincts in the last couple of seasons. I am really happy with the consistency so far," Iyer was quoted as saying by Cricbuzz.</p>
      <p>Throughout the course of the match, batsmen from both teams found it extremely difficult to start their innings well and Iyer shed light on the difficulty of the wicket and revealed that it was important for him to take his time and play himself in.</p>
      <p>Being someone who always relishes challenges, Iyer also expressed his delight over India pulling through despite being on the back-foot for a long while and branded the experience as 'once in a lifetime'.</p>
      <p>"To be honest it wasn't an even innings. It was dicey at the start. It was really tough for me to analyse the wicket. Once I got in I thought I would give myself some time, it really worked out for me today," Iyer said.</p>
      <p>"It was really important for us to be in this tough situation as we have not been in such a situation before. I am really happy with the support we have got. This is a once in a lifetime experience and hopefully we carry forward the momentum," he signed off.</p>
