      <h1>Key backer of Syria's White Helmets dies in Turkey</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T14:49:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 14:49</time> by <a rel="author">Yuliya Talmazan and ReutersÂ </a></address>
      <p>A key backer of the group that trained <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/syria-s-white-helmets-trapped-between-warring-forces-global-factions-n893876">Syria's White Helmets</a> emergency response group has died in Turkey, the organization confirmed Monday.</p>
      <p>White Helmets tweeted that they have learned "with shock and sadness" about the death of James Le Mesurier at his home in Istanbul.</p>
      <p>"The Syria Civil Defense family extends its deepest condolences to the James family, and we express our deepest sorrow and solidarity with his family," the group <a href="https://twitter.com/SyriaCivilDef/status/1193870352360886277">said in a tweet</a>. "As we also must commend his humanitarian efforts which Syrians will always remember."</p>
      <p>The organization, whose network of volunteer rescue workers helps communities in war-ravaged Syria prepare for and recover from attacks, did not reveal how Le Mesurier died.</p>
      <p>NBC News has reached out to Mayday Rescue for further comment on Le Mesurier's death. Turkish police were not immediately available for comment.</p>
      <p>The White Helmets, known officially as Syria Civil Defence, have been widely hailed for saving more than 115,000 lives in rebel-held areas during years of bombing by Syrian government and Russian forces.</p>
      <p>White Helmets members say they are neutral, but Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his backers describe them as tools of Western propaganda and Islamist-led insurgents.</p>
      <p>Le Mesurier founded Mayday Rescue, a Netherlands-based non-profit that helps establish community-based rescue and recovery teams, and is one of the institutions supporting the White Helmets.</p>
      <p>In 2016, Le Mesurier was <a href="https://www.thegazette.co.uk/notice/2553067?mainwebsite=1">awarded a knighthood</a> by Queen Elizabeth II for the protection of civilians in Syria.</p>
