      <h2>The hit sitcom The Big Bang Theory may be over but fans will never stop loving Jim Parsons as Sheldon Cooper - but now we know why he was cast in the first place</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T14:26:47+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 14:26</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Knight, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/lewis-knight/</a></address>
      <p>The creators of one of the most popular US sitcoms of all time have revealed why they cast one of its stars.</p>
      <p>In one of the all-new clips in the complete boxset of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/the-big-bang-theory">The Big Bang Theory</a> , Sheldon Cooper actor <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jim-parsons">Jim Parsons</a> interviews the creators of the series and they discuss why Parsons was cast as his quirky genius character in the first place.</p>
      <p>The new clip, revealed via <a href="https://www.tvinsider.com/830468/the-big-bang-theory-complete-series-bluray-dvd-jim-parsons-sheldon/">TV Insider</a> , shows us why Parsons was so perfect for the role.</p>
      <p>Co-creator Chuck Lorre said: "It was astonishing. I didn't even believe it when it happened. I never anticipated the character being the way he crafted it."</p>
      <p>"It was funny, it was touching, it was real… so when that happens you say thank you God, book em’ and move on."</p>
      <p>Co-creator Bill Prady agreed, adding: "I said, filled with inexperience and enthusiasm, I said to Chuck 'that's the guy, that’s the guy!'</p>
      <p>"and Chuck said ‘he’s gonna break your heart he’s never gonna give you that performance again.'"</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Jim Parsons revealed his own reason for wanting the part, saying: "I really liked how they packed all this stuff into these little paragraphs that needed to be worked on and figured out.</p>
      <p>"It played like a song, to my ear."</p>
      <p>And history was made!</p>
      <p>The clip is part of the all new complete box set that Warner Bros is bringing out just in time for Christmas.</p>
