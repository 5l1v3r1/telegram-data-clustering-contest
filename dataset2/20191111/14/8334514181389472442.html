      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - The leader of Britain’s opposition Labour Party said on Monday that U.S. President Donald Trump had got his wish for Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage to make a pact with Prime Minister Boris Johnson.</p>
      <p>Farage said he would not stand candidates against Johnson’s Conservatives in 317 seats the party won in 2017.</p>
      <p>“One week ago Donald Trump told Nigel Farage to make a pact with Boris Johnson,” Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said on Twitter. “Today, Trump got his wish.”</p>
      <p>“This Trump alliance is Thatcherism on steroids and could send 500 million pounds a week from our NHS to big drugs companies. It must be stopped.”</p>
