      <p>Cape Town - Could the Mother of Dragons be the next 007?</p>
      <p>Emilia Clarke recently admitted that joining the 007 franchise – especially with Daniel Craig set to retire soon – would be the "coolest thing ever", <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/10/game-thrones-emilia-clarke-wants-play-first-female-james-bond-hell-yeah-11073270/"><b>Metro</b></a> reported.</p>
      <p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/empire-issue-preview-2020-preview-little-women-fight-club-last-christmas-marriage-story/"><b>Empire</b></a> the 33-year-old Game Of Thrones star revealed she’d love to be the first female to portray the role of James Bond.</p>
      <p>Asked if she was keen on taking up the role, she responded excitedly: "Yeah! Of course!"</p>
      <p>"Hell to the yeah! James Bond is one of those franchises where it's never not cool."</p>
      <p>She added, "You could literally make the naffest James Bond in the world and it would still be cool."</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/game-thrones-emilia-clarke-wants-20857287"><b>Mirror</b></a>, black British actress Lashana Lynch is rumoured to take over as Bond in the next 007 instalment <i>No Time To Die</i>.</p>
      <p>While Lashana’s role hasn’t been confirmed yet, this is even more reason why Emilia should keep an eye out for the role.</p>
