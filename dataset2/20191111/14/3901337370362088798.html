      <p>Speaking in his weekly column for <i>Betfair</i>, Barca legend Rivaldo recently gave his thoughts on the speculation surrounding Valverde's future at the club.</p>
      <p>"With Barcelona on a bad run, rumours start immediately about potential replacements for manager Ernesto Valverde," Rivaldo wrote.</p>
      <p>"One name that's been mentioned is Ronald Koeman, and the Dutchman could be, for sure, an excellent option for the club.</p>
      <p>"But any decision on Valverde's future will be based on how Barcelona perform in the Champions League, as in La Liga they should at least fight for the title.</p>

      <p>"If Valverde fails to win the competition once again, then we'll probably see a new manager in Barcelona next season.</p>
      <p>"The club wants to lift the European trophy with Valverde, but he isn't managing to do it, so I believe this would be his last chance, even if he is a great manager.</p>
      <p>"To be crowned Spanish champion isn't new for Barca fans and won't make them happy enough because their true obsession now is the Champions League.</p>
      <p>"If Valverde fails again, I think it would be the right time to change.‚Äù</p>
