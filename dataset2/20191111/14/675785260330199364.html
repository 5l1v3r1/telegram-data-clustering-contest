      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T14:38:44+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 14:38</time> by <a rel="author">Sara-Aisha Kent, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/sara-aisha-kent/</a></address>
      <p>Geordie Shore catapulted Gaz (Gary) Beadle to to fame because of his wild partying and never-ending bed-hopping.</p>
      <p>Since leaving the series in 2016 the 31-year-old swapped necking shots for the chilling on sofa and ditched nights on the Toon for dates with his sweetheart Emma McVey.</p>
      <p>The reformed Lothario may have settled down, become a father and proposed to brunette beauty Emma, 27, but his chequered love life has been documented on reality TV over the years.</p>
      <p>Here is a look at Gaz's little black book of hook-ups prior to him ending his love rat ways.</p>

      <p>Jemma Lucy was the woman who Gaz had a romp with during his appearance on Ex on the Beach that led to him and Charlotte calling time on their relationship.</p>
      <p>The Newcastle native, who had sex with Jemma on the first night, went on to say he regretted sleeping with the bombshell and suggested that she took advantage of his drunken state for her own personal gain.</p>
      <p>"I kind of regret the first night," he said. "I just think I walked straight into a trap, really. Obviously I was p***ed but I can't blame that. But certain people set out to do certain things."</p>
      <p>Jemma insisted that their tryst was a mutual decision and even shut down Gaz's claims that he made the mistake because he was drunk, hinting there was plenty of sober sex in the morning too.</p>
      <p>"At the time it certainly didn't feel like Gaz regretted sleeping with me and very much felt mutual," Jemma told Mirror Online.</p>
      <p>"Personally I had a great time, and again in the morning it was a great experience."</p>
      <h3>Marnie Simpson</h3>

      <p>Charlotte Crosby was not the only Geordie Shore cast member that Gaz got up close and personal with.</p>
      <p>He ended up in bed with Marnie Simpson in season 8 of the series.</p>
      <p>However, the after their short-lived fling Marnie was open about her regret.</p>
      <p>The stunner told the MailOnline: "If I'm honest, I feel physically sick with what happened with Gary.</p>
      <p>"If I could go back in time that would be the one thing I would change. It makes me sick up when I think about it."</p>
      <h3>Charlotte Dawson</h3>

      <p>One of Gaz's longer courtships was with blonde Lillie Lexie Gregg.</p>
      <p>The couple were an item for 18 months before ending their relationship, which Lillie revealed was down to Gaz being unable to choose between her and Geordie Shore.</p>
      <p>The pretty star told Mirror Online: "He was told he would have to leave the show that day if he picked me. It was a daunting decision for him because that's his bread and butter. The show is all he's ever known.</p>
      <p>"It was the hardest decision of his life but ultimately he picked Geordie Shore."</p>
      <p>After they split, Lillie Lexie broke off all contact with Gaz, leading him to think that she never really cared - the pair then had an emotional reunion on Ex on The Beach where the former flames got closure.</p>

      <p>The Essex babe met the charmer in Ibiza but their romance fizzled out as fast as it started.</p>
      <p>Gaz told OK! Magazine at the time: "I necked on with her quite a few times.</p>
      <p>"She's actually a wicked girl. She's a good laugh, we had a good time. We had good banter and were cracking on.‚Äù</p>
