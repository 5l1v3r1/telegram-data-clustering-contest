      <p>Mercedes-Benzs are also a popular choice among ballers today, with Liverpool's Salah and South Africa striker Dino Ndlovu being two of them.  </p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Ndlovu added a R3 million Mercedes G63 to his luxurious car collection, while the Egyptian superstar can be seen entering the Liverpool training ground parking lot in a Mercedes AMG GLE Coupe.</p>
