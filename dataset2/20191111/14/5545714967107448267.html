      <p>We are just a little over a week out from the release of <i>BlazBlue: Cross Tag Battle</i>'s Version 2.0 update, which brings a posse of new characters to to the crossover fighter. Arc System Works has released two new trailers looking at <i>BlazBlue: Central Fiction</i>'s Celica A. Mercury and Susanoo, both of whom are getting set to join the rumble.<br/><br/>Celica A. Mercury, who made her playable debut in<i> BlazBlue: Chrono Phantasma Extend</i>, is the younger sister of Nine the Phantom, and was a kindhearted young nun who was murdered by <i>BlazBlue</i> villain Yuuki Terumi. Now regenerated as her younger self, Celica continues to espouse her will for good, taking the fight to the enemy alongside her "Drive," Minerva.</p>

      <p>Susanoo is the ultimate form of the aforementioned Yuuki Terumi, who fused with Susanoo Unit to become the preliminary<i> BlazBlue</i> antagonist. Susanoo's form combines cyber-mechanics with the visual style of Japanese warriors such as the ninja and the samurai. As is to be expected with "Big Bads," Susanoo is a destructive force in the thick of the fight.<br/><br/><br/>Celica A. Mercury and Susanoo join <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../blazblue-cross-tag-battle-reveals-dlc-characters-celica-a-mercury-susanoo-elizabeth-tohru-adachi-and-hilda-567670.phtml">seven other fighters</a> as part of the $25 Version 2.0 character pack, which will be available to purchase on all platforms November 21. All players will receive a free update that day, which will include a UI overhaul, a huge list of balance tweaks, new scenarios, and a run of bug fixes.<br/><br/><i>BlazBlue: Cross Tag Battle</i> is available now on PS4, PC and Nintendo Switch.<br/><br/><a href="https://gematsu.com/2019/11/blazblue-cross-tag-battle-dlc-characters-celica-a-mercury-elizabeth-and-susanoo-trailers">BlazBlue: Cross Tag Battle DLC characters</a> [Gematsu]</p>
