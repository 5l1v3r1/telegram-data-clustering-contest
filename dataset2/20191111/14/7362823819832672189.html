      <p>The Tarzan’s Treehouse attraction at <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/general/disney">Disneyland</a> was reopened Monday morning after it was forced to close on Sunday when a guest damaged a wooden slat while reportedly demonstrating to his children how strong the suspended bridge was.</p>

      <p>According to reports, a guest was crossing the rope-suspended bridge at the Anaheim <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/general/family-travel">park</a> when he began to jump up and down on it to show his children the bridge would not break, <a href="https://www.micechat.com/242072-breaking-news-tarzans-treehouse-emergency-closes-at-disneyland/">MiceChat</a> reports. During this, the guest allegedly broke one of the wooden slats on the bridge, which is suspended roughly three stories above ground.</p>
