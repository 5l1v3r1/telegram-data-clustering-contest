      <h1>Aviation experts explain why plane window blinds have to be up during landing</h1>
      <h2>Passengers are often asked to raise their plane window blinds by flight attendants just before landing takes place and it's actually to do with their safety</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T14:10:22+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 14:10</time> by <a rel="author">Julie Delahaye, https://www.facebook.com/juliedjourno</a></address>
      <p>When you're on a flight, there are plenty of rules to follow such as no smoking, staying seated when the seatbelt signs are on etc.</p>
      <p>But one rule that often puzzles passengers comes during take-off and landing, when flight attendants ensure that all plane window blinds are raised.</p>
      <p>In fact, they will walk along the cabin and ask passengers to open any closed blinds - even if that means waking up a sleeping passenger.</p>
      <p>However, they're not doing it just so that passengers can take in pretty views.</p>
      <p>In fact, aviation experts have revealed on <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-do-crew-members-request-to-keep-window-shades-open-in-airplanes-during-takeoff-and-landing">Quora</a> that this plays a key role in passenger safety.</p>
      <p>Overall, it seems to come down to two key reasons.</p>
      <p>The first is to adjust passengers' eyes to the light outside, according to pilot Amitesh as well as some aviation enthusiasts.</p>
      <p>For example, if you're starting with a day flight that lands at night, or vice versa, it gives you time to acclimatise to the light and also ensures you have good vision should there be an emergency.</p>

      <p>Airlines tend to aim to complete evacuations in 90 seconds, so having passengers who can easily see where they are going can be a major help - it's also why the cabin lights are dimmed before plane landings at night time.</p>
      <p>The second reason?</p>
      <p>Former pilot John Keese explains on the thread that it's useful in an emergency for people - whether that be cabin crew or passengers - to see what is going on outside the cabin.</p>
      <p>With all of the window blinds up, in the event of an emergency it means that cabin crew can have a clearer picture of what is going on and assess the situation.</p>
      <p>For example, in the rare case of an evacuation, they can check that the surroundings are safe before people disembark from the plane.</p>
      <p>The extra benefit is that, with the plane windows raised, passengers can see out of the windows easily and can spot any potential issues.</p>
      <p>With pilots in the cockpit and the flight attendants often sat on either end of the plane during landing, the passengers become invaluable pairs of eyes and can flag any problems they can see from their seat.</p>
      <p>In extreme situations, it also allows emergency services to be able to see inside the plane.</p>
