      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 11): Westports Holdings Bhd announced today that its wholly-owned Westports Malaysia Sdn Bhd (WMSB) has closed two berths to assess damages as a safety measure, following the collision of a berthing container vessel with two ship-to-shore cranes.</p>
      <p>The group said the incident happened on Nov 8.</p>
      <p>"The company is ascertaining the contributing factors that gave rise to the incident. Both the container vessel concerned and WMSB’s affected assets have insurance coverages. Westports would make an announcement when there are notable developments on this incident," the group said in a bourse filing today.</p>
      <p>WMSB, it went on to say, has 20 container berths and 67 ship-to-shore cranes.</p>
      <p>“The temporary berths closure is not expected to have a material impact on the overall container operations, as terminal handling of containers at all other berths continue as usual. The incident is also not expected to have any material effect on the earnings of Westports,” the group added.</p>
      <p>Westports' shares fell four sen or 0.94% to close at RM4.21 today, giving it a market capitalisation of RM14.36 billion. From a year ago, the stock has climbed 15.44%.</p>
