      <p>HONG KONG: Police in Hong Kong fired tear gas in the city's central business district as violence flared on Monday (Nov 11) following <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/hong-kong-police-shoot-protester-sai-wan-ho-12081540">a shooting</a> earlier in the day.</p>
      <p>During the lunchtime break in Central, a downtown district that hosts blue-chip international conglomerates and luxury retailers, police fired tear gas to disperse thousands of protesters, many dressed in office attire, chanting "murderers" and "triads".</p>

      <p>Many expressed anger over the shooting that morning.</p>
      <p>"He was not carrying any weapon, what threat could he pose on the officer," a 29-year-old office worker, who gave her first name Elaine, told AFP as fellow office workers coughed and wretched from the acrid clouds.</p>
      <p>Tear gas was also fired at Hong Kong Polytechnic University with witnesses reporting tense standoffs between students, protesters and police. All classes were cancelled.</p>
      <p>Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets, while protesters hurled homemade petrol bombs at police.  Students set fire to debris at the Polytechnic University on the Kowloon side of Victoria Harbour.</p>
      <p>"I am worried about my safety but I will still come out," said Anson, a 20-year-old student at the university who only gave his first name. </p>
      <p>"I am willing to sacrifice my life for Hong Kong."</p>
      <p>One video circulated by protesters on messaging channels from Kwai Fong district showed a police officer trying to drive his motorbike multiple times into protesters who had gathered on a road.</p>
