      <h1>Tulsi Gabbard is demanding an apology from Hillary Clinton</h1>

      <p>Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) is keeping up her feud with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.</p>
      <p>Gabbard's 2020 campaign released a letter from its legal counsel Monday demanding Clinton apologize and retract comments she made about her in October, <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/469843-gabbard-lawyers-demand-retraction-of-clintons-defamation"><i>The Hill </i>reports</a>. Clinton <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/872747/hillary-clinton-claims-jill-stein-russian-asset-suggests-republicans-are-grooming-tulsi-gabbard">in a podcast</a> on Oct. 17 called Gabbard the "favorite of the Russians," also saying she's being groomed for a third-party bid. The latter remark was initially reported widely as referring to Russians grooming Gabbard, though Clinton's spokesperson later said she meant Gabbard is being groomed by Republicans. Clinton additionally referred to Jill Stein as "also a Russian asset" after talking about Gabbard, with the "also" seeming to suggest Clinton thinks Gabbard is one as well.</p>
      <p>Gabbard's legal counsel rejected Clinton's explanation for the "grooming" comment, <a href="https://twitter.com/DanielStrauss4/status/1193878643849793537">in the Monday letter</a> calling the idea that she meant Republicans "spin developed only after you realized the defamatory nature of your statement, and therefore your legal liability." Clinton's comments are "actionable as defamation," the letter also says, going on to demand she "immediately hold a press conference to verbally retract — in full — your comments." Beyond that, Gabbard's counsel demands Clinton release a retraction on her Twitter account and distribute it to major news outlets, with an exact wording even being provided; a statement has Clinton saying she made a "grave mistake," that she apologizes, and that "I support and admire" Gabbard's work.</p>
      <p>This is Gabbard's latest escalation of her war against Clinton after <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/873004/tulsi-gabbard-deems-hillary-clinton-queen-warmongers-outrageous-tweet-storm">tearing into her</a> immediately after the October comments in a stunning Twitter thread, calling her "the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long."</p>
