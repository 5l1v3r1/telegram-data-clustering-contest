        <b>The government has launched the first taka bond worth around millions of dollars on London Stock Exchange or LSE.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Finance Minister AHM Mustafa Kamal, Prime Minister’s Adviser on Private Sector Industry and Investment Salman F Rahman and Bangladesh High Commissioner to the UK Saida Muna Tasneem attended the enlistment ceremony in London on Monday.</p>
      <p>Backed by the World Bank Group’s private sector lending arm International Finance Corporation, the taka-denominated bond is part of a plan to raise funds to invest in private infrastructure projects and public-private partnerships or PPPs in Bangladesh.</p>
      <p>Initially, about $10 million will be drawn through bond sales, said Shehzeen Choudhury, the IFC’s communications officer for South Asia.</p>
      <p>The government may increase the size of the bond to $1 billion depending on initial interest. The proceeds of the taka bond will be lent to clients in Bangladesh.</p>
