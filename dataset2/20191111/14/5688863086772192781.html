        <b>The Sri Lanka government has introduced strong legislation to curb corruption in the cricketing setup of the country after numerous allegations against the board. Sports Minister Harin Fernando expressed his joy over the passing of the legislation which restricts betting on overseas fixtures.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sri Lanka Cricket has been peppered with allegations of corruption for years now, including claims of match-fixing ahead of an international Test against England last year. On Monday ( November 11), the Sri Lanka government passed a legislation which introduced strong restrictions on sports betting in the country as well as tough penalties for match-fixing.</p>
      <p>The legislation now criminalises betting on overseas matches, adding to the previous restrictions which barred citizens from betting on domestic matches. Sports Minister Harin Fernando expressed his joy after the law was passed unanimously by parliament.</p>
      <p>"Many tried to prevent this piece of legislation, but I am happy that it was taken up today," Times Now news quoted Fernando.</p>
      <p>The sports minister had previously highlighted that the local governance of the sport is riddled with graft "from top to bottom" while the International Council for Cricket (<a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/tournament/icc">ICC</a>) has hailed the island nation as one of the world's most corrupt cricketing nations.</p>
      <p>Former Sri Lankan fast bowler Dilhara Lokuhettige was last year suspended for corruption linked to a limited-over league in 2017.</p>
      <p>He was the third Sri Lankan player charged for violating the ICC's anti-corruption code, following charges levelled against the former captain and ex-chief selector Sanath Jayasuriya, and former paceman Nuwan Zoysa.</p>
