      <p>SINGAPORE: A man climbed onto a parapet to watch a woman showering and later used his phone to film the victim for "a better view".</p>
      <p>For insulting the modesty of this 23-year-old woman, along with two others, 27-year-old Mohamed Noor Hakim Mohamed Jamal was sentenced to nine weeks' jail on Monday (Nov 11).</p>

      <p>The court heard that Hakim was a despatch rider at the time of the offences. </p>
      <p>He had targeted three victims, aged 23, 22 and 18, once every year since 2017.</p>
      <p>The first incident occurred on the night of Aug 29, 2017, when Hakim was playing with his nieces at a playground in a housing estate. </p>
      <p>All locations were redacted from court documents to protect the victims' identities.</p>
      <p>He noticed that the lights were switched on in a toilet at a flat and had an urge to peep inside, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Benedict Chan.</p>
      <p>He climbed onto the ledge of the parapet located outside of the toilet and peeped in, but could see only the head and shoulders of a woman inside.</p>
      <p>Court documents did not state which floor this occurred at.</p>
      <p>In order to get a better view of the victim, Hakim took a video recording of the woman with his phone, before returning to his nieces at the playground.</p>
      <p>After watching it, he deleted the video as he feared being caught with it.</p>
      <p>However, a neighbour saw Hakim walking up and down the corridor and taking a picture of video of the toilet, and reported the incident to the police.</p>
      <p>Hakim went on to offend a second time more than a year later on Nov 6, 2018.</p>

        <b>TARGETS SECOND VICTIM A YEAR LATER</b>
      </p>
      <p>He stood along the corridor outside a flat and watched a 22-year-old woman taking off her clothes.</p>
      <p>The woman told her brother-in-law what happened, and he tried to catch Hakim but did not manage to, as he had left.</p>
      <p>The family aimed their closed-circuit television camera towards the location where Hakim and been, and successfully caught him trying to peek into the unit again four days later.</p>
      <p>He was arrested and admitted to peeping into the victim's ninth-floor unit several times.</p>
      <p>The third incident occurred on Aug 7 this year, while Hakim was on his way to visit his sister.</p>
      <p>He cycled past a flat that he was familiar with, as he had seen a girl inside when he broke into the house in 2017.</p>
      <p>He parked his bicycle a few blocks away and went to the unit, carefully avoiding police cameras along the way, said the prosecutor.</p>
      <p>He heard someone showering in the toilet and stood on the parapet in front of the toilet window to film her.</p>
      <p>He extended his phone through the ajar toilet window to record the 18-year-old girl showering.</p>
      <p>The girl saw his hand and the phone and screamed, prompting Hakim to flee.</p>
      <p>He admitted to committing the offences to "satisfy his sexual urges".</p>
      <p>The prosecution asked for 11 weeks' jail, saying that Hakim's multiple offences over three years "demonstrated his persistent voyeuristic ways".</p>
      <p>"The accused has no psychiatric illness or disorder, and his urges were not uncontrollable," he said.</p>
      <p>Hakim had tried to destroy evidence by deleting video footage of two victims, and had intentionally avoided police cameras to evade detection.</p>
      <p>For each count of intruding on the privacy of a woman to insult her modesty, Hakim could have been jailed for up to a year, fined, or both.</p>
