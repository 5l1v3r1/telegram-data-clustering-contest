      <p>Suicide is the <a href="https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/help-yourself/youth/">second leading cause of death for young people</a> between ages 10 and 24. That's much higher than the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/suicide.htm">general population where it's the 10th leading cause of death</a> according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It's important to recognize <a href="https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/how-we-can-all-prevent-suicide/">the potential warning signs when someone intends to end their life</a> as laid out here from the Suicide Prevention Lifeline:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Talking about wanting to die or to kill themselves</li>
        <li>Looking for a way to kill themselves, like searching online or buying a gun</li>
        <li>Talking about feeling hopeless or having no reason to live</li>
        <li>Talking about feeling trapped or in unbearable pain</li>
        <li>Talking about being a burden to others</li>
        <li>Increasing the use of alcohol or drugs</li>
        <li>Acting agitated; behaving recklessly</li>
        <li>Sleeping too little or too much</li>
        <li>Withdrawing or isolating themselves</li>
        <li>Showing rage or talking about seeking revenge</li>
        <li>Extreme mood swings</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Suicide rates in the U.S. have <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/07/health/suicide-report-cdc/index.html">increased more than 25%</a> since 1999. They're also rising worldwide with some <a href="http://www.who.int/mental_health/prevention/suicide/suicideprevent/en/">one million people dying annually from suicide</a> . The World Health Organization estimates a global suicide rate of one death every 40 seconds. By 2020 they predict someone will take their life every 20 seconds.</p>
