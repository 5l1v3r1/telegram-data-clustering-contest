      <p>Roche said on Monday its drug risdiplam helped people with type 2 or 3 spinal muscular atrophy improve their motor function, as the Swiss drugmaker presses ahead with a medicine it sees rivaling Biogen's Spinraza and Novartis's Zolgensma.</p>
      <p>ZURICH: Roche said on Monday its drug risdiplam helped people with type 2 or 3 spinal muscular atrophy improve their motor function, as the Swiss drugmaker presses ahead with a medicine it sees rivaling Biogen's Spinraza and Novartis's Zolgensma.</p>
      <p>"The study met its primary endpoint of change from baseline in the Motor Function Measure 32 scale after one year of treatment with risdiplam, compared to placebo," Roche said in a statement. "No treatment related safety findings leading to study withdrawal have been seen in any risdiplam trial to date."</p>
