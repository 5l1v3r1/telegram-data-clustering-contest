      <p>Hugh Grant is starring in Ritchie's latest film, The Gentleman, which is being filmed in London.</p>

      <p>The Seaforth Highlanders merged with the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders in 1961 to form the Queen's Own Highlanders (Seaforth and Camerons).</p>

      <p>Posting the images on social media, Guy Ritchie said: "This first picture was taken 65 years ago in Singapore where my dad - Captain John Ritchie - and Hugh Grant's dad - Captain James Grant - were stationed in the same regiment, the Seaforth Highlanders.</p>
      <p>"The second picture - taken on a film set in London 65 years later, has one grandson and two sons recreating that original image.</p>
      <p>"We'd discovered by co-incidence that Rory Gibb, our production assistant on the film's granddad was in that same original picture. You can see the resemblance."</p>
