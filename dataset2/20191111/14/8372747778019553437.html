      <p>Family members say the couple just welcomed their second child, a baby girl. Both of the couple's children were home at the time of the shooting.</p>
      <p>According to the family, the couple just moved back to Tampa because Peck’s father had cancer. He died in June.</p>
      <p>Detectives say their investigation led them to Kendrick. He was arrested on Friday without incident.</p>
      <p>Police have not provided information on what exactly led them to Kendrick or a possible motive for the crime.</p>
      <p>In addition to the two first-degree murder charges, Kendrick is charged with robbery with a firearm and possession of a firearm by felon.</p>
