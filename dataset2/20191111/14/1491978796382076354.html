      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/petedoherty">Pete Doherty</a> has reportedly been arrested in Paris for the second time in 48 hours.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/libertines">Libertines</a> and Babyshambles frontman was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/08/pete-doherty-arrested-paris">initially arrested in the Pigalle district in the early hours of Friday</a> for allegedly attempting to buy cocaine. He spent two days in police custody and was provisionally fined the equivalent of £4,300, a sentence yet to be approved by a judge, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7670569/Pete-Doherty-arrested-drunken-bar-fight-celebrated-released-police-cells.html">the Mail reports</a>.</p>
      <p>Doherty, 40, reportedly went out on Sunday wearing his pyjamas to celebrate his release. He was allegedly seen fighting in the Saint-Germain-des-Prés district with a 19-year-old male, who is believed to have filed a police complaint.</p>
      <p>Doherty faces new charges for violence by a person in a state of drunkenness.</p>
      <p>Arash Derambarsh, a lawyer for Doherty, told the Mail: “[Pete wanted to] go and celebrate his liberation in a bar near him. He drank and people made him drink.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/libertines">The Libertines</a> are due to start a European tour in Luxembourg on 17 November. Representatives for Doherty told the Guardian that his arrests should not affect the tour schedule.</p>
