      <h1>Craig Beattie questions Celtic title bottle as he makes Odsonne Edouard and Alfredo Morelos claim</h1>
      <h2>The former Hoops frontman has spoken out about the title battle between Celtic and Rangers.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T14:04:26+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 14:04</time> by <a rel="author">Mark McDougall, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mark-mcdougall/</a></address>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> striker Craig Beattie admits it will be interesting to watch how his old club deal with the pressure of a title race.</p>
      <p>Beattie spent four years as a first team player at Celtic Park, winning three SPL titles and two Scottish Cups.</p>
      <p>The current team have won the last eight titles but Beattie feels they are in a battle for the league flag with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> this season.</p>
      <p>The Ibrox side haven't been involved in a challenge for the title since they last won it in 2011 and many are wondering if they will be able to cope with the pressure later in the season.</p>
      <p>But Beattie reckons the same can be said for the Hoops as they look to clinch nine in a row.</p>

      <p>He told Sky Sports: "It’s impossible to say. Celtic have been across the distance and I discussed this yesterday when a very well known journalist said it would be interesting to see if Rangers had the bottle with three or four games to go. If they are in contention, will they have the bottle to stand up to potentially winning the league.</p>
      <p>"But I flipped the question and said ‘well, how do we know Celtic have the bottle’ because with three or games left to go, nobody has really been challenging them lately.</p>
      <p>"So I get what he’s saying from a Rangers perspective but from a Celtic perspective they’ve been running away winners for however many years now, so how will Celtic cope when the pressure is on with three games to go?"</p>
      <p>Both clubs have high scoring strikers with Alfredo Morelos grabbing his 22nd goal of the season while <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/odsonne-edouard">Odsonne Edouard</a> scored his 13th with the opener against Motherwell.</p>
      <p>The ongoing rivalry between fans about who has the better striker is continuing but while Beattie refused to get involved in that, he did give his views on which one was more important to their club at the present moment.</p>

      <p>He added: "At the minute, Celtic are very light up front with the exception of Edouard. So should he get injured or something happens to him, I think Edouard is more valuable at this point.</p>
      <p>"The goals <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alfredo-morelos">Alfredo Morelos</a> has been scoring - not just the numbers but the quality - has been absolutely exceptional. His disciplinary record appears to have been sorted and now he’s free scoring. The standard is fabulous. 22 goals in 19 starts, that’s 11 in Europe as well.</p>
      <p>"Alfredo Morelos is doing it on all fronts and has been a real find for Rangers. To mention Jermain Defoe, we’ve been singing Alfredo Morelos’ praises but Defoe’s actually got more league goals than Morelos which is quite unbelievable considering Morelos has played more games.</p>
      <p>"Celtic need to strengthen in January. Both need to strengthen, if I’m being honest. Rangers need to strengthen in terms of numbers because if something was to happen to Morelos then you’re relying on Defoe to play all the matches but Celtic really need to strengthen if something was to happen Edouard.</p>
      <p>"One or possibly two strikers."</p>
