      <h1>Riyad Mahrez makes Arsenal transfer admission as he rues wasted career opportunity</h1>
      <h2>The Manchester City winger was linked with a move to Arsenal in 2016 but remained at Leicester City for another two seasons before joining the Citizens</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T14:20:09+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 14:20</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Riyad Mahrez says his 2016 transfer to Arsenal was "nearly all done" - but <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester City</a> blocked him from leaving.</p>
      <p>The Foxes had just won a first Premier League title against all the odds and so began the top flight's elite picking apart their overachieving team.</p>
      <p>N'Golo Kante moved to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea,</a> Jamie Vardy was linked with a move to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal,</a> and Mahrez was seemingly already through the door at the Emirates.</p>
      <p>But according to the Algeria international, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> put their foot down and prevented him from leaving - a decision Mahrez describes as "frustrating".</p>
      <p>Mahrez told <a href="https://www.francefootball.fr/news/Riyad-mahrez-se-confie-dans-ff-j-ai-eu-ma-revanche/1079235">France Football:</a> "After the title, if I'd left for a top team, it wouldn't have been the same story.</p>
      <p>"For me, it's clear that I lost two years at the highest level. I lost two years! Because instead of arriving at City at 27, I could have been there at 24, 25.</p>

      <p>"Leicester blocked me. They told me: 'You're not leaving, you're not leaving'.</p>
      <p>"My agent had spoken to [Arsene] Wenger who really wanted me. It was nearly all done with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> in 2016. I was really frustrated.</p>
      <p>"It wasn't easy to go from being the best player in the Premier League to being a part of a team fighting against relegation.</p>
      <p>"It's not the same job. Everyone is waiting for you around the corner."</p>
      <p>Mahrez eventually got a dream move to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> after Pep Guardiola's side splashed out £60million to sign him.</p>

      <p>Reminiscing on his first day at City, Mahrez said: "He [Guardiola] was happy first. He said he was very happy to have me here.</p>
      <p>"He said we're going to make big things together with the team."</p>
