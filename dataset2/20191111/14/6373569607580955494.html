      <p>A "scumbag" who stole money from the poppy collection box at a Plymouth GP surgery has been shamed in the most brutal way.</p>
      <p>Knowle House Surgery practice manager Craig Smith-Avery has taken action after money was stolen from a charity collection box on site.</p>
      <p>It is believed the money, which was being raised for the Royal British Legion, was taken sometime on Friday as the box disappeared and was found empty in the waiting room.</p>
      <p>Now the GP practice has responded in the perfect way - by publicly shaming the thief and in no uncertain terms, telling them they are never allowed back.</p>
      <p>About the theft Mr Smith-Avery said: "It was Friday just after lunch and one of the girls went to find the box, it wasn’t there.</p>
      <p>"We couldn't find it and came to the conclusion someone swiped it.</p>
      <p>"I went for a wander and in a blind corner of the office it was ripped open and emptied.</p>

      <p>"I was disgusted. I'm ex-services, so that hurt. But stealing from charity in general is disgusting.</p>
      <p>"I notified the police and apologised to the Royal British Legion."</p>
      <p>Craig estimates there was between £50 and £80 taken. He said: "People have been good to put money in and support veterans and the fallen, and someone sees it as easy money.</p>
      <p>"It makes me sad and angry."</p>
      <p>He also placed a notice in the surgery informing the thief that they are no longer welcome at Knowle House. The message reads: "To the scumbag who stole the poppy box you are no longer welcome at our surgery.</p>
      <p>"You should hang your head in shame."</p>
      <p>The Royal British Legion is the country’s largest Armed Forces charity, with 235,000 members, 110,000 volunteers and a network of partners and charities.</p>
      <p>The police have been notified but won't be taking further action, it has been reported on Radio Plymouth.</p>
