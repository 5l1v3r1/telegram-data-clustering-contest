      <p>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — A nonprofit group which helps at-risk horses is reporting a series of stabbings involving horses in North Carolina and South Carolina.</p>
      <p>The Charlotte Observer reports Fleet of Angels says there were instances on Sunday of some horses found stabbed in their pastures. The first incident was on Sept. 25, when a retired horse in Columbus, North Carolina, was found bleeding out from a cut on his back leg.</p>
      <p>The Polk County Sheriff’s Office in North Carolina verified some incidents over the border last week. A social media post said that while no livestock had been attacked in the county, there had been reports of attacks on horses in Spartanburg County in South Carolina.</p>
      <p>Most of the incidents reported were within 10 miles (16 kilometers) of Campobello, a small town north of Greenville, South Carolina.</p>
