      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: The office of Julie Elliott, MP for Sunderland Central, was ambushed at around 10pm on Saturday night, just a few days after the general election campaign kicked off</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T14:25:18+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 14:25</time> by <a rel="author">Tanveer Mann, https://www.facebook.com/tanveermannjournalist</a></address>
      <p>A Labour MP's constituency office windows have been smashed in a "deliberate" late night attack over the weekend.</p>
      <p>The office of Julie Elliott, MP for Sunderland Central, was ambushed at around 10pm on Saturday night, just a few days after the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">general election</a> campaign kicked off.</p>
      <p>Mrs Elliott, who is preparing to stand in the upcoming election on December 12, called the attack 'unsettling' and said it was 'not acceptable'.</p>
      <p>She told <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/">Mirror Online</a> : "It's clear it was a deliberate attack. People who do this are just bullies but I won't cower down to it.</p>
      <p>"It is not acceptable but my first priority is that my staff are okay.</p>

      <p>"We just have to try to make sure police can catch whoever did this. I don’t mind anyone having a political disagreement with me but this is not how we behave."</p>
      <p>Mrs Elliott said she was relieved that the attack happened on a Saturday when her staff don't work.</p>
      <p>She would typically have had around six members of staff in the office if it had been a weekday.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> MP said: "It's been quite encouraging on social media to see supportive messages from across the party spectrum. Local Tories have openly said it is not good. "</p>
      <p>Mrs Elliot was first elected as MP for Sunderland Central in 2010.</p>

      <p>She has also served as chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Rugby Union and vice-chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on State Pension Inequality for Women.</p>
      <p>Last week, MPs voted to hold the first general election during winter time since February 1974, in order to break the parliamentary deadlock over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> .</p>
      <p>Since then MPs have been warned not to go out alone or after dark during the campaign.</p>
      <p>Discussing her own security, Elliott said: "Extra security for female MPs has been a part of our daily life for the last couple of years. It is very, very sad that we have to watch everything that we do, but we have to take steps to stay safe."</p>
      <p>Elliott's son Miles also tweeted about the attack, saying: "My mam’s office was bricked on Saturday.</p>
      <p>"Politicians and their staff are not fair game, they are people doing their jobs to the best of their ability and with good intentions.</p>
      <p>"Disagree with them and campaign against them by all means but haway - we’re better than this."</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Northumbria Police told Mirror Online: "Shortly before 11.15pm on Saturday (November 9), police received a report of criminal damage at an address on Norfolk Street, Sunderland.</p>
      <p>“It was reported that a man had smashed two windows of the premises and was acting aggressively.</p>
      <p>"Officers attended but the individual had already left the area.</p>
      <p>“An investigation has been launched and enquiries are ongoing to trace those involved.</p>
      <p>“We would like to reiterate that intentional acts of criminal damage are totally unacceptable and we will take appropriate action against anybody found responsible.”</p>
