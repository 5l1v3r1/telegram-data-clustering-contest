      <p>The family of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/sheku-bayoh">Sheku Bayoh</a> today told how they felt “totally betrayed” by a decision not to prosecute anyone over his death.</p>
      <p>Gas engineer <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/father-two-who-died-police-5634392">Sheku died in May 2015 after being restrained</a> by up to nine police officers near his Kirkcaldy home.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old, who had taken the drugs MDMA and Flakka, was found to have suffered 23 separate injuries.</p>
      <p>His family met with prosecutors this morning at the Crown Office building in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> .</p>
      <p>They were left devastated after being told no criminal charges would be pursued in the case.</p>
      <p>Sheku’s mum Aminata Bayoh, 70, said: “I returned back to Scotland last week to attend this meeting. But my heart is broken again to hear this decision.</p>
      <p>“My only son died in the hands of police who are supposed to have protected him.”</p>

      <p>Colette Bell, Sheku’s partner, said: “I believe that if the police hadn’t treated my Sheku the way they did, he would be here today.</p>
      <p>“I am fed up of the lies and the attempt to blame Sheku for his own death.”</p>
      <p>The Bayoh family’s solicitor Aamer Anwar said: “They feel totally betrayed by the Lord Advocate, for not holding power to account, for his broken promises, his betrayal of justice and failure to act in the public interest.</p>
      <p>“Neither the family or the legal team accept the Crown’s reasoning for no criminal charges.</p>
      <p>“The Lord Advocate has presided over a four-and-a-half year investigation which was deeply flawed from the moment Sheku lost his life.”</p>
      <p>The family are calling for a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/sheku-bayohs-family-call-justice-14986559">public inquiry into Sheku’s death</a> .</p>
      <p>The decision on whether there should be a public inquiry will be made by the Scottish government.</p>
