      <p>As spotted by kartanym, the last game drawn by Vanna was <i>GRIS</i>. It's back in the news again today, but you can <a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2019/11/french-dev-says-plagiarising-devolver-digital-game-was-an-unintentional-mistake/">catch up on that here.</a></p>
      <p>However, we've got a new game to guess. Let's see how you do.</p>
      <p>You have <i>definitely</i> heard of this game. 1000 percent. It would be next to impossible for anyone to have not heard of this game.</p>
      <p>Good luck!</p>
