      <h1>A OnePlus 8 Pro Prototype Has Already Been Spotted in the Wild</h1>

      <p>The OnePlus 7T range hasn't been out for very long, but it's as though that opened up the floodgates for rumours and leaks regarding the OnePlus 8 series - due sometime in Spring 2020. In fact someone has been spotted carrying around what appears to be a prototype version of the OnePlus 8 Pro - complete with a holepunch camera.</p>

      <p>Yes, interestingly it looks like OnePlus may be ditching the pop-up camera already, because this in-screen camera is part of what appears to be the Pro model - complete with the curved display and the vertical camera array, as opposed to the circular camera array that debuted on the OnePlus 7T.</p>
      <p>Other points of note are that the camera array looks different than the 7 Pro and 7T Pro (the flash has moved up for some reason), and the back of the phone says 'OnePlus 5G'. Of course there are questions as to whether this is legit, since someone could easily make a fake, though there is an alert slider and the tweet seems adamant that this is the OxygenOS app drawer. Not that it looks much different to an app drawer on any cleaner version of Android.</p>
      <p>But at this early stage it's likely that this isn't the final design. Perhaps its a prototype for various features that will be split apart when the 8 and 8 Pro come out; maybe it's a specific model to succeed the 7 Pro 5G that'll be different to the normal 8 Pro; or maybe these features won't even arrive on the final models. It's too early to say, really, and when we hear more we'll be sure to keep you updated.
