      <p>PUTRAJAYA (Nov 11): The government will take the necessary corrective measures if there is anything wrong with Malaysia's civil aviation authority, said Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad.</p>
      <p>Asked on reports that the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has downgraded Malaysia’s air safety rating, Dr Mahathir said he had no knowledge about the details but would look into it and "find out why".</p>
      <p>"We will correct the situation, so that the whole world will respect Malaysia's aviation authority," he told a news conference after chairing Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (Bersatu) meeting here today. Dr Mahathir is Bersatu chairman.</p>
      <p>According to a <i>Reuters</i> report, the FAA has downgraded Malaysia’s air safety rating, restricting the country’s airlines from adding flights to the United States.</p>
      <p>According to the report, Malaysia has been downgraded to Category 2.</p>
      <p>Asked whether he had been notified on the 'downgrade' rating, Dr Mahathir said: "No, I have not." <i>— Bernama</i></p>
