      <p>MADISON, Wis. - Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers has issued eight more pardons.</p>
      <p>Evers issued the pardons Sunday, a month after issuing Wisconsin's first pardons in nine years.</p>
      <p>The Democratic governor says pardons "play a very important role in our criminal justice system and society by giving deserving folks a second chance."</p>
      <p>Evers re-started the pardons board in June and issued his first pardons, to four people, in October. Evers' predecessor, Republican Scott Walker, never issued a single pardon over his eight years as governor.</p>
      <p>The latest pardons were recommended by Wisconsin's pardons board.</p>
      <p>Among those pardoned are a 36-year-old man for possessing marijuana and carrying a concealed weapon convictions he received at age 22, and a 59-year-old woman who sought a pardon for her role in stealing and selling hot tubs in 2004.</p>
