      <p>MUMBAI: In a setback, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling party has decided not to form the government in the western state of Maharashtra - the country's richest - leaving opposition groups scrambling on Monday (Nov 11) to cobble together an alliance.</p>
      <p>The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) emerged as the single largest party in a state election in Maharashtra last month, and was expected to comfortably retain power with the help of its regional ally, the Shiv Sena.</p>

      <p>But in-fighting between the BJP and the Shiv Sena, which has gone on for a fortnight, has culminated in the allies parting ways, dealing the first major political blow to Modi's ruling party since it retained power with a landslide mandate in a May general election.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, the BJP's state president Chandrakant Patil said his party had decided to not stake claim to form government.</p>
      <p>Shiv Sena, which is still officially part of a ruling alliance led by the BJP, is now trying to form a government in Maharashtra with support of opposition parties, a senior party official said on Monday.</p>
      <p>"We have required numbers to form the government and we will prove it," the Shiv Sena official said, declining to be named.</p>
      <p>In a tweet on Monday, the Shiv Sena's Arvind Sawant, the federal Minister of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises, also quit from Modi government.</p>
      <p>Whereas the BJP and Shiv Sena share Hindu nationalist sentiments, Shiv Sena's political base in Maharashtra is the Hindu Marathi community.</p>
      <p>Maharashtra - home to India's financial capital Mumbai - has a 288-member assembly, meaning Shiv Sena, which won 56 seats, will need the support of other parties to be able to come to power.</p>
      <p>Leaders from the opposition Congress Party and the Nationalist Congress Party were meeting separately on Monday to decide on the possibility of an alliance with the Shiv Sena.</p>
      <p>If no single party or alliance is able to stake claim to forming a government, then the state could be put under the direct supervision of the federal government until fresh elections are called.</p>
