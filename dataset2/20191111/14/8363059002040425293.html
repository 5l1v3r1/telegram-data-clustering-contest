      <h1>TalkTalk Thinks it's Black Friday Already, and Has Discounted the Internet (Again)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T14:30:20+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 14:30</time> by <a rel="author">Gavin Whenman</a></address>
      <p>That most unnecessary yet generous of sales seasons, Black Friday, might not be until 29th November, a good two and a half weeks away, but that hasn't stopped <a href="https://www.talktalk.co.uk/shop/broadband/fibre">TalkTalk from unveiling its deals</a>.</p>
      <p>From today until 5th December, you can grab a discount on TalkTalk's fibre broadband packages. The 'Faster Fibre' package (average download speed 38Mb) is now £21.95 a month, provided you get an 18 month contract, while the 'Superfast Fibre' package (average speed 67Mb) is currently £24.95 a month, again if you're willing to commit for a year and a half. The good news is all those prices include line rental.</p>
      <p>As you would expect TalkTalk also promises unlimited usage, will supply a Wi-Fi router, and promises a fixed price for 18 months. All of those are awfully nice gestures, even though most broadband providers offer the same sort of stuff. But some of them don't, so it's worth mentioning anyway. There are also no fees for setup or equipment delivery, which can't be said for some of the others, so that's an added bonus for you.</p>
      <p>If you want to add TV to your package, TalkTalk is being extra-munificent and not only knocking money off their plans, but giving everyone a year's worth of Amazon Prime, even if you've already got it. You can grab Faster Fibre broadband with TalkTalk TV and Amazon Prime for £25.95 a month (previously £40) and Superfast Fibre broadband with TalkTalk TV and Amazon Prime for £28.95 a month (previously £45). Be warned though, there are only a limited number of Amazon Prime codes, so you'll have to be quick. But don't worry, if you are an existing Prime customer, you membership will be extended by 12 months when you redeem the code.
