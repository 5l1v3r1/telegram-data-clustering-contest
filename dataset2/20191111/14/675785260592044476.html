      <h1>BREAKING British Steel saved after £70million deal with Chinese firm Jingye</h1>
      <h2>China's Jingye Group has agreed to buy British Steel in a deal worth £70million that could protect 4,000 UK jobs</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T14:15:12+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 14:15</time> by <a rel="author">James Andrews, http://www.facebook.com/jameswritesmoney/</a></address>
      <p>Chinese firm Jingye Group has said it will buy British Steel for £70million - safeguarding 4,000 jobs at the company and as many as 20,000 in the supply chain, the Insolvency Service has confirmed.</p>
      <p>The takeover ends uncertainty over the fate of the company, which was put into compulsory liquidation in May after Greybull Capital, which bought it for £1 from Tata Steel three years ago, failed to secure funding to continue its operations.</p>
      <p>Jingye is a privately owned Chinese corporation founded and led by Li Ganpo a former senior Communist Party official who became a self-made industrial tycoon.</p>

      <p>Jingye also looks set to promise up to £300million in loans, indemnities and grants to back its plan to boost production at the firm's Scunthorpe plant by 10%.</p>
      <p>British Steel, which makes products used in construction and rail, would give Jingye access to Europe's large infrastructure market.</p>
      <p>News of the deal broke after staff were sent an email from Sam Woodward, a special manager from accountancy EY that is assisting the Official Receiver, reading: "As you are aware, Jingye has been undertaking accelerated due diligence for the last two weeks, and I am pleased to advise that it is progressing well.</p>
      <p>"As many of you may know, we have been working towards a target date of exchanging contracts by 10 November 2019 and we are all working hard to keep to that timescale."</p>
      <p>It added than an update was expected today.</p>
