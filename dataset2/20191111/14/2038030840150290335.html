      <p>Cape Town - Zolani Mahola loved and known internationally as the face and voice of Freshlyground, is taking centre stage in her first one-woman show, <i>The One Who Sings</i> (from the <i>Xhosa Lo Uculayo</i>) from 19 –23 of November 2019 at the <a href="http://www.baxter.co.za/"><b>Baxter Theatre in Cape Town.</b></a></p>
      <p>Along with captivating storytelling, Zolani interweaves her original new music with some of her most well-known songs, taking the audience on an intimate journey through the eyes of a young girl growing up in a divided 1980's South Africa, opening up for the first time about her struggles in a country which is itself grappling with its own wounds and sense of identity.</p>
      <p>She courageously shares details from her life; from her tumultuous childhood and adolescence to becoming an artist and national icon, opening the 2010 FIFA World Cup, and all the many personal and professional triumphs and challenges along the way.</p>
      <p>"I've decided it's time for me to share myself in a way I have never done before, and preparing for this show has been a huge part of my healing process," says Zolani. "Through telling my story, I want to use my voice to gently challenge my fellow humans to rise above our current narrative to create a greater national story."</p>
      <p>Zolani believes that South Africa is at such a critical point in its history and that our old narratives are no longer working. This is why her raw and honest story of hope and resilience comes at such a crucial time. Collaborating with multi-award-winning director Faniswa Yisa, whose performances in recent years include Reza de Wet's <i>Missing</i>, <i>Ityala Lamawela, Born in the RSA</i> and <i>What Remains</i>, for which she won a Best Actress Award at the 2018 Fleur du Cap Awards, this unique performance evokes powerful and provocative universal themes, leaving audiences feeling both deeply moved and inspired.</p>
