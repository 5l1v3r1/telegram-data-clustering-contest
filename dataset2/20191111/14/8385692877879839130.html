      <p>Walmart is <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">bundling</a> the Google Home Mini and Chromecast, and putting it on sale for just $45. The Google Home Mini is normally $50 by itself. That makes this a really great deal.</p>
      <p>Sure these two products from Google are a few years old – and one has been replaced already. But that doesn't make this a bad deal.</p>
      <p>The Google Home Mini is essentially the same as the Nest Mini that just launched last month. With just a few differences, and a new name. The Chromecast, however, is still getting updates and running strong.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>The Chromecast is going to allow you to Cast all sorts of content to your TV, from your smartphone. And this includes the new Disney+ service that is launching on November 12. So you're going to be able to watch all of your favorite Disney movies and shows on the big screen, without spending a ton on a streaming device.</p>
      <p>Google Home Mini still has the Google Assistant built-in, so you can ask it to do all sorts of things – including playing Netflix on the Chromecast. It will also work for controlling your other smart home devices in your home, as well as giving you information. Like the weather, the current news and so forth. This makes it a really great smart speaker to add to your home. Of course, we cannot forget that this is also a smart speaker and can play music from a variety of sources. Like Google Play Music, YouTube Music, Amazon Music Unlimited, Spotify and much more.</p>
      <p>This bundle of the Google Home Mini and Chromecast is only available at Walmart, so if you are looking for this bundle, make sure you get it before it's gone.</p>
