      <h1>Landlords could owe tenants £320 each - all because of a new law</h1>
      <h2>The Tenant Fees Act 2019 was introduced back in June - and means anybody living in privately-rented accommodation could now be owed a windfall</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T14:02:53+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 14:02</time> by <a rel="author">James Rodger, Rachel Pugh, https://www.facebook.com/jamesrodgerjournalist</a></address>
      <p>Tenants could be owed refunds worth hundreds of pounds from landlords - all thanks to a new law.</p>
      <p>Tenancy fees were banned as part of new legislation earlier this year, with deposits capped at five weeks rent.</p>
      <p>The Tenant Fees Act 2019 was introduced back in June - and means anybody living in privately-rented accommodation could now be owed a windfall.</p>
      <p>Our sister title in the North West, <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/business/property/property-law-landlords-owe-money-17235893">the Manchester Evening News</a> , reports holding deposits were also capped at a weeks' rent under the new legislation.</p>

      <p>What many renters don't know, though, is that the legislation also means that landlord or agent responsible for letting the property must return any part of the deposit which exceeds the maximum cap which was introduced as part of the Tenant Fees Act 2019.</p>
      <p>Government-approved protection scheme the Tenancy Deposit Scheme (TDS) has said that on average, private renters have been given refunds of around £320 each.</p>
      <p>Debbie Davies, Assistant Director of Business Development at the TDS, said: "We reviewed data from when the legislation was first introduced in order to establish how frequently deposits are being partially repaid by agents or landlords.</p>
      <p>"During this period we have made 2,550 repayments totalling £817,031.33.</p>
      <p>"From delving deeper into the figures we identified the average payment was £320.27 and the highest repayment to a tenant was £3,384.62.</p>
      <p>"We believe the deposit cap is having the effect intended by Parliament, with the deposit held being reduced upon renewal, which is great news for renters."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>If you think you are owed money from your landlord and have protected your deposit under the TDS, you can call 0300 037 1001 for more information and guidance.</p>
