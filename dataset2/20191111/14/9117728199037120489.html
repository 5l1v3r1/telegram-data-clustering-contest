        <b>Michael Schumacher's former team boss Flavio Briatore says that the German driver was close to quitting F1 following the death of his rival Ayrton Senna in 1994. Schumacher was chasing Senna down at Imola when the Williams man ran off track and had his fatal accident.</b>

      <p>Schumacher went on to win the title that year, his first of seven, but it could have been far different if he had decided to stop following that terrible San Marino Grand Prix, which also saw the death of Roland Ratzenberger.</p>

      <p>Senna and Schumacher were set for a titanic battle for titles, but we never got to see the potential thrill of two greats going head to head.</p>
      <p>Briatore told German newspaper Kölner Express: <i>"He changed after Ayrton Senna's death. He seriously considered stopping racing, but fortunately for us, he stayed."</i></p>
      <p>F1 would have looked pretty different without Schumacher! </p>
