      <h1>Clare Balding leads new BT campaign to show more women's football in UK pubs</h1>
      <h2>The Red Lion in the City of London has been transformed to the Red Lioness as part of a new BT Sport initiative</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T14:32:12+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 14:32</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Lawless, https://www.facebook.com/MattLawlessMirror/</a></address>
      <p>A London pub has received a radical makeover to promote women’s football.</p>
      <p>The Red Lion boozer in the City has been aptly re-named The Red Lioness for the next week and decorated with memorabilia, trophies and iconic photography.</p>
      <p>It is part of a major BT Sport initiative to increase the profile of the game domestically, with 750 Greene King venues around the country signing up to a pledge to showcase some of the top women’s matches.</p>
      <p>The Red Lioness will host a number of events to celebrate and promote women’s football with BT Sport’s women’s football experts.</p>
      <p>And it includes a screening of this weekend’s North London Derby between <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> Hotspur and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> Women - the first WSL match to be played at the new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.</p>

      <p>BT Sport presenter Clare Balding is among the high profile names - including Arsenal striker Danielle Carter and Reading midfielder Fara Williams - backing the campaign to show more women’s football in pubs.</p>
      <p>“I love the new branding of the Red Lion as the Red Lioness as it amplifies the support for the Lionesses as they expand their fan base,” she said, speaking before England were beaten 2-1 against Germany in front of 90,000 fans at Wembley.</p>
      <p>"The sold out game at Wembley is just the start of a major wave of support for the women’s game in this country.</p>
      <p>"Pubs have always been a place where people congregate to watch football and I hope many more will join the Red Lioness Pledge.”</p>

      <p>This season is BT Sport’s biggest season of women’s football yet, with more matches than ever before.</p>
      <p>Over the whole campaign, they will broadcast at least 30 live women’s football matches - including the Lionesses, Barclays FA Women’s Super League, FA Women’s Continental League Cup and the Women’s FA Cup.</p>
      <p>Pete Jeavons, marketing communications director, BT, said: “BT is proud to have broadcast women’s football since 2013 and we are committed to helping grow the women’s game.</p>
      <p>"We would encourage any football fans to visit the Red Lioness and take in some fantastic experiences over the coming days.”</p>
