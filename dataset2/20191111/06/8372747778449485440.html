      <p>LEE COUNTY, Fla. – A Fort Myers judge has denied a motion for a new trial for Jimmy Rodgers.</p>
      <p>Last month, Rodgers was <a href="https://www.fox4now.com/news/local-news/jury-finds-jimmy-rodger-guilty-of-2nd-degree-murder">convicted of killing Dr. Teresa Sievers</a> in her Bonita Springs home in 2015.</p>
      <p>But last week, his attorney <a href="https://www.fox4now.com/news/local-news/jimmy-rodgers-files-request-for-new-trial">filed a motion to get a new trial</a> . He believes evidence that prosecutors filed days before the trial would have proved Rodgers' innocence.</p>
      <p>While Rodgers’ attorneys continue to fight for a new trial, jury selection will start Tuesday for Teresa's husband, Mark Sievers.</p>
      <p>Investigators say Mark hired Rodgers and Curtis Wright to kill Teresa for insurance money.</p>
