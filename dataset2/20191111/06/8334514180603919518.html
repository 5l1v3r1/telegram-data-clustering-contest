      <p>Ryan Tannehill fired a decisive 23-yard touchdown pass to Adam Humphries with 23 seconds remaining Sunday, and the Tennessee Titans stunned the Kansas City Chiefs, 35-32, in Nashville, Tenn.</p>

      <p>Harrison Butker, who made a field goal as time expired to enable the Chiefs to beat Minnesota last week, had a 52-yard attempt blocked at the buzzer. Tannehill passed for 181 yards and two touchdowns, and Derrick Henry rushed for 188 yards and two more scores.</p>
      <p>On their previous possession, the Chiefs (6-4) lined up for a field goal after going three-and-out inside the final two minutes, but holder Dustin Colquitt could not handle the snap and was flagged for intentional grounding on a desperation pass.</p>
      <p>Tannehill and the Titans (5-5) took over and covered 61 yards in four plays to spoil the return of Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who missed the two previous games with a dislocated knee. Mahomes, playing with a brace on his right knee, passed for 446 yards, going 36 of 50, with three touchdowns.</p>
      <p>Packers 24, Panthers 16</p>
      <p>Preston Smith stopped Christian McCaffrey inside the 1-yard line on the game’s final play, and Green Bay survived Carolina’s lengthy, last-minute drive to win at snowy Lambeau Field.</p>
      <p>McCaffrey was stopped on second-and-goal from the 2 — with the ruling upheld upon review — ending an 18-play, 88-yard drive by the Panthers (5-4) that included a fourth-and-10 conversion from quarterback Kyle Allen to D.J. Moore.</p>
      <p>The Packers (8-2) rode three touchdowns from Aaron Jones and 156 combined rushing yards from Jones and Jamaal Williams. Aaron Rodgers finished 17 of 29 for 233 yards.</p>
      <p>Falcons 26, Saints 9</p>
      <p>Matt Ryan threw two touchdown passes, and visiting Atlanta ended a six-game losing streak by stopping New Orleans’ six-game winning streak.</p>
      <p>Ryan, who completed 20 of 35 for 182 yards, threw scoring passes of 8 yards to Austin Hooper and 10 yards to Brian Hill for the game’s only touchdowns. The Falcons (2-7) limited Drew Brees and the Saints’ offense to three Wil Lutz field goals.</p>
      <p>Brees, playing in his second game after a five-game absence due to thumb surgery, completed 32 of 45 passes for 287 yards and was sacked six times by a defense that had seven sacks total entering the game.</p>
      <p>Steelers 17, Rams 12</p>
      <p>Mason Rudolph passed for 242 yards and a touchdown to James Washington to complement a strong Pittsburgh defense in a win over visiting Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>The Steelers (5-4), who won their fourth straight game, held the Rams (5-4) without an offensive touchdown and had four takeaways.</p>
      <p>Washington had six receptions for 90 yards, including the touchdown, which tied the game at 7-7 at the end of the first quarter. Minkah Fitzpatrick had a fumble recovery and return for a touchdown and sealed the win with an interception with 20 seconds left.</p>
      <p>Ravens 49, Bengals 13</p>
      <p>Lamar Jackson threw three touchdown passes and scored on a long run as visiting Baltimore ripped Cincinnati.</p>
      <p>Jackson completed his first 11 passes, two of those touchdowns to Mark Andrews. He also scored on a 47-yard run, fooling a pair of defenders with a spin move before accelerating into the end zone.</p>
      <p>The Bengals (0-9), the NFL’s lone winless team, didn’t appear to have solved anything even as they came off an open week on the schedule. Rookie Ryan Finley ended up 16 for 30 for 167 yards with a touchdown and an interception. He replaced Andy Dalton, who was benched after eight games, as the starter.</p>
      <p>Bears 20, Lions 13</p>
      <p>Mitch Trubisky threw for 173 yards and three touchdowns to help host Chicago snap a four-game losing streak with a victory against Detroit.</p>
      <p>The Bears (4-5) won for the first time since Week 4 to take sole possession of third place in the NFC North. The Lions (3-5-1), playing without injured starting quarterback Matthew Stafford, lost for the fifth time in six games.</p>
      <p>Backup quarterback Jeff Driskel’s fourth-down pass toward the end zone from the Bears’ 25-yard line fell incomplete as time expired. Stafford missed the game with what ESPN reported were multiple fractures in his back, snapping a streak of 136 consecutive starts, the sixth-longest by a quarterback in NFL history.</p>
      <p>Browns 19, Bills 16</p>
      <p>Baker Mayfield found Rashard Higgins for a 7-yard touchdown pass with 1:44 remaining to help Cleveland snap a four-game losing streak by defeating visiting Buffalo.</p>
      <p>Buffalo’s Stephen Hauschka missed a 53-yard field-goal attempt with 17 seconds to go. It was his second missed field-goal try of the game.</p>
      <p>Mayfield finished 26 of 38 for 238 yards and two touchdowns for the Browns (3-6), who had been 0-3 at home. Nick Chubb ran for 116 yards on 20 carries. Cleveland’s winning drive went 82 yards in 10 plays, taking 3:42.</p>
      <p>Jets 34, Giants 27</p>
      <p>Le’Veon Bell’s 1-yard touchdown run eight seconds into the fourth quarter gave the “host” Jets the lead for good, as they defeated the Giants in a battle of skidding New York teams who share MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J.</p>
      <p>The Jets (2-7) snapped a three-game losing streak, while the Giants (2-8) have lost six straight. Quarterback Sam Darnold threw for 230 yards and accounted for two touchdowns — one passing and one rushing — for the Jets. Safety Jamal Adams had two sacks and two forced fumbles and scored the other touchdown by stripping the ball from Giants quarterback Daniel Jones and racing untouched into the end zone for a 25-yard score early in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>Jones connected on 26 of 40 passes for 308 yards and four touchdowns — two apiece to Golden Tate and Darius Slayton — but was sacked six times. The Giants had just 23 yards on 17 carries, including 1 yard on 13 carries by Saquon Barkley.</p>
      <p>Buccaneers 30, Cardinals 27</p>
      <p>Jameis Winston passed for 358 yards and a touchdown, and Peyton Barber scored the go-ahead touchdown on a 1-yard run with 1:43 remaining as host Tampa Bay broke a four-game losing streak at the expense of Arizona.</p>
      <p>Ronald Jones had 106 yards from scrimmage and rushed for a touchdown, and O.J. Howard caught a scoring pass from Winston, who engineered the 10th fourth-quarter comeback of his career as the Bucs (3-6) played their first game in Raymond James Stadium in 49 days.</p>
      <p>Kyler Murray completed 27 of 44 passes for 324 yards and tied a career high with three touchdowns. Christian Kirk caught all three scores while setting career highs in receiving yards (138) and touchdowns as the Cardinals (3-6-1) lost their third straight.</p>
      <p>Dolphins 16, Colts 12</p>
      <p>Miami’s defense intercepted Brian Hoyer three times, and kicker Jason Sanders boomed three long field goals, including the go-ahead and insurance kicks in the fourth quarter of an upset in Indianapolis.</p>
      <p>Sanders’ 48-yarder with 5:45 left in the game gave the Dolphins (2-7) a 13-12 lead, and another 48-yarder just over two minutes later upped the lead to four. That occurred five plays after Nik Needham intercepted Hoyer at the Indianapolis 35.</p>
      <p>The Colts’ final drive ended at the Dolphins’ 8 when Hoyer’s fourth-down pass to tight end Eric Ebron came up 2 yards shy of a first down, as Needham made the tackle with 45 seconds remaining. Hoyer, making his first start in two years as Jacoby Brissett (knee) sat out, finished 18 of 39 for 204 yards.</p>
      <p>Vikings 28, Cowboys 24</p>
      <p>Kirk Cousins completed 23 of 32 passes for 220 yards and two touchdowns, both to tight end Kyle Rudolph, and Minnesota held on for a win over host Dallas in Arlington, Texas.</p>
