      <h2>Keith feels that the women running the Edinburgh clubs have a big job on their hands to sail their respective ships back to calm waters.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T06:00:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Keith Jackson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/keith-jackson/</a></address>
      <p>It's time for the two ladies to start feeling some heat.</p>
      <p>If <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ann-budge">Ann Budge</a> and Leeann Dempster have enjoyed a relatively easy ride of things up until now then the first flames of crisis are now licking away at their toes.</p>
      <p>Yes, both Hearts and Hibs enjoyed some much needed respite on Saturday with hefty wins which will have allowed both Budge and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/leeann-dempster">Dempster</a> to mop the gathering sweat from their brows.</p>
      <p>But if they think a few victories over St Mirren and St Johnstone are enough to dig them out of the turmoil they have created for their respective clubs then they may be in the wrong business after all.</p>
      <p>Let’s get the obvious elephant out of the room where the two of them are concerned,</p>
      <p>It almost feels as if they deserve be treated more gently than all the other decision makers and shot callers up and down Scottish football simply because of their gender, which is a fundamental unfairness and a form of discrimination in itself.</p>
      <p>We’re talking here about two highly successful, astute and powerful females. Any attempt to mollycoddle women of such substance would be to patronise and insult them.</p>
      <p>That they both have credit in the bank is beyond dispute. Budge will always be the heroic leader who hauled Hearts from the gutter. <br/>Dempster the chief executive who got her hands on a Scottish Cup.</p>

      <p>But even so it’s reached a vaguely ridiculous point where it feels almost sacrosanct to point a finger of blame at either of their doors even when their respective houses are in real danger of falling down.</p>
      <p>Because that’s the bottom line in all of this. Hearts and Hibs have got themselves into a horrible mess and unless the women in charge start doing something meaningful about it then one or both of them could end up back in the second tier of Scottish football next season.</p>
      <p>When you really stop to think about it, Dempster is fortunate indeed that her jacket is not already hanging on the shakiest peg in the Easter Road dressing room. You know, the very one she used to loiter outside, shaking her head in horror when Neil Lennon was inside letting rip at his players.</p>
      <p>That Lennon was in Rome last week leading <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> to a historic Europa League victory over Lazio tells a damning story of Dempster’s own flawed judgement.</p>
      <p>She had a manager capable of achievements of such magnitude in her grasp. And she effectively chased him out of the door because she didn’t approve of industrial language in the work place.</p>
      <p>It seemed absurd at the time – and remember Hibs were eventually forced to confirm that Lennon was suspended from his position for no discernible reason – then it looks now with the benefit of hindsight like an act of professional sabotage.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>If Paul Heckingbottom had not failed so spectacularly as Lennon’s replacement then Dempster might have got away with it.</p>
      <p>But the fact of the matter is while Lennon was busy ripping up Italian soil last week, Dempster was starting the search for a new manager with her crisis ravaged side hovering just above over the Premiership trapdoor.</p>
      <p>It was not all that long ago, after all, that Lennon had them in Europe and yet it feels now like a lifetime ago.</p>
      <p>So, yes, the torch must now be shone on Dempster’s desk as she attempts to get her club back on track.</p>
      <p>She could do something very obvious like picking up the phone to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/gordon-strachan">Gordon Strachan</a> and asking the former Scotland manager to ride to the rescue of his own boyhood club. If she did make such a call then Strachan would find it hard to resist such an emotional homecoming, even though he is just getting his teeth into his new role as technical director at Dundee.</p>
      <p>Even if Strachan, at the age of 62, feels his future is now above dugout level then it’s impossible to think that he would turn down an SOS from his first love. There is no reason at all why he could not plot a new direction for the club from a comfy seat up the stairs while acting as a sounding board and mentor for an ambitious younger coach.</p>
      <p>The name of former club captain Kevin Thomson, for example, has already been floated as a potential outsider for the job because of his highly impressive work in the youth department at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> .</p>

      <p>The idea of such an alliance between Strachan and Thomson might help to reignite some of the passion that Heckingbottom managed to suck out of the club over these last nine miserable months. But would Dempster be attracted to such a high profile team? Or would she be quietly terrified at the thought of having to deal with Strachan’s demands given her experiences with Lennon, who had become too much of a handful long before he was shown the door.</p>
      <p>Across the capital, Budge too has shown a difficulty for dealing with big personalities in a very different way.</p>
      <p>It would appear the Hearts chair no longer trusts her own judgement, at least in terms of football decisions.</p>
      <p>It seems the only explanation for Levein’s continued presence at Tynecastle despite Budge finally feeling she was left with no other option but to remove him from his director of football and manager roles.</p>
      <p>In what other part of her business portfolio would she sack one man from two jobs over his incompetence only to create another position for him on the same day? Then use him as a consultant where the next big decision is concerned?</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>This really is a bewildering state of affairs and the sight of Austin MacPhee touting himself for any other job that might be going, is as unedifying as it is preposterous. MacPhee was part of the whole <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ian-cathro">Ian Cathro</a> abomination. Levein’s right-hand man.</p>
      <p>Budge should be chasing him half-way down Gorgie Road rather than considering him for promotion and a pay rise.</p>
      <p>Talk from the weekend suggests the club is in no rush to make any appointments. It also suggests McPhee will be happy for the chance of an extended run as caretaker and a long, drawn out audition for the role.</p>
      <p>That thought should strike fear into the heart of a support which Budge seems determined to ignore and, at times, to patronise even though these fans are bankrolling her empire.</p>
      <p>Budge will have to do a great deal better than this if she is to reclaim some sort of control over her club and reestablish her reputation. Dempster too must prove that the flames are not getting out of hand.</p>
      <p>If not, it will only get hotter.</p>
