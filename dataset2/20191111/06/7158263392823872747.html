      <p>Today in objectively horrible news that will make you sick to your stomach, an obstetrician-gynecologist in Chesapeake, Virginia has been accused of performing <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/health-fitness/a17844080/lena-dunham-total-hysterectomy/">hysterectomies</a> on patients who didn't agree to them.</p>
      <p>A 69-year-old doctor named Javaid Perwaiz has been charged after the FBI got a tip from a hospital employee who suspected he was "performing unnecessary surgeries on unsuspecting patients," according to <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/virginia-doctor-allegedly-tied-womens-fallopian-tubes-performed/story?id=66893437">ABC News</a>. The patients were allegedly unaware of the procedures they were undergoing.</p>
      <p>After one of his patients who came in for an ectopic pregnancy later sought treatment at a fertility specialist, the new doctor said "both fallopian tubes were burnt down to nubs, making natural conception impossible." <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/crime/vp-nw-obgyn-charged-20191108-nyb7x7f4mvegxbp2bpa3oj4ejm-story.html">Court documents</a> allege that Perwaiz tied her tubes without her knowledge or consent.</p>

      <p>Perwaiz allegedly told a separate patient she needed a hysterectomy because of an "imminent onset" of cancer, and despite her consenting only to a less invasive operation focused on her ovaries, she allegedly woke up to discover he performed a total hysterectomy anyway. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/virginia-doctor-allegedly-performed-hysterectomies-tied-fallopian-tubes-without-consent-n1079761">NBC News</a> reports Perwaiz was also accused of cutting her bladder during surgery, causing sepsis. Her medical records reportedly describe the surgery as "elective" and cancer is not mentioned in them.</p>

Witnesses also allege that Perwaiz didn't use regional anesthesia on patients.</p>
      <p>In the past, Perwaiz has faced eight malpractice lawsuits. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/virginia-doctor-allegedly-performed-hysterectomies-tied-fallopian-tubes-without-consent-n1079761">NBC News</a> reports they include allegations he "caused permanent injuries to three patients and life-threatening injuries to two others and failed to use techniques that were not invasive."</p>
