      <p>There is a sense of optimism around Old Trafford heading into the international break after the Red Devils comprehensively overcame Brighton on Sunday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Andreas Pereira’s deflected effort was swiftly followed by a Davy Propper own goal, with Marcus Rashford hitting a fierce drive off the underside of the bar to complete a 3-1 victory after Lewis Dunk had reduced the deficit.</p>
      <p>It was an impressive performance by United having hit three past Partizan Belgrade on Thursday, leaving manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer with a smile on his face.</p>
      <p>“Yeah, I think it’s our best performance of the season,” the Norwegian said.</p>
      <p>“Of course you can go back to Chelsea but today I thought the reaction after they scored was fantastic.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes this season we’ve asked that when you get one or two up to go for the next one… and how we didn’t end up five, six, seven (today) I don’t know, or we don’t know, the players don’t know.</p>
      <p>“But exhilarating, entertaining and great to see the boys enjoy themselves.</p>
      <p>“These six weeks or whatever it has been since the international break when we started against Liverpool, we had five wins and a defeat after the Liverpool game.</p>

      <p>“Of course the Bournemouth game was disappointing but we’ve had loads of answers to what we’re trying to do and if we don’t get confidence from this, I don’t know what to tell them.”</p>
      <p>Solskjaer lauded the ever-improving midfielder Fred and summer signing Harry Maguire after the game, as well as 19-year-old left-back Brandon Williams following an impressive display on his first Premier League start.</p>
      <p>The only real negative was the sight of influential midfielder Scott McTominay in pain after suffering an ankle injury.</p>
      <p>Having been helped off the pitch after treatment, he was taken down the tunnel on a stretcher after several minutes of attention in the technical area.</p>

      <p>McTominay was able to walk out of Old Trafford, albeit with a bit of a limp, and the severity of the issue will be assessed on Monday.</p>
      <p>“He went over on his ankle,” Solskjaer said. “It’s a painful one.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes that’s… I’ve had one and I was out for eight weeks. But then again sometimes you’re back in two weeks, so I don’t know.</p>
      <blockquote>Exhilarating, entertaining and great to see the boys enjoy themselves</blockquote>
      <p>“He’s in for a scan tomorrow… but it looked painful and he’s not one for rolling around.”</p>
      <p>Brighton came into the match looking for a fourth Premier League win in five matches but they left Old Trafford empty-handed and boss Graham Potter had no complaints about the result.</p>
      <p>“They were the better team, deserved to win,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We tried but we didn’t play as well, the level we can play at, but we have to credit the opposition as well, so a bit of both.”</p>
