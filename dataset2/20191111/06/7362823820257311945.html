      <h1>Mother’s last words to her kids before Mexican cartel slayings revealed</h1>

      <p>A Mormon teen who <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/mexico-cartel-ambush-american-father-leaving-country-wife-sons-killed">walked 14 miles</a> to get help for his siblings who were attacked by Mexican drug cartel gunmen recalled how his mother warned the family to ‘get down’ before she was <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/mormon-families-flee-mexico-arizona-cartel-massacre">fatally shot last Monday.</a></p>
      <p>‘Get down right now!’ were the last words from Dawna Langford to her eight children, two of which ended up dying, 13-year-old Devin Langford <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/american-father-speaks-1st-time-deadly-mexican-ambush/story?id=66893435">told ABC News</a> in an interviewed that aired on “World News Tonight” on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Devin told the network his mother began to pray as the cartel members, carrying long guns and wearing vests, approached the family.</p>
      <p>Once the dust settled, Dawna and two of her boys, Trevor Langford, 11, and Rogan Langford, 2, were dead.</p>
      <p>Six other children inside the family’s white Chevy Chevrolet Suburban survived.</p>
      <p>Devin ended up ushering his siblings into a hiding spot before walking 6 hours back to the family’s community of LaMora in Sonora, Mexico, where he notified relatives of the bloodshed.</p>
      <p>Devin’s dad, David Langford, expressed his heartache.</p>

      <p>“So now, it’s my whole life has turned upside down,” he told the network. “Not only have I lost a wife and two children, but I’m having to move the rest of my family with really no place to go at this point.”</p>
