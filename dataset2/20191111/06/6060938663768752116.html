      <h1>2nd T20I: Shafali Verma, Deepti Sharma power India Women to 10-wicket win over West Indies Women</h1>

      <p>GROS ISLET (St Lucia): Teenager <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Shafali-Verma">Shafali Verma</a> scored her second consecutive half century after off-spinner <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Deepti-Sharma">Deepti Sharma</a> starred with the ball as the Indian women's cricket team registered an emphatic 10-wicket win over the West Indies in the second T20 International.</p>
      <p>The 15-year-old Shafali continued her impressive run by scoring a quick-fire 69 off 35 balls alongside Smriti Mandhana (30). The duo powered India to a 2-0 lead in the five-match series on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>Shafali, who overtook the iconic Sachin Tendulkar to become the youngest Indian cricketer to score a half-century in international cricket, displayed scintillating form yet again and smashed 10 fours and two sixes.</p>

      <p>Earlier, the Indian bowlers, led by Deepti, who registered career-best figures of 4 for 10, managed to restrict the West Indies for a paltry 103 for seven in the stipulated 20 overs.</p>
      <p>Opting to bat, the West Indies openers struggled to get going. Pacer Shikha Pandey drew first blood for India when she dismissed Stacy-Ann King (7) in the fourth over.</p>
      <p>Wicketkeeper Shemaine Campbelle soon followed after Radha Yadav (1/20) had her stumped for a duck.</p>
      <p>Opener Hayley Mathews (23) and Chedean Nations (32) tried to resurrect the West Indies innings but could only manage a 32-run stand as pacer Pooja Vastrakar(1/23) dimissed the former.</p>
      <p>However, the West Indies were unable to get any kind of momentum going as wickets kept tumbling. Deepti accounted for the four wickets in the last four overs.</p>
      <p>Later Shafali and Mandhana, who had also smashed a half-century in the series-opener, played second fiddle to the teenager. The 23-year-old's innings was laced with four boundaries.</p>
      <p>West Indies captain Anisa Mohammed had no answer to the Indian duo and used seven bowlers, including herself, with no success.</p>
      <p>The combined effort saw India reach their target in 10.3 overs.</p>
      <p>The third T20I will be played at Providence Stadium in Guyana on November 14.</p>
      <p>Brief scores: West Indies 103/7 in 20 overs (Chedean Nation 32, Hayley Matthews 23; Deepti Sharma 4-10) lost to India 104/0 in 10.3 overs (Shafali Verma 69 not out, Smriti Mandhana 30 out) by 10 wickets.</p>
