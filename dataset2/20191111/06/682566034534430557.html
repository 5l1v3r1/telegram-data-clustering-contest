      <p>London - <b>Novak Djokovic</b> is bracing himself to battle <b>Roger Federer</b> and his army of fans as he seeks to equal the Swiss player's record tally of six <b>ATP Finals</b> titles.</p>
      <p>The Serbian world No 2 started his campaign on Sunday with a straightforward <b>6-2, 6-1</b> victory over Italy's<b> Matteo Berrettini</b>.</p>
      <p>Federer, seeded three in London, lost to fifth seed <b>Dominic Thiem 7-5, 7-5</b> in the evening match.</p>
      <p>But all eyes are on a mouth-watering repeat of the Wimbledon final in Group Bjorn Borg later in the week - the top two players from the four-man group qualify for the semi-finals.</p>
      <p>Djokovic, 33, saved two match points on Federer's serve to win his fifth Wimbledon crown despite overwhelming support for the Swiss from the crowd in July.</p>
      <p>Speaking after his victory at the O2 Arena on Sunday, Djokovic said he understood why Federer had such a huge following and explained his strategy to feed off the energy of the crowd.</p>
      <p>"I understand why there is so much support for Roger," said Djokovic of the 20-time Grand Slam champion.</p>
      <p>"He is who he is. And what he has achieved and the personality that he is, he deserves that.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes, you know, the crowd is on your side, the majority of the crowd is on your side, and sometimes it's against you. It's something throughout my career I had to learn how to handle, how to accept, and how to deal with that."</p>
      <p>The Serbian, who has won 16 majors and is chasing the end-of-year number one ranking, said he had twisted "Roger, Roger" chants into Novak chants in his mind at Wimbledon.</p>
      <p>"When I said that I was kind of trying to transform the chanting into 'Novak, Novak' when I heard 'Roger', that's really what I try to do," he said.</p>
      <p>"It really works mentally in these kinds of moments. It will not be anything particularly different in terms of my reaction if that happens."</p>
      <p>Djokovic said he would focus on what worked for him in order to win.</p>
      <p>"Obviously there is a lot of people and tennis fans that like to see us going head to head, and of course I understand that, and hopefully it's going to be a packed house and everyone will enjoy their tennis."</p>
