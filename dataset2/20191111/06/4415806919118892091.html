      <p>A Hong Kong protester was shot by police today in a dramatic scene caught on video as demonstrators blocked train lines and roads during the morning commute.</p>
      <p>The shooting is likely to inflame anger further in this semi-autonomous Chinese territory after a student who fell during an earlier protest succumbed to his injuries on Friday and police arrested six pro-democracy lawmakers over the weekend.</p>
      <p>The video shows a police officer shooing away a group of protesters at the intersection, then drawing his gun on a masked protester in a white hooded sweatshirt who approaches him.</p>
      <p>As the two struggle another protester in black approaches, and the officer points his gun at the second one.</p>

      <p>He then fires at the chest area of the second protester, who falls to the ground.</p>
      <p>The officer appeared to fire again as a third protester in black joined the tussle.</p>
      <p>The protester in white manages to flee, bounding up a nearby stairway, and the officer and a colleague pin the two in black to the ground.</p>
      <p>Police said that only one protester was hit and he was undergoing surgery.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for the Hong Kong hospital authority said the person shot was in critical condition but gave no further details.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong is in the sixth month of protests that began over a proposed extradition law and have expanded to include demands for greater democracy and police accountability.</p>
      <p>Activists say Hong Kongâ€™s autonomy and Western-style civil liberties, promised when the former British colony was returned to China in 1997, are eroding.</p>
