      <h1>Very Impressive: Kapil Dev joins Bollywood celebs to praise Ranveer Singh’s Natraj shot from ’83</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T06:15:02+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 06:15</time> by <a rel="author">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p>Watching him play <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kapil-Dev">Kapil Dev</a> on-screen would be nothing less than a feast for fans as <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ranveer-Singh">Ranveer Singh</a> proved it with his first movie still from '83'. Sharing a photo of himself very much in character and acing the famous 'Natraj shot' of the cricket stalwart, Ranveer left fans shocked at the spitting resemblance.</p>
      <p>Donning a curly hairdo with a moustache and team India’s white World Cup uniform, the picture goes to show director Kabir Khan’s eye for detail. “The match that was never televised... a world record innings that India never saw... this April the world will see how history was made on that cold windy day in Tunbridge Wells...” director Khan captioned the click.</p>
      <p>No sooner did the post go up on social media platforms, did it earn rave comments from fans and Bollywood celebs alike. It seems that Ranveer did enough to woo even the man himself – Kapil Dev over with the impressive click.</p>
      <p>The cricketer, on who the biopic is based, took to the comments section to laud the actor and say, “Very Impressive.”</p>
      <p>Ranveer also won appreciation from his Bollywood pals including <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ayushmann-Khurrana">Ayushmann Khurrana</a>, Dia Mirza, Rakul Preet, Neena Gupta, Atul Kasbekar among others who had nothing but words of praise.</p>

      <p>The upcoming sports film based on the former World Cup-winning captain will feature Ranveer essaying Kapil's role and needless to say, he has proved to be the perfect match ever since he first introduced "Kapil's devils" in late May. Ranveer has left no stone unturned to get into his character. He was earlier seen jotting down notes from the ace cricketer at his residence in London.</p>
      <p>In June, the star had shared a video, which showed him working out in a gym and practising on a cricket pitch in the picturesque town of Dharamshala in Himachal Pradesh. The clip also featured him training with Kapil, who was the captain during India's 1983 World Cup win.</p>
      <p>The film will also feature R Badree, Hardy Sandhu, Chirag Patil, Saqib Saleem, Pankaj Tripathi, Tahir Bhasin, Ammy Virk and Saahil Khattar as members of the cricket team.</p>
      <p>The movie that will also feature <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Deepika-Padukone">Deepika Padukone</a> as Romi Devi, is slated to release on April 10, 2020.</p>
