      <p>MOSCOW (AP) — A St. Petersburg court has rejected a defense lawyer’s request for a prominent Russian history professor who’s suspected of murdering and dismembering a female student to be released under house arrest pending trial.</p>
      <p>The court on Monday ordered Oleg Sokolov detained for two months.</p>
      <p>The case has attracted wide attention in Russian media because of its grisly aspects.</p>
