      <h3>Barcelona scouts have taken a keen interest in the U17 World Cup with several of the club’s scouts tracking the next young prospect of the football world.</h3>
      <p>Barcelona’s Ansu Fati had received clearance to play for Spain in early October but has not been included in the Under-17 World Cup squad to play him with the senior team instead.</p>
      <p>Jose Martinez and Ilaix Moriba are the only two players representing Blaugrana at the tournament, with both these Spanish players looking to impress the club’s hierarchy to push for the first team.</p>
      <p>Barca’s scouts will also be tracking other players in the tournament to find the next promising player for the club’s future. Let us look at the 8 players currently scouted by Barcelona,</p>
      <h3>Pedro González ‘Pedri’ – Spain (Las Palmas)</h3>

      <p><b>Pedri</b> is no stranger to Barca as the 16-year-old  has agreed to join the Spanish champions in July 2020. FC Barcelona<a href="https://www.fcbarcelona.cat/ca/noticies/1335629/barca-i-las-palmas-arriben-a-un-acord-per-al-traspas-de-pedri"><b> reached an agreement</b></a> with Las Palmas for the signing of the Spanish youngster on a two-year deal that will cost the Catalans 5 million euros.</p>
      <p>The Las Palmas midfielder is currently playing in Segunda Division, where he has excelled on many occasions having scored three goals and assisted two in his 10 appearances.</p>
      <p>With Barca looking to restructure for the inevitable future without Lionel Messi, the team’s future looks bright with Pedri and Fati on the attack.</p>
      <h3>Johan Mina – Ecuador (CS Emelec U20)</h3>

      <p><b>Johan Mina</b> was a key player for Ecuador at the  U-17 South American Championship, where the young midfielder helped the team reach a fourth-place finish, scoring six and assisting two in the course of the tournament.</p>
      <p><a href="http://sport-english.com/en/news/barca/barca-to-track-young-ecuador-star-johan-mina-at-u17-world-cup-7700226"><b>Report’s</b></a> claim that the 17-year-old is a crucial target for Barca, and with the player turning 18 in February 2020, the Catalans will be looking to negotiate for the youngster in the following summer transfer market.</p>
      <p>The Ecuadorian is currently under contract with Emelec, who are trying to renew the player’s contract but with no success. As a result, Mina has yet to train with the club since October, having failed to appear on their team sheets for almost a year now.</p>
      <p>Blaugrana’s Pep Boada and Ramon Planes will be tracking the youngster at the U-17 World Cup with other clubs like Chelsea also interested, according to player’s agent Klinton Tenorio.</p>
      <h3>Exequiel Zeballos – Argentina (Boca Juniors)</h3>

      <p><b>Zeballos</b> is currently playing for Boca’s reserve team where the youngster has an important role as a left-winger.  The 17-year-old will look to impress in the U17 World Cup in order to push for the first-team debut.</p>
      <h3>Matías Palacios – Argentina  (San Lorenzo)</h3>

      <p><b>Palacios</b> made his debut in the Argentine Primera División with San Lorenzo on 21 September 2018, making him the team’s youngest player ever to play in the league.</p>
      <p>The 17-year-old is representing Argentina in the U17 World Cup and is regarded as the squad’s biggest star according to coach Pablo Aimar.</p>
      <p>This has attracted many interests from European clubs, including Barcelona. According to Marca, San Lorenzo are aware of the popularity of the player and have decided to not lose the youngster at any cost.</p>
      <h3>Lucien Agoume – France (Internazionale)</h3>

      <p><b>Agoume</b> is being heavily <a href="https://www.mundodeportivo.com/futbol/fc-barcelona/20190308/46912381929/el-joven-agoume-se-aleja-del-barca.html"><b>scouted</b></a> by Barca, who previously has been linked with Barcelona B but decided to join Conte’s Inter Milan instead.</p>
      <p>The 17-year-old has been compared to fellow countryman Paul Pogba, which has drawn interests from the likes of Barcelona and Manchester United. <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/barcelona/transfer-talk/news/barcelona-eye-17-year-old-midfielder_352816.html"><b>Reports</b></a> claim that RB Leipzig and Saint-Etienne are also interested in the Frenchman, with the player eager to play first-team football at his next destination, which could rule out a move to Blaugrana.</p>
      <p>The French international could be available in the next transfer window for as little as €5m, which would be a great deal for a promising midfielder.</p>
      <h3>Gabriel Veron – Brazil (Palmeiras U17)</h3>

      <p>Deemed as ‘the next Neymar’ for Brazil, 17-year-old <b>Gabriel Veron</b> is a creative forward who possesses a powerful strike. The Brazilian is expected to make his breakthrough this year.<br/>The Brazilian was the best player at the Juvenil Club World Cup and also managed to be the top scorer of the tournament. He will look to continue this form in the U17 World Cup, which would definitely be interesting to watch out for by the scouts.</p>
      <h3>Zito Luvumbo – Angolan (Primeiro de Agosto)</h3>

      <p><b><a href="https://www.sport.es/es/noticias/barca/las-jovenes-perlas-que-barca-seguira-mundial-sub-17-7702046"><b>Sports </b></a></b>describes youngster <b>Zito Luvumbo</b> as the ‘African Jewel’ of the U17 World Cup.</p>
      <p>The Angolan has been recently linked with West Ham and Manchester United with both teams looking to track the player’s performance at the tournament.</p>
      <p>Luvumbo is a talented winger, who can also play as a poacher. The 17-year-old has already experienced two senior games for Angola before dropping back to the U17 squad in order to compete in the U17 World Cup.</p>
      <p>The youngster is currently under contract at CD Primeiro de Agosto, a top-tier team in Angolan. But with interests shown by many European clubs, including Barcelona, it is only a matter of time before we see the forward playing for a top European side.</p>
      <h3>Jun Nishikawa – Japan (Cerezo Osaka)</h3>

      <p>Japan’s <b>Jun Nishikawa</b>, has been observed by Barca since their capture of Kashima Antlers attacker Hiroki Abe. The 17-year-old is said to be one of Asia’s greatest prospects.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mundodeportivo.com/futbol/fc-barcelona/20190709/463384172741/jun-nishikawa-el-otro-japones-que-el-barca-tiene-controlado.html"><b>Mundo Deportivo</b></a> says Barcelona have to wait for any negotiations as the player is yet to turn 18. However, Barca are determined to sign the Japanese talent after hearing Spanish Coach  Miguel Ángel Lotina discuss the youngster’s potential.</p>
      <p>Which of these players would you like to see at Barcelona?</p>
