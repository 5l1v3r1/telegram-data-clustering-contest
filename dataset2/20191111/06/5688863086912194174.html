        <b>After his record-breaking display that led India to a series win over Bangladesh, Deepak Chahar has revealed that he simply focuses on delivering the best on the next ball till the end of his spell. Chahar won the Man of the Match award for his 6-fer and Man of the Series award for his consistency.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Chahar bowled a total of 10.2 overs throughout the series and conceded no more than 56 runs while picking up eight wickets in the process. In the absence of senior men like <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/bhuvneshwar_kumar">Bhuvneshwar Kumar</a>, <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/jasprit_bumrah">Jasprit Bumrah</a>, and <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/mohammad_shami">Mohammad Shami</a>, the speedster has set down a marker for all to see as the Men in Blue prepare for the T20 World Cup next year.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, he jolted the Bangladeshi top-order with two early wickets, before returning in the 13th over to remove the well-set Mohammad Mithun and trigger a collapse. Chahar then went on to remove the last three batsmen off successive deliveries to becomes the first-ever Indian to pick up a hat-trick in T20Is. With his spell of six for seven in 3.2 overs, Chahar also set the record for the best-ever bowling figures in the format.</p>
      <p>“I never thought of this, not even in my dreams. I have been trying to work hard since my childhood and my efforts have paid off. Rohit was planning to give me the crucial overs and the management wanted to do the same. I always focus on the next ball, I keep doing that until I complete my spell,” Chahar said at the post-match presentation, reported Cricbuzz.</p>
      <p>While his new-ball partner <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/khaleel">Khaleel</a> Ahmed executed his support-role quietly, it was Shivam Dube’s medium-fast deliveries that picked up three wickets to completely cripple the visitors. After conceding 23 off his first two overs, Dube had star-player <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/mushfiqur_rahim">Mushfiqur Rahim</a> removed for a first-ball duck, before delivering a fine yorker to dismiss Mohammad Naim, who had made 81 off 48 balls.</p>
      <p>“First two overs, it was not good from my side. Third over when I came to bowl, I planned not to give boundaries. Rohit bhai told me to back my strengths. I tried to bowl the heavy ball and I backed myself. There was some pressure, but there was good backing by my skipper and the support staff. They told me to back my strengths. Happy in the end,” Dube said post-match.</p>
      <p>The duo of Chahar and Dube will now be aiming to replicate their performances in the T20s against the Windies, which will commence from December 6.</p>
