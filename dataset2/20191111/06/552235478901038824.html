      <h2>Celebrations at the top of the table despite Ince's sneers in OldFirmFacts' round-up of the weekend's Premiership action</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T06:00:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Old Firm Facts</a></address>
      <p>When Olivier Ntcham scored a 95th-minute winner in the Stadio Olimpico to clinch his side’s first win against Italian opposition in Italy and secure European football beyond Christmas, there was one thought on every Celtic fan’s mind - what will former Notts County and MK Dons manager Paul Ince make of our celebrations?</p>
      <p>Fortunately they didn’t have to wait long for an answer, with the man Sir Alex Ferguson once described as a “big-time Charlie” responding to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/chris-sutton">Chris Sutton’s</a> undimmed enthusiasm on Saturday morning by asking “What are you excited about? They only got past the group stages. It wasn’t a cup final, was it? I thought they’d won the cup final the way you were going on”. He went on to say that Scottish football was “not better than the Championship, maybe even League One”. </p>
      <p>I’m not going to stand here and say that the opinion of a man whose last job in football saw him secure a 28.6% win rate as Blackpool manager before being sacked nearly six years ago should be disregarded. No, I’m going to sit here and say it.</p>
      <p>Ince, a man who speaks with all the eloquence and authority of Melania Trump trying to negotiate with a self-scan machine, doesn’t need me to contradict him. He does a perfectly good job of that himself. If, as he suggests, Celtic are playing at a League One level, surely beating Lazio in their own patch would justify the most exuberant celebrations of all time.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>In fairness, it’s understandable that an English football pundit would be confused as to what constitutes an acceptable celebration. Down south, any celebration more vigorous than polite applause is considered ‘LIMBS ALL OVER THE SHOP’.</p>
      <p>Despite the hammer blow of being condescended to by a man who in 2017 referred to ITV host Jacqui Oatley as “darling” in a debate about VAR, the Scottish Premiership was back in action on Saturday. Kilmarnock were held to a 2-2 draw at Rugby Park by Hamilton and Ross County lost 3-1 at home to Aberdeen, or ‘Abderdeen’ as Sky Sports called them.</p>
      <p>Not to be outdone, Soccer Saturday host Jeff Stelling informed us that “Scottish League One looks like this. Roath Ravers are back to the top of the pile”. These latest bloopers from the broadcaster fly in the face of their vow to “improve our SPL coverage for the Scotch viewers”.</p>
      <p>For weeks now fans have been insisting Craig Levein and Paul Heckingbottom were no longer capable of inspiring their respective teams to victory, but words were eaten on Saturday as they did just that. The fact that the inspiration came from them both being sacked is neither here nor there.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> followed their win over Porto with a 2-0 victory at the Tony Macaroni Arena. Joe Aribo made the breakthrough and celebrated by crossing himself, an act which prompted numerous Celtic fans to tweet about how angry numerous Rangers fans will be with Aribo for crossing himself and literally zero Rangers fans to care about Aribo crossing himself. Rangers manager Steven Gerrard had expressed his concerns on Friday about the artificial surface at the Tony Macaroni Arena, but as it turned out Kris Boyd actually had a decent afternoon on Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>League leaders <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a>, meanwhile, won by the same scoreline at home against Motherwell. It was a result that suited both managers, with Neil Lennon relieved that his side didn’t suffer a European hangover and Stephen Robinson conscious that a shock victory could have put him at significant risk of being offered the Hearts job.</p>
      <p>An excellent week for both Celtic and Rangers, then, but the optimism at full time on Sunday was tempered by the two cruellest words in the English language; ‘International break’. Following the Old Firm’s recent exploits on the continent, Scotland’s trip to Cyprus arrives to remind us that following Scottish teams in Europe isn’t meant to be in any way enjoyable.</p>
      <p>It was a weekend in which goals were not hard to come by, and 24 in six games is reasonable entertainment for a “Championship, maybe even League One” competition. I’d say it’s something to celebrate, but I’ll need to run it by Paul Ince first. Darling.</p>
