      <p>PHNOM PENH, Nov 11 — Cambodian opposition leader Kem Sokha met the French ambassador today after his house arrest was lifted, although he remains charged with treason and is banned from politics and leaving the country.</p>
      <p>Sokha greeted Ambassador Eva Nguyen Binh outside his home before going inside for talks.</p>
      <p>Sokha’s house arrest was lifted as the European Union considers whether to cut preferential trade terms with Cambodia after a crackdown by Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has ruled with an iron grip for more than three decades.</p>
      <p>Cambodian authorities have arrested about 50 of Sokha’s supporters and other activists this year, accusing them of plotting a coup to overthrow Hun Sen.</p>
      <p>Sokha, 66, was arrested in 2017 and his Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) was dissolved by the Supreme Court in the run-up to last year’s general election.</p>
      <p>Hun Sen’s ruling party went on to win every seat in parliament in the vote.</p>
      <p>“As an innocent person who has been jailed for two years, I continue to demand that the charges against me be dropped,” Sokha said in a Facebook post yesterday after house arrest was lifted.</p>
      <p>“I expect today’s decision to be the first step, but I, as well as many other Cambodians who have lost political freedom, still need real solutions and justice.”</p>
      <p>Sokha was accused of plotting with foreigners to oust Hun Sen — a charge he dismissed as nonsense.</p>
      <p>The Phnom Penh Municipal Court said in a statement that Kem Sokha could leave his house, but that he could not engage in political activity or leave the country.</p>
      <p>The easing of restrictions also comes a day after Sam Rainsy, 70, a co-founder of their now-banned opposition party, flew into the region from self-imposed exile saying he aimed to return home to rally Hun Sen’s opponents.</p>
      <p>Speaking in Malaysia, Rainsy welcomed Sokha’s release from house arrest, but said all charges must be dropped and the party reinstated. — Reuters</p>
