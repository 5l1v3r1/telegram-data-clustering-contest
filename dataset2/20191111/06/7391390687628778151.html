      <p>If you don't own a Christmas jumper, I have a few questions for you. One: why? Two: why? And three: why? Not only are festive designs super cosy, but they also provide you with your one and only chance to wear something truly strange to work. So whether you're a diehard fan of a certain TV series or want to show your love for Greggs' vegan sausage roll, here are the <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/primark-have-harry-potter-themed-christmas-jumpers-i-honestly-cant-believe-it-either-12427588">most ridiculous Christmas jumpers of 2019</a>.</p>
      <p>Some people are forced into wearing cringe-worthy jumpers for workplace festivities; others simply revel in the looks on people's faces when they wear a particularly outlandish knit. While there are plenty of Christmas-themed puns to get on board with, Christmas jumpers have also become about expressing cultural (and sometimes political) opinions.</p>
      <p>True <i>Star Wars </i>fanatic? How about a <i>Harry Potter </i>devotee? There's a Christmas jumper for you. This year has also seen a drove of Brexit-themed knits ranging from impartial prints to designs clearly targeting one side of the Leave-Remain divide. Even former Prime Minister Theresa May hasn't escaped the Christmas jumper treatment.</p>
      <p>With ones for all the family (including your dog), there's no like or dislike that can't be summed up with a good festive knit. Here's a few of the most "embarrassing" ones around.</p>
