      <h1>Pasay City bans public vaping, citing health risks</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T06:08:29+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 06:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Manila" target="_blank">Coconuts Manila</a></address>
      <p>The Pasay City government today announced that it is prohibiting vaping and smoking e-cigarettes in the city’s public places, including schools, hospitals, government offices, and recreational facilities.</p>
      <p>Under the new City Ordinance 6061, vape shop owners are also banned from selling e-cigarette products to minors. Vape users will be allowed to smoke in areas designated by a public or private building.</p>
      <p>If caught violating the ordinance, both vape shop owners and smokers can be given a PHP2,000 (US$40) fine or be ordered to do 12 hours of community service, which will include cleaning the area where they were caught. Second-time offenders will be slapped with PHP3,000 (US$60) fines or 18 hours of public service, while those caught for the third time will be fined PHP4,000 (US$79) or ordered to do 24 hours of public service. The village chairman will oversee the community service completion, and the Pasay City Police Station will record the violator’s conviction.</p>
      <p>Pasay City Mayor Emi Calixtano-Rubiano said <a href="https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=720791091659849">in today’s statement</a> that it was high time for the city “to impose stricter measures on these substances to protect the youth and the general public against the ill-effects of cigarette smoking and vaping.” He also cited studies from Johns Hopkins and the American Society of Clinical Oncology, which said that <a href="https://www.cancer.net/navigating-cancer-care/prevention-and-healthy-living/stopping-tobacco-use-after-cancer-diagnosis/health-risks-e-cigarettes-smokeless-tobacco-and-waterpipes">there were hazardous effects</a> from smoking e-cigarettes such as severe lung disease, shortness of breath, and fatigue.</p>

      <p>She added that while the Philippines has <a href="https://coconuts.co/manila/news/kick-habit-philippines-smoking-ban-gets-broad-support/">made progress in controlling and banning public tobacco use</a> in the last two years, “people continue to die and become sick needlessly, and the costs to society from tobacco use continue to mount.”</p>
      <p>Calixtano-Rubiano added that the World Health Organization is already compiling cases where vaping is believed to have contributed to a patient’s disease. Meanwhile, the Philippines’ health department has said that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has documented 1,299 illnesses and 26 deaths that were believed to be vaping-related.</p>
