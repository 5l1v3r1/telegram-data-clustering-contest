      <p>Muscat: 'Made in Oman' Exhibition kicked off on Monday at Sur City Walk under the auspices of Dr Rasheed bin Al Safi Al Huraibi, chairman of the Tender Board. Organised by the Public Establishment for Industrial Estates – Madayn, represented by Sur Industrial City, the two-day exhibition is featuring products and services of 40 companies and factories in addition to the participation of several government bodies.<br/><br/>Speaking at the event, Al Huraibi hailed the efforts undertaken by Madayn to promote Omani products, which eventually enhance the quality of locally manufactured products, expand the projects in the industrial cities, and provide job opportunities for the Omani cadres.<br/><br/>Eng. Abdulqadir bin Salim Al Balushi, director-general of Sur Industrial City, stated that this is the exhibition comes along the lines of the Sultanate’s 49th National Day celebrations and it features a variety of Omani products under one roof. Companies and factories based at Sur Industrial City are taking part at the exhibition to introduce the visitors to a variety of products and services, which comprise gas and petrochemicals products, fish, mineral water bottling and purification, cement, ceramic and marble products, boat industries, fiberglass, and wooden furniture in addition to other products. Several government bodies related to SMEs' support are participating in the exhibition including Al Raffd Fund and Riyada.<br/><br/>Al Balushi added that Sur Industrial City currently embraces more than 138 projects representing various sectors. “The workforce in the industrial city has reached 2,931 with an Omanisation rate touching 50% and an investment volume amounting to OMR2,035,485,543. Sur Industrial City is making significant efforts to provide all necessary elements to attract more investments and provide job opportunities for the citizens,” Al Balushi pointed out.</p>
      <p>Hamood Al Balushi, director of Omani Products Department at Madayn, commented that this exhibition comes in line with the ongoing cooperation between Madayn and commercial centres in the Sultanate to promote Omani products in various platforms. The series of Omani Products’ Exhibitions come under Madayn’s Made in Oman Campaign, which aims at emphasising on engendering national pride; encouraging consumers both individuals and organisations to choose locally manufactured products and services; underscoring the competent capabilities of the Omani products to compete locally and internationally; and emphasising the importance of buying Omani products and its direct contribution to the national economy.<br/><br/>Hamood Al Balushi added that Madayn will organise a series of Made in Oman exhibitions in November in the Sultanate, in addition to the campaign’s upcoming participation in Horeca Exhibition – one of the region’s biggest annual hospitality events, which will be held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.</p>
