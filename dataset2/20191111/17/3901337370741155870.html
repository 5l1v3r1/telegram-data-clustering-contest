      <p>While his team suffered defeat on the field, the Zambian seems to be flourishing off it.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old took to Instagram to show off what he refers to as his ‘baby ride’. </p>
      <p>The ride in question is the BMW X5 model.</p>
      <p>Mulenga also has a nifty Mini Cooper, which he can be seen posing next to on the gram.</p>
