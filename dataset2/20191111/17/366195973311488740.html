      <p>Pardison Fontaine started out behind-the-scenes, securing writing credits on <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/Cardi-B/profile/">Cardi B</a> hits and penning the majority of <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/KanyeWest/profile">Kanye West</a>'s "Violent Crimes". Now he's ready to step into the spotlight. He already took a major first step after "Backin It Up" took off earlier this year. The Cardi-assisted joint went to the top of Billboard's Mainstream R&amp;B/Hip-Hop chart. His next single, "Peach", boasted a feature from City Girls' Yung Miami, but didn't pick up too much steam. The New York rapper's new song with <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/offset/profile">Offset</a>, "Take It Down", hits hard enough to prove that Pardison is sticking around.</p>
      <p>"Take It Down" has a hypnotic, piano-prominent beat, but its strength lies in Pardison's performance. His voice, bars and flows all convene to deliver the message that he deserves to be a known name in the hip hop landscape. He also gives as many witty and quote-able one-liners as you would expect from someone on Cardi B's songwriting roster. Prime examples include "N****s look like income tax / Can't wait to get a hold of you" and "She might get Olive Garden / Pussy taste like Jamba Juice". Pardison's friend's husband, Offset, comes in sounding in top shape.</p>
      <p>Pardison Fontaine's debut album, <i>Underrated</i>, drops this Friday.</p>
