      <p>Members of the Mayo senior men's football team will play the Mayo women's volleyball team in a friendly volleyball match next weekend.</p>
      <p>The one-off game will take place next Sunday, November 17, at 5.30 p.m. at Barnacarroll Community Centre, not Balla Secondary School at 4 p.m. as originally indicated.</p>
      <p>The aim is to introduce volleyball to both boys and girls while having a bit of fun between two Mayo squads.</p>
      <p>The Mayo women's volleyball team are encouraging locals to come out and learn about the sport, meet their team and have fun watching their ladies play against the men in a different field.</p>
      <p>Said volleyball player, Mikal O'Boyle: “Volleyball is picking up quickly, so we wish to promote our sport--particularly to the younger crowd.</p>
      <p>“We have a lot of respect for James Horan and the Mayo inter-county team who have made us so proud over the years, but of course we look forward to taking them on.</p>
      <p>“We would encourage as many people as possible to come along to watch and maybe even consider getting involved in volleyball at some level.</p>
      <p>"It'll be a fun day for all and a great way to see both Mayo sportswomen and sportsmen on one court”</p>
