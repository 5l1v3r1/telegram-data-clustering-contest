      <p>Lite.IM, a Swiss based non-custodial wallet has launched crypto backed financial hub. It allows users to receive payments in cryptocurrency without providing KYC (Know Your Customer) information in Europe, thanks to the collaboration with Swiss Based <a href="https://bity.com/">Bity.com</a></p>
      <p><a href="https://www.lite.im/">Lite.IM</a> is designed to help individuals, businesses and organizations to operate on their own terms and advance the development process of decentralization. The users can access the free service and enjoy the whole array of benefits without having to pay substantial percentage of commission.</p>
      <p>Unlike PayPal that charges up to 3 percent, Lite.IM doesn’t charge at all. An invoice sent for 5000CHF will see a deposit of the exact amount in user’s account within one working / business day.</p>
      <p>Keeping the necessity of a truly decentralized environment and to diminish the division of digital on a global level, we have kept the signup process quite simple. It only takes a couple of minutes for a person or business to get started using their IBAN (International Bank Account Number). The whole process is user friendly and doesn’t incur any charges.</p>
      <p>Once verified, users then can send invoice through Telegram, Facebook messenger or SMS. With Lite.IM the easiest way to receive payment is in Bitcoin and that later can be deposited, in Euros, in the receiver’s account. Also, any transaction of up to 5000 CHF (4550 Euro) a day will require no additional documentation.</p>
      <p>Looked over by Swiss regulations, the users do not need to download any sort of application and the feature can directly be accessed through SMS, Facebook Messenger, Line and Telegram.</p>
      <p>The exquisite model of Lite.IM has attracted people to take advantage of the service and as a result since we launched we have grown our user database to over 800,000 by now. We think the feature is ideally suited to the freelancing community, SMBs (Small and Medium Businesses).</p>
