      <p>Barcelona face Atletico in the Spanish Super Cup semi-finals in Saudi Arabia, it was decided Monday.</p>
      <p>The game will take place on January 9, with the final against Real Madrid or Valencia on January 12.</p>
      <p>The competitionâ€™s new format will earn the RFEF 120 million euros over the next three years - 40m for each edition in Saudi Arabia.</p>
      <p>Madrid face Valencia a day earlier, on Jan 8, and if they and Barcelona win the second Clasico of the season could take place overseas.</p>
      <p>Barca are in the tournament as La Liga champions, while Valencia are in there because they won the Copa del Rey.</p>
      <p>Atletico qualify as second in the league and Real Madrid, as third in the top flight because Barca, the cup runners-up, are already there.</p>
