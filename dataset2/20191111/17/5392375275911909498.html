      <p>Yesterday, VIVO published another poster of the upcoming VIVO S5. It turns out with the launch of this handset, the manufacturer has taken the selfie camera beauty algorithm a step forward. At the same time, as we can see <a href="https://www.anzhuo.cn/news/p_37084">on the poster</a>, the appearance of the phone is consistent with the previous leaks. The back cover’s blue-green gradient effect brings a quite recognition rate to the phone.</p>

      <p>As for the so-called ‘5-fold super-quality beauty’, this is the new beauty concept developed by VIVO. We can see that the VIVO S5 will have a major upgrade in the self-portrait beauty function. The number ‘5’ should mean that the VIVO S5 will beautify in many aspects to achieve a more textured effect and meet the strict requirements of young people who love self-portraits.</p>

      <p>In fact, in terms of selfies, VIVO has always been in the leading position in the industry. From the first front soft light to the full scene selfie experience, to today’s ‘5-fold super-quality beauty’, VIVO has always been committed to optimizing the pre-selfie effect. The first generation of the VIVO S series, the VIVO S1 Pro, features a 32-megapixel lifting front camera with an upgraded AI beauty and light and shadow effect.</p>

      <p>As for other selling points, the VIVO S5 will come with a unique gradient effect. It is worth mentioning that the handset uses a punch-hole design to achieve a larger screen ratio. As shown above, the hole’s diameter on the upper right area is extremely small.</p>
      <p>We also believe this phone will bring more surprises. It’s set to come on November 14. So not that long is left.</p>
