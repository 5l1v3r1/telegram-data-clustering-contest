      <h2>The former Red Devils full-back pinpointed key areas where United need to strengthen although admitted he feels the club have "something to work with" among the current crop</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T17:39:28+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 17:39</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/gary-neville">Gary Neville</a> has claimed that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Man Utd</a> still need "four or five" new signings despite their recent spell of good form.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils saw off <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> 3-1 on Sunday to bump themselves up to seventh in the table.</p>
      <p>They are now on a run five wins from their last six in all competitions, with the only blemish a 1-0 loss away at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> .</p>
      <p>But even though United's new additions have all been performing well, Neville feels more transfers are imperative.</p>
      <p>He told Sky Sports: "It's been a really good month for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> , barring the Bournemouth defeat.</p>

      <p>"That game was frustrating and took us back a few steps but generally it's been a better month than the one before.</p>
      <p>"You can see some real excitement with Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial, Mason Greenwood and Daniel James, there's something to work on there.</p>
      <p>"Defensively, with Harry Maguire and Aaron Wan-Bissaka, there's something to work on there too.</p>
      <p>"The young boy Brandon Williams gives me a great deal of hope."</p>

      <p>Adding on his own podcast, Neville said: "Look, Manchester United need four or five players with real quality and experience.</p>
      <p>"They really need another centre-back, they need a left-back, and a couple of central midfielders and a striker or a forward.</p>
      <p>"That's not going to change and won't change entirely even after January. But there's something there."</p>

      <p>United have been linked with a move for their former striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, which would see him make a sensational return in January.</p>
      <p>The Swedish veteran is out of contract at MLS side LA Galaxy where he has continued to bang in goals on a regular basis.</p>
      <p>His experience would be invaluable for the club's youngsters, and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-utd-target-zlatan-ibrahimovic-20857356">reports in Italy</a> suggest that United will battle AC Milan for his signature, despite speculation he has already agreed a deal at the San Siro.</p>
      <p>United chiefs are also said to be weighing up a move for another of their former stars Wilfried Zaha.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> winger came close to leaving Selhurst Park in the summer, with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> both in talks.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-utd-weighing-up-70m-20851948">The Sun now report</a> that United will look to bring Zaha back to Old Trafford, where he had a spell from 2013-15.</p>
