      <p>Clairefontaine-en-Yvelines -<b>Â </b><b>Blaise Matuidi</b> has been ruled out of <b>France's</b> <b>Euro 2020 qualifiers</b> against Moldova and Albania after fracturing a rib cartilage, the midfielder's club Juventus announced on Monday.</p>
      <p>"Blaise Matuidi will not participate in the National Team retreat with France, after he withdrew from yesterday's match against Milan," the Italian champions said in a statement on their English language website.</p>
      <p>"The midfielder today underwent an MRI scan today, which showed a fracture of the cartilage of the tenth rib."</p>
      <p>Juventus did not state for how long the 32-year-old would be out of action.</p>
      <p>Matuidi picked up the injury in the 1-0 win over AC Milan that kept Juve top of Serie A, and failed to make the trip to Paris ahead of the two Group H clashes on Thursday and Sunday which could seal qualification for next summer's finals.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately I am out of the side, but I'm certain that the @equipefrance will qualify," Matuidi said on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Coach Didier Deschamps has picked Arsenal's uncapped Matteo Guendouzi in Matuidi's place, and is sweating on the fitness of Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Tanguy Ndombele, who suffered a groin injury in Tottenham's 1-1 Premier League draw with Sheffield United.</p>
      <p>Les Bleus' squad will meet at the historic Clairefontaine training camp with France second in their group, level on 19 points with leaders Turkey and four ahead of third-placed Iceland with two matches to play.</p>
      <p>With two teams qualifying from each group, a win against bottom side Moldova at the Stade de France this week would guarantee a spot in the finals.</p>
      <p>They will also qualify if Iceland fail to beat Turkey.</p>
