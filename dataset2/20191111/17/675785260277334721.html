      <h1>UK weather forecast: 'Danger to life' warning as heavy rain to bring more flood misery</h1>
      <h2>The Met Office has issued a series of yellow weather warnings after torrential rains deluged northern England</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T17:32:46+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 17:32</time> by <a rel="author">Talia Shadwell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/talia-shadwell/</a></address>
      <p>'Danger to life' weather warnings have been issued for much of the country with heavy rain set to bring further flood misery.</p>
      <p>The Met Office and Environment Agency issued a series of flood warnings peaking with a day of heavy downpours and flooding on Thursday.</p>
      <p>It comes after treacherous floods on Friday deluged huge swathes of the north, leaving entire communities cut off and forcing hundreds to flee their homes.</p>
      <p>Communities, including villages in the South Yorkshire town of Doncaster on the banks of the River Don, remain under 3ft of water in some parts following days of flooding.</p>
      <p>The floodwaters have already claimed one life.</p>
      <p>Annie Hall, the former high sheriff of Derbyshire, drowned when she was swept away by the River Derwent in Darley Dale on Friday.</p>

      <p>The worst of the weather is due to hit on Thursday, with Doncaster warned it is at risk of 'danger to life' flooding after an intense deluge that saw the army and RAF sent in over the weekend to aid stricken villages.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of residents were forced to evacuate as the village of Fishlake was inundated by around 3ft of water.</p>
      <p>Today's Met Office yellow warning is predicting yet more floods for parts of Northern England and the Midlands as far north as Lichfield.</p>
      <p>The warning covers already soaked Derbyshire and Stoke-on-Trent, and West Yorkshire and Staffordshire.</p>
      <p>The River Don in Yorkshire, which flows through Sheffield, Rotherham and Doncaster, hit its highest recorded level at just over 6.3 metres on Friday, leaving entire neighbourhoods under knee-high waters.</p>

      <p>The Environment Agency issued five 'danger to life' severe flood warnings for Monday.</p>
      <p>These cover the River Don at Bentley, Fishlake, Kirk Bramwith, South Bramwith and Willow Bridge Caravan Site.</p>
      <p>The Met Office says residents and businesses can expect flooding and disruptions on the roads and railways throughout the rest of the day</p>
      <p>The safety alert continues between midnight night and noon tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Wednesday is set to be relatively clear, but the foul weather is due to strike back with a vengeance on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/met-office">Met Office</a> issued a 'danger to life' warning for parts of the north on Thursday, and expanded the affected area to include Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, and South Yorkshire.</p>

      <p>Less severe yellow weather warnings cover much of England and parts of Wales on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The Met Office warns flooding of homes and businesses is likely.</p>
      <p>Periods of rain and hill snow are also expected in the south of England and northeast parts of Wales.</p>
      <p>The lesser warning covers as far west as Cardiff, Liverpool and Manchester, and stretches south and east to London, covering and the Kent and Brighton coastlines, and as far north as Newcastle.</p>
      <p>Meteorologists predict sub-zero temperatures on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday morning.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/met-office">Met Office</a> forecaster Luke Miall said earlier 'persistent rain and showers' will push into north-west England tomorrow, which could result in further flooding.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> on Wednesday is forecast to be mostly fine with lengthy sunny spells in the east.</p>
      <p>Cloud will begin to build in from the west during the morning with rain across Northern Ireland, Wales and south-west England later.</p>
      <p>Thursday will bring the heavy rain forecast to hit much of England and Wales, Mr Miall said.</p>
