      <h1>Community Chest launches second episode of three-part documentary series “Add A New Story”</h1>

      <p>Community Chest has today launched ‘Movement’, the second episode of a three-part documentary series “Add A New Story” made by entertainment platform Viddsee to encourage more public donations to Community Chest.</p>
      <p>The series is directed by Singaporean documentary filmmaker Eileen Chong, and follows Mindy Tan, a Singaporean photographer as she profiles six individuals whose lives are supported by social service agencies supported by Community Chest. Each of the three episodes — ‘Time’, ‘Movement’ and ‘Space’ — encourages the public to learn about the profiles’ stories, empathise with their challenges, and support their aspirations through Community Chest.</p>
      <p>Beyond the online documentaries, the photos captured by Mindy while making the documentaries will be used as key visuals for posters that include a QR code leading to Community Chest’s donation page. The posters – whose placement is sponsored by SMRT – can be found in commuter-heavy train stations. One-hundred percent of all donations will go towards over 80 charities and 200 critical social service programmes supported by Community Chest.</p>

      <p>“Stories have a powerful and emotional way of inspiring change. More than just providing a passive viewing experience, these documentaries give the public deeper insights into the lives of the less fortunate and encourage them to “add a new story” to the lives of those in need, simply by giving the gift of their donation.” said Community Chest Managing Director, Ms Charmaine Leung.</p>
      <p>Launched in October, the first episode reflects on what time means to a vulnerable senior and a child with special needs. It profiles the lives of an 85-year-old widow who continues to find joy through Lions Befrienders; and Chloe, a student from the Association of Persons With Special Needs (APSN) Chaoyang School, and how her mother has journeyed with her to overcome her challenges.</p>
      <p>The second episode, ‘Movement’, is centered on the question of independence. The episode profiles Rifky, a boy with autism at Rainbow Centre Yishun Park School, who rose above his challenges to become the captain of the school’s futsal team; and Wendy, who despite having polio, continues to work and be financially independent through Bizlink.</p>
      <p>The final episode, ‘Space’ will be launched on November 16, and explores the importance of having our own physical and mental space. It profiles Madam Cheong, a resident of the AWWA Senior Community Home; and Daryl, a person with bi-polar disorder who seeks to help others as a Peer Support Specialist with Club HEAL.</p>
      <p>“In working with Community Chest, we are proud to be part of a project that not only makes a difference in people’s lives, but also empowers storytellers like Eileen and Mindy to continue finding stories that need to be told,” said Derek Tan, Viddsee’s Co-founder.</p>
      <p>This documentary series marks Viddsee’s latest collaboration with Community Chest, following successful marketing campaigns it carried out for previous Community Chest short films such as ‘Gift’ and ‘Ripple’.</p>
