      <p>“I’ve heard the name since I was a child, ‘Paisley Park’, and just imagined this place. It’s special to be here,” says Beck of the experience.</p>
      <p>“Every Studio has its own life to it, its special energy, it felt very creative. I didnt have any expectations of what I wanted to happen, it was just coming in here and seeing where it took us, and it was surprising.”</p>
      <p>‘The Paisley Park Sessions’ comes ahead of Beck’s fourteenth studio LP ‘Hyperspace’, which is out on November 22.</p>
