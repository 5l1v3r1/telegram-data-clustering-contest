      <p>Around 400 depositors of fraud- hit Punjab &amp; Maharashtra Co-operative Bank (PMC) on Monday met Mumbai Police Commissioner Sanjay Barve and briefed him about problems being faced by them after the RBI put certain restrictions on the troubled lender.</p>
      <p>According to Harbans Singh, one of the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/pmc-bank">PMC Bank </a>depositors who met Barve, the meeting lasted for around two hours.</p>
      <p>"In the meeting, the commissioner assured us that the police will take every possible action to bring the culprits to book and recover the money of depositors," Singh said.</p>
      <p>The city police's Economic Offences Wing (EOW) is probing the alleged irregularities in grant of loans to certain corporate entities.</p>
      <p>The EOW has so far arrested five people, including promoters of realty group HDIL and top bank officials, in the alleged Rs 4,355-crore scam.</p>
      <p>Barve assured the depositors, which included senior citizens, that the police will forward their grievances to the RBI and the bank administrator appointed by it, Singh said.</p>
      <p>The police are doing their work and the depositors need not resort to agitation, Barve told the depositors, according to Singh.</p>

The deposit withdrawal was initially capped at Rs 1,000 and then raised in a staggered manner to Rs 50,000 per customer.</p>
