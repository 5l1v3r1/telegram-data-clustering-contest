      <p>Guillermo Amor, Barca's director of institutional relations, spoke about the Spanish Super Cup draw.</p>
      <p>"It's different to other years," he said of the new set-up. "The destination is a bit further, but that's what the Federation decided and we accept that decision.</p>
      <p>"It's true that it's after Christmas, but that's not a problem either, we have to be ready for it, do the best we can and win it, that is about mentality and thinking."</p>
      <p>He said "it would be very nice" if the final was a Clasico but "you have to have a lot of respect" for Atletico, Barca's opponents and Valencia.</p>
