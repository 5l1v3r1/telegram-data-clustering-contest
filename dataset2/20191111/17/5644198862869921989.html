      <p>MADRID: Spain's acting prime minister, Socialist leader Pedro Sanchez, faced the prospect of hard bargaining to form a government on Monday (Nov 11) after his gamble on holding Spain's second election this year resulted in no clear winner but <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/socialists-in-lead-as-far-right-vox-surges-in-spain-election-12081442">a surge for the far right</a>.</p>
      <p>A polarised electorate awarded neither right nor left-wing parties enough seats to govern with a majority although the Socialists won most seats.</p>

      <p>"Forming a government looked complicated in April, now it's an inscrutable hieroglyph," El Pais newspaper wrote.</p>
      <p>The power balance between the traditional ideological blocs changed little since the last election in April but the breakdown of votes within conservative parties shifted substantially.</p>
      <p>Sanchez's Socialist Workers' Party of Spain (PSOE) won 120 of the 350 parliamentary seats - three less than in April.</p>
      <p>The conservative People's Party, which alternated in government with the Socialists for decades after Spain emerged from General Francisco Franco's dictatorship in the 1970s, recovered from a disappointing result in April to take 88 seats, gaining 22.</p>
      <p>But the centre-right Ciudadanos slumped from 57 seats to just 10 and was replaced as the country's third-largest parliamentary group by the far-right Vox, a relative newcomer, which secured 52 seats.</p>
      <p>Joining a nationalist wave in other parts of Europe, Vox's anti-immigrant stance and particularly vehement opposition to a secessionist drive in Catalonia become the first far-right party with more than one seat since Spain returned to democracy.</p>
      <p>Far-left Unidas Podemos, which tried and failed to reach a coalition deal with Sanchez after the last election, lost seven seats to take fourth place with 35 seats.</p>
      <p>Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias said he was ready to start negotiating with Sanchez on Monday and urged the left to unite this time.</p>
      <p>With many Spaniards still remembering the Franco years, the country had long appeared immune to right-wing nationalism. But Vox leader Santiago Abascal said he would now work to build what he called "a patriotic alternative" for Spain.</p>
      <p>This was Spain's fourth election in four years. In the past decade the country has suffered from austerity and near financial collapse, and saw a PP government ousted over a corruption scandal.</p>
      <p>But this time the Catalan independence drive, which has turned violent following the jailing of separatist leaders in October, was at the forefront of voters' minds.</p>
