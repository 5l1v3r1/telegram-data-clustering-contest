      <h1>Robert Peston's girlfriend drops sex bombshell about naughty way he passed driving test</h1>
      <h2>Columnist Charlotte Edwardes claimed boyfriend Robert Peston slept with his driving instructor at the age of 18</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T17:22:24+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 17:22</time> by <a rel="author">Emmeline Saunders</a></address>
      <p>Robert Peston's journalist girlfriend has revealed the X-rated way he managed to get his driving licence: by bedding his 30-something instructor when he was just 18.</p>
      <p>Charlotte Edwardes, who writes a column for the Sunday Times, claimed her ITV political editor boyfriend slept with the much older woman as a teenager while talking about <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/boris-johnson-commits-greatest-trolling-13339290">the question Boris Johnson refused to answer</a> .</p>
      <p>"My boyfriend's naughtiest thing is that he slept with his driving instructor — a woman in her late thirties — when he was 18," she wrote in her column.</p>
      <p>"This has always made complete sense to me, because if you've ever had the misfortune to get into a car with my boyfriend, you'll know there is literally no other explanation for him passing his test."</p>

      <p>While Robert is yet to confirm or deny his girlfriend's bombshell, he did retweet Charlotte's column to his one million followers.</p>
      <p>It comes two years after the couple first got together after meeting in 2017.</p>
      <p>Charlotte hit the headlines in September this year when she went public with her allegation that the prime minister had once groped her thigh during a lunch party in 1999.</p>

      <p>Johnson, who was then editor of the Spectator, had allegedly placed his hand on Charlotte's thigh under the table - and when she complained to the female guest sitting on his other side, the woman replied: "Oh god, he did exactly the same to me."</p>
      <p>Number 10 denied Charlotte's claims, but Robert is believed to have pulled out of a scheduled interview with the prime minister in the wake of Charlotte's explosive column.</p>
