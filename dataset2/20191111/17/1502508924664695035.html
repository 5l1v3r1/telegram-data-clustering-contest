      <p>The Income Tax Department on Monday surveyed Onion traders in Maharashtra, Delhi and Madhya Pradesh following reports of alleged hoarding of the commodity amid its skyrocketing prices, officials said.</p>
      <p>They said I-T sleuths checked account books of some wholesale dealers against physical stocks of the commodity and its delivery to buyers as part of a tax evasion probe.</p>
      <p>The department is examining the onion stocks as its prices have shot up to about Rs 100 a kg in various markets and there are reports of hoarding, they said.</p>
      <p>Only business premises of stockists in Maharashtra, Delhi and Madhya Pradesh were surveyed, they said.</p>
      <p>Some digital evidence and incriminating documents have been found and are being analysed, they added.</p>
