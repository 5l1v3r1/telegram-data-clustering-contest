      <p>MAYO County Council and the GAA are continuing to work together on plans for a facility at Lough Lannagh in Castlebar.</p>
      <p>Council officials were questioned at a meeting this afternoon (Monday) on whether or not the ongoing controversy surrounding Mayo GAA will impact on the multi-million euro centre of excellence project.</p>
      <p>Chief executive Peter Hynes said as of right now the council is still working with the GAA. It was not clear it would have any negative impact on it.</p>
      <p>He was responding to a query from Ballina-based Councillor Mark Duffy who said the saga was in the media every day.</p>
      <p>The ambitious project, which is a collaborative partnership between Mayo County Council with Mayo GAA, will see a 27-acre site developed at Lough Lannagh for sport, tourism and recreation.</p>
