      <p>White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham on Monday reacted to former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2019/11/10/nikki-haley-tillerson-kelly-tried-to-recruit-me-to-save-the-country-by-undermining-trump/">saying</a> former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and former White House chief of staff John Kelly recruited her to resist President Donald Trump in attempt to undermine him.</p>
      <p>Grisham said on “Fox &amp; Friends” that any attempt to undermine the president “is dangerous” and goes “against the Constitution,” adding there are members of Congress doing the same thing at this time.</p>
      <p>“I would say one thing that [Haley] just said in that clip which is undermining a president is dangerous and it does go against the Constitution and it does go against the American people, which is something that’s happening in Congress right now,” Grisham stated. “So, I think that’s an interesting tie-in, but I wouldn’t know about that conversation that she’s purporting to have in the book.”</p>
