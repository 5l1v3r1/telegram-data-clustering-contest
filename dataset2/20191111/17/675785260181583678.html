      <h1>BREAKING Neil Warnock leaves Cardiff City by mutual agreement following poor run of form</h1>
      <h2>Warnock has left the Cardiff City Stadium following a dismal run of results, which included a defeat to Bristol City this weekend</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T17:11:11+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 17:11</time> by <a rel="author">Aaron Flanagan, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/aaron-flanagan/</a></address>
      <p>Neil Warnock has left his position as manager of Cardiff City.</p>
      <p>It had been reported that Warnock spoke to club chief executive Mehmet Dalman following the 1-0 loss to Bristol City at the weekend.</p>
      <p>On Monday, Dalman said: “On behalf of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/cardiff-city-fc">Cardiff</a> City Football Club, I thank Neil for his invaluable contribution to the future of this great Club.</p>
      <p>“He not only gained promotion in his first season but played a pivotal role in uniting the fans and the club. I am personally upset by his departure and wish him the very best for the future.”</p>
      <p>Warnock added: “Today I am leaving my beloved Bluebirds after over three years of which have been some of the best days in my long football career.</p>
      <p>“I would like to thank Vincent Tan and Ken Choo for their support; Victoria my secretary who has had to look after me over the years; Kevin Blackwell and Ronnie Jepson, my ever-faithful sidekicks and friends; and all the backroom staff on both the coaching and the medical sides who have worked tirelessly to help us achieve the success we have had.</p>
      <p>“A special mention also to all of my players, past and present, who have given me everything. Thank you, you’re a great bunch.</p>
      <p>“I would especially like to thank Mehmet Dalman whom I have said many times has been one of the best Chairman I have had the privilege to work for.</p>
      <p>“His support has been immense, especially in 2019 which for many reasons both on and off the field has been the most challenging period both emotionally and physically that I have ever encountered.</p>
      <p>“It is a shared belief that this is the right time for a new voice as we believe this squad of players is more than capable of getting success.</p>
      <p>“Finally, I would like to thank all you supporters for getting behind me and the team. I hope you have all enjoyed the journey.</p>
      <p>“I am proud to leave the club as a united one and long may you all achieve the success that you deserve. Be lucky.”</p>
