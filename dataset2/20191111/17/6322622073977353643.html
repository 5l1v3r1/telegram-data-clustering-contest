      <p>NEW YORK (Nov 11): Wall Street's main indexes fell on Monday, as prospects of a quick resolution to the U.S.-China trade war dimmed following comments from President Donald Trump, while escalating violence in Hong Kong added to the downbeat sentiment.</p>
      <p>Hopes of a "phase one" trade deal and largely upbeat corporate earnings sparked a rally that helped the three major stock indexes close at record highs on Friday.</p>
      <p>Trump said on Saturday that the United States would only make a deal if it was the "right deal" for America, adding that the talks had moved more slowly than he would have liked.</p>
      <p>Ten of the 11 major S&amp;P 500 sectors were lower, with the energy sector the biggest decliner.</p>
      <p>Healthcare shares fell 0.53% and weighed the most on the benchmark index, while the communication services sector and consumer discretionary were among the biggest drags.</p>
      <p>Trade-sensitive technology shares and industrials were also lower.</p>
      <p>Continuing violence in Hong Kong hit sentiment after police shot and wounded a protester in the 24th straight week of pro-democracy unrest in the Chinese-ruled territory.</p>
      <p>"The protests in Hong Kong seem to be increasing the worries of a trade deal, but I think its just an excuse to take some money off the table," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.</p>
      <p>"We have been quite strong at those market highs last week, so it's just a minor pull back, and I don't think it's going to be enduring."</p>
      <p>The third-quarter earnings season, which is drawing to a close has been better-than-expected for the most part, with nearly three quarters of the 446 S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported results so far topping profit estimates, according to Refinitiv data.</p>
      <p>Attention now shifts to economic data and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's testimony later this week, while a handful of big companies including Walmart Inc, Cisco Systems Inc and Nvidia Corp will also report earnings.</p>
      <p>At 11:34 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 120.91 points or 0.44% at 27,560.33; the S&amp;P 500 was down 11.16 points or 0.36% at 3,081.92. The Nasdaq Composite was down 24.96 points or 0.29% at 8,450.35.</p>
      <p>Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc jumped 5.6%, after Bloomberg reported KKR &amp; Co had formally approached the drugstore giant for what could be the biggest-ever leveraged buyout.</p>
      <p>Among other stocks, Qualcomm Inc fell 2.2% after Morgan Stanley downgraded the chipmaker to "equal-weight" from "overweight".</p>
      <p>Shares of Cisco dropped 1.1% as Piper Jaffray downgraded the network gear maker to "neutral" from "overweight".</p>
      <p>Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.65-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.62-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.</p>
      <p>The S&amp;P index recorded 14 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 41 new highs and 59 new lows.</p>
      <p>The Treasury market was closed on Monday for the Veterans Day holiday.</p>
