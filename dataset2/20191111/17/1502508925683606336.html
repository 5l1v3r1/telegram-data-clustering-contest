      <h1>On customer demand, Mondelez to make smaller, less sweet, healthier snacks</h1>

      <p>Snack maker <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/mondelez">Mondelez </a>will offer more treats in smaller portions and with less sugar, as the company behind Oreo cookies and <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/cadbury">Cadbury </a>chocolate responds to consumer demands for healthier products, underlined by a survey released on Monday.</p>
      <p>The online survey of 6,068 adults in 12 countries by the Harris Poll for <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/mondelez">Mondelez </a>showed that 80% of consumers were looking for healthy, balanced snacks, although the same percentage was also still keen on indulgence.</p>
      <p>"We know consumers want options which is why we offer a range of products that taste great from wholesome to indulgent," Chris McGrath, vice president and chief of global impact, sustainability and wellbeing, told Reuters.</p>
      <p>"Consumers appreciate choice and the majority agree there is a time and a place for healthier snacks and a time and a place for indulgent ones," she said. "There is room for both and we see that as a growth opportunity for us."</p>
      <p>In July, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/mondelez">Mondelez </a>launched a version of its popular <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/cadbury">Cadbury </a>Dairy Milk with 30% less sugar in Britain, which McGrath said was selling well and was being extended into India.</p>
      <p>Mondelez lifted its 2019 sales forecast last month after reporting a 1.1% rise in third-quarter revenue, driven by higher demand in emerging markets where it has been investing heavily.</p>
      <p>It sells a thin version of its Oreo cookies with a third less sugar and a thinner, crispier version of Ritz crackers, which it markets as a healthier option to potato chips.</p>
      <p>The Mondelez survey showed that 6 in 10 people prefer to eat many small meals rather than a few large ones, with the trend towards snacking even stronger among younger consumers.</p>
      <p>"We know consumers are on the go more and more and snacking delivers on the convenience they seek," McGrath said.</p>
      <p>Mondelez has pledged to put 20% of its products in portion-controlled packs of 200 calories or less by 2025, from more than 15% now, and has also been encouraging customers to snack in a more "mindful" way, savouring each mouthful.</p>
      <p>To that end, it has given advice to nutritionists and health care professionals on promoting "mindful eating", such as putting a portion in a bowl, not eating while also looking at a screen, and eating with your non-dominant hand.</p>
