      <p>Meghan Markle has a multitude of designers and brands she wears often. From affordable pieces like her<a href="http://www.meghansmirror.com/social-media-style/meghan-opens-up-to-the-daily-telegraph/"> J.Crew cardigan</a> to more high-end items like bespoke Dior, the Duchess of Sussex knows what she likes and wears it. <a href="https://people.com/royals/see-every-photo-of-meghan-markle-and-kate-middleton-from-their-joint-remembrance-day-appearances/">Meghan Markle's Remembrance Day coat</a> was yet another designer repeat. However, the piece may just be a bit more special given that it's from the designer responsible for her wedding reception gown.</p>
      <p>According to <i>Women's Wear Daily</i>, Markle, alongside sister-in-law Kate Middleton as well as the Queen, attended a ceremony to honor fallen solider from World War I, World War II, and other subsequent combats. The event was somber with the Duchess of Sussex donning an <a href="https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/british-duchesses-don-black-for-weekend-of-remembrance-sunday-events-1203367030/">all black ensemble</a> accented only with the traditional red <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/what-does-the-remembrance-red-poppy-mean-harry-meghan-both-wore-the-pin-that-has-a-long-history-13046066">Remembrance Poppy</a>. While the occasion was solemn, Markle stepped out wearing a piece that fans of her style may consider a bit nostalgic.</p>
      <p>The Duchess chose a black <a href="http://www.meghansmirror.com/royal-style/meghan-and-harry-at-remembrance-day-2019/">Stella McCartney coat</a> that featured a silver, D-shaped buckle at her natural waist. Alongside the coat, she wore a wool, wide-brimmed hat from Stephen Jones, black leather gloves, and what appears to be a lace detail dress beneath the coat.</p>
      <p>Of course, the occasion was not one where Markle would go bold, but the inclusion of a Stella McCartney design is special given that McCartney designed the Duchess's now famous wedding reception dress.</p>

      <p>Markle's Remembrance Day coat is not, however, the first time she's revisited McCartney since her marriage. During a royal trip to Australia in Oct. 2018, Markle rewore the same <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/every-outfit-meghan-markle-wore-in-2018-15573258">Stella McCartney cape dress</a> she'd donned for the Queen's birthday earlier that year. During the same trip, she wore a creation from the designer crafted specifically for her, and this summer, at the opening of <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/meghan-markles-flats-for-the-london-series-baseball-game-are-a-new-take-on-old-favorite-18161256">Major League Baseball's London Series</a>, she chose yet another black ensemble from McCartney.</p>
      <p>Clearly, Markle's McCartney collection is quite impressive, and the label ranks among some of her favorites.</p>

      <p>Her outfit repeats with McCartney have been notable, but her <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/what-does-meghan-markles-second-wedding-dress-look-like-its-very-reflective-of-her-sleek-classic-style-9137740">wedding reception dress</a> is certainly the most memorable moment when the Duchess wore the designer. The white, halter-style gown with an open back and minimalist design has gone on to become a popular recreation for weddings. In fact, McCartney's label sells a similar style that's available at<a href="https://shop.nordstrom.com/s/stella-mccartney-f18-magnolia-halter-wedding-dress/5112595/full"> Nordstrom.</a></p>
      <p>Plus, the dress appears to have been such a hit that celebrities are using it as inspiration for their own wedding looks. In September, <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/fashion/celebrity/a29320129/hailey-biebers-wedding-dress-meghan-markles-second-dress/">Hailey Baldwin</a> (now Bieber) wore a look-a-like frock to her own wedding reception in South Carolina.</p>

      <p>Yes, Markle's Stella McCartney coat from Remembrance Day is a more reserved look, but the Duchess's decision to wear the label certainly brings back memories of that romantic day in May 2018.</p>
