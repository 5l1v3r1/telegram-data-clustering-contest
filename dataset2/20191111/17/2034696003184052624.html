        <b>Aisling Tucker Moore-Reed was previously charged with manslaughter.</b>
      </p>
      <p>An actress has been charged with murder a day after wrapping filming on a <a href="https://www.nme.com/tag/horror">horror</a> movie, in which she plays a killer.</p>
      <p>Aisling Tucker Moore-Reed had been charged with manslaughter after fatally shooting her uncle in 2016, and was out on bail when she was cast in the role for horror movie <i>From the Dark</i>, auditioning under a pseudonym.</p>
      <p>Producers have claimed they were unaware of this when they cast her for the role, which began filming in 2018 for five months.</p>
      <p>In <i>From the Dark</i>, Moore-Reed plays a woman who is said to shoot somebody in a similar fashion to the real-life shooting.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Moore-Reed’s charge was changed to murder a day after filming wrapped after police got hold of mobile phone footage which allegedly showed the real-life shooting. She has pleaded not guilty to these charges, with the trial set for later this year.</p>
      <p>“That’s part of the accusations… that really is part of the nightmare… is that we knowingly cast this person to take advantage of the situation. And I can say, none of us wanted this,” filmmaker Matthew Spickard told <i><a href="https://kobi5.com/news/murder-suspect-stars-in-local-indie-film-114362/">KOBI</a></i>.</p>
      <p>“You could feel that she is in a really dangerous position and she just handled it exactly how we wanted,” added fellow filmmaker Justin Adams.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the film company has told <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/11/05/an-actress-shot-an-attacker-horror-flick-then-crew-discovered-shes-suspect-her-uncles-real-life-killing/"><i>The Washington Post</i></a>: “Due to the movie being so low budget, and it being our first venture, we did not do background checks.</p>
      <p>“If we ever do a movie again in the future, any one of us … we now know that a background check will save us. Lesson learned, no matter how little money we have, this will save the headache.”</p>
