        <b>Google Stadia’s launch lineup has been revealed and, well, Stadia is only launching with twelve games. </b>
      </p>
      <p>After months of hype surrounding Google’s upcoming video game streaming service, the product’s closely-arriving launch seems rather flaccid.</p>
      <p>Launching on November 19th, Stadia users will only have access to the following titles:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</li>
        <li>Destiny 2: The Collection</li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/google-stadias-big-exclusive-gylt-may-not-actually-be-exclusive/">GYLT</a>
        </li>
        <li>Just Dance 2020</li>
        <li>Kind</li>
        <li>Mortal Kombat 11</li>
        <li>Red Dead Redemption 2</li>
        <li>Thumper</li>
        <li>Tomb Raider</li>
        <li>Rise of theTomb Raider</li>
        <li>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</li>
        <li>Samurai Shodown</li>
      </ul>
      <p>With most of these titles already available on numerous physical consoles – Just Dance is available on the ruddy Wii – the lineup undeniably falls flat. Thoughts of the infamous Nintendo Wii U come to mind, a system that mostly launched with re-releases. However, that launched with more games.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.blog.google/products/stadia/lineup-games-coming-to-stadia/">Google has also stated</a> that only 14 additional games will be available on the service by the end of 2019. Those games are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Attack on Titan 2: Final Battle</li>
        <li>Borderlands 3</li>
        <li>Darksiders Genesis</li>
        <li>Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2</li>
        <li>Farming Simulator 19</li>
        <li>Final Fantasy 15</li>
        <li>Football Manager 2020</li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/review-ghost-recon-breakpoint-makes-parody-embarrased/">Ghost Recon Breakpoint (lol) </a>
        </li>
        <li>Grid</li>
        <li>Metro Exodus</li>
        <li>NBA 2K20</li>
        <li>Rage 2</li>
        <li>Trials Rising</li>
        <li>Wolfenstein: Youngblood</li>
      </ul>
      <p>“We’re launching Stadia with 12 carefully-chosen games on day one, and an additional 14 will  be available by the end of the year,” Google states. “There’s something for everyone here: a library of superb, critically-acclaimed titles spanning multiple genres and age ratings.”</p>
