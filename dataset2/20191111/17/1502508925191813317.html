      <p>A sessions court here on Monday rejected the pre-arrest bail pleas filed by two directors of the scam-hit Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative Bank (PMC).</p>
      <p>Additional Sessions Judge S T Soor turned down the applications of Parmeet Sodhi and Surjit Singh Narang after noting that their custodial interrogation was required.</p>
      <p>Narang and Sodhi had claimed that they were not aware of the loans given by the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/pmc-bank">PMC bank </a>to the HDIL Group.</p>
      <p>Opposing their pleas, the Mumbai Police's Economic Offences Wing (EOW) had said that prima facie a nexus between some of the accused and HDIL group companies has been made out by the agency.</p>
      <p>It said the deep-rooted conspiracy caused loss of public funds.</p>
      <p>The agency said that six people have lost their lives due to loss of money and the public is protesting over the irregularities.</p>
      <p>The police has so far arrested five persons, including promoters of the realty group HDIL and top bank officials, in the case.</p>
