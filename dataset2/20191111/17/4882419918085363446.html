      <p>Barcelona have decided to present their appeal against Lionel Messi's yellow card to the competition committee, per Cadena SER radio.</p>
      <p>The Argentine was booked against Celta Vigo after giving away a free kick for supposedly fouling Pape Cheikh. Referee Guillermo Cuadra Fernandez saw it as an offence and issued Messi a yellow card.</p>
      <p>However the forward won the ball with the tackle. It cost Barca as Celta equalised from the free-kick at 1-1, but Messi scored two more of his own and Busquets nabbed the fourth in a 4-1 win at Camp Nou.</p>
      <p>It was Messi's first yellow of the season. Although no suspension is at stake Barca think it is unjust and will appeal.</p>
