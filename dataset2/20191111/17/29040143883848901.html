      <p><b>Best Answer:</b> Yes, you can watch Disney+ on an Apple TV so long as it's 4th Gen or newer, meaning if you bought it in the last three years, you're probably fine.</p>
      <p>Always Disney, anywhere: <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=http%3A%2F%2Fdisneyplus.bn5x.net%2Fc%2F159229%2F707638%2F9358&amp;token=_WqctGxL">Disney+</a> ($7/month at Disney+)</p>
      <h4>Does it matter which generation Apple TV?</h4>
      <p>Yes, in order for the Disney+ app to run on your Apple TV, you'll need to have a 4th Gen device (released in 2015) or newer. Then as long as it is running tvOS, you'll be able to get the Disney+ app and stream all of the Disney+ content, which includes original Disney classics, Marvel, Star Wars, and Disney+ exclusives.</p>
      <h4>So I can also watch Disney+ on my iPhone, iPad, or Mac?</h4>
      <p>That's correct. Disney+ is available on all Apple devices, including iPhones (iOS) and iPads (iPadOS). You are also able to watch it on your Mac since it is accessible through desktop web browsers.</p>
      <h4>What if I don't have an Apple device to watch on?</h4>
      <p>That's not a problem at all. Disney+ is available on a variety of hardware, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Android phones and tablets</li>
        <li>Android TV devices</li>
        <li>Amazon Fire TV devices</li>
        <li>Google Chromecast</li>
        <li>Desktop web browsers</li>
        <li>Xbox One</li>
        <li>Playstation 4</li>
        <li>Android-based Sony TVs</li>
        <li>Samsung smart TVs</li>
        <li>LG smart TVs</li>
        <li>Roku and Roku TV</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Disney+ is also slated to come to Nintendo Switch at some point, but no exact timeline has been given for it yet.</p>
      <h4>What is Disney+?</h4>
      <p>Disney+ is the streaming service where you're exclusively most Disney family-friendly content going forward, with access to hundreds of films and thousands of TV episodes from Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar, Fox, and National Geographic, and of course Disney.</p>

      <h4>How much does Disney+ cost?</h4>
      <p>Disney+ starts at a mere $6.99 a month, or $69.99 annually. There is also a bundle deal available, where you can get Disney+, ESPN, and Hulu (with ads) for just $12.99 a month.</p>
