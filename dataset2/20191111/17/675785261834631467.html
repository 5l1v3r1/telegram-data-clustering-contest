      <h2>Mandela was jailed in 1964 in South Africa. When he was released in 1990, he went on to become the country's first democratically elected president</h2>

      <p>For almost 30 years, political activist Nelson Mandela was imprisoned in South Africa.</p>
      <p>Locked up in appalling conditions, most notably Robben Island, Mandela had been jailed for life in 1964.</p>
      <p>He was accused of plotting to otherthrow the white South African government.</p>
      <p>For 18 years he was jailed in the notorious Robben Island prison in a damp, tiny concrete cell.</p>
      <p>Just eight feet by seven feet, Mandela was forced to sleep on a straw mat and spent his gruelling days breaking rocks into gravel or working in a lime quarry.</p>

      <p>Banned from wearing sunglasses, his eyesight was permanently damaged by the glare from the rock.</p>
      <p>White prison guards verbally and physically attacked him.</p>
      <p>But despite this, every evening he worked towards earning his degree from the University of London.</p>
      <p>Newspapers were banned and when he was caught with some clippings, Mandela spent long periods locked in solitary confinement.</p>
      <p>He was allowed just one visitor and one letter every six months.</p>

      <p>In the outside world, Mandela had been far from forgotten.</p>
      <p>As President of the African National Congress his supporters and his wife, Winnie, refused to give up his cause.</p>
      <p>As violence gripped South Africa, with the police turning on black men and women - shooting, stabbing and burning them - Winnie was also subjected to intolerable abuse for decades.</p>
      <p>Under house arrest, targeted and constantly in fear of violence, she never gave up fighting for her husband's cause.</p>
      <p>In jail, Mandela was as influential to the other political prisoners as he had been on the outside.</p>

      <p>Photographer, Greg English, who captured the iconic image of Mandela on the day he was freed, said: "We would do interviews with young guys coming out of Robben Island who had met Mandela.</p>
      <p>"They wanted to use violence against the guards and they would get a message to come and see Nelson Mandela and he would tell them 'that's not the way to deal with it'."</p>
      <p>In 1982 Mandela was moved from Robben Island to Pollsmoor Prison, where he remained for the next six years.</p>
      <p>While his 70th birthday was marked by a concert at Embley Stadium in 1988, Mandela was still behind bars and now battling tuberculosis, which was made worse because of the damp conditions in his cell.</p>
      <p>He was moved to Victor Verster Prison and for the first time had a relatively comfortable cell so he could recover.</p>

      <p>In 1989 FW de Klerk replaced the leader of the National Party and called a cabinet meeting to debate legalising the ANC and freeing Mandela.</p>
      <p>De Klerk met Mandela in prison  on on February 11, 1990, he was a free man for the first time in almost three decades.</p>
      <p>Iconic images of him holding his wife Winnie's hand, fist raised, were beamed around the world.</p>
      <p>But for Mandela, his work was just beginning.</p>
      <p>For the next four years he worked tirelessly with de Klerk to end apartheid and in 1994, aged 76, Mandela was able to vote for the first time in his life.</p>
      <p>He was elected the first President of South Africa, a position he held until 1999.</p>
      <p>Following his death in 2013, Mandela has been called the 'father of the nation' and his legacy lives on with the ongoing work towards equality in South Africa.</p>
