      <p>HEBRON, Palestinian Territories: Clashes erupted between Palestinians and Israeli forces Monday during demonstrations marking the 15th anniversary of Yasser Arafat’s death in the occupied West Bank, leaving a Palestinian shot dead, medics and Palestinian officials said.<br/>Demonstrations were held in Ramallah and the Hebron area in the West Bank to commemorate the legacy of Arafat, revered as a hero by Palestinians.<br/>Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas, who succeeded Arafat, laid a wreath at his tomb at a ceremony in Ramallah, where hundreds gathered with pictures and flags for the anniversary.<br/>“Israel says the martyrs are criminals, terrorists and murderers,” Abbas said.<br/>“We will never agree to give up on our martyrs, our most sacred martyrs.”<br/>Sporadic clashes erupted with Israeli forces, including in the Hebron area, where a Palestinian man was shot dead, the Palestinian health ministry and medics said.<br/>Palestinian medical sources identified the man as 22-year-old Omar Al-Badawi, who was hit in the chest with live fire at Al Arroub refugee camp before being taken to Ahali hospital in Hebron, where he was pronounced dead.<br/>An Israeli military spokeswoman said a large number of Palestinians threw stones and firebombs at soldiers, who responded with “riot-dispersal means and live fire.”<br/>Medics also reported Israeli use of live fire in clashes at Fawwar, south of Hebron, one of the most tense cities in the West Bank.<br/>Palestinians threw stones at Israeli soldiers in Hebron itself and troops responded with tear gas, an AFP journalist reported.<br/>The Palestinian Red Crescent reported at least 49 injuries in total, including two from live fire.<br/>Palestine Liberation Organization secretary general Saeb Erekat called on the International Criminal Court to investigate the shooting of Al-Badawi.<br/>Arafat died on November 11, 2004, at a hospital near Paris from unknown causes at the age of 75.<br/>Palestinians have long accused Israel of poisoning him, charges the Israeli government firmly denies.<br/>His body was exhumed in 2012 for tests, but a subsequent French investigation found no proof of poisoning.<br/>Hamas, the Islamist leaders of the Gaza Strip, prohibited a Fatah movement event to mark the death of Arafat in the coastal Palestinian enclave.<br/>Hamas and Fatah, which Arafat led, have been deeply divided since a 2007 near civil war when Hamas overthrew Abbas’s forces in the blockaded Gaza Strip.<br/>No Palestinian elections apart from local polls have been held since 2006 because of the split, but both sides have spoken of a renewed push to do so.<br/>Abbas, 84, spoke again of holding elections on Monday, saying legislative polls should be held first, followed by a presidential vote.<br/>He has insisted on holding the elections in the West Bank, in the Gaza Strip and in Jerusalem.<br/>Israel occupied the West Bank and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Six-Day War.<br/>It later annexed east Jerusalem and considers the entire city its capital, while the Palestinians view the eastern sector as the capital of their future state.<br/>Israel prevents any Palestinian Authority activity in east Jerusalem.<br/>Hamas leader Ismail Haniya on Sunday also spoke of elections, saying they were “at the very foundation of the Palestinian national project.”<br/>In 2005, Abbas comfortably won presidential elections held in both the West Bank and Gaza.<br/>But a year later, Hamas shocked the world by beating Abbas’s Fatah movement in parliamentary polls.<br/>Unlike Fatah, the Islamists reject all negotiations with Israel and support violent means. They have fought three wars with Israel since 2008.</p>
