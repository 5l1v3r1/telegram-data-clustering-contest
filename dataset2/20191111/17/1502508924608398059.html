      <h1>IOC sees diesel demand rising in 6 months as longer-than-usual monsoon ends</h1>
      <h2>India's fuel demand fell to its lowest in more than two years in September, with consumption of diesel at its weakest since January 2017</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T17:04:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 17:04</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>India's diesel demand is expected to recover in the next six months as a longer-than-usual monsoon season that affected transportation and industry has ended, the chairman of top domestic refiner <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/indian-oil-corp">Indian Oil Corp </a>(IOC) said on Monday.</p>
      <p>Diesel consumption usually tapers in monsoon season as rains hit construction and mobility. Any longer-term slowdown in fast-growing India's fuel use could dim prospects for global oil demand.</p>
      <p>"Fuel demand, especially diesel, is falling ... In (July-September) normally demand is low because of monsoons, excess rain and floods," Indian Oil's Sanjiv Singh said.</p>
      <p>India's fuel demand fell to its lowest in more than two years in September, with consumption of diesel at its weakest since January 2017.</p>
      <p>"It is a temporary slowdown," said Singh, who was in Abu Dhabi to attend an energy conference.</p>
      <p>State-owned refiners, such as IOC, Bharat Petroleum Corp and Hindustan Petroleum Corp, traditionally buy fuel from private <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/companies">companies </a>to meet demand at the pump.</p>
      <p>But falling local demand for diesel, which accounts for about two-fifths of overall fuel consumption, is prompting state refiners to export the product.</p>
      <p>Singh said that in the current fiscal year to March, IOC's diesel exports could be more than before because of the slowdown in consumption. He did not elaborate.</p>
      <p>Bharat Petroleum will export about 200,000 tonnes of diesel every month between November and March, its head of finance N. Vijayagopal said last week.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ioc">IOC </a>accounts for about a third of India's refining capacity of 5 million barrels per day.</p>
      <p>Singh also said his company was looking at buying Russian oil.</p>
