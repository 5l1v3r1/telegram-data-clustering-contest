      <h1>Supreme Court weighs DACA, thousands of immigrants' futures hang in the balance</h1>

      <p>The future of about 660,000 immigrants is in the hands of the Supreme Court.<br/><br/>The nine justices will hear oral arguments Tuesday on whether the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, better known as DACA, will stay in place.<br/><br/>Some immigration attorneys are resigned to seeing it disappear.<br/><br/>"It was a presidential action when it got implemented. It could easily be killed by a presidential action. That's the power of the president," said immigration attorney Joshua Longoria.<br/><br/>President Obama created the policy with an executive branch memorandum in 2012.<br/><br/>It gives some protection to immigrants who came to the U.S. when they were children.<br/><br/>Research has shown it helped the so-called Dreamers get jobs and better pay.<br/><br/>It's also improved the mental health status of DACA recipients like Leticia Arevalo, who grew up in Firebaugh and went to Fresno State while still undocumented.<br/><br/>"When I was undocumented, I was extremely depressed after graduating from college because I couldn't use my education," she said.<br/><br/>She's now in law school and on a path to citizenship, and just in time.<br/><br/>President Trump announced plans to phase out DACA shortly after taking over the White House.<br/><br/>The case has been stuck in court ever since.<br/><br/>The people challenging it say a federal agency can change its position, but the law requires they give an analysis and an explanation.<br/><br/>They say the Trump administration's only argument is that DACA was always illegal, which lower courts have agreed it was not.<br/><br/>But immigration attorneys compare the current fight to the one over a travel ban, so it's probably just delaying the outcome President Trump wants.<br/><br/>"A lot of those Dreamers were in the shadows. They were very scared. They were very illegal. So it's going to be a big shock," said Longoria.<br/><br/>The Supreme Court's decision could come any time between January and June, but oral arguments Tuesday could give a hint as to what the justices will decide.</p>
