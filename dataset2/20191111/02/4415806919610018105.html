      <p>More than a third of Britons believe humans will inevitably have to live in space due to the Earth becoming increasingly uninhabitable.</p>
      <p>While the public sector dominated space exploration in the 20th century, the space race this century has been revolutionised by the private sector.</p>
      <p>And it seems increasingly likely that people will look to private enterprises like SpaceX, Virgin Galactic and Asgardia to facilitate their space travel.</p>
      <p>To find out what the UK thinks about travelling to and living in space, Asgardia – the first space nation – commissioned Populus to conduct a poll of 2,103 people.</p>
      <p>From this figure, 37% said it was inevitable that humans would have to move off Earth because the planet will not be suitable to live on.</p>
      <p>A total of 29% of those surveyed said they would pay to go to space if it were easily accessible to the general public.</p>
      <p>Less than a fifth (18%) would use their savings to visit space if given the chance.</p>
      <p>People were also asked their opinions on aliens, with 42% believing extraterrestrial life has or will visit the Earth.</p>
      <p>One fifth of those polled were worried about an asteroid potentially crashing into Earth, and the same number believe planetary alignments affect their mood.</p>
      <p>A quarter of the recipients said the UK needs a stronger asteroid defence system.</p>
      <p>Asgardia, the first space nation, is named after the City of the Gods in Norse mythology.</p>
      <p>Its main aim is to develop space technology unfettered by earthly politics and laws, leading ultimately to a permanent orbiting home where its citizens can live and work.</p>
      <p>Former Liberal Democrat MP Lembit Opik, chairman of Parliament for Asgardia, said: “Inspiring the public to dream about space travel and tackle the final frontier is vital to the success of our endeavours – even the Apollo programme, that ultimately put a man on the Moon, was scrapped largely due to a lack of public support in the US.</p>
      <p>“But with nearly a third of UK with an ambition to visit space, it is clear to see that this support is not unattainable.</p>
      <p>“One of the keys will be to help people feel as though they are a part of something bigger and more tangible than just watching a rocket launch or following the fate of a satellite due to crash into a comet.</p>
      <p>“Asgardia aims to provide this, with over a million followers already, the space nation offers the opportunity to contribute to the exploration of space.</p>
      <p>“From running for a seat in our Parliament to tackling the scientific challenges associated with space living, democratising space exploration is a key goal of ours.”</p>
