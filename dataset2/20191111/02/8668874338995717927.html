      <p>England rugby coach Eddie Jones wants to coach in the NRL, and a Sydney newspaper has named the club he supposedly wants to take over.</p>
      <p>Australian Jones went from hero to zero at the Rugby World Cup, where England’s brilliant semifinal win over the All Black was followed by a disastrous performance against the Springboks in the final.</p>
      <p>The highly quotable Jones has become rugby’s most recognisable character, <a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/rugby/news/article.cfm?c_id=80&amp;objectid=12283831">and the World Cup reversal has left plenty of conjecture over his future</a>.</p>

      <p>He wouldn’t be the first former Wallaby coach named Jones to head to the NRL, and the similarity doesn’t stop there.</p>
      <p>The great 1980s coach Alan Jones – another outspoken character – became the Balmain Tigers boss and then football manager at the South Sydney Rabbitohs.</p>
      <p>Long time <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i> columnist Danny Weidler has reported that Eddie Jones wants to coach the South Sydney Rabbitohs, where league legend Wayne Bennett currently reigns.</p>

      <p>“The noise around Eddie Jones had him in line for the Wallabies coaching job — but the truth is there is another gig that he really covets,” he wrote.</p>
      <p>“NRL clubs take note, Jones would like a crack at rugby league at some point in his career.</p>
      <p>“Even though he has one of the highest-profile and highest-paying positions in world rugby, there is a part of Jones that wants to test himself. As far as tests go, taking on an NRL job is a big one.</p>
      <p>“From what I can gather, he has told mates that taking over from Wayne Bennett when he finishes at Souths appeals. He has a soft spot for the club. It’s doubtful the Rabbitohs would be aware of his ambitions because he has only shared his league thoughts with a select few.”</p>

      <p>Jones will have some inside information on the NRL after inviting Raiders coach Ricky Stuart into the English camp at the World Cup in Japan.</p>
      <p>Stuart himself is an example of the long cross-code tradition in Australia. He was a schoolboy rugby star and Wallaby tourist before becoming a league standout as a player and coach.</p>
      <p>“Eddie loves his league,” Stuart said. “The way the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/england">England</a> team played … let’s just say that I have never seen a rugby side play so similarly to a league side.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know if he wants to coach in the NRL. Could he do it? I have no doubt he could if that was on his radar. To transfer a coach from code to code … well they’ve never been closer, so yes, it’s doable.”</p>

      <p>Jones certainly loves a new challenge and has been involved coaching four different countries at the World Cup – Australia, South Africa, Japan and England.</p>
      <p>Weidler also claimed that the job Jones would really like in rugby <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/australia">Australia</a> is CEO.</p>
      <p>England rugby’s 2015 World Cup captain <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/harlequins/players/chris-robshaw/">Chris Robshaw</a> is among those hoping Jones stays where he is for now.</p>
      <p>“I do not know what the mood in the (England rugby) camp is but Eddie is the man to take it to the next World Cup,” he said.</p>
