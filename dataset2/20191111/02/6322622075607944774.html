      <p>TRADING of shares in DGB Asia Bhd (fundamental: 1.2/3, valuation: 0/3) triggered our momentum algorithm for the fourth time this year last Friday. The last time the counter triggered the momentum algorithm was last Wednesday.</p>
      <p>It closed a sen or 5.41% lower at 17.5 sen last Friday, giving the company a market capitalisation of RM132.33 million.</p>
      <p>The counter saw some 49.28 million shares traded, well above its 200-day average trading volume of 2.54 million shares.</p>
      <p>For the third quarter ended June 30, 2019, DGB Asiaâ€™s net losses widened to RM4.47 million, from RM711,000 a year earlier. However, revenue jumped to RM2.17 million from RM302,000. The group attributed the top-line growth to higher value-added products sold. Meanwhile, the higher losses were on account of higher operating costs and a higher share of loss from an associate company.</p>
      <p>For the cumulative nine-month period ended June 30, 2019, the group posted a net loss of RM7.88 million on revenue of RM6.48 million.</p>
