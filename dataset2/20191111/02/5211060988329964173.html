      <p>TORONTO - The Toronto Maple Leafs will be without the services of forward Mitch Marner longer than they hoped.</p>
      <p>The club announced on Sunday that Marner underwent an MRI exam on his injured ankle and will be out of the lineup for a minimum of four weeks.</p>
      <p>Marner sustained the injury in Saturday's 3-2 loss against the Philadelphia Flyers.</p>
      <p>He was hurt after falling awkwardly on his right leg off the second period's opening faceoff. He struggled mightily to get to the bench and went the locker room.</p>
      <p>He returned during a television timeout to test his ankle, but once again headed off and was done for the night.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old has four goals and 18 points in 18 games with the Maple Leafs this season after signing a six-year, US$65.3 million contract in September.</p>
      <p>He led Toronto last season with 94 points in 82 games.</p>
