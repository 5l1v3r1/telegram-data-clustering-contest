      <h1>Axis REIT’s Phase 2 projected to increase FY21 earnings</h1>

      <p><b>Axis Real Estate Investment Trust<br/>(Nov 8, RM1.75)<br/>Initiate coverage with neutral and a target price (TP) of RM1.77:</b> Axis Real Estate Investment Trust (Axis REIT) has one of the most active asset acquisition track records among the REIT players in the country. The main assets targeted are industrial assets with long-term leases. That said, we believe that near-term earnings growth upside is quite limited given the lack of sizeable new assets in the pipeline. We initiate coverage of Axis REIT with a “neutral” call and dividend discount model-derived TP of RM1.77. A key catalyst is the Phase 2 of Axis Mega Distribution Centre.</p>
      <p>We estimate its financial year 2020 (FY20) distribution per unit growth to be mainly driven by organic growth (with steady occupancy rates and positive rental reversions) and new assets targeted to be completed in FY19 (totalling about RM258 million) which include Axis Aerotech Centre, its Bayan Lepas industrial facility and a few other manufacturing facilities. Given oversupply of office properties in the Klang Valley, we believe the headwinds will prevail for a while for the market to absorb the incoming supply. That said, we believe Axis REIT’s earnings are somewhat buffeted as its pure office assets only represent 6% of total net lettable area (NLA).</p>
      <p>Axis REIT is keen to develop the remaining 50% of NLA (about 50 acres [20.23ha] of land size) of Axis Mega Distribution Centre in the near term (known as Phase 2) — a plan similar to its major redevelopment of Phase 1 for Nestle (Malaysia) Bhd. Axis REIT plans to develop the site into a grade-A distribution centre with green mark qualification and a flexible modular space configuration. This asset, if it materialises, is projected to increase its FY21 earnings per unit by approximately 4%. —<i> PublicInvest Research</i>, Nov 7</p>
