      <p><a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/the-good-place/"><i>The Good Place</i></a> stars <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/d-arcy-carden/">D’Arcy Carden</a>, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/manny-jacinto/">Manny Jacinto</a> and <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/marc-evan-jackson/">Marc Evan Jackson</a> stopped by <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/vulture-festival-2019/">Vulture Festival</a>’s Vulture Spot with host <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/jamie-loftus/">Jamie Loftus</a> this weekend to discuss what they initially thought would happen with their characters, since they were just as in the dark about the NBC sitcom’s twists and turns as we were. While Carden and Jacinto might not have known Janet and Jason would develop feelings for each other (which makes sense, seeing as how Janet is an all-knowing cosmic AI, rather than a person with feelings), one of the show’s production assistants spotted sparks between the pair starting on “Day One.” Unfortunately, they had to snuff her out to keep the plot point secret, but them’s the breaks when you write a show based entirely on the unknown.</p>
