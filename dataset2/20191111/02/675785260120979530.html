      <p>Police are now firing tear gas at protesters on the eastern side of Hong Kong, following the shooting earlier today.</p>
      <p>The latest violence comes after a student died in hospital last week following a high fall as protesters were being dispersed by police.</p>
      <p>Protesters are angry about what they see as police brutality and meddling by Beijing in the former British colony's freedoms, guaranteed by the "one country, two systems" formula put in place when the territory returned to Chinese rule in 1997.</p>
