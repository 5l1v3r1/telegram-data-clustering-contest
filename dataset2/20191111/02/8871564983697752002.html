      <p>At least two protesters were injured after a traffic cop appeared to deliberately ram his motorbike into a crowd of people during a citywide protest that kicked off today.</p>
      <p>In videos circulating online, the officer can be seen circling back and zig-zagging into a crowd of black-clad protesters who had gathered on Hing Fong Road in Kwai Fong in what appears to be an attempt to run them over.</p>
      <p>The police bike’s siren was also on.</p>

      <p>According to Headline Daily, <a href="http://hd.stheadline.com/news/realtime/hk/1633663/%E5%8D%B3%E6%99%82-%E6%B8%AF%E8%81%9E-%E5%A4%A7%E4%B8%89%E7%BD%B7-%E8%91%B5%E8%8A%B3%E4%BA%A4%E9%80%9A%E8%AD%A6%E9%96%8B%E9%9B%BB%E5%96%AE%E8%BB%8A%E8%A1%9D%E5%90%91%E4%BA%BA%E7%BE%A4-%E8%87%B3%E5%B0%912%E4%BA%BA%E5%8F%97%E5%82%B7">at least two people were injured at the scene</a>, although the nature of the injuries was not clear as of press time.</p>
      <p>The video began circulating just over an hour after similar videos began making the rounds showing <a href="https://coconuts.co/hongkong/news/at-least-one-protester-shot-with-live-round-as-citywide-boycott-hits-city/">at least one protester being shot in the torso with a live round</a> in Sai Wan Ho this morning.</p>
      <p>Today’s protests come after <a href="https://coconuts.co/hongkong/news/student-who-fell-from-tseung-kwan-o-car-park-dies/">a university student passed away</a> on Friday after succumbing to a brain injury sustained in a fall at a car park during a police dispersal operation in Tseung Kwan O a week ago today.</p>
      <p>As of press time, several universities have announced that classes will be canceled, and the Transport Department has said that there have been disruptions to train and bus services, and that multiple train stations — <a href="https://www.td.gov.hk/en/special_news/spnews.htm">including Kwai Fong</a> — are now shut.</p>
