      <h1>Apple Card sparks gender debate, Steve Wozniak flags wife's credit rating</h1>
      <h2>On Saturday, Wozniak said he got 10 times more credit on the card compared with his wife.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T02:53:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 02:53</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-apple-inc">Apple Inc </a>co-founder <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/steve-wozniak">Steve Wozniak </a>joined in the online debate over accusations of gender discrimination by the algorithm behind the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/iphone">iPhone </a>maker's credit card, fuelling scrutiny of the newly launched Apple Card.</p>
      <p>The criticism started on Thursday, after entrepreneur David Heinemeier Hansson railed against the Apple Card in a series of Twitter posts, saying it gave him 20 times the credit limit his wife received.</p>
      <p>The much anticipated titanium credit card, part of a broader effort by Apple to derive greater revenue from services after years of heavy reliance on <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/iphone">iPhone </a>sales, was launched in August, in partnership with Goldman Sachs Group Inc.</p>
      <p>In an email, Goldman said Apple Card applicants were evaluated independently, according to income and creditworthiness, taking into account factors such as personal credit scores and personal debt.</p>
      <p>It was possible for two family members to receive significantly different credit decisions, the bank said, but added, "We have not, and will not, make decisions based on factors like gender."</p>
      <p>Hansson, who is the creator of web-application framework Ruby on Rails, did not disclose any specific income-related information for himself or his wife but tweeted that they filed joint tax returns and that his wife had a better credit score.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, Wozniak chimed in with a similar experience, saying he got 10 times more credit on the card, compared with his wife.</p>
      <p>"We have no separate bank or credit card accounts or any separate assets," Wozniak said on Twitter, in reply to Hansson's original tweet.</p>
      <p>"Hard to get to a human for a correction though. It's big tech in 2019."</p>
      <p>New York's Department of Financial Services said it was beginning an inquiry into Goldman Sachs' credit card practices.</p>
