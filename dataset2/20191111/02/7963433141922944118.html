      <p>Amazon on Monday said it plans to <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/amazon-will-launch-new-grocery-store-as-alternative-to-whole-foods/">open its first new brand of grocery store in California next year</a>, as it amps up its ambitious push to become a bigger name in food. From a report:<i> "Amazon is opening a grocery store in Woodland Hills in 2020," an Amazon spokesperson confirmed to CNET on Monday morning, soon after the company published four new jobs postings for the location. Woodland Hills is a neighborhood in Los Angeles. The store will be different from Amazon-owned Whole Foods, the company said. It didn't say whether it will open more of these locations, what its selection or pricing will be, or what the brand name is. But in the jobs postings, the company described the Woodland Hills location as "Amazon's first grocery store," suggesting that it will have the Amazon brand name and that the company could expand to multiple sites.</i></p>
