      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T02:37:36+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 02:37</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal boss Unai Emery is 'doomed' because he is 'at war with his players'</p>
      <p>That's according to pundit Garth Crooks, who says Gunners players looked like "schoolchildren terrified of their headmaster" in their 2-0 defeat to high-flying <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> City on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Arsenal's defeat was a big blow to their top-four hopes, with Leicester climbing into second place and opening up a nine-point gap over Emery's side.</p>
      <p>The pressure is increasing on Emery, with the Gunners are now in sixth place, with an eight-point deficit to make up to catch fourth-placed <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> .</p>
      <p>Crooks picked two Leicester players in his Premier League <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50369880">team of the week</a> - goalscorer Jamie Vardy and defender Ricardo Pereira.</p>

      <p>In explaining his decision to pick Vardy, Crooks said: "Twenty goals in 22 games for Leicester since the arrival of Brendan Rodgers at Leicester tells me that the former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> and Celtic manager is doing with Jamie Vardy precisely what Unai Emery is not doing at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> .</p>
      <p>"Everybody at Leicester looks like they love playing for Rodgers and no-one more so than Vardy.</p>
      <p>"Meanwhile Emery, who looks like he's eaten a lemon before his post-match interviews, always appears to be at odds with his players. A manager who is constantly at war with his players is doomed."</p>
      <p>Arsenal had the likes of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Alexandre Lacazette, Nicolas Pepe and Mesut Ozil at their disposal on Saturday, but could not breach Leicester's defence.</p>

      <p>Former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> and Stoke City forward Crooks said of Leicester: "Eight wins in 10 league games and the best defensive record in the Premier League says it all.</p>
      <p>"Exactly how much of that is down to Ricardo Pereira is difficult to quantify. What I can say is the Portugal international was outstanding against an Arsenal team who looked in total disarray.</p>
      <p>"The Gunners have some very talented players so why are they looking like a team of nervous school children terrified of their headmaster?"</p>
