      <p>PARIS: Over 10,000 people turned out north of Paris on Sunday (Nov 10) for a march against Islamophobia that drew criticism from both the government and the far right.</p>
      <p>It was called following last month's attack on a mosque in the southern French city of Bayonne by an 84-year-old man, a former far-right activist, who shot and wounded two men.</p>

      <p>Many of the protesters carried placards denouncing attacks on Islam, a number of women taking part wore traditional Muslim veils, while others had adopted veils bearing the blue, white and red colours of the French flag.</p>
      <p>Around 13,500 people attended the march, according to a count carried out by the Occurence consultancy and commissioned by the news media, including AFP.</p>
      <p>The march was called by a number of individuals and organisations, including the Collective against Islamophobia in France (CCIF).</p>

      <p>It also came as the debate over the veil has been revived in France and against a background of several militant attacks in France in recent years.</p>
      <p>"We came to sound the alarm, to say there is a level of hate you don't go beyond," one marcher, Larbi, a 35-year-old businessman, told AFP.</p>
      <p>"We are open to criticism, but you mustn't go beyond certain limits of aggression," he added.</p>
      <p>
        <b>'SCANDALOUS PROPAGANDA'</b>
      </p>
      <p>"We want to be heard ... not pushed to edge of society," Asmae Eumosid, a veiled woman from the suburbs of Paris, told AFP.</p>
      <p>"You hear a lot of nonsense about Islam and about veiled women today," the 29-year-old, who works as an engineer in the car industry, added.</p>
      <p>"With or without the veil, we are sick of being the last in line," said a nurse, Nadjet Fella, who said she had campaigned in Algeria against pressure to wear the veil there.</p>
      <p>"I chose not to wear it, but it hurts me that those who wear it are picked on," she added.</p>
      <p>In the southern city of Marseille Sunday, several hundred people staged a similar demonstration, carrying placards that read "Islamophobia kills" and shouting "We are all children of the Republic".</p>
      <p>Claudine Rodinson, a 76-year-old pensioners came with a group of the radical left Lutte Ouvriere (Workers Struggle) party.</p>
      <p>"There is a scandalous propaganda waged against Muslims," she said, adding that jihadist terrorism was deliberately equated with Islam.</p>
      <p>France has between five and six million Muslims, according to the latest studies, which makes it the second largest religion in the country - and the largest Muslim community in Europe.</p>
      <p>But France is fiercely protective of the secular principles of its constitution, banning the wearing of religious symbols in state schools, for example.</p>
      <p>
        <b>POLITICAL ROW</b>
      </p>
      <p>Last week, the Socialist party formally distanced itself from the demonstration, objecting to a reference to oppressive laws concerning Muslims - thought by some to be a reference to the 2004 law banning the wearing of veils in schools.</p>
      <p>It said it would organise its own demonstration at a later date.</p>
      <p>Critics also accused some of the 50 original signatories to the petition calling for the march of having links to political Islam -Â including the CCIF itself.</p>
      <p>A number of far-left politicians, including Jean-Luc Melenchon, the firebrand leader of France Unbowed party, nevertheless joined the Paris rally Sunday.</p>
      <p>Several members of the government meanwhile made it clear they had no sympathy for the march.</p>
      <p>Gabriel Attal, a junior minister with responsiblity for young people denounced the what he said was the opportunism of those left-wing politicians supporting the march.</p>
      <p>And Elisabeth Borne, junior minister for ecology, said the march was only setting people against each other.</p>
      <p>Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Rally, also condemned the march in a tweet Sunday.</p>
      <p>Radical Islamism had killed far more Muslims in France than Islamophobia, she argued. "This reveals the extent of your fraud!" she added.</p>
