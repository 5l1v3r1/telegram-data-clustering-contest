      <h1>Jack Fincham throws shade at Kris Boyson for snap with Katie Price's daughter Princess</h1>
      <h2>Kris Boyson come under fire from Jack Fincham when he shared his latest Instagram post with Katie Price's daughter</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T16:48:52+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 16:48</time> by <a rel="author">Lily Waddell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/lily-waddell/</a></address>
      <p>Jack Fincham laid into Katie Price's toyboy Kris Boyson for his latest <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> post.</p>
      <p>The Love Island 2018 winner proved overly critical of the model's social media picture which he uploaded on Sunday.</p>
      <p>In the snap, Kris beamed brightly into the mirror for his selfie while he was photobombed by his girlfriend's daughter Princess.</p>
      <p>They have developed a close bond since he started dating her mother Katie.</p>
      <p>He joked in the caption: "Photobombed!"</p>
      <p>Clearly unimpressed, the pen seller left a very sarcastic remark on Kris' latest Instagram post he had shared with his fans.</p>

      <p>Katie had no qualms with the photograph as she posted a gushing comment beneath the picture of her daughter and her toyboy boyfriend.</p>
      <p>She wrote: "You look handsome here and so cute That princess drives you nuts all the time."</p>

      <p>Katie and Kris had been due to join the Celebs Go Dating line-up when Jack starred on the show earlier this year.</p>
      <p>But the couple pulled the plug on their hotly-anticipated appearance which caused much disappointment among the cast and fans alike.</p>
      <p>It is not known why Jack has decided to launch a venomous attack on Kris.</p>
