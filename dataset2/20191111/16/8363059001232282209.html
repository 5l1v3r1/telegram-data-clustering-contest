      <h1>NHS England Approves Two Cannabis-Based Medicines for Prescription</h1>

      <p>The advisors in charge of giving new NHS treatments the Yes or the No have decided in favour of two cannabis-based treatments for the first time, opening the doors to easy access to the formerly controversial medicines in England.</p>
      <p>The two drugs are mainly to be used for treating epilepsy and multiple sclerosis; conditions that self-prescribers and medicators have been successfully DIY treating with under-the-counter or over-the-border cannabis products for years. The <a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng144">new NICE guidelines</a> say the medicines based on the delta-9-tetrahydrocannibinol and marketed as Sativex or under the generic term nabilone may also be issued to patients suffering chemotherapy-induced nausea, although treatment-resistant epilepsy and some of the more extreme multiple sclerosis cases are the main anticipated use area.</p>
      <p>One of the drugs is based on cannabidiol – and branded Epidyolex – and solely targets the heartbreaking cases of debilitating epilepsy in children. Obviously the psychoactive elements of the drug are not present in these commercial products, while the cost of Epidyolex – which previously ruled it out from being made available on the NHS – has been reduced by manufacturer GW Pharmaceuticals to help swing its move into potentially wider distribution.
