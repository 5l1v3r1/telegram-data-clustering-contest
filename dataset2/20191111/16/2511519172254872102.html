      <h1>Hillary Clinton says male leaders are ‘scared’ of Greta Thunberg</h1>
      <h2>Thunberg ‘incredibly threatening’ to a lot of people, says Chelsea Clinton</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/HillaryClinton">Hillary Clinton</a> has said that male politicians are “scared” of 16-year-old climate activist <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/greta-thunberg">Greta Thunberg</a>.</p>
      <p>The former US secretary of state made the comments on Sunday night at the Southbank Centre’s Royal Festival Hall whilst promoting a new book she has written with her daughter Chelsea.</p>
      <p><i>The Book Of Gutsy Women: Favourite Stories Of Courage And Resilience</i> focuses on the women who have inspired the mother and daughter, and features Thunberg, whose solitary <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/climate-change">climate strike</a> outside the Swedish parliament in 2018 left them “so moved”. </p>
      <p>“It’s been fascinating to watch how scared a lot of grown up male leaders are of this young 16-year-old girl who speaks up about the threat of climate change,” she said.</p>
      <p>Clinton added that a young woman speaking her opinions still had the power to “rattle” the “ancient DNA” that still perpetuates throughout society. </p>
      <p>“It is maddening to think how much that still operates,” she said.</p>

      <p>“You could probably take some of the people who have been so critical of her [Greta] on social media and in other settings, attach them to a lie detector and say ‘don’t you think that’s a bit sexist’”.</p>
      <p>Chelsea said that people in the US are attacking Thunberg because they cannot attack the science surrounding climate change. </p>
      <p>“More broadly, her [Thunberg’s] real clarity and fearlessness and just being so unbowed and relentlessly focused on the future I think is incredibly threatening to a lot of people,” she said. </p>
      <p>The panel discussion was chaired by historian Mary Beard, who also appears in the book alongside Billie Jean King, Malala Yousafzai and Florence Nightingale. </p>
      <p>Clinton also shared her concerns for the future of politics in both the US and UK, stating that she had “always admired Britain”. </p>
      <p>“I am, as a great admirer, concerned because I can’t make sense of what is happening.</p>
      <p>In a swipe at President Trump, Clinton added: “We have a president who admires dictators and takes their help and does all kinds of crazy stuff.</p>
      <p>“We need you to be the sane member of this partnership going forward,” she said. </p>
