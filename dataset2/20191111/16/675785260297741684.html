      <h1>Dr Miriam Stoppard: Crack down on anti-MMR parents for children’s sake</h1>
      <h2>The anti-vaxxers are ­having their way and London is seeing the worst drop ever in MMR vaccination rates for children</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T16:30:29+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 16:30</time> by <a rel="author">Miriam Stoppard, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/miriam-stoppard/</a></address>
      <p>I ask myself, do I have to write about this again, and the answer comes back, yes you do because nothing is changing. The anti-vaxxers are ­having their way and London is seeing the worst drop ever in MMR vaccination rates for children.</p>
      <p>I have to raise a voice on our ­children’s behalf.</p>
      <p>The UK was declared measles-free in 2017, but we have lost that ­cherished status. This prompted a pledge from Boris Johnson last month to take on the anti-vaccine movement.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, has said groups promoting anti-vaccination messages have “blood on their hands”. Labour MP Paul Sweeney has said failure to vaccinate children should be a “criminal offence”.</p>
      <p>Simon Stevens, head of NHS England, has said: “‘It’s as irresponsible to tell parents (on social media) that their children shouldn’t be vaccinated as it is to say don’t bother to look both ways when they cross the road.</p>
      <p>“Vaccine hesitancy” has been described by the World Health Organisation as one of the 10 worst health threats facing humanity, and has been blamed on the spread of anti-vaccine campaigners across social media.</p>
      <p>So why have so many parents become reluctant to vaccinate?</p>
      <p>“The reasons are complex,” explains Dr Heidi J Larson from the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine. She says some are dedicated to refusing vaccination as a mission.</p>
      <p>“Some have religious objections. Others want freedom from government control, big business or big pharma,” says Larson. She reveals serious reactions to the jab are very uncommon.</p>
      <p>"For example, measles will lead to brain swelling in one in 1,000 people, whereas this occurs in only 1 in 100,000 as a result of the vaccine.</p>
      <p>Larson concludes: “It is far safer to vaccinate than not.”</p>
      <p>I know vaccines may not be perfect, but the alternative – exposing children to infectious, sometimes deadly diseases – is much worse.</p>
      <p>The rate of hospitalisation for measles is about one in five, and the mortality rate is about one in 1,000.</p>
      <p>Even worse, measles suppresses the immune system for up two years leaving children vulnerable to even minor infections. The MMR vaccine makes the immune system stronger.</p>
      <p>So should we be introducing compulsory vaccination of children before school?</p>
      <p>Or say that schools shouldn’t admit children who haven’t been vaccinated? And should all parents be asked to prove their four- or five-year-old has had their two­ ­recommended doses of the MMR vaccine? It may be time to consider draconian measures.</p>
