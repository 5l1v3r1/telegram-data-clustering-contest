      <p>It’s not something that happens too often for Kamohelo Mokotjo, so his big smile was to be expected after the Bafana Bafana star opened his Brentford account for the season this weekend.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The 28-year-old got a goal and an assist on Saturday as the Bees cruised to a 3-0 victory over Wigan Athletic, and the Bafana man will have been very pleased with his finish as he smashed home on his left foot from the edge of the box.</p>
      <p>Mokotjo is expected to start for South Africa on Thursday night when they go into battle with Ghana in the first of their 2021 African Cup of Nations qualifiers, and Molefi Ntseki can expect to welcome a midfielder who is high on confidence having won four of his last five games at club level.</p>
      <p>Brentford now find themselves in ninth place in the English Championship following their fine run of form of late, and are now within touching distance of the play-off places as they look to try and make a promotion push in 2019/20.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Mokotjo and the other foreign-based Bafana players are set to meet up with their Absa Premiership counterparts in the next 24 hours as they jet out to Ghana to the Cape Coast where they face the Black Stars on Thursday night.</p>
