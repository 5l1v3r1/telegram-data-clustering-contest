      <p>Mayo footballer Cillian O'Connor has become involved a newly-launched specialist financial services recruitment firm called Spot Recruitment.</p>
      <p>He has teamed up with David Butler and Pat Hughes in the business initiative.</p>
      <p>O'Connor, who qualified as a primary school teacher, intends to balance his new business career with his football commitments.</p>
      <p>He told RTE: "Over the last few months, we've been getting everything in place, getting procedures and polices in place, and that's been quite time consuming but I've been able to balance that with the club season over the recent past, and hopefully that will continue into next season with Mayo."</p>
      <p>Spot Recruitment will focus on recruiting finance professionals for industry and for financial services firms including banks, insurance companies, accountancy firms, investment firms, aircraft leasing companies and corporate finance advisors.</p>
      <p>"I'm hoping a lot of the skills honed at high level sport will transfer to the business sphere," Mr O'Connor said.</p>
      <p>"I've played almost ten seasons now. Leadership is one thing that you have to have in sport to be able to drive on performance.</p>
      <p>“I think communication with so many stakeholders, like team mates, management, supporters, sponsors, media, all those skills that I've had to develop over the years will be useful in business too," he added.</p>
