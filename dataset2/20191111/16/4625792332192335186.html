      <h1>Amazon opening 'first grocery store' in California as alternative to Whole Foods</h1>

      <p>Amazon announced it would be opening a new grocery store in California as the company looks to expand into the grocery market beyond its purchase of Whole Foods.</p>
      <p>"Amazon is opening a grocery store in Woodland Hills in 2020," a representative for the company <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/amazon-will-launch-new-grocery-store-as-alternative-to-whole-foods/">told</a> CNET on Monday. The company said the store would differ from Whole Foods but did not expand on its prices or offerings.</p>
      <p>The grocery store is being heralded as "Amazon's first grocery store," according to job listings. In 2017, Amazon purchased Whole Foods for $13 billion and has used the grocery chain as a launchpad to expand into the industry and offer grocery home deliveries.</p>
      <p>The continued expansion into the market was <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/business/amazons-grocery-expansion-raises-antitrust-risks-for-bezos">rumored back in March</a> but was not confirmed by the company until today. The company's plan is to open dozens of stores in major U.S. cities with the first being built in California.</p>
      <p>"Amazon flexing its muscles in the broader grocery space poses a threat to traditional food retailers," Brian Nowak, a New York analyst at Morgan Stanley, said back in March. "It now seems the Whole Foods acquisition was a shot across the bow, which enabled Amazon to learn the ins and outs of physical grocery retail."</p>
