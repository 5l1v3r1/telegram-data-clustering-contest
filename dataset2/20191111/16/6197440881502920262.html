      <h1>Pixel 4 XL ends up barely behind iPhone 11 in battery stress test [Video]</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T16:11:53+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 16:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/nexusben1/" target="_blank">Ben Schoon</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/10/31/google-pixel-4-review/">worst aspect of Google’s 2019 flagship line</a> is the battery life, but it’s been well-known since day one that the larger Pixel 4 XL fares better. Now, a battery test puts the Pixel 4 XL against the iPhone 11, and the results are very surprising.</p>
      <p>PhoneBuff, the same YouTuber who put the Pixel and iPhone <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/02/pixel-4-performance-test-iphone-video/">in a performance test earlier this month</a>, is back with a <a href="https://youtu.be/rg06HFi7vb4">battery test</a>. While it doesn’t truly reflect the use of the average person, this test does give us a good idea of just how well the Pixel can hold its own against the iPhone.</p>
      <p>The test eliminates as many variables as possible by matching the brightness, speaker volume, and charges of the two phones right from the get-go. After that, both devices are subjected to a one-hour phone call on the same network. Then the two devices are put through messaging for an hour to simulate a real-world conversation using a chatbot. At this point, the two devices are only separated by a couple of percentage points.</p>
      <p>Further tests include one hour of email usage and then one hour of web browsing. This brings the Pixel 4 XL’s battery down to 66%, where the iPhone 11 is at 72%. Scrolling through Instagram for an hour causes both devices to lose 10% of their batteries. Next up is a standby test where both devices are left alone for 16 hours with the Pixel dropping by 14% and the iPhone by 10%.</p>
      <p>Rounding out the test is an hour of watching YouTube videos where the iPhone continues to pull ahead as well as an hour of gaming. Once they jump into <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/10/25/google-pixel-4-disables-90hz-display-apps/">Google Maps</a>, the Pixel 4 XL dies after 43 minutes using the app. The iPhone finally dies an hour later in a Spotify streaming test.</p>

      <p>The final results put the Pixel 4 XL’s battery at 7 hours and 43 minutes of screen time and 16 hours of standby. The iPhone 11, on the other hand, manages exactly one hour more at 8 hours and 43 minutes of screen time and the same 16 hours of standby.</p>
      <p>While the Pixel did comes behind Apple’s more affordable device, it’s really not a bad total at the end of the day, considering the higher resolution, faster refresh rate, and more power-hungry internals.</p>
      <p>Pixel 4 XL battery life isn’t as bad as everyone says, folks.</p>
