      <p>Did you spend any time on social media this past weekend? If you did, there’s a very strong chance you ran across Tweets promoting the #ReleaseTheSnyderCut movement. These dedicated fans have been vocally lobbying Warner Bros. to release the extended cut of <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/1464489/justice-league">the 2017 movie <i>Justice League</i></a>, the version that Zack Snyder has constructed since the time that he walked away from the project in May of that year. But this past weekend, the movement received a lot of celebrity support… and that could lead to a huge reveal on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Let’s do a quick catch up. Though the members of the #ReleaseTheSnyderCut movement have been active on a daily basis <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484238/all-the-superman-movies-ranked">trying to raise awareness</a> for the existence of Zack Snyder’s version of <i>Justice League</i>, they received several significant votes of confidence recently that continued to tell them that they are fighting the good fight for a worthy cause.</p>
      <p>The first post arrived on Vero, where Zack Snyder himself <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484316/zack-snyder-shares-glimpse-at-deleted-justice-league-scene-for-the-flash">shared a photograph</a> of <i>Justice League</i> co-star Ezra Miller and his love interest, Kiersey Clemons, who would have played Iris West in the DCEU. His caption read, "Cute Couple.”</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Not one to be out-done, vocal Zack Snyder supporter (and current Aquaman) Jason Momoa <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484345/aquaman-stabs-steppenwolf-in-badass-snyder-cut-look-shared-by-jason-momoa">shared an image</a> on his own social media pages that showed Arthur Curry impaling the villain Steppenwolf on his trident while Wonder Woman looked on.</p>

      <p>The duo was standing in front of a Boom Tube, proving that this shot came from the celebrated <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483683/yes-jason-momoa-has-seen-the-snyder-cut-of-justice-league-and-its-very-different">Snyder Cut of <i>Justice League</i></a>. And Zack Snyder also weighed in on Vero that it would take a superpowered punch to get Steppenwolf all the way over to Diana. That prompted <i>Justice League</i> storyboard artist Jay Oliva (an ardent #ReleaseTheSnyderCut supporter) to share this tantalizing image:</p>

      </figure>
      <p>And finally, Cyborg star Ray Fisher got in on the action as the weekend drew to a close by Tweeting out this photo of a still shot from a scene with his character, Victor Stone, that was not in the theatrical cut of <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483465/justice-league-composer-confirms-the-snyder-cut-of-the-score"><i>Justice League</i></a>. He also used the hashtag, keeping the momentum of the movement alive.</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/rehsifyar/status/1193341507606106114?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <p>Which leads to the biggest question: Why is all of this happening now? There was a huge wave of attention brought to the movement when Momoa told MTV that he recently watched the cut. This stems from the actions of the group at New York Comic-Con recently, where they took out a digital billboard in Times Square to promote the existence of the cut, and the efforts by the group to get it released.</p>
      <p>And that has supporters looking ahead to Sunday, November 17, which is <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482325/see-a-new-wonder-woman-shot-from-zack-snyders-justice-league-snyder-cut">the two year anniversary</a> of the release of the theatrical cut of <i>Justice League</i>. And this year, it’s a day that the RTSC family wants to use to secure the version that they believe they are entitled to.</p>
      <p>There’s <a href="https://twitter.com/RTSnyderCut/status/1193687848551141376">a marketing push</a> in place for every day this week, hoping to get #ReleaseTheSnyderCut trending.</p>

      <p>With more events planned for Sunday. It’s a day that has been two years in the making, and the recent progress from celebrity members INSIDE of the <i>Justice League</i> family lead us to believe that something special, something impressive, could be on the horizon. The final decision lies with Warner Bros. Snyder has said that he has his cut, and that it’s finished. With <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481672/joker-box-office-the-clown-prince-of-crime-is-king?pv=search"><i>Joker</i></a> on the cusp of crossing $1 billion, and DC being rewarded for betting on directors and allowing them to complete their visions, is it now, officially time to Release the Snyder Cut?</p>
