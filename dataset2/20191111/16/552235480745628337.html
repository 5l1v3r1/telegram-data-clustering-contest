      <h1>The number of drink and drug drivers in Renfrewshire goes up</h1>
      <h2>Scottish Government stats show a 10 per cent increase over the last 12 months</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T16:47:17+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 16:47</time> by <a rel="author">David Campbell</a></address>
      <p>Police recorded more than 4,000 motoring offences in Renfrewshire in a year.</p>
      <p>Statistics released by the Scottish Government for 2017/18 show cops in the region flagged 4,021 drivers.</p>
      <p>Despite an overall fall of five per cent on the previous 12 months, figures show a ten per cent increase in the number of drivers getting behind the wheel under the influence of drink or drugs.</p>
      <p>In 2016/17, police recorded 212 offences, rising to 233 last year, involving thoughtless drink and drug drivers.</p>
      <p>Traffic cops pulled over 572 speeding drivers last year, down on the previous year.</p>
      <p>Police Scotland kicked off a week-long safer driving campaign at the weekend, aimed at catching drivers speeding, using their mobile phones or not wearing seatbelts.</p>
      <p>Led by the force’s Road Policing Unit and supported by Safety Camera Units, officers want to highlight the importance of wearing a seatbelt in the front and back seats, regardless of the type of vehicle you are in.</p>
      <p>Wearing a seatbelt can prevent more serious injuries being inflicted, particularly if you are sitting in the rear of a vehicle.</p>
      <p>Figures revealed that in 2017, 27 per cent of people who died in cars in Britain were not wearing a seatbelt.</p>
      <p>Chief Inspector Simon Bradshaw said: “We know that using a mobile phone, driving while distracted, travelling at inappropriate speeds and not wearing a seatbelt are significant factors in fatal and serious injury crashes.</p>
      <p>“This is why we take the matter seriously as they are avoidable, which makes it all the more tragic when people are killed in road crashes under these circumstances.</p>
      <p>“Police Scotland works closely with other road safety agencies and partners to highlight the importance of driving safely but we cannot do this alone. We need motorists to take road safety seriously and to change their behaviour.</p>
      <p>“We will interact with drivers through education to influence behaviour but where necessary, we will take enforcement action.”</p>
