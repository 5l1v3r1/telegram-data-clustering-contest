      <blockquote>"According to the preliminary data, UK citizen Le Mesurier died as a result of his fall from height at about 05:30 a.m. on Monday. Their body has numerous fractures ... According to the preliminary data, no strangers were seen in the house at the time of his death. After the body was examined by forensic experts, it was sent to a morgue," the source said.</blockquote>
      <p>Turkish media reported citing police sources that Le Mesurier's neighbours <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201911111077278912-founder-of-white-helmets-james-le-mesurier-found-dead-in-istanbul---reports/">found his dead body</a> in the early hours of Monday in the garden of his house.</p>
      <p>A law enforcement source confirmed later the death of Le Mesurier though it remains "unclear whether he was murdered, or committed suicide."</p>
      <p>Le Mesurier, who was also a former officer of the UK Secret Intelligence Service, created the controversial 'urban search and rescue' White Helmet organisation in 2013.Â </p>
