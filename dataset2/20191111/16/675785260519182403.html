      <p>A young girl has accused her brother of rape after finding out she is eight months pregnant.</p>
      <p>The 10-year-old only found out about her pregnancy when she went to hospital with her mum after complaining of pain in her back and abdomen, local media reports.</p>
      <p>The incident is reported to have taken place in the city of Posadas, in the northern Argentina province of Misiones.</p>
      <p>When doctors checked the child, it was found that she was near the end of her pregnancy, with just one month to go until her due date.</p>
      <p>It's reported that the mum knew nothing of the alleged sexual abuse in her family and was shocked to hear her daughter was expecting.</p>
      <p>She is due to give birth before the end of the year.</p>
      <p>The girl was taken to the Doctor Fernando Barreyro, in Posadas, where she was told the news.</p>
      <p>She allegedly claimed her 15-year-old brother had raped her.</p>
      <p>The case was raised to a special women only police station and it is now being investigated by the minors' judge Marcela Leiva and prosecutor Maria Laura Alvarez.</p>
      <p>Special police stations of this kind are geared towards the needs of those who have suffered from gender violence.</p>
      <p>Local reports says the victim did not understand what was happening to her and claims she was raped only once.</p>
      <p>The Department of Social Development reported that the brother of the victim, whose name has not been revealed, has been removed from the family.</p>
      <p>The girl's mother is to be granted custody over the child and the Justice Department wants the child to continue with her education after the birth.</p>
