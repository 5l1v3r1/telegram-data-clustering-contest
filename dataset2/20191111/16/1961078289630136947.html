      <h1>Please, No More Trump Jokes</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T16:00:11+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author">Blayr Austin</a></address>
      <p>In his new Netflix comedy special “Lobby Baby,” Seth Meyers <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/04/media/seth-meyers-skip-politics-button-netflix/index.html">allows viewers to avoid his political jokes</a>: Those who tune in to the special have the choice, about 40 minutes in, of hitting the “skip politics” button (not unlike the “skip intro” button the streaming platform offers) and jumping ahead to apolitical commentary. The decision, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/04/media/seth-meyers-skip-politics-button-netflix/index.html">he told CNN</a>, came out of his concern that some of his audience might be tired of hearing jokes about President Trump and the federal government.</p>
      <p>The button is actually part of a setup for a joke meant to entice viewers who choose to skip the political section to go back anyway and catch what they missed, but Mr. Meyers is on to something. As a comedy writer, I’m absolutely exhausted by humor about President Trump and the upcoming election. I’m surrounded by comedians who are relentless in their pursuit of political humor, regardless of how redundant or mean the jokes are. I find myself having fierce debates about political issues with people with whom I’ve never disagreed before. Talk of impeachment has only made things worse.</p>
      <p>I recently began going to fewer comedy shows to avoid further political burnout — I was looking for an escape from the real world to no avail.</p>
      <p>The political climate is wearing down many other Americans. In <a href="https://news.unl.edu/newsrooms/today/article/stressed-out-americans-making-themselves-sick-over-politics/">a report released in September by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln</a>, close to 40 percent of the people polled said they were stressed out by politics, and one in five said they have been losing sleep.</p>
      <p>There’s never a moment of reprieve from the chaos of news, and this is especially true when it comes to humor. It is often argued that it’s the comedian’s job to bring attention to the cracks in our institutions, government and society — to speak truth to power. I believe this is true, and I appreciate the work late-night comedians like Stephen Colbert, Samantha Bee and Trevor Noah do in addressing important issues like gun control, abortion and immigration.</p>
      <p>However, much of the satire in the Trump era lacks carefully considered subtext. Many of the jokes from both sides are cruel and lack punch lines. On social media, insults are hurled at a rapid rate and further antagonize the already divided. Women in particular are often targeted with misogynistic comments and jokes when they express their political views — in an interview with NPR, Ms. Bee said that comments in her Twitter mentions “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/03/06/518771517/samantha-bee-on-trump-s-win-i-could-feel-this-seismic-shift">went into violence</a>” on the night of the 2016 election.</p>
      <p>There are so many other matters beyond the day-to-day happenings at the White House that warrant comedy’s attention. The amount of time being spent on superficial insults could be allocated to more thoughtful comedic commentary that makes us consider pressing matters, like the work of W. Kamau Bell. On his docuseries “United Shades of America,” he demonstrates that sensitive subjects related to race, such as the Ku Klux Klan, can be confronted in ways that are both biting and revealing<b>.</b></p>
      <p>Yet there should also be more room for humor having nothing to do with politics, especially in periods of unrest. Thankfully, some veteran comedians have remained in this lane. Part of Jerry Seinfeld’s appeal has long been his apolitical nature; he generally avoids joking about specific news events in favor of funny observations of everyday life. He’s relatable to many, regardless of their political affiliations.</p>
      <p>Jim Gaffigan turned down the opportunity to host the White House Correspondents’ dinner in 2018. He later said that while he “<a href="https://edmontonjournal.com/entertainment/celebrity/comic-relief-gaffigans-clean-comedy-centred-around-family-food-and-fatherhood">consumes a lot of news</a>,” he didn’t feel like the right person for the job — “people come to my shows as a break from it.”</p>
      <p>And on his late-night talk show “Lights Out With David Spade,” Mr. Spade refuses to talk about politics. “<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jul/24/david-spade-to-avoid-bashing-trump-on-late-night-s/">I don’t want half the crowd tuning me out</a>,” he explained of this creative decision. Instead, the show concentrates on less polarizing topics such as <a href="http://www.cc.com/video-clips/9h57ua/lights-out-with-david-spade-keanu-reeves-s-rumored-love-life">Keanu Reeves’s love life</a>. The show’s <a href="https://www.broadcastingcable.com/blog/david-spade-late-night-show-wont-touch-politics">executive producer </a><a href="https://www.broadcastingcable.com/blog/david-spade-late-night-show-wont-touch-politics">Tom Brunelle</a> said, “The show provides a half-hour break from the onslaught of politics.”</p>
      <p>We seem to have forgotten that comedy can play an important role in deflecting from the stressors of life and bringing us together. There’s nothing wrong with taking a temporary break from politics, if only for a minute or two, to crack a corny dad joke. There’s a certain power in letting our guard down: We need calmness and clarity to have effective political discourse.</p>
      <p>I became a comedy writer to entertain people, not to divide them. I try to write jokes that appeal to as wide an audience as possible. It’s discouraging to see so much discord over content that we consciously write and have control over, unlike political events. My goal is to offer hope and help people cope with everyday challenges. I’d rather find commonality among many than contribute to a toxic political environment that divides us.</p>
      <p>There’s room for both scathing political satire and jokes about a trip to Ikea or a nightmare family gathering at the holidays. To encourage a balance doesn’t undermine the importance and urgency of political issues. It just means we can give ourselves permission to briefly opt out by pressing the “Skip Politics” button. We all might get a better night's rest.</p>
