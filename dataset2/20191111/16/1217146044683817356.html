      <p>A public early beta preview of the semi-tethered checkra1n iOS jailbreak based on the iOS Checkm8 exploit developed by security researcher Axi0mX in September was released over the weekend.</p>
      <p>checkra1n can be used to jailbreak all iOS devices running up to iOS 12.3 between the iPhone 5s and the iPhone X, with the addendum that this beta version currently does not support iPad Air 2, iPad 5th Gen, and iPad Pro 1st Gen.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://github.com/axi0mX/ipwndfu">Checkm8</a> exploit is an extremely rare unpatchable bootrom exploit that can be used against most generations of iPhones and iPads, from iPhone 4S (A5 chip) to iPhone 8 and iPhone X (A11 chip).</p>
      <p>While the exploit allowed the checkra1n team to create a jailbreak tool, it should be noted that it cannot be abused remotely and that threat actors who would want to use it would also need physical access to the iOS device. Hence the semi-tethered nature of the jailbreak.</p>

      <h3>Some devices still waiting for support</h3>
      <p>Additionally, support for iPhone 5s, iPad Mini 2, iPad Mini 3, and iPad Air is still experimental and, as the tool's development team says, "may require more attempts than usual."</p>
      <p>At the moment, checkra1n can only be used to jailbreak iPhones and iPads on Mac computers, with support for the Windows and Linux platforms to be added at a later time.</p>
      <p>checkra1n's devs recommend backing up the devices before jailbreaking since this release is still in an early beta preview and it should not be installed on primary devices.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://checkra.in/releases/">second checkra1n public beta preview</a> comes with fixes for several bugs including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>An issue where the loader app would crash when installing Cydia on iPads</li>
        <li>A crash when the macOS language was set to anything other than English</li>
        <li>An issue where iPad Minis would not work with the GUI</li>
        <li>An issue with the <code>scp</code> binary not working as expected</li>
      </ul>
      <p>"At the moment, checkra1n only supports installing Cydia. Support for other package managers is coming soon, and will not require a checkra1n update," the development team added.</p>
      <p>As its website says, jailbroken iOS devices will revert to the stock system if the users reboot them without checkra1n and they will no longer "be able to use any 3rd party software installed until you enter DFU and checkra1n the device again."</p>
      <h3>Previously used as a bait in a scam campaign</h3>
      <p>If you plan to download and use checkra1n, make sure you avoid similar-looking domains because they are more often than not used in malicious campaigns just as the one spotted by Cisco Talos researchers in October.</p>
      <p>Scammers were spotted at the time <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/scammers-use-fake-checkra1n-ios-jailbreak-in-click-fraud-campaign/">baiting iOS users with a yet unreleased checkra1n iOS jailbreak as the lure</a> in a campaign designed to help the crooks earn money via click-fraud and by boosting App Store rankings for several apps.</p>
      <p>Some of the users targeted by this online scam caught on and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/dhaub2/discussion_warning_there_is_a_fake_website_for/">warned others</a> on Reddit to be careful and not to fall for the fraudsters' tricks.</p>
      <p>Sadly, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/dhaub2/discussion_warning_there_is_a_fake_website_for/f3lovb4/">some</a> were tricked by thatscam, while others brought up a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/dhaub2/discussion_warning_there_is_a_fake_website_for/f3mea4z/">similar fake jailbreak website</a> hosted at unc0ver.[]vip that clones the site of the legitimate unc0ver jailbreak tool downloadable at unc0ver[.]dev.</p>
