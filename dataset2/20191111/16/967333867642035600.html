        <b>The news comes after negotiations between the British steelmaker failed with Turkish military pension fund Ataer, forcing the UK company to seek further assistance after falling into administration in May.</b>
      </p>
      <p>British Steel may secure a £70m rescue package from Chinese steelmaker Jingye Group, who employs over 22,000 staff and exports steel products globally, helping the troubled UK company to keep thousands of jobs.</p>
      <p>The Official Receiver, who has been managing the administration, is expected to announce the decision later today.</p>

      <p>Over 4,000 employees and a further 20,000 jobs in British Steel's supply chain rely on the deal, including its plants in Scunthrope and Lincolnshire. The proposal may also be seen as a major step towards saving Britain's steel manufacturing base in the UK, which has declined in recent years.</p>
      <p>Director of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, Henri Murison, said that a rescue deal from the Chinese would be "very welcome news".</p>
      <p>It was time to embrace cooperation with Beijing, who is working with countries worldwide via the Belt and Road global development strategy, he said <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-britishsteel-m-a-jingye/chinas-jingye-group-in-talks-to-buy-british-steel-idUKKBN1XL0Q5">as quoted by Reuters</a>, adding that Chinese firms have also bought a steel plant in Serbia and the country's only copper mine.</p>

      <p>The news comes after talks with Ataer Holdings stalled in October, following intense weeks-long negotiations which <a href="https://sputniknews.com/business/201908161076564891-turkish-military-pension-fund-named-preferred-buyer-for-insolvent-british-steel-uk-govt-confirms/">began in August</a> to formalise the deal, where the Turkish military pension fund offered a nearly £1bn lifeline alongside the UK government's £300m in commercial loans, grants and other sources of funding.</p>
      <p>The Official Receiver <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/british-steel-limited-in-liquidation-information-for-customers-employees-and-creditors">said at the time</a>: “While discussions with Ataer are continuing, discussions with other parties who have expressed continued and renewed interest in acquiring the whole British Steel business will now be possible.</p>
      <blockquote>"Meanwhile Ataer remain very much interested in acquiring the business and we remain in detailed discussions with them to conclude a sale," the OR added.</blockquote>
      <p>British Steel was ordered by the UK High Court to undergo "compulsory liquidation" in late May after failing to receive a £30m in emergency funds, and was temporarily managed by administration firm Ernest and Young (EY) during its insolvency.</p>
      <p>The UK's second-largest steelmaker was <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201905211075203292-British-Steel-collapse-Greybull/">owned by Greybull Capital</a>, who also managed Tata Steel and Monarch Airlines, after the private investment company paid Tata £1 to acquire British Steel in 2016. But Monarch Airlines fell into administration in 2017, despite seeking similar bailouts.</p>
