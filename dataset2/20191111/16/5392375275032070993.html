      <p>Last week, IDC <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prAP45640019">released</a> the Q3 global mobile phone report and now the firm has posted a new report solely targeted at the Indian mobile phone market.

Xiaomi still leads the market, whereas Realme showed the highest growth.</p>
      <p>As per Upasana Joshi of IDC India, the online channel witnessed a record-high market share of 45.4% with YoY growth of 28.3% thanks to attractive cashback and buyback offers as well as No Cost EMIs and other financing options. On the other hand, offline channel viewed 2.6% YoY decline even though the offline players tried to counter online players with their offers.</p>
