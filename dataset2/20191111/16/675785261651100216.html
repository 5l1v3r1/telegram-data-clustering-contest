      <h2>You season 2 will see Penn Badgley reprise his role as the psychopathic stalker Joe for a new horrific romance</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T16:37:13+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 16:37</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Knight, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/lewis-knight/</a></address>
      <p>We finally know when You is back on Netflix.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/netflix">Netflix</a> has confirmed that You season 2 will be released on December 26, 2019.</p>
      <p>That will be a nice creepy treat for Boxing Day!</p>
      <p>The new season looks set to adapt the sequel novel to You by Caroline Kepnes, <b>Hidden Bodies</b> .</p>
      <p>The novel sees Joe Goldberg ( <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/penn-badgley">Penn Badgley</a> ) move to Los Angeles and find a new obsession in aspiring chef, Love Quinn.</p>
      <p>However, not only does Joe need to hide his monstrous behaviour with Beck, but he now also has to deal with the complication of his ex Candace, who is now back in town.</p>
      <p>The series will be very different to the novel, however, despite the setting of LA and arrival of Love in Joe's life.</p>
      <p>Hidden Bodies sees Joe head to LA to murder an ex called Amy when he meets Love, but in the series he will have just killed Beck.</p>
      <p>We also have a dramatic poster from Netflix for the new season.</p>

      <p>The new episodes will star The Haunting of Hill House actress Victoria Pedretti as Love Quinn, while also featuring James Scully as her domineering brother, Forty Quinn.</p>
      <p>Gotham star Robin Lord Taylor and Russian Doll actor Charlie Barnett also join the cast in major recurring roles, while Ambyr Childes is back as Candace, along with John Stamos as therapist Dr. Nicky, who Joe framed for killing Beck.</p>
      <p>Whatever happens it's bound to be creepy.</p>
