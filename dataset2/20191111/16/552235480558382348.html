      <h2>Denai McDougall, 19, was popular in Balloch and Clydebank</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T16:17:28+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 16:17</time> by <a rel="author">Jenny Foulds, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/jenny-foulds/</a></address>
      <p>Tributes have been paid to a young mum who would “light up every room she went into” after she died suddenly.</p>
      <p>Denai McDougall, 19, passed away on Friday, October 25 leaving behind her two-year-old son Kalvin.</p>
      <p>The former Balloch woman’s heartbroken friends have set up a GoFundMe fundraiser to help the mum-of-one’s family pay for her funeral.</p>
      <p>They are also planning a fundraising event in January for little Kalvin, with money raised to be paid into his savings account.</p>
      <p>One of the fundraising organisers is Taylor McGee, who had been friends with Denai since their primary school days.</p>
      <p>She said Denai’s death has rocked those left behind.</p>

      <p>“We’re all trying to be strong but there’s definitely been a lot of tears,” she said.</p>
      <p>“We feel Denai’s death has brought us all together again as a group and together we all want to do our part to make sure she is remembered in the best way possible.</p>
      <p>“It’s come as a shock to us and still hasn’t quite sunk in that we won’t see our best friend again.”</p>
      <p>Taylor said her friend was originally from Clydebank but lived in Balloch for a couple of years before moving back to her home town.</p>
      <p>She said she was “an amazing mum”, adding: “She would light up every room she went into.</p>
      <p>“She was a kind, caring person who was always laughing.</p>
      <p>“As soon as her son, Kalvin came into her life he was instantly her priority.</p>
      <p>“He meant the world to her and brought her so much happiness.</p>
      <p>“Denai was an amazing mum.</p>
      <p>“She always put Kalvin first and he absolutely adored her.”</p>

      <p>Taylor organised the online fundraiser alongside Andrea Murphy, Shannon Maitland, Megan Hollywood, Paige Wright, Amie McIntosh, Lauren Johnston, Shanna Menzies, and Kathleen Short who’ve all been showing their support.</p>
      <p>So far over £1,300 has been raised.</p>
      <p>On November 1, crowds gathered to show their support for Denai’s loved ones at Dalmuir Park in Clydebank for a balloon release, fireworks and music.</p>
      <p>A Facebook page, Remembering Denai McDougall, has been set up to allow people to pay their respects and keep followers up to date with any future fundraising events.</p>
      <p>Denai’s devastated best friends, who’ve rallied together in the wake of her death, have paid tribute to their “angel”.</p>
      <p>Andrea Murphy told our sister paper the Daily Record: “ If I could see this smile one last time, I’d never ask for anything again.”</p>
      <p>“I’ll miss the smile she brought on all our faces,” pal Shanna Menzies added.</p>
      <p>Megan Hollywood said: “There are no more tears left for me to cry, I would do anything to give you one last hug.”</p>
      <p>“We will all do our best to make your gorgeous boy’s life happy and full of love,” Paige Wright added.</p>
      <p>“My heart has broken into a million pieces, we will meet again my angel,” Lauren Johnston said.</p>
      <p>Shannon Maitland added: “I will always remember you as the happy bubbly one who put everyone’s feeling before your own.”</p>
      <p>“Your beautiful boy will always know how much he is loved and how amazing you are,” Kathleen Short said.</p>
      <p>And Emmie Gallacher added: “Sometimes you will never know the value of a moment until it becomes a memory.”</p>
