      <p>To help celebrate the 2019 <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/league-of-legends/2248"><i>League of Legends</i></a> World Championships, Riot Games has put out yet another music group: True Damage.</p>
      <p>Riot Games has been making music and matching skins for <i>League of Legends</i> for years now. There have been metal band skins for a made-up group called <a href="https://www.riftherald.com/culture/2017/8/3/16089826/pentakill-2-album-lol">Pentakill</a>, k-pop-esque skins for K/DA, and now there’s a set of hip-hop skins for True Damage. While the skins are just paid-for cosmetics in the game, the music expands the game’s universe and makes these characters more relatable and interesting than they’d be as just a cosmetic.</p>
      <p>Even people who don’t play <i>League of Legends </i>may have noticed that Riot Games has been hyping up True Damage on their social media platforms for weeks. With the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/11/5/18064726/league-of-legends-kda-pop-stars-video-akali-ahri-evelynn-kai-sa">success of Riot’s last music project, K/DA</a>, many were curious as to what Riot was going to do to live up to expectations. As with last year, this new group is made up of fictional <i>League of Legends</i> champions, but they’re voiced by real-life musicians and celebrities. Unlike K/DA, this new group is a hip-hop group, not a k-pop group. True Damage is made up of five <i>League</i> champs, including Akali again from K/DA.</p>
      <p>The group performed their single, “Giants,” live during the opening ceremony for the 2019 World Championship Finals in Paris, complete with pretty cool holograms to supplement the singers.</p>

      <p>The group name, True Damage, is a term used in <i>League of Legends</i>. It’s the hardest hitting kind of damage, as it ignores any magic or physical resistances the victim has.</p>

      <p>Akali, a.k.a the ninja with the sweet neon outfit from K/DA, returns yet again. K-pop group (G)i-dle’s Soyeon voices her yet again. She’s far from the center of the video, but Soyeon spits some serious bars as Akali this year, too.</p>
      <p>Last year, Akali was the rapping member of K/DA, and fans took to her quickly. Her performance featured a scene where the lights went off and she wore a neon-painted outfit, glowing as she rapped in Korean and stole the show.</p>

      <p>Ekko, who is usually an inventor kid from the streets of Zaun — a dangerous and dark city in the world of <i>League of Legends —</i> really steals the show this year. He’s portrayed by two rappers, both of <i>Spider-Man</i><i>: Into the Spider-verse</i> soundtrack fame: Duckwrth and Thutmose.</p>

      <p>Qiyana, an assassin who harnesses the elements in her huge ring blade weapon, is voiced by Latin American pop-star Becky G. Qiyana also has <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/10/29/20936513/league-of-legends-louis-vuitton-skin-true-damage-qiyana-prestige">a special Louis Vuitton-designed outfit</a> she wears in the video that players can grab as an additional skin in the game.</p>

      <p>Senna, a railgun-using support who spent a chunk of her life trapped in a demon’s lamp, is voiced by actress and singer Keke Palmer. She’s also happily married to her beau, Lucian, another<i> League of Legends </i>champion.</p>

      <p>Yasuo, who is usually a samurai who can use his sword to command wind, is the group’s DJ. He has no spoken lines and does not have a voice actor. He still looks good, though.</p>
      <h3>Is this just a skin advertisement?</h3>
      <p>More or less, yes. All of these are now available as cosmetic skins in-game, for about $10 each. Ekko’s is a heftier $20, and Qiyana’s Louis Vuitton skin requires <a href="https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/esports/esports-event/learn-more-worlds-2019-event">buying an approximately $10 pass and grinding a lot of games</a>.</p>
      <p>It’s clear that passion was put into this music project, so it seems a little wrong to just label this as a huge skin advertisement, but it definitely is one at its core.</p>
