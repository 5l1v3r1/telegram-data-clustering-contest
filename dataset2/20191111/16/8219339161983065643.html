      <h1>Mini-review: Bandly is an Apple Watch band made from real wood</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T16:16:37+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 16:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/benlovejoy/" target="_blank">Ben Lovejoy</a></address>
      <p>You woodn’t have thought it possible, but yes, you can actually have an <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/apple-watch/">Apple Watch</a> band – something flexible that needs to wrap around your wrist – made from real wood!</p>
      <p>Bandly is the creation of Philadelphia-based designer Lorenzo Buffa, who previously used a patented technique to create the bands for analog watches. These have been sold in major museum stores like MoMA &amp; Guggenheim, and he’s now created versions for the Apple Watch…</p>
      <p>Buffa pitches Bandly as a way to have a bit of nature in our lives throughout the day, and help the environment at the same time.</p>
      <blockquote>It’s important to offset our overly connected life with small injections of nature. Could be a plant on your desk, eating lunch outside, or a daily reminder on your wrist. Even small interactions with nature have positive impacts on our cognition, psyche, &amp; overall well being.<br/><br/>A timepiece should inspire you. It should be an expression of self. It should be re-inventive. Why must tech look so… techy?<br/><br/>An earth friendly alternative to the rubber, metal, &amp; silicone options out there. We rescue lumber offcuts, a typical waste product, to produce incredibly strong wood bands.</blockquote>
      <p>Regular readers will know I’m a sucker for wood, so this was something I had to try.</p>
      <p>When you see and feel the flexibility, similar to a typical leather band, it’s hard to believe it’s actually made from wood, but it is. It’s a thin layer of wood, for sure, but the finish you see is the actual grain from the wood – it’s not something reconstituted and given an artificial pattern.</p>
      <p>You get a choice of Light Teak, Dark Teak, Maple, and Rosewood. Mine is the Light Teak model.</p>

      <p>The process blends a real wood finish with polyurethane backing and a transparent water-resistant coating. The result, says Buffa, is something that is durable and tough. The bands have been tested with 10,000 bends, 500 stabs with a steel sheet and 1,000 smashes.</p>
      <p>Mine hasn’t been subjected to any such treatment, but I have worn it for a trip to Buenos Aires, which my shoes can attest is a rather dusty city; I’ve slept in it, both on the plane and in bed; and I’ve worn it while washing my hands numerous times. It has happily taken all this in its stride and still looks brand new.</p>
      <p>I have to say that it’s attracted a surprising amount of attention! Even the airport security person asked about it, and it’s had a number of compliments.</p>
      <p>My daily driver Watch band is a third-party copy of Apple’s Link Bracelet (the version I have is sadly no longer available). I love the convenience of just slipping it on and snapping it closed in a second or two, so my other bands are languishing unloved in the wardrobe. I will most likely return to it just for that convenience, but I could see myself wearing Bandly more than any of my others.</p>
      <p>It’s a Kickstarter, so the usual cautions apply. However, the company has been around for seven years and says production is a done deal – it is using the platform primarily for marketing purposes, something which seems increasingly common.</p>
      <p>Pricing is $39, which I consider a bargain given the quality. If I’d had to guess at a price, I would have said $100. Well worth considering if you’re a fellow wood fan.</p>
