      <p>The Woolsey Fire destroyed more than 1,000 structures and scorched nearly 100,000 acres as it ravaged areas of Los Angeles and Ventura counties last November. <br/><br/>In the aftermath of the blaze, AIR7 HD was able to take a closer look at neighborhoods affected by the destructive fire right after the smoke cleared.<br/><br/>On the one year anniversary, AIR7 HD returned to those same neighborhoods to show signs of progress and what remains to be done. <br/><br/>Many of those hard-hit neighborhoods are still recovering one year later.</p>
