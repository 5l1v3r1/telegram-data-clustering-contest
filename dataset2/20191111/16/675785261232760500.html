      <h1>Arsenal chiefs release statement over Unai Emery's future amid slump</h1>
      <h2>The Gunners boss is under pressure after a run of just one win in their previous six league games leaves them eight points off the top four following the loss at Leicester</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T16:12:28+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 16:12</time> by <a rel="author">John Cross, https://www.facebook.com/johncrossmirror/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> have given under-fire manager <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/unai-emery">Unai Emery</a> a public show of support.</p>
      <p>The club’s head of football Raul Sanllehi and managing director Vinai Venkatesham met staff at a pre-planned get together for 200 staff and underlined their backing.</p>
      <p>They admitted that they do “need to improve” but still “firmly believe” Emery is the right man for the job to get them into the Champions League places.</p>
      <p>Arsenal are now eight points off the top four after the defeat at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> which brought more criticism from supporters after the weekend.</p>
      <p>Mirror Sport reported that the Arsenal hierarchy are behind Emery and now the hierarchy reiterated it to staff with a strong message.</p>

      <p>They told staff: “We are as disappointed as everyone else with both our results and performances at this stage of the season. We share the frustration with our fans, Unai, players and all our staff as they are not at the level we want or expect.</p>
      <p>“Things need to improve to meet our objectives for the season, and we firmly believe Unai is the right man for the job, together with the backroom team we have in place. We are all working intensively behind the scenes to turn things around and are confident we will.</p>
      <p>“We never take our fantastic support for granted. We hope we can all stick together and get behind the team in this challenging period, as together we are stronger.”</p>

      <p>Emery's position at the Gunners has looked increasingly strained, with their latest loss on Saturday meaning they've won just one of their last six in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Match of the Day pundit Danny Murphy has slammed the Spaniards tactics, and questioned whether he still has the backing of his players.</p>
      <p>He told talkSPORT: "You're <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> football club, you're trying to compete, you're trying to get back in the Champions League places and they have not got enough.</p>
      <p>"His hands are tied a bit in terms of the recruitment possibilities they have, but ultimately, they are tactically so inept.</p>
      <p>"When he first came there were lots of substitutions early in games, lost of tactical changes.</p>
      <p>"Maybe the players have lost faith a little bit, and that, unfortunately, subconsciously, creates a really bad physical reaction in terms of not believing what you're doing when you go out on the pitch, and it drains you."</p>
