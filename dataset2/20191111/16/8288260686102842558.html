      <h1>Aston Villa target tipped to complete big-money transfer - but there's a catch</h1>
      <h2>Aston Villa transfer news includes pundit's take on the future of Rangers striker</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T16:00:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author">Shane Ireland, https://www.facebook.com/ShaneIrelandJournalist</a></address>
      <p>Aston Villa-linked striker Alfredo Morelos will be sold by Rangers – but not until the summer.</p>
      <p>That’s the view of former Ibrox forward Kris Boyd, who thinks Morelos could set a new Scottish transfer record if he moves to the Premier League.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> have been <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-alfredo-morelos-rangers-17103860">credited with an interest in Morelos</a> as the 23-year-old enjoys the best form of his career in front of goal.</p>
      <p>He took his tally for the season to 22 in just 26 games with a second-half strike against Livingston on Sunday.</p>

      <p>Boyd thinks that Morelos’ excellent record means he’ll command a big fee – but only after Rangers have utilised his talents for the full season.</p>
      <p>He told the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-transfer-news/kris-boyd-predicts-whopping-alfredo-20855545">Daily Record:</a> "When you see some of the transfers down the road, the numbers are crazy but for me, strikers are very hard to come by and especially ones who are scoring goals.</p>
      <p>"I've said it, Rangers can't accept anything for him in January. This season in terms of how he has improved - not only his goalscoring but his all round play - he's been excellent. I don't think it was particularly his best game for Rangers today but he was involved in everything going forward.</p>
      <p>"The only wee criticism I have of Alfredo Morelos is when he's in front of goal and has no time, his instincts are brilliant. See when he has time, he overthinks things.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"Overall right now he's in the form of his life and to answer the question, it would be in the summer and it could be anything. Anything in terms of north of £20m because he can score goals and it is very difficult to get a striker who can do that right now in world football.</p>
      <p>"Strikers right now in world football are about asking problems, stretching the back four and playing one up front. He can do the lot. He's shown it in Europe. There's the criticism of him against Celtic as well but I know how hard it is to score against Celtic and when that comes, there will be more money added on."</p>
