      <p>The <i>James Bond</i> franchise may be over half a century old but every time a new adventure movie starring 007 is announced, fans go wild. It seems people are far from done with the missions of Bond and with <i>No Time To Die</i> coming out in 2020, the anticipation for what’s in store next is reaching fever pitch. One super exciting member of the <i>No Time To Die</i> team is <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/phoebe-waller-bridge-revealed-what-she-thinks-the-hot-priests-christmas-sermon-would-be-19312209">Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who has explained her involvement with Bond</a> in a recent interview with the BBC.</p>
      <p>The announcement that <i>Killing Eve </i>and <i>Fleabag</i> creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge was being brought in to work on the<i> No Time To Die</i> script was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/31/phoebe-waller-bridge-james-bond-film-must-treat-women-properly">met with resounding excitement</a> from fans. And in a new interview with the BBC, she has laid out exactly how she contributed to the whole process.</p>
      <p>Waller-Bridge says she was simply <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-50331077">brought in to “help out”</a> with the script, explaining that “they were just looking for tweaks across a few of the characters and a few of the storylines.” Speaking about the experience, Waller-Bridge said "it doesn't get cooler" than writing lines for <i>James Bond</i>.</p>

      <p>One of the reasons Waller-Bridge has built such a huge and loyal fanbase is because she’s so vocal about the role of women in front of and behind the camera. Speaking to<i> </i>Deadline about <i>No Time To Die</i> and what the <i>Bond</i> franchise can do to keep up with modern times, she said: “It has <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/05/phoebe-waller-bridge-bond-1202624860/">just got to grow.</a> It has just got to evolve, and the important thing is that the film treats the women properly. He doesn’t have to. He needs to be true to this character.”</p>
      <p>However, as Waller-Bridge explained to the BBC, the reason she was brought in to look over the script had nothing to do with re-imagining the culture of the film and how women were portrayed in it. "They <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-50331077">were already doing that themselves</a>," she said. "They're having that conversation with themselves the whole time. [My involvement] was much more practical. Just, 'You're a writer, we need some help with these scenes. And you come up with some dialogue for these characters.'" Clearly there were some <i>Fleabag </i>and <i>Killing Eve </i>fans among the <i>Bond </i>team who knew all about Waller-Bridges genius flare for killer dialogue.</p>
      <p>Fans have speculated as to whether the writer will be making an appearance in <i>No Time To Die</i>, but the BBC said she’s made it clear that <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-50331077">that won’t be the case.</a></p>
