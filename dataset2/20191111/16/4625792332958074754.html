      <p>The Air Force <a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2019/11/09/air-force-ids-special-tactics-airman-lost-over-gulf-mexico.html">identified</a> 29-year-old Staff Sgt. Cole Condiff as the airman who fell from a C-130 during a training accident over the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
      <p>On Nov. 5, Condiff fell and is believed to have died during a training accident. On Saturday, the Air Force noted that the recovery effort for Condiff’s body was still underway.</p>
      <p>"The Air Force is actively investigating the incident," officials said. "To preserve the integrity of the investigation, no additional details will be released until further notice."</p>
      <p>Condiff joined the Air Force in 2012 and served two overseas deployments in Africa and Afghanistan. He grew up in Spokane, Washington, and was a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
      <p>In the Air Force, Condiff was trained as a static-line jumpmaster, military free-fall jumper, combat scuba diver, air traffic controller, and a joint terminal attack controller. He was awarded an Air Force Commendation Medal and an Air Force Achievement Medal for his service.</p>
      <p>"Cole was a man with deep-rooted beliefs who dedicated himself to God, our freedoms, peace, and his family. He was a devoted family man within our squadron, focused on teaching his girls to be adventurous like he was," U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Steven Cooper, Condiff's commander, said in a statement.</p>
      <p>He added, “This is a tragic loss to the squadron, the Special Tactics community and our nation. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends and teammates at this time."</p>
      <p>Condiff was a husband and a father to two young daughters. His family members shared tributes to him on social media.</p>
