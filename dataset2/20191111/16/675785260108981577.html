      <h1>Liverpool 'concerned' over Mohamed Salah injury after latest knock vs Man City</h1>
      <h2>The Egyptian forward has not fully recovered from an ankle problem he suffered following a robust challenge from Leicester's Hamza Choudhury last month</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T16:20:01+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 16:20</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> are said to be concerned about the ongoing ankle problem which is troubling <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/mohamed-salah">Mohamed Salah</a> .</p>
      <p>The Reds forward's ankle is yet to fully heal after injuring it against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> over a month ago.</p>
      <p>Salah took another knock on his ankle during Sunday's match with Man City, but has still reported for international duty.</p>
      <p>After chasing through on goal, Salah was caught up by City's Fernandinho, who retrieved the ball, but made contact with the Liverpool stars left ankle in the process.</p>
      <p>There were worrying looks around Anfield as Salah laid on the turf, with fears he may have aggravated his injury.</p>

      <p>He managed to continue after brief treatment, but was later substituted, and was seen with his ankle strapped up with ice at full-time.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/liverpool-engliverpool/story/3987872/sources-liverpool-concerned-by-latest-mohamed-salah-knock">ESPN report</a> that staff at Liverpool now have major concerns over the severity of his problem.</p>
      <p>Salah was forced off in the clash with Leicester after midfielder Hamza Choudhury clattered him in a tackle, causing the Reds man to sprain his ankle.</p>

      <p>Fortunately for Salah and Liverpool, the match was followed by the last international break, during which Egypt did not have a fixture, allowing him a period of recovery.</p>
      <p>However his injury is yet to completely clear, with boss Jurgen Klopp admitting recently that there is a persistent issue.</p>
      <p>Klopp said: "I think it is more really annoying - for him, not me - the fact that it always has a bit of fluid in, and he has to deal with it, we get it out and it comes back, and stuff like that."</p>

      <p>Salah has now jetted off on international duty with Egypt for their Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers with Kenya on Thursday and Comoros on Monday.</p>
      <p>He insisted on reporting for his country, but that has given Liverpool no time to assess the injury further, with Salah now set to undergo an assessment with Egypt's medical staff.</p>
      <p>Liverpool will be hopeful Salah comes back without any further niggles, with the Reds due for a busy period between now and the end of the year.</p>
      <p>They face two games per week until the new year, including a Merseyside derby, two Champions League ties, and a Boxing Day clash with title-chasers Leicester.</p>
      <p>Salah, 27, was on the scoresheet against City in the 3-1 win which opened up an eight-point lead over the Foxes in second.</p>
