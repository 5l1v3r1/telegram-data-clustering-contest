      <h1>'Big Bang Theory' star Kaley Cuoco is sick of talking about not living with husband Karl Cook</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T16:27:21+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 16:27</time> by <a rel="author">Tyler McCarthy</a></address>
      <p>Former “<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/the-big-bang-theory">Big Bang Theory</a>” actress <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kaley-cuoco">Kaley Cuoco</a> wants fans to back off when it comes to her decision not to live with her husband of more than a year, Karl Cook.</p>
      <p>The actress on Friday appeared on “<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/the-view">The View</a>,” where she said that she’s now living in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/vacation-destinations/new-york-city">New York City</a> while she films a new project. Meanwhile, Cook, a professional equestrian, does not live under the same roof as her -- and fans were quick to pounce on the news after she made it public.</p>

      <p>“I made headlines saying that we don’t live together yet. And people went crazy,” <a href="https://youtu.be/nqxvfcsXQBE">Cuoco explained</a>. “They couldn’t believe it."</p>
      <p>She added that the logistics of their relationship merit a little time in separate houses, as his business and horses require a more specific location. However, she says they’re currently building a house together that will accommodate their respective needs and that their marriage actually works well with a little distance at the moment.</p>
      <p>“We just haven’t been under the same roof. But by the way, it’s been working great and we love it,” she shared. “We love it, so I don’t know why people have such an issue.”</p>

      <p>Cuoco shared the same sentiments in October when she confirmed that she’s not living with Cook after celebrating their first anniversary.</p>

      <p>“Life is about balance," Cuoco <a href="https://extratv.com/2019/10/07/kaley-cuoco-on-not-living-with-her-husband-we-are-building-our-dream-house/">told Extra</a>. “It’s great — we are building our dream house, so we’re gonna be in our home together very soon. But as of now, it’s worked out fine for us. I have no problem with it."</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old previously discussed her “unconventional marriage” with Cook, telling <a href="https://www.eonline.com/shows/e_news/videos/293652/kaley-cuoco-admits-she-doesn-t-live-with-her-husband">E! News</a> that having their respective space is important to their relationship.</p>
      <p>“We have different locations that we’re at a lot. We’re not together every single day," she explained.</p>
      <p>The duo <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/big-bang-theory-star-kaley-cuoco-marries-karl-cook-in-horse-themed-ceremony">tied the knot in June 2018</a> in Southern California in a barn-themed wedding that included their many horses and dogs.</p>
