      <h1>Change to garden waste collection service 'would cause confusion'</h1>
      <h2>You will have to register online for the collection service</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T16:33:22+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 16:33</time> by <a rel="author">Edward Oldfield</a></address>
      <p>Householders will need to register online for the free kerbside garden waste collection in Plymouth next year.</p>
      <p>The decision by Labour Cabinet member Sue Dann was challenged by Conservatives at a committee meeting on Monday. </p>
      <p>Tory councillors claimed there was a lack of evidence to justify the change and predicted it would cause confusion for users, especially those who did not use the internet.</p>
      <p>They warned the change could lead to fly-tipping and questioned whether there were plans to introduce charges for the currently free service.</p>
      <p>But after a hearing lasting almost two hours to discuss details of the plan, the council’s Labour-dominated Call-in Committee voted to approve Cllr Dann’s decision.</p>
      <p>The Cabinet Member for Environment and Street Scene said the decision to introduce registration for the service via the council’s website was not about charging, but was designed to increase take-up and make it more effective and efficient.</p>
      <p>Cllr Dann said the change would provide better data to plan routes, which would reduce missed collections and wasted trips, and the list of registered households would be available on the collection team’s in-cab system. The aim was to encourage more people to use the service, increase recycling rates and cut fuel costs and carbon output. </p>
      <p>She said online registration was in line with the authority’s Digital First policy, and a new advocacy service being introduced in December at the council’s customer service centre would help people without digital access to register for services including garden waste collection.</p>
      <p>Households can put out up to four garden waste bags which are collected from homes between April and the end of October. The committee heard it was a non-statutory service currently used by 45 per cent of city households costing the council £950,000 a year. </p>
      <p>Conservative councillors asked repeatedly whether there were any plans to introduce a charge for the currently free service. </p>
      <p>Conservative Kevin Wigens asked Cllr Dann if she would rule out charges. She replied: “This is not about bringing in charging for garden waste, it is about getting people to register so we can deliver a more effective and efficient service.”</p>
      <p>Cllr Dann said a public information campaign was due to start this winter about the change, but that had been delayed by a restriction on council activity due to the General Election in December.  She said: “We will do everything we can through all the channels to get the message out.”</p>
      <p>Councillors were told that when the new arrangements start next year, bags will be still be collected from unregistered homes for an introductory period, and householders will be given information about how to sign up. Eventually collection from unregistered households will end and they will have to take their waste to a recycling centre.</p>
      <p>Cllr Maddi Bridgeman, one of three Conservatives who called in the decision for extra scrutiny, raised concerns about the elderly and disabled missing out on registration, and the potential for an increase in fly-tipping and extra trips to the recycling centres.</p>
      <p>She said that the information provided to councillors was “incomplete” and “severely flawed”, missing details on cost savings or the benefits to residents. Conservative Andrea Johnson questioned whether plans for the scheme were based on “guesswork”.</p>
      <p>Conservative Mark Deacon said there would be “mass chaos” when the scheme was rolled out and it would be a “nightmare” for people who could not use a computer.</p>
      <p>The committee was told registration was being introduced after comparing the service with other local authorities.  It would cut costs through better route planning which would cut fuel use and carbon output, and make the service more effective and efficient.</p>
      <p>Labour councillor Gareth Derrick said the registration scheme would help optimise an important and valuable service. Labour’s Darren Winter welcomed the new advocacy support for customers and said he was satisfied that registration for the collection service would not cause chaos.</p>
