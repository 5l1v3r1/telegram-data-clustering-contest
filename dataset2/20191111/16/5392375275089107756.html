      <p><a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/08/qualcomm-could-launch-snapdragon-865-in-december/">Not long ago</a>, Qualcomm has officially announced that it will hold the Snapdragon Technology Summit 2019 in Maui, Hawaii on December 3-5, 2019. At the event, the company is going to release the new generation of Snapdragon 865 mobile processor. As for now, some sources have disclosed the key parameters of the new processor. According to previously-leaked information, the Qualcomm flagship mobile chip will have two versions. One of them will integrate a 5G baseband, use a 7nm process, and support LPDDR5X memory and UFS 3.0 flash memory.</p>

      <p>Particularly, <a href="https://twitter.com/rquandt">Roland Quandt</a> has revealed that the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 processor will have two versions, currently codenamed Kona and Huracan. Since both codes are the names of the Hawaiian Islands, and Qualcomm has always held technical summits in Hawaii, the credibility of the information is quite high.</p>
      <p>In terms of performance and power consumption, the Snapdragon 865 will adopt Samsung’s 7nm EUV process and the latest semi-customized A77 architecture. It still uses the design of the large, medium and small cores. The main frequency of the large core is 2.84GHz, the main frequency of the medium core is 2.42GHz, and the frequency of the small core is 1.8GHz. As for the graphics card, it uses the Adreno 650.</p>
      <h3>The Snapdragon Will Use A High-Frequency A77 + Three A77 + Four A55 Core Design.</h3>
      <p>The UFS 3.0 is also a highlight on this Snapdragon 865. But in some sense, it’s not surprising. We mean it will be a top-echelon SoC. So it’s quite reasonable to see top-level storage in it.</p>
      <p>The benchmark of the Snapdragon 865 shows that the processor has a single-core score of 4,034 and a multi-core score of 12100. Also, the power efficiency of the chip will be increased by 20%. It is expected that the Snapdragon 865 will support LPDDR5 memory.</p>
      <p>Samsung’s 2020 flagship Galaxy S11 will likely have the Exynos 9830/ Snapdragon 865 dual version and support the 5G network.</p>
