      <h1>Teenage Mormon boy walked 14 miles to get help after Mexican cartel spared him from massacre</h1>

      <p>A 13-year-old boy whose family was killed by drug cartel gunmen in Mexico walked 14 miles to get help for his siblings who were injured.</p>
      <p>Devin Langford said the gunmen opened fire on the vehicle his mother was driving last week when they arrived to help a family member whose vehicle had broken down.</p>
      <p>Langford said he thinks the gunfire damaged the engine of the vehicle he was in, and his mother was unable to restart the car. He said his mother told him to “get down” as she prayed.</p>
      <p>“It felt like a lot of bullets,” he told ABC’s <i>Good Morning America </i>on Monday.</p>

      <p>His mother, Dawna Langford, and his younger brothers, Trevor Langford, 11, and Rogan Langford, 2, were killed in the massacre.</p>
      <p>“Afterward, they got us out of the car and got us on the floor and then they drove off,” Langford said.</p>
      <p>The children tried to flee after the gunmen drove away but most were too injured. Langford said he hid his younger sibling, who had a bullet wound to the chest, behind a bush while he went to get help.</p>
      <p>“I started walking because every one of them were bleeding really bad,” he said, adding that he was fearful that he was being followed by the people who killed his family.</p>
      <p>Langford’s father, David Langford, called his son a hero.</p>
      <p>“He gave his life for his brothers and sisters,” David Langford said.</p>
      <p>The family, American citizens who are part of a fundamentalist Mormon group who have called Mexico home for decades, have left the country since the massacre.</p>
