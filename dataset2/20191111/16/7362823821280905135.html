      <h1>Soledad O’Brien says CNN’s Brian Stelter ‘should be ashamed of himself’ over impeachment segment</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T16:31:31+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 16:31</time> by <a rel="author">Brian Flood</a></address>
      <p>Anchor-turned media exec Soledad O’Brien said CNN pundit <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnn-stelter-jeffrey-epstein-abc">Brian Stelter</a> “should be ashamed of himself” for comments he made on Sunday comparing upcoming impeachment hearings to an episode of television.</p>
      <p>O’Brien, a former CNN anchor, mocked Stelter’s response when he was asked how networks can get Americans interested in impeachment hearings.</p>

      <p>“I also think, episode one so to speak, matters a lot, and I hate to say that because we’re talking about basic democracy at risk here. But from a television perspective, Democrats have to come out strong in that first episode,” Stelter said Sunday on CNN. “For the same reason when we’re watching Netflix or listening to a new podcast, we only choose to keep listening if we’re interested in episode one.”</p>
      <p>CNN anchor Ana Cabrera <a href="https://twitter.com/AnaCabrera/status/1193655198897577986">tweeted video of Stelter’s comparison</a> and O’Brien took notice.</p>
      <p>“Why is CNN so stupid about important s--t? This is Cillizza-level inanity. Brian should be ashamed of himself,” O’Brien tweeted, referring the often-mocked CNN political analyst Chris Cillizza in the process.</p>

      <p>Stelter <a href="https://twitter.com/brianstelter/status/1193659257247477760">responded</a>, “Thank you Soledad. Your tweets are always so uplifting. This segment was informed by what a House leadership aide told CNN: ‘The first hour of a hearing and the first hearing has got to be a blockbuster.’ I think that person is right. If you disagree, say so!”</p>

      <p>O’Brien fired back, informing Stelter that <a href="https://twitter.com/soledadobrien/status/1193659844756221952">her tweet wasn’t intended</a> to be uplifting.</p>

      <p>“They’re intended to be accurate,” she wrote. “A house leadership aide might be – um -- wrong. Maybe good reporting on the issue will drive people to watch. Because it’s important. It’s not a game show and you should stop treating it as such.”</p>
      <p>Stelter <a href="https://twitter.com/brianstelter/status/1193667665950334977">then declared</a> that he’s “never” treated impeachment as a game show.</p>

      <p>“But you know -- given your line of work! -- that this event is happening on multiple levels. On one level: democracy. On another level: television. Multiple things, all true at the same time,” Stelter wrote.</p>
      <p>CNN was mocked earlier this year for revealing Democratic debate lineups with a game-show style “draw,” and the liberal network has also aired “CNN Quiz Show” in which anchors compete against each other.</p>
      <p>Stelter was also widely criticized on Sunday when he failed to mention the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/fired-cbs-news-staffer-jeffrey-epstein">hot mic tape</a> of ABC News anchor Amy Robach admitting her network refused to air her reporting on Jeffrey Epstein during his “Reliable Sources” media program.</p>
