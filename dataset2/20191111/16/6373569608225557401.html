      <p>The Chase has been taken off air to make way for another game show, it's been reported.</p>
      <p>Fans will no doubt have been expecting the popular ITV quiz to appear as usual from 5pm today.</p>
      <p>But it's being booted out of its usual slot by Cash Trapped - which also happens to be hosted by TV veteran Bradley Walsh.</p>
      <p>It's not entirely clear when The Chase is expected to make a return, reports <a href="https://www.examinerlive.co.uk/news/tv/chase-being-taken-air-today-17237671">Examiner Live.</a></p>
      <p>But popular Chaser and former I'm a Celeb star Ann Hegerty has assured fans it won't be gone for long.</p>
      <p>And she also shared some exciting news for hardcore Chase fans.</p>

      <p>In a tweet to one concerned viewer, she said: "CT is only on for five weeks, and this year we have TWO Christmas specials for you!!"</p>
      <p>The fan then asked if the next series of The Chase would start in December or January and Anne replied: "I have no idea, transmission schedule and recording schedule are quite seperate."</p>
      <p>Some fans are not happy about the scheduled change.</p>
      <p>Sue Goldsmith said: "Not happy that we are losing The Chase for Cash trapped. As much as I think you're great Bradders, it isn't the same as The Chase."</p>
      <p>Strictly Superfan said: "Please axe @CashTrapped , nobody likes it, and there will be a major uproar from the chase fanbase. I for one will not watch."</p>
      <p>And Stephanie Treasure said: "Um... what is this #cashtrapped coming on Monday @ITV ? Where is my beloved #TheChase ?!"</p>
      <p>ITV has been contacted for comment.</p>
