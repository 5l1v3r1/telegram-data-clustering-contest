      <h1>Facebook will finally let you customize the toolbar and hide notification dots</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T16:55:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 16:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/joefedewa/" target="_blank">Joe Fedewa</a></address>
      <p>The Facebook app (and website, for that matter) are not beloved by many people. Over the years, the social network has <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/facebook-ai-voice-assistant/">become incredibly bloated</a> with features. Many of these features can be found in the navigation toolbar. Things like Facebook Marketplace, Watch, Groups, and more. This is also where you can be inundated with the dreaded “red dots” for notifications about things you don’t care about. Thankfully, it looks like Facebook is rolling out some control for the navigation bar.</p>
      <p>According to a Facebook spokesperson, the company is rolling out navigation bar controls to “make it easier for people to connect with the things they like and control the notifications they get within the Facebook app.” That means you can finally remove all the features you never use. No more red dots for Groups, Pages, Events, and more. Facebook was <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/facebook-mute-notification-dots/">testing the removal of the dots</a> back in June.</p>

      <p>Previously, Facebook said they tailored the toolbar to the user. But it always felt more like what <i>Facebook</i> wanted you to see rather than what <i>you</i> actually wanted to see. The red dots are also clearly there to lure users in to check out areas of the site they may not normally visit. You can now easily remove that temptation and clean things up a bit.</p>
      <p>To access the new Shortcuts Bar Settings, simply long-press on any of the shortcuts in the navigation bar (top of the screen in the Android app). A menu will pop up with options to “turn off notification dots, remove from shortcut bar,” and “manage shortcut bar.”</p>
