      <h1>Scarlett Johansson and Chris Evans Want Their Marvel Movies With a Side of Auteur Projects</h1>

      <p>This Oscar season, those of us at Vulture<i> </i>are ready for every actor, director, and anyone else within spitting distance of a nomination to be asked to give their opinion on the matter of <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/martin-scorsese-says-marvel-movies-are-not-cinema.html"><i>Scorsese </i>v.<i> Marvel</i> (2019)</a>. At least <i>Variety</i> tapped two experts on the matter for its first “Actors on Actors” conversation: <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/oscar-predictions-marriage-story-honey-boy-harriet.html"><i>Marriage Story</i> and <i>Jojo Rabbit</i> Oscar-chaser Scarlett Johansson</a>, a.k.a. Black Widow, and <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/rian-johnson-knives-out.html"><i>Knives Out</i> bad boy Chris Evans</a>, a.k.a. Captain America. Johansson first brought up the controversy, which “seems kind of old-fashioned.” (Old-fashioned? Don’t tell Marty!) “Somebody had to explain it to me because it seemed so disappointing and sad in a way. They said, ‘I think what these people are saying is that at the actual theater, there’s not a lot of room for different kinds of movies, or smaller movies, because <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/disney-is-quietly-placing-classic-fox-movies-into-its-vault.html">the theater is taken up by huge blockbusters</a>,’” she told Evans. “It made me think about how people consume content now, and how there’s been this huge sea change with their viewing experience.”</p>
      <p>Evans replied, “I think original content inspires creative content. I think new stuff is what keeps the creative wheel rolling. I just believe there’s room at the table for all of it.” And for his part, Evans has gone outside the film industry for “new stuff,” starring in the short-lived <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/03/theater-review-lobby-hero-comes-knocking-again.html">2018 Broadway revival of Kenneth Lonergan’s play <i>Lobby Hero</i></a>. “You’re so good,” Johansson told him of the performance. “It’s like you’re my only actor friend that actually came to see the play,” Evans responded. But it wasn’t a Marvel role, so can we blame them? [<i>Wink</i>.]</p>
