      <h2>Chris and his wife Sarra welcomed their son Callum into the world in 2014 - 11 weeks early after Sarra underwent an emergency caesarean following a potentially deadly pre-eclampsia diagnosis</h2>

      <p>For most parents, their child’s first day of school is emotional. But for Olympic cycling legend Sir Chris Hoy and his wife Lady Sarra, watching their five-year-old son Callum walk into reception at the start of the new school year in September was ­particularly poignant.</p>
      <p>“It felt like a watershed moment for us,” says Sarra, 37. “There he was, among his peers, really fit and healthy, able to mix in and start in a mainstream school. When he was first born it felt like those things may never happen.”</p>
      <p>Callum’s entry into the world was certainly dramatic. In October 2014, at 27 weeks pregnant, Sarra was ­diagnosed with potentially deadly pre-eclampsia.</p>
      <p>It meant Callum had to be delivered by emergency caesarean section a ­fortnight later, 11 weeks early. He weighed just 2lb 2oz and spent his first two months in a neonatal unit.</p>

      <p>“I know a lot of people cry at the first day of school but I was just overcome with the sheer pleasure of watching him walk in. It was a celebration really,” says Sarra, who is an ambassador for Bliss, the UK’s leading premature baby charity.</p>
      <p>“It was a huge moment for our family,” adds Chris, 43.</p>
      <p>“Callum used to be able to fit into my two hands. Now he’s the oldest and tallest in his class and he’s loving it. It’s also the first time in his life where we haven’t gone in with a pre-emptive ‘By the way, Callum was born 11 weeks early’.</p>
      <p>“In the early years we had to work with a ‘corrected’ age based on when he should have been born, but now his teachers don’t even know that he was in a neonatal unit. There’s no caveat we have to explain because there’s no need any more.”</p>
      <p>The family has come a long way since the early days when a teacher friend warned them they would have to keep a careful eye on Callum, throughout school, due to his prematurity, “You can always tell the early ones,” she had said. It wasn’t meant to be unkind, but it unsettled Sarra, who admits, “It rattles you and gives you more things to be concerned about.”</p>

      <p>While the days when Chris was worried about leaving his family to go to work in case the worst happened are long gone, Sarra says the memories of Callum’s time in hospital – of “the brain scans, lung X-rays, heart monitors, countless blood tests and ventilators” – haven’t faded.</p>
      <p>“Not a day passes when I don’t get a flashback,” she says.</p>
      <p>Recalling those first months five years ago, Chris adds, “What I personally found difficult was that you’d arrive at the hospital in the morning and the nurse would give you an update, whether he’d had a good night or a disturbed night.</p>
      <p>They’d say ‘Callum likes this’ or ‘he doesn’t like that’ or ‘he can be a bit grumpy ­sometimes’ and you realise this is your own child you’re hearing about.</p>
      <p>“Normally that’s the parent’s job to be telling other people about what their child does and doesn’t like. That whole experience is quite tricky when it’s the first few days and weeks of bonding with your child.”</p>

      <p>One of the mementos the couple kept from Callum’s first weeks is a tiny nappy.</p>
      <p>“The nurses had to teach me how to change him, to navigate all the UV lines and chest drains and the TP line, which is like an umbilical cord feeding your baby,” says Sarra. “I remember sweating in a hot neonatal ward with my hands in an incubator like a Crystal Maze challenge.</p>
      <p>It’s tough going but it’s one of the few parental, normal things you can do for your baby when they are premature.”</p>
      <p>The couple, who now also have daughter Chloe, two, are joining forces with Pampers to help donate hundreds of ­thousands of the company’s tiniest nappies to UK hospitals.</p>
      <p>“The nappy we saved is nothing compared to what Pampers are producing now,” says Chris.</p>
      <p>“Even five years ago they were still far too big and had to be folded over for him several times.</p>

      <p>The smallest now are the size of my palm and for babies under a pound in weight – half the size Callum was. They have been designed to work around the wires, helping make nappy changes simpler for parents, as well as to prevent the baby’s sleep being disturbed.”</p>
      <p>One in 13 babies, more than 60,000, are born ­premature each year in the UK, needing specialist care, including nappies.</p>
      <p>Sarra adds, “From a parent’s point of view, you find yourself in this very shocking situation that you could never have anticipated. Knowing there’s a nappy that exists that is the right <br/>size for your baby just gives a bit of ­reassurance that families have been through this before. It gives hope.”</p>

          <b>World Prematurity Day is this Sunday (bliss.org.uk). For every pack of Pampers purchased in ASDA between now and December 31, Pampers – in partnership with Bliss – will donate a Pampers Preemie Protection nappy to a UK hospital. In addition, for every “hand heart” posted to social media using #PampersForPreemies, £1 will be donated to Bliss to support preemies’ much-needed sleep.</b>
