      <p>Craig Smith-Avery is an ex-serviceman and the practice manager of Knowle House Surgery - where it is believed money being raised for the Royal British Legion was taken on Friday.</p>
      <p>The box disappeared and was found empty in the waiting room by Mr Smith-Avery who was 'disgusted' and <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/scumbag-who-stole-poppy-collection-3525285">placed a sign in the surgery</a> to condemn the 'scumbag' thief.</p>
      <p>Mr Smith-Avery has been at the surgery for 23 years. Before that he served as a medic in the Royal Navy for 12 years until rheumatoid arthritis caused him to leave.</p>

      <p>He is passionate and proud to have spent time in the forces. Taking money from the nation's largest Armed Forces charity upset him enough to ban the thief and put up a sign.</p>
      <p>On the incident, he said: "On Friday lunchtime, I believe, a member of the public wanted to purchase a poppy.</p>
      <p>"My receptionist went to get the poppy jar, which we normally just keep behind reception, and couldn’t find it. She put out a message saying 'has anybody seen it?'</p>
      <p>"From that nobody came back saying they’d seen it. Everybody said it was on reception.</p>

      <p>"With that I wandered around the practice to have a look, and outside the practice. We’ve got a blind spot in our reception and I found the poppy jar behind the blind spot and it had obviously been forced open.</p>
      <p>"All the the contents, the money, were taken away.</p>
      <p>"I know my team are very saddened, upset and quite frankly disgusted that somebody would rob a charity, steal from a charity.</p>
      <p>"For me personally as an ex-serviceman I think it’s outrageous that they chose the poppy appeal to target.</p>

      <p>"I’d like to give a message to the person who did it. They’re not welcome at Knowle House Surgery anymore and I feel they should hold their head in shame at the fact that they feel they can steal from a charity."</p>
      <p>Craig estimates there was between £50 and £80 taken.</p>
      <p>The Royal British Legion is the country’s largest Armed Forces charity, with 235,000 members, 110,000 volunteers and a network of partners and charities.</p>
      <p>The police have been notified but won't be taking further action.</p>
