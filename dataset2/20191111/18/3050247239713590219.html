      <h1>Airbnb Now Bookable With Bitcoin and Lightning Network via Fold App</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T18:39:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 18:39</time> by <a rel="author">Helen Partz</a></address>
      <p>Bitcoin payments app Fold now supports home-sharing giant Airbnb, the firm <a href="https://twitter.com/fold_app/status/1193925648344944640">announced</a> on Nov. 11. Now Fold users can get 3% back in Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) on every stay and experience booked on Airbnb.</p>
      <h3>$25 and $100 Airbnb gift cards for Bitcoin</h3>
      <p>Airbnb is now <a href="https://use.foldapp.com/buy-cards">listed</a> on its rewards program called Fold Kickbacks. The program supports Bitcoin’s second layer Lightning Network (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/lightning-network-101/what-is-lightning-network-and-how-it-works">LN</a>) allowing to buy gift cards for Bitcoin with 3% cashback. Currently, Fold offers $25 or $100 gift cards on its website.</p>
      <p><a href="https://medium.com/in-the-fold/introducing-fold-kickbacks-5b1d255621b3">Launched</a> in July 2019, the Fold Kickbacks program already <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-startup-brings-lightning-network-payments-to-amazon-whole-foods">supports</a> some big-name retailers including Amazon, Starbucks and Uber. However, the app works in selected countries including the United States, Australia, Canada, Ireland, Mexico and the United Kingdom, depending on the specific brand. The firm expects to roll out services in Europe in the near future.</p>
      <p>In late September 2019, Fold <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/fold-app-raises-25m-to-bring-bitcoin-lightning-payments-to-starbucks">raised</a> $2.5 million in order to expand its platform with a fiat currency payment option. The new feature was added in late September 2019 and allows Fold users to spend both fiat currency and Bitcoin at online and in-store retailers by adding their credit card or Bitcoin Lightning wallet. To date, Fold app only accepts Bitcoin, the firm <a href="https://support.foldapp.com/hc/en-us/sections/360002063192-FAQ">says</a>.</p>
      <h3>More and more ways to “stack sats”</h3>
      <p>But while Fold is one of the oldest Bitcoin shopping rewards apps today first launched in 2014, it is certainly not the only one as many other options to “stack sats” are becoming available.</p>
      <p>Lolli, another Bitcoin rewards shopping app, previously <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-rewards-app-lolli-partners-with-major-us-pet-store-chain">partnered</a> with American pet retailer Petco in late August. Lolli also <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/safeway-shoppers-can-now-get-bitcoin-back-as-change-at-894-us-stores?utm_source=Telegram&amp;utm_medium=social">rolled out</a> support for major American grocery chain Safeway to provide customers with 3.5% cashback in Bitcoin on all their purchases. </p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Japan’s largest gift card platform Amaten <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/japans-largest-gift-card-marketplace-launching-blockchain-gift-cards">announced</a> its plans earlier this year to issue tokenized gift cards in partnership with blockchain network provider Aelf.</p>
