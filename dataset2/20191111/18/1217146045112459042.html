      <p>A new bug in Windows 10 1903 is causing USB drives to use the wrong icon in File Explorer even though the drives are clearly being detected properly.</p>
      <p>In the current version of Windows 10 1903 installed, when you insert a USB thumb drive into your computer, Windows will at first display the normal storage device icon for it.</p>

      <p>After a few minutes, the drive's icon in File Explorer will change and begin to incorrectly use a generic storage icon as shown below.</p>

      <p>While the icon has changed, Windows 10 is still detecting the device properly as both a storage device and a portable device.</p>

      <p>This new Windows 10 issue was <a href="https://borncity.com/win/2019/11/11/windows-10-v1903-shows-suddenly-generic-usb-drive-icons/">first reported</a> by Günter Born of BornCity.com after a reader posted a comment to his blog. It was soon discovered that users have also reported this issue in the Microsoft Answers Community [<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/weird-cpu-like-looking-icon-on-windows-10-on-my/a58ddbd5-9e47-4bd1-911f-f36fc38f2903">1</a>. <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/my-usb-drives-shows-either-as-a-generic-device-or/6e817b6d-8698-49d5-aa43-7e8a2042e47b">2</a>] and on Reddit [<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/dt34zw/the_icon_that_displays_in_explorer_for_flash/">1,</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/dt5g2q/usb_flash_drive_icon_incorrect/">2</a>].</p>
      <p>As can be seen from the images above, BleepingComputer has confirmed the issue as well.</p>
      <p>It is not known when this issue started happening, but most users have started reporting this over the past 4-5 days.</p>
      <p>The computer BleepingComputer performed this test on is using the latest Windows 10 KB4522355 cumulative update, which brings Windows 10 to build 18362.449.</p>
      <p><b>Update 11/11/19 5:31 PM EST: </b>It turns out that this issue is happening when the feature to download metadata and custom icons for installed devices is enabled in the "Device installation settings".</p>

      <p>Microsoft must have recently made a server change on their end that replaced the icon that is downloaded for USB drives.</p>
      <p>If you like the old icon, unfortunately once the new icon is downloaded due to the above setting, disabling the setting will not change the icon back. </p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/SeriouslySenpai">Seriously Senpai</a> told us on Twitter that you may be able to fix this by going into the %PROGRAMDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\DeviceMetadataCache\dmrccache folder and then into the most recently modified language folder.</p>
      <p>Then sort those folders by date to find the one for your metadata cache for the device that recently changed and delete that particular folder.</p>
      <p>You can determine the folder by going into it and seeing if the icon matches the one that you are now seeing. Then delete that folder.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, in our case this did not revert the icon back to the original storage icon.</p>
