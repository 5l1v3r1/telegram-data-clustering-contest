      <h1>Food Empire profit up 34.4% to US$7.9 million in Q3</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T18:41:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 18:41</time> by <a rel="author">Marissa Lee</a></address>
      <p>FOOD Empire, which manufactures instant coffee and snacks, has posted a net profit of US$7.9 million in the third quarter, up 34.4 per cent from the same period a year earlier on sales growth in Russia, Ukraine and IndoChina.</p>
      <p>Revenue in the three months ended Sept 30 rose 5.4 per cent to US$76.8 million, partially offset by lower contributions from the rationalisation of underperforming businesses.</p>
      <p>Executive chairman Tan Wang Cheow said in the results filing on Monday: “We remain on track to implement our multi-year plan to strengthen the group by focusing on sustainable growth through organic initiatives and pursuing M&amp;A (merger and acquisition) opportunities. Meanwhile we are continuing efforts to rationalise our underperforming businesses, streamline operations and consolidate our group structure."</p>
      <p>The group expects business to "remain resilient" even as the global economy is projected to grow at a slower pace for the remaining part of 2019 as a result of continuing trade tensions between the US and China. </p>
      <p>However, the group may face currency volatility in core markets such as Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) countries, which could impact its future results, it said.</p>

      <p>Food Empire said the construction of its second coffee plant in India is on track and trial production is expected to commence in early 2020: "The group will focus its efforts to ensure its timely commissioning."</p>
      <p>Third-quarter earnings per share was 1.47 US cents, up from 1.10 US cents in the third quarter last year.</p>
      <p>Net asset value per share was 37.22 US cents, up from 33 US cents as at Dec 31 last year.</p>
      <p>Food Empire shares closed flat at S$0.54 on Monday before results were released after market close.</p>
