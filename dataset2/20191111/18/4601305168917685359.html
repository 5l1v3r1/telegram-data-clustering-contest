      <p>Myanmar is being sued the by 57-nation Organisation of Islamic Cooperation at the UN's International Court of Justice for allegedly conducting genocide against the Rohingya minority, reports <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/57-countries-sue-myanmar-reported-genocide-rohingya-historic/story?id=66893262&amp;cid=social_fb_abcn&amp;fbclid=IwAR2THTe9HvyGCdKDKaLpTza26TUZsBN8hhSxQKXVJu6GDKgwTWhtJpcBaP0&amp;ref=hvper.com&amp;utm_source=hvper.com&amp;utm_medium=website">ABC News</a>. The <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/factsheet-november-2019-qa-gambia-v-myanmar-rohingya-genocide-international-court">lawsuit</a>, filed by Gambia, alleges that:</p>
      <blockquote>Starting in October 2016 and then again in August 2017, Myanmar’s security forces engaged in so-called “clearance operations” against the Rohingya, a distinct Muslim ethnic minority, in Rakhine State, Myanmar. The operations, in particular those that started in August 2017, were characterized by brutal violence and serious human rights violations on a mass scale. Survivors report indiscriminate killings, rape and sexual violence, arbitrary detention, torture, beatings, and forced displacement. Reports have also shown that security forces were systematically planning for such an operation against the Rohingya even before the purported reason for the violence — retaliation for small scale attacks committed by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) — occurred. As a result, an estimated 745,000 people — mostly ethnic Rohingya — were forced to flee to Bangladesh.</blockquote>
