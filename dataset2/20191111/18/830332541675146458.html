      <p>MADISON, Wis. - Gov. Tony Evers' refusal to turn over emails requested by a Milwaukee television station is drawing criticism from open government advocates who say he is interpreting the law too narrowly.</p>
      <p>WITI-TV reports that it made a request under the state's open records law for just over four weeks of emails between Evers and his chief of staff. When Evers' assistant legal counsel Erin Deeley denied the request, the TV station narrowed it to one week. When that was rejected, it narrowed the request to just one day.</p>
      <p>Deeley told the station that requests for all emails over a specific time frame, no matter how short, will be denied.</p>
      <p>Evers walked by reporters Monday following a Veterans Day celebration without taking questions.</p>
      <p>Wisconsin Freedom of Information Council President Bill Lueders says he doesn't think denial of the records question in this case is a legal interpretation of the law.</p>
