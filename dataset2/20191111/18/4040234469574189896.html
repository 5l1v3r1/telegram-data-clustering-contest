      <p>The billion-dollar deals are still going.</p>
      <p>OpenText, a Canadian software and technology service company, announced Monday its agreed to spend $1.42 billion to acquire the cloud security vendor Carbonite. The $1.42 billion values Carbonite at a price of $23 per share, a 25% premium to the price at the close of market on Nov. 8.</p>
      <p>The deal follows Carbonite’s February <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/carbonite-webroot-acquisition/">acquisition of Webroot</a> for $618.5 million in cash, and comes amid tech giants’ ongoing <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/tag/mergers-and-acquisitions/">shopping spree</a> for known security vendors.</p>
      <p>OpenText CEO Mark Barrenechea said in a statement the deal improves his company’s ability to sell to some 300,000 small businesses and 7 million individuals. The Ontario-based company expects “significant expansion of cloud revenues…and cash flows in fiscal 2021.”</p>
      <p>Carbonite has been the subject of numerous merger and acquisition rumors in recent months since reporting a dip in revenue. Mohamad Ali, the company’s former CEO, stepped down in July and was replaced by board chair Steve Munford on an interim basis. Carbonite reported a net loss of $14 million in its <a href="https://investor.carbonite.com/news-releases/news-release-details/carbonite-be-acquired-opentext-2300">third-quarter financial report</a>, a steep decline from the $600,000 in net income it reported over the same period last year.</p>
      <p>Private equity firms including KKR and Vector Capital were among the firms rumored to be exploring a deal.</p>
      <p>The OpenText deal represents a 78% premium on Carbonite’s Sept. 5 closing price, when reports first emerged a sale might be in the works.</p>
      <p>Word of the acquisition follows two unrelated deals announced last week: Proofpoint’s $225 million acquisition of ObserveIT, an insider threat company, and Sumo Logic’s purchase of the analytics provider Jask for an undisclosed sum.</p>
      <p>Before that, the private equity firm Thoma Bravo <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/sophos-thoma-bravo-acquisition/">said it would</a> acquire Sophos for $3.8 billion.</p>
      <p>As of August, <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/cybersecurity-market-size-palo-alto-symantec-cisco/">more than</a> 80 mergers or acquisitions involving cybersecurity companies had gone down this year.</p>
