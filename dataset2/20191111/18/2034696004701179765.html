      </ul>
      <p>Foals and Local Natives will co-headline a slew of dates beginning on May 20 at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles, which are preceded by two standalone Foals headline shows.</p>
      <p>The dates come on the back of Foals’ new album ‘Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost – Part Two’, which <i>NME</i> described as “a blockbuster sequel” in <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/foals-everything-not-saved-will-lost-part-2-review">a five-star album review</a>.</p>

      <p>The gigs will follow <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/foals-tease-2020-uk-tour-dates-2553601">a huge run of UK arena shows for Foals across next summer</a>, which come with support from <a href="http://nme.com/artists/everything-everything">Everything Everything</a> and <a href="http://nme.com/artists/battles">Battles</a>.</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.nme.com/foals-interview-everything-not-saved-will-be-lost-part-2-2019">a recent <i>NME</i> Big Read interview</a>, Foals spoke about the end of the decade, and how the 2010s have mostly sprung “disappointing surprises”.</p>
      <p>[It’s been] a decade of regression, probably,” Yannis Philippakis reflects. “I don’t think anyone in 2010 saw any of this coming. You couldn’t have foreseen Trump, you couldn’t have foreseen Brexit.</p>
      <p>“Even though climate issues were definitely on a lot of people’s minds, the rapidity at which it’s become a problem that needs solving couldn’t have been foreseen.”</p>
