      <h1>Singles' Day sales: US$1 billion in 67 seconds and other numbers to know</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T18:12:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 18:12</time> by <a rel="author">Solarina Ho , CTVNews.ca Writer</a></address>
      <p>Singles' Day in the world’s most populous country has become a mammoth marketing event for China's e-commerce businesses that have turned it into the world’s biggest online shopping extravaganza.</p>
      <p>Singles' Day, which originated on university campuses in Nanjing, China in the 1990s, became an annual shopping bonanza after Alibaba, China’s biggest e-commerce retailer, made it into an event a decade ago.</p>
      <p>This year's sales surpassed last year’s record, with two of the country's largest online retailers reporting combined sales of more than US$63 billion, even before final numbers were reported. The eye-popping figures make Black Friday and Cyber Monday in the U.S. seem somewhat anemic and humdrum by comparison. Alibaba posted <a href="https://www.alizila.com/live-updates-from-2019s-11-11-global-shopping-festival/">live updates</a> on its website and on <a href="https://twitter.com/AlibabaGroup">Twitter</a>, but for the very keen, the company also provided a <a href="https://www.alizila.com/2019-11-11-global-shopping-festival/">real-time sales counter</a>.</p>

      <p>Singles' Day by the numbers:</p>
      <p>1. Singles' Day takes place on November 11, because the number one and the date, 11/11, looks like a single person.</p>
      <p>2. Alibaba said sales by merchants on its platforms <a href="https://www.alizila.com/2019-11-11-global-shopping-festival/">totalled 268.44 billion yuan</a> (US$38.38 billion) by midnight local time, handily surpassing last year's total of US$30.8 billion.</p>
      <p>3. Alibaba said <a href="https://twitter.com/AlibabaGroup/status/1193850850243825664">the number of delivery orders</a> exceeded 1.042 billion in 18 hours and 31 minutes; surpassing the 2018 total.</p>
      <p>4. <a href="https://twitter.com/AlibabaGroup/status/1193560747218886656">Alibaba said sales exceeded</a> US$1 billion just 1 minute and 7 seconds after midnight on November 11, and <a href="https://twitter.com/AlibabaGroup/status/1193567174343806976">surpassed US$10 billion</a> after 29 minutes and 45 seconds.</p>
      <p>5. In the U.S. in 2018, Black Friday brought in US$6.2 billion last year, and US$7.9 billion on Cyber Monday, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181126005829/en/Adobe-Analytics-Data-Shows-Cyber-Monday-Broke">according to Adobe Analytics</a>.</p>
      <p>6. Alibaba rival, JD.com, reported sales of 179.4 billion yuan ($25.6 billion) by mid-afternoon, according to The Associated Press.</p>
      <p>7. More than <a href="https://www.alibabagroup.com/en/news/article?news=p191111">200,000 brands</a> from over 200 countries and regions were expected to participate in this year's event; <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-11/11/c_138546865.htm">only 27 brands participated</a> in 2009.</p>
      <p>8. A once-informal day, a countdown gala leading up to Singles' Day that included a performance from Taylor Swift was broadcast on nearly 30 online streaming platforms and TV channels.</p>
