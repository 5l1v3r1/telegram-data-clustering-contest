      <h1>SpaceX launches dozens more mini-satellites for global internet project</h1>

      <p>SpaceX has launched 60 mini-satellites, the second batch of an orbiting network meant to provide global internet coverage.</p>
      <p>The Falcon rocket blasted into the morning sky over Florida, marking the unprecedented fourth flight of a booster for SpaceX.</p>
      <p>The compact flat-panel satellites – just 575lbs each – will join 60 launched in May.</p>
      <p>SpaceX founder and chief executive Elon Musk wants to put thousands of these Starlink satellites in orbit, to offer high-speed internet service everywhere.</p>

      <p>He plans to start the service next year in the northern US and Canada, with global coverage for populated areas after 24 launches.</p>
      <p>Last month, Musk used an orbiting Starlink satellite to send a tweet: “Whoa, it worked!!”</p>
      <p>Employees gathered at company bases on both coasts cheered when the first-stage booster landed on a floating platform in the Atlantic.</p>
      <p>“These boosters are designed to be used 10 times. Let’s turn it around for a fifth, guys,” said the company’s launch commentator.</p>

      <p>This also marked the first time SpaceX used a previously flown nose cone. The California-based company reuses rocket parts to cut costs.</p>
      <p>Each satellite has an autonomous system for dodging space junk. In September, however, the European Space Agency had to move one of its satellites out of the way of a Starlink satellite. SpaceX later said it corrected the problem.</p>
      <p>SpaceX is among several companies interested in providing broadband internet coverage worldwide, especially in areas where it costs too much or is unreliable. Others include OneWeb and Jeff Bezos’ Amazon.</p>
