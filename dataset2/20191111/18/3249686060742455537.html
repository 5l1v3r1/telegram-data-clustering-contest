      <p><b>Ladies' Code's</b> <b>Sojung</b> revealed her thoughts on members <b>EunB</b> and<b> Rise</b> who tragically passed away in a car accident a few years ago. </p>
      <p>Sojung appeared on the November 11 broadcast of Channel A's<b> 'Eye Contact' </b>where she revealed thoughts that she previously wasn't able to talk about before. </p>
      <p>She stated that after the car accident that took the lives of her two fellow members on her birthday, her birthday doesn't seem like her birthday anymore. She continued stating: <i>"This isn't a day where people congratulate me. I went to visit my unni's and to have a birthday party later on that same day seems weird. Afterwards was hard. It was hard to do anything and I thought that I shouldn't do anything. My birthday is a sad day. " </i><br/><br/>She continued, stating: "<i>At first, it didn't seem real. It just seemed like they were away on a long vacation to somewhere far away. We had a hard time. They appeared in the other member's dreams but not mine. I think it was because I couldn't accept reality.</i>" </p>
