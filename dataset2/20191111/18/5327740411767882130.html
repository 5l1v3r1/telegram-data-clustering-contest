      <h2>That’s five days after Justin Trudeau is scheduled to swear in a new cabinet</h2>

      <p>Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer is calling on the prime minister to open Parliament on Nov. 25.</p>
      <p>That’s five days after Justin Trudeau is scheduled to swear in a new cabinet following last month’s election.</p>
      <p>Scheer’s spokesman Simon Jefferies says the country is more divided than ever and Trudeau needs to bring the House of Commons back immediately to address urgent issues.</p>
      <p>Asking for that to happen on Nov. 25 will be one of the Opposition leader’s requests of Trudeau when the two meet on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Jefferies says Scheer will also outline specific items Conservatives want to see in the throne speech, saying they’ll be based on the party’s own priorities for the next Parliament.</p>
      <p>The Liberals won 157 seats in last month’s vote, forming a minority government, with the Conservatives in second place with 121 MPs.</p>
