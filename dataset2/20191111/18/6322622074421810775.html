      <p>SEPANG: Effective Monday (Nov 11), AirAsia has ceased the sale of duty free cigarettes onboard, as well as on its website, said AirAsia Group chief executive officer Tony Fernandes.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the launch of AirAsia No Smoking and Dengue Awareness Campaign at RedQ here on Monday, he said the airline has implemented a company wide smoke- and vape-free environment at 120 offices and stations across Asia Pacific while RedQ, the airline's headquarters, is now a 100% smoke-free building.</p>
      <p>Speaking in a media conference later, Fernandes said tobacco sales generated RM9 million in revenue to AirAsia group annually.</p>
      <p>“AirAsia is also looking at stopping the sales of other products such as alcohol. It is going to be a bit tricky, but we are not rushing it. There is no time frame for that,” he said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr Dzulkefly Ahmad said AirAsia becomes the first airline in the country to implement such policies.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the event, he said the ministry will present the Blue Ribbon Campaign's Outstanding Achievement Award to Fernandes for his AirAsia's anti-smoking campaign during the Blue Ribbon Campaign awards presentation ceremony on Nov 22.</p>
      <p>According to Dr Dzulkefly, some 23% of Malaysians are smokers and about 20,000 deaths due to smoking-related diseases are recorded annually. <i>— Bernama</i></p>
