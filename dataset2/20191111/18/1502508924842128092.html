      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/wework">WeWork </a>is in talks with <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/t-mobile">T-Mobile </a>US Inc Chief Executive Officer John Legere to take over as the head of the office-sharing start-up, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.</p>
      <p>The talks come weeks after SoftBank Group spent more than $10 billion to take over WeWork, including a $1.7 billion payoff to its co-founder Adam Neumann to relinquish control.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/wework">WeWork </a>did not immediately respond to Reutersâ€™ request for comment.</p>
      <p>SoftBank Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure became the executive chairman of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/wework">WeWork </a>parent The We Company, following its bailout by the Japanese firm.</p>
      <p>Artie Minson, chief financial officer, and Sebastian Gunningham, vice chairman, currently serve as the co-chief executives of The We Company.</p>
      <p>SoftBank owns 80 per cent of the troubled office-sharing startup, but has not consolidated the company on its books because it will not hold a majority of voting rights.</p>
      <p>SoftBank has four board seats on the company's expanded 10-member board. The startup is looking for a new leader who could join as soon as January, the WSJ report said.</p>
