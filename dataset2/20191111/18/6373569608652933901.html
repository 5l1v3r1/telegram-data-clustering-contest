      <p>Viewers have been left outraged by The Chase replacement Cash Trapped.</p>
      <p>Whilst Bradley Walsh is still the host of the <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/itvs-chase-been-forced-air-3526558">substitute game show</a>, fans say their 'evening is ruined' and many have begged for ITV producers to bring back the tea-time TV favourite.</p>
      <p>Cash Trapped has been brought back after being last aired in 2017 and people have said they do not understand the concept of the show.</p>
      <p>The programme sees six contestants go head to head by answering various questions in four different rounds until one of them "escapes" during the final stage.</p>
      <p>One woman asked ITV producers if they were "crazy" for replacing The Chase.</p>
      <p>Lucy tweeted: "Are you guys crazy? What is this total s**** on my screen instead of <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23thechase">#TheChase</a></p>
      <p>"Why do you people always scrap your best shows for utter rubbish? I honestly don’t get it? Cash trapped? Crap trapped more like.</p>
      <p>"Bring back the chase!! I’m switching over."</p>

      <p>One woman said: "I'm so glad <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CashTrapped">#CashTrapped</a> is back it is great, I like answering the questions."</p>
      <p>Another added: "So glad Cash Trapped is back on TV instead of the chase for a while. Love The Chase but it’s good to see ITV freshening it up instead of the same game show every single day."</p>
      <p>Earlier today, it was revealed that a brand new Chaser had been welcomed to the team for the new series returning next year.</p>
      <p>While it's not clear when The Chase will be back, fan favourite chaser Anne Hegerty soothed fans' worries by confirming on Twitter that the hit show would be back for two Christmas specials.</p>
      <p>The Governess wrote: "CT is only on for five weeks, and this year we have TWO Christmas specials for you!!"</p>
