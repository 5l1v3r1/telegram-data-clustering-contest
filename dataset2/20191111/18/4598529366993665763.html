      <p>Attorney Robert Luskin contradicted Trump’s tweet<a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/after-baseless-trump-claim-about-transcripts-sondland-lawyer-says-his-clients-is-fine"> to the Daily Beast.</a></p>
      <p>“No reason to believe that the transcript was altered, and the clarification was released in the form that it was submitted,” he said.</p>
      <p>Sondland added to his testimony weeks after the fact to say that he’d long suspected that President Donald Trump had ordered military aid be withheld from Ukraine to force a scandal be manufactured about the Bidens.</p>
      <p>He <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/sondland-impeachment-testimony-update">said</a> that the testimonies of Ukraine diplomat Bill Taylor and outgoing National Security Council official Tim Morrison “refreshed his recollection.”</p>
