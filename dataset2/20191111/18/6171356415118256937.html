      <h1>Ring Alarm home security kit on sale for $139 ($60 off)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T18:02:35+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 18:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/ryan-whitwam/" target="_blank">Ryan Whitwam</a></address>
      <p>Setting up a home security system is easier than it used to be thanks to wireless technologies and compact, inexpensive sensors. Ring's home security kit is already a good value at $199, but it's on sale today for $60 off over at B&amp;H. It's a good addition for homes with Ring security cameras, but it works fine even if you don't want video monitoring.</p>
      <p>The 5-piece Ring Alarm kit comes with a base station/siren, a keypad, a contact sensor, a motion sensor, and a Z-wave range extender to make sure all your devices remain connected. It connects to the Ring app for remote access and monitoring, but you can also get professional monitoring for $10 per month.</p>

      <p>The B&amp;H deal is currently lower than other retailersâ€”Ring's own store and the Amazon listing are both still showing $199. If the 5-piece kit isn't quite enough coverage, you can grab a few more sensors and still come out ahead.</p>
