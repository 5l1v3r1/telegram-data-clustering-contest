      <h1>Facebook, YouTube censor mentions of ‘whistleblower’ in Trump-Ukraine scandal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T18:38:28+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 18:38</time> by <a rel="author">Jon Levine</a></address>
      <p>Social media companies are removing any mentions of the whistleblower in the Trump-Ukraine scandal, according to a report.</p>
      <p>Though the whistleblower’s name has been percolating online — including in the widely-read Drudge Report — Facebook said publishing the name on its platform violated their “coordinating harm policy,” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/11/08/facebook-youtube-move-block-spread-supposed-whistleblowers-name-twitter-permits-both-name-photos/">The Washington Post reported</a>. YouTube was also taking similar steps.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, Twitter was the only major social network to resist the change, with users still free to publish the name of the alleged whistleblower.</p>
      <p>Tweets from big-name conservative Twitter users like Candace Owens and Donald Trump, Jr. revealing the name <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/06/donald-trump-jr-tweets-possible-identity-of-white-house-whistleblower/">have gone viral in recent days.</a></p>
      <p>“Per our private information policy, any tweets that include personally identifiable information about any individual, including the alleged whistleblower, would be in violation of the Twitter Rules,” The Post reported.</p>
