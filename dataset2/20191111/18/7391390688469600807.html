      <p>When the series finale of <i>Gossip Girl</i> aired in 2012, fans were shocked, amused, and disappointed all at once as they found out the true identity of New York's all-knowing blogger was "lonely boy" Dan Humphrey. It was a puzzling revelation for many fans, but it actually wasn't the original plan. Fan favorite character <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/shylawatson/gossip-girl-actually-nate-not-dan">Nate Archibald was originally supposed to be Gossip Girl,</a> as writer and executive producer Joshua Safran revealed in a new interview on Sunday, Nov. 10.</p>
      <p>Speaking at<b> </b>Vulture Festival over the weekend, Safran was asked the <i>GG </i>fandom's most important question: why <i>was </i>Dan Gossip Girl? As it turns out, he actually doesn't know, because he wasn't a part of that decision. "I like to joke that Dan was Gossip Girl because I had left the show by then," he said, per BuzzFeed. "Dan was not <i><i>my</i></i> intended Gossip Girl, so honestly, you'd have to ask someone else."</p>
      <p>Although he said that he understood why Dan ended up being Gossip Girl, Safran had his "heart set" on Nate being the elusive blogger, which was the plan for a while. "One of the writers realized that Nate had never sent a tip in to Gossip Girl, which is true at least through the end of Season 5," he explained. "Nate never sent a tip in through all of those episodes, which is when we're like, 'Oh, well then he's Gossip Girl.'"</p>

      <p>Safran previously hinted at <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/09/gossip-girl-creators-what-never-made-it-to-air.html">Nate being a candidate for Gossip Girl</a> in a <i>Vulture </i>interview back in 2017, but this is the first time it's been confirmed that Nate <i>was </i>Gossip Girl before plans changed. As fans may recall, after becoming the editor-in-chief of the <i>Spectator </i>during Season 5, Nate not only started to send in the occasional tip to Gossip Girl when needed, he established a direct line of communication with the blogger, evidently shutting down the possibility that it was actually him.</p>
      <p>The <i>true</i> original<i> </i>plan was for Eric van der Woodsen, Serena's little bro, to be revealed as Gossip Girl, but<b> </b>the writers ditched the plotline after a leaked story spoiled the fun for everyone. "We worked hard to kind of lay in tiny seeds about it being Eric," Safran said at Vulture Fest. "Then the<i> NY Post</i> wrote an article saying that Gossip Girl was Eric so we were like, 'We gotta scratch that.'"</p>

      <p>During his talk<b>, </b>Safran also dished on the upcoming <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/the-gossip-girl-reboot-will-be-a-continuation-of-the-series-according-to-executive-producer-josh-schwartz-18362732"><i>Gossip Girl </i>reboot</a> for HBO Max. Confirming that the show would focus on a new generation of students at the Constance Billard School for Girls, the producer revealed that there will be much more <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/gossip-girl-reboot-producer-promises-more-diverse-leads.html">diversity on the reboot</a>, to more accurately reflect the lives of New York City teenagers, including non-white lead characters and "a lot of queer content."</p>
      <p>“There was not a lot of representation the first time around on the show,” he admitted. “I was the only gay writer I think the entire time I was there. Even when I went to private school in New York in the ’90s, the school didn’t necessarily reflect what was on <i>Gossip Girl</i>." He also confirmed that there<b> </b>would be an important twist in the new series, but of course, he couldn't reveal what it was.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, fans will have to wait a while before finding out what, exactly, this new diverse <i>Gossip Girl</i> will look like, given that the reboot won't premiere until sometime in 2020. In fact, news about the <i>Gossip Girl</i> reboot might end up being just as elusive as Gossip Girl herself.</p>
