      <h1>Furious The Chase fans fume 'evening is ruined' after quiz show is replaced by rival</h1>
      <h2>Fans were not happy when they tuned into ITV at 5pm for The Chase - but saw that another Bradley Walsh programme was on instead</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T18:42:27+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 18:42</time> by <a rel="author">Rose Hill, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rose-hill/</a></address>
      <p>The Chase viewers were left raging after discovering their beloved quiz show was replaced by a rival programme.</p>
      <p>Tonight, fans tuned in at 5pm - only to be bitterly disappointed after finding out that it wasn't on.</p>
      <p>Instead, host Bradley Walsh was fronting new series Cash Trapped, which sees six contestants compete to win big money.</p>
      <p>The aim of the game is to become the person who accumulates the most and has the chance to take the money and run.</p>
      <p>But if they manage to succeed, the rest of the contestants leave empty-handed, meaning that everyone else needs to try and stop them.</p>

      <p>However viewers were not happy about the change in schedule and flocked to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> to voice their dismay.</p>
      <p>One raged: "Been buzzing to get home at 5 all day to watch #TheChase but Iâ€™m seeing some s*** show called Cash Trapped is on instead #CashTrapped."</p>
      <p>While another fumed: "What in the name of f*** is this nonsense #CashTrapped and when will the #thechase be back??"</p>
      <p>A third remarked: "#TheChase that's 5pm-6pm left wide open and you you think I'm watching cash strapped think again.. COMEDY CENTRAL FRIENDS it is then."</p>
      <p>"Wot the actual f***?? Ruined my dinner time viewing where the hell is the chase at??? #thechase #bringbackthechase," another wrote.</p>
      <p>Another raged: "What on EARTH gave @ITV the impression that it was OKAY to take #TheChase off air?! The bloody cheek of it!!"</p>
      <p>
        <b>*The Chase usually airs weekdays at 5pm on ITV</b>
