      <p>The wall was reportedly undergoing work to remove ivy in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>A police dog team has been brought in to help assess the integrity of the structure.</p>
      <p>The large emergency response is made up teams from three counties, including specialist search and rescue teams trained to work in earthquake scenarios.</p>
      <p>A fire service spokesman said: “Residents are being asked to avoid the area, as there are expected to be a high number of emergency appliances involved in this multi-agency search and rescue operation.</p>
      <p>“Firefighters are working alongside other emergency services to check the area to ensure that no one needs rescuing.”</p>
