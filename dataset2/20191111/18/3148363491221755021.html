      <h1>Meghan McCain: Nikki Haley Is Making a 'Play' to Replace Pence as Vice President | Breitbart</h1>

      <p>On Monday’s broadcast of ABC’s “The View,” co-host Meghan McCain said former Trump administration U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley’s praise of President Donald Trump in her new book “With All Due Respect” and <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2019/11/10/nikki-haley-tillerson-kelly-tried-to-recruit-me-to-save-the-country-by-undermining-trump/">interviews</a> was a “play” to replace Vice President Mike Pence on the Republican 2020 ticket.</p>
      <p>McCain said, “There have been rampant rumors on Capitol Hill that she’s vying for VP. I never believed that because it seemed a little ridiculous, especially since she quit the administration and she has tweeted some things that have been against the president. I have a whole new view on this now because this looks like somebody who is very interested in having a good relationship with the administration.”</p>
      <p>She continued, “I think this is a VP play. Just going to say it. Maybe it’s uncomfortable just between us here in the room and the million people watching.”</p>
      <p>She added, “It’s very shrewd.”</p>
