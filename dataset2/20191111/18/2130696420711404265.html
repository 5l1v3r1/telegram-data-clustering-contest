      <p>TECHNICAL testing and vehicle inspection group Vicom has posted a net profit of S$7.2 million in the third quarter, up 6.5 per cent from the same period a year earlier.</p>
      <p>Revenue in the three months ended Sept 30 was S$26.4 million, up 4.7 per cent from the same period a year earlier on higher business volumes.</p>
      <p>Vicom, which is a unit of ComfortDelGro, said on Monday that demand for vehicle inspection is expected to remain strong: "The Land Transport Authority announced in October that there would be a 1.7 per cent quarter-on-quarter reduction in the quota for Certificates of Entitlement for three months starting November 2019, due to a slowdown in the deregistration of older cars. With more older cars on the road, the demand for vehicle inspection is expected to remain strong."</p>
      <p>However, the non-vehicle testing business is expected to remain "challenging" against a backdrop of global economic uncertainties, Vicom said.</p>
      <p>Third-quarter earnings per share was 8.07 Singapore cents, up from 7.58 Singapore cents in the third quarter last year.</p>

      <p>Vicom shares rose one Singapore cent or 0.13 per cent to S$7.64 before results were released after market close.</p>
