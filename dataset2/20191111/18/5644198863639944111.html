      <p>SINGAPORE: A jobless man was sentenced to a day's jail and fined S$1,200 on Monday (Nov 11) for stealing 12 durians over three days from a stall in Toa Payoh.</p>
      <p>Na Buck Nam, 56, pleaded guilty to two charges of theft, with a third charge taken into consideration.</p>

      <p>The court heard that Na had stolen the fruit from a durian stall at Block 186, Toa Payoh Central over three days from Jul 17 to Jul 19 last year.</p>
      <p>He first stole two durians worth S$20 at about 12.30am on the first occasion, then five durians valued at S$50, and another five durians on the third occasion.</p>
      <p>A shop assistant at the stall discovered some durians were missing while setting up shop on Jul 19, 2018.</p>
      <p>He viewed closed-circuit television footage from the stall and discovered that Na had stolen durians by sticking his hand through the canvas sheet at the stall on Jul 17.</p>
      <p>The assistant called the police saying: "My durian got stolen, require police assistance at the durian stall."</p>
      <p>Na was traced and arrested later that night near a McDonald's restaurant in Toa Payoh. He admitted to stealing durians from the stall and said he had eaten them.</p>
      <p>He also admitted to taking the other durians from the stall, which he also claimed to have eaten.</p>
      <p>The man has not made any restitution, said State Prosecuting Officer S Krishnan.</p>
      <p>For each count of theft, he could have been jailed for up to seven years and fined.</p>
