      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T18:55:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 18:55</time> by <a rel="author">Marjorie Kerr, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/marjorie-kerr/</a></address>
      <p>Teenager Mirhan Smith has been named the top apprentice in her category at the Scottish Apprenticeship Awards 2019.</p>
      <p>The talented 19-year-old from Livingston was announced as Modern Apprentice of the Year SCQF Level 5, sponsored by College Development Network.</p>
      <p>She won the award in front of over 350 apprentices, employers and training providers at the awards at the Caird Hall in Dundee by national skills agency, Skills Development Scotland.</p>
      <p>Mirhan works for social enterprise The Larder Cook School, which tries to reach people who are furthest from the jobs market.</p>
      <p>Now training to be a commis chef, Mirhan found her hospitality apprenticeship at the Larder Cook School through Skills Development Scotland and has gained experience working at the school’s café in East Calder.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Mirhan said: “I was happy with being nominated and I never thought I would win. To hear it being announced was a surprise and I am still in shock - it feels like a dream and that I am going to wake up any minute.</p>
      <p>“The best part of my apprenticeship is everyone I work with. They are just like my family. I want to say a massive thank you to my employers. I will never been able to return what they have given to me. Mirhan said: “To anyone thinking of doing an apprenticeship, I would say to go into it headfirst, they won’t regret it. When you do an apprenticeship, you get your foot in the door.</p>
      <p>“Since starting my apprenticeship, I have gone from feeling I was at ground level to the very top in terms of my mental health and my confidence. Now I can talk to anyone on the spot, without being scared or feeling like I was going to cry. It has been a life-changing experience.”</p>
      <p>Operational head chef for The Larder Café, Chris Stewart, said: “Mirhan is extremely positive and has a ‘can do’ attitude. She faces things head on and does everything 100% per cent. She is different from the very quiet person who started with us. She has increased in positivity, confidence and belief in herself since she started.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Mirhan takes on responsibilities without being asked. I see a person growing into who they should be and who they could be.”</p>
      <p>Training provider Sarah Dalrymple, of SD Consultancy, who nominated Mirhan for the awards, said: “Mirhan has a determination which sets her apart and is developing a set of skills which will stand her in good stead. She has had a lot to deal with and never fails to smile and be friendly.”</p>
      <p>Now in its 18th year, the Scottish Apprenticeship Awards bring together apprentices, employers and learning providers to celebrate the contributions apprenticeships make to the economy.</p>
      <p>Chair of Skills Development Scotland, Frank Mitchell, said: “More than ever, employers are recognising the benefits of investing in skills and apprenticeships.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“The Scottish Apprenticeship Awards show the value apprentices add to businesses and the economy.</p>
      <p>“This year’s fantastic winners and finalists show that apprenticeships provide productivity, diversity, fresh talent, and the right skills for Scotland.</p>
      <p>“Congratulations to Mirhan, who is a great example of apprenticeships unlocking potential and changing lives.”</p>
      <p>Apprentices and employers from across Scotland were applauded at the event by Deputy First Minister, John Swinney MSP, who sent a special filmed message to the finalists.</p>
      <p>Mr Swinney said: “The Scottish Apprenticeship Awards showcase the best in work-based learning and the finalists represent tens of thousands of apprentices in training throughout Scotland, each with their own story to share and to be proud of.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“I’ve been fortunate enough to meet apprentices across Scotland and I’m always greatly impressed by their dedication, commitment and enthusiasm.</p>
      <p>“That is why the Scottish Government continues to invest in the development and delivery of apprenticeships, with more opportunities available than ever before.</p>
      <p>“Apprentices have continued to make a positive difference to business and to help underpin Scotland’s economic competitiveness by providing us with the skills we need for today and tomorrow.”</p>
