      <p>With the controversy surrounding the E! People's Awards, ARMY have resolved to show their support for the boys by buying Map of The Soul: Persona.</p>
      <p>On the US Album Charts, Persona is currently at number 2 and it won't be a surprise if it reaches number one.</p>

      <p>ARMYs believe that change will come from showing people who they really support, no matter what awards they show. They realized that bashing the E! People Music Awards was not going to work so they showed something else. Unity. The #BuyPersonOnITunes has amassed almost 600k tweets and has only been growing over the day. ARMYs around the world hope to show people they will always be behind the bangtan boys no matter what.</p>
