      <p>Commemorating 101 years since the armistice that concluded the bloody trench warfare of World War I, Macron laid a garland, inspected the troops and also stopped by the nearby tomb of French wartime leader Georges Clemenceau. Also in attendance were former French Presidents Francois Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy, alongside other officials.</p>

      <p>Later Monday, Macron was set to inaugurate a monument for the hundreds of soldiers who died in foreign operations since 1963. Since the 1960s, 549 French soldiers have died in 17 theaters of conflict, including 141 in Lebanon, 129 in Chad, 85 in Afghanistan and 78 in the former Yugoslavia.</p>

      <p>Commemorations were also underway in France’s wartime ally, Britain.</p>
      <p>The Royal British Legion urged the nation to remember the 100th anniversary of the first two-minute silence observed on Armistice Day by shutting out modern technology and all distractions.</p>
      <p>A lone musician at the National Memorial Arboretum played “The Last Post,” as silence fell. People at ceremonies across the country bowed their heads in respect.</p>

      <p>The 93-year-old monarch, who served as an army mechanic during World War II, performed the wreath-laying herself for most of her 67-year reign but has cut back on her public duties.</p>
