      <p>KYLE, Texas -- A substitute teacher in Texas is accused of assault after a viral cell phone video shows her allegedly beating a high school student.<br/><br/>The community is demanding answers after the video reportedly shows the Lehman High School educator throwing punches, dragging the teen and stomping on her head.<br/><br/>The Hays County Sheriff's office identified the substitute teacher as 32-year-old Tiffani Lankford.<br/>A student in the class said Lankford became agitated at the Spanish class and eventually closed in on the victim.<br/><br/>It is unclear what led up to the attack.<br/><br/>The district said Lankford passed a background check when they hired her in August, adding "there is absolutely no excuse or circumstance that can justify what you see unfold on the video."<br/><br/>The school district said the accused teacher was fired and charged with second-degree felony aggravated assault.</p>
