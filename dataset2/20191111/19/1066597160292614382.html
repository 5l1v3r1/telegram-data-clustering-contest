      <h1>'Perfect' Remembrance Day as war medals returned to family</h1>

      <p>LONDON, Ont. -- It’s been a Remembrance Day Shawn MacNeil will not forget.</p>
      <p>His mission was to hand deliver three First World War medals to Bayfield and to the family of a soldier who served in the 1st Canadian Infantry.</p>
      <p>“It couldn’t be a more perfect Remembrance Day,” MacNeil says while driving from Corunna to Bayfield in snowy conditions to hand over the medals.</p>
      <p>“This is my mandate.”</p>
      <p>MacNeil is a Veteran Service Officer for the Royal Canadian Legion, Branch 447 in Corunna. It was at that branch that a lady dropped off a Laura Secord chocolate box that contained war memorabilia, including shoulder flashes and empty bullet cases, along with the medals.</p>
      <p>The three medals are the British Victory Medal, the Canadian Victory Medal and Great War for Civilization Medal.</p>
      <p>Each has the name Ernest Henry Bake and his service number. Bake’s attestation papers show he was 27 when he signed them on Sept. 14, 1914 in Halifax, N.S.</p>
      <p>After posting photos of the medals on Facebook, Legion members went to work sharing the post and trying to find the Bake family. A Ladies Auxiliary member did some research using her Ancestry account.</p>
      <p>About two weeks after the post, MacNeil was contacted by the Bayfield Historical Society who had two uniforms of Bake’s son Leslie Bake in their possession for a Remembrance Day display.</p>
      <p>Leslie served in World War II in France, Belgium and Holland.</p>
      <p>The granddaughter of Ernest Bake, Margaret Clydesdale, was on hand for a presentation of the medals from MacNeil Monday afternoon in Bayfield, along with members of the Bayfield Historical Society.</p>
      <p>When seeing the medals for the first time in decades, Clydesdale was choked up. "It's amazing; I'm overwhelmed."</p>
      <p>She is unsure how the medals turned up in Corunna.</p>
      <p>MacNeil, who is originally from London and is a Laurier Secondary School graduate, says it feels “extremely rewarding” to know the medals are back with the family.</p>
      <p>“Every time I think about it, even now, I still get chills up and down my spine. These medals are precious. For me as a service officer, this is very fulfilling. This is my mandate.”</p>
      <p>He is also particularly excited that the medal presentation was in front of the Remembrance Day windows at the Bayfield Historical Society and with Leslie’s uniforms on hand.</p>
      <p>“That blew my mind. When I got them (the medals), I thought, ‘If I can re-unite them on or before Remembrance Day.’ It came to fruition. It’s an absolute honour to be able to reunite them with the family.”</p>
      <p>MacNeil will also be in London on Remembrance Day to deliver a cheque from the Ladies’ Auxiliary at his branch to provide funds for veteran beds at Parkwood Institute.</p>
