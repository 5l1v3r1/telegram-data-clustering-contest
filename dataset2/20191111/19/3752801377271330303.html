      <p>Clashes erupted between Palestinians and Israeli forces on Monday during demonstrations in the occupied West Bank marking the 15th anniversary of Yasser Arafat's death, as a Palestinian was shot dead and dozens of others were injured.</p>
      <p>The UN envoy for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict said "shocking" video purportedly of the shooting by Israeli forces being shared online "would seem to indicate that he posed no threat to anyone".</p>
      <p>Demonstrations were held in Ramallah and the Hebron area of the West Bank to commemorate the legacy of Arafat, revered as a hero by Palestinians.</p>
      <p>Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas, who succeeded Arafat, laid a wreath at his tomb at a ceremony in Ramallah, where hundreds gathered with pictures and flags for the anniversary.</p>
      <p>"Israel says the martyrs are criminals, terrorists and murderers," Abbas said, referring to Palestinians killed by Israeli forces.</p>
      <p>"We will never agree to give up on our martyrs, our most sacred martyrs."</p>
      <p>Sporadic clashes erupted with Israeli forces, including in the Hebron area, where the Palestinian was shot dead, the Palestinian health ministry and medics said.</p>
      <p>Palestinian medical sources identified the man as 22-year-old Omar al-Badawi, who was hit in the chest with live fire at Al-Arroub refugee camp before being taken to hospital in Hebron where he was pronounced dead.</p>
      <p>An Israeli military spokeswoman said a large number of Palestinians threw stones and firebombs at soldiers, who responded with "riot-dispersal means and live fire".</p>
      <p>Nickolay Mladenov of the UN, however, called for an investigation and offered his condolences to Badawi's family.</p>
      <p>Palestinians pointed to purported video of the shooting being shared on social media in which Badawi appeared to be shot while not posing any immediate threat.</p>
      <p>Palestine Liberation Organisation secretary general Saeb Erekat called on the International Criminal Court to investigate the shooting, and hundreds of mourners attended Badawi's funeral.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Live fire </b>
      </p>
      <p>Medics also reported Israeli use of live fire in clashes at Fawwar, south of Hebron, one of the most tense cities in the West Bank.</p>
      <p>Palestinians threw stones at Israeli soldiers in Hebron itself and troops responded with tear gas, an AFP journalist reported.</p>
      <p>The Palestinian Red Crescent reported at least 49 injuries in total, including two from live fire.</p>
      <p>Arafat died on November 11, 2004, at a hospital near Paris from unknown causes at the age of 75.</p>
      <p>Palestinians have long accused Israel of poisoning him, charges the Israeli government firmly denies.</p>
      <p>His body was exhumed in 2012 for tests, but a subsequent French investigation found no proof of poisoning.</p>
      <p>Hamas, the Islamist leaders of the Gaza Strip, prohibited a Fatah movement event to mark the death of Arafat in the coastal Palestinian enclave.</p>
      <p>Hamas and Fatah, which Arafat led, have been deeply divided since a 2007 near civil war when Hamas overthrew Abbas's forces in the blockaded Gaza Strip.</p>
      <p><b>'Very foundation'</b> </p>
      <p>No Palestinian elections apart from local polls have been held since 2006 because of the split, but both sides have spoken of a renewed push to do so.</p>
      <p>Abbas, 84, spoke again of holding elections on Monday, saying legislative polls should be held first, followed by a presidential vote.</p>
      <p>He has insisted on holding the elections in the West Bank, in the Gaza Strip and in Jerusalem.</p>
      <p>Israel occupied the West Bank and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Six-Day War.</p>
      <p>It later annexed east Jerusalem and considers the entire city its capital, while the Palestinians view the eastern sector as the capital of their future state.</p>
      <p>Israel prevents any Palestinian Authority activity in east Jerusalem.</p>
      <p>Hamas leader Ismail Haniya on Sunday also spoke of elections, saying they were "at the very foundation of the Palestinian national project".</p>
      <p>In 2005, Abbas comfortably won presidential elections held in both the West Bank and Gaza.</p>
      <p>But a year later, Hamas shocked the world by beating Abbas's Fatah movement in parliamentary polls.</p>
      <p>Unlike Fatah, the Islamists reject all negotiations with Israel and support violent means. They have fought three wars with Israel since 2008.</p>
