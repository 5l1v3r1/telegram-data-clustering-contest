      <p>KUALA LUMPUR: The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MEA) will be conducting a feasibility study on blue economy next year.</p>
      <p>Its minister Datuk Seri Mohamed Azmin Ali said the ministry has decided to carry out an in-depth study on blue economy due to its vast potential based on the size of the Malaysian waters.</p>
      <p>“The feasibility study project involves the implementation of various new and extended feasibility studies conducted by relevant ministries and agencies to help provide input in planning the socio-economic development of the country, as well as input in the preparation of the 12MP (12th Malaysia Plan).</p>
      <p>“By 2020, there will be 10 extended studies in various stages of implementation," he said when winding up debate on the Supply Bill 2020 at the Dewan Rakyat on Monday (Nov 11).</p>
      <p>Blue economy is defined by the European Commission as all economic activities related to oceans, seas and coasts.</p>
      <p>According to the World Bank, blue economy encompasses the fisheries industry, renewable energy, maritime transportation, waste management, tourism and climate change.</p>
      <p>This is translated into the sustainable use of marine resources for economic development, while maintaining and improving ocean health.</p>
      <p>Mohamed Azmin said among the studies were that of Industry 4.0, technical and commercial direction of the KL-Singapore high-speed rail project, national padi and rice coordination, and oil and gas services equipment.</p>
      <p>As of November 2019, he said there were additional requirements for new studies to be conducted by 2020 including the blue economy and high-speed rail technical studies. <i>— Bernama</i></p>
