      <h1>Which Google Stadia launch titles will you purchase? [Poll]</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T19:23:30+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 19:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/skylled/" target="_blank">Kyle Bradshaw</a></address>
      <p>Earlier today, <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/11/stadia-launch-games/">Google confirmed</a> the 12 titles that will be available immediately when Stadia launches on November 19. Which of those games are you planning on buying?</p>
      <p>For some time now, we’ve known that Google Stadia would launch with <i>Destiny 2: The Collection</i> as its flagship launch title, as all Stadia Founders and Premiere Edition kits include it as part of their bundled Stadia Pro membership.</p>
      <p>Today, Google has confirmed the other 11 titles that will join <i>Destiny 2</i> at Stadia’s launch next week, and the list has a solid variety of game genres. From the first Stadia-exclusive title, <i>GYLT</i>, to the entire <i>Tomb Raider</i> trilogy, Google Stadia will have a little something for everyone on Day 1.</p>
      <p>Beyond my personal excitement to play <i>Destiny 2</i> again on Google Stadia, I’m very much looking forward to playing <i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i> at launch. Meanwhile, our Ben Schoon has his eyes on the <i>Tomb Raider</i> games, and Abner Li is particularly excited to play <i>Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</i> and <i>GYLT</i>.</p>
      <p>For those of you who pre-ordered the Stadia Founders Edition or Premiere Edition, and those who will be receiving a Buddy Pass from a Founder, which of Stadia’s launch titles do you plan on buying? Do we have any <i>Just Dance 2020</i> fans out there?</p>

      </p>
      <p>Luckily, even if none of the Day 1 launch titles excite you, there are plenty more fantastic games for Google Stadia on the <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/11/stadia-launch-games/">immediate horizon</a> including <i>Borderlands 3</i>, <i>Final Fantasy XV</i>, and <i>Football Manager 2020</i>. Next year looks even better for Google Stadia, with titles like <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/08/19/cyberpunk-2077-confirmed-for-google-stadia/"><i>Cyberpunk 2077</i></a> and <i>Marvel’s Avengers</i>.</p>
