      <p>Guo Minghao said that all of the improvements in the new Apple Watch are due to the use of better LCP boards. Dongshan Precision, Avary Holding and Flexium Interconnect will supply the LCP boards.</p>
      <p>With reference to Apple’s Watch upgrade, the new Apple Watch Series 6 should adopt a stronger Apple S-series chip. This chip will also bring performance improvements. As for waterproofing, users can wear them for swimming or showering. This feature has already been available since Apple Watch Series 2. However, the Apple Watch Series 6 will have better waterproof proof performance probably usable at greater water depths. It will work perfectly for diving or water skiing – these are events with stronger water pressure.</p>
      <p>The Apple Watch Series 6 will come with sleep tracking and a MicroLED display as revealed by previous speculations. Finally, this watch will arrive next year. What do you think about the Apple Watch Series 6? Are the improvements enough? Let us know your thoughts in the comments. </p>
