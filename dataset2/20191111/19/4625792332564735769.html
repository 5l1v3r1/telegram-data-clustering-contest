      <h1>'Lock him up!': Trump’s Veterans Day visit to NYC met with protests</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T19:31:59+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 19:31</time> by <a rel="author">Zachary Halaschak</a></address>
      <p>President Trump’s visit to New York City for Veterans Day was punctuated by protesters chanting “lock him up” and “traitor.”</p>
      <p>Trump <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/watch-live-trump-speaks-at-100th-annual-veterans-day-parade-in-nyc">delivered opening remarks</a> in a speech at Madison Square Park in Manhattan as part of New York’s 100th annual Veterans Day parade. He was the first sitting president to address the event and gave a speech that largely avoided politics and instead focused on American veterans and troops.</p>
      <p>Despite the nature of the event, groups of protesters congregated near where Trump was speaking to protest his presidency. The group could be heard blowing loud whistles and yelling “lock him up!”</p>

      <p>Demonstrators with windows overlooking the speech also protested by putting up signs that read “IMPEACH” and “DUMP TRUMP.”</p>

      <p>During Trump’s approximately 20-minute speech, he <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/469875-trump-nyc-veterans-day-speech-met-with-protests">praised</a> the sacrifices veterans have made throughout the country’s history.</p>
      <p>“This nation is forever in your debt, and we thank you all,” he said. “You are the reason our hearts swell with pride, our foes tremble with fear, and our nation thrives in freedom.”</p>
      <p>Trump also hailed American special operations forces who were part of the raid that <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-dead-in-syria-raid">resulted in the death</a> of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi and <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/isis-spokesman-blown-up-in-airstrike-following-baghdadi-raid">ISIS spokesman</a> Abu Hassan al Muhajir. He pointed out that the United States is working on eliminating <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/isis-confirms-death-of-baghdadi-names-new-leader">the terror group’s new leader</a>, Abu Ibrahim al Hashimi al Qurayshi.</p>
      <p>“Thanks to American warriors, al Baghdadi is dead. His second-in-charge is dead. We have our eyes on No. 3. His reign of terror is over, and our enemies are running very, very scared,” Trump said. “Those who threaten our people don’t stand a chance against the righteous might of the American military.”</p>
      <p>“The men and women who have donned our nation’s uniforms are the bravest, toughest, strongest, and most virtuous warriors ever to walk on Earth,” he added.</p>
      <p>Trump, accompanied by first lady Melania Trump, also attended a wreath-laying ceremony at the Eternal Light Monument.</p>
