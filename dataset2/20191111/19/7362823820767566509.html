      <p>Doctors at a Detroit hospital have performed a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research/transplants">double lung transplant</a> on a man whose lungs were damaged from <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/respiratory-health/stop-smoking">vaping.</a></p>
      <p>No other details of the transplant were released Monday by Henry Ford Health System, which has scheduled a news conference Tuesday. The patient has asked his medical team to share photographs and an update to warn others about vaping.</p>

      <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week announced a breakthrough into the cause of a vaping illness outbreak, identifying a chemical compound as a "very strong culprit." Vitamin E acetate previously was found in liquid from electronic cigarettes and other vaping devices used by many who got sick and only recently has been used as a vaping fluid thickener.</p>
