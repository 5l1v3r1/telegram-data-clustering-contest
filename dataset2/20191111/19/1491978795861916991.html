        <i>Three main themes stood out – better infrastructure, slowing immigration and more emphasis on the regions</i>
      </p>
      <p>As New Zealand heads towards a population of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/04/thinking-big-new-zealands-growing-pains-as-population-nears-5-million">5 million people in early 2020</a>, we asked you what you thought were the most important issues and how they should be addressed.</p>
      <p>Broadly speaking, three strong themes dominated your answers: <b>infrastructure </b>(including housing and transport), <b>slowing immigration</b> and encouraging migration to and investment in <b>regional areas</b>.</p>
      <p>Here’s a flavour of the responses:</p>
      <h3>Transport and housing</h3>
      <p>“New Zealand has major infrastructure problems – the fact that there’s now 5 million of us here doesn’t change anything (other than incrementally), but the housing supply is still grossly insufficient and in most parts of the country public transport is all but non-existent. The government has to accept that it needs to invest in a proper rail links, especially between major cities, and that it will not realise any short-term returns on that investment.” <i>Auckland resident, aged 30</i></p>

      <p>“We need better transport infrastructure, particularly within the Greater Auckland area. The extensive urban sprawl due to traditionally low-density housing in Auckland makes this a complex challenge. This is compounded by the unique geographical features of the Auckland landscape, such as the densely populated North Shore only being easily accessible from the CBD via the harbour bridge. The major public transport option in Auckland is the bus, which isn’t much fun when it takes an hour into town from the “affordable suburbs” with properties $800,000 on average, and further burdens the overstretched road network. Rush hour starts at 4pm now. It is disheartening to hear that we pay over nine times our income for housing in Auckland, according to the median multiples measure, yet we are so much further behind other cities in terms of public transport infrastructure. It is one of the many things which makes you question whether your investment in this city was worth it.” <i>Laura, 32, Auckland</i></p>
      <p>“Fix the housing crisis. Find a way to make suburban living more attractive and create opportunities and destination spaces outside the city centres.”<i> Lola Davies, 28, Wellington</i></p>
      <p>“New Zealand needs some decent public transport around its main cities. No city currently has an underground rail system (although construction has started on a relatively small one for Auckland) and the only real public transport available in Auckland currently is an inefficient bus system. Our motorways are clogged every morning and evening with car traffic – and nearly every vehicle has just one person in it. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/newzealand">New Zealand</a> needs public transport that works, and New Zealanders need to change how they commute to use it. The whole country seems to think that we’re largely blameless for climate change, but when we commute like this, paired with the intensive agriculture, we have a long way to go before we can actually claim to be faultless.” <i>Camille B, 17, North Auckland</i></p>
      <p>“Historically, New Zealand’s infrastructure has been created by the state: the railways and public health in the 19th century; state housing in the ‘30s; hydro-electricity schemes in the 1970s. In the 21st century the multiple challenges of climate, demographics and technology will require the state to once again take the lead with investment in a Green New Deal to provide public transport, solar energy, affordable housing and universal basic services. New Zealand has been a social laboratory in the past and must be once again if we are to build an inclusive, sustainable society.”<i> John Kerr, 56, Christchurch</i></p>
      <p>“We need to change our housing and transport so we can cope with an increased population. Continuing the status quo – suburban sprawl with everyone driving a car – will put our forests and waterways under continued pressure. Central and local government could begin this transition by investing in light rail, which would both take pressure off roads and encourage denser housing. Another needed development is commuter rail. This would prevent depopulation of smaller towns by allowing workers with jobs in the larger cities to live in cheaper areas, easing pressure on housing. These developments in infrastructure would not only boost the economy, but give everyone a better quality of life and more time to enjoy New Zealand’s beautiful natural setting.” <i>David Saunders, 28, Christchurch</i></p>
      <h3>Managing immigration</h3>
      <p>I think the government should restrict immigration further perhaps while increasing international aid which might go some way to compensate. I understand further restrictions on immigration may appear callous. However, in NZ there is a shortage of housing and services are strained. Allowing too much immigration also runs the risk of diminishing voting for left leaning government as has happened in Germany and other countries. <i>Christchurch resident, aged 33</i></p>

      <p>“Considering the pace of change, New Zealand’s transition to a multicultural society has been fairly painless; but I still believe immigration needs to be lowered to a more sustainable level, if only for the sake of everyone who is already here. We are woefully behind in terms of infrastructure and housing. In places such as Auckland, we are nowhere near capable of accommodating everyone. I watched housing go from fairly affordable, to completely unaffordable in a matter of six or so years. Banks are telling 35 year olds to ask their parents for money/equity – it’s truly sad! We need more incentives and schemes which encourage individuals and families to build houses; the process is daunting, but with help, many more would chose this option. In certain areas, building is more affordable than buying residential, and we desperately need that housing stock. We also need more effective policies designed to funnel immigrants into the smaller towns and provinces. But that in itself, will of course require more investment in infrastructure.”<i> Rory, 35, Auckland</i></p>

      <p>“NZ is a nation whose infrastructure has scale to support only 3.5m people. At 5m we are at breaking point. Rail networks are worse than 100 years ago. Roading is stuck in the 1960’s. Health services are massively underfunded with endless waiting lists for essential surgery. Poverty stalks the suburbs affecting nearly 50% of families. Kids go to school daily without breakfast, shoes and other basic necessities. Teachers are underpaid and live just above the poverty line just like nurses, police, and many who traditionally would have been middle class. Farmers are massively indebted due to being victims of falling global food commodity prices. Tourism supposedly offers a lifeline of foreign earnings, but at the cost of sacrificing the remaining natural environment we have. New Zealanders find it more affordable to holiday outside of NZ rather than compete with the hoards of international tourists who befoul the natural spaces in long queues to get their essential instagram shots. Meanwhile foreign billionaires quietly buy up isolated tracts of land and build bunkers to retreat to when the fall of society happens. The problem is New Zealanders are too meek to protest and stop letting this happen.”<i> Marc, 43, Richmond</i></p>
      <h3>Investing in regional areas</h3>
      <aside>We need to preserve this slice of paradise – there aren’t many left in this world!<cite>Jim Johnson</cite></aside>
      <p>“As New Zealand’s population grows, particularly in Auckland, pressure increases on regions that are only experiencing slow growth. New Zealand has an ageing population. Healthcare and aged care is a primary concern. Regions such as the Wairarapa cannot attract enough doctors. Short staffed GP practices are not accepting new patients, new residents have no GP close by, and those already on the books wait weeks to see a GP leading to the poor health outcomes the region experiences. The regional hospitals are underfunded, there are long waiting lists for many procedures, such as hip replacement, that severely restrict quality of life. New Zealand should be reducing it’s high cancer rates and poor outcomes by offering screening programmes but what is on offer has been cut back or overpromised by central Government. Australia is a far more attractive country when it comes to and better health outcomes for a range of cancers and other diseases. How long before new immigrants realise this and make the leap across the ocean, turning New Zealand into a pit stop. <br/>The regions do not have the resources to solve healthcare and housing crisis, the central government needs to invest some of the deficit. <i>Denise Williams, 54, Masterton</i></p>
      <p>“Put more emphasis on regional development. Auckland is developing at a rate which leaves the rest of the country under-catered for, and reinforces social inequality. Thus, using an immigration system which directs immigrants away from Auckland and towards the regions is a first essential. And while they are at it, providing more services which help immigrants to understand the perspectives of and to live like New Zealanders would be welcome. I know we are not a rich country, but it can’t all be left to charities and chance.” <i>Daleaway, 70+, Kapiti region</i></p>
      <p>“I think we need to focus on moving people – particularly new immigrants – to other centres. Auckland is simply too full and the infrastructure cannot handle the ever growing population. Granted, the population will continue to rise but I believe providing incentives to live in the country side or Rotorua or Christchurch or Dunedin or any smaller city will help “spread the load” of an ever growing population on our small country. Don’t get me wrong, I love and embrace our multicultural society – but I don’t want my quality of life and my way of life (that I have known for 29 years) to be jeopardised through overpopulation. We need to preserve this slice of paradise – there aren’t many left in this world!” <i>Jim Johnson, 29, Auckland</i></p>
