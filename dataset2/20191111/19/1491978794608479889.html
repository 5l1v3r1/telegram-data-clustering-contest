        <i>Shares jumped 6% after Bloomberg report that Walgreens Boots Alliance received buyout from KKR</i>
      </p>
      <p>The global drugstore chain Walgreens Boots Alliance has reportedly received a buyout offer from the private equity group KKR – if successful, the deal would be the biggest private equity transaction on record.</p>
      <p>Shares in Walgreens Boots Alliance rose 6% on Monday after <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-11/kkr-said-to-make-formal-approach-to-walgreens-on-record-buyout">Bloomberg </a>reported news of the deal. Its shares had fallen nearly 20% between January and the end of October, before news of a potential buyout emerged.</p>
      <p>Walgreens Boots Alliance, which owns Walgreens and Duane Reade in the US, Boots in the UK and a number of pharmaceutical manufacturing and distribution companies, operates in 25 countries and has more than 415,000 employees.</p>
      <p>It has struggled in recent years and is currently closing stores and cutting jobs in an attempt to save $1.8bn a year in costs by 2022. The company is facing stiff competition from online sales as consumers increasingly buy household staples online, a trend that is rapidly expanding to pharmaceuticals too. Slowing revenue from prescription drugs have also hurt the company.</p>
      <p>Last year Amazon bought the online pharmacy PillPack in a deal widely seen as an indication of Amazon’s intent to push further into the healthcare industry.</p>
      <p>Chairman Stefano Pessina, who owns about 16% of the company, built Walgreens Boots Alliance through a series of takeovers. KKR helped Pessina buy Boots Alliance in 2014 in what was Britain’s largest ever management buyout.</p>
      <p>Despite the company’s size it has struggled. The company is currently reviewing its store portfolio and in May <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/allianceboots">Boots</a> said it could <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/may/28/boots-could-close-up-to-200-stores-leading-to-hundreds-of-job-losses">close up to 200 stores</a> over the next two years, the latest in a series of high street names to announce drastic closures. In a call with analysts earlier this year the company also blamed Brexit for “challenging” conditions.</p>
      <p>In the US Walgreens’ largest rival, CVS Health, has repositioned itself as a healthcare giant, merging with the insurer Aetna. Walgreens, in contrast, attempted to expand its portfolio with an unsuccessful takeover of rival Rite Aid and has since announced a deal to expand with other retailers, including the grocery chain Kroger.</p>
      <p>With a market value of $56bn and $16.8bn in debt, the price to take the company private would top the largest leveraged buyout in history: the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/JPPV2T1A1I4I">2007 sale of utility TXU</a> to KKR and private equity investment firm TPG, which was worth about $45bn, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.</p>
      <p>Some finance chiefs are skeptical about a deal. “It might be possible. It’s a huge stretch doing things over $50bn,” Stephen Schwarzman, head of Blackstone, one of the world’s biggest buyout firms, told a Reuters Newsmaker conference last week.</p>
