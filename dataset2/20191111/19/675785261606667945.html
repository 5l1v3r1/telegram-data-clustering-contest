      <p>"They locked me up for 15 days and barely gave me any food. They burned my hands with hot oil and tied me up"</p>

      <p>She adds: "'They took me from one home to another one.</p>
      <p>"In the first home, they tortured me and hit me repeatedly and then took me to another one where I experienced the same.</p>
      <p>"I don't think I'm going to live. I think I'm going to die.</p>
      <p>"They have beaten and tortured me. Please save me, just take me away from here."</p>

      <p>The post has been shared thousands of times on social media, with many highlighting how it reveals the shameful exploitation of some Asians working abroad.</p>
      <p>A Bangladeshi Non-Government Organisation, BRAC, said she is still living with her Saudi employers in Jeddah and has had her phone confiscated.</p>
      <p>BRAC are desperately trying to bring the woman home.</p>
      <p>Her family in Bangladesh said they had been 'trying to get her back but couldn't'.</p>

      <p>Since 1991, some 300,000 Bangladeshi women have travelled to the Gulf nation to work, according to the ministry of expatriates' welfare.</p>
      <p>Many fall victim to rogue recruitment firms promising good jobs with a good wage abroad.</p>
      <p>Migrant rights group Ovibashi Karmi Unnayan Program, based in Bangladesh, said last month that 61% of 110 women they interviewed who returned home, many from Saudi Arabia, said they had been physically abused by employers.</p>
      <p>Around 14% said they were sexually abused.</p>
