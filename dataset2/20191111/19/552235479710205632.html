      <h1>Michael Stewart claims Celtic's Green Brigade 'go far too far' after offensive poppy chants</h1>
      <h2>The pundit feels that the club needs to offer stranger sanctions against their most vociferous supporters.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T19:13:56+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 19:13</time> by <a rel="author">Jonathan McFarlane</a></address>
      <p>Michael Stewart has suggested that chants emanating from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> 's Green Brigade section of "You can stick your f***ing poppy up your a***" prove that the ultras group need firmer management.</p>
      <p>While the pundit praised the noise and colour that the North Curve generates and some of their politics, he feels that Celtic Chief Executive <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/peter-lawwell">Peter Lawwell</a> needs to make some some hard decisions on their future.</p>
      <p>Large swathes of the section decided to take their seat after Saturday's minute's silence before the club's match with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/motherwell-fc">Motherwell</a> .</p>
      <p>The silence was impeccably observed by those who were in the ground for kick-off but later in the game, the group began the offensive chanting.</p>

      <p>It did not go down well with the rest of the ground who attempted to drown out the noise with a chorus of boos.</p>
      <p>And Stewart feels the debate is reflective of the societal problem of polarisation.</p>
      <p>Speaking to BBC <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0079g4q">Sportsound</a> , Stewart said: "I don't think there is any doubt that they play a big part in the atmosphere at Celtic Park but they are indicative of the way things are as a society as a whole.</p>
      <p>"It's extreme, it's polarized and I think we need to reclaim the middle ground here and that means doing what they did before the match. If you want to protest against the poppy then you stand outside and you don't have to come into the stadium and sing your songs.</p>
      <p>"That's what you do if you don't agree with poppies being in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-park">Celtic Park</a> . Stand outside and respectfully protest.</p>
      <p>"Coming inside and singing songs about sticking poppies wherever you want(is wrong). You may not agree with it but the way to go about it is doing it in a fashion that is still respectable and respectful of the people who have given their lives.</p>

      <p>"This is where you can't distinguish politics from football because they converge here. And there are Irish republicans who went and fought in the first World War. This wasn't a conflict unique to the UK, there were people from all over the world that fought for the Allied forces in WW1.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>"It's very difficult (for Peter Lawwell). But this is where leadership and tough calls come into play. I think they do have to take a firmer stance on these things.</p>
      <p>"Yes, they are undoubtedly a positive in terms of the atmosphere and politically as well, on a lot of things I would agree with a lot of the things they stand for.</p>
      <p>"But on other things they go too far. They go far too far. And there has to be repercussions to turn back and say, 'Look, this is unacceptable.'</p>
      <p>"And whether it's relocation...actually I think lines of communication needs to be opened up."</p>
