      <p>Health workers in Northern Ireland have voted for strike action.</p>
      <p>Trade union Unison said its ballot focused on pay and staffing levels.</p>
      <p>The union’s elected representatives across the health system will meet on Friday to finalise details for what it described as a “comprehensive industrial action plan”.</p>
      <p>It is expected to include strike action and other forms of industrial action across the system.</p>
      <blockquote>Health workers do not take industrial action lightly but they have been pushed to the brink</blockquote>
      <p>The first of the actions is expected to take place before the end of November.</p>
      <p>Unison regional secretary Patricia McKeown said workers feel they have been “pushed to the brink”.</p>
      <p>She said: “Health workers do not take industrial action lightly but they have been pushed to the brink.</p>
      <p>“Responsibility for averting this critical situation lies with the Department of Health, the head of the NI Civil Service and the Department of Finance.</p>
      <p>“They must access the funding necessary to resolve the pay problem and begin to address safe staffing levels as a matter of extreme urgency.</p>
      <p>“Their current proposals are rejected by us as wholly inadequate.”</p>
      <p>In a statement, the UK's Department of Health said it is currently experiencing a time of “intense budgetary pressures”.</p>
      <p>“The department remains focused on finding a way forward – in this context we are currently finalising a formal pay offer for 2019/20,” the statement said.</p>
      <blockquote>Despite claims to the contrary, there is no separate or untapped source of funding that we can access - nor can money simply be found in the budget</blockquote>
      <p>“This will be the best offer possible within the budget available, but the reality is that our ability to address pay issues is inevitably constrained at a time of intense budgetary pressures for health and social care services.</p>
      <p>“These budgetary pressures are clear for all to see, and we have been highlighting these for some considerable time.</p>
      <p>“Despite claims to the contrary, there is no separate or untapped source of funding that we can access – nor can money simply be found in the budget.</p>
      <p>“As with any other item of expenditure, pay costs come out of the one health budget, which is currently overcommitted. Every pound spent on one priority area is a pound not available for another.”</p>
      <p>The vote by Unison workers comes a week after nurses in Northern Ireland voted to strike over staffing numbers and pay disputes.</p>
