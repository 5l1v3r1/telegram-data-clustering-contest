      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T19:35:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 19:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>Aaron Connolly has been ruled out of the upcoming games against New Zealand and Denmark due to injury.</p>
      <p>The Brighton and Hove Albion teenager was officially withdrawn from Mick McCarthy’s squad this evening.</p>
      <p>The striker had a scan in England this afternoon on his injured groin which he picked up during the club's 3-1 defeat to Manchester United at Old Trafford yesterday.</p>
      <p>“Our team doctor Alan Byrne has spoken to the Brighton medical team and had a look at the scans,” McCarthy told the FAI website.</p>
      <p>“The scans have confirmed the groin injury and Aaron won’t be ready in time for New Zealand and Denmark.”</p>
      <p>The Irish boss will now work with the 27 players who reported yesterday and won’t be calling any replacements into the squad.</p>
