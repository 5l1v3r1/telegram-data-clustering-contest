      <p>COLOMBO: A senior Sri Lankan minister accused social media giant Facebook on Monday (Nov 11) of censoring comments he made questioning the citizenship of presidential election frontrunner Gotabhaya Rajapakse.</p>
      <p>The nationality of Rajapakse, brother of former strongman president Mahinda, is a key issue ahead of voting Saturday as Sri Lankan law prohibits dual citizens from holding elected office.</p>

      <p>Communications Minister Harin Fernando asked in a Facebook post on his official ministry page Sunday whether Rajapakse should be allowed to stand, suggesting he was still a US national.</p>
      <p>"Is Mr. Rajapakse legally able to contest at a Presidential election in Sri Lanka?" Fernando asked in the now-deleted post.</p>
      <p>"If elected, will he able to take oaths and discharge the duties of the office?"</p>
      <p>Gotabhaya became a US citizen in 2003, giving up his Sri Lanka passport after migrating to Los Angeles following a 20-year military career.</p>
      <p>He returned to Colombo in 2005, when he says he reclaimed Sri Lankan citizenship and was appointed defence secretary in his brother's administration.</p>
      <p>Gotabhaya insists he renounced US citizenship in May this year.</p>
      <p>Fernando said Facebook took down the post from his official ministry page on Sunday, and he repeated the allegations on Twitter while complaining he had been censored.</p>
      <p>The same post was still visible on his private Facebook page, however, including a screenshot of what he claimed was Rajapakse's US passport.</p>
      <p>"American companies shouldn't interfere on behalf of an American contesting a SL election. I stand by my every word," he tweeted.</p>
      <p>A Facebook spokesperson said they routinely took down any posts containing personal or confidential information.</p>
      <p>"We remove this content whenever we become aware of it,? the company told AFP.</p>
      <p>Last month, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said it would not censor political speech.</p>
      <p>"I don't think most people want to live in a world where you can only post things that tech companies judge to be 100 per cent true," he said.</p>
      <p>Rajapakse's nationality is also the subject of a police investigation, but the next court hearing will only be held after the election.</p>
      <p>If he wins the vote he would be immune from prosecution during his term.</p>
      <p>Social media has been abuzz with speculation about Rajapakse's citizenship, while a copy of a purportedly cancelled US passport shown by his lawyers has been challenged as fake.</p>
      <p>The US embassy in Colombo has declined to comment on the issue.</p>
      <p>Rajapakse and current housing minister Sajith Premadasa, are the leading candidates in a field of 35 contesting Saturday's election.</p>
