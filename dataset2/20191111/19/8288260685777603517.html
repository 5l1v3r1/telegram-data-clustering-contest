      <p>A convicted rapist sexually assaulted a five-year-old girl on a train just hours after being released from prison, a court has heard.</p>
      <p>Darren Rothwell, 42, committed the attack shortly after he left HMP Forest Bank in Salford, Greater Manchester, where he had been serving a sentence for harassment and assault.</p>
      <p>He boarded a train at Manchester Victoria on the morning of April 18 and intimidated two women travelling with their young children as he swore aggressively at them while drinking from a bottle of brandy.</p>
      <p>Rothwell was heard to tell the women to google his alias 'Darren Noonan', where they would have found online news coverage of his 2009 conviction for rape, sexual activity with a child and child abduction, said British Transport Police (BTP).</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>As the train approached Wigan, Rothwell asked the five-year-old daughter of one of the women for a hug.</p>
      <p>He then went to pick the child up before he sexually assaulted her in view of her horrified mother, said BTP.</p>
      <p>The alarm was raised and Rothwell was quickly identified by officers.</p>
      <p>Rothwell, of Scholes, Wigan, was jailed at Bolton Crown Court for 26 months on Friday after he pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to sexual assault.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Detective Constable Ian Grice said: "Rothwell clearly had absolutely no desire to rehabilitate himself after prison but to sexually assault a five-year-old child before he'd even made it home is beyond reprehensible.</p>
      <p>"He is clearly an exceptionally dangerous individual and I am relieved, as I'm sure his victim's family will be, to see him back behind bars.</p>
      <p>"I can't imagine how traumatic this must have been for them and I hope they are now able to begin to put this terrible incident behind them."</p>
