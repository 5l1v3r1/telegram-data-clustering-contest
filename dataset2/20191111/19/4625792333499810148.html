      <h1>‘Probably joyriding’: Porsche driver launches into second floor of building in fatal crash</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T19:18:56+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 19:18</time> by <a rel="author">Madison Dibble</a></address>
      <p>The driver of the Porsche Boxer that flew through the second floor of a building in Toms River, New Jersey, was “probably joyriding,” according to his girlfriend.</p>
      <p>Brandon DeMartin, 22, and his 23-year-old passenger Daniel Foley both died after DeMartin lost control and launched his vehicle through the second story of an office building.</p>
      <p>The crash took place early Sunday morning after the two men had been with other friends at a local pool hall on Saturday night. DeMartin’s girlfriend, Kristen Aguiar, <u><a href="https://www.nj.com/ocean/2019/11/porsche-driver-was-probably-joyriding-in-fatal-crash-into-2nd-floor-of-building-girlfriend-says.html">told</a></u> New Jersey Advance Media that the two were “probably joyriding.”</p>
      <p>“Me and him did it all the time,” Aguiar explained. She claimed she was supposed to be with DeMartin the night of the crash but had canceled plans to stay home.</p>
      <p>“I keep thinking he’s going to text me,” she said.</p>
      <p>DeMartin was in the 2010 red Boxster, which had been a gift from his father. Foley and DeMartin were high school friends.</p>
      <p>Nicholas McConnell, a friend of Foley, said he “was the nicest kid I’ve ever met.”</p>
      <p>Jillian Messina, a Toms River Police Department representative, said DeMartin was likely driving at excessive speeds when he hit an embankment, shooting him up into the building.</p>
      <p>Skid marks left in front of the embankment signal that the vehicle flew at least 100 feet before lodging in the side of the building. It took crews seven hours to <u><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/11/11/new-jersey-porsche-crash-toms-river-second-story-two-dead/2560237001/">dislodge</a></u> the vehicle. The building was <u><a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Car-Crashes-Into-New-Jersey-Toms-River-Buildings-Second-Floor-Killing-2-564723642.html">deemed</a></u> unsafe by local authorities until a full inspection has been completed to determine any structural damage.</p>
