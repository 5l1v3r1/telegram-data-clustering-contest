      <p>KUALA LUMPUR: Only one of five pilot reconstruction projects for fishermen's settlements in Perak, begun in 2014, have been completed with the remaining four still underway.</p>
      <p>Economic Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Mohamed Azmin Ali said the settlement that had been completed was located in Teluk Gedung, while the four delayed reconstructions are in Teluk Muroh, Kampung Masjid, Kampung Sungai Pinang and Teluk Kecil.</p>
      <p>The projects involve construction, renovation and restoration works, as well as the provision of basic infrastructure and facilities such as public halls and stalls for traders, he said.</p>
      <p>The reconstructions are aimed at establishing better-organised settlements which will enable fishermen to enjoy a better quality of life.</p>
      <p>Mohamed Azmin said that while there were suggestions that the reconstruction scheme be continued, his ministry was of the view that it would be more appropriate to look into the challenges faced in undertaking the five pilot projects, and discussions will also be held with the Agriculture and Agro-based Industry Ministry on the matter.</p>
      <p>He said this during the wrap-up of the debate on the draft Supply Bill 2020 in Parliament on Monday (Nov 11).</p>
      <p>Parliament will reconvene on Tuesday (Nov 12). <i>— Bernama</i></p>
