      <p>An indigenous community in Porac, Pampanga can now enjoy secure ways of saving their hard-earned money. The Aetas who live on farming, have recently opened Cebuana Lhuiillier Micro Savings accounts during an <i>Iponaryo</i> cascade.</p>
      <p>“We are happy that an Aeta community is now part of our growing number of <i>Iponaryos</i> who are a step closer to financial inclusion. This complements our #KayaNa: Unbanked Filipinos No More movement which provides unbanked and underbanked Filipinos with access to a savings account,” said Jean Henri Lhuillier, Cebuana Lhuillier president and CEO.</p>
      <p>During the cascade conducted by Iponaryo Ambassadors, the community members were excited to read the Cebuana Lhuillier Iponaryo booklet and do the invisible P50 savings challenge.</p>
      <p>“<i>Nakakatuwa po na may ganito na pala ang</i> Cebuana Lhuillier, <i>para ‘yung ipon namin na kakaunti galing sa pagsasaka at pangangalakal ay pwede naming itago sa</i> Cebuana at kunin kapag kailangan,” said Jojo Lansang, a Barangay Kagawad who is also an Aeta.</p>
      <p>Iponaryo Ambassadors from nearby Cebuana Lhuillier branches and offices reached Barangay Villamaria and Barangay Diaz, in Sitio Tarik, Pampanga after climbing a mountain and trekking through muddy terrain.</p>
      <p>From as early as June 2019, 8,000 Cebuana Lhuillier employees, dubbed “Iponaryo Ambassadors”, have been conducting cascades nationwide to promote the value of micro savings. In September, over two million Filipinos have already opened a Cebuana Lhuillier Micro Savings account to jumpstart their <i>Iponaryo</i> journey.</p>
