      <h2>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are heading to California to spend time with Doria Ragland, with Remembrance Sunday thought to be their last joint public engagement</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T19:58:55+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 19:58</time> by <a rel="author">Russell Myers, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/russell-myers/</a></address>
      <p>Prince Harry and Meghan may not come back to the UK for Christmas - deciding instead to spend it in America with Meghan’s mum instead.</p>
      <p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are heading to California to spend time with Doria Ragland, with Remembrance Sunday thought to be their last joint public engagement.</p>
      <p>The trip will come as part of a six-week break away from royal duties to allow the couple and their six month old son Archie to spend some “much-needed” family time together.</p>
      <p>Prince William, the Duchess of Cambridge and their three children are expected at Sandringham after spending 1st Christmas with Kate's family.</p>
      <p>If Harry and Meghan were to stay away it would suggest the rift with his brother he confirmed last month in a TV documentary is no further to being healed.</p>
      <p>Harry on Sunday will attend the inaugural OnSide Awards at the Royal Albert Hall on Sunday 17th November 2019.</p>

      <p>The OnSide Awards will bring together the whole of the OnSide community to recognise the achievements of young people, volunteers and staff.</p>
      <p>Awards will be presented to young people who have made a real difference in their community, have breakthrough talent, or have overcome the most challenging of circumstances.</p>
      <p>The family had been expected to return to the UK, where they will spend the remainder of the holiday season with the Queen at Sandringham in Norfolk, as is tradition.</p>
      <p>However, a senior palace source had told how the couple haven’t yet decided when they will come back and may yet stay and spend the Christmas holidays in the States.</p>

      <p>The source said: “It’s too early to tell exactly what they will end up doing, they haven’t decided.”</p>
      <p>This will be their first Christmas as a family-of-three following the birth of Archie in May.</p>
      <p>They decided to take some time out after appearing in an ITV documentary while on tour in Africa visitng some of the world’s poorest communities.</p>
      <p>In the documentary Harry, 35, told how he had drifted apart from his brother William while Meghan, 38, revealed how she was struggling with life in the public eye, even suggesting “no one has asked if I’m okay”.</p>

      <p>Meghan took around four months maternity leave and has lept busy with a series of projects since returning.</p>
      <p>The former actress collaborated on series of designs or ‘Smart Set collection with retailers John Lewis and Marks &amp; Spencer.</p>
      <p>She also guest edited Vogue where she famously refused to be on the cover, suggesting it would be “boastful” to appear on the cover.</p>
