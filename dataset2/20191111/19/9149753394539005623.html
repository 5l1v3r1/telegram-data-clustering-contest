      <h1>No early access to Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order for Origin subscribers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T19:49:03+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 19:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/anchalk/" target="_blank">Andy Chalk</a></address>
      <p>Electronic Arts commonly offers early access to its new games (like <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-battlefield-5/">Battlefield 5</a>, for instance) as a preorder bonus, and ten-hour trials to Origin Access basic subscribers. That will not be the case for the upcoming <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-release-date/">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a>, however, as EA said that it doesn't want spoilers to leak out before everyone has a chance to get their hands on it.</p>
      <p>The lack of early access was actually confirmed a couple of weeks ago in a <a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/General-Discussion/Star-Wars-Jedi-origin-access/td-p/7795678">support thread</a>, not exactly the highest-profile announcement channel available. Today's tweet is much harder to miss, and also hits on what you will get for preordering: An orange lightsaber blade, a Bee-D-1 skin, and two bonus lightsaber hilts with the standard edition, and all of that plus a second Bee-D-1 skin, a Crimson Mantis skin, a digital art book, and a behind-the-scenes video if you spring for the deluxe edition.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.origin.com/can/en-us/store/origin-access">Origin Access Premier</a> subscribers will have access to the full game at launch, but the ten-hour trial version that's typically offered to basic-tier subscribers will not available. Fear of spoilers isn't really a factor in that exclusion, but game length might be. I have no idea how many hours Fallen Order will put on the table but as a narrative-focused single player game, I'd expect something on the relatively short-ish side. </p>
      <p>Speaking for myself, I don't think keeping Fallen Order so tightly locked down is a particularly good look, and could even be seen as a lack of confidence in the game—a game EA surely needs to be a hit, given the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/disney-has-a-good-relationship-with-electronic-arts-ceo-says/">rough ride</a> it's had with the Star Wars license so far. We got some hands-on time with it last month and the lightsaber combat was good, but the game itself seemed <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-preview/">safe and unsurprising</a>.</p>
      <p>(And take it as you will, but Titanfall 2, which delivered an outstanding and very spoiler-susceptible single-player campaign, offered a three-day early access period with preorders.)</p>
      <p>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order comes out on November 15. In case you'd forgotten, it will be available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172380/STAR_WARS_Jedi_Fallen_Order/">Steam</a> as well as <a href="https://www.origin.com/can/en-us/store/star-wars/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order">Origin</a>.</p>
