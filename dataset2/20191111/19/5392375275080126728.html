      <p>After the release of the Samsung Galaxy Fold and the numerous issues that followed, Samsung now has more experience with foldable phones. There have been several reports that the company is working on another foldable device.

      <p>According to TENAA’s listing, this smartphone will come with a 4.6-inch display (folded) and a 4135 mAh battery. The phone measures 160.9 x 117.9 x 6.9 mm which is the same as the Samsung Galaxy Fold. The South Korean manufacturing giant released a series of posters earlier this week which shows that this smartphone will arrive on November 19 in Wuhan, China.</p>

      <p>From the poster, the Samsung W20 5G phone folds in the same way as the Samsung Galaxy Fold. It is also folded left and right and looks almost the same. Samsung W20 5G mobile phone is likely to be the 5G version of the Samsung Galaxy Fold. Considering that Samsung Galaxy Fold sells for as much as 15,999 yuan ($2292),  the Samsung W20 5G phone should approach 20,000 yuan ($2866). What do you think about the second foldable phone from Samsung? Let us know your thoughts in the comments.</p>
