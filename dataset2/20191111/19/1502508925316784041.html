      <h1>Second whistleblower letter launching personal attack on Infy CEO, surfaces</h1>
      <h2>This is said to be the 'undated' letter that Infosys had earlier informed in regulatory filing</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T19:29:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 19:29</time> by <a rel="author">BS Reporter</a></address>
      <p>Days after a whistle-blower letter accused <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/infosys">Infosys </a>CEO Salil Parekh of “unethical practices”, another such letter has now surfaced, which has brought in several personal allegations against him.</p>
      <p>Addressed to independent directors of the board and the chairman of Nomination and Remuneration Committee (NRC) at Infosys, the undated letter alleged that while Parekh continues to remain absent in the headquarters in Bengaluru, he prefers to stay in Mumbai to protect his personal investments in small <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/companies">companies.</a></p>
      <p>The whistleblower, who claimed to be part of Infosys' finance team, has also alleged that Parekh was not able to control cost and was leading the company towards a low margin regime. In the three-page letter which has been seen by Business Standard, the whistleblower has also launched vicious personal attacks against Parekh.</p>
      <p>While the company declined to comment, it is reliably learnt that <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/infosys">Infosys </a>had earlier informed the exchanges on October 22 about receiving two whistleblower mails including an undated one. The letter which has now been leaked to media, is said to be the same undated letter.</p>
      <p>In the first letter, whistleblower has alleged wrongdoing in accounting practices, which <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/infosys">Infosys </a>has vehemently denied.</p>
