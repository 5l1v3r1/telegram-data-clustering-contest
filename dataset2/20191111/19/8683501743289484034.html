      <p>The <i>Star Wars</i> franchise is on the edge of a precipice, and the generations of fans are eager for any glimpse of property's future. J.J. Abrams' <i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i> hits theaters on December, it looks like <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484296/star-wars-is-going-on-a-hiatus-following-the-rise-of-skywalker-according-to-bob-iger">there will be a hiatus</a> before the franchise returns to theaters. This will allow Lucasfilm and Disney to plan out its future installments, as there are <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483034/dont-worry-rian-johnson-is-still-working-on-his-star-wars-movies">a few potential projects</a> coming down the pipeline. Marvel Studios architect Kevin Feige <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481097/chris-evans-wants-in-on-kevin-feiges-star-wars-movie">was recently announced</a> to be getting involved in the galaxy far, far way. And now he's broken his silence about what his future <i>Star Wars</i> movie might be about.</p>
      <p>Kevin Feige's involvement in the <i>Star Wars</i> franchise is sure to excite longtime fans of the franchise, especially considering how successful the MCU has become. Feige has shown the ability to make human stories from extraordinary circumstances, so he might be the perfect filmmaker to tackle the future the galaxy after <i>The Rise of Skywalker</i> hits theaters. Feige spoke to his excitement about the upcoming project, saying:</p>
      <blockquote>I love that world and I love the notion of exploring new people and new places in that universe. But that’s sort of all that can be said for now.</blockquote>
      <p>Well, that's certainly exciting. It looks like Kevin Feige will help further expand the galaxy with his developing <i>Star Wars</i> movie. He'll be focusing on new characters and settings, which should be a groundbreaking new step after decades of following the Skywalker Saga. But exactly who those newcomers will be remains a complete mystery.</p>
      <p>Kevin Feige's comments to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/awards-chatter-podcast-kevin-feige-avengers-endgame-1253678">THR</a> are sure to delight the generations of <i>Star Wars</i> fans out there. George Lucas' colorful franchise has entertained moviegoers for decades, remaining at the top of pop culture since <i>A New Hope</i> arrived in 1977. But with The Rise of Skywalker completing the main story once and for all, the future of the franchise is unclear. Because without favorites like Leia, Vader, and Obi-Wan, the franchise is going to have to go big to keep some moviegoers invested.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The <i>Star Wars</i> franchise will be given new life on the small screen, while the movie side of things is planned out behind the scenes. <i>The Mandalorian</i> will launch with Disney+, and Ewan McGregor's Obi-Wan Kenobi will get his own untitled series on the streaming service. This will satiate the rabid fanbase, while breaking new ground for the property by introducing live-action shows.</p>
      <p>It was recently revealed that <i>Game of Thrones</i> creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483534/game-of-thrones-creators-reportedly-left-star-wars-over-fear-of-toxic-fandom">were no longer developing</a> a series of <i>Star Wars</i> movies. That makes Kevin Feige's potential projects all the more important to the franchise's future. <i>The Last Jedi</i> director Rian Johnson is also tasked with crafting a new installment in the galaxy far, far away. But with the upcoming release of <i>Knives Out</i>, Johnson <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483704/are-rian-johnsons-star-wars-movies-still-happening-hes-waiting-for-an-update-too">hasn't gotten to work</a> on the project yet.</p>
      <p><i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i> will hit theaters on December 20th.
