      <p>Salting trucks were out on Toronto roads in full force ahead of a forecasted messy commute caused by the city’s first major storm of the season.</p>
      <p>Around 11:30 a.m., city officials said that salt trucks were heading to Toronto’s expressways and that “spot salting” had started on main roads, hills and bridges.</p>
      <p>The trucks started to sprinkle salt on local roads around 1 p.m.</p>

      <p>Toronto is forecast to receive between 10cm and 15cm of snow. Mississauga, Brampton, Markham, Vaughan, Milton, Caledon, Richmond Hill, Pickering, Oshawa are also under a weather advisory.</p>
      <p>"This snowfall is due to a developing low pressure system which will track south of the lower Great Lakes on today," Environment Canada said Monday morning. </p>
      <p>The snow is expected to fall heaviest during the afternoon commute and through the evening. Drivers are being warned of hazardous conditions that could deteriorate rapidly. </p>
      <p>Vince Sferrazza, director of operations and maintenance for the City of Toronto, said that crews were working Sunday night in preparation for the snowfall.</p>
      <p>“As soon as we found out there was going to be a significant weather event today we began bringing in the crews and the equipment. So we are ready,” he told CP24 on Monday.</p>
      <p>“Last night we actually began pre-treating the expressways, hills and some other significant areas…That allows the salting operations to be more effective.”</p>
      <p>School buses <a href="https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/full-list-of-school-bus-cancellations-for-november-11-1.4679262">were cancelled</a> in Niagara and Halton regions. The schools remained open. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the City of Toronto is opening a warming centre at Metro Hall at 7 p.m. today.</p>
      <p>"While the threshold for an extreme cold weather alert won't be reached until tomorrow, out of an abundance of caution, staff are opening it tonight," city spokesperson Brad Ross tweeted. </p>
      <p>"Additional shelter beds have also opened up, with more opening up tomorrow."</p>
      <p>Air travellers are being advised <a href="https://www.torontopearson.com/en#">to check on the status of their flights</a> before heading out the airport. </p>
