      <h1>'Let's get rid of the f-----g judges': Anonymous book claims Trump wanted to reduce number of federal judges</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T12:53:59+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 12:53</time> by <a rel="author">Caitlin Yilek</a></address>
      <p>A new book by an anonymous Trump administration official claims the president instructed White House lawyers to draft a bill that would decrease the number of federal judges.</p>
      <p>"Can we just get rid of the judges? Let's get rid of the f-----g judges," President Trump <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-am-db27e9e3-9405-4776-b610-5e3d6d6416f8.html?chunk=5&amp;utm_term=twsocialshare#story5">is quoted</a> as saying. "There shouldn't be any at all, really."</p>
      <p>The forthcoming <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/anonymous-resistance-op-ed-author-tells-of-trump-officials-plan-for-midnight-self-massacre">tell-all book</a>, <i>A Warning</i>, says White House staff ignored Trump’s request.</p>
      <p>Trump has fumed publicly at the federal judiciary, particularly when it rules against his policies concerning immigration and the U.S. border with Mexico. He has claimed the rulings are evidence that the judges are politically biased.</p>
      <p>The White House has dismissed the book, which goes on sale Nov. 19, as “nothing but lies.”</p>
      <p>Trump has sought to leave a conservative imprint on the judiciary since he entered the White House. His administration <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/08/05/747013608/trumps-impact-on-federal-courts-judicial-nominees-by-the-numbers">has appointed</a> nearly 1 in 4 of the nation’s federal appeals court judges and 1 in 7 district court judges in the last two and half years.</p>
