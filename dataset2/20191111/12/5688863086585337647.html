        <b>India’s star para javelin thrower Sundar Singh Gurjar became the first Indian to clinch two consecutive World Championships medals after he won the yellow metal on Sunday, thereby sealing a spot for Paralympics spot. India now have two gold, one silver, and a bronze medal from the Championships.</b>
      </p>
      <p>One of India’s biggest hopes in the tournament, Gurjar was a doubt for the tournament as he had injured his shoulder. However, he overcame it brilliantly and went on to win his second gold medal for India with a season-best performance at the 2019 World Para Athletics Championships, being held in Dubai on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Gurjar was in the second place until his fifth attempt following which he hurled the javelin to a distance of 61.22 metres, which was enough to see him leapfrog Sri Lanka’s Dinesh P Herath Mudiyanselage to the top of the results table. The Sri Lankan was leading with his 60.59m throw that came in the first attempt.</p>
      <p>Apart from Gurjar, who defended his title from the London Worlds 2017, India also had Devendra Jhajharia, who had won a gold and a silver in the 2013 Lyon and 2015 Doha Championships. However, India also saw Ajeet Singh managing a throw of 59.46 metres to claim the bronze medal. Rinku ended up taking the fourth place with a throw of 57.59 metres as India saw three more slots for Tokyo 2020 Paralympics.</p>
      <p>India have now garnered two gold medals, one silver and a bronze from these Championships. Monday would see as many as six Indian players in action, which would be including Ekta Bhyan and Kashish Lakra in the women’s club throw F51 final and Yogesh Kathuniya in the men’s discus throw F56 Final.indiapayl</p>
