      <p>SRINAGAR (Web Desk): Indian troops have martyred one more Kashmiri youth in Bandipore district as the occupied valley of Kashmir has continued to reel under lockdown on 99th day, Kashmir Media Service.</p>

      <p>The National Conference has condemned the IOK admin for disallowing religious gatherings at the holy Hazratbal Shrine on the occasion of Eid-e-Milad-un-Nabi [SAWS], saying such a measure is tantamount to violation of people’s religious freedom.</p>
      <p>Tamil Nadu’s principal opposition party, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), has slammed Indian government for turning IOK into a huge prison, demanding New Delhi to respect the sensitivities of the people of the territory.<br/><br/>A resolution adopted at its general council meet in Chennai condemned New Delhi for its August 5 actions without taking the approval of the IOK Assembly and eliciting the views of the people there. It has also urged the govt to immediately free all those arrested in Kashmir. </p>
