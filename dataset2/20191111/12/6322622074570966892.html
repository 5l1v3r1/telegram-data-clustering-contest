      <h1>BFood says 1Q profit impacted by new accounting standard, plans 1 sen dividend</h1>

      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 11): Berjaya Food Bhd (BFood) reported a net profit of RM4.61 million for the first quarter ended Sept 30, 2019 (1QFY20) or 1.28 sen per share, on the back of RM180.44 million in revenue.</p>
      <p>There were no comparative year-on-year figures provided, due to a change in its financial year end. Nevertheless, BFood said in a statement that its profit before tax for the quarter under review, which came in at RM8.57 million, was adversely impacted by the adoption of MFRS 16: Leases.</p>
      <p>"MFRS 16 requires depreciation be charged on the right-of-use assets and interest expenses be incurred on lease liability, instead of lease rental expenses, which was required by the previous accounting standard for leases, MFRS 117, to be charged out in profit and loss.</p>
      <p>"In the current quarter under review and on the aggregate, the depreciation of right-of-use assets and the lease liability interest expense are higher than the lease rental expenses. Thus, this resulted in a lower profit before tax upon the adoption of MFRS 16.</p>
      <p>"The profit before tax would have been RM10.78 million, if the lease rentals of all the leased outlets were accounted for under the previous accounting standard for leases," BFood said.</p>
      <p>The group's board recommended an interim dividend of one sen, payable on Dec 27, 2019.</p>
      <p>Looking ahead, BFood said its overall results for the remaining quarters of the financial year ending June 30, 2020 (FY20) will continue to be adversely impacted by the adoption of MFRS 16, as almost all of the group's operating outlets are on lease.</p>
      <p>“Nevertheless, the group expects to mitigate this adverse impact with Starbucks maintaining its revenue growth momentum, and the group expanding both its income streams from new franchise business and its existing business. With these, it is anticipated that the operating results of the group will remain satisfactory in the remaining quarters,” it said.</p>
      <p>BFood shares closed three sen or 2.14% lower to RM1.37 today, valuing the company at RM490 million. The stock is little changed from when it was trading at RM1.40 apiece a year ago.</p>
