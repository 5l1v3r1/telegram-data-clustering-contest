      <p>(LONDON) — Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage says his party will not run in almost half of the U.K. seats in Britain’s election.</p>
      <p>Farage says the party will not run in 317 Conservative-held seats so it does not split the pro-Brexit vote.</p>
      <p>The announcement marks a major shift in the party’s strategy for the Dec, 12 election, since last week Farage said the party would run in 600 seats.</p>
      <p>Farage has been under huge pressure from Brexit supporters not to run candidates in seats where there is a risk of splitting the Brexit vote.</p>
      <p>On the weekend, several right-wing British newspapers urged him to change tack, saying there was a risk that Britain might not leave the EU if the Labour Party comes to power. Labour is promising to hold a new referendum on whether to leave the bloc or remain.</p>
