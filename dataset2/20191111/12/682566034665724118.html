      <p>Cape Town - <b>Kaizer Chiefs</b> star <b>Khama Billiat</b> says the dressing room atmosphere has improved under coach <b>Ernst Middendorp</b> which has contributed to their impressive form.</p>
      <p>Amakhosi are at the top of the Absa Premiership standings after 11 games, winning nine, and have opened up a 10-point lead over second-placed Mamelodi Sundowns after beating Orlando Pirates 3-2 in the Soweto derby on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Billiat is enjoying life at Chiefs and hopes the good times will keep rolling for a long time as they aim to end their four-year trophy drought.</p>
      <p>"The guys look so happy. It's good that we are gelling together so well and it's scary, but it requires a lot of paying attention to small details especially when you are winning. You don't want to do the wrong things," Billiat told the media.</p>
      <p>"We try to do the things we did right before. We also try to look at the things we didn't do well and try to rectify them to become better."</p>
      <p>Asked about the change in atmosphere at the club, Billiat added: "We definitely feel different. We feel like we are more united. We feel like we are more united to help the club. It's just a good feeling around and hopefully, it's here to stay."</p>
