      <h1>Former Man City midfielder makes controversial claim about Pep Guardiola and VAR</h1>
      <h2>Pep Guardiola had been enraged during the Liverpool clash as his side were twice denied penalties for possible handballs against Trent Alexander-Arnold</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T12:08:16+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 12:08</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Former Manchester City midfielder Trevor Sinclair has claimed that Pep Guardiola could quit the Premier League if VAR continues to cause controversy.</p>
      <p>City boss Guardiola appeared to thank Michael Oliver for his performance in a theatrical way after his team were beaten 3-1 by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The Spanish coach had been enraged during the Premier League clash as his side were twice denied penalties for possible handballs against Trent Alexander-Arnold.</p>
      <p>The first was the most controversial, coming immediately before Fabinho opened the scoring. The second came late on as City rallied in response to further goals from Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane.</p>

      <p>And Sinclair, who enjoyed a four-year playing spell at City before quitting in 2007, reckons the Spanish boss will not think twice about joining a European rival - should the VAR debate rage on.</p>
      <p>“The Premier League has got a fantastic brand and I think it’s been affected negatively by this VAR situation," Sinclair told <a href="https://talksport.com/football/628272/pep-guardiola-leave-premier-league-var-man-city-trevor-sinclair/"><i>TalkSport</i> </a>. "It’s not a better spectacle now because VAR has been brought in.</p>
      <p>“Pep wants clarity to what the rules are, because at the moment the fans, players and managers haven’t got a clue. This is my fear, that if this continues managers like Pep and the best players are going to start leaving the Premier League.</p>
      <p>“If it continues to be this inconsistent, people are going to start leaving the Premier League and go to different leagues.</p>

      <p>“I think Pep is right on the cusp. The Premier League is so good because we get the very best managers who attract the very best players.</p>
      <p>“If you want to go to a top club, you look at who the manager is there. That’s how City have got the players they have got – because of Pep.</p>
      <p>“Now, if managers start leaving the Premier League because there’s no consistency and it’s a flawed system, I think they’re in danger of ruining what they’ve produced over the last 25 years in the Premier League.”</p>
      <p>City's late rally did produce a reply from Bernardo Silva but Premier League leaders Liverpool did not surrender an advantage that saw them move nine points clear of the champions.</p>
