      <p>Train services in the Kashmir Valley, which were disrupted since August 3 ahead of the abrogation of provisions of Article 370, will resume on Tuesday, a Northern Railway official said.</p>
      <p>The valley had been under restrictions after August 5, when the Centre revoked the special status to <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/jammu-and-kashmir">Jammu and Kashmir </a>and bifurcated it into union territories.</p>
      <p>"After appropriate action and assurance by GRP, J&amp;K regarding safe operation of train in Kashmir Valley between 10 AM and 3 PM, the Firozpur Division will commence a limited passenger service of running two pair of trains between Srinagar-Baramulla-Srinagar with effect from November 12," an official said.</p>
