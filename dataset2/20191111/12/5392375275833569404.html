      <p>Watch out! YouTube could ban your account if you block ads<br/>3.2 (64.57%) 35 votes</p>
      <p>If you recently received a notification in your YouTube account when watching videos, or an email, indicating that the world’s most popular online video platform has changed its terms and conditions of service. Then, you should know that this notification has been received by all users who use this platform.</p>
      <p>YouTube has changed its policies, which will be effective as of December 2019. And there are some points within these changes that have not left the community happy at all.</p>
      <h3>Do you use an extension to block ads? Be careful, YouTube could block your account</h3>
      <p>One of the most controversial changes added is that YouTube could ban users’ accounts that use some type of ads blocker. In other words, if you use Adblock or some type of app or extension to not see the advertising that appears on YouTube. Well … Your account could be banned forever.</p>

      <p>The specific point mentioned in this action, says the following: “YouTube may terminate your access. Or your Google account’s access to all or part of the Service if YouTube believes, in its sole discretion, that provision of the Service to you is no longer commercially viable.”</p>
      <p>This makes it very clear that not only could they ban you from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a>, they could also unsubscribe your Gmail, Adsense, Adwords and all the services related to the Google world.</p>
      <h3>The deactivation of ads block extensions is highly recommended</h3>
      <p>From here, we recommend you to deactivate any extension or application that blocks ads on YouTube. As you could run the risk of a permanent ban. Remember that you can add exceptions so that the app or extension does not work on certain websites. So it is not necessary to “uninstall” this tool to not be banned by <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/Google">Google</a>.</p>
      <p>When we know more about this type of action that Google plans to take with YouTube. Which will be in force since December 10, 2019, we will add more information.</p>
