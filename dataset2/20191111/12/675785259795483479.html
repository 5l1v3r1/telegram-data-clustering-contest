      <h1>BREAKING General election: Humiliated Nigel Farage pulls Brexit Party out of 317 seats</h1>
      <h2>It is a humiliation for the Brexit Party leader after he repeatedly issued an empty threat to stand 600 candidates in the general election 2019</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T12:15:53+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 12:15</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Glaze, Dan Bloom, https://www.facebook.com/MirrorPolitics, https://www.facebook.com/mirrordanbloom</a></address>
      <p>Nigel Farage today pulled the Brexit Party out of all 317 Tory seats in a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">general election</a> humiliation after Boris Johnson refused his repeated pleas for a formal pact.</p>
      <p>Mr Farage announced: "The Brexit Party will not contest the 317 seats the Conservative won at the last election".</p>
      <p>He claimed it would pose a new threat to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> as the party focuses all its effort on Labour-held seats.</p>
      <p>But it is also a humiliation after Farage's allies ramped up pressure on him to drop <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> Party candidates and form a 'Leave alliance' with the Tories - only for none to happen.</p>
      <p>Allies of Farage and of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> were in secretive last-minute talks over the weekend to try to strike a deal ahead of Thursday's 4pm cut-off for candidate nominations.</p>
      <p>But Farage had been standing by a threat to stand 600 Brexit Party candidates if a deal fell through - leading to candidates quitting and fury from long time ally Arron Banks.</p>
      <p>The insurance tycoon claimed it could "split the vote so badly it could open the door of 10 Downing Street to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> ". He added: "It is time for Nigel and his supporters to be realistic."</p>
      <p>It was a humiliation for Farage, who originally demanded Boris Johnson "renounce" his Withdrawal Agreement to save facing the Brexit Party in 600 seats across the country.</p>
      <p>Days later <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/general-election-panicking-nigel-farage-20831748">he watered down the threat</a> after it prompted a massive backlash and some Brexit Party candidates quit.</p>
      <p>Instead he demanded to the Political Declaration, to rule out an extension of the transition period beyond 2020, or a future trade deal that has "regulatory alignment" with the EU.</p>
      <p>Today Mr Farage attempted to claim his demands had been met.</p>
      <p>He pointed to Boris Johnson's aim for a "super Canada plus" trade deal with no alignment, and his verbal commitment not to extend the transition period beyond 2020.</p>
      <p>But he admitted it had been a "difficult decision to make”.</p>
      <p>He added: "I’ve genuinely tried for months to put about the idea that putting country before party at a moment like this is the right thing to do but that effectively has come to nought."</p>
