      <p>However, her joy was short-lived after it was announced that she did not secure enough votes to make it to the top 2.</p>
      <p>We chatted to Micayla about her <i>Idols</i> experience, her trip to NYC, and what it’s like having her own single out.</p>
      <p>
        <b>You had a very exciting trip to New York last week. Can you tell us a bit more about it, and what was the highlight of your trip?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The highlight of my trip was shopping and walking around the streets of New York. Just being able to walk in Times Square was so amazing. I really enjoyed that.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What was your journey like on the show?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I have grown in so many ways; I have become a better version of myself.</p>

        <b>What is the biggest lesson you learned about yourself during the competition?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The biggest lesson I learned was to stay humble. I was a very humble person and very quiet, and I always had a smile on my face.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What does it feel like to have your own, original single out?</b>
      </p>
      <p>It feels extremely surreal. Although I have a cover out, this is something completely different. I love it, and I am proud of it. </p>
      <p>
        <b>What is next for you?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I am not entirely sure yet, but I hope that I can collaborate with Nasty C.</p>
