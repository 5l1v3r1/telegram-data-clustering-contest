      <h1>Katamari creator's friend-making game 'Wattam' arrives December 17th</h1>
      <h2>It'll be available on the PS4 as well as the Epic Game Store on PCs.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T12:21:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 12:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.facebook.com/jonathanf" target="_blank">Jon Fingas</a></address>
      <p>Ready to once again dive into the weird-but-welcoming mind of <i>Katamari Damacy</i> creator Keita Takahashi? You won't have to wait too much longer. Funomena and Annapurna Interactive have finally <a href="https://twitter.com/A_i/status/1193906228176535553">nailed down</a> a release date for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/06/15/wattam-keita-takahashi-e3-interview/">friendship-focused <i>Wattam</i></a>, and now expect to release it on PS4 and PC (through the Epic Games Store) on December 17th. It's available for <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/wattam/home">pre-order</a> on Epic's store now for a discounted $17, and you should see a similar discount for the PS4 when it reaches the PlayStation Store. The game is eventually coming to Steam, although there's no date for that just yet.</p>
      <p>However you play, the concept is the same. You're a green, cube-shaped mayor whose quest is to reconnect the community by performing various (and frequently strange) helpful activities to win them over, such as helping a balloon get over its fear of heights. It's a deliberate contrast to the conflict-driven games that dominate the landscape, and arguably a relief in a world where division and hatred appear to be on the rise.</p>
