      <h1>Pink Palace opens royals' lavish private suite on Airbnb from £779 a night</h1>
      <h2>The City Palace of Jaipur is opening up the suite usually reserved for royals and their guests on Airbnb and guests will get their own butler, private pool and city guide</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T12:31:36+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 12:31</time> by <a rel="author">Julie Delahaye, https://www.facebook.com/juliedjourno</a></address>
      <p>The phrase 'a stay fit for royalty' can be thrown around a lot, but that's exactly what's offer on a brand new <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/airbnb">Airbnb</a> listing.</p>
      <p>That's because the 300-year-old City Palace of Jaipur is home to Jaipur's Royal Family - and now they're opening one of their lavish private suites for stays.</p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, it's total luxury that will be on offer in the Gudliya Suite. We're talking your very own dedicated butler, a guide to show you the highlights of the city and organise private tours or guided walks, and even a private indoor swimming pool.</p>
      <p>Oh, and you can of course tuck into authentic Rajasthani meals, or if you prefer you can have afternoon tea in the lush gardens in the company of the resident peacocks.</p>
      <p>Then of course the suite itself is the epitome of glamour with a huge bedroom, bathroom and even its own lounge and kitchen.</p>

      <p>Until now, rooms in the Palace were reserved for the royals and their guests, so this marks the first time in history that a room in the Palace can be booked by members of the public.</p>
      <p>The host? 21-year old Maharajah, Padmanabh Singh, who succeeded his grandfather in 2011.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately if you want to book a stay, you're going to need quite the budget (this is a suite for royals, of course).</p>
      <p>You can already <a href="http://airbnb.com/CityPalaceJaipur">book stays on Airbnb</a> where prices are $1,000 a night (approx £779) - but this is an inaugural rate for 2019. From January 2020 onwards, stays will be $8,000 a night (£6,235)</p>
      <p>The suite is available for stays from Saturday 23rd November 2019.</p>

      <p>The proceeds raised by the bookings will be used to support Princess Diya Kumari Foundation, a non-profit organisation dedicated to supporting women in rural areas, as well as artisans in Rajasthan.</p>

      <p>His Highness Maharaja Sawai Padmanabh Singh: "I am thrilled that my family and I are partnering with Airbnb to bring the splendour of Rajasthan to life for travelers from around the world.</p>
      <p>"My own travels with Airbnb have made me feel very welcome in new cities and cultures, and I am happy that the experience of quintessential Indian hospitality will be shared with others."</p>

      <p>Of course you don't need to be a royal to visit the City Palace - there are parts of it which are open to the public.</p>
      <p>Highlights include the iconic audience hall to the Pink Courtyard, where you can wander through the impressive halls and take in the architecture.</p>
      <p>In fact, it's just one of the brilliant things to see and do in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/travel/asia-middle-east/indias-pink-city-ridiculously-pretty-13125320">India's Pink City</a> .</p>
