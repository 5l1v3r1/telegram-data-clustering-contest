      <p><b>LONDONÂ (AP)</b> - Shares around the world fell Monday as hopes for a breakthrough in the trade war between the United States and China diminished after President Donald Trump said Washington had not agreed to gradually roll back tariffs as negotiations progress.</p>
      <p>Hopes were shaken when Trump on Friday dismissed a Chinese official's assertion that the U.S. side had agreed to gradually lift tariffs on Chinese goods that it has imposed in the conflict over trade and technology policies.</p>
      <p>A Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesman had said Thursday that the two sides had agreed to a phased cancellation of their tariff hikes as part of an agreement now under negotiation.</p>
      <p>"They'd like to have a rollback," Trump told reporters at the White House. "I haven't agreed to anything."</p>
      <p>That raised doubts in the markets that some sort of agreement is imminent.</p>
      <p>"Market participants have become more cautious over the potential positive impact for global growth from a partial US-China trade deal," said Lee Hardman, an analyst at MUFG Bank.</p>
      <p>In Europe, Germany's DAX fell 0.4% to 13,176 while the CAC 40 in France was down 0.1% at 5,884.</p>
      <p>Britain's FTSE 100 index underperformed, falling by 1.2% to 7,270 after the pound struck a one-week high of $1.2880 following the news that the Brexit Party won't contest seats won by the governing Conservative Party in 2017 so as not to split the pro-Brexit vote. That announcement could boost the chances that Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives win a majority in the general election on Dec. 12.</p>
      <p>U.K. stocks often have an inverse relationship with the pound as many companies listed on the index are international companies so a higher currency could weigh on exports as well as reducing their dollar earnings.</p>
      <p>In Asia, Hong Kong led the retreat, with the Hang Seng losing 2.6% to 26,926.55 after a police officer shot and wounded a protester.</p>
      <p>Uncertainty has risen in the city after more than five months of protests that began with a fight over an extradition bill that has expanded to include demands for greater democracy and police accountability.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in Asia, the Shanghai Composite index declined 1.8% to 2,909.97, while Japan's Nikkei 225 index lost 0.3% to 23,331.84. South Korea's Kospi dropped 0.6% to 2,124.09 while the Sensex in India lost 0.1% to 40,287.29.</p>
      <p>Australia's S&amp;P ASX/200 was the sole major index to advance, gaining 0.7% to 6,772.50. Taiwan's benchmark dropped 1.3% and shares were lower in Southeast Asia.</p>
      <p>In other trading, benchmark crude oil lost 75 cents to $56.49 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange while Brent crude oil, the international standard, lost 70 cents to $61.81 per barrel.</p>
      <p>In currency markets, the euro was up 0.2% at $1.1036 while the dollar fell 0.3% to 108.93 yen.</p>
