      <p>A man climbed the Australian Parliament building in Canberra on Monday in a solo protest demanding the release of Julian Assange.</p>
      <p>The protester, wearing a black suit and hat, was (literally) blowing the whistle as he yelled, “Free the whistle-blowers” and “free Julian Assange.”</p>
      <p>The man promised to stay up there until Assange is released from jail and told onlookers to get him a sleeping bag. He put up a banner reading, “Free Assange. No US extradition” and walked across the glass roof of Parliament House before police arrested him.</p>
      <p>There has been no word on whether the protester is facing any charges.</p>

      <p>Julian Assange, an Australian citizen, is currently serving a 50-week jail term for skipping bail in 2012 to avoid being sent to Sweden. He was wanted there on charges of sexual assault, which he rejected as politically motivated.</p>

      <p>Assange, the founder of the famous anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks, sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and stayed there for almost seven years until April this year, when Ecuador stripped him of his asylum status.</p>
      <p>He <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201910211077106355-wikileaks-editor-in-chief-says-expectations-for-assanges-us-extradition-hearing-hopeful/">is facing an extradition to the United States</a> on charges relating to the publication of diplomatic cables and exposing damning evidence against the US-led military campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq. The 17 counts combined carry a maximum prison sentence of 175 years. The extradition hearing is scheduled to start on 25 February.</p>
      <p>Last month, 11 Australian MPs formed a cross-party group to advocate for bringing Assange home.</p>
      <p>"Whatever people may think of him, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201909251076888397-pamela-anderson-claims-uk-australia-subservient-to-us-for-keeping-julian-assange-behind-bars/">Julian Assange is an Australian</a> and deserves consular assistance and support from the Australian government," said Labour MP Julian Hill, a member of the group.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison has made it clear his government would let the legal processes in Britain run their course and said Assange “should face the music.”</p>
