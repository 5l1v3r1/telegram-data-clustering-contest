      <p>A stray cat is lucky to be alive after suffering chemical burns.</p>
      <p>Cats Protection’s Lanarkshire Branch found three-year-old Taz close to death, after he was believed to have come into contact with chemicals, leaving him with severely burnt skin and fur.</p>
      <p>The CPL are taking good care of him as he begins his long road to recovery, but they are now are appealing for donations towards his vet bills.</p>
      <p>Taz had been hanging around a local smallholding, where a kind lady had been feeding him.</p>
      <p>He disappeared for a several weeks and when he turned up in a neighbour’s garden he was in a terrible state.</p>
      <p>He was rushed to the vets, where he was diagnosed with chemical burns.</p>
      <p>CPL branch co-ordinator, Alex Thomson, said: “We believe it is likely that he put his head into some kind of agricultural chemicals as he had been spotted on a local farm.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Taz has been taken in by one of our fosterers, who has been offering him plenty of TLC, as well as painstakingly applying antibiotic cream to affected areas every day.</p>

      <p>"This has been painful and difficult for him but he has learnt to trust her, and we are starting to see slight improvements.”</p>
      <p>Because of the severity of Taz’s injuries he requires ongoing vet treatment.</p>
      <p>Volunteers at the Lanarkshire Branch of Cats Protection are hoping that fellow cat-lovers will dig deep to donate after seeing Taz’s plight.</p>
      <p>Alex added: “We don’t often do public appeals but this is a long term and expensive case, but it is worth it as he is the most friendly and affectionate little guy you can imagine, despite his ordeal.”  </p>
