      <h1>Twitter reveals how it plans to address deepfakes</h1>
      <h2>It wants you to weigh in on draft guidelines for handling 'synthetic and manipulated media.'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T12:31:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 12:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.engadget.com/editors/kris-holt" target="_blank">Kris Holt</a></address>
      <p>Twitter said last month <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/22/twitter-new-rules-deepfakes/">it was working on ways to better to handle deepfakes</a>. It just <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2019/synthetic_manipulated_media_policy_feedback.html">released draft guidelines</a> on how to address the problem and it's looking for the public to weigh in and help shape policies on what it describes as "synthetic and manipulated media."</p>
      <p>Twitter says it'll define "synthetic and manipulated media as any photo, audio, or video that has been significantly altered or fabricated in a way that intends to mislead people or changes its original meaning." It noted such manipulations are often called deepfakes and shallowfakes.</p>
      <p>As the guidelines stand, when Twitter discovers deepfakes on its service, it may:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>place a notice next to Tweets that share synthetic or manipulated media;</li>
        <li>warn people before they share or like Tweets with synthetic or manipulated media; or</li>
        <li>add a link -- for example, to a news article or Twitter Moment -- so that people can read more about why various sources believe the media is synthetic or manipulated.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If Twitter determines a tweet that includes a deepfake or shallowfake "could threaten someone's physical safety or lead to other serious harm," it might just remove the tweet entirely. Twitter <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/02/07/twitter-joins-those-banning-deepfake-ai-porn/">already banned porn deepfakes last year</a>.</p>
      <p>The guidelines aren't yet set in stone, and Twitter's looking for feedback <a href="https://survey.twitterfeedback.com/survey/selfserve/53b/191016?list=3&amp;co=BLOG#?">through a survey</a> and tweets with the hashtag #TwitterPolicyFeedback. You'll have until Wednesday, November 27th at 6:59 p.m. ET to weigh in. After reviewing and incorporating feedback, it'll announce a formalized version of the guidelines at least 30 days before they come into force.</p>
      <p>Not only can deepfakes be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/01/01/scarlett-johansson-fighting-deepfake-porn-lost-cause/">directly damaging to people</a>, they can be used in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/26/fake-news-disinformation-state-backed/">disinformation campaigns</a>, including ones backed by states. Twitter is one of several major tech companies exploring ways to tackle deepfakes. Amazon, for instance, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/21/amazon-joins-facebook-deepfake-challenge/">recently signed up to</a> Facebook's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/05/facebook-microsoft-mit-fight-deepfakes/">Deepfake Detection Challenge</a>, along with Microsoft, MIT and others. The group is building open-source tools to help governments and organizations identify deepfakes.</p>
