      <p>The original production of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s The Phantom of the Opera is coming to Plymouth, it has been announced.</p>
      <p>Now in its 34th year in the West End, Phantom is widely considered one of the most spectacular productions in theatre history.</p>
      <p>The score includes Music of the Night, All I Ask of You, Masquerade and the iconic title song.</p>
      <p>The Phantom of the Opera tells the tale of a disfigured musical genius known only as ‘The Phantom’ who haunts the depths of the Paris Opera House.</p>
      <p>Mesmerised by the talents and beauty of a young soprano – Christine, the Phantom lures her as his protégé and falls fiercely in love with her.</p>
      <p>Unaware of Christine’s love for Raoul, the Phantom’s obsession sets the scene for a dramatic turn of events where jealousy, madness and passions collide.</p>
      <p>Produced by Cameron Mackintosh and the Really Useful group Ltd, it is one of the most successful musicals in history playing to over 145 million people in 41 countries and 183 cities in 17 languages. It has won more than 70 major theatre awards, including seven Tonys and 4 Oliviers.</p>
      <p>The Phantom of the Opera is the only show in history to have celebrated 30 years on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
      <p>In October 2016 the London production celebrated its 30th anniversary with a special gala performance at Her Majesty’s Theatre and in October 2011 the London production celebrated its 25th anniversary with a spectacular staging of “The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall” which was screened live in cinemas all over the world and subsequently released on DVD.</p>
      <p>The musical became the longest running show in Broadway history on January 9 2006 when it celebrated its 7,486th performance.</p>
      <p>On 1 January 2018 it celebrated its 13,000th performance and later that month on 24 January the Broadway production celebrated an amazing 30 years on Broadway.</p>

Book is by Richard Stilgoe and Andrew Lloyd Webber, based on the novel ‘Le Fantôme de l’Opera’ by Gaston Leroux, with orchestrations by David Cullen and Andrew Lloyd Webber. It is produced by Cameron Mackintosh and The Really Useful Group Ltd.</p>
