      <h2>Former world heavyweight champion Fury has spoken candidly about the mental health struggles he endured after his victory over Wladimir Klitschko</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T12:18:21+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 12:18</time> by <a rel="author">James Whaling, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/james-whaling/</a></address>
      <p>Tyson Fury has opened up on his suicide bid in the aftermath of his victory over Wladimir Klitschko.</p>
      <p>Despite being crowned undisputed heavyweight champion of the world in November 2015, Fury was overcome by a feeling of emptiness in the coming months and ballooned in weight - reaching 28 stone at his heaviest.</p>
      <p>He hit rock-bottom in June 2016 when - enveloped by a mood "as black as my boots" - he decided to end it all by driving into a motorway bridge.</p>
      <p>In his upcoming autobiography <i>Behind The Mask,</i> released on Thursday, Fury recalls: "The Ferrari’s engine roared into life. It would be the last sound I would hear.</p>
      <p>“In a couple of seconds my mind would be clear, devoid of all the voices boiling in my head. I put my foot to the floor. Then a voice shot into my head, ‘Stop! Think about your kids!’ I blasted past the bridge.”</p>

      <p>Fury became known as an outlandish extrovert earlier in his career and hit the headlines for the wrong reasons as he was accused of homophobia and sexism with some of his comments.</p>
      <p>Now a much calmer character - certainly away from the spotlight - Fury admits the persona was often an act.</p>
      <p>“Maybe it was an act," he told the Sunday Times Magazine. "Maybe I was doing it to become famous because I know controversy sells.</p>

      <p>“People ain’t really interested in someone who’s normal. People want to see a freak show to sell papers and sell views on a TV.</p>
      <p>“Before, I was a performing monkey, I’ve done everything from A to Z to be famous and it got me to where I wanted to be, that elevated position where every motherf***er knows who <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tyson-fury">Tyson Fury</a> is. Now I can be me.”</p>
      <p>Fury reveals in the book he suffered from mental health issues even as a child - including petrifying hallucinations up to the age of nine.</p>

      <p>“I suffered from boiling temperatures that would make me delusional," he writes. "I’d be screaming at my mum and dad that lions were going to eat me and that the curtains were on fire.”</p>
      <p>Fury was "hit like a sledgehammer" when dad and boxing mentor John was sentenced to 11 years behind bars for gouging a man's eye out.</p>
      <p>“It hit me like a sledgehammer," says Fury. "He had always been there for me throughout my amateur and professional career, and now I wasn’t going to see him for many years.</p>
      <p>"From then on it was pretty tough to keep myself positive, because I missed my dad terribly.”</p>

      <p>Fury is set to return to the ring for an eagerly-anticipated rematch with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/deontay-wilder">Deontay Wilder</a> for the American's WBC strap in February, after their first bout ended in a controversial draw.</p>
      <p>Wilder must first get past Luis Ortiz in another rematch later this month.</p>
      <p>In the meantime Fury has been keeping fit - and swelling his wallet - with a stint in the WWE, which saw him beat Braun Strowman at the Crown Jewel PPV in Saudi Arabia.</p>
