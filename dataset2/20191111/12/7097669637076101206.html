      <h1>Boris Johnson on Track for Win, With Majority on Knife Edge, Odds Say</h1>

      <p>If you listen to bookmakers, the central question in the U.K. general election is not whether Boris Johnson will win, but by how much.</p>
      <p>Johnson is the overwhelming favorite to remain as prime minister after the Dec. 12 poll, according to bookmaker Paddy Power. At 3/1 on to lead the next government, punters would need to bet three pounds ($3.86) to win one pound -- effectively meaning the betting firm gives Johnson a 75% chance to keep his job.</p>
      <p>Odds also suggest he has an increasing chance of winning an overall majority in Parliament -- which he has repeatedly said he needs to end the impasse over Brexit.</p>
      <p>On Monday, Ladbrokes placed about a 60% chance on a Johnson majority, even before Nigel Farage said his Brexit Party will not contest the 317 seats won by the Conservatives in 2017.</p>
      <p>“A hung parliament was the most likely scenario according to the betting last week, but the bookies are reporting a fair move towards a Tory majority by punters over the weekend,” Ladbrokes said.</p>
      <p>Analysts and traders study bookmakers’ odds to help predict the outcome of market-moving events, though their reliability was dealt a blow in the 2016 referendum on the U.K.’s membership of the European Union. As the campaign ended, odds implied a 90% chance of voters opting to remain in the bloc.</p>
      <p>The current election odds are backed by recent opinion polls, which give the Conservatives a 12 percentage point lead over Labour on average.</p>
      <p>The odds on Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn winning are 2/1 against, effectively a 33% chance, meaning gamblers would need to risk one pound to win two. His party has about a 5% chance of an overall majority in the House of Commons, according to Betfair.</p>
