      <h1>2020 Volkswagen Vento BSVI petrol spotted testing</h1>

      <p>A <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/volkswagen/vento-m174/">Volkswagen Vento</a> test mule was spotted on the Mumbai-Pune expressway recently. The 'petrol' inscription over the fuel filler cap makes us think that this is the BSVI iteration of the Vento's petrol motor.</p>

      <p>The Volkswagen Vento BSVI is expected to continue with its 1.2-litre 4-cylinder turbo-petrol with 105PS and 175Nm. We don't know if Volkswagen will continue to offer the 1.6-litre petrol, available on the lower trim level or choose to continue with a single engine option. The 1.5-litre turbo-diesel is expected to be discontinued, given that the Volkswagen group is moving its focus away from diesel engines in the Indian market. The petrol-only Vento is expected to continue until 2021, when an all-new sedan based on the MQB-A0-IN architecture will make a debut in India a<a href="http://overdrive.in/news-cars-auto/skoda-auto-and-volkswagen-merge-india-operations/">s per the Skoda-led 'India 2.0' initiative</a>.</p>
      <p>Prices for the Volkswagen Vento currently start at Rs 10.58 lakh (on-road Mumbai) for the 1.6 Trendline and go up to Rs 17.57 lakh (on-road Mumbai) for the diesel Highline AT. It competes with the likes of the <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/honda/city-m58/">Honda City</a>, <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/hyundai/verna-m609/">Hyundai Verna</a>, <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/toyota/yaris-m645/">Toyota Yaris</a>, and its Skoda twin, the Rapid. We expect Volkswagen India to launch the Vento BSVI in the next couple of months, before the April 2020 deadline.</p>
