      <p>Staff at McDonald's are set to strike on Tuesday to demand a higher hourly wage, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Last month, the Bakers Union called for a 'McStrike' on November 12, calling for staff to be paid £15-per-hour.</p>
      <p>According to employeebenefits.co.uk, the majority of McDonald's staff currently earn a maximum of between £9.50 and £11.75 an hour.</p>
      <p>The UK living wage is currently £9 per hour - with a higher rate of £10.55 in London, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/mcdonalds-workers-urged-go-strike-20727906">The Mirror</a> reports.</p>
      <p>As a result, staff across the country will take strike action tomorrow (Tuesday).</p>
      <p>Melissa Evans, 32, who works at the Wandsworth Town branch told Left Foot Forward: "I need £15 an hour so I can show my son that poverty is not the only option.</p>
      <p>"We are coming together to tackle poverty pay, insecurity of hours and lack of respect which has gone on at McDonald’s for too long."</p>
      <p>The union is also demanding the fast-food chain guarantees working hours of up to 40 hours a week and notice of shifts four weeks in advance.</p>

      <p>McDonald's said it offers 40-hour guaranteed contracts to the employers and 90 per cent of its 130,000 staff chose to remain on flexible contracts.</p>
      <p>The potential strike will struggle to get large-scale backing, with only a small number of Bakers Union members in a handful of restaurants.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the Bakers Union told The Sun: "Anyone can join up after the strike is called and join the action.</p>
      <p>"Each time McDonald's have tried to downplay the numbers involved. McDonald's claim they offer all staff guaranteed hours.</p>
      <p>"Many workers have never been offered that, you have to qualify for it, and it's still at the manager's discretion.</p>
      <p>"It doesn’t stand up to scrutiny. They are using it a smokescreen to cover up for the fact workers don't have the hours they need to put food on the table."</p>
      <p>A McDonald's spokesman said: "We are extremely disappointed that a very small number of our people in just a handful of our restaurants are considering industrial action.</p>
      <p>"It is encouraging that there has been a steady decrease in the already small numbers of our people previously balloted.</p>
      <p>"In October 2018, when activity was last planned, ultimately none of our people actually took action.</p>
      <p>"As a growing and successful organisation we, along with our franchisees, will continue to invest in our people and create quality jobs and opportunities for all.</p>
      <p>"We regularly review pay and benefits to ensure we are rewarding our people, and we pay well above the government minimum wage."</p>
