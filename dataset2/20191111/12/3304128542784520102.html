      <p>The Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT) has been closed indefinitely following the student unrest that was witnessed on Monday morning.</p>
      <p>In a memo issued on Monday by the University’s Acting Vice-Chancellor Robert Kinyua, the students were directed to vacate the University by 11.30 AM.</p>
      <p>“In a special meeting of the senate held today, Monday 11th November 2019 at 10.00 am, it was resolved that the university closes indefinitely, ” the memo reads in part.</p>
      <p>The memo comes a few hours after JKUAT students took to the streets to decry insecurity in the institution.</p>
      <p>The students led by President Clinton Osoro and Secretary General Bruce Akach engaged police in running battles accusing local Boda Boda operators of working with criminals to rob colleagues.</p>

      <p>This is the fourth institution to be closed indefinitely in the past two months.</p>
