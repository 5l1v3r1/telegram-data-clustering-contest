      <h1>Mum dying of cancer fighting to make Christmas as husband says she could die any time</h1>
      <h2>Mum of seven Helen Robinson could have just days, weeks or another month, but her family want to make the most of it</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T12:31:09+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 12:31</time> by <a rel="author">Kelly-Ann Mills, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>A terminally-ill mum is battling hard to survive and spend her last ever Christmas with her husband and young children.</p>
      <p>Helen Robinson has been given a devastating prognosis that has left her seven children and husband Stephen reeling.</p>
      <p>Stephen said his 46-year-old wife "could pass away within an hour, day, week or even another month" as he tries to make the most of the time she has left.</p>
      <p>Last week, friends and family celebrated Helen's life  at a well-attended and emotional evening at Tranmere Rovers' stadium Prenton Park, the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">Liverpool Echo</a> reports.</p>
      <p>Stephen said: "Helen is still with us, hanging on and fighting.</p>

      <p>"A driver, which is a tube which delivers drugs like morphine into her system, is masking things, and without it, she would truly be on her deathbed.</p>
      <p>"It means she's not in pain, but it doesn't make Helen's condition improve.</p>
      <p>"It just stops the personal suffering, and makes everything less of a battle."</p>
      <p>Helen beat breast cancer last year, but in recent months, her family feared something was wrong as she developed a cough which she was unable to shake off.</p>
      <p>In October, the mum, husband their three youngest children, Ellie, 13, Sophie, 10, and Jessica eight, celebrated an early Christmas with presents for all the kids.</p>
      <p>Stephen said he was now struggling to cope with his own emotions, and his youngsters were also finding it hard to process their mum, who has autism, will soon be taken from them.</p>
      <p>He added: "Helen is quite distressed.</p>

      <p>"She could have a day left, a week or a month, it'll just happen.</p>
      <p>"Helen's got down, sleepy and stressed by the whole situation.</p>
      <p>"But she's a fighter, always has been, and never once moaned through all of this.</p>
      <p>"I'm at the hospice every night - it's tough."</p>
      <p>Last month, Helen surprised her husband by appearing in a white wedding dress, which their children bought, so a priest could renew their vows.</p>
