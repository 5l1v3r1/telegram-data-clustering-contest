      <p>A hero cat pounced on a baby crawling towards a steep flight of stairs and saved him from falling down.</p>
      <p>Footage shot in a living room in Bogotá, Colombia, shows Siamese cat Gatubela leaping into action when one-year-old Samuel León heads towards the stairs.</p>
      <p>The baby, wearing a red bodysuit, makes his way past a cot and a rocking chair, while the cat keeps an eye on him.</p>
      <p>As Samuel continues to crawl across the living room, Gatubela moves closer to the edge of the sofa.</p>
      <p>When the one-year-old gets moves towards the edge of the room, the cat suddenly launches himself from his seat, trying to pull Samuel away from the steep stairs.</p>

      <p>The animal wraps its front paws across the toddler's body, forcing him to move backwards.</p>
      <p>Later, the pair can be seen playing in the room while the Siamese cat keeps an eye on Samuel.</p>
      <p>"The cat has been part of our family practically since birth, we had her here when she was a month, a month and a few days old, and she has become familiar with my children," said the father of the rescued toddler, Jesid Leon.</p>
      <p>"She is two months older than my son."</p>
      <p>The cat is named Gatubela, which translates to Catwoman, after the DC Comics character.</p>

      <p>"I was a short distance from him when I suddenly noticed that he had woken up and had left the crib by himself, for this reason I wanted to go back over the recordings so that I could see how he got out of his crib," she added.</p>
      <p>"It was at that moment that I discovered that the cat had saved his life. ‘If it had not been for the cat my son would have rolled down the stairs. Watching the footage, I felt really surprised and lucky."</p>

      <p>Brandon Hall commented: "For anyone that is confused, the cat is actually the babysitter."</p>
      <p>Rockit added: "When you see animals act like this, it shows they are happy in their family environment and want to protect it - that cat should get a LOT of praise and a good feed - and it would appreciate it."</p>
