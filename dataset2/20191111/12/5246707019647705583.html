      <p><b>Update (11th Nov, 12:00 GMT):</b> For some reason, the 'month' of Luigi (see below for more details) appears to be showing no signs of slowing down. A quick look at the @SuperMario_UK Twitter account reveals that Luigi's reign is still very much in effect despite the fact that we're now well and truly in November.</p>
      <p>The account has been posting daily facts about Luigi since the beginning of October, promising more throughout the month, but is still going strong eleven days later. The account's humour is still shining through, too. Here's 'Day 41' of Luigi's special month:</p>

      <p>When will it end? Will it <i>ever</i> end? Is Mario finished? Has someone made sure that the Nintendo social media team are OK? Has Luigi redefined what it means to be a month? <i>Amazing.</i></p>

      <p><b>Original Article (Fri 4th Oct, 2019 11:00 BST):</b> The month of October is now upon us and there are plenty of things for Nintendo fans to be excited about. Arguably one of the main reasons, of course, is the upcoming launch of <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/luigis_mansion_3"><b>Luigi's Mansion 3</b></a>, and Nintendo is celebrating in style.</p>
      <p>Remember <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2014/03/feature_looking_back_on_the_year_of_luigi">the Year of Luigi</a> a few years back? Well, for one month only, Nintendo has decided to once again celebrate all things green by dubbing October 2019 as 'Super Luigi Month'. The Super Mario UK Twitter account has been rebranded as Super Luigi UK until 31st October, the day of the new game's release; from now until then, the account will be "dedicated entirely to Luigi and his esteemed history". <i>As it should be</i>.</p>

      <p>Things have already begun, with one Luigi-themed message seemingly appearing per day. Here's what we've had so far:</p>
