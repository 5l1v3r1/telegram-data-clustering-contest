        <b>The deadliest show on TV strikes again</b>
      </p>
      <p>Wubba lubba dub dub! <a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/tv-blogs/rick-and-morty-season-4-release-date-plot-and-everything-we-know-so-far-2146711"><i>Rick and Morty</i></a> returned to US screens last night after two years away – and it didn’t disappoint. Dubbed the deadliest TV show currently streaming – its average of 26.1 deaths per episode outranks even <a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/tv-blogs/the-walking-dead-season-10-release-date-trailer-plot-cast-2444758"><i>The Walking Dead</i></a> – the show’s season four premiere more than lived up to its bloodthirsty reputation.</p>
      <p>Episode one, ‘Day After Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat’, was stuffed with violent stabbings, ruthless beatings and Nazi executions. Opening on a typical Smith family dinner – Rick has inserted a chip into his brain which allows him to browse Amazon and make small talk simultaneously – the premiere follows the eponymous duo as they travel the universe in search of death crystals.</p>

      <p>The crystals, which they locate almost immediately, allow the bearer to view all of the many scenarios in which they eventually die. It’s fairly standard <i>Rick and Morty</i> fare and could be taken from any of the previous three series.</p>
      <p>However, there’s a twist. After a bungled take-off, the pair crash their ship and Rick is impaled on a giant stalagmite. Of course, the mad scientist has a “crisis detection and correction protocol” in place, so accidental death isn’t as permanent as that sounds. But while holding the death crystal, Morty glimpses a future in which he ends up with high school crush Jessica. Obsessed with realising this dream, he refuses to bring Rick back to life for fear of altering that reality.</p>

      <p>What follows is a wacky adventure across multiple dimensions, with Rick inserting his digital footprint into successive cloning facilities which belong to different Ricks from other worlds. Unfortunately for him, most of those worlds are ruled by neo-Nazis or giant wasps. More deaths follow, with neither Rick nor Morty managing to escape the Grim Reaper’s scythe.</p>

      <p>As mentioned previously, a massive 808 deaths were recorded across <i>Rick and Morty</i>’s first three seasons. But even by those brutal standards, ‘Day After Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat’ was particularly ruthless.
