      <h1>Nigel Farage's Brexit Party won't contest Conservatives seats at general election</h1>
      <h2>Mr Farage said he would be focusing the Brexit Party's efforts on Labour-held seats</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T12:25:51+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 12:25</time> by <a rel="author">James Rodger, https://www.facebook.com/jamesrodgerjournalist</a></address>
      <p>Nigel Farage has said the Brexit Party will not contest the 317 seats won by the Conservatives at the last general election.</p>
      <p>Mr Farage said he would be focusing the Brexit Party's efforts on Labour-held seats.</p>
      <p>"I will tell you now exactly what we are going to do," he told supporters in Hartlepool.</p>
      <p>"The Brexit Party will not contest the 317 seats the Conservatives won at the last election.</p>
      <p>"But what we will do is concentrate our total effort into all the seats that are held by the Labour Party, who have completely broken their manifesto pledge in 2017 to respect the result of the referendum.</p>
      <p>"And we will also take on the rest of the Remainer parties. We will stand up and we will fight them all."</p>

      <p>Farage finally backed down to his own party after he faced fury for keeping up the threat to stand 600 candidates.</p>
      <p>Allies of Farage and of Boris Johnson were in secretive last-minute talks over the weekend to try to strike a 'Leave Alliance' ahead of Thursday's 4pm cut-off for candidate nominations.</p>
      <p>But Farage had been standing by his threat to stand 600 Brexit Party candidates - while Boris Johnson refused to formally give ground.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Farage's long time ally Arron Banks had claimed standing 600 candidates could "split the vote so badly it could open the door of 10 Downing Street to Jeremy Corbyn ". He added: "It is time for Nigel and his supporters to be realistic."</p>
      <p>Farage originally demanded Boris Johnson "renounce" his Withdrawal Agreement to save facing the Brexit Party in 600 seats across the country.</p>
      <p>Days later he watered down the threat after it prompted a massive backlash and some Brexit Party candidates quit.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Instead he demanded changes to the Political Declaration, to rule out an extension of the transition period beyond 2020, or a future trade deal that has "regulatory alignment" with the EU.</p>
