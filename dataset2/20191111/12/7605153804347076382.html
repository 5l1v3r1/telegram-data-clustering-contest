        <b>PARIS, France, Nov 11<i> – </i>Defending champions Manchester City have become the latest English Premier League club that could not contain irresistible Liverpool attackers Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mane scored his seventh league goal this season and Salah his sixth as the Reds overcame the champions 3-1 at Anfield to take an eight-point lead 12 rounds into the season.</p>
      <p>The dynamic duo now adjust their sights to 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying with Senegalese Mane confronting Congo Brazzaville and Egyptian Salah taking on Kenya this week.</p>
      <p>
        <b>ENGLAND</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>MOHAMED SALAH (Liverpool)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Headed home Liverpool’s second — from a pinpoint cross by Andrew Robertson — early on to leave Manchester City rocking.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old is a nemesis for most clubs, but he has a special knack against City at Anfield, scoring for the third time in four home league games against Pep Guardiola’s outfit.</p>
      <p>
        <b>SADIO MANE (Liverpool)</b>
      </p>
      <p>He is even outstripping Salah in the scoring stakes when it comes to goals at Anfield, or any other Premier League player since August 2018.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old forward’s header for the third of Liverpool’s goals was his 22nd at home in that period.</p>
      <p>
        <b>MAHMOUD ‘TREZEGUET’ HASSAN (Aston Villa)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Was one of Villa’s rare bright lights in a disappointing 2-1 loss to midlands rivals Wolverhampton Wanderers.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old Egyptian caused the Wolves defence some concerns down his flank and deservedly got on the score sheet in stoppage time.</p>
      <p>
        <b>WILFRED NDIDI (Leicester)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gave an assured performance in midfield for the high-flying 2016 champions in the impressive 2-0 win over Arsenal.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old Nigerian came close to scoring in the second half with his shot from outside the area beating the goalkeeper but cannoning off the bar.</p>
      <p>
        <b>SPAIN</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>YOUSSEF EN-NESYRI (Leganes)</b>
      </p>
      <p>En-Nesyri earned bottom La Liga club Leganes a morale-boosting 1-1 draw by scoring a late equaliser against high-flying Real Sociedad.</p>
      <p>The Moroccan striker rose to head home in the 78th minute after Mikel Merino had given the Basque outfit the lead.</p>
      <p>
        <b>ITALY</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>OMAR COLLEY (Sampdoria)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gambia defender Colley has proved central to new coach Claudio Ranieri’s plans for Sampdoria.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old was solid as the Genoa side went a second straight game without conceding a goal for the first time this season by drawing 0-0 at home against Atalanta.</p>
      <p>“When you build a house, you do it from the ground up, and accordingly with the defence,” said Ranieri.</p>
      <p>
        <b>KHOUMA BABACAR (Lecce)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Senegalese striker Babacar missed a penalty which would have pulled promoted Lecce level at 2-2 against Lazio.</p>
      <p>It was the second time this season the on-loan Sassuolo player missed from the spot. Lecce fell 4-2 to sit just a point above the relegation zone.</p>
      <p>
        <b>KALIDOU KOULIBALY (Napoli)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Senegal defender Koulibaly made a decisive goal-line clearance on the hour to deny Genoa a goal as 2018/2019 Serie A runners-up Napoli settled for a 0-0 draw at home — their fourth league game without a win.</p>
      <p>
        <b>FRANCK KESSIE (AC Milan)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kessie was dropped for a second straight match as struggling Milan fell 1-0 at Juventus.</p>
      <p>The Ivory Coast international has reportedly fallen out with new coach Stefano Pioli for turning up late to training and giving under-par performances.</p>
      <p>Milan Director of football Frederic Massara insisted: “This is simply a technical choice… we are convinced that Franck will soon be able to return to the player that we know.”</p>

      <p>
        <b>ACHRAF HAKIMI (Borussia Dortmund)</b>
      </p>
      <p>After his two stunning goals in midweek inspired a fightback win over Inter Milan, the Morocco right-back struggled as Dortmund were thumped 4-0 at Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga.</p>
      <p>Hakimi, who was fantastic in inspiring the 3-2 win over Inter, left Robert Lewandowski unmarked to head home the hosts’ first goal and was out of position for their second by Serge Gnabry in a poor display by Dortmund’s back four.</p>
      <p>
        <b>FRANCE</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>DENIS BOUANGA (Saint-Etienne)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Gabon winger scored the match-winner for Saint-Etienne in a 3-2 victory at Nantes after equalising earlier. Bouanga has netted five goals in 13 Ligue 1 appearances this season.</p>
      <p>
        <b>LEBO MOTHIBA (Strasbourg)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mothiba ended a five-month goal drought by bagging a brace as Strasbourg romped to a 4-1 home win over Nimes. The South African forward scored in each half for his first Ligue 1 goals since May.</p>
