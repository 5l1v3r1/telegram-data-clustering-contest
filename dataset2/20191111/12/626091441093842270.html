      <h1>YouTube Says it Has 'No Obligation' To Host Anyone's Video</h1>

      <p>Speaking of <a href="https://news.slashdot.org/story/19/11/10/2026240/youtubes-moderation-questioned-after-banning-accounts-for-too-many-emojis">YouTube and moderation</a>, the Google-owned video service is rolling out updated terms of service on December 10th, and a new line acts as a reminder that the company doesn't have to keep any video up that it doesn't want to. From a report:<i> "<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/11/20955864/youtube-terms-of-service-update-terminations-children-content-ftc">YouTube is under no obligation to host or serve content</a>," the new terms of service policy reads. It's another way of saying that just because YouTube is a relatively open platform, it doesn't mean that the company is required to keep videos up. YouTube has faced criticism from all sides over its video removal process. Some critics argue that YouTube could do more to take down videos that butt up against the company's rules but don't outright violate them; others argue that YouTube ought to be a fully open platform and shouldn't control what remains up and what doesn't. Executives have long defended the platform as a champion of free speech, but have started to clamp down on the type of videos allowed to circulate.</i></p>
