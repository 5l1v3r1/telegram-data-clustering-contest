      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kareena-Kapoor">Kareena Kapoor</a> Khan is considered to be one of the fittest actresses of Bollywood. She is the one who introduced the 'size zero' concept to Bollywood and also went on to inspire many with her post-pregnancy make-over. From being a perfect supermom to juggling with her professional commitments, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kareena-Kapoor">Bebo</a> has been the masters of all. Kareena is not active on social media and we know fans are eagerly waiting for the day to arrive. However, we usually stumble upon some interesting updates on Kareena which are shared by her fan-made page on Instagram.</p>
      <p>Today, a picture of Bebo enjoying some delicious tradition food has gone viral on the internet. The picture sees Bebo enjoying '<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sarson-da-saag">Sarson da saag</a>'. The picture has the caption which reads, "The joy of eating desi -</p>
      <p>Every region has its own tradition of celebrating its seasonal produce using timeless, heritage recipes. And i strongly believe that one should follow a diet that respects that versus that which makes you feel like you have “cheated” if you eat a seasonal delicacy.Changing the roti, sabzi and the accompaniments as the season changes, is something that we must cherish. Nutrition societies across the globe are trying to adopt this practice from ancient cultures. And on our part, we must ensure that this timeless practice is not forgotten and lost in the process of eating only meat or only soup-salad or not eating at all.Health is not a size, it’s a state. A state of harmony, in the mind and body and between people and planet. And really, all you need to do for that is to keep calm and eat makhan-roti-saag.P.S- - Makhan-roti-saag coz right now is in Punjab.- This is for dinner. The Makhan, saag and roti and the quantities in the picture do NOT depict how much she eats. The pic is taken after most of it is in her stomach. Eat as per your hunger, not as per a fixed measure.- Mein apni favourite hu is not just a dialogue, it’s a way of life that encourages you to eat all that is nice."</p>
