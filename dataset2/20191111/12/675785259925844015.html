      <h2>Liverpool moved nine points clear of the champions with a 3-1 win at Anfield on Sunday, but summer signing Rodri insists City won't go down without a fight</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T12:17:45+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 12:17</time> by <a rel="author">John Cross, https://www.facebook.com/johncrossmirror/</a></address>
      <p>Spain midfielder Rodri insists <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> will not give up their Premier League title without a fight.</p>
      <p>Pep Guardiola’s reigning champions are nine points behind runaway leaders <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> after their showdown at Anfield and they have got a mountain to climb.</p>
      <p>But Rodri says they will keep battling until the end and believes they have got enough fight and determination in the squad to catch Liverpool as he promised their challenge is not over.</p>
      <p>City star Rodri said: “Absolutely not [the Premier League isn't over]. This team has shown it many times before.</p>
      <p>“This team has won the Premier League two seasons in a row and that isn't a coincidence. This team has earnt the respect and being considered for the title race.</p>

      <p>“Last season, the team was seven points behind and it could have been ten in case of losing, and they managed to win the league in the end. We are in November. There is still a lot left.</p>
      <p>“They [Liverpool] are very strong at the moment and they are having everything right. Let's see what happens in the future.</p>
      <p>“It's a nine point gap with them now, but there is still seven months of the season ahead. We are the current champions and we are not going to give up.”</p>

      <p>Rodri also claims that City must learn valuable lessons from their defeat at Anfield if they are to come back in the title race but also insisted they were better than Liverpool.</p>
      <p>He said: “Obviously, when you lose, you are not happy. We have to improve some things, we need to be more clinical in the boxes.</p>
      <p>“They were more clinical than us, I think that was the key factor. I think we were much better overall, we created more chances than them, but they arrive to our goal three times and scored three goals.</p>

      <p>“We left with a bittersweet feeling, because we wanted to win. It couldn't happen in the end. We are far from them now, but there is still a big part of the season left.</p>
      <p>“We are not going to give up. We are the current champions and we are not going to make it easy for anyone.”</p>
      <p>City left back Angelino added: “We created chances, we had opportunities to get back into the game, but unluckily, we couldn't make it today. It was a strong game for the team, great performance, everyone worked really hard. That's what matters to me.</p>
      <p>“We need to keep the same spirit and the same attitude for the next games.</p>
      <p>"We played really well, we have created many chances, we have only conceded three chances to Liverpool, but against a team like them, if you give them a chance, they take advantage of it.</p>
      <p>“We have had more chances than them but, at the end of the day, we didn't use them.</p>
      <p>"We are happy for the way we played, I think the whole team fought until the end, we gave everything and if we keep playing like today in this stadium, we can achieve great things.”</p>
