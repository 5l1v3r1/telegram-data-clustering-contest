        <b>ATK's star Fijian striker Roy Krisha, who scored the two crucial penalties against Jamshedpur on Saturday, has credited the whole team for the 3-1 win in Kolkata. Meanwhile, Jamshedpur's Sergio Castel, who scored the consolation penalty goal, has admitted that ATK were the better team.</b>
      </p>
      <p>ATK beat Jamshedpur 3-1 to rise to the top of the table at the Salt Lake Stadium in Kolkata on Saturday. The Kolkatan team overcame the harsh weather conditions and the physical game of Jamshedpur to win the match. Fijian striker Roy Krishna converted the two penalties while Edu Garcia came off the bench to score the final goal. Meanwhile, Jamshedpur FC found the consolation goal from Spaniard Sergio Castel's penalty.</p>
      <p>The former Australian A-League top scorer now has three goals from four games for ATK. He was lively against a strong Jamshedpur and easily converted the penalties he got. Jamshedpur defenders had a hard time to control Roy and the men of steel eventually paid the price.</p>
      <p>The Fijian striker is happy to get the three points, however, he credits his whole team for the win. “Yeah, as a striker, you need to score goals. I just did my part, but credit goes to the team. We defended and attacked well. So, the credit goes to the whole team. We dug deep… We knew it was going to be a physical game. They are a good side and they are on top for a reason so I’m happy with the three points and now we have a good break so I’m looking forward to the break.” said Roy Krishna, at the post-match conference, ISL website reported.</p>
      <p>Roy also spoke about the banter with Jamshedpur custodian <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/player/subrata_paul">Subrata Paul</a> before the second penalty. “Well, it’s a tactic most goalkeepers employ. What is more important is that we got three points. I’m happy with the team and all credits go to them.” Roy added.</p>
      <p>The two-time champions ATK are now top of the table with nine points in four games. Roy also thinks that the international break will help ATK. “ I think confidence was really high. I think the coach was very particular that we get the three points this week. Credit goes to the team. We defended well and at times we could be better. Like I said, this break will help us. Very happy about all the fans who came today. Not the best weather but thanks to all the fans who came to support us today.” concluded Roy Krishna</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Jamshedpur's <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/atletico_madrid">Atletico Madrid</a> B loanee, who scored the consolation penalty for the men of steel in the second half, has admitted that ATK were the better team. </p>
      <p>“It’s a tough loss. We played our best but they were better than us. We can lose a game. They played better and I think it’s fair for them to win.” said Castel in the post-match interview.</p>
      <p>Sergio Castel who has now three goals is the joint top scorer this season also spoke about the harsh rainy weather that impacted the match.</p>
      <p>“ It was a tough game because it was raining a lot. The pitch was very heavy. It was a different game. We couldn’t play our style of possession football. We tried long balls today. They did as well but they did it better.” Sergio Castel concluded.</p>
