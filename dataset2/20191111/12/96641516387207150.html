      <h1>Engadget's 2019 holiday gift guide is here!</h1>
      <h2>We have over 150 picks, with even more gift ideas rolling out throughout the week.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T12:00:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.engadget.com/editors/dana-wollman" target="_blank">Dana Wollman</a></address>
      <p>Somehow, it's November. Mid-November. Which means while you might just be gearing up to begin your holiday shopping, we're already done. At least, we're done shopping for <i>you</i>. After months of thinking, curating, photographing, more thinking, we've come up with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/holiday-gift-guide-2019/">a holiday gift guide</a> that covers all the bases (and budgets), from laptops and mobile devices, to toys, to the smart home, to book and media recommendations (only on nerdy subjects, of course). All told, there are more than 150 items in our guide, spanning 13 categories, with advice from 25 of our writers and editors. You know, the people testing and reviewing this stuff all year long.</p>
      <p>And we're not done yet: We have additional picks and buying advice coming throughout this week, including gifts for coffee geeks, shopping for hypebeasts and our favorite wireless earbuds. (Because we expect those to be popular stocking stuffers this year.) To start, we have a guide to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/11/best-nintendo-switch-and-switch-lite-accessories/">the best Switch and Switch Lite accessories</a>. The Switch and Switch Lite itself made our list, too, but in the event your intended already has one, perhaps they could use a more functional d-pad controller? Our staff thinks so.</p>
