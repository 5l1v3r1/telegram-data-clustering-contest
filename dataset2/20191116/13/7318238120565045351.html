      <p>A special festival celebrating the relationship between humans and elephants has been taking place in Thailand.</p>
      <p>It's been held in the south-east province of Surin since the 1960s.</p>
      <p>Elephant twins Tong Kham and Tong Tang led a parade and cultural displays of traditional dance entertained onlookers.</p>
      <p>The jumbos then fed on 50 tonnes of fruit on a 400-metre-long table.</p>
      <p>Over 160 elephants will put on performances in the Elephant Round-Up shows this weekend along with over 1,000 performers at Surin Elephant Show Stadium.</p>
