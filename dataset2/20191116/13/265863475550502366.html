      <p>A follower said that this is ‘well deserved. people forget she came from nothing and worked VERY hard for the co-sign by Wayne and everything else she deserved that God gave her. ♥️ very important for black women &amp; women in general. knowing the GP, she’ll get overlooked in their eyes because she’s dominating and changing the music industry by fighting for streaming rights, certifications, and just being the groundbreaker for women in the industry.’</p>
      <p>One fan posted: ‘I’m sure she’s showing up for That 😒 congratulations 🎉 Onika.’</p>
      <p>Another commenter wrote: ‘Thank GOD. Giving a Legend her flowers while she can smell them🐐🙏🏽🙏🏽— Others were gloating about musty bet accolades. Thank you BILLBOARD. Where it counts. HITS 👑’</p>
      <p>Someone else said: ‘There’s room for everybody to win …she deserves it 💕.our race so messed up from slavery that we feel competition is validation of who’s better. When God created us different, and each rapper feeds us all something different through their music. But she deserves it 💪🏾💪🏾❣️’</p>
      <p>In other news, not too long ago, <a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/nicki-minaj-addresses-instagram-hiding-users-likes-see-the-clips-339455/">Nicki talked about Instagram’s latest plan</a> on her social media account.</p>
      <p>The social media giant plans to hide users’ likes in the US, and the rapper has something to say about this.</p>
      <p>Other than this, Nicki is living her best life together with Kenneth Petty whom she married recently.</p>
