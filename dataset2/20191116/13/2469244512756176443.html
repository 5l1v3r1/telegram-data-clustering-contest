      <p>Highways England has issued a warning to motorists on the <a href="https://www.devonlive.com/all-about/m5">M5</a> after cars were spotted driving through cones to escape heavy traffic.</p>
      <p>Two crashes on the M5 are causing long delays this morning, with some drivers having been held up for several hours.</p>
      <p>But Highways England took to Twitter to warn motorists that driving through the cones was illegal and puts people at risk.</p>
      <p>In the Tweet they shared the picture below and said: "This action is ILLEGAL!</p>
      <p>"You are putting yourselves, our road workers and other road users at great risk!</p>

      <p>"The traffic has now been released, we ask for your patience during these stoppages."</p>
      <p>A serious crash around 6am this morning has left a woman in hospital with serious head injuries.</p>
      <p>The collision, which involved a car and a lorry, happened on the M5 Southbound carriageway between junctions 22 and 23.</p>

      <p>It is understood the A38 is also affected as traffic diverts onto the main road to avoid the motorway closure.</p>
      <p>A second crash around an hour ago left a car on its roof on the M5 Northdbound between Junctions 18 and 17.</p>
      <p>The road was blocked and traffic was stropped while police, fire and ambulance crews made their way to the scene.</p>
