      <p>As the weather improves many people will be heading off into the great outdoors.</p>
      <p>Taupo Police would like remind people to be prepared and notify people of their plans.</p>
      <p>Two people had to be rescued late yesterday afternoon, one from deep within the Kaimanawa Forest Park and the other off Mount Tauhara, east of Taupo.</p>
      <p>The Greenlea Rescue Helicopter was tasked by Taupo Police to rescue both people within 45 minutes of each other.</p>
      <p>In both cases they got lost and night was approaching.</p>
      <p>As more people take to our mountain and bush tracks this season the best way to do this is through proper preparation.</p>
      <p>Whether it's a multi-day tramp or a day walk, remember to plan your trip, prepare for all conditions, properly equip yourself, tell someone about it and most importantly - stick to your plans.</p>
      <p>Remember:</p>
      <p>• Plan your trip: seek local advice and knowledge if you are unfamiliar with terrain and conditions, and thoroughly plan your route before heading out.<br/>• <br/>• Tell someone where you are going, and let them know when to raise the alarm if you don’t return.<br/>• <br/>• Beware of the weather: our weather is very unpredictable and can deteriorate quickly.<br/>• <br/>Check the forecast and expect weather changes.</p>
      <p>• Know your limits: don’t push your physical limits and experience in unfamiliar or dangerous terrain.<br/>• <br/>• Take the right supplies and equipment: make sure you have the right clothing for the conditions, and emergency rations for the worst case scenario.<br/>• <br/>Take appropriate means of communication.</p>
      <p>• Think: if you get into trouble, can you call for help? Who knows where you are? Do you have the clothing, food and equipment to stay safe until help arrives?<br/>• <br/>More information about staying safe in the great outdoors can be found at the Mountain Safety Council website - <a href="http://mountainsafety.org.nz/">mountainsafety.org.nz</a> or <a href="http://adventuresmart.org.nz/">adventuresmart.org.nz</a>.</p>
