      <p>Generally, polling units in Yenagoa opened early amidst tight security.</p>
      <p>Electoral officials were at their duty posts on time within the metropolis, which is the local government with the largest voting population.</p>
      <p>The polling units visited at Amarata, Ovom, and Oppolo areas opened as early as 8 am but had to wait for the arrival of materials from the Registration Area Centre (RAC) in Yenagoa.</p>
      <p>At Oppolo, Tare Peters, a voter at polling unit 6, ward 2 said that the polling unit opened as early as 8 a.m.</p>
      <p>She said: “The election started early today and materials arrived early and we are waiting to vote already while the atmosphere remains very peaceful.”</p>
      <p>There was heavy security presence around the capital.</p>
      <p>Soldiers, with their patrol vehicles, maintained presence at strategic checkpoints.</p>
      <p>Police and civil defence officers also kept a watchful eye on proceedings at the polling units visited as voting and accreditation were going on simultaneously.</p>
