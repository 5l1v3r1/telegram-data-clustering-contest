      <p>Kwese TV presenter, Andrea Owusu- known within the entertainment world as Efia Odo has added another layer of suspense to her relationship with Shatta Wale in a fresh interview.</p>
      <p>After years of evading the question as to whether she sleeps with the multiple award winning artist, the TV personality has finally admitted she does, but only in her mind.</p>
      <p>When Pulse Ghana asked her in an interview if she’s sleeping with Shatta Wale, she replied, “Of course I am, in my mind. No, I’m not.”</p>
      <p>“We’re just friends, guys. I sleep with him in my mind because he’s just a great guy.”</p>
      <p>The host asked for clarification on whether both are friends with benefits and she said “no benefits, just friends. In my mind there are benefits.”</p>
      <p>On the other hand,<a href="https://www.ghbase.com/i-dont-chase-nigerian-other-international-artists-like-sarkodie-co-they-come-to-me-themselves-shatta-wale/"> Shatta Wale</a> subtly admitted on Paul Adom Otchere’s Good Evening Ghana programme that he had had his way with Efia Odo, few weeks ago in an interview.</p>
