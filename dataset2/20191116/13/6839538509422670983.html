      <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has just been dethroned as the wealthiest person in the world. Can you guess which billionaire is now number one?</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/16/bill-gates-regains-spot-as-worlds-richest-person/"><i>New York Post </i></a>reports that Mr Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, has a net worth of $US110 billion ($A162 billion), which topped Mr Bezos’ total worth of $US109 billion ($160 billion), according to the index.</p>

      <p>Mr Gates briefly held the top spot last month after Amazon suffered a 28 per cent drop in profits the three months ending in September, but quickly lost the spot again to Mr Bezos, CNN reported.</p>
      <p>Mr Gates’ ascent to the top spot was spurred by a 48 per cent increase in Microsoft shares, which lifted his net worth, according to CNN.</p>

      <p>Mr Bezos’ wealth was also impacted by his divorce settlement with his former wife MacKenzie.</p>
      <p>Their divorce settlement left her with 19.7 million shares of Amazon.com valued at more than $38 billion, according to Bloomberg.</p>
