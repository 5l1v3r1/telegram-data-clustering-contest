      <h1>ESPN’s Computer Is Predicting A Major Top 10 Upset Today</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T13:11:14+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 13:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Week 12 of the 2019 college football regular season has arrived, as several key games are set to kick off in a couple of hours. Will we be getting any upsets today?</p>
      <p>ESPN’s Football Power Index seems to think so.</p>
      <p>The Worldwide Leader’s computer is predicting a big-time top 10 upset that would affect the College Football Playoff race today.</p>
      <p>Minnesota jumped up to No. 8 in the College Football Playoff rankings following last week’s big win at home over Penn State. The Golden Gophers are 9-0 on the season. The Big Ten West contenders are right in the thick of the playoff race.</p>
      <p>ESPN’s Football Power Index has P.J. Fleck’s team losing today, though.</p>
      <h3>ESPN’s computer model is predicting No. 20 Iowa to upset No. 8 Minnesota on Saturday. The FPI is giving the Hawkeyes a 60.8 percent chance of winning, giving the Golden Gophers just a 39.2 percent chance of winning.</h3>
      <p>A loss would certainly hurt Minnesota’s College Football Playoff chances, though the Golden Gophers wouldn’t be eliminated from contention with a loss.</p>
      <p>Minnesota and Iowa are set to kick off at 4 p.m. E.T. on FOX.</p>
