      <ul>
        <li>Disney+ is already struggling with keeping its users' info safe, as thousands of accounts have been posted online in hacker forums and on Reddit. </li>
        <li>Tech news site ZDNet detailed several complaints against the company on Twitter after people were locked out of their accounts. </li>
        <li>"Not even been half of a week and my dad's Disney+ account has ALREADY been hacked," <a href="https://twitter.com/CommandrBlitzer/status/1195427748057174017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1195427748057174017&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zdnet.com%2Farticle%2Fthousands-of-hacked-disney-accounts-are-already-for-sale-on-hacking-forums%2F">reads one tweet from an angry subscriber</a>. </li>

      <p>At least the shows are good.</p>
      <p>Disney+, the streaming service launched earlier this week by the massive media conglomerate, began its offering with technical difficulties after the volume of subscribers was higher than the company expected.</p>
      <p>Now, less than a week after the service began running, users are being locked out of their accounts because hackers have cracked their passwords and shared the info online.</p>
      <p>Tech news publication ZDNet <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/thousands-of-hacked-disney-accounts-are-already-for-sale-on-hacking-forums/">found several instances of subscribers</a> complaining online about being locked out and Disney's lack of security for their account info. </p>

      <p>Reddit and other online forums have been filled with hackers giving Disney+ account information away for free or selling someone else's account, ZDNet found. The tech-focused website said some were up for sale mere hours after the launch of the streaming service.</p>
      <p>The service costs $7 a month, but is being sold in hacker forums for anywhere from $3 to $11, ZDNet reported. </p>
      <p>"However, in our search for ads on various hacking forums, we also came across several lists of Disney+ account credentials being offered for free, to be shared and used by the hacker community (Disney+ allows account sharing)," ZDNet reported.</p>
      <p>Disney did not immediately return requests for comment. </p>
      <p>The company's new service has already attracted a ton of news users, with new series, like "Star Wars" spinoff "The Mandalorian, and old favorites, like Pixar's many well-known movies. The streaming service <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/disney-plus-has-10-million-sign-ups-since-launch-subscribers-2019-11">had 10 million sign-ups the day after launching</a>, the company announced on Wednesday, despite the technical setbacks, boosting the company's stock price.</p>
      <p>For comparison, Netflix has more than 150 million global subscribers while Hulu has 28 million. </p>
