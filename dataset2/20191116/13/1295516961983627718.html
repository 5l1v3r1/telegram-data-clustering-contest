      <h1>Justice League: Snyder Shares Frame from Cut Cyborg vs Steppenwolf Scene</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T13:11:49+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 13:11</time> by <a rel="author">L.D. Nolan</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/justice-league-film/">Justice League</a> director Zack Snyder has released a new still showing a cut confrontation between Victor Stone/Cyborg and Steppenwolf.</p>
      <p>Snyder posted the following picture of Cyborg standing between his father and Steppenwolf to <a href="https://vero.co/zacksnyder/CQf-5KfDVMHwvgm4x8wqCGNG">Vero</a>. In Snyder's cut of the film, <a href="https://screenrant.com/justice-league-reshoots-cyborg-changes-father/">Steppenwolf killed Silas</a>, though the character survived in the theatrical release, as a lot of content relating to Cyborg didn't make that version of the movie. Snyder captioned the photo, "Defending the father."</p>

      <p>The production process for <i>Justice League </i>was infamously troubled, and the movie ultimately failed to meet expectations at the box office. After Snyder left <i>Justice League </i>following a family tragedy, director Joss Whedon was called in to complete reshoots that reportedly gave the film a lighter tone. Rumors of a Snyder Cut of <i>Justice League </i>quickly began gaining traction online, and several people involved with the production, including Snyder himself, have publicly discussed that version of the movie.</p>
