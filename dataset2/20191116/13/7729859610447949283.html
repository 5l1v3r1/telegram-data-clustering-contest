        <b>Moise Kean's father claims the striker's transfer to Everton was a "mistake" and he wants him to return to Italy as soon as possible.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Italy under-21 international moved to Goodison Park in a £27m transfer in the summer, but Kean's father Jean believes the 19-year-old is unhappy on Merseyside and should return to Serie A as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>The striker has struggled to feature under Everton boss Marco Silva, making just nine appearances and failing to score a single goal for the Toffees.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Centro Suono Sport Kean senior, said: 'Sending my son to England was a mistake, because he's still too young, he's not feeling good at Everton, I didn't like this transfer.</p>
      <p>"I hope he can come back to Italy as soon as possible, I hope he goes to Rome, but the important thing is that he comes back here."</p>
      <p>Jean has also hit out at super-agent Mino Raiola who handles his son's affairs, saying: "I don't have a relationship with Raiola, I have never met him, I don't think he even wants to see me.</p>

      <p>"He demanded my son's power of attorney when he was 14 and together with my ex-wife he wanted to take him to England.</p>
      <p>"At Everton, where he is playing now, he is not settling in well. I think he was supposed to wait a few more years before he had an experience abroad.</p>
      <p>"If there is a possibility for him to come back to Italy, I hope he can do that, so as not to ruin him."</p>

      <p>Jean also claims Juventus still owe him two tractors from a deal they made with him when they signed his son as a 14-year-old.</p>
      <p>"The story of the tractors? I believe in God and I believe in promises," he added.</p>
      <p>"But if their word was a lie I can't trust them anymore. They promised me two tractors and they still haven't been given to me."</p>
