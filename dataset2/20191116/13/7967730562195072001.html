      <h1>Palm Island death lawyers may take case of Central Australian man allegedly killed by police</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T13:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Zach Hope</a></address>
      <p>The lawyer who represented the family of an Aboriginal man who died in custody on Palm Island may take up the case of the man allegedly shot dead by a Northern Territory police officer last weekend.</p>
      <p>Lawyer Andrew Boe travelled to Yuendumu at the weekend to meet with elders of Yuendumu, about 300 kilometres north-west of Alice Springs, following the fatal police shooting of Kumanjayi Walker last Saturday night.</p>
      <p>Mr Boe previously worked for the family of Mulrunji Doomadgee, who died in the custody of Queensland police in 2004.</p>
      <p>Later, in 2018, law firm Levitt Robinson successfully won $30 million in compensation against the Queensland government after the Federal Court agreed the Racial Discrimination Act had been breached in connection to the death on Palm Island.</p>

      <p>The class action followed the flawed internal police investigation into the death in custody of Mulrunji Doomadgee in 2004 and subsequent community-wide riots.</p>
      <p>The potential for legal action over the death in Yuendumu comes a week after Kumanjayi Walker was shot and killed by police who were trying to arrest him for breaches of his suspended sentence and property offences.</p>

      <p><i>The Sunday Age</i> and <i>The </i><i>Sun-Herald</i> has seen information from sources close to Mr Boe that he is among a team of lawyers looking closely at circumstances surrounding the death.</p>
      <p>Constable Zachary Rolfe, 28, a decorated police officer who won a bravery award when he rescued drowning tourists, is expected to fight the murder charge laid against him on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>Last Sunday, police in Darwin told reporters Kumanjayi had lunged at officers with a weapon.</p>
      <p>A GoFundme campaign to raise money for legal action over Kumanjayi's death had raised more than $75,000 by Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Senior Warlpiri man Eddie Robertson told <i>The Sunday Age</i> and <i>The Sun-Herald</i> his adopted grandson knew he was going to be arrested by police in Yuendumu after he cut his electronic monitoring bracelet and fled court-ordered rehabilitation in Alice Springs to attend his uncle's funeral.</p>

      <p>"He was just wanting to go to the funeral and they were going to arrest him (after) and take him back to prison. He knew that," Mr Robertson said.</p>
      <p>On the Wednesday before his death, according to family, police came to the home where Kumanjayi was staying but were blocked at the door by his 18-year-old partner Rikisha Robertson.</p>
      <p>Lottie Robertson, Rikisha's grandmother, said Kumanjayi grabbed an axe or tomahawk and waved it at police to scare them away from the door so he could flee.</p>
      <p>"He didn't want to hurt anyone, he just wanted to get away," Mrs Robertson said.</p>
      <p>Mr Robertson said Kumanjayi threw the axe away and ran into the bush, where police gave up the chase.</p>
      <p>The family said after that incident police had agreed to hold off making the arrest until the day after the funeral or on Monday.</p>
      <p>Instead, Mrs Robertson said, officers brought in from Alice Springs raided the home where Kumanjayi was staying.</p>
      <p>"My daughter in-law rang me and said they heard shots," she said. "We got in the car and drove real fast. I was cry, cry all the way home. But it was too late. We could see all the police with lights and sirens going back to the police station."</p>
      <p>She said her son, who was at home during part of the funeral, had earlier witnessed an officer walking around to empty homes holding a gun.</p>
      <p>The incident has triggered a wave of grief, anger and fear in Yuendumu and surrounding communities, which spread from the Central Australian desert and turned into rallies in Australia's major cities.</p>
      <p>At least 1000 people rallied in Alice Springs on Thursday to demand justice and a fundamental change to the way services, including policing, are delivered in remote Aboriginal communities.</p>
      <p>Family and Yuendumu elders say Kumanjayi Walker could have been any number of young Aboriginal people from any number of remote Aboriginal communities.</p>
      <p>"We are just simple Aboriginal people practising our own culture, trying to teach our young people how to live and survive in this world. But we are targets. We are sitting ducks," Mrs Robertson says.</p>
      <p>"Especially the young people ... police identify them as criminals. This young fella was just 19. They've taken his life and broken the heart of my granddaughter, who is just 18."</p>

      <p>Kumanjayi, who was born in the remote community of Haasts Bluff, began petrol sniffing when he was still a little boy, his family says.</p>
      <p>Eddie and Lottie adopted him after his father left the community and his natural mother passed away and he met Rikisha, the "love of his life" at the Mount Theo outstation in 2015.</p>
      <p>Mrs Robertson, who worked with children aged 0-5 in the 1980s and '90s, said Kumanjayi showed the signs of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder, a cognitive impairment suffered by children whose mothers consumed alcohol while pregnant.</p>
      <p>Kumanjayi's family say he developed a reputation as a petty thief, only some of which was earned, and was often blamed for community break-ins even when they were committed by other young people.</p>
      <p>"He was really loved by our children and our granddaughters. To me he was a son," Mrs Robertson said.</p>
      <p>"He was polite. He had manners. And kind. But you know every time, police would always be after him. He could be blamed when the other kids did it. Always on the run. Always on the run."</p>
      <p>She said Kumanjayi was arrested and jailed earlier this year, turning 19 in juvenile detention before being moved to the "big house".</p>

      <p>He is believed to have been released with an electronic monitoring bracelet and ordered to live at the Central Australian Aboriginal Alcohol Program Unit in Alice Springs.</p>
      <p>It was from this facility he cut his bracelet and caught a ride to Yuendumu about a week before his death.</p>
      <p><i>The Sunday Age</i> and <i>The </i><i>Sun-Herald</i> visited the Robertsons and their extended family in Yuendumu on Saturday at the women's "sorry camp", a space for grieving.</p>
      <p>"We want to be able to see justice served the right way," she says.</p>
      <p>"My granddaughter can't speak for herself, so I am her voice. Me and my husband and the community, we are being strong."</p>

      <p>The family and community elders are pleased at the charges against Constable Rolfe, but are upset he has been granted bail.</p>
      <p>"Aboriginal people who do nothing get locked up. When a white man from a rich family does this he gets bail," she said.</p>
