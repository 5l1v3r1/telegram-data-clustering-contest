      <p>The Nigeria Employers’ Consultative Association has raised concerns over the Central Bank of Nigeria’s directive to banks on lending, saying it could pose a risk to financial stability.</p>
      <p>NECA’s Director-General, Timothy Olawale, who raised the concerns in a statement on Saturday in Lagos said that effective monitoring mechanism should be put in place to avert the negative effects.</p>
      <p>News Agency of Nigeria reports that NECA is the umbrella organisation of employers in the organised private sector of Nigeria.</p>
      <p>Olawale recalled that CBN had on July 4, directed commercial banks in Nigeria to maintain a minimum Loan Deposit Ratio of 60 per cent.</p>
      <p>According to him, this is aimed at promoting growth of the real sector of the economy.</p>
      <p>“The objective of the Apex Bank is clear as regard improving the flow of needed credit to the private sector to stimulate growth.</p>
      <p>“We are concerned that these methods being deployed to achieve this aim may have many unintended negative effects if effective monitoring mechanism is not put in place.</p>
      <p>“The attempt by the CBN is worthy of commendation considering our peculiar situation as a nation and the fact that over N1.5 trillion additional money will be available as credits to the real sector of the economy.</p>
      <p>“However, forcing the banks to lend under the current macro-economic situation will only result in a likely build-up of non-performing loans in the medium to long term, given the sluggish growth of the economy.</p>
      <p>“Also, the high risk in the operating environment, this could pose a risk to financial stability.”</p>
      <p>The director-general also identified high interest rates, which remained at a double digits as a challenge to businesses.</p>
      <p>He said: “With the volatility of the Nigerian economy and the unpredictable regulatory environment, the risk of a double digit interest rate could be too high for businesses.</p>
      <p>“This is especially for the Small and Medium Enterprises that are supposed to also be beneficiaries of the directive.”</p>
      <p>He urged CBN to ensure the effective implementation and monitoring of the directive.</p>
      <p>According to him, more deliberate efforts should be made to ensure a hospitable business environment that will make lending attractive and borrowing by the real sector even more attractive. </p>
