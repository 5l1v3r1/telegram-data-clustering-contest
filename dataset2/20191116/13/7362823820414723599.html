      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/coast-guard-offloads-cocaine-marijuana-southeast-florida">U.S. Coast Guard</a> cutter has seized an apparent narco-submarine carrying more than 5,000 pounds of cocaine worth approximately $69 million during an interdiction operation in the Pacific Ocean.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/video-shows-dramatic-jump-by-guardsmen-onto-vessel-laden-with-cocaine-officials">semi-submersible vessel</a> was transporting 2 1/2 tons of cocaine at the time of the Oct. 23 seizure by Coast Guard law enforcement personnel aboard the Harriet Lane.</p>

      </p>
      <p>“Boarding teams from the cutter deployed in interceptor boats and stopped the suspected smuggling vessel just before midnight,” the Coast Guard said in a <a href="https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDHSCG/bulletins/26bfd75">news release</a> Thursday.</p>
      <p>“The boarding teams took control of the vessel before the four suspected smugglers aboard could sink the craft using installed scuttling valves.”</p>
      <p>The exact location of the bust wasn’t disclosed.</p>
      <p>“I am really proud of our crew and the precision and professionalism with which they conducted this interdiction,” said Cmdr. Dorothy Hernaez, Commanding Officer of the Harriet Lane, in the statement. . “It was an all hands on deck effort to properly position the cutter and to safely make the seizure."</p>
