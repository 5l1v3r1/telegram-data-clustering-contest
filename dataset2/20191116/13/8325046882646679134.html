      <p>All fast-food fans are likely familiar with Wendy’s iconic logo, which features a redheaded girl wearing pigtails. But it’s possible that not everyone knows the real story behind the name – and the pressures that came along with it.</p>
      <p>Wendy’s was founded by Dave Thomas Columbus, Ohio, in <a href="https://www.squaredealblog.com/homewendys/wendys-50th-anniversary-birthday-cake-frosty">1969</a>. When it came to deciding what to call the chain, he tried out the names of all five of his children before he settled on the nickname for his daughter, Melinda, which was Wendy.</p>
      <p>“He said, ‘Wendy, pull your hair up in pigtails.’ So, I did. He got his camera and took pictures of me and my sister and said, ‘Yep, it’s going to be Wendy’s Old-Fashioned Hamburgers,'” Wendy Thomas wrote in a company <a href="https://www.squaredealblog.com/homewendys/the-real-wendy-in-her-own-words">blog post</a> on Friday.</p>
      <p>Today, there are more than <a href="https://www.squaredealblog.com/homewendys/wendys-50th-anniversary-birthday-cake-frosty">6,700</a> Wendy’s locations across the world. And, Wendy is still the face of the brand, for better or worse.</p>
      <p>Before he died in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2003-10-27/wendy-thomas-daddys-girl-gets-back-to-burgers">2002</a>, Dave apologized to his daughter for naming the restaurant after her.</p>
      <p>“He explained, ‘I should’ve just named it after myself, because it put a lot of pressure on you,'” Wendy wrote in the blog post.</p>

      <p>Even with the pressure of being the face of the chain, Wendy said she still feels motivated to carry on her father’s legacy.</p>
      <p>Plus, she admitted, the name is not without its perks.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes if I need a reservation, it helps!” she wrote.</p>
