      <h1>'Unclear' - Three Derby County players who would benefit from a January transfer</h1>
      <h2>Latest Derby County transfer news | Could any of these players benefit from a loan stint away from Pride Park?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T13:05:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 13:05</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Wakefield</a></address>
      <p>There are a number of players in the <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">Derby County</a> squad that have <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/derby-county-transfer-news-shinnie-3541480">not been seeing that much first-team action</a>.</p>
      <p>Rams boss Phillip Cocu is in his first season at Pride Park, and has been spending the first few months in the job figuring out what his best starting line-up is.</p>
      <p>Some players have been featured regularly, while others have had to settle for a place on the bench, or perhaps not even a part of the matchday squad at all.</p>
      <p>Others have also been working their way back from respective injuries, and are yet to get fully match fit.</p>
      <p>We take a look at which Rams players could do with a spell on loan in the <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/derby-county-transfer-news-toney-3541044">January transfer window</a> for one reason or another.</p>
      <h3>Jonathan Mitchell</h3>

      <p>Jonathan Mitchell is currently third-choice goalkeeper at Pride Park, and has really struggled for first-team action this season.</p>
      <p>Kelle Roos has been preferred as Cocu’s main stopper, while on-loan keeper Ben Hamer has been utilised in the two Carabao Cup fixtures.</p>
      <p>Mitchell was on the substitute’s bench for the opening-day win over Huddersfield Town, but has not been part of the matchday squad since the arrival of Hamer.</p>
      <p>Last season, Mitchell had loan spells at Oxford United and Shrewsbury Town, and it may been in the 24-year-old’s best interest to have another temporary stint away from Pride Park.</p>

      <h3>Max Bird</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Max Bird broke onto the scene in September 2017 as a 16-year-old, when he featured in a Carabao Cup defeat to Barnsley at Oakwell.</p>
      <p>His league debut would come over a year later when former manager Frank Lampard introduced the midfielder in place of Mason mount for the closing moments of a 2-1 win over Swansea City last December.</p>
      <p>Since Cocu’s arrival, Bird has made two first-team appearances which have both come in the Carabao Cup against Scunthorpe and Nottingham Forest, respectively.</p>
      <p>He was also an unused substitute in the 2-0 defeat to Hull City last month in the Sky Bet Championship – the only time he has featured in the matchday squad for a league game this season.</p>
      <p>At 19 years old, there is still plenty for Bird to learn as a player, but a brief stint on loan to play regular first-team football may help his development in the long run.</p>
      <h3>Craig Forsyth</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Another player who has been plagued with injuries in recent months is Craig Forsyth.</p>
      <p>The left-back suffered anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) damage to his left knee in the home defeat by Aston Villa in November. His two other ACL injuries during his time at <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county"><u>Derby</u></a><u> </u>were to his right knee.</p>
      <p>Since then, the 30-year-old has been building up his fitness and has recently been featuring regularly for the Under-23s, most recently on Wednesday night in the 7-1 win over Leeds United in the Premier League Cup.</p>
      <p>Derby currently have Max Lowe and Scott Malone as first-team left-backs, while youngster Lee Buchanan can also perform in that role.</p>
      <p>It is unclear what the future holds for Forsyth, and maybe a loan spell away from Derby in order to get first-team minutes may be the best option to him.</p>
