      <h1>Roger Stone supporters push petition for presidential pardon</h1>

      <p>Someone is already pushing to get a presidential pardon for <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/roger-stone-found-guilty-of-lying-to-investigators-in-russia-probe/">Roger Stone</a>.</p>
      <p>“We, the undersigned, respectfully request that the President of the United States grant a full and unconditional pardon to Roger Jason Stone Jr,” reads an official <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/pardon-roger-stone-0">White House petition</a> — which has now generated nearly 5,000 signatures.</p>
      <p>It’s unclear who started the petition, with the creator only identified as “J.V.”</p>
      <p>If the petition gets 100,000 signatures within 30 days, the White House will be forced to respond, according to the government’s official petition website.</p>
      <p>The effort comes less than 24 hours after the former Trump adviser was convicted on seven counts of lying to Congress, witness tampering and obstruction.</p>
      <p>President Trump has made freer use of his pardon powers than his recent predecessors and took to Twitter Friday to go to bat for Stone after he was convicted.</p>
      <p>“So they now convict Roger Stone of lying and want to jail him for many years to come. Well, what about Crooked Hillary, Comey, Strzok, Page, McCabe, Brennan, Clapper, Shifty Schiff, Ohr &amp; Nellie, Steele &amp; all of the others, including even Mueller himself? Didn’t they lie?” <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1195389483664990208">he wrote</a>. “A double standard like never seen before in the history of our Country?”</p>
