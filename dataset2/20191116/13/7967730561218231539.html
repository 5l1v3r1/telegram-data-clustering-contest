      <h1>'There is a sense of party and fun': how Tamarama became Sydney's own little Brazil</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T13:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Sarah Keoghan</a></address>
      <p>If you head down to Tamarama Beach this summer, you could be forgiven for thinking you were at Rio's iconic Copacabana instead.</p>
      <p>Tamarama Surf Life Saving Club has noted a rise in the amount of South Americans at the beach this season, with musical instruments, dancing, volleyball and large Brazilian barbecues now a frequent sight at the popular beach.</p>
      <p>Club president Tim Murray said Tamarama has been "a gathering place" for Brazilian since 2013 but he has seen an increase this year. He puts the attraction down to the shape of the beach, which allows for multiple ball sports to be played at one time.</p>
      <p>"It’s a really nice and fun element at Tamarama, the Brazilians have been a big part of volleyball, and there are some pretty amazing teams," he said. "You really know it’s summer when the Brazilians turn up at Tamarama; it brings a nice flavour to the whole beach."</p>
      <p>The Brazilian population across Australia is rising rapidly, with a threefold increase in the last 10 years. In 2013, the Australian Bureau of Statistics recorded 20,330 Australian residents who were born in Brazil. By 2018, the number had risen to 46,450.</p>

      <p>"The increase in recent years to Australia's population of those who were born in Brazil is mainly being driven by international students," a spokesman for the ABS said. "Many are arriving to do an English Language Intensive Course in the first instance. Most are going to study in NSW and Queensland."</p>
      <p>This season, multiple Brazilians have signed up for Tamarama SLSC's bronze medallion training in hopes of becoming lifesavers. Their captain, Holly Love, said she has "absolutely" seen an increase in the amount of Brazilians using facilities at Tamarama.</p>
      <p>"I think the volleyball is a part of that, the nature of the beach and the inclusive atmosphere we try to have with our club," she said. "We are one of the only clubs in Sydney that takes people regardless of their immigration status.</p>
      <p>"It's fantastic, we love it ... it's like being in a different part of the world.</p>
      <p>"Brazilians are fantastic people, they're always welcoming and share their food, and are always looking for chat. We love having those vibes," she said.</p>
      <p>Ramon Guimaraes, 33, who has lived in Australia for four years, said he signed up to complete his bronze medallion at Tamarama this year after growing up near the beach in Brazil.</p>
      <p>"It's pretty similar to where I was in Brazil," he said. "The beach was my second home. It was my dream to become a lifesaver."</p>

      <p>Lucas Molon, 32, who has also lived in Sydney for four years, said Tamarama is the best beach for surfing. He was inspired to become a lifesaver with the club after he saved two young girls from drowning while body surfing.</p>
      <p>"Bondi is too busy; at Tamarama, there are not as many people, not as many kids running around," he said.</p>
      <p>Ellie Pietsch, who is the caretaker at Tamarama SLSC, said musical instruments and drums are often brought to the beach.</p>
      <p>"There are always South Americans celebrating, using the barbecues and the beach huts," she said. "It's a real community spirit, there is a sense of party and fun, and sharing. It's really lovely."</p>
      <p>But it is just not the eastern suburbs that seem to be a hot spot for South American culture, she said.</p>
      <p>"We’ve got a close Brazilian friend, who calls Dee Why, Dee Why de Janeiro," she said.</p>
      <p>Andre Cerutti runs the Capoeira Brazil School in Tamarama and takes classes down at Tamarama Park. A pioneer in developing the Afro-Brazilian martial art in Australia, Mr Cerutti has watched the increase of the sport on Tama's shoreline since 1992.</p>
      <p>"It’s a very cosy kind of vibe, I feel at home in Tamarama," he said. "We have the park, we have the surfing, it’s a very nice environment, long beaches with nothing."</p>
      <p>He said the pairing of the barbecues and the beach volleyball make it an immediate attraction for South Americans. "That’s the combination to have a party on the beach together."</p>
