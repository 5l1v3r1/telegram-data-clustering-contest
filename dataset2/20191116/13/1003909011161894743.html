      <h3>Transit changes will effect seniors and students</h3>
      <p>Effective Dec. 23, Calgary Transit will revise certain southwest bus routes to improve connectivity between routes and increase usage. After more than 50 years of excellent service, Route 13 “Mount Royal” will lose all five of its current bus stops only to be replaced with a single inbound bus stop on Council Way to the north of the area. Such changes will be in direct conflict with Transit principles. There are no planned replacement outbound stops.</p>
      <p>The changes will ensure citizens of Upper Elbow Park will drive their cars instead of using the current excellent bus system. Many Upper Elbow Park bus riders are seniors and students. As consultation was virtually non-existent, it is very unlikely that residents are even aware that they will be losing their bus service.</p>

      <h3>“Constitutionality” paraphrase draws ire of minister</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Re: Conscience bill no threat to service, minister says, Nov. 14</b>
      </p>
      <p>In an impromptu interview regarding a private member’s bill before the Alberta Legislature, I was asked about a specific court ruling from the Ontario Court of Appeal. While I am a lawyer by trade, I obviously do not follow in detail every court decision in other provinces that do not directly affect Alberta. I answered the reporter honestly: “You’re over my head a little bit.” It’s unfortunate that the Herald misrepresented my answer by not framing the specific question.</p>
      <p>The debate on Bill 207 is important. As MLAs, we should take time to carefully consider the bill and decide if it correctly balances the needs of health-care providers and patients. I want to emphasize, as I did in the interview, that I will always seek to ensure that health-care services are accessible and free from discrimination. I will be taking time to consult with officials, my constituents, and health-care providers before deciding my vote.</p>

      <h3>Bookseller latest victim of rising taxes</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Re: Worries building again over punishing business tax, Opinion, Nov. 14</b>
      </p>
      <p>Thanks to Don Braid for keeping Mike and Susan Hare’s plight in the forefront. I, too, have been a longtime patron of the Owl’s Nest Bookstore, as well as many other now defunct independent booksellers. Sandpiper, we were sad to see you go.</p>
      <p>When will the City of Calgary start walking the walk and actually take care of small business instead of just parroting a wholly unbelievable placating line of rubbish?</p>

      <h3>No mandate for social changes</h3>
      <p>Did Albertans elect Jason Kenney to radically start changing our pensions, our medical rights, our education system or did they elect him to try different things to alleviate financial struggles?</p>
      <p>He appears to be allowing all of our lifestyle/values to be up for grabs, allowing new members bills, etc., and then he is not in the house to vote on these things.</p>
      <p>These are very serious changes that religious groups and very right-wing ideologues are getting to enact through panels and new laws.</p>
      <p>Is this what was wanted? We are losing our progressive opportunities and it will also hurt us economically to be so narrow-minded.</p>
