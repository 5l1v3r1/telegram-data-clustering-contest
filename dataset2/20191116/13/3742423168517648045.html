      <h1>Check Your Android Right Now To See If Your Automatic Google Backup Is Broken</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T13:30:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 13:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lifehacker.com.au/author/brendan-hesse" target="_blank">Brendan Hesse</a></address>
      <p>Google Drive’s automatic device backup feature is apparently busted for a number of Android users. So far, the bug has been reported on Google Pixel, Samsung Galaxy/Note, Motorola, OnePlus, and Huawei devices, and across both Android 9 and Android 10. That’s a large cross-section of Android devices, but the issue could be even more widespread.</p>
      <p>Both <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/11/13/android-backups-to-google-drive-have-been-disabled-on-many-phones-for-months-no-proper-fix-in-sight/">Android Police</a> and <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/14/android-failed-backups-google-drive-issue/">9to5Google</a> note that Android devices won’t notify you if the Google Drive backup fails or stalls this way, so tons of other Android users may be experiencing the bug without even realising it. The only way to confirm your Google Drive backup isn’t working is to check your system settings. Go to <b>Settings &gt; System &gt; Backup</b>, and if the <b>“Backup”</b> button is dimmed out and the various data categories say “Waiting for backup,” then—lucky you—you have the bug.</p>
      <p>Google hasn’t commented on the bug at the time of writing, and no one is sure what’s causing the failed backups in the first place, but users have shared some potential fixes online. The easiest fix requires you to simply change or override your lock screen settings, though there are a few technical changes you can try, too. For now, let’s go over the lock screen method; if that doesn’t work, <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/mi-8/how-to/guide-google-backup-waiting-to-backup-t3895101">try the fixes detailed in this link</a> instead.</p>
      <h3>Temporarily disable the lock screen to resume Google Drive backups</h3>
      <p>This fix is possible on all Android devices, but the specific settings and menus will likely differ between devices.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Open your device settings.</li>
        <li>Use the search bar to find your “lock screen” settings.</li>
        <li>Disable your lock screen and/or unlock method (you’ll need to confirm your current password/PIN/biometrics in order to disable these).</li>
        <li>Save your settings, then back out to the main settings menu and go to <b>Settings &gt; System &gt; Backup</b> to see if the backup feature is working again. If the backups still seem to be broken, reboot your device then try again.</li>
        <li>Make sure you turn your lock screen settings back on after your backup completes successfully.</li>
      </ol>
