      <h3>Days after the SC dismissed the Rafale review petition and contempt proceedings against Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, the BJP is holding a nationwide protest</h3>
      <p>Written By<a href="https://www.republicworld.com/author/navashree-nandini"> Navashree Nandini </a>| Mumbai | Updated On: November 16, 2019 13:02 IST</p>
      <p>Days after the Supreme Court dismissed the Rafale review petition and contempt proceedings against Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, the BJP on Saturday is holding a nationwide protest. The protest seeks Rahul Gandhi's apology over his "lies" on the Rafale issue after the Supreme Court gave a clean chit to the Modi government in the matter on Thursday. Sources from the three cities - New Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata said that BJP workers have gathered outside Congress office and are burning effigies of Rahul Gandhi and chanting slogans against him. </p>
      <p>Earlier on Friday, BJP General Secretary Bhupender Yadav told reporters in New Delhi that the Congress and Rahul Gandhi were "exposed" by the Supreme Court's verdict and they should now tender an apology. He also mocked the Congress's demand for a probe in the issue, noting that the court, in a unanimous verdict, rejected the petitions seeking a probe in the purchase of Rafale fighter aircraft and also quashed the pleas for a review of its order.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, BJP working president JP Nadda on Friday asked party functionaries to expose the "blatant lie" of Congress leaders over the Rafale deal that has hurt the country's image abroad. At a meeting with party leaders in Dehradun, he asked them to go to people and "expose" the Congress's "slander campaign" against the government.</p>

      <h3>What is the Supreme Court's verdict?</h3>
      <p>The Supreme Court on Thursday dismissed the contempt proceeding against Rahul Gandhi which was filed by BJP leader Meenakshi Lekhi. In the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the Congress leader attributed his ‘Chowkidar chor hai’ jibe against Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the Apex Court. Following this, Lekhi filed a contempt plea against the leader. After the SC issued a contempt notice against Gandhi, the latter tendered an apology seeking closure of the proceedings. The top court has now accepted his apology and said that it is unfortunate that the contemnor made these statements. </p>
      <p>Pronouncing the judgement, Justice Kaul said the contemnor should have been more careful. The top court observed that a person holding such an important position should be more careful. The Court also said that no Court should be dragged in any political discourse.</p>
