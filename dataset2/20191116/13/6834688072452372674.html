      <p>Pakistan’s leading energy company, Byco Petroleum Pakistan Ltd, has <a href="https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/568885-bank-alfalah-byco-to-collaborate">teamed up</a> with Bank Alfalah, one of the nation’s largest financial institutions, in order to introduce digital payments across Byco’s nationwide network of retail locations.</p>
      <p>Bank Alfalah has supported the OneQR concept. The bank will now be assisting Byco Petroleum in accepting online payments via its Alfa App. Byco will also be able to accept digital payments via 25 other online banking apps being used in Pakistan.</p>
      <p>Every Bank Alfalah client that uses the Alfa app will be able to drive to their nearest Byco retail center and get a liter of petrol for only Rs.100 (appr. $0.64). The app’s users can purchase up to 10 liters of petrol each day and 300 liters per month, at this reduced price.</p>
      <p>Bank Alfalah Limited is a private bank that’s owned by the Abu Dhabi Group. It’s the 7th largest bank in Pakistan, with 662 local branches, 10 overseas branches with 7 based in Bangladesh and one each in Afghanistan, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
      <p>Established in 1997, Bank Alfalah was a public limited firm under the Companies Ordinance 1984. The institution’s banking operations began in November 1, 1997.</p>
