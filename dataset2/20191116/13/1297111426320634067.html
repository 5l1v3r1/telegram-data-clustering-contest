      <h3>Thank you, Doug Alexander</h3>
      <p>Growing up in small-town Saskatchewan in the ’60s, one of my prized possessions was my hand-sized Sanyo transistor radio, obtained from profits from my Regina Leader-Post delivery route. Every day I could tune it in to CKCK Radio, where “Canada’s Oldest Teenager”, Doug Alexander, was playing all the latest tunes.</p>
      <p>My parents called it rock and roll, but how could you say Bobby Vinton or Engelbert Humperdinck were rock and roll? Doug introduced me to the best music in the world, and I will be forever grateful.</p>
      <p>Those same songs are still played to this day and have become timeless. We enjoyed the British Invasion together, the Canadian Invasion with the likes of Anne Murray, Gord Lightfoot and Bobby Curtola. Doug’s nightly show, The Battle of the Sounds, was my favourite when a challenger he would introduce would try and knock off the champion. I remember “Paul and Paula” were champs for a long time.</p>
      <p>After his retirement Doug joined Cable Regina (now Access Communications). He was still the voice to listen to, whether it was calling Access to find out why the TV wasn’t working or the dozens of times he would be the host of something.</p>
      <p>(Alexander passed away Nov. 10 at the Pasqua Hospital in Regina, just short of 84 years of age, from lung cancer.)</p>
      <p>Doug, your voice will live on in the memories of the thousands of listeners and generations of people who grew up listening to all that great music you brought us. We can never thank you enough.</p>

      <h3>Sask. Party sold us a white elephant</h3>
      <p>I just drove the new bypass and I have some questions about the traffic estimates used to justify this huge pile of our tax money.</p>
      <p>I have driven it five times during the last week, and it sure does not seem to be very busy. My highest mid-afternoon count was only 11 vehicles oncoming, of which three were semi trucks.</p>
      <p>As this bypass was built to work in conjunction with the failing Global Transportation Hub, one has to ask just who was at the centre of all the estimates about the projected use of all of this. We should all be very curious to see if the traffic numbers for the bypass and all its overpasses are anywhere near the projected numbers used to justify their construction. If they are not reasonably close, there should be an inquiry into the waste of our tax dollars by the Saskatchewan Party and its ministers.</p>
      <p>It seems to me that truckers driving from Calgary would probably stay in Regina overnight rather than drive by the city due to driving time limit laws, so where is the bulk of the bypass traffic supposed to come from, other than the hugely underperforming GTH?</p>
      <p>I feel we have been sold a white elephant by the Sask. Party, who lately seem to have absolutely no grounding in reality.</p>
