      <h1>Factorio 1.0 release date has been set for 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T13:01:47+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 13:01</time> by <a rel="author">Aran Suddi</a></address>
      <p>Wube Software has confirmed the date on which it expects to release the 1.0 version of Factorio, the construction and management sim, which has been in early access since 2016. The date isn’t any time soon but the team has decided on September 25th, 2020 as being the day the 1.0 version of the game goes live, with all the main features completely done. Factorio 1.0 won’t be the end of development but after that it’ll be more about adding bonus content.</p>
      <p>In a blog post the team wrote:</p>
      <blockquote>we feel that the Factorio development is taking way too long. The approach “It is done when it is done” was serving us well to deliver a high quality product, but if we continued this way, we would be doing it basically forever. A lot of us don’t have any problem working on Factorio for some more time, but the main problem is, that we would like to introduce new features and content instead of just polishing parts that are already present in the game. We also considered, that the game is quite polished now, and if we just pushed the button to release 1.0, it wouldn’t be a catastrophe. From our perspective, a lot of things wouldn’t be finished, but from the perspective of a new player, the things we are working on now are mainly nitpicks.<br/><br/>With this in mind, we decided to just specify a 1.0 release date publicly, so we have to stick with it. We will just focus on the most important aspects as we approach the date, and we just do whatever we have time to do. Once the 1.0 happens, we can have some rest and after that, we can finally focus on the content and features again.<br/><br/>The date is 25th September 2020.<br/><br/>Version 1.0 does not mean that development on the game will end, or that Factorio is 100% finished. When we have a better idea of what we will be working on after the 1.0 release, we will let you know.</blockquote>
