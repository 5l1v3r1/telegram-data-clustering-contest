      <p>Week 11 is chalk full with intriguing matchups, from a high-profile showdown between the Texans and Ravens and a rematch between NFC West rivals Cardinals and 49ers to an AFC South tilt between the Jaguars and Colts on the early Sunday slate. As well, Patriots and Eagles collide in an intra-conference showdown and Bears and Rams cap Sunday Night Football and, finally, the Chiefs take on the Chargers in a divisional tilt in Mexico to pull the curtain down on week 11 in Monday Night football. Kicking everything off though is the AFC North battle between the plucky Pittsburgh Steelers and the hyped-up Cleveland Browns on Thursday Night Football.</p>

      <p>Pittsburgh Steelers kick off week 11 when they descend on the Cleveland Browns for an AFC North showdown in Thursday Night Football’s primetime slot. Both teams are coming off winning performances in week 10 but something’s gotta give.</p>
      <p>Mike Tomlin’s lads pulled off a fourth straight win against the odds at the expense of the fancied Los Angeles Rams, the defending NFC champions no less, at Heinz Field on Sunday. On the heels of the victory, Pittsburgh moved into the sixth seed spot in the AFC playoff frame.</p>
      <p>Cleveland Browns snapped a four-game negative skid and a winless run at home in 2019 with a pivotal win over the Buffalo Bills at FirstEnergy Stadium. It did come down to a missed field goal by Bills’ kicker Stephen Hauschka in the dying seconds, one of two missed field goals that played a part in the bottom line. However, Baker Mayfield and Co. aren’t complaining. They’ll take anything they can get now, given they’re only 3-6 SU on the season and their campaign hangs on a sliver of hope.</p>
      <p>Cleveland’s vaunted offense hasn’t covered itself in glory in the first half of the season. If they’re to put paid on the negative criticism, they’ll need to win out down the stretch. This will be a daunting prospect against a Steelers defense that is up for the challenge and putting butter-fingers Baker Mayfield through his paces.</p>
      <p>Oddsmakers opened this game on a 3-point spread with the Browns to the good at home and the game total set to 41. As it stands, the public has bet up the Steelers forcing the spread to shrink by a half-point at early doors with several sportsbooks. Clearly, bettors are buying what the Steelers are selling. For those bettors looking to back the Steelers, grabbing the points while they’re still tipped at +3 now is a worthwhile NFL pick.</p>
      <p>Where the total is concerned it has dipped to 40-points with the UNDER emerging the popular early bet. UNDER 40 is still a workable option seeing as the Browns offense has been held to 16.4 points per game on average over the last 5 games. However, bettors may want to hold on the total until kick off before pulling the trigger.</p>
      <p>
        <b>NFL Betting Trends: </b>
      </p>
      <p>— The total has gone UNDER in 8 of Pittsburgh's last 9 games on the road<br/>—Steelers are 7-0-1 SU in their last 8 games when playing Browns<br/>—The total has gone UNDER in 5 of Cleveland's last 6 games when playing at home againstPittsburgh<br/>—The total has gone OVER in 4 of Cleveland's last 5 games when playing Pittsburgh</p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Detroit are the epitome of the walking wounded. Matthew Stafford, who has been playing at an MVP clip, was a surprise late addition to the injured crew when he was held back on game day last Sunday with fractured bones in his back. It was the first time since 2010 Stafford was side-lined in a game.</p>
      <p>His absence was sorely felt and nowhere more so than on the scoreboard as the Lions succumbed to a 20-13 loss to Chicago, marking their second loss in a row and fifth on the season. As it is, the Lions prop up the NFC North and things are looking grim.<br/>Speaking of losers, the Cowboys were upset by the Minnesota Vikings 28-24 in Sunday Night Football. It marked the fourth loss of the season and third loss to a credible opponent, begging the question whether Dallas is a legitimate NFC threat after all.</p>
      <p>As it is, most sportsbooks are holding the NFL line off the board because there is speculation about Stafford’s status for this crucial Sunday game. The Lions certainly need their starter to play if they’re to have a prayer in this game and, in turn, in their 2019 campaign. Where Dallas is concerned, ‘Will the real Cowboys please stand up?’</p>
      <p>For the time being betting this game isn’t viable with all the uncertainty clouding over it. NFL bettors are best to hold back until later in the week when the status of Stafford is clearer and a proper NFL line is posted.</p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Nick Foles is back! Woohoo! Let the games begin. A well-rested Jaguars side, coming off a week 10 bye, is set to take on an Indianapolis Colts team that just endured the dubious honour of losing to the woeful Miami Dolphins. Granted Jacoby Brissett was noticeably sat on the side lines while Brian Hoyer was under centre, but it was the DOLPHINS! At Lucas Oil Stadium, no less.</p>
      <p>That should have been a straightforward win for the Colts, no ifs or buts about it.? Good teams have found ways to win with backups this season and the fact that the Colts didn’t could prove costly down the stretch. It might even take the shine off of their <a href="https://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/nfl-football/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=sportingnews.com&amp;utm_campaign=sporting%20news&amp;utm_content=article&amp;utm_term=nfl%20odds">NFL odds</a> for week 11.</p>
      <p>In any event, looking forward the Colts welcome the Jaguars at Lucas Oil in week 11 for what<br/>should be a very intriguing AFC South showdown between two teams that technically have a legitimate stake in the running. As it stands, Brissett is likely to start on Sunday. However, NFL bettors can’t take that for granted. Much of the same was implied in week 10 only for Frank<br/>Reich to hold back his starter in favor of Hoyer.</p>
      <p>Vegas lookahead lines installed the Colts as the field-goal faves at home and the total was tipped at a modest 44 points. However, most sportsbooks are holding this game off the board because Brissett hasn’t been confirmed as the starter yet. Meaning this is yet another game NFL bettors should sit tight on until appropriate <a href="https://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/nfl-football/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=sportingnews.com&amp;utm_campaign=sporting%20news&amp;utm_content=article&amp;utm_term=nfl%20odds">NFL odds</a> are released.</p>

      <p>The AFC East clash between the Buffalo Bills and Miami Dolphins sets up an intriguing bill du jour for NFL bettors to sink their teeth into thanks largely to the hosts’ sudden shot to fame by pulling off the upset in Indianapolis. It was a stunning result that saw the Dolphins stack a couple of wins in as many weeks. Buffalo, meanwhile, stuttered against the Browns, donating Cleveland its first home win of the season.</p>
      <p>Indeed, given the contrasting fortunes of both these teams in week 10 the betting on this game is split down the middle at early doors, forcing the NFL line to shrink from an initial offering of Bills -7 to -5.5 with various sports betting outlets.</p>
      <p>It’s also quite likely this NFL line will experience more movement as bettors weigh in the lead up to kick-off. For those on the fence with this matchup for their NFL picks, bet this game later in the week as the playing field levels on the NFL odds board.</p>

      <p>Kirk Cousins finally wins a primetime game against a team that’s above .500 but he’s not getting quite the kudos for the accomplishment one might expect. Instead, the defense and Mike Zimmer’s strategizing genius get the praise. Oh La.</p>
      <p>The Vikings have momentum and home advantage to underscore the favorable NFL odds for their upcoming date with the Denver Broncos. In fact, it’s one of three games to open in double-digit territory for week 11 NFL picks. Conversely, the total for this game is one of the lowest of the week.</p>
      <p>Brandon Allen is set to get his second straight start in the NFL after leading the Broncos to victory over the Cleveland Browns at Mile High two weeks ago. It was a commendable result for the backup starter but beating the Browns at home is one thing and beating the Vikings on the road is another.</p>
      <p>Whether Allen can build on his winning start remains to be seen. Oddsmakers aren’t holding out much hope evidently, but the public is split down the middle as far as the point spread is concerned at early doors.</p>

      <p>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers finally snapped the negative trend with a win over the Arizona Cardinals that lived up to it’s high-scoring billing. Jameis Winston and Co. edged the Cardinals 30-27 to improve to 3-6 SU, but even in their win there was plenty to be concerned about. Namely, donating Kyler Murray with yet another 300-plus yard outing on the season.</p>
      <p>The New Orleans Saints, meanwhile, were stunned by divisional rivals Atlanta Falcons in a 26-9 loss at the Superdome that sent seismic shockwaves through NFL betting circles. Drew Brees was held without a touchdown and sacked multiple times to the shock of the dismayed New Orleans’ faithful.</p>
      <p>Inasmuch as both teams enjoyed contrasting fortunes in week 10, there doesn’t appear to be a spill over in NFL betting markets. Not only did the Saints open as the significant road faves but also early betting is seeing the line move from Saints -5 to -6 already.</p>
      <p>Teddy Bridgewater and the Saints crushed Tampa 31-24 in week 5. It follows, an annoyed Brees will be looking to bounce back in a big way in Tampa. For those bettors on board with a Saints bounce back performance, grab the points now before the line gets bet up higher.</p>

      <p>Dwayne Haskins has been named as the starter for the foreseeable future in Washington, which could be an indication they’re abandoning their 2019 campaign. Well, let’s face it, the Redskins’ season is all but done. It’s only sensible to discover what they have in their choice draft pick and plan for the future.</p>
      <p>Starting Haskins against the 2-7 SU Jets isn’t a terrible idea either. It’s a winnable game on paper, meaning it’s a reasonable assignment to give a rookie quarterback especially as Washington is coming off a bye week and have the advantage of extra time to prepare for the subpar Jets.</p>
      <p>Now, Sam Darnold and the Jets are coming off only their second win of the season, a 34-27 win over the Giants at MetLife. However, the Jets aren’t fooling anyone and Darnold is still a risky prospect with 10 turnovers this season (9 interceptions and one fumble).</p>
      <p>As it stands, bookmakers opened this game on a PK line, essentially letting the public temper the market. As well, they pegged the game on one of the lowest totals of the week at 38. Interestingly,early betting has moved the needle in favor of…wait for it…the Redskins and , in turn, raised the total by half a point at various top-rated online sportsbooks. Is the public really sweet on Haskins despite all the negative feedback coming out of Washington about his lack of readiness for the pros?</p>
      <p>To be fair, this game is a complete and utter tossup for week 11 NFL picks. That said, with neither team boasting a stout defense a play on the OVER looks to be the most viable option.</p>

      <p>Matt Ryan and the Falcons found a measure of redemption in week 10 when they handed New Orleans Saints a shock upset at the Superdome. Expecting the Falcons to stack back-to-back wins though doesn’t seem to be on the cards. At least not with oddsmakers because the Falcons enter week 11 at the distinct disadvantage. So much so, one would think week 10 never happened.</p>
      <p>Well, the assignment in Carolina is no picnic. Kyle Allen continues to impress; Christian McCaffrey continues to terrorize opposing teams; and the Panthers defense is one of the better defenses in the league. That said, the Panthers are coming off a narrow loss to the Packers at Green Bay, one in which the Packers’ final goal-line-stand denied Kyle Allen and the Panthers a comeback in the dying seconds.</p>
      <p>As it stands, the Panthers are laying -5.5 on the NFL odds board while the total is soaring at 50.5. Given Atlanta’s recent performance it wouldn’t be surprising to see a knee-jerk reaction in their favor to cover as the road underdogs. Thus, for those bettors that are high on Atlanta, exploiting the points now might be a viable option.</p>
      <p>Then again, news on Devonta Freeman’s foot injury, which he sustained in Sunday’s win over the Saints, is bound to impact this line somewhat so there is an argument to be had for playing the wait-and-see game before settling on your week 11 NFL picks.</p>

      <p>This is the marquee clash of the early slate on Sunday, a blockbuster clash between Deshaun Watson and Lamar Jackson, two of the standout young quarterbacks of 2019. Get the popcorn ready because this should be a right cracker.</p>
      <p>Both the Texans and Ravens are flying high in their respective divisions, looking to defend their titles with a second straight in 2019. The Texans are coming off a bye week, so they’ll be well rested and the added week of preparation will be key especially for Houston’s defense as it gets set to take on the dynamic, multi-dimensional threat posed by Lamar Jackson.</p>
      <p>The Ravens backed up their win over the Patriots with a ruthless evisceration of the Cincinnati Bengals in week 10, a game in which Jackson posted a perfect passer-rating for the second time this season and earned him a seat on the bench with his shades on well before time was called.</p>
      <p>Appropriately, the Ravens enter as the significant home chalk. They’re 3-1 SU at home with the lone loss coming to divisional rivals Cleveland Browns (still shocking that they lost that game, isn’t it?). Indeed, with that loss to the Browns hanging over Baltimore, the spread does look exploitable especially when considering the opponent is a credible one.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>The Cardinals and Niners are set to renew hostilities merely a few weeks after their sensational Thursday Night showdown clash delivered plenty of excitement for their respective fanbases. Will the reprisal of this NFC West showdown live up to its predecessor? Or, will the Niners, who are coming off their first loss of the season, suffer a hangover effect after losing a right cracker to the Seattle Seahawks in overtime?</p>
      <p>Arizona punched above its weight class and came within a field-goal in the 28-25 loss in week 9 to San Francisco. Yet, in spite of the narrow loss, oddsmakers went to press with a double-digit spread on their away game of this series. One would think the week 9 result never happened.</p>
      <p>What did have an impact on the NFL odds board was the crazy 27-24 loss in overtime to Seattle, particularly as the Niners had plenty of chances to win the game only to frit those away shamelessly, including a botched field goal in overtime for the sure-win. As a result, the Niners have come down from an initial offering of -14.5 to -11.5 at various sports betting outlets.</p>
      <p>Given the previous meeting between these divisional foes was close as well after Monday’s nerve-wracking loss to the Seahawks exposed some of the offensive weaknesses of the Niners and saw Emmanuel Sanders (rib injury) leave the game, the massive double-digit spread looks extremely exploitable for bettors. Those on the Kyler Murray train might fancy grabbing the points before the needle moves further down.</p>

      <p>Starting Ryan Finley against one of the toughest AFC teams was akin to sending a lamb to slaughter. So, it was in the 49-19 beatdown the Ravens handed the Bengals and the rookie starter in his first NFL appearance at Paul Brown stadium.</p>
      <p>While the Raiders don’t loom as large as the Ravens did in week 10, it’s still a tough ask for the rookie quarterback on the road, especially with the Raiders riding the momentum into week 11 following a Thursday Night Football triumph over the Los Angeles Chargers that had Jon Gruden basking the embrace of fans in the stands.</p>
      <p>Fittingly, oddsmakers have gone to press with a double-digit spread for this game – the third on the week’s NFL odds board. Color the world shocked if the Bengals put up much resistance in this game. They’re winless in 2019 and in very real danger of continuing on that vein of negative form all the way to week 17.</p>

      <p>In spite of the contrasting fortunes for both teams, the Patriots enter this week 11 intra-conference clash as the 3.5-point road favorites with most sports betting venues. An NFL line that has held firm through early doors.</p>
      <p>The Patriots are typically favored by much larger point spreads, so for those bettors that are all in with the Patriots the market on this game must feel like all your Christmases have come early. Grab the points now before the line gets bet up. The Patriots are regularly one of the trendy NFL picks from week to week.</p>
      <p>On a side note, it’s also worth keeping an eye on the status of Rob Gronkowski, who has yet to make his final decision about playing this season or not. As it stands, he’s still technically in retirement but Robert Kraft has made no bones about wanting his prized tight end back.

      <p>The Los Angeles Rams are off to the worst start on a season under Sean McVay, punctuated by the loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers in week 10 – sans Big Ben, no less. It wasn’t a good look for Jared Goff, or Blake Bortles, who made a brief and short-lived appearance in the game.</p>
      <p>In spite of the unmemorable outing in Pittsburgh, the Los Angeles Rams return to the NFL betting floor as the solid favorites for their upcoming date with the Chicago Bears. A surprisingly large fave that hasn’t gone down well with the public it seems, mind you.</p>
      <p>Rams opened as the -7.5 faves, but they’ve come down in favor at most sportsbooks to -6.5. The public isn’t buying what the Rams are selling this season and it’s showing with rather lopsided betting on this game going towards the Chicago Bears.</p>
      <p>The Bears aren’t what many expected them to be this season but they’re coming off a crucial win in week 10 that has resonated with NFL bettors. How much stock should bettors put on a win over a Mathew Stafford-less Detroit Lions is debatable.</p>
      <p>Of all the games on the week’s board, this is a right tossup for week 11 NFL picks because it’s hard to feel confident about either team, especially in primetime NFL betting.

      <p>The Kansas City Chiefs were stunned by the Tennessee Titans in a game that marked the belated return of Patrick Mahomes. It was a stunning performance by Ryan Tannehill and a Titans defense that didn’t quit.</p>
      <p>Next up for the Chiefs is a divisional clash with the Los Angeles Chargers, who are coming off a bitter loss to the Oakland Raiders on the road. It was yet another disappointing result in an ever increasingly disappointing season for Philip Rivers and Co.</p>
      <p>The Chiefs have as many losses in the first 10 weeks of this season as they had for the entire 2018 season. Conversely, the Chargers have as many wins in the first 10 weeks of the season as they had losses for the entire 2018 season.</p>
      <p>This AFC West showdown is slated to get underway in Mexico City and will put a bow on week 11’s round of NFL betting. Not surprisingly, the Chiefs are laying -4 on the NFL odds board. It’s a nominal spread for the Chiefs – not what they’re used to since Mahomes took over as their signal caller – but if there’s a lesson to be had in previous weeks it’s that Mahomes can’t do it alone. The defense needs to step up otherwise things won’t go to plan.</p>
      <p>Having said that for those bettors that are on board with Kansas City in this game, grab the points now before the line moves. It’s quite likely the public will bet this game up in the coming days.</p>
