      <p>Gogglebox's <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/tv/gogglebox-viewers-concerned-as-fan-favourites-giles-and-mary-miss-a-week/">Giles Wood</a> has split opinion among viewers after being accused of making a "sexist" joke about female plumbers.</p>
      <p>Giles was chatting to wife and fellow <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/gogglebox/">Gogglebox</a> star Mary Killen during Friday night's show when he made the controversial gag.</p>
      <p>Sitting at home in Wiltshire, Giles began: "What I think we might do, Nutty, is employ a lady plumber.</p>

      <p>"Do you think they'd be as good as a man plumber? Could we pay them half?</p>
      <p>"I'll ring them up and say, 'Because you're a woman plumber, would you mind accepting a slightly lower rate?'"</p>
      <p>Although she initially said it would be "funny", Mary did go on to defend female plumbers.</p>
      <aside>Do you think they'd be as good as a man plumber? Could we pay them half?</aside>
      <p>She told him: "[The female plumber] would probably say no we charge twice what a man would charge.</p>
      <p>"I bet you anything those women plumbers do everything to make sure they're just as good as the men, if not better."</p>
      <p>But Giles, who suggested lady plumbers were only for "female divorcees" to hire, simply replied: "Do you think they make cups of tea as well?</p>

      </p>
      <p>"Because being women, you wouldn't offer a woman a cup of tea if she could make it herself. You don't want men in the kitchen do you."</p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, Giles' so-called quip caused quite a stir online, with many tweeting their fury at both him and Channel 4.</p>
      <p>One blasted: "@Channel4 get Giles off gogglebox.... Sexist pig!!!!"</p>

      <p>Another raged: "What an [bleep] Giles is from Gogglebox. With those sexist comments about women plumbers.</p>
      <p>"I am disgusted that Channel 4 even let that be aired! Vile! #GoggleboxFriday #channel4 #sexistpig."</p>

      <p>A third wrote: "Giles you sexist pig. A bet a woman plumber is better than a bloke #Gogglebox."</p>
      <p>However, there was plenty of support for the Gogglebox star too.</p>
      <p>Jumping to Giles' defence, one viewer tweeted: "People having a meltdown over Giles' words. Pretty sure they were tongue in cheek #gogglebox."</p>

      <p>Another fan raved: "#gilesandmary on fine form. Giles is such a wind up merchant. #gogglebox."</p>
      <p>Branding the critics "snowflakes", one even said: "The amount of people getting upset at what Giles was saying on Gogglebox. Calm down snowflakes, was obvious he was having a bit of fun."</p>
      <p>Giles and Mary joined Gogglebox in 2015 and are known for their quirky and eccentric views and opinions.</p>
      <p>The pair often refer to each other as 'nutty' when appearing on the Channel 4 show.</p>
