      <p><b>Why do you love 1940s fashion?</b><br/>I have a great connection to the period because I grew up on film noir, reading hard-boiled Raymond Chandler novels and hearing World War II stories from my Oma and Opa. The clothing then was strong: shoulder pads, nipped waists and that classic red lip I love. Also, it was practical enough that you could run to the bomb shelter in your sturdy heels, but also go out for dinner.</p>
      <p><b>What’s the oldest thing in your wardrobe?</b><br/>Most of my clothes are from the 1930s to the ’60s but I do have some antique pieces. The oldest thing is a Victorian mourning shawl: silk, with beading and fur trim. It’s exquisitely beautiful.</p>
      <p><b>What is the most recent fashion item you bought?</b><br/>A victory pin that would have been worn by a patriotic woman during World War II. Victory pieces are one of my obsessions.</p>
      <p><b>How would you dress for ...</b><br/><b>... a first date?</b> Exactly as I always do. So, a 1940s dress, Mary Jane shoes and my walking stick, Wolfie.<br/><b>... a plane?</b> When I flew out to Australia from Vancouver, I wore a black jersey Vivienne Westwood dress, Fluevog boots and had a corset in my bag to put on when I got off the plane. It’s not how everyone dresses, but it’s more comfortable for me than pants.<br/><b>... the Oscars?</b> I’d wear vintage, or an Alex Perry number – he made my wedding dress and knows how to dress my hourglass figure.</p>
      <p><b>Do you have a favourite fashion designer?</b><br/>Lilli Ann – they were very big in the middle of the last century. I’ve only got one of their suits but I am always on the lookout for more.</p>
      <p><b>What are three essential items in your wardrobe?</b><br/>Red lipstick is number one – even though it’s not technically part of my wardrobe, I don’t feel dressed without it. Number two would be a sturdy but feminine heel, and number three would be a classic 1940s day dress.</p>
      <p><b>Can you remember a favourite outfit you had as a child?</b><br/>A devil costume with a cape and little horns that my mother made me for Halloween when I was about six years old.</p>

      <p><b>Do you have a favourite party look?</b><br/>Surprise, surprise, I’d wear a 1940s dress, in red – one of my favourite colours – and costume jewellery.</p>
      <p><b>Your worst fashion mistake?</b><br/>I would say I dressed terribly up until seven years ago, when I started wearing vintage. I didn’t have the courage before then.</p>
      <p><b>What would you buy if money were no object?</b><br/>Vintage hats and early Chanel.</p>
      <p><b>What would you never wear?</b><br/>A sweatsuit.</p>
      <p><b>Who is your style muse?</b><br/>Ava Gardner, when she burst onto the screen in <i>The Killers</i>.</p>
      <p><b>What was your first fashion moment?</b><br/>It was when I got my first big modelling job at the age of 16 and I bought a Versace suit. It was<br/>around 1990, I was living in Milan and there were those wonderful Versace ads of all the supermodels of the day in miniskirt suits with big gold buttons and shoulder<br/>pads. That was the suit I bought and I’ll never part with it.</p>
