      <p>Shared by netizen <a href="https://twitter.com/NikkiZamri/status/1194585880490471424?s=08">@NikkiZamri</a>, the video featured the amazing voice of his roommate singing at the top of his lungs cheering up a fellow roomie who remained laying on his bed, apparently on the verge of tears.</p>
      <p>In his status he writes, <b>“To all the girls out there, know that not all men are trash. I’m saddened to see how broken my friend is but at the same time is happy that another is trying to cheer him up.”</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>“You will find the right partner soon. Time will heal.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>The video which has garnered more than 33k retweets also witnesses the talent of his roommate singing Malay and English songs.</p>
      <p>Here is another video of him singing Celine Deon’s My Heart Will Go On, Siti Nurhaliza and many more.</p>
