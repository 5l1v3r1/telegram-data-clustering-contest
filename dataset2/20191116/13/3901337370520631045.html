      <p>Bale has not featured since the last international break, but is expected to return to action on Saturday when Wales lock horns with Azerbaijan in a European Championship qualifier.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old's call-up has not gone down well in the Spanish capital, including his teammate Toni Kroos, who was left confused that the winger was not able to play for Los Blancos.</p>
      <p>"I definitely have more excitement playing for Wales," Bale said ahead of the Group E qualifier in Azerbaijan on Saturday.</p>

      <p>"I've been with most of the older players since we were in the U17s.</p>
      <p>"It's like playing with your mates down the park on a Sunday. It's normal.</p>
      <p>"With Wales, I'm speaking my own language and feel more comfortable. But it doesn't change what I do on the pitch.</p>
      <p>"I always give 100 per cent on the pitch wherever I am, that's what I always strive to do."</p>
