      <h2>Michelle Wallace featured on the now-cancelled ITV talk show when she was at her lowest point and addicted to heroin for 20 years</h2>

      <p>Former The Jeremy Kyle Show participant Michelle Wallace has stunned fans of the axed show by unveiling her transformation after a year of sobriety.</p>
      <p>The talk show star lived a life of prostitution and was addicted to heroin for 20 years before she turned her life around following an appearance on the now axed ITV show.</p>
      <p>Next month will mark 12-months since Michelle quit her drug habit and she took to social media to show fans how far she had come by sharing before-and-after photos of herself.</p>
      <p>Taking to popular video sharing app Tik Tok, Michelle unveiled her new, healthier appearance.</p>

      <p>"Today a year ago I'm came [sic] to Luton off the jk show to rehab I'm gonna be a year clean on the 1/12/09,” she wrote as she shared her striking images.</p>
      <p>Fans of The Jeremy Kyle Show would be forgiven for not recognising the formerly gaunt, grey-skinned woman as she shared her new look.</p>
      <p>Gone are the greasy, dark locks of hair and instead Michelle has a fresh, thicker head of hair, while her face looks noticeably refreshed, fuller, and healthier.</p>

      <p>Michelle featured on The Jeremy Kyle show after her sister banned her from her grandmother’s funeral amid accusations she was a thief.</p>
      <p>Michelle then vowed to kick her heroin habit - shocking fans when she appeared on the show again in April after beginning rehab.</p>
      <p>One fan of the show wrote on <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> : "Oh my god, she looks amazing! #JeremyKyle,” while another said: " She looks 20 years younger. #jeremykyle".</p>
      <p>The Jeremy Kyle Show was pulled off the air and axed for good earlier this year after another participant killed themselves after filming scenes which never aired.</p>
