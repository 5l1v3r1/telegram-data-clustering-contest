      <h1>Mid Worcestershire Election candidates for 2019 - Labour, Tories, Lib Dem, Brexit party and more</h1>
      <h2>The constituency includes the towns of Droitwich Spa and Evesham and the many semi-rural villages around the cathedral city of Worcester</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T13:02:53+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 13:02</time> by <a rel="author">James Rodger, https://www.facebook.com/jamesrodgerjournalist</a></address>
      <p>Nigel Huddleston was just getting his feet under the table as an MP when the <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/general-election">2017 General Election</a> came along and shook it up.</p>
      <p>The Conservative MP succeeded Peter Luff as the Mid Worcestershire representative in 2017 - before holding his seat later that year when Theresa May  called another General Election.</p>
      <p>The constituency includes the towns of Droitwich Spa and Evesham and the many semi-rural villages around the cathedral city of Worcester.</p>
      <p>Mr Huddleston will face competition from four other candidates in 2019.</p>
      <p>Last time, he polled no less than 57 per cent of the votes - so it would be something of a shock were it not to be a Conservative hold.</p>
      <p>These are the candidates for Mid Worcestershire in 2019:</p>

      <p>Margaret Rowley (LD)</p>
      <p>Sue Howarth (Green)</p>
      <p>Barmy Lord Brockman (Loony)</p>
      <p>Traditionally, elections are held every five years to determine which party will head up the British government. However since 2015, this year will be the third time that voters have been called to the ballot box.</p>
      <p>Following the controversial Brexit referendum in 2016, the public has witnessed tiresome debates in Parliament resulting in several failed exit deal suggestions.</p>
      <p>Three-and-a-half years on, we’re still quite a way off deciding what the state of play will be when the UK leaves the European Union. </p>
      <p>At present, Prime Minister, Boris Johnson does not have enough Conservative MPs to pass new laws and approve plans for a Brexit strategy. </p>
      <p>It is hoped the general election on December 12, will amend that.</p>
