      <h2>Anthony Joshua has drafted in some new names to prepare for Andy Ruiz Jr as he looks to avenge his shock defeat in the rematch in Saudi Arabia next month</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T13:17:06+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 13:17</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Anthony Joshua has been leaving no stone unturned is his preparations to face Andy Ruiz Jr in a rematch next month.</p>
      <p>The British heavyweight star will look to recapture his world title belts in Saudi Arabia after being stunned in New York in June.</p>
      <p>Joshua was undone by Ruiz, 6ft, at Madison Square Garden with his dislike for fighting those shorter than him on full display.</p>
      <p>He has been forced to go back to the drawing board with coach Rob McCracken - and it has led to a major change in training camp approach.</p>
      <p>With a full camp to prepare for Ruiz and his style - rather than being expected to face Jarrell Miller, 6ft4, until a few weeks before his June 1 fight - Joshua has rung the changes.</p>
      <p>Previous favourite sparring partners such as Lawrence Okolie and Martin Bakole have not been called up, instead turning to some unknown prospects and one particularly big name to put him through his paces.</p>
      <p>Here's a run-down of the five men we know have been in Joshua's camp ahead of his huge night.</p>

      <h3>Dereck Chisora</h3>
      <p>Dereck Chisora needs no introduction.</p>
      <p>The British heavyweight veteran is still fighting for one more world title shot and after devastating stoppage wins over Artur Szpilka and David Price he is back in the hunt.</p>

      <p>Chisora and Joshua go back to Joshua's days as an amateur at Finchley ABC and his relentless, come-forward style will have arguably been Joshua's biggest test of camp.</p>
      <p>Chisora's manager, David Haye, gave an insight into Joshua's camp and says he is in great shape, although he kept details to a minimum.</p>

      <p>"Dereck is impressed with Joshua," Haye said. "He found him not just in great shape but having trimmed down to the lean muscle, which is what he needed to do if he is to keep out of danger by boxing Ruiz at long range.</p>
      <p>"And although he's taken off the over-muscle, he's still punching damn hard as well as being quick on his feet. Apparently AJ is fully focussed and right back into his boxing"</p>
      <h3>Andrew Tabiti</h3>
      <p>Cruiserweight Tabiti certainly doesn't have the weight behind him that Ruiz does.</p>
      <p>But the 30-year-old, a product of the Mayweather Gym in Las Vegas, is sure to have offered some speed in both feet and hands.</p>

      <p>He suffered his first professional defeat in his 18th fight earlier this year but, like Joshua, is looking to bounce back and he appeared delighted to have the chance to be involved in the camp in a picture shared on <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> .</p>
      <h3>Timothy Moten</h3>
      <p>The shortest member of the camp at 5ft11, Moton provides almost the ideal dimensions to mirror Ruiz.</p>
      <p>The Louisville-born prospect, 5-0 as a professional, is almost an identical weight to the Mexican and just an inch shorter.</p>

      <p>He has shared pictures from Joshua's base in Sheffield and will no doubt be keen to impress as he makes a name for himself in the sport.</p>
      <p>His hand speed is unlikely to be up to the level of Ruiz, but sizing wise he could be a decent comparison for Joshua to measure up.</p>
      <h3>Tom Little</h3>
      <p>British heavyweight Tom Little is a brave man who has sparred with the best.</p>
      <p>As well as doing recent rounds with Dillian Whyte, he has been in the ring with Joshua in his recent camp.</p>
      <p>The 10-7 Traveller has lost his last two fights at the hands of David Price and Daniel Dubois but what he lacks in talent he makes up for in toughness.</p>

      <p>He'll have no doubt proved durable against Joshua and continued to come forward to make him dig deep.</p>
      <p>Little has also respected the loyalty of sparring by declining to reveal any details on his sparring sessions when asked on social media.</p>
      <h3>Albon Pervizaj</h3>
      <p>Pervizaj is probably the most obscure find for Joshua's camp - but it is easy to see why he was given a call-up.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old German, 12-1 with 9 KOs, appears to have fast hand speed in footage of previous fights on YouTube.</p>
      <p>That's something Joshua will want to replicate - as well as learning to stop the vicious left hook which caused the damage to begin last time out.</p>
      <p>Pervizaj seems to have a strong left hook in his locker, and he could be someone able to give Joshua a decent taster for what he will face in Saudi Arabia.</p>
