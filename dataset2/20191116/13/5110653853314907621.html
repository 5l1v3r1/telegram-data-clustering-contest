      <h1>How Michigan-Michigan State evolved into college football's nastiest sibling rivalry</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T13:25:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 13:25</time> by <a rel="author">Bill Bender</a></address>
      <p>The FOX Sports film "Divided We Stand: Michigan vs. Michigan State" premieres this Thursday at 11 p.m. ET on FS1 — and it will take an in-depth look at the football and men's basketball rivalry between the Mitten State schools.</p>
      <p>On the football side, it's difficult to find a nastier rivalry in the last decade. Better rivalries? Sure. Nastier? There aren't too many.</p>
      <p>
        <b>WEEK 12 PICKS: <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/ncaa-football/news/college-football-picks-week-12-oklahoma-georgia-minnesota-playoff/jls3fi3v6zso1kauntdqq9v1x">Straight up</a> | <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/ncaa-football/news/college-football-week-12-picks-spreads/1oyq7kzncgmum13257pwmd5tqr">Against the spread</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>This rivalry has taken on an increasingly nasty tone since Michigan State's Eddie Brown grabbed Desmond Howard at the goal line on a 2-point conversion attempt in 1990. That increased tenfold with the arrival of Michigan State coach Mark Dantonio in 2007. The Spartans have an 8-4 record since in a rivalry previously dominated by the Wolverines, and that relationship will be explored in that documentary.</p>

      <p>Here are the incidents that have inflamed the Michigan-Michigan State football rivalry:</p>
      <h3>'Little brother' is born</h3>
      <p>Michigan rallied to beat Michigan State 28-24 in Mark Dantonio's first season with the Spartans, and Michigan running back Mike Hart made the analogy that Michigan State was like a "little brother getting exciting playing basketball."</p>

      <p>Dantonio had a pointed response where he said, "Pride comes before the fall" and asked if Hart had a "little brother."</p>

      <p>And we're off.</p>
      <h3>Skywriting 101</h3>
      <p>Talk about petty. Michigan athletics paid for a plane to put a skywriting that said "Go Blue" above Spartan Stadium before a game against Bowling Green in 2011. Michigan athletic director Dave Brandon <a href="https://www.mlive.com/lansing-news/2013/09/university_of_michigan_athleti.html">initially denied</a> he instructed the planes to fly above the stadium in East Lansing, Mich.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, the move backfired.</p>
      <h3>Gholston's dirty plays</h3>
      <p>The Spartans won the next four meetings in the rivalry from 2008-11, but it turned ugly in a 28-14 victory in 2011 when defensive end William Gholston pulled Michigan quarterback Denard Robinson by the facemask and punched Wolverines tackle Taylor Lewan. Gholston was suspended for a game for his actions.</p>

      <h3>'Little sister' is born</h3>
      <p>Michigan State dominated Michigan in 2013 by way of a 29-6 victory. The Spartans sacked Michigan quarterback Devin Gardner seven times and limited the Wolverines to minus-48 rushing yards. Michigan did not score a touchdown, and it turned up the heat on coach Brady Hoke — whose teams made it worse the following season. Toward the end of the game, Michigan State fans chanted, "Little Sister!" at the Wolverines.</p>
      <h3>StakeGate</h3>
      <p>The Wolverines returned to Spartan Stadium the following season as part of a scheduling quirk, and Michigan linebacker Joe Bolden drove a stake into the ground at midfield before the game. Dantonio explained the decision to tack on an extra touchdown in the final minutes in a 35-11 victory afterward.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Michigan shoved Hoke out the door soon after and hired Jim Harbaugh.</p>
      <h3>Miracle at Michigan (Part 2)</h3>
      <p>Harbaugh and the Wolverines appeared to have a victory in hand at Michigan Stadium. But on the last play, punter Blake O'Neill muffed the snap, and Jalen Watts-Jackson returned it for a touchdown in a stunning 27-23 victory. Michigan State would use that victory to advance to the College Football Playoff.</p>

      <p>The "Surrender Cobra" Michigan fan meme was born and lives on today.</p>

      <h3>Social media warfare</h3>
      <p>Michigan beat Michigan State in 2016, and Harbaugh added more fuel after calling out Dantonio for his comments about "focusing on beating Michigan" in the offseason:</p>

      </figure>
      <p>It was the first example of social media warfare between the coaches, but it worked out in Michigan State's favor here. The Spartans won 14-10 in the 2017 matchup with the help of a driving rainfall.</p>
      <p>That set up the 2018 matchup — and there were more fireworks.</p>
      <h3>Devin Bush and the Spartans' logo</h3>
      <p>Before the 2018 matchup Michigan-Michigan State game, the Spartans' players lined up and walked across the field with arms linked while Michigan players were still warming up — including linebacker Devin Bush.</p>
      <p>Bush took exception and scuffed the Spartans' logo with his cleats afterward.</p>

      <p>Michigan beat Michigan State 21-7, but the controversy wasn't over. Michigan defensive end Chase Winovich dropped a "little brother" after the game.</p>

      <p>Dantonio and Harbaugh <a href="https://www.mlive.com/wolverines/2018/10/jim_harbaugh_doubles_down_on_m.html">traded barbs</a> about Michigan State's intent afterward, and whether or not it was "BS." Dantonio, Harbaugh and Bush were reprimanded by the Big Ten, and <a href="https://www.mlive.com/spartans/2018/10/big_ten_fines_michigan_state_r.html">Michigan State was fined $10,000</a>.</p>
      <h3>What's next?</h3>
      <p>Will there be more this week? Let Michigan's Ambry Thomas queue it up for you.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Dantonio backed that up, <a href="https://www.mlive.com/spartans/2019/11/mark-dantonio-embraces-confrontation-in-rivalry-with-michigan.html">via MLive.com</a>.</p>
      <p>"If you don't like confrontation, this probably isn't a good game to go to, because it's just the way it is," Dantonio said. "It's just natural."</p>
      <p>It really is, and it's never over.</p>
