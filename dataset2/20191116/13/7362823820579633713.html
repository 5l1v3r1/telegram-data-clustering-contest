      <h1>'Teen Mom' star Jenelle Evans in talks to return to MTV series: report</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T13:28:15+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 13:28</time> by <a rel="author">The Sun</a></address>
      <p>"Teen Mom 2" star Jenelle Evans may be making a dramatic return to the MTV reality show.</p>
      <p>The network has apparently been in talks to bring her back to the series after a worrying ratings slide, according to RadarOnline.</p>
      <p>That’s after she was fired from the show when her husband, David Eason, shot and killed the family french bulldog, named Nugget.</p>

      <p>David got the ax in 2018 himself following an apparent homophobic twitter rant.</p>
      <p>But since 27-year-old Jenelle’s departure, viewing figures have tanked and the network is reportedly desperate to deliver better ratings, even if that means bringing back the controversial former cast member.</p>
      <p>A source told <a href="https://radaronline.com/photos/teen-mom-2-crisis-ratings-crash-without-jenelle-mtv-in-talks-to-bring-her-back/">Radar</a>: “Jenelle has been talking to MTV and it has been about her coming back.”</p>

      <p>After her sacking Jenelle initially remained with David, even after Child Protective Services reportedly temporarily removed her children from their custody.</p>
      <p>But she recently posted on Instagram that she has filed for divorce from him after two years of marriage.</p>
      <p>RadarOnline reports she dumped David because he doesn’t work and she was broke without her hefty MTV paycheck.</p>

        </a>
      </p>
      <p>That led to him threatening to release "jaw-dropping" information and vowing, "<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10348742/david-eason-threatens-jenelle-evans-divorce/">the truth will come out</a>."</p>
      <p>The mom-of-three to Jace, Kaiser and Ensley also revealed she had taken a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10307786/janelle-evans-ex-david-eason-ring-restraining-order/">temporary restraining</a> order against David.</p>
      <p>She said: “Because of his recent threats, his history of violence, his erratic behavior and his large stockpile of weapons, I am scared for my life and my children’s well-being.”</p>

      <p>Jenelle claimed that after she went out of town and arranged for childcare without telling him, David went into a terrifying rage.</p>
      <p>He apparently texted her a photo of a man writing: “This is your new boyfriend. I’m going to break his neck and feed you his head. My goal in life is to make sure you regret leaving me like this.”</p>
      <p>She also claimed David screamed at her earlier this year: “You can die for all I care. You’re a piece of s**t. Biggest piece of s**t I’ve ever seen,” according to multiple reports.</p>

      </p>
      <p>But all this disturbing drama is apparently not stopping MTV from considering Jenelle joining the cast again in an attempt to reverse the sliding ratings.</p>
      <p>That’s down from last season’s 1.18 million premiere. And the numbers aren’t getting any better.</p>
      <p>TVByTheNumbers.com reports the series sunk to a season-low of 650,000 last month.</p>
