      <p><b>Hydrates the hair<br/></b>Lack of moisture is one of the major reasons for hair that is dull, dry and damaged. The rich fatty acids present in ghee nourish the scalp and hair follicles from within giving it the much-needed boost of hydration, restoring the hair’s health.<br/><b>Improves hair texture<br/></b>Applying ghee directly onto the hair and scalp can improve the texture and giving you hair that extra smooth texture and shine. Simply, heat a spoonful of ghee to melt it slightly. Dip your fingers into it and rub gently on your scalp and hair. Let it sit for a few hours and wash with shampoo thoroughly.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Calms the frizz down</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ghee has an oily texture which works wonders to improve the texture of your hair drastically. Not only does it calm the frizz down but also smoothens your tresses, adding that extra shine and bounce to your locks. Melt enough ghee in a container for your hair and apply while still warm. Allow it to stay for 30 minutes and wash off using warm water and a mild shampoo.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Repairs split ends</b>
      </p>
      <p>One of the reasons for having split ends is also undernourished hair. Rich in vitamins A, D, K2, E and antioxidants, makes ghee extremely beneficial when it comes to nourishing split ends. Warm enough ghee and apply it onto the ends of your tresses. After an hour or so, rinse with a mild shampoo and cold water.</p>
