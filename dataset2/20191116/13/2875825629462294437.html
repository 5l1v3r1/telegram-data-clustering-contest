      <p>Lotto players in Dublin have been urged to check their tickets this morning after one lucky player scooped €500,000 on last night's  <a href="https://www.dublinlive.ie/all-about/euromillions">Euromillions</a>  Plus draw.</p>
      <p>The winning ticket was sold at the Spawell Autostop service station on the Tallaght Road in Dublin 6W.</p>
      <p>Store manager Martin Gacal said the excitement in the store was "unbelievable" this morning, <a href="https://www.dublinlive.ie/news/dublin-news/lucky-south-dublin-player-scoops-17267999">Dublin Live reports.</a></p>
      <p>He said: "As word gets around the area about the win, we have been inundated with people dropping in to check their tickets.</p>
      <p>"We are situated on a busy road and we have lots of commuters passing by each and every day so the winner could literally be anybody.</p>
      <p>"Whoever the winner is, we wish them all the best of luck and we hope that they enjoy their new found fortune."</p>
      <p>The winning EuroMillions Plus numbers for last night’s draw were 01, 06, 32, 36, 44</p>
      <p>There was no winner of last night's mega jackpot of €114m. Next Friday's prize will roll over to an eye-watering €125m.</p>
