      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 16 — Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia Youth chief Syed Saddiq Abdul Rahman has apologised to youths today after Pakatan Harapan (PH) lost the Tanjung Piai by-election.</p>
      <p>The Muar MP said the anger from the loss must prompt a response.</p>
      <p>“This loss is bitter to swallow. The people have spoken. The voice of the people is a hallowed voice.</p>
      <p>“My sincerest of apologies to the Malaysian youths for my schortcomings,” he posted on his Twitter account.</p>

      <p>Barisan Nasional (BN) has trounced PH in the Tanjung Piai by-election today with a whopping majority of 15,086 votes, unofficial final result from the Election Commission showed.</p>
      <p>BN’s candidate Datuk Seri Wee Jeck Seng from MCA received 25,466 votes over PH’s Karmaine Sardini from Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia, who received 10,380 votes.</p>
      <p>Syed Saddiq was criticised for a gaffe when he referred to Karmaine as “arwah Haji Karmaine”, which translates into English as “the late Haji Karmaine”, and for announcing a RM4 million sports infrastructure allocation for the constituency during campaigning.</p>
