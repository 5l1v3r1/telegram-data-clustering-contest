      <h1>'It was best' - Newcastle United injury verdict might surprise Aston Villa fans</h1>
      <h2>Aston Villa latest news | Dean Smith's side welcome Steve Bruce and the Magpies to Villa Park on November 25 when the Premier League returns from the international break</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T13:23:42+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 13:23</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Cusack</a></address>
      <p>Newcastle United will cope just fine without captain Jamaal Lascelles, according to former player Malcolm Macdonald.</p>
      <p>Lascelles <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/newcastle-united-injury-news-lascelles-17255733">suffered a serious knee injury in a tussle with AFC Bournemouth striker</a> Callum Wilson during the 2-1 defeat of Eddie Howe's side at St James' Park on Saturday.</p>
      <p>He was replaced by Paul Dummett after 20 minutes and as a result Newcastle will be without him for at least six weeks - obviously ruling him out of the <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa Park</a> trip on November 25 when the Premier League returns after the international break.</p>
      <p>Lascelles hadn't missed a single game for <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/steve-bruce">Steve Bruce</a> 's side, but they are well stocked at centre-back with Florian Lejeune set to return from injury and former Villan Ciaran Clark hitting form again.</p>

      <p>Macdonald wrote in his column for <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/newcastle-united-can-cope-losing-17262479">ChronicleLive</a> : "When a football club loses its skipper for the rest of the year it's normally a huge blow."</p>
      <p>"However with respect to Jamaal Lascelles if Newcastle United had to be robbed of a senior player for a long while it was best that it was a central defender.</p>
      <p>"Because United are so well off at the back.</p>
      <p>"Think of it, Ciaran Clark, Federico Fernandez and Paul Dummett - none automatic selections - have come in recently and all have been absolutely outstanding.</p>
      <p>"And two quality performers in Fabian Schar and Florian Lejeune are just about to return from injury so United can stand the absence of Lascelles.</p>
