      <p>Here’s hoping Kylie Jenner and Anastasia Karanikolau never fall out – because the pair have matching tattoos of Kylie’s daughter, Stormi’s name on their arms.</p>
      <p>Anastasia, also known as Stassie, got matching tattoos with Kylie back in May, but she showed off the ink this week as she visited an art gallery in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>We’re just going to go out there and say it – it’s a little odd to have your bestie’s kid’s name tattooed on you, isn’t it?</p>
      <p>While <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/27/kylie-jenner-stassi-recreate-britney-spears-madonnas-iconic-kiss-halloween-10990721/">Kylie and Stassie are the best of friends now</a>, their closeness only accelerated after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/08/jordyn-woods-admits-doesnt-core-friend-group-since-fell-kylie-jenner-11068460/">Kylie’s former BFF, Jordyn Woods, was unceremoniously dumped from the Kardashian fold.</a></p>
      <p>Kylie used to be as inseparable from Jordyn as she now is with Stassie, until rumours surfaced that Jordyn had kissed Tristan Thompson, who was dating Kylie’s sister Khloe Kardashian.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Given how quickly that friendship ended – and Jordyn had to move out of Kylie’s house, where she had been living – at least she didn’t have to get any friendship tattoos lasered off.</p>
      <p>Oh wait – yes she did.</p>

      <p>Jordyn and Kylie had both had tiny ‘m’ letters inked on the inside of their little fingers in red ink in May 2016. Awkward.</p>
      <p>Kylie and Stassie had shared footage of them getting their matching Stormi tattoos in May, which was done at Travis Scott’s birthday party.</p>
      <p>Celebrity tattoo artist JonBoy is the one who did the tattoos according to Page Six, and Kylie also has a matching butterfly tattoo on her ankle with Stormi’s dad, Travis.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/15/kylie-jenner-travis-scott-handling-co-parenting-really-well-following-split-10922036/">Kylie and Travis also broke up two years into their relationship,</a> so we think the lesson in all of this is that unless you’re a million per cent certain your connection to a person is unbreakable, maybe get some friendship bracelets rather than a tattoo…</p>
