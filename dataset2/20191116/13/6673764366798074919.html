      <p>Point guard Tatsuya Ito provide a big spark for the Osaka Evessa in a pivotal stretch of the fourth quarter on Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Ito’s dynamic play coincided with Osaka’s most dominant stretch of the game — a 13-0 run that began late in the third quarter and extended into the final stanza — against the Nagoya Diamond Dolphins at Aichi Prefectural Gymnasium.</p>
      <p>Osaka extended its winning streak to five with an 81-61 rout of Nagoya.</p>
      <p>The Evessa, who led 64-52 entering the fourth, received a big boost from Ito to begin the final period, when he scored nine of his 16 points.</p>
      <p>Ito made an inside jumper and buried a 3-pointer to put Osaka (10-4) ahead 69-52 with 9:12 left in the game. Moments later, he sank an outside jumper to extend the lead to 73-52.</p>
      <p>The aforementioned spurt gave the Evessa a 75-52 lead, their biggest advantage of the game.</p>
      <p>Richard Hendrix, a University of Alabama alum, led Osaka with 23 points and 15 rebounds. Ira Brown, who attended Gonzaga University, contributed 19 points and Josh Harrellson and Shota Konno both had nine.</p>
      <p>Shuto Ando scored 11 points for Nagoya (8-7), followed by Taito Nakahigashi and Hilton Armstrong with 10 apiece.</p>
      <p>After the game, Evessa coach Kensaku Tennichi reflected on his team’s overall performance in its first 14 games of the season.</p>
      <p>“I think we have been able to step up more than when (the season) opened, and I think it will be even better in the future,” Tennichi told reporters. “The season is just beginning, so the whole team will fight for the top.”</p>
