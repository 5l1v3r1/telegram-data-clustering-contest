      <h1>GIMPA holds counselling session for students </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T13:20:30+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 13:20</time> by <a rel="author">Kodjo Adams, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Accra, Nov. 15, GNA - The Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration (GIMPA) has organised a counselling session to improve the emotional and physical wellbeing of students to aid their academic work.</p>
      <p>The students were taken through physical wellness activities, including body mass measurements, blood pressure and blood sugar readings.</p>
      <p>The emotional activities include deep muscle relaxation techniques, biofeedback sessions, painting, watching of a blockbuster movies and arm chair massages.</p>
      <p>The event, dubbed, "Self-Care Day" was also to create awareness about the importance of counselling in schools for sound and effective studies.</p>
      <p>It was organised by the GIMPA Counselling Centre in partnership with the GIMPA Clinic.</p>
      <p>Professor Anthony Sallah, the Dean of GIMPA students, in an interview with the Ghana News Agency, in Accra, said the exercise, the second so far, would be sustained to ensure the total wellbeing of children at all times.</p>
      <p>He said as students, they were prone to socio-economic challenges, such as academic and relationship issues and family and health concerns.</p>
      <p>It behoved the School to intervene to ensure that it did not get out of control.</p>
      <p>Prof Sallah gave an instance where a student of the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology committed suicide because of his poor academic results, saying the student could have avoided the act with proper counselling.</p>
      <p>He urged other educational institutions to establish a Counselling Centre to provide the needed psychological and mental support to students.</p>
      <p>He encouraged the students to eschew acts of indiscipline but focus on their studies and visit the Centre when they were faced with problems, saying, "a problem shared is half solved".</p>
      <p>Some of the students who spoke with the Ghana News Agency expressed satisfaction with the programme, stressing it helped calm their nerves and improved academic learning.</p>
      <p>"It is a mind blowing and refreshing exercise to relax the mind and focus on our studies," one them said.</p>
      <p>Mr Thompson Agbodo, a National Service person at the Centre, said the programme had helped enlightened students to be calm ahead of their exams.</p>
