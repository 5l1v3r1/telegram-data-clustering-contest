      <p>The NFL wasted little time in beginning to punish the Browns and Steelers for the <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/steelers-browns-live-score-updates-highlights-thursday-night-football/r6xyx2seq57j1h7obct9hqik3">wild Thursday night brawl</a> that included Cleveland defensive end Myles Garretttearing off the helmet of Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph and hitting him in the head with it.</p>
      <p>Late Friday morning, a little over 12 hours after the fight, <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/myles-garrett-suspension-helmet-swing-browns-steelers-fine/p6a4y3lcs6841h6yyhthae7t2">the league announced a series of fines</a> and suspensions for players involved, but there is more fallout coming, per the statement. Below is an updated list of all suspensions and fines as a result of the Thursday night melee.</p>
      <p>
        <b>'THAT'S ASSAULT': <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/myles-garrett-hit-mason-rudolph-helmet-steelers-browns-melee/t713now08dkh16omshy9umg2f">NFL players react to Myles Garrett's helmet-swinging attack</a></b>
      </p>
      <h3>Steelers-Browns brawl suspensions, fines</h3>
      <h4>Myles Garrett: indefinite suspension</h4>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, Myles Garrett received the <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/myles-garrett-helmet-suspension-legal-action/m0x1ofyyrljw107t55wyl5117">longest suspension of anybody involved</a> in the brawl. The third-year DE's indefinite suspension will keep him out of at least the final six games of the 2019 season and any potential postseason games. After that, his reinstatement is contingent on a meeting with commissioner's office, the NFL's announcement <a href="https://twitter.com/NFLfootballinfo/status/1195383502113509378">read</a>.</p>
      <p>The suspension is without pay and came with a fine of an undisclosed amount. Officially, the suspension is for violating "unnecessary roughness and unsportsmanlike conduct rules, as well as fighting, removing the helmet of an opponent and using the helmet as a weapon.</p>
