      <p>For sale: Buddhist temple. Set on 2.4 hectares, featuring a grand archway, meditation centre and lotus pond. Must sell quickly due to millions in unpaid debts racked up by the head monk.</p>
      <p>You'll find the Linh Son temple in a Reservoir industrial park about 12 kilometres north of central Melbourne, just across the road from a smash repairs business.</p>

      <p>For 28 years, the temple was a place in the northern suburbs where Vietnamese Buddhists could worship and celebrate holy festivals like Tet. The man in charge of the temple was a robed monk named Master Dao.</p>
      <p>But now the gates have been padlocked after the spiritual leader engaged in a series of speculative property deals that backfired terribly for his congregation.</p>
      <p>"It is clear Master Dao made a series of naive, ill-informed decisions based on advice from self- interested individuals," says the temple's lawyer, Chris Ford.</p>
      <p>The money lenders are in the temple after the Melbourne Linh Son Buddhist Society failed to pay back loans worth tens of millions of dollars.</p>

      <p>The debts helped the society amass a considerable property portfolio, which included large packages of development land in Melbourne's west.</p>
      <p>But to say the real-estate play was risky would be putting it mildly. Under Master Dao's leadership, millions in high-interest non-bank finance was advanced by a series of lenders you won't find on the ASX.</p>
      <p>One list of properties shown to <i>The Age</i> suggested the temple owned at least 12 properties, including 63 hectares in Mount Cottrell, before the house of cards came tumbling down.</p>
      <p>Unable to meet the onerous monthly repayments, the temple and Master Dao became embroiled in legal action.</p>

      <p>Last Wednesday, the congregation was exiled from the temple, possibly forever. Accounting company Hall Chadwick is preparing to sell the property on behalf of the mortgagee.</p>
      <p>The ousting was not a surprise. The threats go back to the start of the year, when another money lender was claiming $8 million be repaid.</p>
      <p>Eviction was avoided on that occasion as the debt was refinanced. <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p515q3.html">Before getting his money back</a>, lawyer Peter Schwartz said Master Dao had "bitten off more than he could chew" as a property mogul.</p>
      <p>"He should stick to the beads, as they say," he said.</p>

      <p>Seven months later, Attila Kelemen, the broker who took control of the debt, wants his money back. A warrant sent to the sheriff sought payment of $10.3 million, as well as possession of the temple.</p>
      <p>A full picture of the temple's money woes remains patchy. The most recent financial documents are overdue to be filed with the charity authority. Master Dao stood down as society president in July.</p>
      <p>As the situation became dire, the temple hired insolvency advisor Wayne Fraser to manage its finances.</p>
      <p>He says Master Dao resisted some of his advice to sell property and recover its own outstanding debts.</p>

      <p>Other creditors have taken action in the Supreme Court in recent months demanding payment of seperate debts of $13.5 million and $4.6 million.</p>
      <p>The Master himself is being pursued in the County Court, along with the temple, for $27 million for failing to settle on a real estate purchase in Sunbury.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, the interest on the debts continues to grow.</p>
      <p>The society, which has around 2000 members, took in just over $100,000 in donations last year. Rooms at the temple were also rented out, offering "enlightened living".</p>
      <p>"Initially, my first observation was that there was ridiculous amounts of debt," Mr Fraser says.</p>
      <p>"The thing that was most overwhelming is that they were paying 96 per cent interest, which is crazy.</p>
      <p>"It's just Monopoly money, they're way insolvent. You can accrue as much interest as you like but there's no money left to pay it."</p>
      <p>It is unclear why the Master embarked on his property splurge to begin with. Also known as Duc Thang Nguyen, Master Dao emigrated from Vietnam to Australia in 1992.</p>

      <p>He has avoided all interviews, preferring to be contacted through his lawyers. Photos taken at the temple show him leading his congregation wearing his yellow and red robes.</p>
      <p>"Temple members are hard working, genuine people with limited resources," says the society's lawyer Chris Ford.</p>
      <p>"They practise a philosophy and come together to worship. The temple is a social hub.</p>
      <p>"This current situation is most unfortunate and has caused much distress."</p>
