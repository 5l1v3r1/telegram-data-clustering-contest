      <h1>Don’t Even Think Wildest Hunter season one battle pass now available</h1>

      <p>Look, Don’t Even Think is not a good battle royale game even it is free to play. That’s our opinion here but some people enjoy playing the game and that’s fine. People have different tastes. If you are one of those people then you might be happy to know that the Wildest Hunter season one battle pass is now live which adds new skins for both human and werewolf characters as well as weapon skins. There’s also a new level up system so you can get up the season ranks faster.</p>

      <p>If you really want to know our opinions here’s what Jim said in the review:</p>
      <blockquote>We’ve seen some bad permutations of the battle royale genre, but this one takes the dog biscuit. Don’t Even Think is an opportunistic trainwreck that, while free to play, will leave you feeling emotionally out of pocket.</blockquote>
