      <p>Paris police on Saturday fired tear gas to drive back protesters marking the first anniversary of anti-government "gilets jaunes" ("yellow vest") demonstrations.</p>
      <p>On the Place d'Italie in southern Paris, demonstrators, many clad in black and hiding their faces, set bins on fire and hurled projectiles at riot police while building barricades.</p>
      <p>An HSBC bank branch was attacked, two cars were overturned, a scooter and car were on fire and police responded with tear gas and a water cannon.</p>
      <p>Paris police prefect Didier Lallement cancelled permission for a scheduled demonstration in view of the violence.</p>
      <p>"Our response will be very firm. All those who are hiding their face, all those who are throwing stones are going to be called in for questioning," he told a news conference.</p>
      <p>The authorities said that 147 people had been detained by 20:00 CET.</p>
      <p>Clashes also broke out between demonstrators and police near the Porte de Champerret as protesters were preparing to march across town towards Gare d'Austerlitz.</p>
      <p>Police also intervened to prevent a few hundred demonstrators from occupying the Paris ring road, according to Reuters TV footage.</p>
      <p>The protests, named after the high-visibility jackets worn by demonstrators, erupted in mid-November 2018 over fuel price hikes and the high cost of living. The demonstrations spiralled into a broader movement against President Emmanuel Macron and his economic reforms.</p>
      <p>The protests lost strength in recent months, going from tens of thousands of participants to just a few thousand, but the movement's leaders called for people to turn out on Saturday to mark the first anniversary.</p>
      <p>At its peak in late 2018, the movement grew to up to 300,000 people.</p>
      <p>Protests have been banned near tourists spots such as the Eiffel Tower and many subway stations were closed on Saturday.</p>
