      <p>NEWARK, New Jersey (WABC) -- A woman says her 6-month-old daughter came home bruised after falling down the stairs at an unlicensed daycare in Newark.</p>
      <p>Anari Ormond said her daughter Zuri was also bitten by a toddler on Nov. 12.</p>
      <p>The J&amp;A Nursery is a single family home on Eastern Parkway. Ormond said she did not know the daycare was unlicensed at the time.</p>
      <p>Ormond says she got a text from the daycare operator saying, "Hey Anari, call me on your lunch" with no further explanation.</p>
      <p>Ormond says she got on the phone, and was told a two-year-old boy left unattended bit Zuri three times on her stomach. However, things took a turn for the worse after the young mother rushed over to the nursery.</p>
      <p>"She started to get frantic. She started crying and she's just like, 'I went upstairs to get Neosporin and I fell down the steps holding Zuri, and she's severely bruised," Ormond said.</p>
      <p>Police are now investigating.</p>
      <p>The New Jersey Department of Children and Families released the following statement:</p>
      <p>
        <i>"Our records do not show an operating license or registration for J&amp;A Nursery in Newark. Please note that Family Child Care Homes are permitted to operate in New Jersey, without a license, if they are caring for five or fewer unrelated children. However, if programs wish to receive federal subsidies they're required to voluntarily register with DCF and comply with applicable regulations. Providing care for more than five unrelated children requires a child care center license, and operating without such a license may subject the operator to prosecution."</i>
      </p>
      <p>Eyewitness News has been unable to reach the owner of the daycare for comment.</p>
      <p>Doctors confirm Zuri also suffered a minor concussion.</p>
