      <p><b>Lori Loughlin</b> isn’t scheming to flee the country to escape possible prison time. That ridiculous premise can be found in one of this week’s tabloids. <b>Gossip Cop</b> can bust it.</p>
      <p>Loughlin and her husband Mossimo Giannulli are facing as much as 50 years behind bars for their part in the college admissions cheating scandal after being hit with more charges in October. The couple is accused of paying $500,000 in bribes to ensure their daughters got admitted to the University of Southern California. The tabloids often publish <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/lori-loughlin-college-admissions-cheating-scandal-rumors/">false rumors about Loughlin’s role in the scandal</a>, and <b>Gossip Cop</b> has repeatedly debunked phony takes on the subject. .</p>
      <p>The latest example comes from the <i><b>Globe</b></i>. In an article this week, the tabloid asserts Loughlin and Giannulli are planning to jump bail and flee the country rather than face a trial and the prospect of long prison sentences. The outlet quotes a so-called “insider” as saying, “Lori is dead serious about this and has been scouting overseas countries nonstop to see where she wants to set up her new home. She’ll do anything to escape.” The supposed tipster claims the couple has no plans to “stick around like chickens awaiting slaughter.”</p>
      <p>The seemingly made-up source adds, “That means arranging the right transport that will get over the U.S. border safely and into her new environment.” The outlet adds a nice, fake flourish at the end by adding that the insider supposedly said, “Word is, the actress has bought designer luggage, hats, glove, and scarves, so she obviously plans on traveling in style!”</p>
      <p>The tabloid presents a colorful tale that would be more appropriate in a spy novel than in reality. It’s all just so over-the-top and ridiculous. <b>Gossip Cop</b> checked in with a source close to the actress, who found it all as absurd as we do.</p>
      <p>The <i>Globe’s</i> track record on this ever-evolving story is terrible. In September, the tabloid falsely alleged <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/lori-loughlin-husband-college-admissions-trial-plea-deal/">Loughlin was turning on Giannulli to get a plea deal</a>. This conspiracy theory was thoroughly disproven when the couple was hit with the extra charges in October, likely because they have refused to make such a deal. <b>Gossip Cop</b> had already debunked the idea by presenting multiple examples of the couple standing together, which they are still doing today.</p>
      <p>The <i>Globe</i> also clumsily tried to connect the legal case with the actress’s old hit show. In that phony report, the publication claimed former co-star <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/john-stamos-lori-loughlin-full-house-prequel/">John Stamos betrayed Loughlin </a>by pitching a <i>Full House</i> prequel that would leave the actress out. The publication took a molehill’s worth of truth – Stamos commenting on the idea of a prequel – and built a mountain, dragging Loughlin’s name into it for no reason other than to sell papers. <b>Gossip Cop</b> busted this story as well, pointing out that none of the assertions made sense based on Stamos’ statement. The tabloid just can’t be trusted when it comes to anything regarding Loughlin’s legal case.</p>
