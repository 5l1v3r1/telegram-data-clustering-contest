      </p>
      <p>The Foreign Office have updated their travel advice for countries including Germany, France and Spain as the festive season approaches.</p>

      <p>Countries such as Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands are also popular this time of year due to the festivities throughout the cities.</p>
      <p>However, the government has warned Brits to stay vigilant due to the potential risks.</p>
      <p>The advice states: "There is a general threat from terrorism.</p>
      <p>"There may be increased security in place over the festive period, including at Christmas markets and other major events that might attract large crowds.</p>

      <p>"You should remain vigilant and follow the advice of local authorities."</p>
      <p>The travel advice for Spain also warns tourists to remain vigilant during New Year celebrations well, with many flocking to the country for Nochevieja.</p>
      <p>A terror attack at a Berlin Christmas market in 2016 left 12 people dead after a stolen lorry was driven through the streets.</p>
      <p>In 2018, five people were killed following a terrorist attack at Strasbourg's Christmas market.</p>
      <p>Last Christmas, counter-terror chiefs have warned ISIS lone-wolf supporters may target British Christmas markets with knives or vehicle-ramming attacks.</p>
      <p>The twisted fanatics themselves issued a chilling threat by posting a sick picture depicting a slain Santa in a British high street.</p>
      <p>Chilling text at the bottom of the poster reads: “O pigs of the cross, the day is near when your carnage will be gifts for your children.”</p>
      <p>Though the jihadis lost their so-called Caliphate, a large swathe of territory that covered Iraq and Syria, there are fears they still remain a potent terror threat.</p>
      <p>Terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka at Easter are believed to have been carried out by ISIS.</p>
