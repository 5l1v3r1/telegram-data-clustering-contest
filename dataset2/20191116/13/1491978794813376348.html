        <i>• Coach says Marler should have played at loosehead prop<br/>• Also rues not reverting to Farrell-Tuilagi-Slade midfield</i>
      </p>
      <p>The England coach <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/eddie-jones">Eddie Jones</a> has admitted he should have started Joe Marler instead of Mako Vunipola at loosehead prop in the World Cup final.</p>
      <p>England, who were chasing their second title, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/02/england-south-africa-rugby-world-cup-final-match-report">were defeated 32-12 by South Africa in Yokohama</a> and Jones said he was left to rue his decisions.</p>
      <p>“I accept that I made two selection mistakes for the final,” Jones writes in his new autobiography <i>My Life and Rugby</i>, which is being serialised <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/eddie-jones-book-extract-i-got-our-biggest-game-for-four-years-badly-wrong-dt0k5g9cr">in <i>The Times</i></a>.</p>
      <p>“I should have chosen Joe Marler ahead of Mako Vunipola at loosehead prop and reverted to the Owen Farrell-Manu Tuilagi-Henry Slade midfield we used against Australia.</p>
      <p>“George Ford could have come off the bench when we had got into the game. But you never know until the game starts. You use the best available evidence and rely on your gut.”</p>
      <p>After England had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/19/england-australia-rugby-world-cup-match-report">dominated Australia in the quarter-final</a>, they stunned the defending champions New Zealand <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/26/england-new-zealand-rugby-world-cup-semi-final-match-report">in the semi‑final</a> and Jones fielded the same starting XV that beat the All Blacks against South Africa, but the move backfired.</p>
      <p>“I had been right against Australia and New Zealand but, as it turned out, in the biggest game of our four-year cycle, I got it badly wrong. Hindsight is a wonderful teacher,” Jones said.</p>
      <p>Jones said the big challenge he faced before the final was dealing with the praise that came his players’ way after the New Zealand victory.</p>
      <p>“There’s also a psychological challenge after the kind of big win we achieved against the All Blacks,” he said.</p>
      <p>“While we did play well, I thought the analysis was a bit over the top. Everyone was slapping us on the back, saying how fantastic we were, how it was the best ever performance by an England team and the best ever win at a World Cup.</p>
      <p>“The praise was everywhere. The challenge is to bring the players back to reality. It changes the structure and narrative of the week.”</p>
