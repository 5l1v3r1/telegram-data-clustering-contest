      <h2>Former Chelsea manager Antonio Conte has been on the receiving end of a threatening letter prompting police to give him protection</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T13:50:06+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 13:50</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Former Chelsea boss Antonio Conte is receiving police protection after being sent a bullet in the post, according to reports in Italy.</p>
      <p>Conte, now manager of Inter Milan, received the item along with a letter and a series of anonymous threats, according to Corriere della Sera and Gazzetta dello Sport.</p>
      <p>The well-known act of intimidation has seen him given police protection outside his home and at the Inter training ground whilst an investigation is launched.</p>
      <p>Authorities are said to be taking the matter very seriously, coming after complaints from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> ultras after their former boss took the job with their arch rivals.</p>

      <p>Conte splashed the cash in the summer, bringing in out of favour <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> duo Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez as well as Uruguayan defender Diego Godin in a bid to close the gap to Juventus.</p>
      <p>They have got their season off to a promising start, trailing Juve by just a single point at the top of the table with 31 points from their opening 12 Serie A games.</p>
      <p>Conte played over 300 games for Juventus between 1991 and 2004 before managing them between 2011 and 2014.</p>

      <p>After a spell as Italy boss, he guided <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> to Premier League glory in 2016/17 and won the FA Cup the following year before heading back to Italy.</p>
      <p>Inter return to action next weekend after the international break as they head to Turin to take on Torino.</p>
