      <h1>Myles Garrett's helmet swing hurt Mason Rudolph, damaged the Browns and wrecked his own budding stardom</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T13:43:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 13:43</time> by <a rel="author">Mike DeCourcy</a></address>
      <p>For 59 minutes and 52 seconds, Myles Garrett was the best player on the field at FirstEnergy Stadium as the Browns manhandled the Pittsburgh Steelers. He might have been the best football player in any NFL game this season.</p>
      <p>Storming in from the right defensive end, Garrett had done the job of terrorizing the QB spectacularly and probably had earned a chance to rest for the meaningless final series. He was still out there, though, and the third of those empty snaps will follow him the rest of his career.</p>

      </p>
      <p>There will be no Pro Bowl for Garrett, an honor he’d earned in his second season and was bound to duplicate with this season’s 10 sacks. There will be no playoffs, something that at least seemed in reach before Garrett chose to 1) execute a too-late, unnecessarily violent hit on Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph with less than 10 seconds remaining; 2) respond to Rudolph’s anger and attempt to dislodge Garrett’s headgear by yanking Rudolph’s facemask and pulling the helmet off his head and 3) swinging that helmet at Rudolph and striking him at full force with the open end.</p>
      <p>One can only imagine — though one might prefer not — the damage that could have been done to Rudolph’s skull had Garrett struck with the crown of the helmet.</p>
      <p>Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield drew some criticism for an interview with Erin Andrews of Fox Sports soon after the game ended in which he labeled Garrett’s actions as "inexcusable," acknowledged the impending suspension that would result and declared "that hurts our team."</p>
      <p>He absolutely is correct. Garrett has been suspended by the NFL for the remainder of the 2019 season. The Browns'pursuit of the playoffs will be affectedby the absence of a pass rusher as dominant as Garrett. They have a favorable remaining schedule, with only one game left against a team with a winning record, but they no longer have their superstar defensive end.</p>
      <p>The Browns still can continue competing, though, and Rudolph escaped with no apparent injury. Which means the party who sustained the greatest damage as a result of Myles Garrett’s irresponsible actions was Myles Garrett.</p>
      <p>He is in only his third season after being chosen with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2017 draft. He was doing so much to justify that selection, albeit spiced with periodic, unnecessary extracurriculars that eroded his reputation in the league.</p>
      <p>This will damage that reputation forever.</p>
      <p>He will be remembered with the likes of Albert Haynesworth, Wayne Maki and Kermit Washington, all of whom engaged in conduct well beyond the boundaries of their respective sports. One difference that favors Garrett is that his actions did not result in serious injury for his victim. What inevitably will impact him, though, is HD video of him striking Rudolph with a football helmet that will endure on YouTube, Twitter and other online media outlets.</p>
      <p>When Maki and Ted Green engaged in a stick fight that resulted in Green being struck and nearly dying of a fractured skull, the Boston television station that aired the game reportedly ordered the tape of that telecast destroyed because it did not want such violence to be widely distributed. Washington’s punch in a 1977 NBA game nearly killed Rudy Tomjanovich and led to a two-month suspension for Washington. There was not even an ESPN at that point to debate whether the penalty was appropriate.</p>

      <p>When Garrett swung that helmet, it was seenmostly by Browns fans elated by their team’s victory and those simply waiting for the local news. The game was over. That moment never will be, though, because he'll always be the guy who did something most hadnever seen on a football field — but somethingnearly everyonehas now seen replayed on Facebook or Instagram.</p>
      <p>Garrett ended this game with one solo tackle and three quarterback hits, numbers that show how limited a story basic statistics can tell to those who did or did not witness the evening’s activities. They do not account for the two holding penalties assigned to Steelers Pro Bowl tackle Alejandro Villanueva, nor for the four interceptions thrown by Rudolph because he was given so little time to think.</p>
      <p>A loss would have ended the Browns'season, and they played with all the motivation such a circumstance engenders — Garrett more than anyone. He made Villanueva look like a Division III backup. He robbed all the pocket comfort Rudolph had come to expect while being sacked roughly once per game in his previoussix starts.</p>
      <p>Who’s been better in an NFL game this year? DeShaun Watson with his five TD passes against the Falcons? OK, but it was the Falcons. Christian McCaffrey with 237 yards from scrimmage against Jacksonville? Maybe.</p>
      <p>Garrett did not need numbers to be impactful. He only needed to play as he did. And that is the shame of this, because he did not need to go over the line at the end to have left his mark. The Steelers were going to fear seeing him againhad he never resorted to dubious hits and blunt instruments. Now, he can watch the game on TV if he chooses. And if he does, he can be certain they’ll show what he did. Again. And again.</p>
