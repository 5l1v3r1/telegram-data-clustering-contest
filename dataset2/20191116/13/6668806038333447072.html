      <p>Marjaavan created a lot of hype ever since its trailer was released online sometime back. Judging from the film’s trailer, it seemed like Marjaavaan would be a mass action entertainer.</p>

      <p>Coming to the box-office collections of the film, Marjaavaan managed to make approximately Rs 6.50 to 7 Crore on the first day. The film managed to perform well in tier 2 and tier 3 cities in centres like Maharashtra, Gujarat, CP Berar, Nizam, UP and Bihar. However, Marjaavaan didn’t manage to impress the audience in the metropolitan cities. <br/><br/>The Milap Zaveri starrer features Sidharth Malhotra, Tara Sutaria, Riteish Deshmukh and Rakul Preet Singh in lead roles. Marjaavaan also brings back Sidharth and Riteish’s pairing after Ek Villain (2014).</p>
