      <p>A stray puppy who became famous because of her human-like eyebrows has found a home after being rejected by her first owners for being 'weird'.</p>
      <p>Betty, five months old, was found wandering the streets of a Siberian city.</p>
      <p>A local animal shelter staff gave her a "good wash" thinking the markings were painted on her as a "cruel joke".</p>
      <p>But they turned out to be real, winning the dog a new home and fame.</p>
      <p>Keeper Olesya Novopoltseva said: "I’ve been working here at the shelter for a very long while but never saw anything like this."</p>
      <p>She cared for the stray when she was brought in from the street.</p>

      <p>Nadezhda Grozetskaya, a vet in Bratsk city, confirmed the eyebrows were not fake.</p>
      <p>The unusual pigmentation was ‘nature’s joke’, she said.</p>
      <p>"This is the case of hair pigmentation which doesn’t depend on a (particular) breed.</p>

      <p>"I actually cried when I saw a post about her," said Oksana.</p>
      <p>"She had to become my dog."</p>
      <p>Shelter staff had initially named her Frida in a tribute to Mexican painter Frida Kahlo with her dark “unibrow”.</p>
