      <p>Today, the youngest of the Bachchans celebrates her 8th birthday. Like every year, this year as well Bachchans have organised a themed party to celebrate dear Aradhya's special day.</p>
      <p>Celebs like <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Shah-Rukh-Khan">Shah Rukh Khan</a>, Gauri, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Riteish-Deshmukh">Riteish Deshmukh</a>, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Karan-Johar">Karan Johar</a>, Genelia, and their kids have been snapped as they made their grand entries at the venue. While browsing the internet, we stumbled upon a beautiful picture of Aaradhya with mom Aishwarya from the birthday party.</p>
      <p>In the picture, we can see the pretty <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/birthday-girl">birthday girl</a>, Aaradhya posing with her fellow friends from the industry. Going by the decorations in the backdrop, we can make out that it is a neon themed birthday party. While Aaradhya looked pretty in her pink cinderella dress which has some floral detailing over it, Ash looked stunning as always.</p>
