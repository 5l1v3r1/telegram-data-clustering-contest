      <h1>First Lady appeals to parents to be more responsible</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T13:26:57+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 13:26</time> by <a rel="author">Eunice Hilda Ampomah, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Accra, Nov. 15, GNA – First Lady Mrs Rebecca Akufo-Addo, on Friday, appealed to parents and guardians to be more responsible towards children under their care, as negligence of their parental duties could jeopardise the bright future of the children.</p>
      <p>She said some parents and guardians gave little or no attention to the welfare of their children as a result of factors such as poverty, broken homes, and other personal emotional issues, an act she said was unjustifiable and unacceptable.</p>
      <p>“It is a shared responsibility on all of us to ensure that we provide every child with a strong foundation to enable them unleash their full potential and contribute to national development.”</p>
      <p>She made the appeal at the launch of “The Hike,” a fundraising hiking event organised by SOS Children’s Villages, Ghana and the Netherlands office in Accra.</p>
      <p>Mrs Akufo-Addo said the family was a foundation for building a strong society and its structure played a pivotal role in the development of a child.</p>
      <p>“Families are the centre of our lives. The Foundation that family gives us determine how we live our lives, make our decisions, shape our attitudes and level of awareness on societal issues,” she said.</p>
      <p>She, therefore, urged parents to prioritise the welfare, security, and development of their children, saying, “A healthy homeland is clearly a vital ingredient in the pursuit of a meaningful life.”</p>
      <p>She commended SOS Children especially members who travelled from the Netherlands to support vulnerable children through the hiking, saying their generosity would forever remain in the hearts and minds of those children, their families and the nation at large.</p>
      <p>Ms Arian Buurman, National Director of SOS Children’s Villages, The Netherlands, commended SOS Ghana for the various projects and programmes implemented to guard children and enable them to realise their potentials.</p>
      <p>On her part, members from her office were willing to cooperate with the Ghana office to touch more lives of deprived children.</p>
      <p>Mr Alex Kekula, the National Director of SOS Children’s Villages, Ghana, explained that funds were generated through registration by participants in the hiking exercise.</p>
      <p>He expressed gratitude to the Netherlands Embassy for its constant support towards the work of his organisation and believing that when Ghanaian children were supported and empowered, they could become responsible and useful assets to the state.</p>
      <p>SOS Children’s Villages is a social development organisation with strong emphasis on child welfare.</p>
