But while his decision may be controversial, it is within his powers to grant clemency, as the Defense Department acknowledged Friday evening. "The Department of Defense has confidence in the military justice system," Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-clemency-army-officers-accused-of-war-crimes-navy-seal-eddie-gallagher">said</a>.
