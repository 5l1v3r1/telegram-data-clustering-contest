      <p>Twitterati have erupted in anger on reports that the Uttar Pradesh Police had arrested journalist Ali Sohrab for one of his objectionable tweet, posted in the immediate aftermath of Hindutva leader Kamlesh Tiwari’s murder. According to reports, the UP Police arrested Sohrab, who owns the Twitter handle @kakavaani, from his Delhi home.</p>

      <p>Lawyer Anas took to Twitter to inform about Sohrab’s arrest. He wrote, “An FIR registered in P.S. Hazratganj, Lucknow has resulted in arrest of @AliSohrab007. Transit remand has been granted. Never agreed with him but we’re keeping an eye on this development. Speaking to lawyers in Lucknow.”</p>
      <p>Anas also said that since none of the charges against Sohrab entailed a punishment of more than three years, getting a bail should not be difficult.</p>
