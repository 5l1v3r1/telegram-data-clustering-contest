      <p>One of the Big Ten’s best rivalries is set to be on display in Ann Arbor in a couple of hours, when Michigan hosts Michigan State.</p>
      <p>The Wolverines come into this afternoon’s game as the favorite, though you never know what you’re going to get when they play the Spartans.</p>
      <p>ESPN’s Football Power Index has made its final prediction for the game. It likes Jim Harbaugh’s squad.</p>
      <p>The Worldwide Leader’s computer doesn’t think it’ll be close.</p>
      <h3>ESPN’s Football Power Index is giving Michigan a 84.2 percent chance of winning this game, giving Michigan State just a 15.8 percent chance of pulling off the upset.</h3>
      <p>Michigan and Michigan State are set to kick off at noon E.T.</p>
