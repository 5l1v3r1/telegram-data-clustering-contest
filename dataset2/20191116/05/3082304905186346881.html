        <b>Arsenal youngster Gabriel Martinelli has been a revelation ever since he was given an opportunity by manager Unai Emery to show his talent for the club’s first team.

      <p>According to <a href="https://www.donbalon.com/futbol/laliga/messi-lo-veto-estrella-mundial-barca-tuvo-cerrado-verano">Don Balon</a>, the La Liga giants were planning to make a move for the 18-year-old. The report adds that they were very close to making an official bid for the forward but Lionel Messi vetoed the move and Martinelli ultimately moved to Arsenal.</p>

      <p>Former Arsenal and Manchester United star Robin van Persie was full of praise for the youngster when he scored in the UEFA Europa League.</p>
      <p>“He knows where the danger is, where the space is,” Robin van Persie said while in conversation with BT Sport after Martinelli scored against Guimaraes.</p>
      <p>“He scored a great goal. What I like about him is his link-up play, he looks lively, he looks technical, he looks very good to me, it’s a joy watching him. Five in five is a great start.”</p>
