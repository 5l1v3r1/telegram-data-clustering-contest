      <p>The Nigerian Bar Association on Friday condemned the Minister of State for Petroleum, Timipre Sylva’s verbal attack on a judge of the Federal High Court.</p>
      <p>A statement signed on behalf of the association by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kunle Edun, noted that the minister made the “indicative and defamatory remarks” while featuring as a guest on a programme on <i>Channels Television</i> on Thursday</p>
      <p>The minister featured on the programme in the wake of the Thursday’s order of the Federal High Court in Yenagoa, the Bayelsa State capital, disqualifying the minister’s party, the All Progressives Congress, from fielding candidates in the governorship election.</p>
      <p>The statement read, in part, “The attention of the NBA has been drawn to a statement made by the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Mr. Timipre Sylva while featuring as a guest on a programme on <i>Channels Television</i> yesterday, November 14, 2019.</p>
      <p>“While commenting on the judgment of the Federal High Court at Yenegoa wherein the court delivered a judgment in the case filed by Senator Heineken Lokpobri and cancelled the Bayelsa State APC primaries, Mr. Timipre Sylva made some indictive and defamatory remarks about the person of the honourable judge of the Federal  High Court who presided over the case. Mr. Sylva was  unsparing in his insult on the learned trial judge.”</p>
      <p>A Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Mr. Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa, on Thursday condemned the minister’s comment including describing the judge as “a bad egg” that should be got rid of in the judiciary.</p>
      <p>Adegboruwa called on the NBA and the National Judicial Council to take action on the comment.</p>
      <p>Describing Sylva’s statement as unbecoming of a minister, the NBA, on Friday, asked him to withdraw it.</p>
      <p>The association also called on the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami (SAN), not to be seen as encouraging disrespect to courts, by always doing the needful in protecting the decisions of courts and judicial officers.</p>
      <p>It stated, “The Nigerian Bar Association considers the statement made by Mr. Timipre Sylva as most unfortunate, uncalled for and unbecoming of a minister of the Federal Republic of  Nigeria.</p>
      <p>“As a one-time state governor, Sylva is expected to appreciate the importance of the judiciary as an independent arm of government and the need to accord respect and dignity to the courts.</p>
      <p>“The general norm is for parties to appeal or challenge an order of court in the proper forum if a party is dissatisfied with same.</p>
      <p>“Resorting to media campaign of calumny against a court of law is contemptuous and not a hallmark of civility.</p>
      <p>“The NBA demands that Mr Timipre Sylva withdraws the offensive statement and apologise to the learned trial judge and the nation’s judiciary, who he has collectively and unjustifiably attacked.</p>
      <p>“The NBA urges the judiciary to do the needful to protect its sanctify, integrity and honour by dealing decisively with cases of open contempt, without delay.</p>
      <p>“The NBA also urges the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, SAN , who is the chief law officer of the federation not to be seen to encourage disrespect to courts, by always doing the needful in protecting the sanctity and respect for the decisions of courts and judicial officers.</p>
      <p>“Nigerians (particularly political actors) must recognise that courts are necessary and vital instruments for entrenching social equilibrium and justice in a society.”</p>
