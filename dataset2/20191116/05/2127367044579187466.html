      <p>Indian bowlers fired in unison as Bangladesh were reduced to 60/4, trailing by 283 runs at lunch on Day 3 of the Indore Test on Saturday. After declaring the first innings at their overnight total of 493/6, Umesh Yadav removed Imrul Kayes early. His opening partner Shadman Islam also did not last long as Ishant Sharma sent him packing in the seventh over. Mohammad Mithun showed some resiliance by hitting four boundaries but he was dismissed by Mohammed Shami. Shami, who put a bowling exhibition on show, was the pick of the bowlers for India as he returned figures of 2/8.Â <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/live-scorecard/india-vs-bangladesh-1st-test-indore-inba11142019190932">(LIVE SCORECARD)</a></p>
