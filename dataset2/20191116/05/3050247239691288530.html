      <h1>These Are The Golden Days Of Crypto Collectibles, Says Fintech Expert</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T05:32:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 05:32</time> by <a rel="author">Hisashi Oki</a></address>
      <p>Speaking on stage at BlockShow Asia 2019 in Singapore, True Global Ventures 3d founder Dusan Stojanovic said the time to invest in crypto collectibles is “right now.”</p>
      <p>Some investors regard Bitcoin as a “safe haven” asset, and see high demand for it in a world of economic uncertainty. But Stojanovic sees the same value in crypto collectibles, especially in the gaming sector. He claimed that such collectibles could function as recession-resistant assets. </p>
      <p>Crypto collectibles are a category of digital asset that are backed by non-fungible tokens — each token is unique and no two are the same. He sees great opportunities for collectibles in the near-term. “I am really bullish about gaming and non-fungible tokens,” he said. “CryptoKitties was the start. I think the timing is right now, way before five years [from now].” </p>
      <p>Stojanovic added that football clubs are “jumping into” the blockchain gaming space right now. Last month, Germany’s FC Bayern Munich <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/fc-bayern-munich-announces-digital-token-to-boost-fan-engagement">announced</a> a partnership with Stryking Entertainment to produce digital collectibles of its players. The Sacramento Kings also recently <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/fc-bayern-munich-announces-digital-token-to-boost-fan-engagement">announced</a> a new collaboration with the creator of Ethereum-based Kaiju toys, CryptoKaiju, to create unique, limited-edition collectibles that are driven by a blockchain.</p>
