      <h1>LETTER: The national debt, Donald Trump and the Fed</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T05:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author">Irene Leitch Bullhead City</a></address>
      <p>In response to Schyler Frost’s recent letter regarding the national debt: Mr. Frost advocates that each taxpayer simply make donations, thereby lessening the debt. This sounds good but is impossible.</p>
      <p>Sen. Rand Paul’s father, former Rep. Ron Paul, called yearly for an audit of the Federal Reserve System which is “federal” in name only and a private corporation of banks. I think we would all be surprised with the results of an audit. The Fed has been in business for more than 100 years. Could the banks own the country?</p>
      <p>The unconstitutional Federal Reserve System was created by Congress in 1913, along with the IRS, to service the debt, which it cannot do. That’s the deficit. Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution gave Congress the power to create money. President Donald Trump is the first president I ever heard even complain about the Fed’s interest rate or, for that matter, say anything against the Federal Reserve.</p>
      <p>Do the banks own the country?</p>
