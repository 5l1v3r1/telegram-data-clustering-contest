      <h1>Mum's anguish over soldier killed on way home from pub after taking a wrong turn</h1>
      <h2>Jamie Staley wanted to travel the world, and had returned from Thailand days before his death</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T05:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author">Anna Lewis</a></address>
      <p>A mother has described the life-shattering moment she learnt of her son's death after he was hit by a lorry walking back to his barracks.</p>
      <p>"Proud" soldier Jamie Staley died in September 2018 after taking the wrong turning walking from <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/monmouth">Monmouth</a> to his training barracks in the early hours of the morning. He was only 20 years old.</p>
      <p>Fresh from his first posting abroad, Jamie had come to Wales after using his leave to spend three weeks in Thailand, pursuing his love of Mai Thai boxing.</p>
      <p>He and his team were due to spend a week in the South Wales countryside walking and trekking in preparation for the gruelling 37-mile Cambrian Patrol mountain exercise.</p>
      <p>But instead of taking a turning along a country road, the Queen's Royal Hussars trooper found himself on the A40 in the early hours of September 22.</p>
      <p>Now, his mother has opened up about the legacy of a young man who loved nothing more than sport and spending time with his younger brothers.</p>

      <p>Mum Stella Martin, who lives in Doncaster, said: "Jamie wanted to travel the world. He had spent his 20th birthday in his posting in Germany.</p>
      <p>"Instead of coming home he had spent his August leave in Thailand and it must have the day that he flew back that he arrived in Wales. He went straight there.</p>
      <p>"I remember speaking to him just as he arrived in Wales since I asked him if he was coming back that weekend."</p>
      <p>Last month, fellow solider Ian Lutaaya described to an inquest how a group of soldier had <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/proud-soldier-hit-lorry-walking-17052419">walked from their barracks to Wetherspoons in Monmouth on the eve of Jamie's death.</a></p>
      <p>There, the soldier was described as "happy and merry" but not "falling or stumbling over his words".</p>
      <p>But when the rest of the regiment decided to return back ahead of curfew, Jamie chose to stay behind with a Monmouth resident he had met during the course of the night.</p>

      <p>In a statement read during Jamie's inquest, Melissa Brooks said: "I began to talk to Jamie and we just clicked.</p>
      <p>"As the evening went on his friends said they had to leave and get back to camp. Jamie said he wanted to stay with me and my friends."</p>
      <p>At around 1.30am, Jamie began to make his way back to his barracks. But instead of turning down the lane home, he found himself on the A40 dual carriageway running parallel.</p>
      <p>Tragically, he was hit by a HGV travelling from Cardiff shortly after reports were made to police of a man "staggering" between lanes.</p>
      <p>Footage from the lorry driver's dashcam found there was 0.6 seconds between seeing a glimpse of Jamie's trainers and the point of collision. He had been travelling at 56mph.</p>
      <p>Stella, who had been working at a pub restaurant at the time of Jamie's death, said: "I had left the pub restaurant and I was in the bar.</p>
      <p>"I was sat there and I saw the police come in and I didn't know what was going on.</p>
      <p>"It was awful. I could never go back after that."</p>

      <p>She added: "I always worried more about Jamie when he turned 18 than I ever had before.</p>
      <p>"He wasn't one to go out drinking until he was 18. When he was in the local pub some people would ring me up to say when Jamie was drunk.</p>
      <p>"He would always say 'I'll be alright' but he obviously wasn't'."</p>
      <p>During the days after Jamie's death, Stella and her family were overwhelmed my hundreds of messages of condolences and love.</p>
      <p>On the day of his funeral, family and friends packed out the church to pay their last respects to a soldier, son and older brother.</p>
      <p>In an obituary posted in the Journal of the Queen's Royal Hussars, tribute was paid to a trooper who was "warm, funny and caring", known for a "witty but dry sense of humour."</p>
      <p>Stella, also mother to Bobby, 15, and Brooklyn, 11, said: "When Jamie was younger originally he wanted to go to a sports academy. Then he wanted to be in the Marines but when he decided to go for the Army he practically flew through it.</p>
      <p>"He was always running, going to the gym.</p>
      <p>"He loved playing football at school and he was managing one of the youth football teams for kids for a little while.</p>
      <p>"He was so good with kids. When he was on leave he would even help with his friends' children.</p>
      <p>"He would message me saying he would pick up their kids from nursery."</p>

      <p>Stella, 39, added: "It took me about three days to go through all the messages after it happened.</p>
      <p>"Some were from people I didn't even know but who knew Jamie."</p>
      <p>Today, Stella is the proud owner of her own café named in her eldest son's honour.</p>
      <p>The café, named Jamie's, proudly sports pictures of the soldier on the walls to keep his memory alive.</p>
      <p>For her, it means her work is now a place for those closest to Jamie to come together and remember.</p>
      <p>Stella said: "There's not one second where I don't think of Jamie.</p>
      <p>"People ask questions when they see the pictures and they don't know what to say when I tell them he's not with us, but we are here because we want to talk about him.</p>
      <p>"I have an old veteran who was in the same regiment as Jamie. He came in and said he had never met someone who had been in the same regiment."</p>
