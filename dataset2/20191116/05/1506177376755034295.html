      <p>Congratulations to Stefanos Tsitsipas who will contest his first ever final in London after beating Roger Federer 6-3, 6-4 in the ATP semi-final.</p>
      <p>After the game, the 21-year-old stated “Wow! Jesus. I’m so proud of myself today. Great performance and once again, people were great. I really enjoyed my time on the court and sometimes matches like this, you wonder to yourself how you overcome all those difficulties, all those break points down. It’s really, like, a mental struggle. So I’m really proud that I managed to save so many break points today. You know, I was trying not to give an easy time to Roger. He was playing good and shout out to him as well. He did pretty well this week in Nitto. I mean, an inspration, obviously, as always. Playing him, it’s the biggest honour I could have. Today’s win, victory is probably one of my best matches of this season. And these are the moments that I always wait for and these are the moments that I want to prove the best out of my game.”</p>
