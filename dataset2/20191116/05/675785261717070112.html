      <h1>Cristiano Ronaldo approves Juventus plan for Paul Pogba transfer from Man Utd</h1>
      <h2>Juventus are weighing up January move for their former player and Ronaldo is reportedly happy for the World Cup winner to join the Bianconeri's ranks</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T05:19:04+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 05:19</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Cristiano Ronaldo has reportedly given Juventus his seal of approval to move for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> midfielder Paul Pogba.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> are weighing up whether to swoop for Pogba in the January transfer window, after the Turin club were linked with the French midfielder throughout the summer.</p>
      <p>The summer window was dominated by speculation around, with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> boss Zinedine Zidane believed to have been keen on taking the World Cup winner to the Bernabeu.</p>
      <p>However, United held firm in their £180million valuation of the 26-year-old midfielder and Pogba stayed at Old Trafford, although he is currently out until early December with an ankle injury.</p>
      <p>Spanish publication <a href="https://eldesmarque.com/madrid/real-madrid/noticias/176093-operacion-pogba-80-millones-y-tu-el-plan-bomba-de-zidane-en-el-real-madrid-ed">El Desmarque</a> claims both Real and Juventus are keen to renew their efforts to sign Pogba.</p>

      <p>And the publication says Juventus ace Ronaldo gave the okay to a move for Pogba after being consulted by the club over the French midfielder.</p>
      <p>Juventus signed Pogba from United on a free transfer in 2012, before selling him back for a then world-record £94.5m four years later.</p>
      <p>El Desmarque also claims Real are pondering whether to test United's resolve with a £150m bid.</p>
      <p>Considering Pogba's indifferent form and his current injury, United may be tempted to sell for less than the £180m they wanted in the summer.</p>

      <p>And according to El Desmarque, Real reckon they can help restore Pogba's best form if they can tempt United into selling.</p>
      <p>The sale of Pogba could help United fund January moves for transfer targets <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-utd-line-up-200m-20889527">Jadon Sancho and Erling Braut Haaland</a></p>
      <p>Borussia Dortmund and England winger Sancho is valued at around £100m, while RB Salzburg and Norway striker Haaland could cost around £85m.</p>
      <p>Despite a clutch of goals and assists already this season, Sancho was hauled off after just 36 minutes of Dortmund's recent clash with title rivals Bayern Munich.</p>
      <p>That came on the back of Sancho being fined by Dortmund for returning late from England duty following last month's international break.</p>
      <p>The feeling at United is there is an opportunity to take advantage of the discord between Sancho and Dortmund, with a January bid that could ultimately suit both parties.</p>
      <p>With Haaland, United hope his relationship with Solskjaer, who managed him at Molde, can give them a head start over their rivals in the race to sign Europe's most prolific young striker.</p>
      <p>Haaland, son of former City and Leeds midfielder Alf-Inge, has made an explosive start to the season, scoring 22 goals in 16 appearances, including seven in the Champions League.</p>
