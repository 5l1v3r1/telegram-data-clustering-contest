      <h1>Bill Gates regains spot as world’s richest person over Jeff Bezos</h1>

      <p>Bill Gates has regained the title of the richest person in the world, surpassing Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos Friday in the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.</p>
      <p>Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, has a net worth of $110 billion, which topped Bezos’ total worth of $109 billion, according to the index.</p>
      <p>Gates briefly held the top spot last month after Amazon suffered a 28 percent drop in profits the three months ending in September, but quickly lost the spot again to Bezos, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/15/tech/bill-gates-jeff-bezos-richest-person/index.html">CNN reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Gates’ ascent to the top spot on Friday was spurred by a 48 percent increase in Microsoft shares, which lifted his net worth, according to CNN.</p>
      <p>Bezos’ wealth was also impacted by his divorce settlement with his former wife MacKenzie. Their divorce settlement <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/07/06/jeff-and-mackenzie-bezos-divorce-is-officially-finalized-with-38b-settlement/?_ga=2.234240286.1298037078.1573512638-601450296.1569880949">left her with 19.7 milion shares</a> of Amazon.com valued at more than $38 billion, according to Bloomberg.</p>
