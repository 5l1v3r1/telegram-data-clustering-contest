      </ul>
      <p>This article is part of a series that provides an ongoing analysis of the changes made to Baupost Group's 13F stock portfolio on a quarterly basis. It is based on Klarman’s regulatory <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1061768/000156761919021196/0001567619-19-021196-index.htm">13F Form</a> filed on 11/14/2019. Please visit our <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/300238-tracking-seth-klarman-s-baupost-group-holdings">Tracking Seth Klarman’s Baupost Group Holdings</a> article for an idea on how his holdings have progressed over the years and our <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4286207-tracking-seth-klarmans-baupost-group-holdings-q2-2019-update">previous update</a> for the fund's moves during Q2 2019.</p>
      <p>Baupost Group’s 13F portfolio value decreased ~20% from $11.05B to $8.83B this quarter. The total number of 13F securities remained steady at 30. The portfolio is heavily concentrated with Liberty Global (NASDAQ:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LBTYK">LBTYK</a>) (NASDAQ:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LBTYA">LBTYA</a>), Fox Corp. (NASDAQ:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FOX">FOX</a>) (NASDAQ:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FOXA">FOXA</a>), ViaSat (NASDAQ:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VSAT">VSAT</a>), eBay Inc.

      <p>Since inception (1982), Baupost Group’s 13F portfolio has accounted for between 2.4% and 15% of the Assets Under Management (AUM). The current allocation is at the high-end of that range. The rest of the AUM is diversified among cash, debt, real estate, and hedges. The fund continues to hold well over a quarter of the AUM in cash. Seth Klarman’s distinct investment style is elaborated in his 1991 book “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=margin%20of%20safety&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=onfasbl02-20&amp;url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks">Margin of Safety: Risk-averse value investing strategies for the thoughtful investor</a>”. The book is out-of-print and copies sell for a huge premium.</p>
