      </p>
      <p>After the earlier controversy about withholding the NSSO Labour Survey showing a spike in unemployment, the Centre has stirred up a new one about the NSSO’s critical Consumer Expenditure Survey, which provides insights on the changes in spending patterns of Indian consumers. The Centre has cited data quality issues with the Survey, which showed a fall in rural consumption.</p>

      <p>Airtel and Vodafone-Idea broke the wrong kind of records, reporting combined losses of over Rs 73,000 crore for the latest September quarter after the Supreme Court’s AGR ruling.</p>

          <i>Consumption gloom</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>The RBI, however, predicted a sharp fall in private final consumption expenditure in its latest survey of professional forecasters who feel that PFCE growth would fall by 250 bps from 8 per cent.</p>

          <i>Food price spike</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Seasonal spikes in vegetable and egg prices seem to have propelled the October 2019 CPI inflation to 4.62 per cent above RBI’s comfort zone of 4 per cent, for the first time in 14 months. Core inflation remains low, while food prices have spiked.</p>
