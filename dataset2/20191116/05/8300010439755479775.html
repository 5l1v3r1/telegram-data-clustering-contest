      <p>COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (KABC) -- When the Chargers leave Colorado for Mexico Sunday, they'll carry with them a sense of urgency.<br/><br/>The Bolts are not happy with a 4-6 record. But a big winning streak to close out the season - especially against their division rivals - can still send them to the playoffs.<br/><br/>"Still being in the hunt is big," said tight end Hunter Henry. "We still play Kansas City two more times."<br/><br/>The peace and serenity of quiet Colorado Springs this week will be replaced Monday in Mexico City with a crowd estimated to be over 100,000 fans.<br/><br/>"Same feeling as when we started the season, and started camp. We know what we got in there (the locker room)" said linebacker Melvin Ingraham.<br/><br/>Head coach Anthony Lynn played a game in Mexico as a running back with the Broncos in the 1990s.<br/><br/>"Mexico is a very rich city." Lynn said. "When you're there for a week, you have a chance to move around," he said.<br/><br/>The Chargers will fly in Sunday, then fly home after Monday's game.<br/><br/>"This is a business trip," he said.<br/><br/>The Chargers' Michael Davis will have 15 family and friends at the game.<br/><br/>He's Mexican and very excited to be going home to play.<br/><br/>In fact he offered some food tips to the media.<br/><br/>"You can come to my grandma's house, and she will make you some fire posole," he said.<br/><br/>Davis went to see a soccer game last year in Mexico in the same stadium they'll be playing the Chiefs Monday.<br/><br/>"I'm proud to represent Mexican culture and my family's name - the Martinez family," he said.<br/><br/>"I got to go out there and just ball out," he said.<br/><br/>The Chargers hope the first step to winning six straight is Monday in Mexico.<br/><br/><i>The Chargers take on the Chiefs in Mexico City on Monday Night Football. The game is airing on ABC7. Coverage begins with a 4:30 p.m. PT pre-game show.</i></p>
