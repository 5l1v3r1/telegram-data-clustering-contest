      <p><b>Critics’ consensus: </b>A muddled story populated with thinly written characters and arranged around a misguided Johnny Depp performance, “The Professor” fails early and often.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h4>“Jexi” — 11%</h4>
      <figure>

      <p><b>Critics’ consensus: </b>It’s hard to tell whether the lack of laughs in “Jexi” is a bug or a feature, but this AI rom-com is sorely in need of an OS update.</p>

      <p><b>Critics’ consensus:</b> “An Acceptable Loss” attempts a political thriller approach to a serious issue, but ends up sacrificing thrills – as well as a satisfying story – in the bargain.</p>

      <p><b>Critics’ consensus:</b> “The Hustle’s” stars might make an effective comedy team in a different setting, but this gender-flipped remake of a remake adds little beyond its feminine twist.</p>
