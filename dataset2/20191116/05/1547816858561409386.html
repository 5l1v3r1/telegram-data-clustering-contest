      <p>Salman Khan is back to school Bigg Boss 13 pulling up contestants about their actions inside the house with other housemates. The controversial show is making headlines like never before. Right from Rashami Desai and Sidharth Shukla’s dushmani to Devloeena Bhattacharjee and Rashami’s dosti, contestants’ equation is seen changing every day. But looks like this Weekend Ka Vaar is going to be intriguing as contestants- Hindustani Bhau and Vishal Aditya Singh can be seen locking horns with each other in front of Salman Khan. <br/><br/>As seen in the latest promo, Salman Khan asks contests to tag them with different names given by the actor. First Devoleena is seen calling Shefali Jariwala - Dishaheen because according to her she had been biased in the post. Reacting to this, Shefali opposes the former’s tag and says she is not lost. Further, Vishal Aditya Singh gives Hindustani Bhau ‘Bol Bachchan’ tag and that was it. Check out the video and witness yourself:<b> (ALSO READ: <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/bigg-boss-13-elimination-rashami-desai-s-rumoured-bf-arhaan-khan-evicted-from-the-bb-house-exclusive/5dcf6cda87fb571eff7e3efe">Bigg Boss 13 Elimination: Rashami Desai's Rumoured Lover Arhaan Khan To Pack His Bags And Leave For Home - EXCLUSIVE</a>)</b></p>
