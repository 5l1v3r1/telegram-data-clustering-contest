      <p>Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara State  has said he decided  to drop 21 permanent secretaries because they failed the  aptitude test conducted by the state government.</p>
      <p>Briefing journalists at the Government House, Gusau, on Friday, Matawalle  also said  the  state government  decided to reduce the number of permanent secretaries because the state had the highest number of PSs in the North-West.</p>
      <p>He said, “All assessments have shown our state has a far greater number of permanent secretaries than any of our sister states in the North-West, and we constituted a restructuring committee to verify their competence.</p>
      <p>“The  committee, therefore, invited all the  permanent secretaries and six others whose appointments were reversed by the past administration and subjected them to a written test and interview to assess them.</p>
      <p>“Based on the outcome of the assessment, only 26 qualified for retention as permanent secretaries.”</p>
      <p>The governor hailed the strategy adopted by the committee in conducting the exercise and consequently accepted to drop 21 of those who failed the test.</p>
      <p>He, however, said  those who were not  retained  would  be considered for appointment as  directors general, managing directors and  executive secretaries.</p>
