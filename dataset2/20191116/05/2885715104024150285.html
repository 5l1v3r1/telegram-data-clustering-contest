      <p>The first season of AltBalaji’s popular web series Broken But Beautiful ended with the lead protagonists, Veer (Vikrant Massey) and Sameera (Harleen Sethi) choosing separate paths to discover themselves. Now, after one year, the makers are releasing the second season of the series and from the look of the trailer, its premise seems to have the potential to hold the interest of audience if given proper treatment.</p>
      <p>The three-minute-long trailer of Broken But Beautiful 2 shows Veer and Sameera’s character moving ahead in life. While Veer, a widower, finally gets into a relationship after being commitment-phobic in the first season, Sameera starts living life to the fullest after grieving over the end of her relationship of five years. But as the two cross paths once again, they feel a strong connection with each other.</p>

      <p>Sharing the trailer, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/ekta-kapoor">Ekta Kapoor</a> wrote on Instagram, “Sometimes ur the emotional Tsunami n sometimes an emotional vacuum The heart is a muscle, which comes with its own muscle memory. The memory of pain. Toh jab sab kuch theek hone ke baad, will Veer and Sameera finally move on or hold on to their pain?”</p>
