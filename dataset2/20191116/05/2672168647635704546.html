      <p>HÀ NỘI ­ – Plans have been proposed to increase tax on tobacco, ban electronic vapes and tighten online advertising of cigarettes.</p>
      <p>The Ministry of Health said it wants to prevent people, particularly youngsters from taking up the habit.</p>
      <p>The proposals were raised at a meeting to review the Law on Tobacco Harms Prevention and Control held by the Ministry of Health (MoH) in Hà Nội yesterday.</p>
      <p>Nguyễn Quang Huy, head of the MoH’s Legal Department, said the price of cigarettes in Việt Nam was far lower than other countries in the region.</p>
      <p>He also said there are serious issues with cross-border smuggling of foreign cigarettes that need to be addressed.</p>
      <p>Trần Thị Trang, vice head of the MoH’s Legal Department, said banning smoking in certain public areas has not been effectively enforced.</p>
      <p>She also said more needs to be done to educate young people about the harm smoking causes.</p>

        <b>E-cigarettes</b>

      <p>Four years ago, a study carried out by the Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS), revealed 1.1 per cent of adults used electronic cigarettes – with many thinking they were harmless.</p>
      <p>Phan Thị Hải, vice director of the Tobacco Harms Prevention and Control Fund, said she believed that figure today is much higher.</p>
      <p>And in recent months, studies in Europe have revealed vapes, or e-cigarettes may cause serious brain damage.</p>
      <p>A survey on e-cigarette consumption is being carried out with results expected next year, but Hải urged the country to ban the use of electronic cigarettes altogether.</p>
      <p>Hải said: “Many tobacco companies persuaded governments that using e-cigarettes was a good method to quit the traditional cigarettes.”</p>
      <p>But, she added, World Health Organisation (WHO) and health experts have concluded there is no proof they help people kick the habit.</p>
      <p>Dr. Phạm Thị Lệ Quyên from Bạch Mai Hospital in Ha Noi said: “Many ingredients in e-cigarettes contain carcinogens such as benzene like traditional tobacco.</p>
      <p>“E-cigarettes are not less harmful than traditional ones. They also pose numerous potential risks that we had not yet evaluated.”</p>
      <p>Việt Nam is one of 15 countries with the most smokers worldwide. The country rank third in the Association of South-East Asian Nations, following Indonesia and the Philippines, said Deputy Minister of Health Nguyễn Trường Sơn.</p>
      <p>According to a global survey on smoking, one in two Vietnamese adults smoke.</p>
      <p>In addition, about 53.3 per cent and 36.8 per cent of non-smokers were exposed to second-hand smoke in their homes and offices.</p>
      <p>Every year, about 40,000 people die from smoking in Việt Nam, said Sơn.</p>
      <p>Five years after the Law on Tobacco Harms Prevention and Control was implemented, progress has been made.</p>
      <p>The number of male smokers has dropped by 2.1 per cent in 2015 as compared to 2010.</p>
      <p>More than 1,500 public offices, 3,700 kindergartens and 7,000 schools nation-wide have enforced smoking ban on campus and indoor areas.</p>
      <p>During five years, there were 195,000 public servants who quit smoking, according to the Việt Nam General Confederation of Labour.</p>
      <p>Cigarette detoxification programmes have been implemented in 24 hospitals in the country, helping more than 800 people quit each year, said Trang. – VNS</p>
