      <p>Thanos may have been snapped out of existence, but the Marvel Cinematic Universe lives on. In fact, it is going to get only bigger from now on. Disney, which owns Marvel Studios, has outed the release dates for five MCU movies, as per The Wrap.</p>
      <p>The identity of those movies is currently under wraps, but we can, of course, speculate. The release dates are October 7, 2022, February 17, 2023, May 5, 2023, July 28, 2023, and November 3, 2023.</p>
      <p>We know movies like the third installment in the Guardians of the Galaxy series is in development. James Gunn will begin work on it once he is done with Warner Bros’ The Suicide Squad. Ant-Man 3 was also confirmed recently.</p>
      <p>With Disney’s acquisition of Fox, we know, Kevin Feige now has X-Men and Fantastic Four characters at his disposal, and it is only a matter of time before we will see Wolverine rubbing shoulders with Thor (perhaps).</p>
      <p>We might see rebooted X-Men and Fantastic Four movies or even the third film in Ryan Reynolds’ highly profitable Deadpool franchise.</p>
      <p>Mahershala Ali was confirmed to be the lead of a Blade reboot movie, so it might also be among those five movies. One other film that may release on those dates is the sequel to Brie Larson’s Captain Marvel.</p>
      <p>MCU movies like Black Widow, The Eternals, Doctor Strange In the Multiverse of Madness, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, Black Panther 2 and <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/hollywood/taika-waititi-confirms-chris-hemsworth-thor-love-and-thunder-5999444/">Thor: Love and Thunder</a> already have release dates.</p>
