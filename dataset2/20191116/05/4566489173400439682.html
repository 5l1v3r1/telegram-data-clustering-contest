      <h1>Australian man survives croc attack by gouging its eye</h1>

      <p>An Australian wildlife ranger has recounted his terrifying escape from the clutches of a "particularly cunning" crocodile, after wrestling with the reptile and sticking a finger in its eye.</p>
      <p>Craig Dickmann, who made a split-second decision to go fishing last Sunday in a remote part of Northern Australia known as "croc country" last Sunday, said a 2.8-metre (nine-foot) crocodile came up from behind him as he was leaving the beach.</p>
      <p>"As I've turned to go, the first thing I see is its head just come at me," he told reporters on Friday from his hospital bed in the town of Cairns in Queensland state.</p>
      <p>Dickmann said the animal latched on to his thigh.</p>
      <p>"That noise will haunt me forever I think, the sound of the snap of its jaws," he said.</p>
      <p>The 54-year-old said he wrestled with the croc on the remote beach as it tried to drag him into the water.</p>
      <p>Dickmann stuck his thumb into its eye, saying it was the only "soft spot" he found on the "bullet-proof" animal.</p>
      <p>"Their eyes retract a fair way and when you go down far enough you can feel bone so I pushed as far as I possibly could and then it let go at that point," Dickmann said.</p>
      <p>After a few minutes, he said he managed to get on top of the croc and pin its jaws shut.</p>
      <p>"And then, I think both the croc and I had a moment where we're going, 'well, what do we do now?'"</p>
      <p>Dickmann said he then pushed the croc away from him and it slid back into the water.</p>
      <p>The ranger had skin ripped from his hands and legs in the ordeal and drove more than 45 minutes back to his home before calling emergency services.</p>
      <p>It was then another hour in the car to meet the Royal Flying Doctors Service who flew him to Cairns Hospital, where he is recovering from the ordeal.</p>
      <p>"This croc was particularly cunning and particularly devious, " he said.</p>
      <p>Queensland's department of environment this week euthanized the animal.</p>
      <p>"The area is known croc country and people in the area are reminded to always be crocwise,‚Äù the department said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Saltwater crocodiles, which can grow up to seven metres long and weigh more than a tonne, are common in the vast continent's tropical north.</p>
      <p>Their numbers have exploded since they were declared a protected species in the 1970s, with attacks on humans rare.</p>
      <p>According to the state government, the last non-fatal attack was in January 2018 in the Torres Strait while the last death was in October 2017 in Port Douglas.</p>
