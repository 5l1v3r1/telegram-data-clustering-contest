      <p>Two people were wounded when a gunman opened fire on a crowd at a high school football game in southern New Jersey on Friday evening, police said.</p>
      <p>The shooter fired into a crowd of spectators who were sitting in the bleachers of Pleasantville High School at about 8:30 p.m., authorities said.</p>
      <p>Pleasantville, which is about seven miles from Atlantic City, was facing Camden High School in a playoff football game when the shots rang out.</p>
      <p>A man and a boy were seriously injured in the shooting; the boy was airlifted to a hospital in Philadelphia to be treated, authorities said.</p>
      <p>The shooting happened on the Pleasantville bleachers, authorities said.</p>
      <p>Videos posted to social media show fans and players sprinting to safety after the shots rang out.</p>
      <p>Atlantic County Prosecutor Damon Tyner said at a press conference after the shooting that there are a number of witnesses to the melee.</p>
      <p>“This was the most well-attended high school football game for this school in years, so there are many witnesses to the incident that are currently being interviewed,” he said, <a href="https://www.nj.com/news/2019/11/shots-fired-at-nj-high-school-football-game-witness-says.html">according to NJ.com</a>.</p>
      <p>“This is a tragic situation, to say the least, on the heels of what just happened in Santa Clarita, California. It has hit home here in Pleasantville New Jersey and it is very disturbing to say the least,” he added.</p>
