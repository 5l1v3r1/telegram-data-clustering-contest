      <p>Hello, and welcome back to the drama that is Taylor Swift versus her old record label Big Machine Records. ICYMI, earlier this week <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a29807801/taylor-swift-scooter-braun-scott-borchetta-tyrannical-control-amas-netflix-doc/">Taylor released a lengthy statement on Tumblr slamming Scooter Braun and Big Machine Records CEO Scott Borchetta</a> for allegedly preventing her from performing her old songs during a medley at the 2019 AMAs and not allowing her to include her old music in an upcoming Netflix documentary.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Since then, Big Machine released a statement saying,‚ÄúTaylor, the narrative you have created does not exist,‚Äù and Taylor's rep fired back with another statement detailing Taylor's claims and alleging that Big Machine owes Tay $7.9 million in unpaid royalties. Basically, it's a big ol' mess.</p>
      <p>Now celebs are taking sides, and while <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a29811564/selena-gomez-taylor-swift-scooter-braun-amas-netflix-doc/">Selena Gomez came out in support of Taylor</a> (she wrote that Taylor's claims make her "sick and extremely angry"), Justin Bieber is siding with Big Machine and his manager Scooter Braun. Yesterday, Justin shared a screen shot of a <i>TMZ </i>article with the headline "Taylor Swift Free to Play All Her Hits During AMAs...Big Machine Can't Stop Her" in his Instagram stories. The article includes a statement from a Big Machine official who says,"we have no legal right to stop this and have never tried. [Taylor] and her team both know this"...so it's safe to say Justin's not team Taylor on this one!</p>
