      <p>CAIRNS, Australia: An Australian wildlife ranger has recounted his terrifying escape from the clutches of a “particularly cunning” crocodile, after wrestling with the reptile and sticking a finger in its eye.<br/>Craig Dickmann, who made a split-second decision to go fishing last Sunday in a remote part of Northern Australia known as “croc country” last Sunday, said a 2.8-meter (nine-foot) crocodile came up from behind him as he was leaving the beach.<br/>“As I’ve turned to go, the first thing I see is its head just come at me,” he told reporters on Friday from his hospital bed in the town of Cairns in Queensland state.<br/>Dickmann said the animal latched on to his thigh.<br/>“That noise will haunt me forever I think, the sound of the snap of its jaws,” he said.<br/>The 54-year-old said he wrestled with the croc on the remote beach as it tried to drag him into the water.<br/>Dickmann stuck his thumb into its eye, saying it was the only “soft spot” he found on the “bullet-proof” animal.<br/>“Their eyes retract a fair way and when you go down far enough you can feel bone so I pushed as far as I possibly could and then it let go at that point,” Dickmann said.<br/>After a few minutes, he said he managed to get on top of the croc and pin its jaws shut.<br/>“And then, I think both the croc and I had a moment where we’re going, ‘well, what do we do now?’”<br/>Dickmann said he then pushed the croc away from him and it slid back into the water.<br/>The ranger had skin ripped from his hands and legs in the ordeal and drove more than 45 minutes back to his home before calling emergency services.<br/>It was then another hour in the car to meet the Royal Flying Doctors Service who flew him to Cairns Hospital, where he is recovering from the ordeal.<br/>“This croc was particularly cunning and particularly devious,” he said.<br/>Queensland’s department of environment this week euthanized the animal.<br/>“The area is known croc country and people in the area are reminded to always be crocwise,” the department said in a statement.<br/>Saltwater crocodiles, which can grow up to seven meters long and weigh more than a ton, are common in the vast continent’s tropical north.<br/>Their numbers have exploded since they were declared a protected species in the 1970s, with attacks on humans rare.<br/>According to the state government, the last non-fatal attack was in January 2018 in the Torres Strait while the last death was in October 2017 in Port Douglas.</p>
