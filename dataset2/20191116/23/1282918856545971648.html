      <p>An announcement of a new film or a new poster/look is usually on the cards when a celebrity celebrates his/her birthday. More of a norm seen for stars down South, of late, even Bollywood is following this trend, making fans anticipate something special on their favourite stars’ special day. As Aditya Roy Kapur celebrated his 34th birthday, the first glimpse of his movie <i>Malang </i>was unveiled. The actor and co-star Disha Patani looked completely in love in the still, promising an interesting love story. </p>

      <p>Trade analyst Taran Adarsh took to Twitter to share the glimpse. In the still, Aditya and Disha are seen enjoying themselves and dancing at what seemed like a beach party. Flaunting his six-pack abs, and wearing sunglasses, headband, and loose pants, Aditya is seen pointing to the sky with Disha, dressed in a white sleeveless top and blue floral skirt, in his arm.</p>

      <p>The still could be from a song, and fans of both Aditya and Disha would be eager to know more about their love story. More so, because it is the first time the pair is working together. The fact that the film has been directed by Mohit Suri, known for his romantic films, also raises the expectations for the movie. It goes without saying that Aditya-Mohit would be keen to recreate the blockbuster success of <i>Aashiqui 2</i>. Actor Shaad Randhawa, who played Aditya Roy Kapur’s buddy in his biggest hit <i>Aashiqui 2,</i> also wished his former co-star by sharing the still. He wrote, “Happy birthday Adi baba ... Rahe hamesha tu #MALANG #MALANG #MALANG ... Love you brother!” </p>

      <p>Aditya was last seen in <i>Kalank</i>. The movie had also starred Varun Dhawan, Alia Bhatt, Sonakshi Sinha, Sanjay Dutt and Madhuri Dixit Nene in lead roles. The movie, however, did not live up to the expectations at the box office. The actor, meanwhile, had another film in his kitty, Anurag Basu’s multi-starrer drama. </p>
