      <h1>Texas Fans Aren’t Happy With Tom Herman vs. Iowa State Tonight</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T23:32:45+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 23:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>Texas wasn’t expected to beat Iowa State tonight. Jack Trice Stadium is a tough place to play, and Tom Herman’s Longhorns haven’t exactly separated themselves from the Big 12 pack so far this year.</p>
      <p>ISU entered the game as a <a href="https://thespun.com/big-12/texas-longhorns/texas-at-iowa-state-game-time-spread-channel-announcers">seven-point favorite</a>. Through three quarters, the Cyclones led 20-7, though Texas just <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/boxscore?gameId=401112093">cut it to 20-14</a> to start the final frame.</p>
      <p>With star quarterback Sam Ehlinger back, off of last year’s impressive season and Sugar Bowl win over Georgia, expectations were high for UT. Some probably underestimated what some of the other losses on the roster would mean.</p>
      <p>Still, even with how good Matt Campbell has been in Ames, Texas fans expect to beat Iowa State every year.</p>
      <p>Today, they’re not too happy with how Tom Herman’s team has looked:</p>

      <p>This season is far from a disaster for Texas… the team is ranked 19th, and 6-3 on the year. Part of the issue was probably inflated expectations based on a bowl game, which is a pretty common occurrence.</p>
      <p>You can understand the frustrations though, especially with how good the Longhorns can look in spurts.</p>
      <p>If Texas wants a chance for a rematch against Oklahoma in the Big 12 title game, it probably needs to find a way to pull this out. Outside of some vocal fans, Tom Herman probably doesn’t have any real job pressure, though at some point he will need to take the leap that it looked like the Longhorns were nearing last fall.</p>
