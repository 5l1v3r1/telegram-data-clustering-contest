      <p>Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick had many messages to get out when he hit the field on Saturday, but first he had to show off the skill he knew he still possessed and perfectly displayed in front of NFL scouts.</p>
      <p>Before he left the high school, Kaepernick had a strong message for the scouts to tell their team owners.</p>

      <p>The owners weren’t the only ones he had a message for on this day as he called out Commissioner Roger Goodell as well.</p>
      <blockquote>“We’re waiting for the owners and Commissioner Goodell to stop running from the truth.”</blockquote>

      <p>Just as the workout started, the NFL released a statement in response to Kaepernick opting to do his own workout instead of the NFL-organized one. <i>“We are disappointed that Colin did not appear for his workout. He informed us of that decision at 2:30 p.m. today along with the public,”</i> the statement reads.</p>
      <blockquote>“Today’s session was designed to give Colin what he has consistently said he wants-an opportunity to show his football readiness and desire to return to the NFL,” the statement continues, before explaining 25 clubs were present for the workout. “Colin’s decision has no effect on his status in the League. He remains an unrestricted free agent eligible to sign with any club.”</blockquote>
