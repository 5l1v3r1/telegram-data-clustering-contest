      <p> </p>
      <p>Kidnapping, that’s the latest in town</p>
      <p>I heard it happened yesterday</p>
      <p>when they stormed the home of</p>
      <p>Childhood friend, Ikenna</p>
      <p>Scaling the huge fence, whisking</p>
      <p>him away.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>They thundered at his family to</p>
      <p>provide him or be all drowned</p>
      <p>Where’s he, the business tycoon?</p>
      <p>they shouted; from the toilet</p>
      <p>he was taken away and in fear</p>
      <p>we awaited his return.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Today it is my turn. Yes, my turn</p>
      <p>They took me on my way to</p>
      <p>work this morning.</p>
      <p>They say I must pay N200 million naira</p>
      <p>as ransom</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>They said I have stockpiled</p>
      <p>too much wealth, waiting to</p>
      <p>strike; unleashing mayhem on them</p>
      <p>They accuse me of being a</p>
      <p>mercenary and must be dealt with.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>‘You bloody government contractor!</p>
      <p>They tell me to disclose</p>
      <p>my account number or lose</p>
      <p>a finger; may be my manhood.</p>
      <p>They say I know too much</p>
      <p>to be left to my devices.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>They abuse me and spit on my</p>
      <p>face, saying – brave little man</p>
      <p>free theyself.</p>
      <p>But I am harangued.</p>
      <p>I am in a dungeon, being fed</p>
      <p>with akamu and akara.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>I am waiting for my freedom.</p>
      <p>Fear grips me; fear of the unknown</p>
      <p>In the kidnappers’ den – it is</p>
      <p>a dungeon – dangerous…</p>
      <p>I’ve been kidnapped like many,</p>
      <p>big and small before me and still more to come.</p>
