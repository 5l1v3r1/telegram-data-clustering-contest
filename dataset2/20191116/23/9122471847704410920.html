      <h1>Brian Herrien, Jake Fromm Said A Prayer For The Injured Photographer During Halftime</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T23:15:24+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 23:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matt-admin" target="_blank">Matt Lombardi</a></address>
      <p>Just before halftime of the Auburn-Georgia game, we had a scary situation at Jordan-Hare Stadium. Bulldogs running back Brian Herrien, after a short pass, we pushed out of bounds into a Georgia student photographer. She was knocked unconscious.</p>
      <p>She came to a few minutes later, but needed to be carted off the field and taken by ambulance to the hospital. It looked like she was able to speak when leaving the stadium.</p>
      <p>The woman has since been identified as Georgia student Chamberlain Smith. CBS Sports sideline reporter Jamie Erdahl provided an update on her situation.</p>
      <p>Erdahl also noted that at halftime, Herrien and teammate Jake Fromm said a prayer in the locker room for Smith’s recovery.</p>

      <p>We’ll keep you updated on Smith’s status. Hopefully she didn’t suffer any kind of serious injury.</p>
      <p>Georgia, near the end of the third quarter, still holds a 14-0 lead. The Bulldogs can keep their hopes of a College Football Playoff berth with a win.</p>
