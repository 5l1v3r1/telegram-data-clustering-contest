        <b>Police have recovered the body of a young journalist at his home in Dhaka’s Banasree.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Monsur Ali, 33, was a sub-editor of online newspaper Bangla Tribune.</p>
      <p>Police had to break the door of his room as it was locked from inside around 8:30pm on Saturday, Khilgaon Police Station OC Moshiur Rahman said.</p>
      <p>The other tenant of the flat on the fifth floor of the building in the neighbourhood is Monojit Mitra, a journalist working at Sarabangla.net.</p>
      <p>Both Monsur and Monojit are unmarried and lived in two separate rooms of the flat, according to Bangla Tribune Senior Reporter Nuruzzaman Labu.</p>
      <p>Monsur returned home from office on Friday midnight while Monojit spent the night in a friend’s home, Labu told bdnews24.com.</p>
      <p>Monojit returned to the flat on Saturday evening and called the landlord when he got no response after knocking the door of Monsur’s room, Labu said.</p>
      <p>Later, Monsur’s colleagues and police were called in, he added.</p>
      <p>OC Moshiur said police initially suspected Monsir died of cardiac arrest.</p>
      <p>“But the actual reason of death can be confirmed only after post-mortem examination,” he added.</p>
      <p>Monsur hailed from Kotalpara in Sylhet’s Fenchuganj.</p>
      <p>Bangla Tribune said in a report that its Publisher Kazi Anis Ahmed, and Editor Zulfiqer Russell expressed deep sorrow over the death of Monsur.</p>
