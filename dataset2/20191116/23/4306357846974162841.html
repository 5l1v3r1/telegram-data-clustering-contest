      <h3>Didier Drogba has taken to social media to pay tribute to Tammy Abraham after the Chelsea FC striker scored his first goal for England last week.</h3>
      <p>The 22-year-old has made a brilliant start to the new season with Chelsea FC and has been a regular fixture in the first team under Frank Lampard.</p>
      <p>Abraham has scored an impressive 10 goals and made two assists in the Premier League for Lampard’s men this season to help the Blues up into third place in the table.</p>
      <p>The young striker’s fine form has earned him a spot in Gareth Southgate’s England side and the forward came off the bench to score in the Three Lions’ 7-0 thrashing of Montenegro at Wembley on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>Chelsea FC <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B43I-buJuX7/">posted about</a> Abraham’s England goal after the game on the club’s official Instagram account, and Blues legend Drogba left a comment under the photo.</p>
      <p>Drogba wrote in the comment: “Waaw!!!! Tammy Abraham, so proud of you!!! Congrats son.”</p>
      <p>Chelsea FC fans will be hoping to see Abraham continue his fine form for the Blues when they take on Manchester City at The Etihad on Saturday evening.</p>
      <p>The Blues are aiming to maintain their spot in the top four this season and they currently find themselves eight points behind leaders Liverpool FC.</p>
