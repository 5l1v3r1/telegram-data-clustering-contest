      <h1>Furious St. John’s rally falls just short in loss to Vermont</h1>

      <p>St. John’s staged a furious rally, shaking off a poor second half, waking up a large yet disappointed crowd. It didn’t matter. Anthony Lamb was the best player on the floor all afternoon and he had the final answer, a pull-up jumper from the left wing to hand Mike Anderson his first loss as the Johnnies’ coach.</p>
      <p>His dagger with 2.4 seconds left was the difference in a furious and wild ending that sent Vermont to a 70-68 victory Saturday at Carnesecca Arena in Queens. On the ensuing inbounds play, LJ Figueroa stepped out of bounds trying to force overtime.</p>
      <p>Down as many as 10 points, St. John’s came storming back, getting even on Rasheem Dunn’s left-wing 3-pointer with 19.3 seconds to go in his Red Storm debut.</p>
      <p>St. John’s seemed to be in good position at halftime, ahead by five. Its pressure led to nine Vermont turnovers. But the Catamounts adjusted as you would expect an experienced team would. They took care of the ball, rode Lamb’s 23 points and went to a matchup zone that forced St. John’s to the perimeter. When the Johnnies forced the ball out of Lamb’s hands, his teammates made them pay.</p>
      <p>Down nine with 4:05 to go, St. John’s came storming back. After missing two free throws on the previous possession, Mustapha Heron got his own rebound and completed a 3-point play. Stef Smith missed the front end of a one-and-one and Heron hit a 3-pointer to cut the deficit to a point.</p>
      <p>But in the end, St. John’s couldn’t overcome its own offensive deficiencies. Not shooting 5-of-19 from 3-point range, not missing 12 free throws and not its 16 mostly unforced turnovers.</p>
      <p>The second half began like the first half — St. John’s missing its first five shots from the field and committing three turnovers as Vermont quickly got within one before the first media timeout. Soon, the Catamounts were ahead, riding Lamb’s hot shooting in keying a 17-5 run to a seven-point edge. He scored 13 points in the first eight minutes of the second half, hammering St. John’s in the paint and from the perimeter.</p>
      <p>St. John’s stabilized the game, getting within a point on several occasions, but couldn’t get over the hump. Vermont cutting through the press and pressure defense like a knife through butter, knocking down open shots and making the Johnnies pay for gambling.</p>
      <p>St. John’s started poorly offensively, making just four of its first 23 shots, but stayed within range thanks to its pressure defense. The Johnnies awoke late in the opening half, reeling off 16 of the final 21 points and the last 11. Dunn closed the half with a pull-up jumper from the free-throw line. But it was Marcellus Earlington who turned the opening 20 minutes around with his hustle and strength in the lane.</p>
      <p>He had six points, five rebounds and three steals, and set up Josh Roberts for a thunderous slam that would pull the Red Storm even at 25. Earlington followed with the next three points, before Dunn’s jumper. Earlington, along with freshman Julian Champagnie, helped keep Lamb in check early, limiting the Vermont star to four points on 2-of-9 shooting.</p>
      <p>St. John’s was the more aggressive team, attempting 10 more free throws and notching 10 second chance points, aided by five Roberts offensive rebounds.</p>
