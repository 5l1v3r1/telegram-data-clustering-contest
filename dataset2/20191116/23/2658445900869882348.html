      </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>What is it like to have a theme that finally appealed to Nigeria Literature prize committee this time around?</p>
      <p>Oh, it is exciting; I am elated.  Winning the prize was something that was long in coming.  I was elated; I was excited like I said before.  My work has been validated to a large extent.  So winning was not enough, but a lot of people were happy that I won it.  It tells me that there are people out there waiting for me; people out there who love my works, who believe in what I do.  They also believe that I deserve more than what I am getting.  It was indeed a combination of several years of writing, even though I have won other awards within that period.  But for the Nigerian prize for literature which is the much sought-after prize I think it is a nice shinning cap for me.</p>
      <p>Looking at the books that made the long and the short lists, which themes do you think were in the forefront?</p>
      <p>I think an award first and foremost is subjective, yes most times.  So there are criteria that have to be met, which are dear to judges.  But also there are what do they want, what appeals to them most?  I have not been able to seriously pinpoint any theme that appealed to them most.  To be honest with you, I have not been able to do so.  But at least all the works that made the long or shortlists had appealed to the judges in one way or the other.  They first of all considered the quality of the works and every other theme or issue was secondary.  May be this time around all the pieces fell in place and I was able to emerge the winner.  May be it seems the book was able also to surmount all the challenges.  I have been able to speak to some of the people who have won it before.  I have spoken with some people who are connected with the prize.  Some have said that of course that sometimes, it could be the topic you are writing on, or the issues you’ve raised that has it going for you.  So, they might be that the topic is extant or that the topic that won is more topical and relevant at that material time.  That may then catch the attention of the judges.  But you just have to face your writing.  Write on any theme or topic that appeals to you; do it to the best of your ability and the rest will fall in place.  Then with that, luck, chance, providence will be your lot.</p>
      <p>Now, if you didn’t win this, what will be your next move?</p>
      <p>Oh, I would have kept on writing, yes, I will.  Of course the first thing is that I am a writer, an artist.  I am a writer first and foremost.  It is not like I am writing to deliberately win an award.  No.  I write because I have stories to tell; I have ideas to pass across.  That is the most important aspect.  In the first place, I have a message to share.  And the Nigerian prize for literature is a big platform you can never deny is there to promote and encourage our literature.  It beams some sort of limelight on your work.  When I write and I have something to say, I usually submit it; I send it across to the right place.  So, if it can make the long list, it helps to know that a book exists.  In Nigeria hundreds of books come out every year and your book can then be displayed among the best.  It is an encouraging development.  So that is what the prize does for me and it is also good and that is why I submit my works every time my work met the requirements.  So if I did not win this year, I will still keep on submitting.  Even now that I won, I’ll keep writing; I’ll keep submitting.  That is the attitude of Margareth Artwood who just won the Booker prize for the second time in England.  She never gave up and see how she got it again.  So, there is always something to say; something new to write about in the society.  So, that’s that; I will keep on writing.</p>
      <p>Now, it seems you have torn the history of Benin Kingdom, Benin Empire to pieces in your works.  Why Benin basically?</p>
      <p>May be first and foremost I was born and bred in Lagos, which makes the absence drive me home most times.  I do not speak the language, I mean the Bini Language.  So, I have this kind of romantic relations with my culture, my people, the place I come from.  Then I try to be as Bini as I can.  And in trying to be as Bini or as Edo as I can, I try also to explore the culture, its nuances, its history and the more I do that the more I discover and see holes or gaps that need to be filled or re-ordered.  These issues need to be talked about.  So that is basically why I fall back on the history of the Edo or Benin people.  This forms most of the information contained in my works.</p>
      <p>You have written plays, now children’s literature, when do we expect prose fiction from you?</p>
      <p>Ah, I am actually writing something on fiction.  One thing about me is that I can actually write four books at the same time.  So I have all these at different stages of completion.  When I have writer’s bloc I jump to the other one.  Therefore, there is something in the offing on prose fiction and it will soon be ready.  It will be coming out, hopefully very soon and it will also be exploring Bini culture and history.  It is on the spirit world, in the cosmos.  You know every time people say the Binis have plenty of witchcrafts and all sorts.  When you hear about all you get to know is juju or witchcrafts.  So this story is on all this.  This explores that spiritual aspects of the Binis, why is it that people always associate the people with all these?  So, if you say the Bini person is a witch, where does it come from?  It will soon come out.</p>
      <p>Have you at any point been confronted by your people that you misrepresented the history or so?</p>
      <p>What I think first and foremost is that my works dwell on the people.  For instance my work, Oduduwa, the king of the Edo, when people see the title they always go on the defensive.  How can you write that?  Who told you it is so?  That Oduduwa is the King of the Edos?  But I’d say to them, go and read and watch the play first, then you can make your deductions.  Some would say oh brother thank you.  We’ve been expecting someone to say this and you’ve said it.  This approaches history from a different point of view, different from what we’ve been told.  Oh this is good; this is refreshing indeed so when they explore your work, they are more open to the views you have expressed, you’ve posited.  Yes, I have got kudos, I have got people who have holes to pick about the works.  Mostly people have to see the other side of the Yoruba end of the history of the people.  However, in the end, they have come to see its perspective in my works.  Once they have read it, they will then see and appreciate the scholarly and academic angle to the work.  After that, they will become fans of the book.  But before then, they will be pitching their tent, trying to defend what they see as their history.</p>
      <p>Here history goes well for you, for it is known there was first Bini Kingdom before the arrival of Oranmiyan from Ile-Ife…?</p>
      <p>Yes, totally.  That is what the Oduduwa play does, the Igodomi Igodo.  The Bini Kingdom existed before the Bini Kingdom as we know it today.  The Ogisos were the ones in charge of the first kingdom.  They were the rulers before the arrival of Oranmiyan.  Even the title itself means those who came from the sky to rule the earth.  Oba Oranmiyan was the one that brought the Obaship from Ile-Ife and it stuck with the people ever since.  He did not found Benin.  What he did was to bring the people together and unit the different communities.  He had plenty of spiritual powers which the Binis benefited from.  He also brought vast expertise on empire building to bear on the people.  They would tell you that Oduduwa journeyed from the East, from Mecca to found Ile-Ife.  But when you asked them where or what is the East, they won’t be able to proffer an answer.</p>
      <p>But then there was already Benin in existence with the Igodomi Igodo.  That is the Igodomi Igodo Kingdom.  So, that tells you that this kingdom was there then.  That is what my play tries to do, tries to examine all these pros and cons of historical and cultural facts.  These are also people who came down to Earth from the sky to rule.  How do you now discuss that about the people; about the old Benin history?  Okay, they say Oduduwa came down from the sky, what if he had met them and they said who are you and he said I am Prince so and so, is that not also coming from the sky?  So, what is an Ogiso?</p>
      <p>They would say we are the ones that also came down from the sky to rule.  May be that’s where the story lies.  So that’s what my play does, to explore those ends too.  It helps too to look at the culture and history of the people from a research point of view.  That’s why I say that when people read it, they are impressed with the scholarly bent to it and this is so exhilarating and remarkable.  The depth of research helps to situate the story.  No, I am not calling anybody a liar or the like.  These are facts of history which are out there in time and space.  I am only saying what if you think of this because of this?…</p>
      <p>In summation what is Boom Boom?</p>
      <p>The story explores sickle cell anaemia.  The story centres on a nine year old girl with sickle cell.  The same sickness had taken their mum’s life and here was this girl in the same situation.  So, it is a topical story dealing with a very serious issue in the society.  It is a serious theme, but told from the eye of a child.  Therefore Boom Boom is the central character.  It is a nickname of the character.  Her real name is Eghosa.  But in the book she assumes her nickname and the name really appeals to children.  So that’s wha t it is in a nutchshell.  Then, it is bigger than that because it explores a theme that has bothered the society for a long time.  Now, it has come out in a novel form.  It is an exploration of diseases; it is an exploration of hope, of an issue and what needs to be done to curtail it.  It is of courage, brotherhood, of a sense of communal life style.  May be it found resonance with the judges – the theme and how it is handled, I mean.  The people who have read it, I hope it keeps making the giant strides it is meant to make.</p>
