      <p>On March 31, a MiG-27 aircraft of the Indian Air Force (IAF) crashed near Jodhpur in Rajasthan.</p>
      <p>The pilot of the MiG-27 aircraft ejected safely and the aircraft was on a routine mission when it crashed. According to the publication, officials had cited "engine problems" as the reason for the crash of the "MiG-27 UPG aircraft which got airborne from Utarlai Air Force base".</p>
      <p>On March 8, the IAF lost a MiG-21 after it crashed while on routine patrol in Rajasthan because of a "bird hit after take off".</p>
      <p>Pakistan had downed two Indian aircraft on Feb 27, at least one of which was a MiG-21 Bison. The loss had triggered Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to say the results of the dogfight would have been different if India had inducted Rafale fighter jets into its air force — a comment seen as a veiled swipe at the MiG-21.</p>
      <p>An Indian pilot, Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, was arrested by troops and later released by the government as a gesture of peace intended to defuse soaring tensions with New Delhi.</p>
      <p>Their respective air forces and armies of the both countries remain operationally deployed.</p>
      <p>More details are awaited.</p>
