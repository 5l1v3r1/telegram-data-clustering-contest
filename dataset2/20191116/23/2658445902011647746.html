      <p>I was recently in Hyderabad, India, to attend a conference. Although the conference had nothing to do with literature, there is no way I get to a place and not try to feel the pulse of its literature. This is because I have that strong connection and belief that literature is life and that it shows the way and tells you the direction and rhythm of a people and what they are.</p>
      <p>It was a packed conference that almost left one with no time to do any other thing. But literature would always have its way no matter how tight the schedule is. In a piece (A Passage to India, Nov. 3), I had written about the enviable literary heritage of India and how its writers have done very well on the world stage.</p>
      <p>English is the official language of the country along with other indigenous languages which have not been neglected; they are being developed because there are newspapers that publish in those languages. The literacy level is high and you can see that among the people. But this is not to say that they are all literate; at times you meet some people and you’re astonished that they speak not a single word of English!</p>
      <p>This brings me to the fact that India has gone a long way not only in medical tourism but one can safely say in all facets. This is not to say there is no poverty there. Of course you can see poverty is still there but the people are living and eking out their living the best way they can. Reading and printing materials are cheap thus making books and newspapers to be cheap and available to all. For instance, The Times of India, the country’s third largest circulating newspaper and second largest in the world, sells for only four India Rupees, which is about N20! It is the oldest English circulating newspaper in the country and has been owned and run by different families and interests since it was established in 1838. It was once called “the leading newspaper in India” by Lord Curzon, the Viceroy of India.</p>
      <p>Why is the paper still in existence and selling that cheap? Well, the answer is not far-fetched. The country has been able to run its affairs very well and they don’t have leaders and politicians who are bent on eating the country to its marrow. They have a viable system that ensures that newsprints and other materials that go into production of newspapers and anything printing are sourced locally.</p>
      <p>Consequently, newspapers and other reading materials are affordable. I have found out that perhaps apart from the United States of America, the other country to shop for books at affordable prices is India. Visits to bookshops show that one can have truck full of books without breaking the bank. An average novel that you buy here at about N2500 would cost you less than a thousand naira and this is well published and stitched books, not the dull and haphazard publications we do here.</p>
      <p>Now why are we descending down the ladder of human development? I remember that when a few people heard before my departure that I was travelling to India, the question that they kept asking me was if I was going for medical tourism. I wonder why we are going this way. Years ago, going to India for anything was scoffed at but the tide has turned full circle. When will Nigeria have its own turn of event and will this be possible with the current crop of leadership we have in our country?</p>
      <p>We must begin to think outside the box and work out how we are going to retrieve our country from the jaws of this blood sucking jackals who masquerade as politicians.</p>
