      <h1>Lapid to Netanyahu: Part from Litzman and Smotrich</h1>
      <h2>Smotrich: 'Yair Lapid prefers Tibi over Litzman and Cassif over Smotrich - a gov't with supporters of terrorism and opponents of Zionism.'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T23:47:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 23:47</time> by <a rel="author">Hezki Baruch</a></address>
      <p>Following Prime Minister Binyamin <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/271758">Netanyahu's warning of Blue and White's intention</a> of forming a minority government with the support of the Arab Joint List, Blue and White leader MK Yair Lapid called on Netanyahu to dismantle <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/269102">the right-wing bloc</a> and conduct coalition negotiations on behalf of the Likud only.</p>
      <p>"Bibi (Netanyahu - ed.), all you have to do is tell [Deputy Health Minister Yaakov] Litzman (UTJ) and [Transportation Minister Bezalel] Smotrich (Jewish Home) that the welfare of Israel comes first, part from them nicely and negotiate directly with Blue and White," Lapid wrote on Twitter.</p>
      <p>"As long as you're not willing to do this, all your hysteria is the hypocrisy of a man who is afraid of losing his position."</p>
      <p>Smotrich responded: "So Yair Lapid prefers Ahmed Tibi over Litzman and Ofer Cassif over Smotrich. A government with supporters of terrorism and opponents of Zionism over a government with its brothers in the Religious Zionist and haredi public. Tell me who your friends are and it tells me you who you are."</p>
      <p>Tibi and Cassif are members of the Joint Arab List, a party whose members have <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/241848">called IDF soldiers "murderers,"</a> threatened <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/222777">to try Israel at the International Criminal Court</a>, and <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/270332">criticized IDF soldiers </a>for defending themselves and Israeli civilians from violent Gaza rioters.</p>
