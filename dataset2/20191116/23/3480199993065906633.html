      <p>Matthias Ginter was delighted to register his first international goal as Germany booked their place at Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>The Borussia Monchengladbach centre-back opened the scoring in the 41st minute with an exquisite backheeled flick from Serge Gnabry’s low cross on his home ground.</p>
      <p>Leon Goretzka doubled Germany’s advantage before a brace from Toni Kroos wrapped up a routine 4-0 victory against Belarus to move top of Group C.</p>

      <p>Northern Ireland’s failure to win at home against Holland meant the three points were enough for Joachim Low’s side to progress to next summer’s tournament, alongside their Dutch counterparts.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the German Football Association’s official website, Ginter said: “Our main aim was to qualify for the Euros. We’re pleased to be part of such a big tournament.</p>
      <p>“I’m really happy about my first goal. It’s great that I got it here in Monchengladbach too. They often left us a lot of space.”</p>

      <p>Germany boss Low added: “I congratulated the players on securing qualification – that was our main goal. The team played really well tonight.</p>
      <p>“They combined well with one another. We were slightly sloppy after our third goal and have to be more clinical.”</p>
      <p>Belarus burst into life when trailing 3-0 in Monchengladbach, with Yuri Kovalev heading wide before the visitors were awarded a 75th-minute penalty for a foul by Robin Koch.</p>
      <p>However, captain Manuel Neuer preserved his clean sheet by guessing correctly to produce a brilliant save from Igor Stasevich’s spot-kick.</p>

      <p>Kroos, who scored his 16th and 17th international goal, and fellow goalscorer Goretzka both agreed that there is room for further improvement ahead of Germany’s 13th successive European Championship appearance.</p>
      <p>“It’s always difficult against teams like that until you make it 1-0. We didn’t struggle too much, but we weren’t at our best early on,” Real Madrid midfielder Kroos said.</p>
      <p>“We have a lot of quality players, although sometimes you can tell we are lacking a bit of experience as a side. We are heading in the right direction.</p>

      <p>“We’ll have to see where we are at just before the tournament begins. Both friendlies in March will be important in telling us that too.”</p>
      <p>Goretzka added: “We are a young group with little time left to play before the tournament. We take every opportunity to take the next development step.</p>
      <p>“We have to evolve because we are far from where we want to go.”</p>
