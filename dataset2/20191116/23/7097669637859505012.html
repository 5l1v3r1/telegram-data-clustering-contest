      <p>(Reuters) - Three young boys and two adults were fatally shot and another boy was wounded in a domestic dispute that escalated into a shooting on Saturday in southeastern San Diego, police said.</p>
      <p>Police responded to a home in the Paradise Hills neighborhood where they found a 3-year-old boy along with mother and father dead inside early Saturday morning. Three other boys, ages 5, 9 and 11, were taken to a hospital where two of them died, San Diego Police Chief David Nisleit said during a news conference.</p>
      <p>"When the officers arrived on the scene, they were able to look into one of the windows and see a small child inside covered in blood," San Diego Police Lieutenant Matt Dobbs said.</p>
      <p>The third boy who was taken to the hospital underwent emergency surgery, Dobbs said.</p>
      <p>After the mother obtained a restraining order against the father on Friday, the couple got in an argument on Saturday morning. After shooting the family, the father turned his handgun on himself, Dobbs said.</p>
      <p>Police did not release the names of the victims.</p>
