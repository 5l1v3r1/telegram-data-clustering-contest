      <p>Official results from local government areas in Kogi State have started trickling in.</p>
      <p>After the announcement of the governorship election results at polling units, collations were done in wards before those of local governments.</p>

      <p>The final announcement of results of each local government will be announced at the INEC collation centre in the local government.</p>
      <p>PREMIUM TIMES has provided live updates of the election which has witnessed late arrival of electoral materials, violence and intimidation of voters. The election was, however, also peaceful and efficient in many other areas.</p>

      <p>However, the governorship contest is expected to be between the incumbent Yahaya Bello (APC) and Musa Wada of the PDP.</p>
