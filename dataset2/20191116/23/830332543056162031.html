      <p>SUN PRAIRIE, Wis. - The Windy Kitty Cat Club hosted a cat show Saturday, but only household pets were allowed in an effort to give pets a chance to be in the spotlight and offer owners an opportunity to see what it's like to show cats.</p>
      <p>The ACFA Household Pet Cat Show held competitions for best dressed and best cat carrier, but beyond fashion, judges ranked cats based on health, cleanliness and attitude. </p>
      <p>Officials at the event said bringing a cat into public is a great way to socialize it. They said it's important because taking a cat to social places in a crate makes stressful trips, such as going to the vet, less anxiety-ridden for cats.</p>
      <p>The next Windy Kitty Cat Club cat show will be in Racine, Wisconsin, in January. </p>
