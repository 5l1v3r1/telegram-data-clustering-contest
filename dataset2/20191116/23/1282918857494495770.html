      <p>The Delhi Division of Northern Railway, in an effort to cut down energy consumption, have started using the 'head-on generation' (HOG) system for 32 pairs of its premium and express trains. This was accomplished after converting and successfully running the trains to ensure energy conservation. The Divisional Railway Manager, Delhi, SC Jain said that this system is expected to save around Rs. 65 crore per annum on diesel consumption of generator cars. </p>

      <blockquote>In a press statement, SC Jain, Divisional Railway Manager, Delhi, said, "The HOG system does not require any diesel oil consumption and as such will reduce air pollution and also noise pollution. It also provides uninterrupted illumination in the coaches”. </blockquote>

      <h3>The working of HOG system </h3>
      <p>The power that is provided to a running train is supplied via the power lines through a pantograph, this electricity is used to run the engine and haul the coaches. After the installation of the HOG system in the trains, the power supply will now be distributed to the trailing coaches for power needs. This system has been introduced in all the trains fitted with LHB coaches. At present, 11 pairs of Shatabdi, eight pairs of Rajdhani, two pairs of Duronto, one pair of Humsafar and 10 pairs of Express trains are running on the HOG system in the Delhi Division. </p>
