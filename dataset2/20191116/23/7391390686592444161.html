      <p>In Season 3 of <i>The Crown</i>, Princess Margaret (played with verve by Helena Bonham-Carter) begins a romance with Richard "Roddy" Llewellyn (Harry Treadaway), a landscape gardener 17 years her junior. As in real life, the affair precipitates the end of her already crumbling marriage to photographer Antony Armstrong-Jones when blurry paparazzi shots of the lovers vacationing on the Caribbean island of Mustique make the tabloid press. But where <i>The Crown</i> offers only a snapshot, there's a movie to be made: <a href="https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/tradition/a26291723/roddy-llewellyn-princess-margaret-boyfriend/">Princess Margaret and Roddy Llewellyn's relationship</a> lasted eight years.</p>
      <p>As reported by the Telegraph, the pair met in 1973 at the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/pubs/3343546/Edinburgh-Pub-Guide-The-Cafe-Royal-Scotland.html">Café Royal in Edinburgh</a>, where they were introduced by <a href="https://www.tatler.com/article/lady-anne-glenconner-lady-in-waiting-princess-margaret">Lady Anne Glenconner</a>, who served as Princess Margaret's lady-in-waiting for more than 30 years. Llewellyn remembered that meeting for the rest of his life, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1384450/I-followed-my-heart-says-Llewellyn.html">remarking in 2002 </a>after Margaret's death, "I discovered a warm and witty woman, possessing a strong sense of duty and dedication to her country's interests, who has honoured me with her friendship since that first house party that was so filled with fun and laughter."</p>
      <p>Lady Anne, though, later felt conflicted about making the introduction in light of its thorny aftermath, confessing in a<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5439705/The-Queen-opens-Princess-Margarets-love-life.html"> 2018 documentary</a> that the situation "was difficult for the Queen and I felt rather guilty." Llewellyn was <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/a28908055/princess-margaret-roddy-llewellyn-story-candal/">not the first</a> of Princess Margaret's affairs, nor was Armstrong-Jones faithful to Margaret throughout their marriage. But the paparazzi photos dismantled what little was left of the facade of a happy family.</p>
      <p>Netflix on YouTube</p>
      <p>After Margaret's separation from Armstrong-Jones was announced in March 1976, the <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a29613469/who-is-roddy-llewellyn-the-crown-season-3/">first royal separation since Henry VIII</a>, the press "<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1099594.stm">laid siege</a>" to Llewellyn's farm, compelling him to deliver a public statement: "<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=ZX01AgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=princess%2520margaret%2520divorce&amp;pg=PP336#v=onepage&amp;q=i%20am%20not%20prepared&amp;f=false">I am not prepared to comment </a>on any of the events of last week. I much regret any embarrassment caused to Her Majesty the Queen and the royal family, for whom I wish to express the greatest respect, admiration and loyalty." The Palace also issued <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1976/03/20/archives/margaret-and-snowdon-agree-to-separate-announcement-by-margarets.html?searchResultPosition=12">this terse statement</a>: "The Queen is naturally very sad at what has happened."</p>
      <p>As much ruckus as their relationship caused, it wasn't enough to dampen Llewellyn's affection for Princess Margaret. They continued seeing each other <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1099594.stm">until 1981</a>, and though Llewellyn ultimately married another woman and had three children, he always remembered his time with the princess warmly. "I found a fine friend who could steady my restless nature and offer wise counsel," he wrote in <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1384450/I-followed-my-heart-says-Llewellyn.html">an open letter </a>published by the <i>News of the World</i> following Margaret's death in 2002. In fact, some of the details included in <i>The Crown<i>'s</i></i> third season appear to be gleaned from that letter, in which Llewellyn recalls Her Royal Highness donning "a wig to sing a Sophie Tucker red hot momma number."</p>
      <p>Eventually, Lady Anne, too, was able to reconcile her misgivings about the role she played in the end of Margaret's marriage, not in the least because of some <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5439705/The-Queen-opens-Princess-Margarets-love-life.html">kind words reportedly offered by a fellow mourner</a>. Said Lady Anne, "After Princess Margaret's funeral, the Queen, she said, 'I'd just like to say, Anne, it was rather difficult at moments, but I thank you so much [for] introducing Princess Margaret to Roddy 'cause he made her really happy.'"</p>
