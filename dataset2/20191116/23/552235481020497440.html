      <h1>Austin MacPhee set for extended Hearts audition as Ann Budge ponders options</h1>
      <h2>The interim boss will have more time to make his case as Hearts' best option for their managerial vacancy.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T23:15:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 23:15</time> by <a rel="author">Gordon Waddell, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/gordon-waddell/</a></address>
      <p>Austin MacPhee has been guaranteed at least one more audition for the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a> job before he’s formally interviewed for it.</p>
      <p>And he’s been told he could even be given the chance to buy <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ann-budge">Ann Budge</a> time by taking them through to the winter break if he keeps winning.</p>
      <p>The Hearts owner has promised the interim head coach - currently on duty with Northern Ireland - he’ll definitely be in charge for their game against Kilmarnock on Saturday.</p>
      <p>He’ll then sit down within 48 hours to make his case for the gig on a permanent basis.</p>
      <p>Budge has already spoken to out-of-work candidates <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-mccann">Neil McCann</a>, Stuart McCall and Steve Cotterill, as well as new Hibs <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jack-ross">Jack Ross</a>, who is now obviously out of the running.</p>
      <p>Stage two is for her to target in-work bosses she believes are a good fit for the club - and Stephen Robinson remains on her radar, despite the £120,000 <i><b>Mailsport</b> </i>revealed it would take to prise him from the Motherwell dugout.</p>
      <p>But she’s understood to be determined to make the right decision rather than the quick one.</p>
      <p>And <i><b>Mailsport</b></i> believes that could yet see MacPhee take charge of the eight games they have in December.</p>
