      <p>PITTSBORO, N.C. — Authorities say three people have been arrested in North Carolina during a protest near a Confederate statue slated for removal.</p>
      <p>The News &amp; Observer reports that a fight erupted Saturday in Pittsboro when protesters who oppose the statue’s removal complained about counterprotesters standing near a protester’s vehicle.</p>
      <p>The Chatham County Sheriff’s Office said 52-year-old Allan Wayne Hall was charged with inciting a riot and simple affray; 29-year-old Calvin James Megginson was charged with simple assault; and 63-year-old Robert Butler was charged with inciting a riot. All three live in Pittsboro.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, a judge lifted an injunction that has blocked the county from removing the statute from where it has stood outside a courthouse since 1907. Several people have been arrested at previous protests.</p>
