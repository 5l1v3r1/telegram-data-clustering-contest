        <b>Wins over Slovakia and Macedonia respectively saw Croatia and Austria reach Euro 2020 on Saturday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Croatia and Austria each won on Saturday to join Netherlands and Germany in securing their places at Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>Both Croatia and Austria came into their latest fixtures knowing only a point was required to reach the finals next year, although Zlatko Dalic’s men threatened to make hard work of their progress.</p>
      <p>Playing their final qualifier, unlike Austria, who have another against Latvia to come, Croatia trailed at home to Slovakia until the 56th minute.</p>
      <p>Robert Bozenik had put the visitors in front, but Nikola Vlasic and Bruno Petkovic scored in quick succession approaching the hour-mark to turn the match on its head.</p>
      <p>Ivan Perisic completed a 3-1 victory after Slovakia’s Robert Mak was sent off, which sees World Cup finalists Croatia qualify as Group E winners.</p>
      <p>Hungary lie second but must visit third-place Wales – just one point back – next week. A draw there would open the door for Slovakia to advance with victory at home to Azerbaijan.</p>

      <p>Austria enjoyed a more straightforward outing, beating Macedonia 2-1 to join Poland in the top two in Group G.</p>
      <p>David Alaba and Stefan Lainer scored early in each half, meaning Vlatko Stojanovski’s 93rd-minute reply mattered not.</p>
