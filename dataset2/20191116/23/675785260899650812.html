      <h2>Christina Aguilera stopped off to browse Manchester Christmas market on Friday after she performed in the city</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T23:13:21+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 23:13</time> by <a rel="author">Molly Pike, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/molly-pike/</a></address>
      <p>Manchester Christmas markets might be the last place you expect to see a celeb, but a bonafide A-lister was spotted browsing the stalls on Friday.</p>
      <p>Christina Aguilera almost broke Twitter as she confirmed she'd stopped off to browse the festive wares after performing a concert in the city.</p>
      <p>Her <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> followers went into meltdown when she posted a picture of herself enjoying a warm drink in the middle of the market yesterday.</p>
      <p>The Genie in a Bottle hitmaker, 38, kept a low profile in a comfy white hoodie, black coat and a baseball cap, making her almost unrecognisable to passersby.</p>

      <p>A third joked: "Queen of going round the Manchester Christmas markets and probably paying £50 for a Nutella crepe on a paper plate."</p>
