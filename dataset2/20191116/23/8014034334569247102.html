      <p>A Stradivarius violin stolen four decades ago from the virtuoso Roman Totenberg and returned to his family by a federal prosecutor came alive again — at the crime scene.</p>
      <p>Nineteen-year-old star violinist Nathan Meltzer revived the prize instrument of the late Polish-born musician on Friday at a public concert in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He played the same music as Totenberg did minutes before his Stradivarius disappeared one night in 1980. The thief was a former student, and the violin was eventually found in a California attic.</p>
      <p>Recovered by the FBI, it was returned to Totenberg’s daughters four years ago by the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan.</p>
      <p>Nina, Jill and Amy Totenberg were at the Longy School of Music in Cambridge for Friday’s concert.</p>
      <p>The instrument is now on loan to the teenage soloist.</p>
