      <p>LOS ANGELES — The Golden Knights thought they had played well enough to end their losing streak Saturday.</p>
      <p>They erased 2-0 and 3-1 deficits against the Los Angeles Kings. They were disciplined, taking just two penalties overall and none in the final two periods.</p>
      <p>But it wasn’t enough. Left wing Jeff Carter, playing in his 1,000th NHL game, scored a tiebreaking goal off a deflection with 7:18 remaining to give the Kings a 4-3 win at Staples Center.</p>
      <p>The Knights (9-9-3) are 0-4-1 in their last five games. The Kings (8-11-1) won their third straight.</p>
      <p>“We got to capitalize there when it’s a one-goal game,” Knights left wing Max Pacioretty said. “I think the first two periods were pretty good. Third period was all right, but I think we got to have that little bit of killer instinct to close out a game. It just hasn’t been there lately. We have to find it quick.”</p>
      <p>Here’s what else stood out in the loss:</p>
      <p>
        <b>1. Special teams dig hole</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Knights controlled 5-on-5 play in the first period and had a 14-7 edge in shot attempts. But they trailed 2-0 after one period because of special teams.</p>
      <p>The Kings opened the scoring with a short-handed goal with 9:01 left in the first period. Left wing Adrian Kempe and center Blake Lizzotte got a 2-on-1, Kempe shot and Lizzotte put the rebound into the net.</p>
      <p>The Kings added a power-play goal 4:11 later when defenseman Drew Doughty’s shot deflected off goaltender Malcolm Subban and in.</p>
      <p>“It’s frustrating,” right wing Reilly Smith said. “I think we played a pretty good game. It’s just tough when you fall behind early and then play catch-up.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>2. Killer instinct lacking</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Knights dug out of their early hole with second-period goals from Pacioretty, left wing Jonathan Marchessault and center William Karlsson to tie the score at 3 entering the third period.</p>
      <p>Then they couldn’t finish. Carter tipped defenseman Matt Roy’s shot down through the five-hole of Subban to render the second-period comeback moot.</p>
      <p>The Knights fell to 0-1-2 when tied after two periods. They’ve been outscored 19-16 in the third.</p>
      <p>“We got to find that third period and come out there and dominate a third period,” coach Gerard Gallant said. “It seems like we’re scared to lose in the third period instead of going out there, being confident and trying to win.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>3. Numbers don’t reflect results</b>
      </p>
      <p>It’s tough to blame the Knights for lacking confidence.</p>
      <p>They say they’re playing decent hockey, but continue to come up empty. In their five-game losing streak, the Knights at 5-on-5 had more shot attempts in five games, more scoring chances in three and more expected goals in four.</p>
      <p>It didn’t matter. They’re out of the playoff picture after 21 games with a goal differential of minus-3. They have no time to mope, either, not with another division game against the Calgary Flames at 4 p.m. Sunday at T-Mobile Arena.</p>
      <p>“We’re going to get out of this,” defenseman Brayden McNabb said. “We’re a good team. We’ve been playing a lot better. We’re not getting results right now, but we have to stay with it. We can’t turn on each other. We have to stay positive as a group and move forward.”</p>
