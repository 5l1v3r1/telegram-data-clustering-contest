        <b>A famous win for Stefanos Tsitsipas saw off Roger Federer, but the Swiss star attempted to take some positives while admitting his errors.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Roger Federer conceded he had let chances slip through his fingers and made “pretty bad” mistakes as he crashed out of the ATP Finals with defeat to Stefanos Tsitsipas.</p>
      <p>The Swiss star went down 6-3 6-4 in London, taking only one of his 12 break-point opportunities to lose the semi-final in straight sets just two days on from a near-faultless victory over Novak Djokovic.</p>
      <p>It means he ends the year having not won any of the four grand slams or the season-ending event, with Sunday’s final to be contested by Dominic Thiem and Tsitsipas.</p>
      <p>Federer turns 39 in 2020 but, as he reflected on a year that saw him squander two championship points against Djokovic in the Wimbledon final, he is optimistic he will have plenty more opportunities to win top tournaments.</p>
      <p>“No doubt I had my chances,” Federer – who hit 26 unforced errors including two wayward smashes in his opening service game – said after his defeat, which leaves him without an ATP Finals title since 2011.</p>
      <p>“The break points were part of it. I had some good spells, but the spells where things were not working well, they were pretty bad.</p>
      <p>“Getting broken and missing two smashes in one game – that hasn’t happened in a long, long time or ever, so that was tough.</p>
      <p>“At this level, you just can’t have it happen, so that was pretty disappointing.”</p>
      <p>Of his 2020 hopes, Federer said: “I’ve got to keep on playing at the level like I have this year and then I will create some chances.</p>
      <p>“[I have] Got to take care of my body, listen to the signs, work well with the team and get the balance right with everything that’s happening in my life.”</p>

      <p>Federer had produced a fine display to see off Djokovic in the round-robin stage but conceded he cannot afford to let his level drop when big matches and important moments arrive in quick succession.</p>
      <p>He added: “When the matches come, it’s not maybe as easy as it was maybe 10, 15 years ago, where you’re just going to play very good day in, day out.</p>
      <p>“Maybe you need to do extra effort sometimes for that to happen. Maybe that’s what it felt like, just things were complicated.</p>
      <p>“But I’ve got to maybe do even a better job at figuring these moments out, because the opportunities were there. They were there in other moments as well this season, maybe Indian Wells [in a final defeat to Thiem] or Wimbledon.</p>
      <p>“That can change an entire season around, the confidence, the flow of things.”</p>
      <p>Federer retained an optimistic outlook going into another season on the ATP Tour, adding: “I’m happy [with] how I played this season. I thought I played some consistent, solid tennis and I’m extremely excited for next season.”</p>
