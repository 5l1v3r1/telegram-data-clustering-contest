      <p>There are still a few weeks left in the season, but we may have witnessed the catch of the year during the Ohio State-Rutgers game. Chris Olave made such a great play that even the opposing fans were in awe of his playmaking ability.</p>
      <p>Ohio State entered today’s matchup as overwhelming favorites. It didn’t take very long for the Big Ten powerhouse to jump out to a 35-7 lead before halftime.</p>
      <p>Despite having such a big lead in the third quarter, head coach Ryan Day decided to keep his starters in the game.</p>
      <p>Justin Fields threw an absolute bomb down the right sideline to Chris Olave, who somehow managed to catch the ball between his own legs.</p>
      <p>What makes it such an impressive catch by Olave is that he caught it with two defenders in his vicinity.</p>
      <p>Here’s the amazing catch by Olave:</p>

      <p>Olave has four receptions for 139 yards in this game. He’s averaging 34.8 yards per reception, which is just absurd regardless of the competition.</p>
      <p>Coming into this game, the sophomore wide receiver had 32 receptions for 445 yards and nine touchdowns.</p>
      <p>The Buckeyes can now afford to let Olave and the first-team offense rest as they’re in command against the Scarlet Knights.</p>
      <p>Do you think Olave made the catch of the season?</p>
