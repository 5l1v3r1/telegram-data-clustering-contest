      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/arsenal-fc/">Arsenal</a> will offer Borussia Monchengladbach <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/granit-xhaka/">Granit Xhaka</a> if they agree to sell them Denis Zakaria, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Zakaria is a rising star in Germany with Gladbach top of the Bundesliga and the 22-year-old coveted by a host of top clubs, including Manchester United.</p>
      <p>Arsenal are expected to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/granit-xhaka-open-newcastle-transfer-deciding-leave-arsenal-11149357/">offload their former captain Xhaka in the January transfer window</a> and the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenal-offer-granit-xhaka-borussia-20896461?8">Mirror</a> claim Unai Emery will use the midfielder to capture Zakaria.</p>
      <p>The defensive midfielder is under contract at Gladbach until 2022 and the German side may be tempted to cash in on him next summer.</p>

      <p>Xhaka joined Arsenal from Gladbach in 2016 and a return to the club may be appealing to the Swiss international.</p>
      <p>Arsenal will send Xhaka back to Gladbach if the Germans agree to give them first refusal on Zakaria when they decide to sell.</p>

      <p>Although Emery has not ruled out recalling Xhaka to the Arsenal team, the 27-year-old has not played since telling fans to ‘f*** off’ in reaction to being booed at the Emirates.</p>
      <p>Zakaria and Xhaka play together for their country and the Swiss captain has already marked his international team-mate out as a special player.</p>
      <p>‘His development is outstanding’ said Xhaka. ‘Having Denis in the national team next to me makes me feel better. But he has to stay tuned – now comes a very crucial phase for him.’</p>
      <p>Tottenham and United have been credited with an interest in Zakaria, who has scored twice from midfield for Gladbach this season.</p>
