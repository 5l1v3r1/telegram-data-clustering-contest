      <h1>The U.S. Army Is Working on a New Super 'Bullet' For Its Tanks</h1>
      <h2>New U.S. tanks and ammo should leave the Russians shaking.</h2>

      <p><b>Key Point:</b> Technologically advanced tanks and smart ammo on America's side rises above anything the Russian military can muster.</p>
      <p>The Army is now engineering a new Advanced Multi-Purpose 120mm ammunition round for a far-superior M1A2 SEP v4 Abrams tank variant for the 2020s and beyond --designed to be more lethal, faster, lighter weight, better protected, equipped with new sensors and armed with upgraded, more effective weapons, service officials said.  </p>
      <p>The new ammunition will replace four different kinds of ammunition with a single round.</p>
      <p>The AMP round will replace four tank rounds now in use. The first two are the M830, High Explosive Anti-Tank, or HEAT, round and the M830A1, Multi-Purpose Anti -Tank, or MPAT, round.</p>
      <p>The latter round was introduced in 1993 to engage and defeat enemy helicopters, specifically the Russian Hind helicopter, Army developers explained.  The MPAT round has a two-position fuse, ground and air, that must be manually set, an Army statement said.</p>
      <p>The M1028 Canister round is the third tank round being replaced. The Canister round was first introduced in 2005 by the Army to engage and defeat dismounted Infantry, specifically to defeat close-in human-wave assaults. Canister rounds disperse a wide-range of scattering small projectiles to increase anti-personnel lethality and, for example, destroy groups of individual enemy fighters.</p>
      <p>The M908, Obstacle Reduction round, is the fourth that the AMP round will replace; it was designed to assist in destroying large obstacles positioned on roads by the enemy to block advancing mounted forces, Army statements report.  </p>
      <p>AMP also provides two additional capabilities: defeat of enemy dismounts, especially enemy anti-tank guided missile, or ATMG, teams at a distance, and breaching walls in support of dismounted Infantry operations.</p>
      <p>The new ammunition data link will help tank crews determine which round is best suited for a particular given attack, developers said.</p>
