      <p>McGregor and Eve, 53, have been separating their British assets, with the Trainspotting star taking control of three jointly-owned companies.</p>
      <p>But he is expected to sign over their six-bed LA home next door to Marilyn Monroe’s old house.</p>
      <p>California Community Property laws state finances are split down the middle in a divorce, regardless of who earned the money.</p>
      <p>US family law expert Kristina Otterstrom said the parent who usually looks after the children normally gets the family house.</p>

      <p>The attorney said: “If you leave matters to a judge, the parent with custody of minor children will probably get to stay in the marital home.</p>
      <p>“One exception may be if neither spouse can afford to keep the home. In that case, a court may come up with a different solution.”</p>
      <p>McGregor has filed documents petitioning an LA judge to dissolve the marriage and declare the pair single before the divorce is finalised.</p>
      <p>People magazine in the US claims he states in court papers “that a termination of the status of our marriage will assist in [the] resolution of the balance of this matter”.</p>
      <p>The Star Wars actor is dating Mary Elizabeth Winstead, 34, his former co-star on TV show Fargo.</p>
      <p>In October 2017 The Scottish Sun on Sunday exclusively revealed the pair were spotted kissing in a London cafe.</p>
      <p>McGregor’s divorce has been contentious as he wants joint custody of he and Eve’s four children.</p>
      <p>But former production designer Eve has responded by asking for sole custody with visitation rights for their superstar father.</p>
      <p>The couple married in 1995 after meeting while working on legal TV drama Kavanagh QC.</p>
      <p>They lived in a £6million house in St John’s Wood, London, before moving full time to the States, where they bought their 1930s LA property in 2002 for £1.5million.</p>
      <p>Companies House records reveal that over the summer McGregor, from Crieff, Perthshire, became “a person with significant control” of three UK businesses the couple formed.</p>
      <p>Eve admitted she was upset her husband has moved to end their marriage but said: “My main concern is our four children are OK.”</p>
      <p>Last month McGregor admitted of his new relationship: “I am better. I am happier. I think that’s true.”</p>
      <p>Eve has hired hotshot Hollywood lawyer Laura Wasser for the divorce.</p>
      <p>The brief handled Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie’s split and wrote How to Divorce Without Destroying Your Family Or Bankrupting Yourself.</p>
      <p>She has also represented screen idols including Ryan Reynolds, Heidi Klum and Ashton Kutcher, and says she tries to build a “new family” out of the divorce wreckage.</p>
      <p>She says of her work: “We try to get them to a place where they are still a family, just not in a romantic relationship anymore — and to figure out a way of continuing to work together.”</p>
      <p>McGregor’s publicist was contacted for comment.</p>
