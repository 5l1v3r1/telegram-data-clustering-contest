Now, after being out of action for more than two years, Mirza had announced that she will be making her comeback at the 2020 ASB Classic as a warm-up heading into the Australian Open early next year. </p>

      <h3>Sania Mirza's professional career and achievements</h3>
      <p>Sania Mirza is the only Indian female tennis player to break into the top 30 of the WTA Singles rankings. She is also the first Indian female tennis player to win a Grand Slam title in doubles. The Padma Bhushan awardee has won numerous accolades across her career including doubles titles at Wimbledon and the Australian Open. Sania and Switzerland's Martina Hingis formed a great team and are considered to be one of the best pairs in women's tennis history. In fact, until 2013, Sania was ranked No.1 with WTA rankings in both, singles and doubles category. The successful pair of Mirza and Hingis decided to split in August 2016 after a mutual decision among both the players citing their last few under-par performances back then. Meanwhile, Sania Mirza hopes for a good performance in next year's Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo.</p>
