      <p>A man has been rescued from the water after his boat capsized near Mornington this morning. He has been taken to hospital for observation, with the boat yet to be salvaged.</p>
      <p>Police responded to reports of the boat capsizing around 6:25am and were told “the boat went down” around 500m north east of the Mornington pier.</p>
      <p>A man was found 300m offshore when he was rescued by a local boat operator.</p>
      <p>He was not injured during the incident and was taken to hospital for observation – efforts will be made later today to salvage the boat from the water.</p>
