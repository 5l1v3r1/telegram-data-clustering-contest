      <p>The <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14923/rangers/">Rangers</a> legend revealed he’s hanging up his boots after rupturing his Achilles tendon in an Old Firm charity game.</p>

      <p>And the former Scotland goalie admits he can’t risk another match.</p>
      <p>Goram said: “I snapped my Achilles — it’s knackered, it’s done.</p>
      <p>“I’ll never jog again. I’ll never play again which is hard. That’s me finished.</p>
      <p>“It doesn’t make me feel great. Before that you could play but you’d make a fool of yourself but when they said ‘You can’t play’, it’s the worst thing in the world.”</p>
      <p>The ex-Motherwell and Hibs keeper was playing with Marvin Andrews, 43, Charlie Miller, 43, Derek Ferguson, 52, and The Scottish Sun on Sunday columnist Frank McAvennie, 59, when he collapsed in agony last year.</p>
