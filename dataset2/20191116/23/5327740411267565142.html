      <p>Surrey RCMP is asking for the public’s help in finding a man missing for more than a week.</p>
      <p>Hyung “John” Lee was last seen in the 13300-block of Old Yale Road around 4 p.m. on Nov. 7, according to a release from police Saturday (Nov. 16).</p>
      <p>Police said the missing person’s case is “high risk” because of the length of time Lee has been missing.</p>
      <p>Lee’s family is concerned for his health and well-being, as it is out-of-character for Lee to be out of touch this long.</p>
      <p>Lee,who is Korean, is described as 5’7” tall, about 157 lbs., with black hair and brown eyes. He is 48 years old.</p>
      <p>He was last seen wearing a black jacket, black shirt, black pants and black leather dress shoes.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information about the whereabouts of this person is asked to contact the Surrey RCMP at 604-599-0502, or Crime Stoppers, if they wish to remain anonymous, at 1-800-222-8477 or <a href="https://www.solvecrime.ca/">solvecrime.ca</a>, quoting file number 2019-177967.</p>
