      <h2>X Factor: Celebrity judge Nicole Scherzinger had to be restrained by co-stars Louis Walsh and Simon Cowell after watching Try Star's steamy performance</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T23:57:59+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 23:57</time> by <a rel="author">Brogan-Leigh Hurst</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/nicole-scherzinger">Nicole Scherzinger</a> was restrained by fellow judges <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/louis-walsh">Louis Walsh</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/simon-cowell">Simon Cowell</a> after announcing she wants to "get naked" following Try Star's racy act.</p>
      <p>The 41-year-old singer and talent show judge couldn't help herself as she blurted it out to the audience.</p>
      <p>Trio Try Star danced in the rain as they showcased their toned six-pack abs in tight leather trousers.</p>
      <p>Nicole, who enjoyed their performance, began to touch her own body before she gushed: "That song was crazy and rain never looked better in London," before she gasped: "Uh!"</p>
      <p>Louis admitted he'd never seen Nicole look so excited as she got the crowd hyped.</p>

      <p>Viewers of the show were also left cringing over Try Star's Levi as he got stuck in a vest during a sexy wet scene.</p>
      <p>The hunky rugby player, 21, performed the saucy stunt in front of the judges and a large audience - which went terribly wrong.</p>
      <p>Performing with band mates Thom Evans and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/ben-foden">Ben Foden</a> , the star stripped down to just his trousers.</p>
      <p>But as he prepared to make the move, his vest got tangled around both legs which turned into total embarrassment.</p>

      <p>Fans took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> to discuss the funny moment as it happened.</p>
      <p>One fan admitted: "I'm actually embarrassed for Try Star like that was so cringey #CelebrityXFactor", as another responded: "It was like 3 drunk dads at a wedding".</p>
      <p>Another confessed: "Well Try Star were trying too hard #XFactorCelebrity".</p>

      <p>Others seemed to enjoy the not-so-sexy performance, with one saying: "Try Star definitely know how to please the Female population".</p>
      <p>A second wrote: "Okay tonight's performance just made me love Try Star even more".</p>
      <p>The group sang X Ambassadors' hit Boom in hope to set pulses racing and gain votes.</p>

      <p>During last week's performance, Thom hit out at Louis after he called the star a "backing singer".</p>
      <p>Louis claimed Levi was the star and his co-members were just "backing singers".</p>
      <p>Offered the microphone by host Dermot O'Leary, Thom decided to hit back offering his own dig.</p>

      <p>He told him: "Well to be fair Louis, you've been a backing singer to Simon for most of your life."</p>
      <p>Simon immediately stood up and applauded the comment, as Nicole looked on in shock.</p>
