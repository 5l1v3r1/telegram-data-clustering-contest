        <b>UEFA Euro 2020 Qualifier</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Result:</b> Germany 4-0 Belarus</p>
      <p><b>Date:</b> 16 November 2019</p>
      <p><b>Venue:</b> Borussia-Park</p>
      <p>Germany qualified for the 2020 European Championship after an emphatic 4-0 victory over Belarus at the Borussia-Park Stadium on Saturday evening.</p>
      <p>The home side started with an all-out attacking trio led by Serge Gnabry, Timo Werner and Leon Goretzka, with Matthias Ginter in for the suspended Emre Can.</p>
      <p>Germany looked to prize open the visitors in the earlier moments, as a stinging shot from Ginter had Alyaksandr Hutar at full stretch with the parry eventually going behind for a corner.  Die Mannschaft threatened once again before the 20th minute mark though Kimmich long-range shot rattled against the top of the side-netting.</p>
      <p>Belarus were soon on the charge and closed in to the opener eight minutes to the interval following a rasping curler from Ihar Stasevich, but Manuel Neuer went full stretch to parry the forward.</p>
      <p>The pressure finally paid off for the Germans when Ginter flicked home from point-blank range following a low cross from Gnabry three minutes before halftime.</p>
      <p>Germany pushed to second gear four minutes from the restart as Goretzka picked his spot to cushion home a well-timed delivery from Toni Kroos to double the lead.</p>
      <p>Ginter, who landed the opener, carved out the third goal on 55 minutes when an exchange of passes on the right ended with Kroos calmly slotting beyond Hutar.</p>
      <p>Neuer denied the visitors a consolation when he got down to push Stasevich’s spot-kick behind for a corner with 15 minutes to go following a foul in the danger area.</p>
      <p>Germany drew the contest to a close in the last seven minutes when Kroos twisted and turned in the area for a delightful near post finish past Hutar as the hosts ran out 4-0 winners to secure qualification.</p>
