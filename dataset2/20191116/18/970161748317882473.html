      <h1>Venice's St. Mark's Square re-opens after worst flooding in decades</h1>

      <p>Venice’s famous St. Mark’s Square has been re-opened to residents and tourists after it was closed due to a series of high tidal waters that devastated the city centre.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, the public returned to the square to slosh in the remaining shallow water and stroll around, following almost a week of the worst flooding the city has seen in decades.</p>
      <p>Despite sunny skies, the city remained on edge due to possibly more wind-propelled high tidal waters during the weekend, as the water began to rise again in the square.</p>
      <p>At noon on Saturday the square was inundated with more than 8 inches of water.</p>
      <p>Museums filled up again with tourists and the city’s gondolas were back in business but they were expected to shut down on Sunday due to further threats.</p>

      <p>The weather forecast for Sunday is even worse and the high water mark is expected to reach 5.2ft above sea level.</p>

      <p>Late on Tuesday, water levels in the historic Italian city reached 6ft 1in above sea level, resulting in its worst floods since 1966.</p>
      <p>Luigi Brugnaro, the city’s mayor, estimated damages from the flooding would reach at least €1 billion (£856,192,063) but the final figures are yet to be calculated.</p>
      <p>‘Venice is once again being watched by the world and it needs to show that it can succeed and pick itself back up,’ the mayor told Gazzettino and Messaggero newspapers.</p>
      <p>The mayor added that programmes were being set up to help compensate residents, with families expecting to receive up to €5,000 (£4,317) and businesses up to €20,000 (£17,123).</p>

      <p>Among those recovering from Tuesday’s devastating high waters was Sabrina Laggia and her husband Alfredo, who own a stone jewelry workshop near St. Mark’s Square.</p>
      <p>She was dreading forecasts for more high water on Sunday, adding: ‘We have been here 30 years and we have never seen anything like this’.</p>

      <p>Alfredo said they used to feel safe if the forecast said anything up to 4.6ft but they were shocked when it surged way above that on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>They spent the night moving their creations to higher shelves in their store but when the levels rose so high there was no way of saving them.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, the government declared a state of emergency, approving €20 million (£17,123,841) to help Venice repair the most urgent damage.</p>
      <p>Built on a series of tiny islets amid a system of canals, Venice is particularly vulnerable to a combination of rising sea levels due to climate change coupled with the city’s well-documented sinking into the mud.</p>
      <p>The sea level in Venice is 4 inches higher than it was 50 years ago, according to the city’s tide office.</p>

      <p>This week’s devastation has left Italians exasperated at the long delay in building the city’s Moses flood defence project.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Moses consists of a series of movable barriers in the lagoon that can be raised when high winds and high tides combine to threaten to send high tides rushing across the city.</p>
      <p>Completion of the multibillion-euro project, under construction since 2003, has been delayed by corruption scandals, cost overruns and opposition from environmentalists worried about its effects on Venice’s delicate lagoon ecosystem.</p>
      <p>‘They need to finish the Moses tomorrow,’ said Sabrina Laggia. ‘Not next year.’</p>
