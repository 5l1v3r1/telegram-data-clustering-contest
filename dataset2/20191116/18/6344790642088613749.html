      <h1>AEG and USAopoly are Teaming Up for New SMASH UP Factions</h1>

      <p><b><i>Smash Up</i></b> is probably my favorite tabletop game out there. I think it’s a lot of fun to take two very unrelated factions and put them together. Well, the hit game from AEG has decided to team up with USAopoly for officially licensed factions starting in 2020! Who could they be bringing? I am very excited, although I did really enjoy the parody factions that were clearly based on franchises like <b><i>Pokémon</i></b>, <b><i>Star Wars</i></b>, <b><i>Game of Thrones</i></b>, and many more.</p>
      <blockquote>The award-winning “shufflebuilding” game allows fans to draft decks of fictitious dream teams and pit them against other campy collections in a battle to dominate targeted bases. Through ongoing play, players familiarize with and combine mechanics unique to each of their Factions to best their opponents’ point values.</blockquote>
      <p><b>Paul Peterson</b>, the designer of Smash Up, shared his enthusiasm about working with USAopoly:</p>
      <blockquote>The Op has consistently put out some of the highest quality games in the industry. By pairing with the design team from AEG, the Smash Up game we are building together is going knock the fans’ socks off!</blockquote>
      <p>More information will be revealed at AEG’s 2020 March Smashness as well as other future events, and I cannot wait!</p>
