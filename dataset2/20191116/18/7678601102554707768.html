      <p>Two suspected terrorists were shot dead while one member of the National Police’s Densus 88 counterterrorism squad was injured in an exchange of gunfire in Datar city, Hamparan Perak district, Deli Serdang regency in North Sumatra on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The two alleged terrorists, as yet unidentified, died after being shot by Densus 88 officers. Their bodies have been taken to the Bhayangkara Police Hospital in Medan.</p>
      <p>North Sumatra Police chief Ins. Gen. Agus Andrianto said the exchange of fire took place when a team of Densus 88 officers were searching a location suspected to be the hiding place of alleged terrorists following a suicide bombing attack against the Medan Police headquarters on Wednesday. The attack killed the bomber and injured six people.</p>
      <p>Agus said police conducted raids on several locations, one of which was the site of the shoot-out in Datar city.</p>
      <p>“An exchange of fire broke out in the location between a group of alleged terrorists and members of Densus 88. Two alleged terrorists died,” he said on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Besides the two who died, the squad also arrested three others they accuse of being terrorists in Aceh province.</p>
      <p>Agus said that members of Densus 88 and the North Sumatra Police were still hunting for more members of the group behind the suicide bombing.</p>
      <p>Because of their investigation, police had apprehended several people, along with raw materials for explosives, during raids on several locations.</p>
      <p>“Since the incident at the Medan Police headquarters, we have so far arrested 14 people, nine of whom could be named suspects. We also found low-explosive bomb materials,” Agus added. (rin)</p>
