      <h2>Harry Redknapp has slammed Tottenham for their 'relegation form' after admitting he thought they could be title contenders</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T18:31:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 18:31</time> by <a rel="author">Josh Challies</a></address>
      <p>Former Tottenham boss Harry Redknapp has admitted he made an error with his pre-season prediction for Spurs, slamming their 'relegation form' since January.</p>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino's side looked to be on the rise after catching the eye again last season, reaching the Champions League final, but their Premier League campaign so far has been disastrous.</p>
      <p>With just 12 matches played, <a href="https://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Spurs </a>find themselves eleven points behind the top four spots and just four positions above the relegation zone, leading to questions about the long-term future of many key figures at the club.</p>
      <p>The decline in form hasn't just occurred since the start of the campaign though, with Spurs' slump tracing back to January, but <a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/harry-redknapp">Redknapp </a>believed that Pochettino's side would have been able to shake their malaise and been close contenders with Manchester City and Liverpool for the titlle.</p>
      <p>“I honestly thought at the start of the year, I looked at their squad and they’ve got a good group of players there and they signed the big midfield player [Tanguy] Ndombele for £60m, I thought Tottenham would push Liverpool and Man City very, very close. I thought they’d get closer than last year," he told TalkSport.</p>
      <p>“But their form has carried on from last season. If you look at their form from January to now, it’s almost relegation form! They’ve been on such a terrible run, especially in away games. They never win away.</p>

      <p>“A couple of years back when they had Kyle Walker and Danny Rose at full-back, they were absolutely destroying teams with their pace down the sides and Eriksen pulling the strings in midfield, but they don’t look anywhere near the same team at the moment.</p>
      <p>“They’ve been very disappointing. I’m not sure where they’ll finish.”</p>
