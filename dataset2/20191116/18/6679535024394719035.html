      <p>Shekhar C. Mande, Secretary, Department for Scientific and Industrial Research, has said that science and technology has shaped the country since Independence and today the country is attempting to embrace globalisation.</p>
      <p>Dr. Mande, who is also Director General, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, New Delhi, was speaking as chief guest on the second day of the 27th convocation of Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE) at KMC Greens here on Saturday.</p>
      <p>He said that students would have heard the buzz words such as big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. “I’m reminded about a quote when we talk of big data. It says, all the data is not information; all the information is not knowledge and all the knowledge is not wisdom,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Data is actually what is presented to you during your educational career. All the days you spent during your school and college you have been presented with lots of data. Many of the good teachers attempted to convert that data into information, some of the outstanding teachers converted that information into knowledge and imparted that knowledge to you. And so, it is your own choice to convert the knowledge gained here to wisdom and chart your own course in your career and life,” he said.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, Dr. Mande quoted the seven sins which Mahatma Gandhi had said can destroy life. He asked the students to take it up as the guiding principles; Wealth without work, Pleasure without conscience, Science without humanity, Knowledge without character, Politics without principle, Commerce without morality, and Worship without sacrifice.</p>
      <p>The students who bagged gold medal are Hawa Bachoo Hashim (B. Pharm, MCOPS); Amit (BHM, WGSHA), Megana Pai K. (B. Arch, MSAP), Divya Kunjappa S. (ME, Embedded System, MSIS), and Deepika T. (MBA, MIM).</p>
