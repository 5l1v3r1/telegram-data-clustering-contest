      <h1>Lawless lasses: The 11 female criminals to be wary of in the North East</h1>
      <h2>Cruel and cunning crooks who prove women can be just as bad as men</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T18:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author">Sophie Doughty</a></address>
      <p>These cruel and cunning female crooks give the so-called 'fairer sex' a bad name.</p>
      <p>Statistically men are far more likely to be arrested or prosecuted than women.</p>
      <p>Male offenders or suspects accounted for 85% of arrests made by police across the UK in 2017/2018, the latest figures available.</p>
      <p>In the same year 74% of those prosecuted were male and 26% female.</p>
      <p>However, courts here on Tyneside have seen their fair share of cunning and cruel criminals in the dock, over recent years.</p>
      <p>And today we take a look at some of our lawless lasses, who have proven that women can be just as bad as men.</p>

      <p>Despicable heroin addict Stainsby stole from a vulnerable old lady who was using a cash machine to feed her habit.</p>
      <p>The 90-year-old victim had just withdrawn £200 in cash from an ATM in Gateshead when 32-year-old Stainsby plucked the cash from her pocket</p>
      <p>Stainsby, of Eslington Court, Gateshead, pleaded guilty to theft at South Tyneside Magistrates Court and earlier this month she was given an 18-month community order with 12 months of drug rehabilitation, and ordered to repay £200 in compensation to her victim, as well as an £80 fine.</p>
      <p>Following the case Northumbria Police's Neighbourhood Inspector for the area, Mick Robson, said he believed Stainsby had deliberately picked the victim knowing she would be easy prey.<br/><br/>He said: "We have no doubt that she targeted this woman because of her vulnerability and because she thought it was a quick way to get her drug fix.<br/><br/>"This was a very distressing incident for the victim but she has been fantastic with the police and has been incredibly brave."</p>

      </p>
      <p>Cruel Keith sent wicked Facebook messages to her former sister-in-law − including one saying: “Hope cancer kills you and the rest of your sick family”, after splitting from her ex.</p>
      <p>Keith had been involved in an acrimonious split from her partner, who said their relationship was beset with controlling, abusive and jealous behaviour.</p>
      <p>The ex had told Keith, through solicitors, to stop communicating directly with him, in January this year.</p>
      <p>But 11 days later, Keith, who had not spoken to the man’s sister for around three years, sent abusive messages to her on Facebook that left her fearful, Newcastle Crown Court heard.</p>
      <p>One included the words “hope cancer kills you and the rest of your sick family”, made reference to “bombs”, called her a “fat ****” and while also making reference to her children’s school.</p>
      <p>Another said she had been watching her and threatened to “stab you”, “cut you and your kids” and a third said “cancer leads to death, you’re next”.</p>
      <p>Keith, 27, of East View, Wideopen, North Tyneside, pleaded guilty to sending an electronic communication with intent to cause distress or anxiety.</p>
      <p>At the time of the offence, Keith was already on a suspended sentence, imposed last May, for criminal damage and using threatening or abusive words and behaviour in relation to offences against her neighbours, and was sentenced in June for making a false 999 call.</p>
      <p>For breaching the suspended sentence she was fined £25 and for the Facebook threats she was given a 12-month community order.</p>

      <p>Dangerous serial arsonist Cooper has been given a life sentence after setting fire to her living room while her guest was asleep.</p>
      <p>The high risk fire-starter caused neighbours to be evacuated after torching her home after a disagreement.</p>
      <p>Last year Newcastle Crown Court heard how the  43-year-old, who has previous for arson, handed herself in to police and told them “I’m going to do life for this”.</p>
      <p>Judge Tim Gittins said nobody was physically hurt in the latest blaze although Cooper’s house, but that the consequences could have been a lot worse.</p>
      <p>He said: “It could so easily have been different."</p>
      <p>The court heard Cooper had invited a homeless friend into her bedsit, which was one in a block of six, at Thornhill Gardens, off Tunstall Road, Sunderland, so he could use her facilities and have a proper rest in June.</p>
      <p>But, after a disagreement on June 9, she set fire to his sleeping bag while he slept in her bed and then left the property.</p>
      <p>Jailing Cooper for life in September 2018, Judge Gittins said Cooper must serve a minimum term of two years but warned she will only be released if and when the parole board consider her to be safe.</p>

      <p>The mum, and her male accomplice,  ordered food to be delivered to an empty house then lay in wait to hold up the driver when he turned up.</p>
      <p>A court heard the man held a knife to the victim's torso while Lowes pointed a handgun at him.</p>
      <p>They then robbed the terrified driver of his £200 takings and food from his car during the hold-up robbery in Byker, Newcastle.</p>
      <p>However, Lowes had used her mobile phone to place the £44 order and when police contacted the Just East app and they were able to get her number, email and home address.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old, of Eastfield House, Walker, Newcastle, was branded dangerous last month as she was jailed for four years at Newcastle Crown Court after pleading guilty to robbery</p>

      <p>This shameless thief burgled one home and attempted to raid two others just around the corner from her own street.</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old tried the doors of a number of homes on Milton Street, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/south-shields">South Shields</a>, during a cynical crime spree earlier this year.</p>
      <p>After managing to enter one empty house, McFarlane hunted for valuables and pocketed a stash of jewellery and even took a set of spare keys.</p>
      <p>Carrying her loot in a number of plastic bags, she then popped into a nearby shop and bought groceries before returning home - just five minutes’ walk away from the home she had raided.</p>
      <p>McFarlane refused to cooperate with police when interviewed, but later admitted burglary, two counts of attempted burglary and breach of a suspended sentence with the weight of evidence against her overwhelming.</p>
      <p>On October 4, she was jailed for 919 days - more than two-and-a-half years.</p>

      <p>This crack cocaine-smoking mother pushed past a vulnerable resident at an old folks’ home then stole money from his trouser pocket.</p>
      <p>Carr deliberately targeted the elderly man at the care complex while high on drugs, Newcastle Crown Court heard.</p>
      <p>Having got into his home at Lincoln Court, in Hebburn, she took £220 from his jeans, which were on the floor.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Emma Dowling told Newcastle Crown Court: “The occupant was present, he was vulnerable and he was targeted.”</p>
      <p>The 39-year-old,  of Howe Street, Hebburn, who has convictions for 63 previous offences including a previous home raid for which she was jailed, pleaded guilty to burglary and was given a suspended prison sentence, last month</p>
      <p>Carr was sentenced to two years imprisonment, suspended for two years, with drug rehabilitation requirements and a six- month curfew from 5pm to 8am.</p>

      <p>Banton targeted a woman as she withdrew money at a cash machine.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old, of no fixed abode, tussled with the victim after she took out £200, which she snatched from her grasp.</p>
      <p>However, security guards who had been working nearby, in Gateshead, intervened and stopped her.</p>
      <p>Banton, who was already on two suspended prison sentences at the time, was found to be in possession of a screwdriver when police searched her.</p>
      <p>In September she was jailed for 12 months at Newcastle Crown Court after admitting robbery and having an offensive weapon.</p>
      <p>The victim was at an ATM on Coatsworth Road in Gateshead, on April 3 this year when she was targeted.</p>

      <p>Roberts lashed out with a knife during an ugly street brawl during which two armed men were left with five stab wounds each.</p>
      <p>Jordan Pearce's wounds required eight hours of surgery, and Mark Alder's five cuts needed stitches at hospital after the pair came off worse in a disturbance.</p>
      <p>Newcastle Crown Court heard in September how the brawl, on Beach Road in South Shields, broke out last November when Pearce and Alder turned up at a house where Samantha Roberts was staying, armed with baseball bats and started banging on the door.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Richard Herrmann said a fight, involving others who joined in or watched, very quickly erupted and was caught on CCTV.</p>
      <p>Roberts, 30, of Sea Road, South Shields, was jailed for 13 months.</p>
      <p>Pearce, 26, of Girtin Road, South Shields, who also admitted an unrelated knife possession charge, was locked up for 16 months.</p>

      <p>This bingo-playing burglar brazenly fleeced a vulnerable 91-year-old dementia sufferer.</p>
      <p>Cruel Robinson, 60, was caught on camera stealing from the frail victim at sheltered accommodation in the West End of Newcastle.</p>
      <p>Police had installed covert cameras at the victim’s flat after money began going missing.</p>
      <p>She was described in court as “easily confused, forgetful and far too trusting” and relied on carers going in three times a day to help her.</p>
      <p>On viewing the footage officers discovered Robinson, who knew the victim from bingo, was the unlikely thief.</p>
      <p>Last month Robinson, of Frosterley Place, Arthurs Hill, Newcastle, who had no previous convictions, was given a suspended prison sentence and put on a year-long curfew after she admitted two counts of burglary.</p>
      <p>The court heard the victim was living at Iris Steadman House, in Arthur’s Hill, when the offences</p>
      <p>The victim’s carer said in a victim impact statement: “She is a very vulnerable person who should not be exploited due to her age and disability and is entitled to care and help.</p>
      <p>“No one should be targeted in this way.”</p>
      <p>The warden at the sheltered accommodation added: “I can’t believe someone would deliberately target such a vulnerable and lovely elderly lady.</p>

      <p>Cruel carer Reed also made a dementia sufferer her prey.</p>
      <p>The thief abused the trust of her 88-year-old victim by withdrawing more than £8,400 from her account over 23 occasions.</p>
      <p>Newcastle Crown Court heard the 53-year-old told police she had taken the money because she was “hard up”.</p>
      <p>The court was told that her formerly “very sociable” victim has been left unable to trust anyone except family members after the betrayal.</p>
      <p>Stuart Graham, prosecuting, said at the time of the offences the victim was housebound and looked after by carers at her home.</p>
      <p>Reed, who was employed by an agency at the time, would withdraw cash for her as part of her duties.</p>
      <p>But the court heard that during her time caring for the woman there were 23 “unaccounted for cash withdrawals for amounts of up to £400”.</p>
      <p>Mr Graham said: “The defendant said in interview it was because she was hard up, and spent the money on whatever she wished.</p>
      <p>“It was done while the victim was in and out of states of dementia.”</p>
      <p>A relative of the victim told the court: “When we discovered the thefts from her bank account she was very emotional and distressed.</p>
      <p>“She felt she had been an easy target and was saddened that someone felt they could help themselves to her savings.</p>
      <p>“She no longer trusts anyone other than family.”</p>
      <p>Reed, of Adderlane Road, Prudhoe, Northumberland, was found guilty of theft</p>
      <p>She was sentenced to 24 months in prison, suspended for 24 months, in July.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Shameful Spalding stole from a vulnerable 98-year-old who was supposed to be her friend.</p>
      <p>The 59-year-old was trusted to help the victim, having grown close to her over a period of 15 years, initially while working as her cleaner.</p>
      <p>A court heard she would carry out various tasks for the elderly lady, including doing her shopping, and was entrusted with her bank card.</p>
      <p>But in a shameful campaign of thefts spanning a year, Spalding helped herself to her savings - prosecutors claimed it was more than £8,000 but she pleaded guilty on the basis it was no more than £2,000.</p>
      <p>It was only when post was redirected to the victim’s nephew that Spalding’s criminal behaviour was exposed when he looked at her Post Office account statement and noticed unexplained withdrawals.</p>
      <p>Once rumbled, she was apologetic, returned £500 of the stolen cash and said she didn’t want the police involved.</p>
      <p>In September Spalding, of Woodford, Allerdene, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/gateshead">Gateshead</a>, who pleaded guilty to theft between August last year and August this year, was given a suspended prison sentence and ordered to do unpaid work.</p>
      <p>Judge Penny Moreland, at Newcastle Crown Court, told her the only reason she was not being sent immediately to prison was the fact she is the carer for her terminally-ill husband.</p>
      <p>Spalding, who has no previous convictions, was sentenced to eight months suspended for 12 months with 100 hours unpaid work and must pay £1,500 compensation at a rate of £100 a month.</p>
