      <p>Exeter City wing-back Randall Williams said that the Grecians need to improve their attacking play after drawing a blank against a dogged Cheltenham Town side.</p>
      <p>The Grecians had more possession and created much the better chances at St James Park, but failed to consistently trouble Scott Flinders in the Robins’ goal.</p>
      <p>Williams was City’s best player on the day and constantly won the battle against the opposing wing-back Chris Hussey, but speaking after the game, he said that if City want to go and get promoted, they have to go out and score more goals.</p>

      <p>He said: “I just think we have to be better going forward. Defensively we were very good today but going forward we need a bit of work.</p>
      <p>“If we are to dominate games the way we have been doing, we have got to get results. There has been a few games where we have just not had the end product. We got into good areas but we have to put better delivery in for the strikers to finish.</p>
      <p>“If I’m not scoring or assisting, I don’t feel that I have done enough. It doesn’t matter how many times I rinse the full back, I’ve got to produce at the end of the day.”</p>
      <p>City only had seven shots on goal, but only two were on target, and the closest they game to scoring was probably a Jack Sparkes effort from 30 yards that Cheltenham keeper Scott Flinders palmed away, with Ryan Bowman and Williams also have chances from inside the box that they dragged wide, with Williams also failing to find Alex Fisher with a square ball that would have left him with an almost open goal.</p>
      <p>Williams added: “I thought we dominated today for large amounts but we have to put the chances away. I messed up one that I should have given to Alex Fisher and nine times out of ten I would have done so, but things like that happen.</p>

      <p>“We have kept a lot of clean sheets this season so defensively we are where we want to be, but if we want to go and get promoted, we do have to go out and score goals, as at the end of the day, goals win games.</p>
      <p>“Cheltenham were a good side and they got a lot of numbers behind the ball but we didn’t quite have enough to break them down.</p>
      <p>“I’m sure they’ll be up there at the end of the season and if we can dominate a side like them, then we’ll be up there.”</p>
      <p>Next up on Tuesday night for the Grecians is an FA Cup replay against Cambridge United, and Williams said: “The FA Cup is a massive tournament. We want to go out and win on Tuesday and I think we are good enough to do so.”</p>
