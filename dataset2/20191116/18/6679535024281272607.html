      <h2>Installation made of 7,000 plastic bottles draws crowds</h2>

      <p>A ‘blue whale’ jumping out of the long pond in front of the Regional Science Centre and Planetarium is the latest tourist attraction in the city. Students, who have always been the greatest patrons of the centre, is thronging the place increasingly these days to get a look at the ‘whale’, which has, in just a couple of days, become a symbol of people’s cruelty to marine creatures.</p>
      <p>The whale installation that weighs around 140 kg is made up of around 7,000 plastic bottles. Conceptualised by the employees at the centre as part of their campaign against plastic, it took a team led by technical assistants V.P. Manoharan and Justin Joseph around three months to finish the project in time for Children’s Day.</p>
      <p>“We wanted to give the children something new to think about on this day, something that would make a difference,” said Mr. Justin.</p>
      <p>The team, over three months, collected the bottles from the premises of the centre, nearby offices, supermarkets and the Sarovaram Biopark. Most of them were discarded irresponsibly by visitors.</p>
      <p>They named the installation ‘New species in the ocean’. “It is estimated that the plastic dumped in the ocean would outnumber marine species by 2050. It would also destroy all other species. Our attempt is to create awareness against plastic dumping,” said Mr. Justin.</p>
      <p>The team is now seeking the Corporation’s permission to set up a similar installation somewhere in the city to spread further awareness on the issue.</p>
