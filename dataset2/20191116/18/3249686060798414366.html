      <p><b><a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/hyuna">HyunA</a></b>, who recently released <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/video/2019/11/hyuna-blooms-a-beautiful-garden-in-flower-shower-mv">her comeback song "Flower Shower,"</a> treated her fans once again. Fans who came to attend her November 16 <b>MBC</b>'s '<b>Show Music Core</b>' broadcast were gifted with a special tribute of down jackets of a brand she has been a model for years. She distributed jackets in different sizes, lengths, and colors to her fans so they could choose the one that suits their taste. </p>
      <p>She also spent quality time with her fans, taking selfies with their phones and putting stickers on their hands. One of the fans shared that the reason HyunA put heart-shaped stickers on their hands was that she felt bad she couldn't extend her comeback promotion for another week as fans have expected. Check out more photos and a video clip below! </p>
