      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: UK's longest-serving prisoner, 71-year-old John Massey, has genes that may have made him more likely to be a murderer, including brain defects that mean he lacks fear and empathy</h2>

      <p>Most people’s idea of a psychopath would be someone like John Massey.</p>
      <p>Thrown out of a pub one night, he returned with a shotgun and blasted a bouncer to death at point blank range.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old gangster then became one of Britain’s longest serving prisoners – 43 years inside after escaping three times.</p>
      <p>Now 71, he has had a brain scan and other tests for a TV show to find out exactly what drove him to kill all those years ago.</p>
      <p>Chillingly, doctors found his genes may have made him more likely to murder.</p>
      <p>And brain defects meant he lacked fear and empathy.</p>
      <p>Coupled with a painful childhood in care, Massey possessed a perfect storm of risk factors for committing the most heinous of crimes, psychologists say.</p>
      <p>The scan revealed he had a small amygdala – part of the brain that controls emotion like fear.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Prof Adrian Raine, a ­neuro-criminologist who has ­studied the brains of convicted killers across the world, said: “If the amygdala is shrunken you become a fearless individual.</p>
      <p>“In John’s life, that’s of ­significance. Sticking a gun in someone’s chest – you’ve got to have a certain lack of fear to be able to do something like that.</p>
      <p>“And the amazing thing is that shrunken amygdalas are also found in psychopaths.”</p>
      <p>The scan also revealed an ­enlarged striatum, which makes up the reward ­system in the brain.</p>
      <p>Prof Raine went on: “John’s actions were partly driven by a brain that was always seeking rewards. The ultimate reward for John that night was revenge.”</p>

      <p>DNA tests showed Massey also has a gene that blunts stress.</p>
      <p>After establishing the ­impairments, the experts were keen on seeing whether childhood traumas may have acted as an environmental trigger.</p>
      <p>He was abandoned by his ­mother at an early age as she struggled to bring up six kids.</p>
      <p>Massey said: “I remember my mum taking me to my first children’s home. I was set up to ride a red tricyle round the garden.</p>
      <p>"By the time I completed the circuit my mum had gone. I screamed blue murder.</p>
      <p>“They had to drag me into the house. I just wanted to run down the road and find my mum.</p>
      <p>“When I was there I resented every minute of it. I can’t ­recall any happy times.”</p>

      <p>Massey ended up in borstal then became a bank robber. In 1975 he was having a night out with pals at a pub disco in London’s East End when they got into a row with fellow drinkers.</p>
      <p>A brawl ensued with doormen in which an associate was glassed in the face before they left the club.</p>
      <p>Bent on ­revenge, Massey’s mob grabbed handguns and shotguns and ­returned to the pub, The Cricketers in Clapton.</p>
      <p>“We wanted to bring them back down to earth,” recalled Massey, a former underworld driver.</p>
      <p>“I pressed the gun up to his chest and said, ‘Get back inside.’ For some unimaginable reason the guy thought he was more ­powerful than a gun. Because the gun was levelled at his chest, that’s where he got hit.”</p>

      <p>Massey then stood over the body of 30-year-old Charlie Higgins and fired five rounds at the bar.</p>
      <p>A judge jailed him for at least 20 years for ­murder but Massey ended up serving twice that for his many escapes.</p>
      <p>One time he ended up on the run in Spain. He last broke out by climbing over a wall at Pentonville jail when he was 64.</p>
      <p>Forensic psychologist Dr Vicky Thakordas-Desai has spent 20 years interviewing Britain’s most violent offenders in prison. She said: “We know now that ­maternal abandonment can turn on and off certain genes.”</p>
      <p>She said the feeling of early neglect may have numbed his emotions while also stunting the development of his personality and the structure of the ­developing brain which, she said, “increases the risk of developing a psychopathic personality”.</p>
      <p>Prof Raine added: “All these factors can create a psychopathic personality disorder, which is characterised by a lack of feeling or empathy for other people, a lack of remorse, a lack of guilt.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“John was showing rather callous, psychopathic-like behaviour sticking that gun into the ­bouncer’s chest then later stepping over the dead body and shooting up the club.”</p>
      <p>Reflecting on the findings, Massey said: “It was obviously the wrong combination that evening, which I obviously fully regret. And I’ve got a lot of sympathy with his family.”</p>
      <p>Experts hope the findings can help prevent ­violent crime by identifying people with risk factors.</p>
