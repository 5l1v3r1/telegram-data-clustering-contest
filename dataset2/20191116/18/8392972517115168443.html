      <p>It may not even be December yet but this hasn't stopped people up and down the nation from putting up their <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/food/">Christmas</a> trees and festive decorations.</p>
      <p>And this year an artificial Christmas tree available from Asda is earning glowing reviews... hundreds of them, in fact, from very pleased customers.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://direct.asda.com/george/christmas-shop/trees/6ft-snowy-pine-christmas-tree/050647760,default,pd.html">6ft snowy pine Christmas tree is just £35</a>, which is cheaper than similar products from rival companies. Some comparable trees are going for upwards of £100.</p>
