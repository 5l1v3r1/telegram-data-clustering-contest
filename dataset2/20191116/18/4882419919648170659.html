      <p>Jordi Cruyff has played down the idea of becoming the next Barcelona coach. The son of club legend Johan Cruyff is currently in charge of the Chinese Super League side <b><a href="https://www.sport.es/es/noticias/futbol-internacional/jordi-cruyff-asegura-futuro-superliga-china-7694147">Chongping Dangdai Lifan</a> </b>and can't imagine himself in the Camp Nou hot seat at the moment.</p>
      <p>"There are valid (candidates) in the world of football, there's no reason for (Barça) to be thinking about me," Cruyff said.</p>
      <p>"As a coach, I only have two and a half years of experience. I am trying to learn. I am not thinking about the possibility of coaching Barça."</p>
      <p>Asked if he had any contact with Barça, Cruyff added: "The only contact I have had was to do with the stiff to do with (his dad's) stature and all of that."</p>
      <p>Ronald Koeman has also been toured with the Barça job and Cruyff recently wrote an article praising the Netherlands boss.</p>
      <p>"My comment, in a column, was based on the Dutch national team," he clarified. "He's carried out a generational change. Before there was Van Persie, Huntelaar, Robben... now they have adapted, because there is a lot of defensive talent like Van Dijk, De Ligt, De Jong and more.</p>
      <p>"When (Koeman) took over the national team there was a lot of pessimism and he's managed to lift the mood. And he's been compensated in Holland with a lot of praise.</p>
      <p>"I don't know about the Barça job, though. If I respond to that, it would give footing to the speculation. It's not my issue what Barça have to do, nor am I the right person (to talk about it). I just talk about my own team's problems and respect other coaches."</p>
