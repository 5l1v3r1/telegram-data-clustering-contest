      <p>BLACKSBURG, Va. (AP) — Redshirt freshman Landers Nolley II is making up for lost time.</p>
      <p>Nolley made seven 3-pointers and scored 27 points Saturday, leading Virginia Tech to a 79-53 victory against Lehigh.</p>
      <p>“I’m one of the most impactful freshmen in the country,” he said, adding that being forced to sit out last season allowed him to get better. “I got more knowledgeable, skill. I got in better shape, my mind (got) better. It prepared me for the moments I’m in now.”</p>
      <p>Nolley started slowly, “but in the second half I just started to let it come to me. I just started hitting shots and caught a streak and racked up some quick points.”</p>
      <p>The Hokies’ 4-0 start in their first year under coach Mike Young is their second 4-0 start in as many years. It seemed fitting, too, that they honored former coach Charlie Moir with a moment of silence before the game. Moir, who died Friday, won a school-record 213 games at Tech from 1976-87, and was the coach in 1981 and 1982, the last time Virginia Tech began two seasons in a row by winning their first four games.</p>
      <p>P.J. Horne added 14 points and Hunter Cattoor had 11 for the Hokies. Freshman Tyrece Radford added eight points and 11 rebounds.</p>
      <p>Jeameril Wilson and Jordan Cohen each scored 11 for the Mountain Hawks (2-2). Lehigh trailed just 37-32 at halftime but managed just nine field goals and 21 points after the intermission.</p>
      <p>Virginia Tech led 46-36 and used a 25-6 run to expand its lead to 71-42 with 5:50 remaining.</p>
      <p>“We ended up turning the basketball over, which gave them easy opportunities and run-outs,” Lehigh coach Brett Reed said. “The momentum of the gym and the game just kind of changed with our lack of execution and being sloppy with the ball.”</p>
      <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
      <p>Lehigh: The Mountain Hawks committed 19 turnovers and Virginia Tech turned them into 26 points. Lehigh scored 16 points off the Hokies’ 10 turnovers.</p>
      <p>“They did a very good job of collapsing on the ball,” Reed said. “A lot of times our ball-handler was under duress — led to a lot of turnovers for us. But we also had some unforced turnovers, which ultimately kind of led to them being able to stretch the game.”</p>
      <p>Virginia Tech: The Hokies made a season-high 14 3-pointers and have made at least 10 in three of their four games this season. Nolley was 7 for 12 from beyond the arc and is 15 for 32 for the season.</p>
      <p>UP NEXT</p>
      <p>Lehigh has a quick turnaround, playing Misericordia on Monday night at home.</p>
      <p>The Hokies remain at home and play Delaware State on Wednesday night.</p>
