      <p>The Kolathupalayam Lake located along Karur Bypass Road at Ganapathipalayam village is brimming with water helping in the recharge of groundwater in and around villages in the area.</p>
      <p>The lake, spread across 14 acre, had a capacity to hold three crore litres. It was found in a poor shape as it was not desilted for years. As, water channels to the lake were covered with bushes, the lake received less than one crore litres even during the monsoon.</p>
      <p>As part of its efforts to renovate and restore water bodies in the district, Olirum Erodu Foundation desilted and deepened the water body at ₹ 15 lakh including ₹ 3 lakh as contribution from the local people.</p>
      <p>Work began on August 18, 2018 and was completed on September 20, 2018 after which the water holding capacity of the lake increased from three crore litres to 10.45 crore litres.</p>
      <p>Bunds were strengthened and the pathways cleared of bushes leading to the lake receive copious water last month.</p>
      <p>Villagers said that restoration of lake after many years helped in recharge of groundwater in over 10 villages in the area and added that the importance of the lake could be much felt during dry season as it held more water. “We hope the lake will help recharge farm wells and borewells in April and May,” said P. Murugesan of Ganapathipalayam.</p>
      <p>Officer-bearers of the foundation said that they had so far desilted and deepened 38 water bodies spread across 140 acre in the district leading to increase of water storage capacity to 270 crore litres. “Most of the water bodies are brimming with water due to heavy rain and seepages from Lower Bhavani Project canal,” they added.</p>
