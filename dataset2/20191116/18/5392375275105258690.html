      <p>CoD Mobile: Zombies Mode coming on November 22<br/>4 (80%) 9 votes</p>
      <p>Call of Duty Mobile ( CoD Mobile ) has come a long way in a short period of time and has achieved milestones that most games don’t in their entire lifetime. It currently goes head to head with <a href="http://gizchina.com/tag/pubg">PUBG Mobile</a>, another game published by Tencent Games in the same genre. To maintain player retention, the Call of Duty Mobile team has now confirmed the long-anticipated Zombie Mode arrival date as November 22.</p>

      <p>The CoD Mobile <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayCODMobile">official Twitter handle</a> recently dropped a teaser image showcasing a player shooting at a hoard of zombies. Looking at the teaser, you can perceive the period of the event to be nighttime with a barn building with two floors in the background. Later, the same handle posted another looped teaser video confirming the arrival of Zombie Mode set for November 22 release.</p>

      <p>It is interesting to note that the developers behind CoD Mobile are bringing the Zombie Mode to the game in its second month itself. In context, it took a year for PUBG Mobile to add the same game mode. Another fascinating thing is the Zombie Mode has been part of Call of Duty Mobile since its beta stage but the option was greyed out. Are you ready to for the zombie bloodbath? </p>
