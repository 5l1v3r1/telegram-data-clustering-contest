      <p>I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here is kicking off on Sunday, with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn Jenner</a>, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/nadine-coyle/">Nadine Coyle</a> and Jacqueline Jossa among the famous faces taking part.</p>
      <p>But, while we’re all dying to watch Ian Wright take on an eating challenge – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/im-a-celebrity-bosses-confirm-live-bugs-wont-be-eaten-in-bush-tucker-trials-11168266/">but not one with live critters because they have been banned</a> – Amanda Holden just wants to see Kate Garraway in her bikini…</p>
      <p>The Good Morning Britain star is on this year’s line-up, and her pal has given her some (sort of) solid words of encouragement for life in the jungle.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/celebrity/article-7692871/Amanda-Holden-tells-Kate-Garraway-whack-bikini-Im-Celebrity-Here.html">In a video obtained by MailOnline</a>, the 48-year-old can be seen telling the camera: ‘Whack on a bikini, because she’s got a decent pair of…’</p>
      <p>Gesturing to her own chest, she joked: ‘We all want that waterfall shot.’</p>
      <p>When asked how Kate, 52, will handle being in Australia, she joked: ‘I think she’ll deal with the creepy crawlies and the snakes very well because she works with Piers Morgan every day.’</p>

      <p>Piers revealed that the ITV star actually called him to ask for his advice ahead of her stint, and that he actually encouraged her to do it.</p>
      <p>During an appearance on Good Morning Britain, he also claimed <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/kate-garraway-almost-pulled-out-of-im-a-celebrity-just-weeks-ahead-of-show-11088279/">she was ‘in two minds’ about whether or not to take part</a>.</p>
      <p>‘Kate rang me three weeks ago when she first got approached and I said she should absolutely do it,’ he said.</p>
      <p>‘People will love her, she will be hardworking.</p>
      <p>‘She was genuinely in two minds because if you get bounced out straight away it can be quite humiliating.’</p>

      <p>We think she’ll smash it.</p>
      <p>But there has been a huge change-up to jungle life this year, as ITV bosses confirmed that no live bugs will be eaten in Bush Tucker trials from now on.</p>
      <p>After a lot of backlash, producers have switched things up and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/im-a-celebrity-bosses-ban-live-insects-from-bushtucker-trials-after-animal-rights-backlash-11165998/">implemented a change ‘fully and permanently’</a>.</p>
      <p>A rep for I’m A Celeb told Metro.co.uk: ‘No live critters will be eaten in the Bush Tucker trials this year. Producers have taken a look at the trials and decided that no live critters would be eaten this year.</p>

      <p>‘They have been planning this for some time and actually last year beach worms were the only critters eaten live but this time around they’ve decided to implement the change fully and permanently.’</p>
