      <h1>Gujarat Confidential: Data Status</h1>
      <h2>A press note from the state government mentioning a “35% decline in dengue cases”, came without the mention of the base number or period of comparison.</h2>

      <p>State health department officials appear to be embarrassed by the high number of cases of dengue being reported in Gujarat and seem to have resorted to comparing weekly percentage change to soften the blow. A press note from the state government mentioning a “35% decline in dengue cases”, came without the mention of the base number or period of comparison. The department remains hesitant to share exact numbers, saying, “When we give numbers, it goes as headline without a context and it looks very bad for our department and goes on to lower our morale…Anyway weekly comparison is the appropriate way to assess if the control measures that we are taking, is effective or not.”</p>
