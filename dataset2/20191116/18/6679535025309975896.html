      <p>‘Arisi Raja’, the wild elephant nicknamed for its habit of stealing rice from houses and shops, is now getting steamed rice, but in captivity at the kraal (wooden enclosure) of the Forest Department at Varagaliar, near Topslip.</p>
      <p>The tusker is given rice and ragi apart from natural fodder available in the forest, according to forest officials.</p>
      <p>“It has started accepting the food given to camp elephants of the Forest Department. The elephant is under the care of forest veterinary officers, who take turns in monitoring the animal,” A.S. Marimuthu, Deputy Field Director of Anamalai Tiger Reserve (ATR), told <i>The Hindu</i>.</p>
      <p>The diet chart of the captive elephant include boiled rice, ragi, jaggery, sugarcane, coconut, fruits and plenty of forest fodder. Salt and other supplements are also part of the diet of the elephant.</p>
      <p>Mr. Marimuthu said that the elephant was calm at night, the time it used to be active before being captured.</p>
      <p>It had the habit of raiding houses for soft foods like rice, apart from feeding on agricultural produces at night.</p>
      <p>A mahout and a ‘kavadi’ have been tasked to train the elephant. In captivity, the elephant will be taught 48 basic commands and their combinations. “The commands are a mix of Urdu, Tamil and a bit of other languages that are commonly used by mahouts,” said Mr. Marimuthu.</p>
      <p>Aged around 20, the elephant was tranquillised and captured by the department from Arthanaripalayam, near Pollachi, on Thursday. The department decided to keep the elephant in captivity after an expert opinion as efforts to rehabilitate it into the forest would not yield results.</p>
      <p>The elephant had killed three persons and caused damages to farms and houses in places near Aliyar. It was also habituated to people.</p>
      <p>The kraal housing ‘Arisi Raja’ was earlier occupied by Chinna Thambi, another wild elephant captured by the department after it ventured into crop-raiding even after it was translocated from Thadagam of Coimbatore Forest Division to ATR. Training for Chinna Thambi is over, according to the officials.</p>
