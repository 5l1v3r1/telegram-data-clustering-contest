      <p>ADDIS ABABA/CHICAGO: The last remains of 157 people <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/ethiopian-airlines-memorial-crash-site-addis-ababa-11880930">killed aboard an Ethiopian Airlines plane</a> in March were interred at the crash site this week, farmers and families told Reuters, but some relatives were upset they had been unable to take part in the ceremony.</p>
      <p>Nadia Milleron, whose daughter Samya Stumo was killed, said an email was sent to some families - but not all - notifying them of the burial just two days before it happened.</p>

      <p>"By the time the burial took place I was just wiped out; I was just glad they were doing it. I was tired of it not being done," said Milleron. "But a lot of people didn't feel like that. They hadn't been aware of what was happening."</p>
      <p>Ethiopian Airlines did not return calls seeking comment about why some families were not told in advance.</p>
      <p>Families have been begging the airline to fill in the crater left by the Mar 10 crash, which still contained remains too small to be recovered.</p>

      <p>Milleron said on Saturday that locals had been burying remains exposed by rains in small mounds of earth. She herself found a bone at the site when she visited Ethiopia to collect her daughter's remains in October, which she told the airline about in an email.</p>
      <p>The force of the impact meant no complete bodies were recovered; partial remains were tested for DNA and finally returned to families last month.</p>
      <p>As the burial took place on Thursday, a US embassy representative present kept Milleron updated by text: "Now they're laying the coffins down, now they're putting earth on them ..."</p>
      <p>"I became a blubbering mess," she said.</p>
      <p>Milleron said the lack of notice of the burial ceremony had raised tensions between the families and Ethiopian Airlines.</p>
      <p>Representatives of the airline and of Boeing and some embassy employees were there. The Boeing representatives were on a prearranged trip to discuss community projects, Milleron said.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/737-max-boeing-ceo-dennis-muilenburg-we-made-mistakes-congress-12041848">Boeing manufactured the 737 MAX 8 plane</a>, which nosedived shortly after take-off. A preliminary investigation pointed to a malfunctioning anti-stall system known as MCAS, which was also implicated in the crash of a Lion Air plane in Indonesia five months earlier. All 189 people onboard that flight were killed.</p>
      <p>Tesfaye Mulatu, a farmer near the crash site, said he had seen a helicopter arrive and cars bring caskets on Thursday. The crater left by the impact has been filled in, he said.</p>
      <p>"Now, the area looks a football field," he told Reuters by telephone.</p>
      <p>Some bereaved families have formed associations and hope to use funds from Boeing to build a memorial. The manufacturer will make US$100 million available, with half going to families and half to projects in local communities.</p>
      <p>"We continue to offer our deepest sympathies to the families and loved ones of the victims of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 and <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lion-air-crash-indonesia-family-pray-victims-12043822">Lion Air Flight 610</a> and we are committed to helping those affected by these tragedies," Boeing spokesman Chaz Bickers said. </p>
