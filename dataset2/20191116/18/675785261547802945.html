      <h1>Malta coach 'knocks himself out' in dugout during Spain clash and forgets second half</h1>
      <h2>Ray Farrugia banged his head on the dugout during Malta's Euro 2020 qualifier with Spain on Friday and had to receive medical attention on the bench</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T18:16:01+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 18:16</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p>Malta coach Ray Farrugia admitted he doesn't remember the last 20 minutes of his sides defeat to Spain, after knocking himself out in the dugout.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/spain-football-team">Spain</a> were already cruising their way to victory when Farrugia came into contact with the structure of the dugout in the 64th minute, wounding his head.</p>
      <p>He was seen to by medical staff, who treated the cut with a plaster, and gave the 64-year-old ice to place on the back of his head and neck.</p>
      <p>Farrugia then spent the remainder of the match sat on the bench staring at the floor, seemingly still in a daze from his mild concussion.</p>
      <p>Speaking in a press conference after the match, he said: "Of the last 20 minutes, I don't remember hardly anything."</p>

      <p>It was perhaps not the worst thing that Farrugia cannot recall some of the games action, considering his side shipped seven goals in the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/euro-2020">Euro 2020</a> qualifier in Cadiz on Friday.</p>
      <p>All of Spain's strikes were scored by different players, with former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> striker Alvaro Morata opening the scoring.</p>
      <p>Santi Cazorla added another before half-time, before Pau Torres and Pablo Sarabia notched prior to Farrugia's accident.</p>
      <p>Whilst the Malta boss was being tended to, Dani Olmo added a fifth, with Gerard Moreno and Jesus Navas wrapping up the scoring.</p>

      <p>Farrugia added: "We played against the best team in the world, I have no doubt about that.</p>
      <p>"On top of that we conceded four goals from corner kicks. Spain are better than us, undoubtedly, and I think that with those players they can win the European Championship. And I watch a lot of football."</p>
      <p>Spain and Sweden have already qualified for next summer's tournament in first and second in Group F respectively.</p>
      <p>Malta are currently joint-bottom with the Faroe Islands, but can salvage some pride if they are able to better their result in the final group match.</p>
      <p>Farrugia's men face Norway at home, while the Faroe Islands travel to Sweden, with both fixtures due to be played on Monday.</p>
