      <h1>BREAKING Labour general election manifesto agreed 'unanimously' after six-hour party meeting</h1>
      <h2>Jeremy Corbyn claimed there was unanimous agreement on the document despite a lengthy meeting and splits beforehand on key issues - including freedom of movement after Brexit</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T18:27:22+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 18:27</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Bloom, https://www.facebook.com/mirrordanbloom</a></address>
      <p>Labour's general election manifesto was signed off "unanimously" tonight after a meeting of party chiefs lasting more than six hours.</p>
      <p>The "transformative" document is set to promise nationalised mail, rail, water, energy and broadband, free NHS prescriptions and six years' free adult education in England, and a £10 minimum wage for all over 16.</p>
      <p>But unions and some of Labour's front bench were split before the Clause V meeting over key issues - including immigration.</p>
      <p>Moments after the meeting tonight it was still unclear what agreement had been reached on freedom of movement after <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> .</p>
      <p>A row had also been raging over the exact terms of Labour's Green New Deal, union sources said.</p>
      <p>The full manifesto will only be published on Thursday at its launch after being leaked in full to the Mirror in 2017.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> said as the meeting ended: “We’ve just had a very extensive meeting of our party’s national executive, Shadow Cabinet and other people as well.</p>
      <p>“And we’ve reached unanimous agreement on the contents of our manifesto which will be published next week.</p>
      <p>“That manifesto is a transformative document that will change the lives of the people of this country for the better.</p>
      <p>“It will be a once-in a generation opportunity to vote for a more egalitarian society that cares for all and I’m very proud of the contents of it and I can’t wait to take those contents and it’s promise of a better Britain to everyone all around this country during our election campaign.”</p>
