      <p>Discerning guests do know the best place to stay on the island paradise in Aklan. </p>
      <p>But one particularly very important guest was spotted at Mövenpick, specifically on the beachfront. It was an Olive Ridley Turtle, which on Nov. 5 was seen nesting with approximately 106 eggs. </p>
      <p>As with all guests of the resort, general manager Andre Brulhart is leading the team in making sure the VIP guest and its eggs are well taken care of. In coordination with municipal marine biologist Haron Deo Vargas, necessary procedures have been undertaken to ensure the security of the fragile eggs, including the building of a fence to protect the nest.</p>
      <p>“We are very delighted and we are filled with excitement as we anticipate the hatching of the eggs. We see this as a sign of environmental sustainability and a sign of hope. Mövenpick Resort and Spa Boracay is deeply committed to the environment in as much as we are committed to our guests,” enthused Brulhart.</p>
      <p>Vargas revealed it was the first time he has encountered an Olive Ridley Turtle in the island’s reefs.  The most common, he said, were Hawksbill and Green Sea Turtles, and sometimes Leatherback Turtle.  </p>
      <p>“We have four species of sea turtles in our municipal waters, out of five species that can be found in the Philippines,” he shared. </p>
      <p>Olive Ridley Turtle is the most abundant sea turtle species in the world and is known for its mass nesting. It is also one of the smallest sea turtle species at only 2- to 2.5-feet (0.6 to 0.7 meters) long and 80 to 110 pounds (36 to 50 kg.). They are named after the olive coloration of their heart-shaped shells.</p>

      <p>Vargas said the eggs will hatch anytime from 45 to 75 days. He also added that the resort can expect more. “That is just one clutch. A nester can have up to seven clutches, and it takes a week or more for a female Olive Ridley Turtle to nest.”</p>
      <p>Mövenpick Resort and Spa Boracay security, meantime, is placed on alert for the return of the mother turtle. It is also updating the community through its social media accounts.</p>
