      <p>Over 200 physical education teachers from different schools staged a protest here raising various demands on the inaugural day of Kerala State Athletic Championship, on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The teachers have been protesting for the past six months, demanding equal salary, exclusion from special category and increasing posts in schools.</p>
      <p>V. Vijayan, who is a State committee member of the Department of Physical Education and chairman of the Kannur District Samara Samithi, said the government had not fulfilled their long-pending demands. He said their primary demand was that physical education teachers should be given equal pay as that of high school teachers.</p>
      <p>They were now considered under special category and were paid less than that of general category teachers, he said.</p>
      <p>While a basic pay of over ₹25,740 was paid to physical education teachers in higher secondary schools, the general category teachers were paid ₹34,500, he said. “We want to be excluded from the special category and brought under the general category,” he said.</p>
      <p>In the absence of physical education teachers in many upper primary schools and high schools, classes were taken by HSS teachers for which they were paid just ₹300 per month, said Mr. Vijayan. At present, there was only one teacher for 500 students, which should be changed to one teacher for 200 students, he said.</p>
      <p>For the 5,600-odd public schools in the State, there were just over 1,900 teachers, he claimed, and added that equal importance should be given to sports and other subjects.</p>
