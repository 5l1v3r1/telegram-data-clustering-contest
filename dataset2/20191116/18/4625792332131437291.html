      <p>A Border Patrol agent shot and wounded a Russian man suspected of crossing the border illegally into Arizona, the agency said Friday.</p>
      <p>The agent tried to arrest the man Thursday near the Arizona border with Mexico, and a physical altercation ensued, <a href="https://ktar.com/story/2844353/border-patrol-agent-shoots-russian-man-near-arizona-mexico-border/">according to the agency</a>. The agent shot the man, who was flown to a Phoenix hospital and is expected to survive. The Border Patrol agent was not seriously injured.</p>
      <p>"As the agent attempted to arrest the subject, a physical altercation ensued, and the agent discharged his firearm, striking the subject," U.S. Customs and Border Patrol <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/border-patrol-agent-shoots-russian-allegedly-trying-to-sneak-into-us">said</a>.</p>
      <p>The FBI is joining CBP's Use of Force Incident Team in investigating the shooting.</p>
      <p>An agency spokesman did not immediately return a request for comment from the <i>Washington Examiner.</i></p>
