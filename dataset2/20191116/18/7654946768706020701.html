      <h1>The sensational debut and fall of the world’s first ‘celebutante’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T18:35:57+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 18:35</time> by <a rel="author">Raquel Laneri</a></address>
      <p>Brenda Frazier was ready for her close-up. The 17-year-old had squeezed into her ball gown, brushed her dark hair into a glossy wave and applied a perfect crimson pout onto her lips. It was December 1938, the height of the debutante season, and much of New York society had already been out for hours, watching other rich girls make their “debuts.” But Frazier — already dubbed the “deb of the decade” by the press — knew they wouldn’t skip her coming-out party.</p>
      <p>At 11:24 p.m., Frazier — in white satin with cascading ostrich feathers and carrying a bouquet of orchids — arrived at the Ritz-Carlton ballroom, her bejeweled mother, the embarrassingly nouveau riche Brenda Watriss, at her side. Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt was there, carrying her famous fox fur, as was Vogue publisher Condé Nast. Some 2,000 guests, as well as some crashers, danced the rumba, downed champagne (1,000 quarts of it) and rode “crazy cars” around the hotel’s ballroom well into the morning.</p>
      <p>Frazier had a cold and spent the evening sipping milk mixed with Coca-Cola, but she still mustered the energy to dance, flirt with a bevy of suitors and canoodle with the rakish (and much older) New Yorker cartoonist Peter Arno. At 6:30 a.m., her pal Douglas Fairbanks Jr. draped a white tablecloth over a shivering Frazier’s exposed shoulders as she said goodnight to the last of the revelers.</p>
      <p>The next day, the papers breathlessly reported on the No. 1 glamour girl’s debut. The San Francisco Chronicle, all the way across the country, proclaimed: “BRENDA IS FINALLY OUT, NOW WE CAN ALL RELAX.”</p>
      <p>“Before Brenda, you really only had one kind of debutante, who was upper class or aspiring upper class . . . who either was in society or wanted to enter it,” said Kristen Richardson, author of “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Season-Social-History-Debutante-ebook/dp/B07P9BMXQP/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=The+Season%3A+A+Social+History+of+the+Debutante&amp;qid=1573858040&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1&amp;tag=nypost-20">The Season: A Social History of the Debutante</a>” (W. W. Norton), out Tuesday.</p>

      <p>Frazier was different. She was rich, yes, but she was considered an interloper. And her family used her coming-out not just to cement her status but as a springboard to real celebrity. Frazier’s ubiquity, her hustle, her fame inspired the gossip columnist Walter Winchell to coin the term “celebutante,” specifically for her.</p>
      <p>“She became like the Kim Kardashian or Paris Hilton of her time,” Richardson told The Post. “She was their forerunner, for sure.”</p>
      <p>Formally named Brenda Diana Duff Frazier, she was born in Quebec in 1921. While her grandparents had money and some status, Frazier’s parents didn’t. Her father, Frank Frazier, came from a prosperous Boston family but went on a drunken bender after little Brenda was born, disappearing for months. Big Brenda — whose Montreal banker father had been knighted by King George V — was morally bankrupt, a trait she inherited from her own mother, who had socialized with Adolf Hitler and had a self-portrait painted by him.</p>

      <p>“I’m afraid it made very little difference to my grandmother whether a man was a beast or a hero, as long as he was head of state,” Frazier later wrote in an article for Life magazine.</p>
      <p>Frazier’s parents divorced when she was 4 or 5, but the contentious custody battle lasted for nearly eight years. That was when the press first became interested in Brenda Frazier, a little girl with a $4 million trust fund — awarded to her by her paternal grandfather — and vulgar parents. By the time her mother got custody of her, little Brenda was well on her way to becoming a celebrity.</p>
      <p>“There was a bit of that stage-mom energy in Brenda’s mom,” said Richardson. “She didn’t get to have what Brenda had” — beauty, an entree into the creme of society — “and she wanted it. And she could use Brenda’s trust to do it.”</p>
      <p>As soon as Frazier was 12, Big Brenda began dressing her in furs and heavy makeup — and telling her she was fat and had to go on a diet (she was perfectly healthy). By 13, Frazier would stay out all night waltzing at the St. Regis, at her mother’s urging. When she was 14, she was presented at court in England in a low-cut white dress that was far too mature for her.</p>
      <p>“Brenda smoked, she drank, and this is all as an early teen,” said Richardson. “You had a Drew Barrymore kind of situation, where no one was minding the shop.”</p>
      <p>Brenda Sr. wanted more than just fame for her daughter. She wanted prestige. And the way to get it was to enter New York society with a fabulous debut.</p>
      <p>It wasn’t that easy. Even though Frazier went to upper-crust schools like Chapin and Miss Porter’s, mother and daughter found most of society’s doors closed to them. Her constant appearance in the tabloids was seen as crass. And when the paparazzi snapped a photo of her dunking her donut in a cup of coffee, it caused a scandal, with even Emily Post asking whether Frazier’s technique was vulgar or classy.</p>
      <p>By the time Frazier was ready to make her debut, most of the established charity group balls and cotillions — even the more down-market ones — rejected her application.</p>

        <figcaption>Among the many who became enamored of the pretty brunette Frazier were high-flying tycoon Howard Hughes, football star John “Shipwreck” Kelly, whom she married and New Yorker cartoonist Peter Arno.</figcaption>

      <p>“Brenda was not an Astor, she was not from old New York and everyone thought she was super flashy,” said Richardson of Frazier. “Nobody wanted their kids to go anywhere near her — but of course they did because the parties [she attended] were going to be more fun than the debutante parties that they would all be having.”</p>
      <p>So Brenda Sr. decided she would just throw her daughter the biggest, splashiest solo debut herself. She settled on gilded decorations that evoked Versailles, booked extra rooms at the Ritz for guests who needed a nap, and settled on a very late start time so as not to compete with any of the other balls that evening. (Oddly, the press wasn’t invited as was custom for the time, so almost no photos exist from the event.)</p>
      <p>“She had everything planned,” said Richardson. “The time was a stroke of genius, because people would go to some other debut beforehand and then say, ‘Oh, I’m kind of wasted — I’m going to go to Brenda’s; that seems really fun.’ ”</p>

      <p>There was just one problem. While Brenda Sr. was in the midst of her scheming, her daughter was completing her mandatory “finishing” year abroad in Europe — in Munich — and she didn’t want to come back. During the days she studied French and German at a small school, and in the evenings she attended classical-music concerts. She’d had a taste of the mundane life, and she liked it.</p>
      <p>“It was such a leisurely place, with no pressures, no social whirl,” Frazier later wrote about that time. “People there went to the opera not because they wanted to be seen . . . but because they loved the music . . . When I returned to America I begged my mother to forget about my debut, to go on living and studying in Germany.”</p>
      <p>Big Brenda was aghast. She looked at her daughter and said, “Brenda, you’ll be very sorry if you don’t have your debut. You’ll be much happier if you do.”</p>
      <p>That was, as Frazier later put it, the end of her rebellion.</p>

      <p>The morning after her debut, Frazier woke up feeling lousy, with swollen feet and a sore shoulder, but she was on top of the world. Suddenly famous, an offer came in from Hollywood, though the wooden celebutante bombed her screen test and nothing came of that. Still, she got gigs posing for racy advertisements for soaps and perfumes.</p>
      <p>“The idea was that she would appear like she was a working woman,” said Richardson. “She was a kind of proto-influencer, where she was famous for being famous and then it kind of snowballed into something else.”</p>
      <p>All this “work” didn’t do much to endear her to the Astors and their ilk, but it gained her other admirers — including Howard Hughes, who became enamored of her image in a car advertisement and arranged a way to meet her. The two had an affair and, Frazier said, he proposed but she turned him down.</p>
      <p>One gossipy (and highly contested) Hughes biography claims Frazier had another wooer: the actress Joan Crawford, whom she was often spotted with at the Stork Club. The actress allegedly sent perfumes and flowers to the celebutante, but Frazier eventually rebuffed her. (The tawdry tome also says that Crawford later referred to Frazier as “the debutramp.”)</p>

      <p>Finally, Frazier married insurance banker and former football star John “Shipwreck” Kelly in 1941. Though she said she was “fond” of him, she wasn’t fond of the Long Island farmhouse where they lived — miles from the Stork Club and the Ritz. There was no more champagne, no more parties, no more modeling. “I was miserable,” she wrote.</p>
      <p>The pair had a daughter, Victoria, in 1945 and divorced in 1956. Her next marriage was to an aviator and even shorter. In 1963, she penned a memoir for Life magazine calling her debut a “horror” and saying that being a debutante ruined her life.</p>
      <p>She spent much of her last two decades addicted to drugs and alcohol, languishing away in her homes in Beacon Hill and Cape Cod. Her arm bared slashes from her 30 suicide attempts. Emaciated, but still convinced she was fat, she refused to eat and would even take her feeding tubes out if she couldn’t wrap her index finger and thumb around her upper arm. She once quipped that she “invented” anorexia.</p>
      <p>She finally died in 1982 of bone cancer, at the age of 60.</p>
      <p>As for whether being a deb really did destroy her life, Richardson said there is some truth to that.</p>
      <p>“She was just a child, and she felt like she didn’t get to choose her own life,” Richardson said. “The way her mother chose to have her debut: that became her identity. She didn’t have the option of trying to be something else.”</p>
