      <h1>Take Me Out contestant lifts lid on what it's really like to be on the show</h1>
      <h2>Author Meera Sharma opened up about her experience</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T18:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/sophie-mccoid/" target="_blank">Sophie McCoid</a></address>
      <p>A Take Me Out contestant has lifted the lid on what really goes on behind the scenes of the hit TV show.</p>
      <p>Meera Sharma, 31, is currently appearing on this series of the ITV dating show fronted by<a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/showbiz-news/paddy-mcguinness-hits-back-ignorant-17193698"> Paddy McGuinness </a>on Saturday nights.</p>
      <p>The Ormskirk native impressed fans in the first episode when she dissed Peter Andre's classic hit 'Mysterious Girl.'</p>
      <p>And while author Meera remained tight lipped about the casting process and whether she actually bags a date on the show, she did let slip some <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/secrets-behind-your-favourite-reality-15570508">behind the scenes gossip.</a></p>

      <p>Meera, who hoped to bag herself a Michael B Jordan lookalike on the show, said: "It was a brilliant, fun experience and I'd definitely do it again - but it could be very tiring filming for hours.</p>
      <p>"It was filmed a year ago, so it's funny watching it back, because you're just running on adrenaline, I can't remember half of the things I've said.</p>
      <p>"We were encouraged to bring our own wardrobe to show off our personality and I really liked that, because I have a distinctive style.</p>
      <p>"I really wanted to show off my character and wear bright colours every week.</p>

      <p>"We get our own glam squad on the show, who do your hair and make-up every week and that's great."</p>
      <p>But Meera said the days could be tiring, with contestants expected to be at the studio from early morning until the evening.</p>
      <p>Meera said: "We'd get there early in the morning and then go to hair and make-up before we did a rehearsal, just to check everything looked right on the cameras and the girls were in the correct position.</p>
      <p>"Then we'd just film the episode in one go with a live audience in the early evening.</p>
      <p>"It was really fun, but it was a long day and you could get tired, you're on your feet for a long time and you're on call all day, going in to get your make-up retouched or your hair checked.</p>

      <p>"But it was really nice chatting to the girls and we all got on really well."</p>
      <p>Meera said she was worried the other contestants would be "catty" but when she met the other girls she said they all bonded and still speak to each other now.</p>
      <p>She said: "I met so many lovely girls, we all got on really well.</p>
      <p>"I think sometimes when girls get together they can be a bit catty, but everyone was really lovely.</p>
      <p>"That's the thing, even if you don't get a date you meet so many new friends, so it's worth going on just for that.</p>
      <p>"We're all still in touch via social media and we meet up for drinks when we're in the same part of the country.</p>
      <p>"With the show airing now we're all messaging each other every week about something hilarious we'd forgotten we'd said.</p>

      <p>"And <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/showbiz-news/inside-paddy-mcguinness-insane-workouts-16729688">Paddy is just as nice </a>as he appears on TV, he's so witty and funny and really bounces off us."</p>
      <p>Since the show was filmed Meera has kept herself busy, launching a motivational platform for women and writing 'The little book of sass' featuring inspirational quotes to motivate women.</p>
