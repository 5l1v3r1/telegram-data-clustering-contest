      <p>DES MOINES, Iowa â€” Three tissues donors were honored Saturday afternoon with a gift their families will never forget. Even though they have passed on their memories live on forever.</p>
      <p>One of the people honored was former Ottumwa resident Kayte Mosher.</p>
      <blockquote>"My daughter Brittney was honored on the float in 2013. So i am familiar with the process of having a daughter honored on the float. I just want the parents of Kayte and the family to enjoy this moment, "said Raquel and Gabriel Gonzalez."</blockquote>
      <p>Kayte's sister Heather and family were more than happy to see their sisters memory continuing to be honored, and the fact that her legacy will live on forever is heartwarming to say the least.</p>
      <blockquote>"Kayte gave 278 bone graphs, 45 skin graphs, two heart valves, and two corneas. So she saved or helped hundreds of people all across the country even as far away as Singapore. So when i found out earlier this year that Kayte was going to be honored with a floragraph, I immediately just burst into tears it means so much to me. It makes me so proud and I feel so honored that Kayte is still remembered, and that her legacy continues to inspire other people to become donors,"said Heather Butterfield.</blockquote>
      <p>Saturday was the first time Kaytes's family has seen the floragraph, and they were more than pleased.</p>
      <blockquote>"I didn't really know what to expect what it would look like,and as soon as I saw it, it made me smile. Because of kayte's smile. She always had such a big smile on her face,and I love that they captured that,and i feel like her light,her personality really shines through the floragraph. When i look at it it makes me very happy,and makes me really proud,"said Heather.</blockquote>
      <p>If you would like to become a donor there are multiple options. When you get your license at the DMV you can sign up. When you get your hunting or fishing license you can sign up as well, or you can go to <a href="https://www.iowadonornetwork.org/">Iowa Donor Network</a>.</p>
