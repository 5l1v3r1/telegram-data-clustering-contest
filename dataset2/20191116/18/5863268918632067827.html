      <p>LAHORE (Dunya News) – Attorney General Anwar Masood Khan on Saturday said Lahore High Court (LHC) has given an interim order on an appeal seeking removal of former premier Nawaz Sharif’s name from ECL. He said this is not a final verdict but government will act on the orders issued by the court.</p>
      <p>Talking exclusively to Dunya News, he said this is a crucial verdict as LHC has only announced an interim order and court will resume hearing on the matter in January.</p>
      <p>He further said the detailed discussion on the matter would be held in January. He said federal cabinet would take final decision in this regard.</p>
      <p>On the other hand Additional Attorney General Ishtiaq Ahmed Khan said further hearing on the matter would resume in third week of January where legal points would be discussed.</p>
      <p>He said the draft prepared by the LHC mentioned that government would keep checking health of Nawaz Sharif through foreign embassy.</p>
      <p>He said the government would again knock the doors of court if Nawaz Sharif did not return to the country despite good health.</p>
