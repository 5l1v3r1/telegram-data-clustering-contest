      <p><u>UNREST</u>    <u>UGANDA</u><br/><br/><b>Assailants in DR Congo have killed 14 civilians in revenge for army offensives against Ugandan rebel strongholds in the east of the country, a local official said on Saturday.</b><br/><br/>The latest killings, which occurred in the night from Friday to Saturday, take the total number of those killed in revenge attacks in the past two weeks to more than 30.<br/><br/>The attacks took place in two locations in the Beni region of the North Kivu province where the Congolese army last month announced an offensive to root out insurgents belonging to the Islamist-inspired rebel group the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) -- a militia of Ugandan origin that has long operated in the border region.<br/><br/>Beni administrator Donat Kibwana said the attackers used machetes and knives, and were believed to have gone on to loot shops and homes.<br/><br/>The army said on October 30 it had launched "large-scale operations", including shelling and troop deployments, aimed at ridding the area of armed groups. <br/><br/>But the civilian death toll in ADF attacks has been rising, and residents have accused the army of focusing their efforts on the wrong areas. <br/><br/>"It's a complicated situation because the population is the target of ADF revenge attacks against army operations," said Teddy Kataliko, president of the Beni Civil Society.<br/><br/>The ADF, which has been present in Democratic Republic of Congo since 1995, is accused of having killed hundreds or even thousands of civilians in the Beni region in the past five years.<br/><br/>The Islamic State jihadist group has claimed some of the ADF's recent attacks but there is no clear evidence of any affiliation between them. </p>
