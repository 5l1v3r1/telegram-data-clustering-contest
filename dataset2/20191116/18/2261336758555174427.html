      <h1>Israel Adesanya hails Demetrious Johnson ‘the best fighter in the world’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T18:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Mckeever</a></address>
      <p>Demetrious Johnson might no longer compete in the UFC, but the former flyweight king is still considered the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world by his contemporaries.</p>
      <p>Johnson, who defended his UFC flyweight title a record breaking eleven times, left the UFC to sign with ONE Championship in 2018 and has gone on to capture the promotion’s flyweight title.</p>
      <p>Johnson’s lone title defeat in the UFC came to Henry ‘Triple C’ Cejudo, who beat ‘Mighty Mouse’ via split decision in the UFC 227 co-main event. Cejudo has since gone on to capture the UFC bantamweight title, becoming the promotion’s first ever simultaneous flyweight and bantamweight champion.</p>
      <p>Although Johnson never gained a mass following in the UFC, newly-minted UFC middleweight champ Israel Adesanya believes ‘DJ’ was the best fighter in the promotion and current pound-for-pound #1.</p>
      <p>“The best fighter in the world right now? Demetrious ‘Mighty Mouse’ Johnson,” Adesanya said on a recent edition of Ebro in the Morning, per <a href="https://thebodylockmma.com/ufc/israel-adesanya-rates-demetrious-johnson-as-pound-for-pound-best-fighter/">Abhinav Kini of The Body Lock MMA</a>. “Unfortunately, he’s not in the UFC anymore but I don’t think he has anything to prove in the UFC.</p>
      <p>“The guy, the way he operates at that weight class. He’s just so… [snaps fingers],” Adesanya added. “It’s just different. Some of the shit he did, like when he caught the guy with a suplex flying armbar. That was nuts. Who does that?”</p>
      <p>Johnson has gone on a three-fight tear since signing with ONE FC last year and the MMA veteran will look to defend his newly-acquired flyweight title in the new year.</p>
