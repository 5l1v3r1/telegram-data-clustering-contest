      <p>G. Jagadeesha, Deputy Commissioner, said on Saturday that some libraries were fast becoming memorials owing to a decline in reading habit among people.</p>
      <p>He was speaking after inaugurating the National Librarary Week organised by the Department of Public Libraries, here.</p>
      <p>Mr. Jagadeesha said that if libraries joined the list of memorials, it only showed the moral decline in a society. To become a good writer or public speaker, it was necessary to have knowledge of various subjects. The social media only gave half-baked information.</p>
      <p>Instead of depending on social media, students should cultivate the habit of reading newspapers, magazines and good books. Instead of wasting their time on social media, the youth should develop the habit of spending more time in libraries, he said.</p>
      <p>K. Raghupati Bhat, MLA, said that libraries were like neglected departments of the government. They should be given importance. This required not just the support of the government, but also the people.</p>
      <p>Those who read books have good knowledge. Hence it was necessary to inculcate the habit of reading good books among children. Efforts were on to digitise public libraries in the district. The construction of new libraries too was on in the district, he said.</p>
      <p>Dinakar Babu, president of Zilla Panchayat, said that in order to improve and increase reading habits among people, the libraries should change their timings and be open for more time.</p>
      <p>If the libraries were kept open during holidays, they would be of more benefit to students. People should start visiting libraries often and read the dailies, periodicals and books, he said.</p>
      <p>Kokkarne Surendranath Shetty, Head, Department of Political Science, MGM College, delivered a lecture on the importance of digital libraries. Nalini G.I., chief librarian, District Central Library, welcomed the gathering.</p>
