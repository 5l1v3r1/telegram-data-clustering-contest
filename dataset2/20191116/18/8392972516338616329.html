      <h1>Strictly fans gets an eyeful as Kelvin Fletcher poses in his pants for spray tan</h1>
      <h2>Ex Emmerdale star loves to feel the glow</h2>

      <p>Kelvin Fletcher will no doubt send <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/strictly-come-dancing/">Strictly Come Dancing</a> fans into a spin with this cheeky pre-spray tan snap.</p>
      <p>Every week the former <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/">Emmerdale</a> star gets a tan ready for the live show on Saturday. However, fans have never had a backstage photo - until now.</p>
      <p>Taking to his Instagram Stories, the actor posted a shot of himself wearing nothing more than a pair of pants as he poses in front of the spray tan tent.</p>

      <p>"I mean it's not really a Friday if you don't step into the tanning booth," he wrote alongside the photo.</p>
      <p>Kelvin has talked about his weekly tan, but has never shared a flesh-baring behind-the-scenes pic like this.</p>
      <p>Last month he even admitted he can't wait to get a fresh glow and said it instantly makes him look better.</p>
      <p>"Spray tan always takes me from a 7/10 to an 8/10," he wrote on Instagram.</p>
      <p>"Is it really weird that I look forward to the Friday spray tan session?!"</p>

      <p>Kelvin is currently in Blackpool with the other six remaining contestants as he prepares to dance the Jive to Jailhouse Rock from Smokey Joe's Café.</p>
      <p>Last week, Kelvin and partner Oti Mabuse performed an energetic salsa and won high praise from the <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/strictly-come-dancing/">Strictly</a> judges.</p>
      <p>However, fans at home thought they should have received higher scores after Craig Revel Horwood awarded them an eight, while Motsi Mabuse, Shirley Ballas and Bruno Tonioli each gave them a nine.</p>
      <p>"I'm sorry but why is Kelvin not getting 10s for that please explain #Strictly," one fan wrote, while a second outraged viewer tweeted, "An EIGHT?! For Kelvin’s performance??? Are you joking?? #Strictly."</p>
