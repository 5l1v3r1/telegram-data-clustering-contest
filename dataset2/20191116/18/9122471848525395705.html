      <h1>Odell Beckham Jr. Calls Out The NFL Over His Drug Tests</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T18:02:55+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 18:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>Myles Garrett and Mason Rudolph stole all the headlines on Thursday night because of their brawl. Lost in all the madness was the fact that Odell Beckham Jr. called out the NFL once again.</p>
      <p>Beckham has stated multiple times this season that he believes the league is targeting him. He was disciplined for wearing a watch during games and sporting cleats that don’t follow the uniform policy.</p>
      <p>The latest matter that has Beckham furious with the NFL is how they distribute drug tests.</p>
      <p>Following the game on Thursday, the Pro Bowl wideout told cleveland.com that he’s been tested multiple times per week by the NFL. That includes right after the game this week.</p>
      <p>Drug tests are supposed to be random, but Beckham thinks the league is going out of its way to test him.</p>
      <p>From <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/browns/2019/11/odell-beckham-jr-tells-clevelandcom-hes-upset-over-volume-of-random-drug-tests-nobody-is-getting-tested-like-me.html?outputType=amp&amp;__twitter_impression=true">cleveland.com</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“(The NFL) made me come in Monday when we had an off day. Had a drug test,” Beckham said. “Made me come in Thursday after the game. Had another drug test.<br/><br/>“Nobody is getting tested like me,” Beckham said. “I know people who didn’t get tested for five months in the offseason and I’m getting tested every time.”</blockquote>
      <p>Last season, Eric Reid called out the NFL for being tested on a weekly basis.</p>
      <p>It’s hard to prove whether or not the league is actually going against Beckham with all these drug tests. Regardless, the drama never ends in Cleveland.</p>
