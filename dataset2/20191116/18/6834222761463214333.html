      <h1>MotoGP, Marquez: "Alex in Honda with me? He would be a rival like any other."</h1>

      <p>We could talk about Marquez's second place in qualifying, about the chance to finish the season with the teams title or with another victory, but <b>the questions for him have only been about one subject: his brother Alex. All they're talking about in the paddock in Valencia are the two brothers united under the same roof, namely Honda's in 2020.</b></p>
      <p>"<i><b>I said it yesterday. The decision isn't in my hands. Honda and Alex have to decide,</b></i> " Marc said<i>. "I know he's on the list of possible riders, and this makes me proud, but he's not alone</i>."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sharing the box with you is not a walk in the park...</b>
      </p>
      <p>"<i><b>Everyone knows that Honda is one of the most difficult bikes with which to debut in the MotoGP, and being in the official team is a great responsibility</b>. In fact, some riders refused this chance in the past. That's<b> why I say that it's Alex who has to agree to this project</b></i>."</p>
      <p>
        <b>But wouldn't you like to race with your brother?</b>
      </p>
      <p>"<i><b>I'm first and foremost a professional. So, if it were to happen, my teammate would be the Moto2 world champion, not my brother.</b> I first shared the pit-box with Pedrosa, then with Lorenzo, and I don't know who it'll be next year, but I know that I'll work to win the World Championship. I don't care about anything else</i>."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Are you being entirely honest?</b>
      </p>
      <p>"<i><b>Point number 1 is that anyone who is my teammate is a rival for me. Then, I certainly want the best for my brother</b>, as for every person I care about. That's normal</i>."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Aren't you giving him any advice?</b>
      </p>
      <p>"<i>We haven't talked about it at all. We arrived in Valencia just to enjoy the last race of the year, and at least I'm doing so,</i>" he said, laughing<i>. "Emilio Alzamora, his and my manager, and the heads at Honda have to discuss and understand what the best solution is. <b>I don't even know if they had a meeting</b></i>."</p>
      <p>
        <b>But you said that Alex would be ready for the MotoGP.</b>
      </p>
      <p>"<i><b>Everyone must follow their own path, make their own choices</b>. I said that Honda has two options: either hire an experienced rider or bet on a young one</i>."</p>
      <p>
        <b>If you were the Honda team manager, who would you choose?</b>
      </p>
      <p>"<i>The MotoGP world champion!" He laughed.</i> "<i>I don't know what I would decide. There would be so many things to evaluate. <b>Alex doesn't need me. He's showing what he's worth on the track, and I have no intention of forcing the situation because I'm a professional</b>. Alex has to decide what is best for him</i>."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Without any interference?</b>
      </p>
      <p>"<i><b>He has to follow his own path. The one that is best for him, not the one I create for him</b>. He may have a different vision than mine, and rightly so, because he is 23 and must understand what the project he wants to follow is</i>."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Among the many questions about the future, we risk forgetting tomorrow's race.</b>
      </p>
      <p>"<i><b>On paper, I have the chance to fight for the victory</b>. I didn't think I was that close to Quartararo in qualifying today. He and Vinales seem to be the biggest rivals, but you can never tell with Miller, especially in the early laps</i>."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Have you taken advantage of these two days, even for some tests in view of next year?</b>
      </p>
      <p>"<i>Yes, since <b>2020 is approaching and some new pieces have already arrived. </b>This complicated the weekend a bit and, when I fell in the FP4, I was experimenting. But I feel good, both with the soft tire as well as the hard for the rear</i>."</p>
