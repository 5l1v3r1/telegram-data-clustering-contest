      <h1>FOX’s Joel Klatt Is Crushing The Officials In Michigan vs. Michigan State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T18:10:28+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 18:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matt-admin" target="_blank">Matt Lombardi</a></address>
      <p>Michigan vs. Michigan State has been a tightly-contested affair so far. FOX Sports announcer Joel Klatt doesn’t seem to be impressed with the job the officials are doing during the contest.</p>
      <p>Klatt, numerous times, has disagreed with calls on the field. Early, he criticized the referees for calling pass interference on Michigan but not doing so on Michigan State on the next drive.</p>
      <p>He later took exception to the officials reversing a touchdown for Michigan State after a review.</p>
      <p>He’s made it clear that he’s not a fan of how the game is being officiated. Some are accusing him of having Michigan bias, but that doesn’t really seem to be the case.</p>

      <p>Michigan State <a href="https://thespun.com/big-ten/michigan-wolverines/kirk-herbstreit-doesnt-think-michigan-michigan-state-will-be-close">wasn’t given much of a chance in this game by a few top analysts</a>, but the Spartans have performed well thus far.</p>
      <p>Michigan entered the game with a 7-2 record and hopes of a strong finish as it heads toward the Ohio State game. Michigan State has a 4-5 record and just wants to reach a bowl game at this point.</p>
      <p>It’s currently 7-7 midway through the second quarter. You can catch the game on FOX.</p>
