      <p>Lauren Drain showed off her athletic figure in a bid to get fans to sign up for her fitness program.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/lauren-drain/">Lauren Drain</a>, who has earned the unofficial title of the “World’s Sexiest Nurse,” recently took to Instagram to show off the fit figure that helped make her famous. However, her striking throwback swimsuit snapshot included a reminder that looking like she does takes a lot of hard work.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, Lauren Drain took to Instagram to share the bathing suit snapshot with her 3.9 million Instagram followers. In the image, the fitness model was pictured flaunting her sculpted physique in a nude swimsuit that slightly resembled lingerie. It featured a deep V-neck that dipped down to the bottom of her bust, putting her prodigious cleavage on full display.</p>
      <p>The material of the bathing suit was a few shades lighter than Lauren’s golden skin. It featured black lace embellishments that trailed down from the garment’s black spaghetti straps, gradually growing larger before blooming into exquisite floral shapes. The neckline and the area right below Lauren’s bust were also trimmed in black. Around her neck, Lauren wore a slender choker that matched the trim.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old blond bombshell was rocking a pair of high-heeled sandals. The slinky lace-up shoes accentuated her muscular legs. Lauren wore her hair pulled back from her flawless face, save for one lock in the front, which she left free to swoop down near her right eye. For her beauty look, she sported light pink lipstick and dark eye makeup.</p>
      <p>Even though she was all glammed up, Lauren Drain chose a low-key location for her photo shoot; the model struck a pose in front of her kitchen. Lauren is currently pregnant, so her flat stomach in the picture is evidence that it is a throwback snapshot.</p>
