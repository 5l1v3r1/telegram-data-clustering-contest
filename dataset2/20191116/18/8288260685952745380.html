      <p>A 41-year-old man who crept into his sleeping victim's home and started kissing her has been jailed for eight years.</p>
      <p>Thames Valley Police said Ian Essom, of Ludlow Close, Northampton, entered the property in Olney at around 1am on November 18 last year as his victim was asleep in bed.</p>
      <p>When she resisted his advances, Essom restrained her before eventually leaving the property.</p>
      <p>Following a one-day trial at Aylesbury Crown Court on May 1, Essom was found guilty of trespass with intent to commit a sexual offence.</p>
      <p>When sentenced at the same court on Thursday, he was jailed for eight years and placed on the sex offenders register for life.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>In August 2018, Essom was given a two-year restraining order for repeatedly staring at a 21-year-old woman as she worked late shifts at a petrol station in April of that year.</p>
      <p>Following his arrest, he was found guilty of harassment and given a 12-week prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, police said.</p>
      <p>Speaking after Essom was jailed on Thursday, Detective Constable Kim McHugh said: "I would like to thank the victim for coming forward to police and for supporting us with the investigation.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"She has shown great strength in giving evidence at trial.</p>
      <p>"Thames Valley Police does not tolerate this behaviour and we will work tirelessly to investigate thoroughly and bring offenders to justice.</p>
      <p>"I hope this conviction gives others the confidence to come forward and make a report to the police."</p>
