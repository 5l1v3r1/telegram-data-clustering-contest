      <p>Galway champions Oughterard produced a strong second-half performance to deservedly claim the Connaught intermediate football championship title at Elverys MacHale Park, Castlebar, this evening.</p>
      <p>It finished 1-16 to 0-11 in favour of the Galway outfit against Mayo representatives The Neale.</p>
      <p>The sides were well-matched in the first half - inseparable, in fact, at 0-7 each - and when Tommy Conroy fired The Neale into the lead with an early second-half point, things were looking good for the home side.</p>
      <p>However, Oughterard reeled off 1-4 without reply in the opening 15 minutes of the second half and it was to prove just too big a mountain to climb for the Mayo champions, who were held to that single point for 27 minutes of the second half until Sean Cosgrove landed a free on 55 minutes.</p>
      <p>The goal was well crafted from a fine move and finished by man of the match and top scorer Matthew Tierney, but The Neale were left to rue a couple of missed goal chances of their own in the first half.</p>
      <p>The Mayo champions crafted two excellent opportunities. Simon Ryan cracked one off the crossbar but the best opening was presented to Oisin Connolly, who had the chance of a tap-in goal served on a plate by Aidan O’Sullivan but an Oughterard defender somehow managed to keep it out of the net.</p>
      <p>The Galway champions turned up the heat in the second half and outscored their opponents by 1-9 to 0-4 to run out winners by 1-16 to 0-11.</p>
