      <h1>Tua Tagovailoa Was Reportedly “Screaming In Pain” After Hip Injury vs. Mississippi State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T18:46:48+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 18:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matt-admin" target="_blank">Matt Lombardi</a></address>
      <p>Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa suffered what appeared to be a significant hip injury just before halftime of his team’s game against Mississippi State on Saturday afternoon. Apparently, Tagovailoa was in a great deal of pain.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa was dragged to the ground by two Bulldogs defenders and appeared to land awkwardly. ESPN’s Molly McGrath reports that the Alabama quarterback was “screaming in pain” on the ground after the injury.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa was carted off the field. The only word we have is that it’s some kind of hip injury.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa came into the game nursing an ankle injury he suffered against Tennessee back in October. He played against LSU after a “tightrope” surgery just two weeks prior.</p>

      <p>Alabama led Mississippi State 35-7 at the time of the injury. Crimson Tide head coach Nick Saban told reporters at halftime that Tagovailoa got hurt on what was going to be his final series of the game anyway.</p>
      <p>Alabama needs help to win the SEC West, but it still has a shot at the College Football Playoff. If Tagovailoa can’t play against Auburn in two weeks, the Crimson Tide could struggle.</p>
      <p>We’ll update you as more information becomes available.</p>
