      <h1>Video: Mississippi State Fans Show Great Class After Tua Tagovailoa Injury</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T18:55:43+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 18:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>In the final moments of the first half of Alabama’s game against Mississippi State, star quarterback <a href="https://thespun.com/sec/alabama-crimson-tide/injury-update-for-alabama-qb-tua-tagovailoa-vs-mississippi-state">Tua Tagovailoa left the game on a cart</a>.</p>
      <p>He rolled out to his left, but was hit by two Mississippi State defenders. Head coach Nick Saban revealed Tua suffered a hip injury on the play.</p>
      <p>Tua, who played last weekend in a limited capacity against LSU, is also recovering from an ankle injury. While he played last weekend, it was clear he wasn’t at 100-percent – he even said after the game that he played on one foot.</p>
      <p>Several analysts, including Tim Tebow, suggested Tua shouldn’t play in today’s game.</p>
      <p>Regardless, as Tagovailoa left the game on a cart before the end of the first half, Bulldogs fans showed an incredible amount of sportsmanship for the injured quarterback.</p>
      <p>Mississippi State fans rang their cowbells as Tua left the field.</p>
      <p>Check it out.</p>

      <p>That’s all class from the home fans.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa completed 14-of-18 passing for 256 yards and two touchdowns before leaving the game. It’s a tough scene for Alabama, which is in the midst of yet another College Football Playoff race.</p>
      <p>Backup quarterback Mac Jones will likely come in for the second half.</p>
      <p>Stay tuned for the latest on Tua heading into the second half.</p>
