      <p>Torquay United missed a big chance to strengthen their National League promotion chances when lowly Sutton United inflicted the injury-hit Gulls' fourth home defeat of the season 2-1 in front of nearly 2,800 fans at Plainmoor.</p>
      <p>Right-back Ben Wynter equalised Kyel Reid's early goal for Sutton before half-time, but Harry Beautyman's 69th minute goal won it for the Ambers.</p>
      <p>The loss also lengthened Torquay's injury-list to eight players, Frank Vincent in the first half and Ben Whitfield in the second both limping off.</p>

      <p>United dropped a place to sixth, although they are still only three points off new leaders Barrow.</p>
      <p>"On the day we didn't have enough quality, or someone who could open up their defence," said manager Gary Johnson.</p>
      <p>"There was endeavour, but nobody showed enough real quality play.</p>
      <p>"We've had two games now where we haven't done enough, but we are having to make too many changes all the time.</p>
      <p>"The league isn't over, and if someone had said at the start of the season that we would be three points off the top at this point, we would have ripped their arms off.</p>
      <p>"We've already got seven loans, so we can't keep doing that, and we are in a position where we are keeping our fingers crossed that no one else gets injured."</p>
      <p>Johnson made a tactical switch from the side which lost at Maidstone (0-1) in the Cup - he recalled Jean-Yves Koue Niate in central defence and introduced new signing Ramarni Medford-Smith in a 3-4-1-2 formation.</p>
      <p>Out went winger Kalvin Kalala to the bench, with Medford-Smith replacing injured attacking left-back Liam Davis.</p>
      <p>Sutton picked both their Friday loan signings - New Zealand international goalie Nikola Tzanev from AFC Wimbledon and right-back Louis John from Cambridge United.</p>
      <p>After a full-on start, which saw Niate and Matt Buse have goalbound efforts blocked, Sutton caught United out in the 12th minute.</p>
      <p>Winger Reid brushed aside a Vincent challenge, got a lucky ricochet off Robbie Cundy and ran on to shoot under the advancing Lucas Covolan from 12 yards…0-1.</p>
      <p>Torquay then lost midfielder Vincent to an ankle injury, with Kalvin Kalala replacing him in an unaccustomed central role.</p>
      <p>But in the 31st minute an end-to-end move between Whitfield, Jamie Reid and Wynter saw Wynter finish with a cool angled shot across the keeper from 15 yards…1-1.</p>

      <p>His confidence up, Wynter then fired just wide from 30 yards, but on the stroke of half-time United had a real escape.</p>
      <p>Medford-Smith's clearance was cut out by Jon Barden, Niate missed his diagonal cross, but he recovered just in time to deflect the unmarked Harry Beautyman' shot wide when he seemed certain to score.</p>
      <p>Covolan kept United on terms with two smart saves just after half-time, from a Beautyman header and Bugiel's shot.</p>
      <p>But in the 69th minute the Brazilian goalie could not stop Sutton scoring again.</p>
      <p>Bugiel appeared to barge Cundy off a header, and Beautyman ran onto the loose ball and drove the ball under Covolan from ten yards…0-1.</p>
      <p>Niate had a snapshot deflected wide as United tried to save themselves in the closing stages, but those injuries had taken their toll, not just in personnel but also in confidence.</p>
      <p>Throughout it all captain Kyle Cameron was almost faultless at the back, solid in the air and assured on the ground.</p>

      <p>Johnson sent on Manny Duku for Niate in the 83rd minute, striker for centre-back, and pushed Cundy up front.</p>
      <p>Duku had a chance to level it in the 88th minute - Saikou Janneh's pass put him clear on the right, but Tzanev saved.</p>
      <p>Not even six minutes of stoppage-time was enough for the Gulls to save themselves.</p>
