      <h1>'Arsenal had no idea!' Paul Merson names the man to replace Unai Emery after exposing Gunners</h1>
      <h2>Paul Merson has been speaking about Arsenal and Unai Emery's future</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T18:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Clarke</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal legend Paul Merson has named the manager he feels should replace <a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/unai-emery">Unai Emery</a> if the Spaniard departs the Emirates.</p>
      <p>Emery has endured a tough time in his second season with <a href="https://www.football.london/arsenal-fc/">Arsenal</a> as the club continue to struggle for consistency.</p>
      <p>The Gunners sit sixth in the Premier League and eight points behind the Champions League qualification spots.</p>
      <p>Arsenal have only won one of their last five league matches, something which has poured the pressure on Emery.</p>
      <p>In contrast, Sheffield United are thriving after promotion last season from the Championship, with Chris Wilder having guided the Blades to fifth ahead of the international break.</p>
      <p>The Blades even managed to beat Arsenal last month, something which has convinced Merson that the 52-year-old is worthy of replacing Emery if the latter leaves the capital.</p>
      <p>"Chris Wilder has done a fantastic job at Sheffield United and deserves a crack at a really big job at some point," Merson told the <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/spurs-arsenal-told-consider-sheffield-20892125">Daily Star</a>.</p>
      <p>"We should all be talking about him right now but we’re not. Maybe his name’s too English? But look at what he’s achieved.</p>
      <p>"He was successful at Oxford and Northampton. Two tough jobs. And he’s taken Sheffield United back into the Premier League.</p>
      <p>"They are not keeping all those clean sheets by sticking ten men behind the ball either. They play some lovely stuff, get people in the box, and have a go at teams.</p>
      <p>"I think they have actually been a bit unlucky in some games this season but to see them up there in fifth is phenomenal.</p>
      <p>"I watched them play Arsenal and there was only one team who knew what they were doing. Arsenal had no idea. That’s good coaching.</p>
      <p>"Managers like Unai Emery and Manuel Pellegrini are under pressure, and okay you never know for sure if a manager can make such a big step up.</p>
