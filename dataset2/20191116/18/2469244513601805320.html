      <p>Ex-Cheltenham Town man Nigel Atangana said the Grecians were unlucky to only draw in their League Two clash on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Frenchman, who moved down the M5 to Exeter City in the summer, made his best home league start on Saturday against the club he spent the previous two years with.</p>
      <p>Atangana, 30, said that it was a tough game and City were unlucky not to come away with all three points.</p>
      <p>The Grecians had more possession and creating more chances, but failed to break down a tough Cheltenham side who have the best defensive record in the league.</p>

      <p>Atangana said: “It was a tough game. They were a good team with a good shape, and we were unlucky to draw. I think we did alright. We tried everything to score. We were unlucky today but we have to move on to the next game and think about Tuesday.”</p>
      <p>The City man missed the start of the season with injury and has come into the side following the suspension of skipper Jake Taylor, and formed a good partnership with Archie Collins in the middle of midfield, winning a lot of second balls and breaking up Cheltenham attacks.</p>
      <p>"I’ve got the ability to play the physical and the technical side of the game, I just have to respect what the gaffer asks of me, today me and Archie needed to win all the second balls, I think we did that really well in the first-half, the second-half was a bit harder but I’m just answering what the gaffer’s asked," he said.</p>
      <p>He added: “It is always easy to play with good players and we are lucky to have good midfielders, so if one of us is out, others can step in and perform.”</p>
