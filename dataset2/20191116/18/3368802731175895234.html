      <h1>Manipulating FIR: Judicial probe finds 5 cops responsible</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T18:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thedailystar.net/author/ashutosh-sarker" target="_blank">Ashutosh Sarker</a></address>
      <p>A judicial probe has found five police officials, including three additional superintendents of Rajshahi police, responsible in the manipulation of the first information report (FIR) of workers’ leader Nurul Islam murder case in June this year.</p>
      <p>The officials are: Additional Superintendents of Police Md Mahmudul Hasan (administration and crimes), M Matiur Rahman (DSB) and Md Abul Kalam Saahid (Puthia circle), Inspector Mohinul Islam (investigation) and the then officer-in-charge (OC) of Puthia Police Station Shakil Uddin Ahamed.</p>
      <p>Rajshahi’s Chief Judicial Magistrate Md Mehedi Hasan Talukder, who conducted the enquiry as per a High Court directive, has recently sent the probe report to the HC recommending orders on the authorities concerned to take legal action against the five officials and to record the FIR of the murder case with the police station.</p>
      <p>The HC bench of Justice M Enayetur Rahim and Justice Md Mostafizur Rahman is scheduled to hold hearing and pass an order on this issue today.</p>
      <p>In the report, Mehedi said Shakil’s behaviour with Nigar Sultana, daughter of Nurul Islam, was unlawful when the latter went to Puthia Police Station on June 11 to seek justice for her father’s murder.</p>
      <p>Taking this into account, it can be assumed that the OC had a role over manipulating the FIR, the report says.</p>
      <p>At the same time, the four other officials, who were present at the police station during filing of the FIR, cannot avoid responsibilities, says the report.</p>
      <p>The police administration failed to show cooperation, sympathy, and sincerity to a daughter who had sought justice just after losing her father, the magistrate commented in the probe report.  </p>
      <p>On September 16, the HC bench led by Justice M Enayetur Rahim directed the magistrate to conduct an enquiry into the alleged manipulation of the FIR by OC Shakil following a writ petition filed by Nigar.</p>
      <p>The court also asked the magistrate to submit the probe report to it in 45 days and the respondents to explain as to why OC Shakil should not be suspended for manipulating the FIR. </p>
