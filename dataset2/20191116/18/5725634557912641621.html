      <p>Five IPOs and two SPACs plan to raise $634 million in the week ahead.</p>
      <p>One of the leading makers of cryptocurrency mining equipment, Canaan (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CAN">CAN</a>) plans to raise $100 million at a $1.6 billion market cap. It originally filed to raise $400 million (and in 2018 was rumored to be targeting over $1 billion). The #2 player in the space, Canaan has shown that it's capable of being highly profitable, with a 61% net margin in the 1Q18. However, its performance is heavily influenced by Bitcoin prices; a price slump earlier in the year caused Canaan's sales to fall 96% in the 1Q19.</p>
      <p>Being carved out of Consolidated-Tomoka (NYSE: <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CTO">CTO</a>), retail and office REIT Alpine Income Property Trust (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PINE">PINE</a>) plans to raise $150 million at a $182 million market cap and a 4% yield at the midpoint. Alpine Income is small with a concentrated tenant base, but it has a 100% leased portfolio and a large acquisition pipeline that should drive future growth.</p>
      <p>Chinese debt collector YX Asset Recovery (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/YXR">YXR</a>) plans to raise $81 million at a $541 million market cap. YX Asset Recovery is the largest collector of tertiary receivables in China with a 9% market share, according to iResearch, with roughly $4 billion in receivables under collection as of 6/30/19.</p>
      <p>MegaChips spin off SiTime (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SITM">SITM</a>), a fabless producer of silicon timing systems, plans to raise $60 million at a $200 million market cap. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is currently experiencing a downturn, but SiTime has established itself as a leader in the silicon MEMS oscillators market, claiming a 90%+ share.</p>
      <p>Micro-cap auto e-tailer LMP Automotive Holdings (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LMPX">LMPX</a>) plans to raise $18 million at a $51 million market cap. The company had high growth in 2018, but revenue fell 28% in the 9mo19, and its gross margin has yet to swing positive.</p>
      <p>Former Ooyala executives' SPAC Software Acquisition Group (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SAQNU">SAQNU</a>) plans to raise $125 million, and Metalmark Capital and Avego Healthcare Capital's joint venture Amplitude Healthcare Acquisition (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMHCU">AMHCU</a>) plans to raise $100 million.</p>
      <p>Lock-up periods for Bicycle Therapeutics (NASDAQ:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BCYC">BCYC</a>), IDEAYA Biosciences (NASDAQ:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IDYA">IDYA</a>), and Rattler Midstream (NASDAQ:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RTLR">RTLR</a>) will be expiring this week on Tuesday, November 19.</p>
