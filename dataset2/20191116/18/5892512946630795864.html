      <h1>Highlights! Watch these equally insane elbow, flying knee knockouts from LFA and ONE Championship action</h1>

      <p>Prior to UFC Fight Night 164 setting sail later tonight (Sat., Nov. 16, 2019) from Sao Paulo, Brazil, fight fans were treated to fabulous knockout finishes in two other prominent MMA promotions.</p>
      <p>The first stoppage came last night at LFA 78 from Belton, Texas, as the promotion was making its broadcast debut on UFC Fight Pass. In the co-main event, bantamweight prospect Jose Johnson squared off with Rafael Costa.</p>
      <p>During a Costa takedown attempt along the cage midway through the first round, Johnson landed an absolutely brutal elbow to the side of the head. Costa immediately went limp and fell to the canvas in violent fashion. The strike initially looked like it could have hit the back of Costa's head, but replays showed it was clean.</p>
      <p>Check out the finish below courtesy of MMA Junkie:</p>

      <p>The other spectacular finish came earlier this morning at ONE Championship: 'Age of Dragons' from Beijing, China, when Jeremy Miado squared off with Li Tao Miao in an entertaining flyweight bout.</p>
      <p>After back-and-forth action to begin the first round, Miado was able to find a home for a punishing flying knee as Miao moved in for an attack. The knee connected flush and instantly sent Miao to the canvas.</p>
      <p>It was quite the impressive finish for Miado and his third knockout stoppage since the start of 2018. Check it out below:</p>

      <p>Not a bad start to the combat weekend. Hopefully UFC Sao Paulo can add to the madness.</p>
