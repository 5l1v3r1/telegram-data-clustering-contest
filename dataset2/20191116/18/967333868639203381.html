        <b>The Russian aircraft is a fifth-generation air superiority stealth fighter that performed its maiden flight back in 2010. It is currently in the final stage of development and is expected to be available after 2020.</b>

      <p>The Sukhoi <a href="https://sputniknews.com/military/201911091077265499-media-releases-video-of-russias-su-57-stealth-jet-assembly/">Su-57 is better than its American counterparts,</a> Russian Maj. General Vladimir Popov stated on Saturday. According to the veteran military pilot, the F-22 is too expensive and needs numerous improvements, while the F-35 is overloaded with sophisticated technologies that make it difficult to operate.</p>
      <p>At the same time, he noted that the Su-57 can reach Mach-plus speeds without afterburning and has high manoeuvrability.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://sputniknews.com/military/201910291077175244-these-five-countries-may-buy-russian-su-57-stealth-jet-according-to-us-media/">F-35 Lightning II and the F-22 Raptor</a> are both designed by Lockheed Martin and serve as the newest fifth-generation fighter jets in the American military. While production of the F-22 was terminated in 2011, with only 195 planes built, the F-35 programme is still active, with deliveries to the US military scheduled until 2037.</p>
      <p>The Russian aircraft, however, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/military/201904021073770597-Moscow-May-Offer-China-Turkey-Export-Su57/">is expected to cost only 40 percent of the American jet's price</a> at roughly $40 to $45 million per plane, compared to the F-35, which costs over $100 million, making it a more interesting option to purchase for countries that don't have their own fifth-generation jet in the works.</p>
      <p>According to The National Interest, the <a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/russias-su-57-stealth-fighter-heading-china-and-india-91526">Su-57 could be purchased</a> by China, India, Myanmar, Algeria, and Turkey â€“ especially after the US suspended Ankara from the F-35 programme.</p>
