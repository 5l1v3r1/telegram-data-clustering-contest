      </p>
      <p>East Kilbride caretaker boss Jim Paterson wants to bring the fear factor back to K-Park after they beat Gretna to land their first home league win since September.</p>
      <p>Kilby had lost four out of six home games this season going into the clash, but first half strikes from Ruari Paton and Craig Malcolm earned the three points.</p>
      <p>And it was their third home win on the spin after cup wins over East Stirling and Tynecastle in the last week.</p>
      <p>Paterson, who took the reins after Stuart Malcolm's exit for League One Forfar last week, said: “This season at home we’ve sort of stuttered, so teams have been coming here and enjoying it, whereas I want them coming here and fearing is because they could lose a right few goals.</p>
      <p>“In terms of the talent that’s in our dressing room I’ve probably got the hardest job in the league, trying to keep everyone happy because I can’t play all 18 of them.</p>

      <p>“But I know whatever 11 I put in the Park is capable of winning games in this league.</p>
      <p>“It’s been three positive home games in the last few weeks, with three clean sheets so it gives us something to build on.”</p>
      <p>Earlier in the week Paterson brought goalkeeper Alan Martin back from the wilderness following his fallout with former boss Stuart Malcolm, but Matt McGinley maintained his spot between the sticks for this one.</p>

      <p>Kilby had an early let off when David Brownlie was judged to have clipped Dean Manunike in the box after six minutes and the Gretna striker rattled the crossbar from the resulting penalty.</p>
      <p>But within three minutes the hosts took the lead when Paton finished off a flowing move, drilling the ball into the bottom corner from the edge of the box.</p>
      <p>EK were vastly improved from Tuesday's narrow 1-0 win over Tynecastle in the East of Scotland Qualifying Cup and skipper Craig Malcolm doubled their lead on the half hour mark.</p>
      <p>Another great move fed the ball out wide to Paul Woods and when he crossed into the box, Malcolm managed to salvage a poor first touch by hooking the ball over the keeper into the far corner.</p>
      <p>Gretna rarely troubled McGinley and in 53 minutes player/boss Chris Humphrey’s 25-yard free-kick brought out a comfortable save from the Kilby keeper.</p>
      <p>EK broke a few times in the second half in search of a third, but Paton and Bernard Coll both fired wide from good positions.</p>

      <p>Malcolm had a chance at the death to put some gloss on the scoreline but he was thwarted by Taylor in the Gretna goal.</p>
      <p>Kilby remain eighth in the Lowland League and Paterson added: “I’m delighted to get the points.</p>
      <p>“Gretna missed a penalty at the start that could have made a tricky for us. In my view it looked as though the player slipped, but the ref gave it and they missed.</p>
      <p>“Our reaction after that was excellent.</p>
      <p>“We scored two goals and some of the counter attacking football we played could have had us well out of sight by half-time.</p>
      <p>“I’ve explained to the players I want to play passing football, but at the same time I’m looking to break the lines, get in behind, create loads of chances, so they done well with what I was asking.</p>
      <p>“They really bought into it so I was delighted with them.”</p>
      <p>For now, Paterson has the opportunity to fend off competition from rumoured rivals such as former Dumbarton boss Stevie Aitken and Rangers hero Ian Durrant for the job and a result away to Formartine United in the Scottish Cup next week would further enhance his hopes of landing his first permanent manager role.</p>
