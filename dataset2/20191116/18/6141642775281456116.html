      <p>France skipper Raphael Varane insists Kylian Mbappe can do more for the national team.</p>
      <p>The World Cup champions travel to Albania on Sunday having booked their spot at Euro 2020 on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Didier Deschamps’ side went to the top of Group H with a laboured 2-1 win over Moldova after Varane’s leveller in Paris.</p>
      <p>The team were criticised for their performance and Real Madrid’s Varane has urged PSG’s Mbappe to up his game.</p>
      <p>“He can do better, he is aware of it. He has a lot of qualities: in the field, he has to choose because he can not do everything at the same time,” he told L’Equipe.</p>
      <p>“Offensively, we need more movement (and) play our football, which we did not manage to do in the first period.”</p>
      <p>Arsenal’s Matteo Guendouzi could be handed a debut with Deschamps’ side looking to qualify as group winners.</p>
      <p>France moved above Turkey in the group following Olivier Giroud’s late winner against Moldova, who are bottom of the table.</p>
      <p>“We come here to finish first in the group. We are world champions and we approach every game to win it,” Varane, who scored his fifth international goal on Thursday, added.</p>
      <p>“It will not be a simple match.”</p>
