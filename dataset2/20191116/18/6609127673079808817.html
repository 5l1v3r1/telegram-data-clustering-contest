      <p>And while they were disappointed to see their side eliminated after the Light Blues strolled to a 2-0 victory, supporters took their chance to take a swipe at <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14923/rangers/">Gers</a> fans.</p>
      <p>A banner which had he badges of <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Celtic</a>, Bohemians and Wrexham was held aloft in the rammed away section.</p>
      <p>Green and white Hoops scarves were also waved as fans taunted the Ibrox faithful during the match.</p>
      <p>But the Light Blues youngster made easy work of the clash on the park as Jamie Barjonas and Nathan Young-Coombes scored either side of the break.</p>

      <p>Jon Flanagan and George Edmundson were handed run-outs in the youth side defence as they secured a win in front of just over 5000 fans.</p>
