      <p>With its state-of-the-art gym and en-suite bedrooms, University of Derby students are loving life at The Croft.</p>
      <p>Launched in September, the £23m complex is the <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/derby-news/the-croft-derby-3267194">latest addition to the student accommodation</a> on offer in Derby.</p>
      <p>Inside the complex, there are 326 bedrooms with en-suites in every room, a free gym, games area and a small study space.</p>
      <p>The privately-owned accommodation is made up of two tower blocks, each containing clusters of rooms.</p>
      <p>Flat sizes range from four to eight bedroom properties and there are three room sizes for students to choose from.</p>
      <p>Thanks to a new interactive tool, members of the public can now take a virtual tour of the building, which still has rooms available to rent.</p>

      <p>They range from the smallest 'Premium En-Suite' size to the largest "XL Premium En-Suite".</p>
      <p>The largest room is Disability Discrimination Act compliant, which means they are able to cater for students with disabilities.</p>
      <p>The cheapest room is £137 per week on a 51-week contract while the most expensive room is priced at £145 per week.</p>

      <p>Each cluster of flats is locked with keycard access and has a shared kitchen featuring a 50-inch 4K television and sofas.</p>
      <p>Built by Prosperity Capital, the two tower blocks boast "the best communal facilities of any student development".</p>
      <p>Chief executive Gavin Barry said it is the only complex in Derby to have a free-to-use on-site gym.</p>
      <p>He said: "These things need to come as standard. That doesn't necessarily mean 'luxury'."</p>
      <p>Mr Barry added that student accommodation brings "vibrancy to the city centre" and creates a "buzz".</p>

      <p>Host Students are the accommodation provider who run The Croft.</p>
      <p>Mick Stoddard, the Host hall manager, said in his opinion it has "the best common room in the city, there's nothing else like this at all in Derby."</p>
      <p>He said students are "very happy with it" and are using it "constantly".</p>
      <p>In the common room there is a Play Station which is free to use and Mr Stoddard said Host Students are "building a catalogue of games".</p>
      <p>As well as the common areas, students also have access to a free gym which has free weights, exercise machines and disabled access.</p>

      <p>Other facilities include a laundry room which contains five washing machines and five tumble dryers.</p>
      <p>There's a free bus service from the accommodation which takes less than 10 minutes to get to the Kedleston Campus.</p>
      <p>For those who prefer to walk or cycle, there are 84 cycle racks for students to use free of charge.</p>
