      <p>AJ Pritchard finally makes his debut on Drag Race UK during next week's final - but not everyone is happy about it.</p>
      <p>The Strictly pro, 25, appears on the show with "little brother" Curtis - aka, the one who liked to deliver everyone's coffees in the morning on Love Island.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the big final, AJ is tasked with choreographing the drag queens' choreography, but it doesn't exactly go to plan.</p>
      <p>Divina de Campo, Baga Chipz and the Vivienne have made it to the final three after Cheryl Hole got the boot last week.</p>
      <p>In a preview for the last episode, the trio are told they need to complete a dance performance before lipsyncing for the crown.</p>

      <p>The next clip sees them standing on the stage as they face AJ and Curtis.</p>
      <p>AJ tells them: "I'm AJ and this is my little brother Curtis."</p>
      <p>Running through the choreography with the Vivienne, AJ looks unimpressed.</p>
      <p>A couple of times, AJ tells the Vivienne to "redo, redo".</p>

      <p>The Vivienne looks frustrated and later tells the camera: "He keeps shouting at me!"</p>
      <p>Tonight, AJ will compete at the famous Blackpool ballroom with partner Saffron Barker.</p>
      <p>The pair have been achieving near-perfect scores from the judges - will they impress again tonight."</p>
