        <b>Conor O'Shea has resigned as head-coach of the Italian rugby team after three years in the role.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The former Ireland full-back was contracted with the Azzurri until the end of the 2020 Six Nations but the Italian Federation has accepted his decision with "regret".</p>
      <p>O'Shea's last game in charge was Italy's 49-3 defeat to eventual champions South Africa at the Rugby World Cup and he's now being linked with a role with England.</p>
      <p>"I loved every minute I spent in Italy and I really believe in what we did and how it can be achieved in the years to come," the 48-year-old said of his departure.</p>
      <p>"We have started a process and generated a new, well-founded hope, but I also believe that the end of the Rugby World Cup represents the best time for everyone to make the changes in view of the new cycle. I built friendships and made experiences that I will never forget.</p>
      <p>"The job of all of us is to leave the shirt in a better place than the one in which we found it, I sincerely hope to have left the Italian rugby in a better position. The young people who are coming join a system that, by continuing with the right decisions, can only improve in the years to come."</p>
