      <h1>Jonah Holmes scores four tries as Leicester cruise past Pau</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T18:09:37+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 18:09</time> by <a rel="author">By Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>Leicester started their first European Challenge Cup campaign with a comfortable 41-20 win over <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/pau">Pau</a> as Welsh winger <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/leicester/players/jonah-holmes/">Jonah Holmes</a> scored four tries.</p>
      <p>Fly-half <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/leicester/players/george-ford/">George Ford</a>, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/is-this-weekend-that-could-turn-leicester-tigers-miserable-season-around">back on club duty following England’s run to the World Cup final in Japan</a>, kicked an early penalty before <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/leicester/players/george-worth/">George Worth</a> went over in the 13th minute and Holmes quickly added a second try.</p>
      <p>Pau scrum-half <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/pau/players/thibault-daubagna/">Thibault Daubagna</a> crossed from close range before Holmes made the most of an offload from Ford to break down the right as the home side went into half-time 24-13 ahead.</p>
      <p>Holmes completed his hat-trick five minutes into the second half, but Pau lock Fabric Metz bundled over a converted try on 66 minutes to bring the score to 31-20. A fourth converted try for Holmes made sure there would be no comeback, Ford finishing with five successful kicks.</p>
      <p>Saturday’s other Pool 5 game saw Cardiff <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/blues">Blues</a> run out 38-16 winners at Calvisano to secure a bonus point. Full-back <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/cardiff-blues/players/matthew-morgan/">Matthew Morgan</a> collected his own chip behind the home defence to open the scoring after five minutes. The Italians, though, fought back after a penalty and a converted try from Giacomo De Santis.</p>

      <p>Seb Davies’ try saw Cardiff in front 17-10 at the break. Two penalties from Paolo Pescetto brought the hosts back into contention, but tries from <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/cardiff-blues/players/james-botham/">James Botham</a>, Rey Lee-Lo and Harri Millard’s late score wrapped things up.</p>
      <p>The Blues, who lifted the trophy in 2018, host <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/leicester">Leicester</a> at the Arms Park in their next European fixture. Elsewhere in Pool 4, Premiership leaders <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/bristol">Bristol</a> ran in eight tries to thrash <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/zebre">Zebre</a> 59-21, with fly-half <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/mitre-10-cup/teams/wellington/players/ioan-lloyd/">Ioan Lloyd</a> chalking up 22 points on his first start.</p>

      <p>The Bears fell behind early on to a converted try from <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/italy/players/mattia-bellini/">Mattia Bellini</a>, but then never looked back, adding five of their own before the break. Academy duo Charlie Powell and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/bristol/players/andy-uren/">Andy Uren</a> were also among the try-scorers late on.</p>
      <p>In Pool 1, Dragons also secured a bonus-point win as they saw off <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/castres">Castres</a> 31-17 at Rodney Parade with three tries from number eight <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/gwent-dragons/players/taine-basham/">Taine Basham</a> which all came in the first half.</p>
