      <p>Mrs Sharon Ikeazor, the Minister of State, Federal Ministry of Environment said on Saturday that open defecation could lead to an increase in the rate of sexual assault on children and women.</p>
      <p>Ikeazor made this known at the 2019 World Toilet Day 10,000 Man-March against Open Defecation in Nigeria, held in Abuja.</p>
      <p>She said that many women and girls were being sexually assaulted as they defecated in the bush.</p>
      <p>The theme for this year’s celebration is “Toilet for All: Focusing on leaving no one behind.”</p>
      <p>Participants in the roadshow included civil servants, primary and secondary school children, National Youth Service Corps members, representatives of Non-Governmental Organisations, and Gbagi youths.</p>
      <p>Ikeazor, who was represented by Mr Peter Daniang, the Director of Human Resources in the ministry said that the roadshow was in commemoration of the forthcoming World Toilet Day, designated by the United Nations General Assembly to hold on every November 19.</p>
      <p>She said that unsafe and unclean toilets could cause various problems including the spread of diseases such as typhoid, cholera, diarrhoea and, hepatitis.</p>
      <p>“The sanitation crisis that exists in many parts of the country and the impact it has on human beings and nature cannot be ignored.</p>
      <p>“The ministry is urging each and every one of you to redouble your efforts in ensuring that everyone everywhere has access to toilet, leaving no one behind,’’ she said.</p>
