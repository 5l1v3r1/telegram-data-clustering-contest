      <p>DAYTON, Ohio — A friend of the gunman in the deadly Dayton mass shooting is expected to plead guilty to unrelated federal firearms charges.</p>
      <p>Court documents show 24-year-old Ethan Kollie will be in court Wednesday. No details of his plea agreement have been disclosed.</p>
      <p>Kollie is accused of lying on a federal firearms form and possessing a gun while using illegal drugs.</p>
      <p>Authorities have said there’s no indication Kollie knew his friend Connor Betts was planning the Aug. 4 shooting in Dayton that killed nine people before police killed Betts.</p>
      <p>The handgun Kollie is charged with illegally purchasing wasn’t used in the shooting.</p>
      <p>Investigators said Kollie told them he bought the body armour, a 100-round magazine and a part for Betts’ gun.</p>
      <p>A message seeking comment was left Saturday with Kollie’s attorneys.</p>
