      <p>Carles Perez trained with Barça B on Saturday. The forward, who has been with the first team all season, joined in with Garcia Pimienta's side given Ernesto Valverde has given the first team the weekend off due to the international break.</p>
      <p>However, Perez is not taking a few days off and is instead working with the B team ahead of Sunday's game against UE Cornella at the Johan Cruyff stadium. He will drop down to play for the reserves to get some minutes in the Spanish third division. He hasn't played regularly for the first team recently but did score in the midweek friendly win over Cartagena.</p>
      <p>In addition to Perez, Barça Juvenil A (U19s9 duo Arnau Tenas (goalkeeper) and Ilaix Moriba (midfielder) have also been training with the B team. They could be included in the squad on Sunday, too.</p>
      <p>Barça B are fifth in their division with 20 points, five points behind leaders Lleida. Cornella are 10th with 16 points.</p>
