      <h1>Fraudsters use I-T refund as bait for phishing attacks</h1>
      <h2>Victims lost money when they clicked on links sent to them by SMS</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T18:58:14+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 18:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/R-Sivaraman-304/" target="_blank">R. Sivaraman</a></address>
      <p>An employee in a private firm in Pallavaram lost ₹1.2 lakh after he clicked on a message enticing him with remittance of an income tax refund.</p>
      <p>The victim received an SMS on his mobile phone — with a heading BZ — which did not display the sender’s number. The message said that income tax refund had accumulated in his account and that he should click on a link provided in the message for receiving a remittance.</p>
      <p>The victim unsuspectingly clicked on the link and landed on his bank’s netbanking website, where he ended up entering his user name and password. Within seconds, he had lost ₹1.2 lakh to a fraudster who transferred the money to unknown accounts.</p>
      <p>Similarly, another victim from Purasawalkam received a message stating that his income tax refund was approved and would be credited to his account.</p>
      <p>It asked him to update his bank record in the link. Though he clicked the link, he deleted it subsequently sensing trouble. Yet, he lost money to the fraudsters.</p>
      <p>Both the victims of the phishing attacks lodged complaints with the Central Crime Branch of the police.</p>
      <p>“Earlier, conmen indulged in phishing by calling the victims and enticing them to share the One-Time Password on the pretext of updating Aadhaar number and PAN or bank account,” said a senior police officer.</p>
      <p>“Now, they adopt a new phishing method.They just send a malicious link and swindle the money, leaving the account-holders high and dry,” the official added.</p>
      <p>“The attackers can send any link to anyone. This is spoofing. They send [what looks] like an official message from the Income Tax department stating that he or she is eligible for refund,” said Capt. Vineet Kumar, president of Cyber Peace Foundation.</p>
      <p>“If the victim clicks on the links sent to their mobile or mail, there is a high possibility that a malware is installed on the mobile and takes them to a fake website resembling the bank’s. Then a form is provided to fill details. As the phone is compromised, the hacker gets the OTP and get the money,” he added.</p>
