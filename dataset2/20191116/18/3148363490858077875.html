      <p>Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-pentagon/amazon-challenges-pentagons-10-billion-cloud-award-to-microsoft-idUSKBN1XO308?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=topNews">reports</a> that Amazon is challenging the Pentagons’ decision to award a $10 billion cloud-computing deal to Microsoft, alleging that political bias affected the decision. The company filed a formal notice to protest the decision on the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud (JEDI) this week.</p>
      <p>Amazon Web Services’ CEO Andy Jassy said in a company-wide email that it would be challenging for a government body to be objective when awarding a contract when the President of the United States is disparaging one of the contestants. This is in reference to President Donald Trump’s criticism of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.</p>
      <p>Amazon confirmed Jassy’s comments stating: “Numerous aspects of the JEDI evaluation process contained clear deficiencies, errors, and unmistakable bias- and it’s important that these matters be examined and rectified.”</p>
      <p>U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper has rejected the implication of any political bias in the decisionmaking process. Esper told a news conference in Seoul, South Korea: “I am confident it was conducted freely and fairly, without any type of outside influence.”</p>
      <p>Esper removed himself from the decision-making process in October due to his son’s employment with one of the original contract applicants, IBM, which had previously bid for the contract and since left the competition.</p>
