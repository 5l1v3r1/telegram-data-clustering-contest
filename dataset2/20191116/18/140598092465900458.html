      <h1>Diplomat had to 'hold phone away from ear' as Donald Trump loudly asked about Joe Biden investigation</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T18:45:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 18:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/nick-allen/" target="_blank">Nick Allen</a></address>
      <p>A US diplomat has told Congress he overheard <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/donald-trump-impeachment/">Donald Trump</a> on a phone call asking about getting the president of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden.</p>
      <p>Mr Trump was speaking so loudly that the person he was talking to had to hold the phone away from their ear, allowing those nearby to hear what was being said.</p>
      <p>The call was described by David Holmes, the political counselor at the US embassy in Kyiv, in evidence given behind closed doors to the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/impeachment-long-does-process-take/">impeachment inquiry</a>.</p>
      <p>Mr Holmes said he was having lunch with Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union, and two others, on the terrace of a restaurant in Kyiv on July 26.</p>
      <p>It was the day after Mr Trump had talked by phone to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, pressing him to investigate Mr Biden.</p>
      <p>A whistleblower's complaint about that call led to the impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <p>During the lunch Mr Sondland used his mobile phone to place the call to Mr Trump.</p>
      <p>Mr Holmes said: "Sondland told Trump that Zelenskiy 'loves your ass'.</p>
      <p>"I then heard President Trump ask, 'So, he's gonna do the investigation?' Ambassador Sondland replied that 'He's gonna do it,' adding that President Zelenskiy will do 'anything you ask him to.'"</p>
      <p>Describing how he could hear the telephone conversation, Mr Holmes said: "While Ambassador Sondland's phone was not on speakerphone, I could hear the president's voice through the earpiece of the phone.</p>
      <p>"The president's voice was very loud and recognisable, and Ambassador Sondland held the phone away from his ear for a period of time, presumably because of the loud volume."</p>
      <p>Mr Holmes said that, after the call, Mr Sondland said the president was in a "bad mood."</p>
      <p>He asked Mr Sondland "if it was true that the president did not 'give a s--- about Ukraine."</p>
      <p>According to Mr Holmes, Mr Sondland replied that the president cared only about "big stuff that benefits the president, like the Biden investigation."</p>
      <p>Gerry Connolly, a Democrat congressman who heard the evidence, said: "Mr. Holmes heard this conversation and recognised the president's voice loud and clear because he was so loud on the phone."</p>
      <p>The existence of the July 26 call only became known publicly on Wednesday when William Taylor, the top US diplomat in Ukraine, gave evidence to the impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <p>He said a member of his staff had brought it to his attention less than a week earlier.</p>
