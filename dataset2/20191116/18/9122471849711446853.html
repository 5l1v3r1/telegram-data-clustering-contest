      <h1>Nick Saban Catching Heat For Keeping Tua Tagovailoa In Too Long</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T18:50:59+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 18:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>Alabama had concerns entering this weekend about Tua Tagovailoa’s ankle. Sure, he played well against LSU last weekend, but he’s still less than a month removed from surgery.</p>
      <p>Many analysts were begging Saban to start Mac Jones at quarterback this afternoon. The Crimson Tide thought Tagovailoa looked solid during warmups, so they ultimately let him start.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa was carted off the field and is reportedly getting an X-ray on his right hip. His helmet flew off during the play, which resulted in him receiving a bloody nose.</p>
      <p>Since Alabama led 35-7 before the injury took place, the entire sports world is bashing Saban for leaving Tagovailoa in the game.</p>
      <p>Here are a few of the posts going viral on Twitter:</p>

      <p>Before he entered the locker room at halftime, Saban <a href="https://twitter.com/jdubs88/status/1195773647883034626">told reporters</a> that he let Tagovailoa play another drive so he could run a two-minute drill.</p>
      <p>Even in the event that Tagovailoa isn’t seriously hurt, there is no chance Alabama plays him again today.</p>
      <p>Now the real concern is whether or not Tagovailoa will be available for the Iron Bowl in two weeks.</p>
