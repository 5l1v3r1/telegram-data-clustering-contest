      <h1>Mauramania hits Dublin shopping centre as hundreds queue to meet Love Island star</h1>
      <h2>Hundreds of diehard tweens and teens queued from 10.30am to see their hero at a one-off Meet and Greet</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T18:55:43+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 18:55</time> by <a rel="author">Michelle Fleming</a></address>
      <p>Mauramania swept Blanchardstown Shopping Centre in Dublin on Saturday and the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/longford">Longford lass</a> even left Santa Claus – who flew in on his chopper – for dust.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of diehard tweens and teens queued from 10.30am to see their <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/love-island">Love Island hero</a> at a one-off Meet and Greet at Ann Summers.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/maura-higgins">A giant Maura</a> poster with the caption: “Be More Maura” gazed out from the window as her fans waited until doors opened at 1pm.</p>
      <p>When the devotees caught a glimpse of her deeply-tanned, teeny tiny frame in the store and the first of them were ushered inside, it was utter bedlam.</p>
      <p>An hour and a zillion selfies later, and Maura’s time was up.</p>

      <p>But there were still around 100 – mainly teenage girls – still to see her.</p>
      <p>As the shrieking mob clamoured around the window, Maura marched out to say hello.</p>
      <p>Some girls hyper-ventilated while others cried real tears.</p>
      <p>They lunged and squealed. Beatlemania had nothing on this.</p>
      <p>“We love you Maura – Oh my GOD – Jesus, MAURA!!”.</p>
      <p>A brave Maura – encircled by panicky-eyed bouncers – even pushed into the stampeding mob so as many as possible could snatch a selfie.</p>
      <p>But there was no hope of a chat with the Queen of Straight-talking.</p>
      <p>Maura’s entourage announced she’d no time for chats.</p>
      <p>Questions could be emailed to her agent and and they’d be answered by Monday.</p>
      <p>Maura was mad to get going. She’d a rare night home in Longford tonight before heading back across the pond for Dancing on Ice rehearsals.</p>

      <p>“I’m back in Longford for one night only,” she revealed. “I have to fly back to London tomorrow as I’m so busy.</p>
      <p>“Back to London where I live – it’s one night only at home.”</p>
      <p>Maura, who is still loved up with her Love Island partner, pro dancer Curtis Pritchard, recently told how she cried after being chased by paparazzs – so how did she feel after today’s stampede?</p>
      <p>“Ah no, they’re not going to harm me – they’re all so sweet,” trilled Maura.</p>
      <p>“They’re all so lovely. And they waiting so long.”</p>
      <p>And 20 minutes later, as Maura mingled and jumped into selfies with shop assistants, the mob hadn’t shrunk.</p>
      <p>Maura was trapped.</p>
      <p>And in true Beatlemania style – and unlike poor Santa – she had to leave by the back door.</p>
