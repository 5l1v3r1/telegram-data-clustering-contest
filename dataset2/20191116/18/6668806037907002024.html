      <p>Excited about the project, Arjun had said in an official statement recently, “I have grown up in a joint family so I understood that it's the biggest pillar of love, strength, and support. That's the essence of our film, which has its heart in the right place.” From what we hear, the film is expected to be a cross border love tale.</p>
