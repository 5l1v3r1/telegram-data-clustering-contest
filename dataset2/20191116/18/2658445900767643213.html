      <p>Former Governor Idris Wada of Kogi has called for adoption of electronic voting system with computerised data base to curb the nation’s flaws in electioneering processes, costs and security challenges.</p>
      <p>Wada, who made the call while addressing newsmen after casting his vote at Odu Ward 4 Unit 001 on Saturday in Ogboyaga, said most of the nation’s electioneering challenges would be a thing of the past with electronic voting put in place.</p>
      <p>He said that the electoral process needed to be organised in a way that there would be minimal human interface.</p>
      <p>“We need to go into electronic voting, computerised data base and so on. So that people do not abuse the process.</p>
      <p>“Because one of the major problems now is that even when you have orderly voting; when you go to the collation centre, thugs will intercept, shoot guns and change the results and it will not reflect the will of the people,” he said.</p>

      <p>On his expectations from the polls, the former governor said, “My expectation is that PDP will win, the situation in our state is very clear to everybody. So, I believe that at the end of the day, PDP will win.</p>
      <p>“The process looks quite orderly here in this polling unit but I have received calls and reports of various misconduct in various polling units.</p>
      <p>“People are snatching ballot boxes, ballots papers, they broke into a Registration Area Center for ward 2 over night and they took away 7 boxes.</p>
      <p>“It is a sad development in our democracy; people should follow an orderly process and allow people to perform their civic responsibility of voting for the candidate of their choice.</p>
      <p>Wada said unless the unhealthy development of people imposing themselves on the people as leaders and disallow a free and fair process stopped, the country would not improve and there would be no development.</p>
      <p>He condemned the wanton destruction of people’s property over election, saying it was not fair to burn the house of a citizen who had laboured all his life to build “simply because you don’t want him to come out and vote”.</p>
