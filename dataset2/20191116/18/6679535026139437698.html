      <p>Members of All India Democratic Women’s Association (AIDWA) submitted a petition to the Superintendent of Police on Saturday demanding fair probe and speedy arrest of accused in the sexual assault of a six-year-old near Omalur here.</p>
      <p>U.Vasuki, vice-president of AIDWA, along with other members of the organisation demanded the officials to conduct probe in accordance with Protection Of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) guidelines.</p>
      <p>Ms. Vasuki visited the girl and her parents at the Salem government hospital. She told presspersons that POCSO guidelines were not followed while investigating the case.</p>
      <h3>Guidelines violated</h3>
      <p>Ms. Vasuki alleged that male police personnel had conducted inquiry with the victim and her kin was not allowed to be with her during the inquiry which was against the guidelines mentioned in POCSO.</p>
      <p>The organisation also demanded speedy arrest of the accused.</p>
      <p>Ms. Vasuki also alleged that there was lack of seriousness on part of the government in preventing such incidents.</p>
