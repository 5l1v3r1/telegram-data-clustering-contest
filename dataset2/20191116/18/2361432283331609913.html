      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T18:38:26+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 18:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thewrap.com/author/jeremy-fuster/" target="_blank">Jeremy Fuster</a></address>
      <p>Bravo is adding a 10th version of their runaway hit reality series “The Real Housewives” that will take place in Salt Lake City, the franchise’s executive producer and host Andy Cohen announced at the network’s first ever BravoCon this weekend.</p>
      <p>“We’ve always tried to choose a city that has completely unique personalities and we also try to throw a little curveball now and then. Pick somewhere you weren’t expecting,” Cohen said.</p>
      <p>“You didn’t see it coming but I have to tell you, in Utah, you have the majesty of the mountains, the Mormon religion, an exclusive community of people who have very successful businesses who live in their own universe,” he added. “It is gorgeous and I think you’re going to be really surprised and intrigued by the group of women we’ve found.”</p>

      <p>Since its launch with “The Real Housewives of Orange County” in 2006, Bravo has launched versions of the show in New York, Atlanta, Beverly Hills and other U.S. cities. Only two versions — Miami and Washington D.C. — have been canceled, while “Orange County” has reached 14 seasons. Other countries have created their versions of the show in places like Sydney, Vancouver, Bangkok, Athens and Johannesburg.</p>

      <p>“‘The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City’ takes viewers into an undiscovered world that is about so much more than religion, although the Mormon church is undeniably ingrained in the culture,” the official announcement of the new series reads. “In the majestic mountains of Utah is a hidden social circle made up of successful women who have created their own paradise filled with luxury homes, shopping sprees and multi-million-dollar businesses and brands.”</p>
      <p>“Here perfection is not an aspiration, it’s a mandate. They hold themselves and each other to an extremely high standard and never hold back when things go sideways, but lord knows they are always there for each other when they need it most.”</p>
      <p>An official premiere date for the show has not been set.</p>

          <figcaption>Miss: Queer Eye for the Straight Girl (2005) Unlike its predecessor, this spinoff didn't present anything new for viewers. What gal doesn't already have a gay bestie to advise her?</figcaption>

          <figcaption>Miss: "Hey Paula" (2007) No one watched Paula Abdul's reality series. But, it's trashtastic reality legend nonetheless. The former Laker Girl was fired from the "Bratz" movie on-screen and later accused Bravo of "creative editing."</figcaption>

          <figcaption>Miss: "Chef Academy" (2009) "Top Chef" had done well for the network. So why not create a show for amateur chefs? Fine idea, but did it have to be so contrived and over the top? One and done.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>Hit and Miss: NYC Prep (2009) This stab at bringing in a younger demo only aired for one season. But it was a well-made show that took its cue from the CW's "Gossip Girl" and continues to be a cult favorite.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>Miss: The Real Housewives of D.C. (2010) The show is best known for White House party crashers Michaele and Tareq Salahai, but the bigger problem was that the women of D.C. society lacked the ability to let their hair down in true "Real Housewives" fashion.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>Miss: 'Love Broker' (2012) Is there room on the network for more than one matchmaker? The viewers voted no. After poor ratings, Bravo pulled "Love Broker" off its spring schedule and then burned off the episodes during the summer.</figcaption>
