      <p>There was such a demand for winter coats last weekend at the season’s first “Coats 4 Kids” giveaway that organizers of the annual event hit a one-day record by distributing more than 5,200 free coats to local kids in need.</p>
      <p>It was such a success, in fact, there probably aren’t enough coats left to meet the demand anticipated for the two remaining events coming up.</p>
      <p>That’s where you come in.</p>
      <p>Paul Billoni, longtime owner of the family-run Colvin Cleaners and the force behind Coats 4 Kids, put out another plea to the Western New York community on Saturday, asking it to dig deeper through the closets and storage bins for more gently used kids’ coats.</p>
      <p>Colvin Cleaners for the first time is also accepting cash donations that will be used to purchase new coats.</p>
      <p>“At this point, it’s very likely that we will not have enough coats for every child who comes through the door at our next two distributions. Having a winter coat for every child has always been our mission with this project,” Christopher Billoni, vice president of Colvin Cleaners, said in a prepared statement.</p>
      <p>“We gave away more coats in the first hour last week than we did in three hours last year,” he said. “And while the families were appreciative, we were overwhelmed by the number of people in this community who came in need of coats and winter accessories.”</p>
      <p>Those coats came in the nick of time.</p>
      <p>An early dose of winter hit the region last week, bringing a storm that dropped more than 11 inches at the Buffalo Niagara International Airport and setting a new record for Nov. 11.</p>
      <p>“I think the early cold had people thinking more about winter than before,” said Mike Billoni, Paul’s brother, who handles public relations for the event.</p>
      <p>The run on coats also shows the bigger issue of poverty in the region, he said, particularly among the large number of refugees and immigrants to Buffalo in recent years.</p>
      <p>Coats 4 Kids, now in its 24th year, ran its first distribution event of the season from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Nov. 9 at the Knights of Columbus in Kenmore. Families started lining up at 6 a.m.</p>
      <p>“Our eyes were moist all day as family after family came up to all of us offering thanks for their coats, gloves, scarves and hats and telling us if it wasn’t for this program, they would not have a winter coat,” Mike Billoni said.</p>
      <p>The next distribution is from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Nov. 23 at True Bethel Church, 907 E. Ferry St.</p>
      <p>A third event will run from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Dec. 7 at the Belle Center, 104 Maryland St.</p>
      <p>The Billoni family is hopeful the community will come through again, just as it has in the past.</p>
      <p>Donations of coats, gloves, hats, scarves and boots can be made at Colvin Cleaners, 2375 Elmwood Ave., Kenmore, 14127 or at many of the area’s Allstate Insurance agencies.</p>
