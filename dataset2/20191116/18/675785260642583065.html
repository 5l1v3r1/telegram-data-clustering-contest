      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Ben Wilson's dad, Craig, was left in a coma after he was hit eight times but Ben was given a reduced sentence of six years after the judge considered provocation by his 'Jekyl and Hyde' dad who was described as a “violent nasty drunk”</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T18:04:19+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 18:04</time> by <a rel="author">Rosaleen Fenton, Grace Macaskill</a></address>
      <p>Ben Wilson sits in the living room of the home he shares with his mother and reflects on the brutal attack on his Jekyll and Hyde dad that has ruined his life.</p>
      <p>And after his release from prison, he says firmly and calmly: “I’d do the same again.</p>
      <p>“I sacrificed myself to save my mam. I thought if I have to do prison for the rest of my life for my family, then I’m going to do it.”</p>
      <p>Ben was just 22 when he snapped after nearly a decade of seeing drunken father Craig regularly beating his mother Tracey.</p>
      <p>Growing up, he had watched in horror as booze turned the dad he loved into a monster, threatening to kill his family and himself.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Then one night, after a birthday party for his mother turned sour, Ben could take no more.</p>
      <p>When his dad threatened to “chop up” Tracey with a six-inch kitchen knife, his son hit him eight times with a lump hammer.</p>
      <p>The attack left Craig, 47, in a coma with brain damage and Ben facing a long prison sentence.</p>
      <p>But the years of terror the family had faced, Ben’s good character and his guilty plea led to a judge giving him the lowest jail term possible – six years.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>And even that caused a public outcry, with 55,000 people signing a petition for his release.</p>
      <p>Now free after four years, and speaking for the first time about his family’s ordeal, Ben remains haunted by what he did.</p>
      <p>He even believes he’s responsible for his dad’s suicide at 47 in November 2016 – just as they were being reconciled.</p>
      <p>But there was little he could do to stop the explosion that ended his family’s years of abuse. “I used to worry every night thinking ‘What will he do next?’,” says Ben.</p>

      <p>“You can’t wake up thinking, ‘am I going to die today or is mam going to die today?’ I was on edge.</p>
      <p>“My dad was my best mate, but when he had a drink he was the devil. Before that I had a brilliant childhood. We’d go on holidays to Turkey and Ibiza.</p>
      <p>“But he got depressed after his dad died when I was about 13. He’d drink, mam would challenge him and the rows would start. It became the norm.”</p>
      <p>The bust-ups led to Craig throttling Tracey so hard on New Year’s Eve, 2007, “her eyes were popping out”, says Ben. His dad got two years jail for the attack.</p>

      <p>After release, Craig would still regularly hit Tracey.</p>
      <p>Ben claims police were frequently called but said: “They did f*** all.</p>
      <p>"No matter how many times we cried for help, it wouldn’t happen. I’d hear arguments and my coping mechanism was to walk out.</p>
      <p>"I’d seen the chunks taken out of mam’s head. One time he hit her onto a worktop. There was blood all over.</p>
      <p>"Another time he told me ‘I’m going to f***ing strangle her’ before going into mam’s room.</p>
      <p>"I hit him in the back with a hoover wand. He stopped, then pulled out a kitchen knife and whipped his arm. He covered it with a towel and went to hospital.</p>

      <p>“He used to say, ‘I’m going to kill myself’. I’d think, ‘just f***ing do it’.”</p>
      <p>The night of the attack in May, 2014, Craig had downed a bottle of Sambuca at Tracey’s birthday barbecue.</p>
      <p>“We’d been playing a game, then dad picked up a knife saying, ‘I’m going to cut you all up and kill you all’. He went upstairs and smashed things. Mam followed. I heard screaming.</p>

        <figcaption>Following the attack police interviewed Ben for three days and refused to tell him whether his dad was alive or dead (Image: Andy Commins / Daily Mirror)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>“I picked up a hammer from my toolbag and went up. He said ‘what the f*** are you doing, you creepy ****, what’s behind your back? I belted him on the temple.</p>
      <p>“I hit him eight times supposedly. I only remember once. I didn’t want to kill him.”</p>
      <p>Panicked, Ben ran from the house and cycled to the police station.</p>
      <p>He says: “My tracksuit and trainers were covered in blood. I went to the desk and said, ‘I’ve just killed my dad’.”</p>
      <p>Police interviewed him for three days. He says they refused to tell him whether his father was alive.</p>

      <p>“I was distraught. I had just wanted to make him stop. My life was ruined but I thought ‘at least I’ve done it for my family’.”</p>
      <p>Ben was jailed for grievous bodily harm in January, 2015.</p>
      <p>But the judge took into account Ben’s previous good character, the year’s he’d dealt with his father’s abusive nature and his guilty plea and gave Ben the lowest sentence.</p>
      <p>Now he wants all judges to be lenient with those shielding loved ones from domestic violence.</p>
      <p>He said: “The law should state you’re defending a family member.”</p>
      <p>His plight echoes the case of Sally Challen, 65, – jailed for life in 2011 after killing abusive husband Richard, 61, with a hammer.</p>
      <p>Her conviction was quashed this year. Ben says she “deserved to go to prison” but not for life.</p>

      <p>He said: “In my mind, the law should state that you’re defending a family member.</p>
      <p>“You’re defending a loved one which I think anyone in their right mind in the same circumstances, would do the same thing.</p>
      <p>“I know it doesn’t justify what I did but at the same time, it was a sacrifice. I think it’s hard to judge unless you’re in that situation yourself.”</p>
      <p>He says the counsellors he has been offered in prison, didn’t help him.</p>
      <p>But he thinks all victims of domestic violence who end up in prison should be enrolled in specific programmes where they can share their experiences with each other.</p>

      <p>Since leaving prison, the heavily tattooed 27-year-old who has LOVE LIFE emblazoned across his knuckles, says he has received messages from fellow witnesses of domestic abuse praising him for his actions.</p>
      <p>Ben had been rebuilding his relationship with his dad Craig while he served time in Durham prison - but his dad took his own life before Ben was released.</p>
      <p>“We were writing letters and I was hoping we could get some sort of bond back. His last one said ‘can’t wait to see you kiddo’.</p>
      <p>"</p>
      <p>A few days later mam visited me in tears. She said dad killed himself. When I went back to my cell I took the sink off the wall and flooded the place. I went daft with grief. I feel like a monster because I think I forced him to kill himself."</p>
      <p>Ben was allowed out of jail to attend his father's funeral.</p>
      <p>"His ashes are in the back garden. His spirit is still here," he says.</p>
      <p>Now he's trying to rebuild his life at the family home in Billingham, Stockton-on-Tees, since his release six months ago.</p>
      <p>He holds on to the happier memories he had with his dad.</p>
      <p>"When mam came to the police station to get me I said 'I'm sorry'. I told her everything was going to change because of what I'd done.</p>

      <p>“We’ve never spoken about that night again,” says Ben now on medication for anxiety.</p>
      <p>He added: “It’s ruined so much of my life. But if I hadn’t stepped in she might not be here today.”</p>
      <p>Cleveland Police confirmed they had attended Ben’s home several times before the attack.</p>
      <p>A spokesman said the force was “extremely sorry” the family felt let down – and that officers were now better trained in recognising domestic violence risk and harm indicators.</p>
