      <h1>Liverpool sweating on fitness of four key players ahead of Crystal Palace clash</h1>
      <h2>Liverpool could be without a number of important players after the international break as they bid to keep their unbeaten start to the Premier League campaign</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T10:20:21+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 10:20</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp will be hoping for no more injuries as he sweats on the fitness of four players.</p>
      <p>Premier League leaders <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> return to action after the international break against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> as they bid to continue their unbeaten start.</p>
      <p>Last weekend's victory over champions <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> opened up a nine-point lead on Pep Guardiola's side.</p>
      <p>But the international break has not been kind to Klopp, who also had injury concerns after the win over City.</p>
      <p>Mohamed Salah aggravated his ankle problem in the victory at Anfield, having picked up the knock against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> .</p>

      <p>He reported to duty with Egypt but scans ruled him out of their matches with Kenya and Comoros.</p>
      <p>And worrying images emerged of Salah wearing a protective boot as he watched his international teammates in training.</p>
      <p>Left-back Andy Robertson also pulled out of the Scotland squad for their final Euro 2020 qualifiers.</p>
      <p>Robertson also has an ankle problem and admitted this week he hadn't trained for over two weeks.</p>

      <p>"Iâ€™ve had to listen to the people around me when previously I would have told them to beat it. The fact my ankle has swollen up again has made it easier to miss these games," Robertson said.</p>
      <p>He is now a doubt for the clash with Palace and on Saturday it was revealed Jordan Henderson and Joe Gomez had been withdrawn from the England squad.</p>
      <p>Gomez, who was involved in a clash with Raheem Sterling this week, injured his knee in a training challenge with Kieran Trippier.</p>
      <p>Skipper Henderson missed England's win over Montenegro and a virus has now meant he has pulled out ahead of the trip to Kosovo.</p>

      <p>Liverpool have already been without Joel Matip and Xherdan Shaqiri to injury.</p>
      <p>Matip was ruled out by Jurgen Klopp earlier this month with a knee problem, with the Liverpool boss confirming he would miss "the next few weeks".</p>
      <p>Shaqiri meanwhile has not played since the defeat to Napoli in September but could return to training next week.</p>
