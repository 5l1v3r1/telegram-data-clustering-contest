      <p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres announced that the United Nations would investigate the attacks in early August, following the UN Security Council pushing for an inquiry.</p>
      <blockquote>"The commission is investigating seven incidents of [airstrikes on  facilities] in northwest Syria, of which three are in Idlib [province]", the sources said.</blockquote>
      <p>A source specified that the<a href="https://sputniknews.com/interviews/201911091077263908-syrias-idlib-still-has-over-10000-terrorists--un-monitoring-team/"> airstrikes in Idlib dealt with an attack on humanitarian sites</a> like hospitals and health centres, which had been included on a deconfliction list and shared with the warring parties in order to protect the sites and civilians.</p>

      <p>In mid-October, the UN said it would deliver the report about its findings in three months, but would not publish them.</p>
      <p>The Russian Foreign Ministry has described the UN probe as provocative in nature, saying that it was <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201911141077308141-us-looting-syria-under-pretext-of-securing-oil-fields-russian-general/">promoted by countries that are hostile to the Syrian government</a> and the joint counterterrorism efforts it has undertaken with Russia.</p>
      <p>The inquiry was requested by 10 UN Security Council member states — Belgium, France, Germany, the Dominican Republic, Indonesia, Kuwait, Peru, Poland, the United Kingdom and the United States.</p>
