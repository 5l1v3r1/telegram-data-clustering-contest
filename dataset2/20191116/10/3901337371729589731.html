      <p>Mhlongo has entered into the last year of his contract with Lidoda Duvha, with his existing deal set to expire in June next year.</p>
      <p>In recent weeks, the 29-year-old has been linked with a number of clubs in Mzansi’s topflight, including AmaZulu, Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates.</p>
      <p>However, indications are that Leopards view the player as an integral part of their team and want to keep him.</p>
      <p>Mhlongo’s representative, Ratshibvumo Mulovhedzi, confirmed to the Siya crew that negotiations between the player’s camp and Leopards have been initiated.</p>
      <p>“As I speak to you, I am talking to Black Leopards about Joseph Mhlongo and the negotiations are progressing well. We are negotiating about a new contract and we are getting there,” confirmed the representative.</p>

      <p>“Yes, we have not yet finalised, but we are getting there. The club gave us their offer and we have made them our counter-offer. They are in the process of making a decision and we are waiting for them,” concluded Mulovhedzi.  </p>
