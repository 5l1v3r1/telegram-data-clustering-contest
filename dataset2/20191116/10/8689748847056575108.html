      <p>Wednesday, November 13, 2019 can’t be easily forgotten in the life of <a href="http://www.ghbase.com/13-years-on-in-acting-and-nothing-to-boast-of-apart-from-the-fame-actor-kwame-borga/">Kumawood actor Kwame Borga</a> as his mother’s house was consumed by unquenchable fire at the blind side of those living in the house.</p>
      <p>The unfortunate incident happened at Pankrono – <b>Atimatim New Site specifically “Mmaa dodoɔ junction”</b> where the house is being located. Per our checks and series of consultations, the ultimate cause of the fire relatively remains unknown, however, an element of either gas cylinder or electric iron explosion can’t be ignored.</p>
      <p>Although items worth millions have been lost as a result of the unfortunate incident, but the good news is <b>that no human life was lost as all those living in the house at the time of the explosion were able to escape unhurt</b>. It’s worth knowing that Ghana Fire Service were called to come to rescue the situation but their delayance as usual didn’t help.</p>
