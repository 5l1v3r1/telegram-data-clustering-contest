      <p>The most flexible controller option for Google's upcoming <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/google-stadia-app-play-store-red-dead-2-borderlands-3-cyberpunk-2077">Stadia cloud gaming</a> service is the company's own Stadia Controller, which is available in Clearly White, Just Black, and Wasabit color options (each one is priced at $69). As Stadia's launch day fast approaches, Google has posted a comprehensive guide on how to use the controller.<br/><br/><a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/google">Google</a> also posted a guide on setting up the <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/google-stadia-controller-details">Stadia Controller</a>. To do that, you need to have the Stadia app installed on your mobile device. The app uses Location access, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth to find and configure the controller, and if any of those are turned off when setting it up, you will be asked to turn them on.</p>
      <h3>How To Set Up Google's Stadia Controller</h3>
      <p>Here are the steps...</p>
      <ol>
        <li>To turn on your Stadia Controller, hold down the <b>Stadia button</b> for two seconds until it vibrates.</li>
        <li>On your mobile device, open the <b>Stadia app</b>.</li>
        <li>Tap the <b>Controller icon</b> in the upper-right corner.</li>
        <li>If prompted, enable <b>location access, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth</b> on your mobile device.</li>
        <li>Select your controller from the list.</li>
        <li>The controller will vibrate to make sure the right controller is being set up. When the controller starts vibrating, tap <b>Yes</b> and then <b>Continue</b>.</li>
        <li>Tap <b>Connect to [network name]</b> to connect your controller to the same Wi-Fi network that your phone is connected to. If you want to connect your Stadia Controller to a different network tap <b>Choose a different network</b>.</li>
        <li>Enter your <b>Wi-Fi password</b> and then tap <b>Connect to Wi-Fi</b> and then <b>Done</b>.</li>
        <li>Your controller will download and install an update. You don’t need to wait for the update to finish before continuing. Tap OK.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>To play games on a TV using a Chromecast Ultra, a PC using Google Chrome, or a mobile device, you will need to link the controller to one of those devices.</p>
      <h3>Google Stadia Controller Buttons And Controls</h3>
      <p>Google's support document includes a few handy diagrams that outline the controls on the Stadia Controller. Here's a look...</p>

      <p>The dedicated Stadia button acts as both a Status Light and a multi-purpose button. Pressing and holding it down for 1 second (until the controller vibrates) turns on Stadia. Once it's own, tapping the Stadia button opens up the Stadia menu, and holding it down for 1 second opens the platform menu. To turn the controller off, you would hold the Stadia button for 4 seconds, or 8 seconds for a hard power down.<br/><br/>"Doing this can be useful as a hard reset procedure if the controller were to become unresponsive. The controller may be turned back on with a 1 second press of the Stadia button," Google explains.<br/><br/>Here's what the four other unique buttons do...<br/><b>Menu</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Access in-game menu</li>
        <li>Pause supported games</li>
        <li>May be used differently in some games</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Options</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Access in-game menu options menu</li>
        <li>Pause supported games</li>
        <li>May be used differently in some games</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Assistant</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Talk to the Google Assistant<br/>Note: You don't need to keep holding the button while you speak.<br/>Note: You must have Google Assistant enabled in your Stadia account to use Google Assistant on your controller.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Capture</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Press to save a screenshot</li>
        <li>Hold to save a clip</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As for the status light, there are four statuses it might display. When it's <b>blinking white</b>, the controller is ready for you to enter the linking code. When it's <b>solid white</b>, the controller is on, linked, and ready to play. <b>Blinking orange</b> means it needs to be set up with Wi-Fi, and a <b>solid orange</b> light means it is charging (it will turn off when fully charged).<br/><br/>Most everything else is rather straightforward—it has A, B, X, and Y buttons, along with left and right bumpers and triggers, a directional pad (D-pad), and two analog thumbsticks. Fairly standard stuff on a modern controller. You can hit the link in the Via field below to read more about each one.<br/><br/>If you don't want to use the Stadia Controller, Google has <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/google-stadia-compatibility-ps4-xbox-nintendo-switch-controllers">outlined support</a> for various other popular controller options, including Sony's <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/dualshock-4">DualShock 4</a>, Microsoft's Xbox One controller, and Nintendo's <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/steam-client-beta-supports-switch-pro-controller">Switch Pro</a>.<br/><br/><a href="https://hothardware.com/news/google-stadia-documents">Stadia launches on November 19</a> in 14 different territories. It will have a <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/google-stadia-launch-titles">dozen games on day-one</a>, all of which Stadia Pro subscribers will be able to access for no additional charge (beyond the subscription fee).</p>
