      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/GarethSouthgate">Gareth Southgate</a> has hailed <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/harry-winks">Harry Winks</a>’ ability to “connect defence to attack very well” as the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/TottenhamHotspur">Tottenham</a> midfielder establishes himself with <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/england-football-0">England</a>.</p>
      <p>Winks has not been an automatic starter for Spurs this season, but Southgate has handed him a key role in recent internationals.</p>
      <p>Winks was the pivot for the Three Lions in the 7-0 win over Montenegro and Southgate has explained why he covets his qualities so much.</p>
      <p>“He’s in that category of a very good footballer who can connect defence to attack very well,” Soutgate explained.</p>
      <p>“There’ll obviously be tougher tests in terms of counter-attacks against us and needing to fill defensive spaces.</p>
      <p>“He’s finding himself out of Tottenham’s team. So, that’s an interesting challenge as well but I couldn’t be happier with what he’s done in Bulgaria and again tonight.</p>
      <p>“In fact, his performances for us in Spain and Lithuania from the very first ball, he has always played consistently well.”</p>
      <p>Winks will likely continue to operate at the base of the midfield against Kosovo before turning attention to winning over Mauricio Pochettino, with Spurs facing West Ham next Saturday.</p>
