      <h2>The Met Office say Newcastle and the North East will see relatively mild, damp weather this week but the long term forecast predicts some snow and ice</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T10:29:33+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 10:29</time> by <a rel="author">Hannah Graham</a></address>
      <p>It's set to be a week of fog, rain and relatively mild temperatures - but things might become more wintry soon.</p>
      <p>According to the Met Office, this weekend is set to be fairly warm for the time of year, but beset by rain.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, those hoping to catch a first glimpse at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/christmas-market">Newcastle's Christmas Market</a> will be met with cloud and outbreaks of rain, which will be heavy at times. A cool northeasterly breeze will keep things feeling fairly chilly, but the maximum temperature is a relatively balmy 9 °C.</p>
      <p>A "cloudy and damp night" will bring mist and fog patches.</p>
      <p>Sunday will see more cloud, with the risk of further light rain or drizzle, but the possibility of sunnier spells and less breeze. The maximum temperature will be 10 °C.</p>
      <p>But looking further into the future, Met Office forecasters say things could become somewhat wintrier as November develops.</p>
      <p>Next week, weather systems pushing into the UK will make conditions rainy, with strong winds making warmer temperatures feel cold.</p>
      <p>And, a spokesperson said: "There is a greater than normal chance of overnight fog forming in any clearer spells overnight, which could be slow to clear in places.</p>
      <p>"The showers may continue to be wintry over the highest ground bringing some sleet or snow at times."</p>
      <p>Temperatures will be average or slightly above for the time of year. And between November 30 and December 14, rain will become less likely - but frost, as well as the unpleasant-sounding "freezing fog" may start to appear.</p>
      <p>Temperatures are expected to be around average, or just above, for the time of year.</p>
