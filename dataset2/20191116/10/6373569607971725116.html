      <p>There are calls for a new fleet of £250 million British warships to be based at Plymouth.</p>
      <p>Yesterday Babcock International revealed it has been awarded a contract by the UK Ministry of Defence to deliver its newest fleet Type 31 general-purpose frigates.</p>
      <p>The programme will provide the UK with a fleet of five ships, at an average production cost of £250 million per ship.</p>
      <p>The formal contract award follows the announcement earlier this year that Babcock's Team 31 had been selected as preferred bidder following a competitive process.</p>

      <p>Babcock's says its Arrowhead 140 is a "capable, adaptable and technology-enabled global frigate with a proven design and build strategy".</p>
      <p>Although the ships themselves will be assembled at Babcock's Rosyth facility, they will involve supply chains throughout the UK, in line with the UK's shipbuilding strategy.</p>
      <p>And Labour General Election candidate Luke Pollard has called for the ships to be based at Plymouth once they have been built.</p>
      <p>In a tweet he said: "Good news! I argued that Babcock’s bid was the best value and now the contract has been signed let’s push on to get these ships built.</p>
      <p>"And when they’re built let’s have them based in Devonport. Another argument I’ve been making consistently as Devonport’s MP and now too."</p>
