      <h3>A TRANSPORT group yesterday urged the Land Transportation Office (LTO) to explain why electric tricycles or e-trikes are categorized as “toys” following their rampant operation without legal documents.</h3>
      <p>In a letter to the LTO, Sta. Ana Transport Service Cooperative chairperson Eduardo Pelaez stressed that e-trikes are operating illegally because of  absence of legal documents or franchise, causing traffic and endangering the lives of passengers.</p>
      <p>“Bakit po kamo delikado? ‘Unang-una, wala silang legal franchise from the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), pangalawa wala rin silang Compulsary Third Party Liability (CTPL) at Pessenger Insurance na nire-require ng LTFRB sang-ayon sa batas kaya vulnerable  ang safety ng mga pasahero nito. In short, talagang illegal ang operation nila kaya dapat hulihin at impound ang mga ito dahil delikado at nawawala ‘yung essence ng gobyerno na safety first,” the transport group said.  </p>
      <p>The group also called the attention of LTO-LTFRB, PNP-Highway Patrol Group and all local government to apprehend and impound e-trikes illegally operating in Manila and nearby areas.</p>
      <p>“Alam namin naghahanap buhay din ang mga driver na ito pero dapat linawin ng DOTr-LTO-LTFBR, bago sila mag-operate kung legal ba sila o hindi dahil hindi maganda at nasasapanganib ang buhay ng mga inosenteng commuters,” said Pelaez.</p>
