      <p>A few days ago, Motorola released the Razr flip phone which comes with a foldable display. The Motorola Razr is more like the 2004 Razr V3 with new technology. Thus, this new phone brought a lot of memories back to users. In the early Android years, the likes of Motorola and HTC were on top of their game. These companies have really old devices that were a hit back in the day. With the successful launch of Motorola Razr, <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/HTC">HTC</a> wants to tow the same line – bring back an old device with new technologies.</p>

      <p>Drew Bamford, the current head of HTC Creative Labs, asked a very interesting question on Twitter, “Which classic @htc phone would you like to see us bring back with today’s technology?”. This suggests that HTC wants to re-enact an old mobile phone. Which one will you like to see?</p>

      <h3>HTC One X</h3>
      <p>In this regard, comments from netizens seem to suggest HTC One X. The One X is the first generation of HTC’s product line. It comes with a 4.7-inch SLCD 2 “Giant Screen” at the time and uses the world’s first quad-core processor, NVIDIA Tegra 3. It uses an Ester material seamless body design with a frosted surface.</p>

      <h3>HTC One M7</h3>
      <p>In addition, HTC One M7 seems to also get the nod of netizens. This model is the second product after the boutique project. It uses a metal body design that was extremely rare at the time, and the excellent double speakers on the front panel. The biggest controversy for this phone is the huge chin and the 4MP rear camera. The One M7 is the last HTC phone with built-in Beats sound and a standard Beats headset. So, if the company wants to re-enact a classic model of the year with today’s hardware and technology, which one do you want to see?</p>
