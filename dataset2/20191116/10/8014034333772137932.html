      <p>BEIRUT — Syrian opposition activists say a car bomb has killed at least 12 people in a northern town controlled by Turkey-backed opposition fighters.</p>
      <p>The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that 14 people, including nine civilians, were killed Saturday in the town of al-Bab.</p>
      <p>The Aleppo Media Center, an activist collective, said 12 people were killed in the blast near a bus station in the town.</p>
      <p>Different casualty figures are common in the immediate aftermath of explosions.</p>
      <p>No one claimed responsibility for the attack.</p>
      <p>Explosions have killed and wounded scores of people in Turkish-held areas of northeastern Syria in recent months.</p>
      <p>Those attacks have come amid an expanding Turkish invasion of Syrian Kurdish-held towns and villages along a stretch of the border.</p>
