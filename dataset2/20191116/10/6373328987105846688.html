      <h1>Nicolas Cage Is In Talks To Star In A Movie Where He Plays Nicolas Cage</h1>

        <b>Nicolas Cage is set to play Nicolas Cage in a satire about Niccolas Cage. </b>
      </p>
      <p>Since 2006, when the world bore witness to ‘Not the bees!’, the wild and wacky actor has mainly starred in low-budget, outside efforts: from <i>Kick-Ass</i> and <i>Drive Angry</i> to <a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/featured/unilads-top-100-films-of-the-decade/"><i>Mandy</i></a> and <i>Colour out of Space</i>.</p>
      <p>However, <i>The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent</i> is set to be his most meta project to date, with the <i>National Treasure </i>playing himself.</p>

      <p>Lionsgate beat out other distributors – such as HBO Max and Paramount – for the film, which has a script by Tom Gormican and Kevin Etten, with Gormican attached to direct, according to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/nicolas-cage-star-as-nicolas-cage-unbearable-weight-massive-talent-1254626"><i>The Hollywood Reporter</i></a>.</p>
      <p>All things going well with contracts, Cage would play a fictionalised version of himself who’s ‘desperate to get a role in a new Quentin Tarantino movie while also dealing with a strained relationship with his teenage daughter’.</p>

      <p>Throughout the film, he’d also talk to an ‘egotistical 1990s version of himself who rides him for making too many crappy movies and for not being a star anymore’.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The film would then go in even more bizarre directions: </b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>The Cage character is also under a mountain of debt and finds himself forced to make an appearance at the birthday party of a Mexican billionaire who happens to be a fan of Cage’s work and secretly hopes to show him a script on which he’s been working.<br/><br/>While he bonds with the man, Cage is informed by the CIA that the billionaire is actually a drug cartel kingpin who has kidnapped the daughter of a Mexican presidential nominee and is recruited by the US government to get intelligence.<br/><br/>The situation spirals even more dramatically when the Mexican brings over Cage’s daughter and his ex-wife for a reconciliation, and when their lives are on the line, Cage takes on the role of a lifetime.</blockquote>
      <p>There’s a whole lot to digest there. It almost feels in the same spirit as Danny Trejo’s cult-favourite <i>Machete</i>, and is set to have nods to Cage’s <i>Leaving Las Vegas, Face-Off </i>and<i> Gone in 60 Seconds. </i></p>

      <p>There’s also shades of <i>Adaptation</i>, Jean-Claude Van Damme’s meta <i>JCVD</i>, and John Travolta’s showbiz comedy <i>Get Shorty. </i></p>
      <p>Cage reportedly received a letter from Gormican outlining why the project was a love letter to the actor’s legacy, rather than a mocking exercise. Cage allegedly loved it, and could even earn a paycheck as high as his <i>Con Air</i> days.</p>

      <p>Kevin Turen, who produced upcoming A24 drama <i>Waves</i> and worked on HBO’s <i>Euphoria</i>, will also reportedly produce with Cage and his Saturn Films banner along with Mike Nilon.</p>
