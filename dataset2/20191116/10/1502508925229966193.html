      <p>Demand for flexible workspace in India is estimated to jump five times by 2025 to 130-140 million sq ft, accounting for one-third of global <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/coworking">coworking </a>inventory, according to a report by property consultant Cushman &amp; Wakefield (C&amp;W).</p>
      <p>The global real estate consultant released its report 'Redefining future workplaces at Workplace Trend Conclave held here on Friday.</p>
      <p>"The phenomenon of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/coworking">coworking </a>has been the proverbial storm in the teacup for commercial real estate in India," the report said.</p>
      <p>India is one of the largest flexible workplace markets in the world, the NYSE-listed consultant said.</p>
      <p>"The rise of millennials has led to the existence of a strong start-up and entrepreneurial culture. They need a workplace that inspires innovation and ideas, offers flexibility in terms of timings and location, while being integrated with technology for communication and collaboration," said Anshul Jain, Country Head &amp; Managing Director-India, C&amp;W.</p>
      <p>The consultant has estimated the global flexible workspace inventory at about 125 million sq ft, of which nearly 27 million sq ft is located in India.</p>
      <p>There are 1,000 operational <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/coworking">coworking </a>centres, with a capacity of over 4 lakh seats, across top six cities -- Delhi-NCR, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad and Chennai.</p>
      <p>The number of flexible space operators has risen from single digits to about 350 over the last 3-4 years.</p>
      <p>"Flex space is likely to grow to 130-140 million sq ft by 2025, with India accounting for nearly one third of the global coworking inventory," the report said.</p>
      <p>The number of operational coworking centres will more than double over the next five years, it added.</p>
      <p>C&amp;W estimated user base of flexible workspaces to jump 10 times to nearly 3 million by 2025.</p>
      <p>At present, 65-70 per cent of demand for coworking spaces comes from large corporates, 15-20 per cent from small &amp; medium enterprises and 10-15 per cent from freelancers and startups.</p>
      <p>"As the trend gains momentum, there are now tangible changes to occupier portfolios and growth strategies, workplace design trends and above all the emergence of using space as a service and not a commodity anymore," the report said.</p>
      <p>Cushman &amp; Wakefield is a leading global real estate services firm, with 48,000 employees in about 400 offices and 70 countries. In 2017, the firm had revenue of $ 6.9 billion.</p>
