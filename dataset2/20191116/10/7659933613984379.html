      <p>Iraq welcomed on Thursday the continued international efforts to combat ISIS, said Foreign Minister Mohammed Ali al-Hakim.<br/><br/>He expressed Iraq’s appreciation for the member states of the US-led Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.<br/><br/>He was speaking at a meeting for the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS Small Group. The event was held less than a month after ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was killed in a US raid in Syria.<br/><br/>Hakim praised coalition efforts to restore stability, offer basic services to liberated Iraqi cities, return refugees back to their homes and back reconstruction.<br/><br/>He also thanked the NATO mission for its role in boosting security capacities and training.<br/><br/>He further commended intelligence efforts exerted by the Iraqi National Intelligence Service and its key role in the operation that lead to Baghdadi’s death.<br/><br/>“Cooperation, intelligence sharing and high-level coordination among coalition countries have resulted in locating and eliminating the ISIS leader,” he said.<br/><br/>The minister stressed “the importance of bolstering the work and unifying international efforts to reach a political solution to the crisis in Syria that ensures its unity and sovereignty,” highlighting its direct impact on regional security and stability.<br/><br/>Moreover, called for “addressing the humanitarian situation of families in the al-Hol displacement camp in Syria and preventing ISIS from infiltrating such camps, spreading its terrorist ideology and reorganizing its ranks.”<br/><br/>He said Iraq was ready to receive Iraqi families from these camps after carrying out the necessary security checks and ensuring they are of Iraqi origins.<br/><br/>Hakim urged the coalition states to assist in the process of transferring these families and developing reintegration and rehabilitation programs.<br/><br/>“Iraq urges coalition states to assume their responsibilities, receive their citizens and ensure that those involved are held accountable.”</p>
