      <p>Lorance’s release from the U.S. Penitentiary in Leavenworth came six years he was convicted of second-degree murder.</p>
      <p>The officer, a 34-year-old native of Oklahoma, was six years into serving a 19-year sentence at Fort Leavenworth for ordering his soldiers to open fire and kill three men in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/afghanistan/index.html">Afghanistan</a>. Lorence’s supporters say he killed Taliban fighters. Nine members of his unit testified against him, saying the men were innocent.</p>
      <p>On Friday, U.S. Rep. Michael Waltz, R-Fla., posted a Twitter message celebrating Trump’s decision regarding Lorance.</p>

      <p>“Earlier this year, I requested a closer look into the serious irregularities in Army Lieutenant Clint Lorance’s case,” Waltz wrote. “Glad to see this news. Thank you, @realDonaldTrump!”</p>

      <p>Also on Friday, President Trump granted clemency to Maj. Matt Golsteyn, a former Green Beret, who will have a murder charge against him dropped.</p>
      <p>Golsteyn was charged with premeditated murder in the 2010 death of a suspected <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/terrorism">Taliban</a> bomb maker. His trial was expected to begin next month.</p>

      <p>The president also restored <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military/navy">Navy SEAL</a> Eddie Gallagher to the rank of chief petty officer after he was docked a pay grade following his conviction for posing with a dead <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/terrorism">Islamic State</a> (ISIS) fighter.</p>
      <p>Gallagher, a 15-year SEAL whose case garnered national attention, was found not guilty of murdering an <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/terrorism/isis">ISIS</a> fighter in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/iraq">Iraq</a> in 2017 but was convicted in July of the lesser charge of posing for the photo.</p>
