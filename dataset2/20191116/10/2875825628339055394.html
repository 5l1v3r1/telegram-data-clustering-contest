      <p><b>Artem Lobov told Sporting News:</b> "Number one, preparing for the first fight, I was doing it blindfolded.</p>
      <p>"I didn’t know what to expect because I had never tried it before. I couldn’t train properly because I didn’t know anyone who did bare-knuckle. So my preparation was a little wrong in terms of my cardio work in getting ready for the two-minute rounds.</p>
      <p>"What I was doing was incorrect. I was preparing for a marathon, and the fight was a sprint. I had it all wrong. This time around, I completely changed my preparation.</p>
      <p>"Being able to train nothing but boxing for a full year made me a much better boxer as I brought in professional boxers helped me make a lot of gains. I look forward to showing the world what I’ve been working on."</p>

      <p><b>Jason Knight speaking to MMA Fighting about the first fight:</b> “My game plan went out the window. I trained a lot better than I fought. I didn’t plan on throwing looping ass punches and trying to knock him out with every shot, but that’s what happened.</p>
      <p>“We went to war. We both got cut up bad. We both got dropped a few times. More or less, we underestimated each other.”</p>
      <h3>Betting odds</h3>
      <p>Artem Lobov win: 1/3</p>
      <p>Jason Knight win: 2/1</p>
      <p>Draw: 16/1</p>
