      <p>R&amp;B diva Ashanti rocked social media recently with a very sexy outfit, and fans have Tory Lanez to thank for that.</p>
      <p>Lanez recently dropped a <i>Chixtape 5</i> project, which featured songs from the 2000s R&amp;B era. The project includes Ashanti’s “Foolish,” T-Pain’s “I’m Sprung,” and Chris Brown’s “Take You Down.”</p>
      <p>Lanez spoke about <i>Chixtape</i> to <i>Billboard</i> and said this: “Everything is 2000s-inspired. Everything is inspired by the times when things were golden for us. I think all those pieces and everything that we’ve come out with has been all about nostalgia. I’m about to take you on a whole journey musically.”</p>
      <p>Asanti, who collaborated with the crooner, posted a fabulous picture of herself on Instagram, where she stripped down to her undies while sitting on a bed.</p>
      <p>The singer also delighted her million followers with a shoot from a concert, where she can be seen standing on a stage and performing to an admiring crowd.</p>
      <p>Ashanti’s look for the event seemed dazzling as she wore a fresh and colorful bodysuit, and even though the outfit modestly kept from revealing too much skin, it outlined the singer’s curvy figure perfectly.</p>

      <p>The 39-year-old combined the colorful attire with huge sunglasses and simple, but oversized hoop earrings.</p>
      <p>The stunning effect of the diva’s looks was completed by impeccable makeup and bright red lipstick.</p>
      <p>Ashanti wore her hair in a playful voluminous ponytail that was set very high.</p>

      <p>The bombshell captioned the picture by simply stating that it was a blessing for her to perform, and indeed she looked like she was having the time of her life.</p>
      <p>In the photo, Ashanti’s skin was glowing, and she raised her hands up in the air, and it seems like she really enjoyed the moment.</p>

      <p>Very soon, the image gathered a remarkable number of likes, and a lot of supporters commented on how fine Ashanti looked.</p>

      <p>It seems like Ashanti may be really into the trend of combining form-fitting clothes with big sunglasses since she wore the look a couple of days earlier in LA too.</p>
      <p>Ashanti is getting better with time.</p>
