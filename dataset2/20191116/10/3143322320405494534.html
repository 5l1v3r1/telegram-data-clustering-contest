      <p>WHITE RIVER – Clint Cunningham, the lead singer, was first invited to play at the venue 18 years ago and only went from strength to strength from there.</p>
      <p>Cunningham stated that the Barnyard White River is their favourite place to play and carries a special place in the hearts of the band.</p>
      <blockquote>“We had epic rock and roll shows which led to interesting adventures here. We have performed here three times before, as the last show under the pretence that the place is closing down, but it keeps on existing and they keep on inviting us back,” Cunningham claimed.</blockquote>
      <p>The White River crowd in turn loves them, as they keep being invited back due to popular demand.</p>
      <p>The band pays a wonderful tribute to CCR with three musos who are wonderful at their craft. They manage to incorporate their strengths as a band into their music.</p>

      <p>Peter “the Hammer” Hanmer on guitar, Larry “the Legend”, with his thumping drums and dangerous Dawid “the Glass Blaster” Visser on bass, entertained the crowd with Creedence classics such as “Rollin’ on a River”, “Who’ll Stop the Rain”, “Down on a Corner” and “Have You Ever Seen the Rain”. “I am Clinton, and I facilitate healing through music”, Cunningham said, while mesmerizing the crowd with some of his own songs, like “Engelsman” and the “Little Pub Singer”.</p>
      <blockquote>Most of the people described the show as excellent and thoroughly entertaining. Archie Bremner said that he had seen the show when it started 18 years ago and it had matured like a good wine. “It is too difficult to choose between the songs, because all Clint’s songs are good,” he said</blockquote>
      <p>Steven Hyson, the owner of the Barnyard in White River, was impressed by the crowd turnout. He told Lowvelder that CCR’s performance is consistently good. “The people love Clint because of his hilarious interaction with them.”</p>
