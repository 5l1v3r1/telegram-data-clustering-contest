      <p>Sporadic protests erupted in cities across Iran, state news agency IRNA said on Saturday, a day after the government announced a surprise decision to ration petrol and hike its price.</p>
      <p>The demonstrations on Friday night were "severe" in Sirjan in central Iran as "people attacked a fuel storage warehouse in the city and tried to set fire to it," the news agency reported.</p>
      <p>But police intervened to prevent them.</p>
      <p>IRNA said "scattered" protests also broke out in other cities including Mashhad, Birjand, Ahvaz, Gachsaran, Abadan, Khoramshahr, Mahshahr, Shiraz and Bandar Abbas.</p>
      <p>They were mostly limited to blocking traffic and were over by midnight, it added.</p>
      <p>Iran imposed petrol rationing and raised pump prices by at least 50 per cent on Friday, saying the move was aimed at helping citizens in need with cash handouts.</p>
      <p>The measure was expected to bring in 300 trillion rials ($2.55 billion) per annum, the head of the country's Planning and Budget Organisation, Mohammad Bagher Nobakht, said on state television.</p>
      <p>About 60 million Iranians in need would get payments ranging from 550,000 rials ($4.68) for couples to slightly more than two million rials ($17.46) for families with five members or more, he added.</p>
