        <b>The registration of pet dogs, cats and ferrets on a new database seems to be causing some confusion.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The team running the new SIAC Pet Information Database, the National Vets Union, said it receives an average of 1,000 emails a day regarding problems with registrations.</p>
      <p>The union said teething issues will be ironed out by the end of the year.</p>
      <p>One of the main issues appears to be the duplication of information on the new platform with existing databases.</p>
