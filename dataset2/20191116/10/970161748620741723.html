      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/avengers/">Avengers</a>’ Chris Hemsworth has been celebrating his mum Leonie’s birthday with a sweet throwback snap and he looks like an absolute angel.</p>
      <p>The god of thunder who?</p>
      <p>Sharing an old-school photo of Mama Hemsworth during a camping trip, the Thor actor showed his younger self smiling away into the distance.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, he already looked to be a bit of a poser, with one foot in front of the other and his arms balancing him.</p>
      <p>What an absolute angel. How things change, right Chris?</p>

      <p>‘Happy birthday mum. True champion of champions. Love ya xo,’ the 36-year-old wrote.</p>
      <p>And Chris has been all about the family love recently – even being spotted <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/04/chris-hemsworth-cuddling-his-dog-on-the-beach-is-making-our-hearts-melt-11038204/">giving his dog a cuddle on the beach as he enjoyed a day out</a> with his wife Elsa Pataky.</p>

      <p>However, the star’s making sure to support the rest of his family too, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/02/liam-hemsworth-buys-home-next-to-brother-chris-proving-sibling-bond-is-unbreakable-11032059/">buying the house next to his brother Liam after his split from Miley Cyrus.</a></p>
      <p>Ah brotherly love.</p>
      <p>The Hunger Games star’s new 35-hectare property is located in Broken Head, near Byron Bay, Australia, with the country’s Daily Telegraph newspaper reporting that the crib was bought by his family company CHLH Management last week for $4.25 million (£2.27 million).</p>

      <p>Following Liam and Miley’s shock split, it was reported that Chris was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/14/chris-hemsworth-legend-lending-shoulder-liam-wake-miley-cyrus-split-10567361/">lending a shoulder to his younger brother, with them both back in their Aussie homeland.</a></p>
      <p>Laying low and heading out for a spot of frozen yoghurt followed by a surf, Liam extended his stay in the motherland Australia in the wake of the split with Chris being pretty helpful with the blues.</p>
      <p>‘Liam is really sad about the breakup,’ a source<a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/liam-hemsworth-leaning-on-brother-chris-after-miley-cyrus-split/"> claimed to Us Weekly.</a></p>
      <p>‘His family has been taking care of him, and he’s been leaning on Chris throughout his trip to Australia.’</p>
      <p>Can we get a Hemsworth brother of our own please?</p>
