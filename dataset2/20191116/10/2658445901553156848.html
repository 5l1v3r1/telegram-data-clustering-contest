      <p>Former President Goodluck Jonathan has said he was not happy at what he observed at his hometown polling unit, Otuokein Ogbia Local Government Area of Bayelsa.</p>
      <p>He said this on Saturday while addressing newsmen after casting his vote at 11:30am.</p>
      <p>“I arrived the polling unit around 8:19am and there was no conduct of election, no journalist to observe the election,’’</p>
      <p>“I am really disappointed on what I observed today compare to other African countries I monitored elections.’’</p>

      <p>He further said that throughout his participation in monitoring elections in many African countries that he had never seen where election officials arrived at polling units so late.</p>
      <p>“I have led election monitoring teams to other African countries, we use to go 30 minutes before the time and in our reports, we indicate the exact time when the vote starts.</p>
      <p>“So, for election to start after that time it is an indictment to the electoral body that manages election, there is no reason here election should not start by 8:00 a.m.</p>
      <p>“So, even the youth should stop blaming old people, you blame yourselves and do things properly.</p>
