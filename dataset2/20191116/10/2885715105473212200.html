      <h1>Mohammed Shami becomes the most successful second innings bowler in last two years</h1>
      <h2>Mohammed Shami is the only bowler in the world in the last two years to take three five-wicket hauls in the second innings.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T10:15:49+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 10:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/sports-desk/" target="_blank">Sports Desk</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/mohammed-shami/">Mohammed Shami</a> has proved himself as an excellent bowler in the second innings. Bowling in short bursts, Shami has become the most successful bowler in the last two years when bowling in the second innings. The 29-year-old has taken 51 wickets from 20 innings at an impressive average of 17.00. His strike rate of 32.2 is best among bowlers who have taken 25 or more wickets in the previous two years in the second innings of a Test.</p>
      <p>Only two bowlers who come near Shami are Australia’s Pat Cummins and Nathan Lyon with 48 and 47 wickets respectively. They are followed by South Africa’s Kagiso Rabada (34 wickets), <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/ravindra-jadeja/">Ravindra Jadeja</a> (32), Jasprit Bumrah (29), Josh Hazlewood (29) and so on.</p>
      <p>His bowling average is also the fourth-highest (20 or more wickets).</p>
      <p>Usually, spin bowlers take more wickets than fast bowlers in the latter stages of the match as they bowl into the rough and extract turn from the pitch. However, in the past two years, there have been only two spinners in the top 10 list of highest wicket-taker in second innings.</p>

      <p>Shami also registered his third-best Test bowling figures against Bangladesh in the Indore Test, with a brilliant 4/31 in the second innings. His best remains the 5/35 he took against South Africa in the Vishakapatnam Test earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Shami was impressive in India’s 3-0 win over South Africa at home as well. He has taken three five-wicket hauls in the second innings in the last two years and also became the first fast bowler in 23 years to take a fifer in fourth innings in India. His demolishing spell was lauded by <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/mohammed-shami-a-second-innings-wrecking-ball-6056676/">India’s bowling coach Bharat Arun</a>.</p>
      <p>“It’s a natural skill, of course, that depends on the release action, but Shami does two things with it. The seam presentation, just look at how steady it gets across the track. Then, he focusses on getting a bat-width movement, just enough to beat the bat and either hit the pad or stumps. Now and then, in helpful conditions, he will, of course, get the ball to cut a lot more, but essentially, he is focused on moving it just a little. The big seam deviations look good on TV, but don’t fetch you wickets,” Bharat had told <a href="https://indianexpress.com/">the Indian Express</a>.</p>
