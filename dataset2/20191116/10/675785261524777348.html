      <h1>Katie Price rescued by son Junior after being savaged by vile online troll</h1>
      <h2>The mum-of-five was defended by her son after coming under attack after former husband Peter Andre shared a video on Instagram</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T10:35:59+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 10:35</time> by <a rel="author">Mirror .co.uk</a></address>
      <p>Katie Price was passionately defended by one of her sons after she was savagely trolled on an <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> post.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/katie-price">The 41-year-old former glamour model</a> tends to spark something of a marmite reaction among the general public - with many feeling they can never get enough of her, while others can’t bear the sight.</p>
      <p>On Friday, the reality star found herself under attack from those less inclined to her when ex-husband <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/peter-andre">Peter Andre</a> shared an innocent video of himself playing with children Junior, 14, and Princess, 12.</p>
      <p>While 46-year-old Peter played catch with an egg with daughter Princess, Junior could be see dancing around in the background.</p>

      <p>The candid family moment was a hit with fans - but one mean spirited follower seized the moment to rub proverbial dirt on Katie’s good name.</p>
      <p>“Junior is always bopping around, so funny! Nice to see what real families do and not what Katie does which is use her kids to make the headlines! Sorry but had to be said,” the follower wrote - <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10351699/katie-price-junior-defend-trolls/">according to The Sun.</a></p>
      <p>While comments appear to have since been deleted, the news site claims Junior hit back at the remark to defend his mother.</p>

      <p>They claim the teen wrote: “u don't need to post negative stuff bout my mum.”</p>
      <p>While it is unclear if the online spat continued before comments were terminated, there is no mistaking the fact that Katie and Pete have clashed in the past over the treatment of their two children.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Katie banned her former husband from featuring pictures and videos of Princess and Junior on his social media channels after he did the same to her.</p>

      <p>However, the stunt reportedly backfired, as it was claimed at the time: “Pete agreed, which Kate didn't see coming.”</p>
      <p>Katie is said to be facing a quiet Christmas next month her children are due to spend the festive season with their respective fathers.</p>
      <p>It is said Princess and Junior with join Peter and his wife Emily MacDonagh with their two children Theodore, two, and Amelia, five.</p>
      <p>While Keiran Hayler (Katie’s third husband) will be looking after six-year-old son Jett and five-year-old daughter Bunny.</p>
      <p>Katie and on-off boyfriend Kris Boyson, 31, are said to be planning a holiday alongside Katie’s eldest son, Harvey, 17, from a past fling with footballer Dwight Yorke, 48.</p>
