      <p>Aston Villa are continuing a ‘comprehensive’ investigation into the racist Marvelous Nakamba chant that was heard earlier this season.</p>
      <p>Footage shared widely on social media showed a <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/we-dont-want-you-fans-17039645">group of fans singing a song about the Zimbabwe midfielder which contained racial slurs.</a></p>
      <p>The incident happened in October, when <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> thrashed Norwich City 5-1 at Carrow Road.</p>
      <p>Villa released a strong statement at the time saying they were ‘disgusted and appalled’ by the chant and promised that those found to be responsible will be dealt with ‘in the strongest manner’ and reported to the Police.</p>
