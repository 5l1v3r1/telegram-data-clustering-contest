      <p>Five supporters of former Bolivian President Evo Morales were killed in clashes between protesters and security forces in central Bolivia on Friday.</p>
      <p>The violence, which also left at least 75 injured, escalates unrest facing a four-day-old interim government whose opponents accuse it of carrying out a foreign-backed, right-wing coup to topple the country’s first indigenous leader.</p>
      <p>Thousands of mostly indigenous protesters had gathered peacefully in Sacaba, but clashes broke out when they attempted to cross a military checkpoint near the city of Cochabamba, the country’s fourth-largest city.</p>
      <p>Witnesses reported the police and military fired live ammunition at protesters, who had earlier been shot at with tear gas.</p>
      <p>Morales, who resigned on Sunday and fled to Mexico after coming under pressure from opposition protesters and the military following a disputed October 20 election, wrote on Twitter that the interim government was massacring people and represented a “true dictatorship.”</p>
      <p>The Inter-American Commission for Human Rights condemned what it called a disproportionate use by security forces of live fire and tear gas against protesters.</p>
      <p>The interim government didn’t immediately comment on the deaths but said around 100 people had been arrested.</p>
      <p>Angry supporters of Morales have staged their own protests since his ouster against the interim government.</p>
      <p>Interim President Jeanine Anez, the vice president of the senate who took over on Tuesday after a spate of resignations, said Friday that Morales could return to Bolivia but would face justice over allegations of electoral fraud and corruption.</p>
      <p>However, she has said Morales cannot be a candidate in new elections.</p>
      <p>Morales claims he is still president because Congress did not officially accept his resignation.</p>
      <p>The Constitutional Court has backed Anez’s claim that she didn’t need to be confirmed by Congress, a body controlled by Morales’ Movement Toward Socialism party.</p>
      <p>The interim government is seeking to strike a deal with the Movement for Socialism to hold new elections to end the crisis.</p>
      <p>Morales’ nearly 14 years in power were marked by an economic boom that addressed entrenched inequality and provided greater rights to indigenous communities in a country traditionally dominated by white-skinned descendants of Europeans.</p>
      <p>However, many people became disenchanted with his bid to hold onto power for a fourth term.</p>
