      <p>KIRKSVILLE, Mo. â€” Deer firearm season officially kicked off on November 16, 2019, for the state of Missouri.</p>
      <p>However, if you are hunting in one of the 29 counties in the CWD Management Zone you will have to have your harvested deer tested for chronic wasting disease (CWD) at one of the sampling stations.</p>
      <p>Of the 29 counties, seven of those counties reside in northeast Missouri.</p>
      <p>Those counties are Adair, Knox, Linn, Macon, Mercer, Putnam, and Sullivan counties.</p>
      <p>The goal of these sampling stations is to ensure that the deer the hunters harvested are safe to consume and help the Missouri Department of Conservation monitor the landscape of CWD.</p>
      <p>CWD sampling and their test results are free.</p>
      <p>Sampling stations will be opened from 7:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. this weekend.</p>
      <p>You can find the closest sampling station near you by heading to this <a href="https://huntfish.mdc.mo.gov/hunting-trapping/wildlife-diseases/chronic-wasting-disease-cwd/mandatory-cwd-sampling-2019">website</a>.</p>
