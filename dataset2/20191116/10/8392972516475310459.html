      <p>The Duchess of Cambridge will be the guest of honour on Mary Berry's Christmas TV special, a newspaper report has claimed.</p>
      <p>The festive BBC One show is expected to show Kate Middleton and the former <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/great-british-bake-off/">Great British Bake Off</a> star teaming up to cook up a feast to treat a group of charity workers who give up their Christmas and New Year to look after others.</p>
      <p>Other famous faces are also expected to lend Mary a hand - and the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/">Mirror</a> speculates the big bash may even occur at a royal venue.</p>
      <p>It is believed filming is underway for The Mary Berry Royal Christmas Show and will continue for some weeks.</p>

      <p>A unnamed source is reported to have said: "What better way to spread some Christmas cheer than to team up cookery royalty Mary Berry with real royalty in the form of Kate?</p>
      <p>"Between them they will bring seasonal goodwill to their guests and to the millions of viewers watching. Expect a properly uplifting Christmas treat."</p>
      <aside>All will be revealed in due course.</aside>
      <p>A BBC spokesman declined to comment to the Mirror beyond telling the tabloid: "All will be revealed in due course."</p>
      <p>Kate, 37, and Mary, 84, are thought to have become friends after first meeting at an event supporting charity Child Bereavement UK in 2013.</p>

      <p>The pair were seen chuckling and chatting together at RHS Wisley in September.</p>
      <p>Kate said at the time: "It's really important the kids start to understand nature, and care for it, so they can protect it as well."</p>
