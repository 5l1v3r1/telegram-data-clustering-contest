      <h3>Remember, technology is a distraction</h3>
      <p>Apparently, technology, which is supposed to bring people together, has been labelled as the main cause of distraction. While you are busy watching movies and soap operas, your child is learning different things. While it is important that you kid learns on his own, it is also a fact that they he will learn better if you are there to help him. For example, kids develop better language skills by communicating back and forth with their parents.</p>
      <h3>Avoid negative role modeling</h3>
      <p>By being too involved in your phone at home or while driving, you are setting a bad example for your children. This is called negative role modeling. Negative role modeling inserts an ideology in a child’s brain, which is exactly how he behaves when he grows up. Another thing that distracted parenting causes is a feeling of acting out in children. While the parents are busy in their own world, children often feel neglected and unwanted.</p>
      <h3>Complete conversations</h3>
      <p>Phone interrupting conversation between parents and children is a sign for children that parents has more important things to deal with than him. This causes acting out, limited sharing of information, sulking, whining and throwing fits.</p>
