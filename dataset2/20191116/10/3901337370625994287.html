      <p>"I complained because he [Messi] should have been shown a yellow card and he told me to shut my mouth and I told him to shut his mouth," Tite was quoted as saying by Mirror.</p>
      <p>"I don't want to answer anymore on it. You need a strong referee because he'll swallow you… It should have been a card, I was right to complain."</p>
