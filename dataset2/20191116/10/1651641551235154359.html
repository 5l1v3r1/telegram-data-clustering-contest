      <h1>Microsoft blocks Windows 10 1909 Update on PCs with old Realtek Bluetooth Radio drivers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T10:33:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 10:33</time> by <a rel="author">Rahul</a></address>
      <p>Microsoft rolled out the latest Windows 10 update dubbed <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/windows-10-november-2019-update-now-available-for-download/">Windows 10 November 2019 Update to the public a few days ago</a>. Windows 10 November 2019 or Windows 10 1909 is the second and last major update of 2019.</p>
      <p>While the update is available to almost every Windows 10 PC that meets the eligibility, Windows 10 PCs with old Realtek Bluetooth Radio drivers won’t be able to install the update as Microsoft applied “a compatibility hold” on devices with Realtek Bluetooth Radio drivers older than Version 1.5.1012.</p>
      <p>If you’re one of those who are trying to upgrade to the latest version of Windows 10 without updating the older Realtek Bluetooth Radio drivers to Version 1.5.1012, you’ll likely to receive a message that <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4529832/updating-to-windows-10-version-1903-on-devices-with-some-driver-versio">says</a>, “Realtek Bluetooth: Your PC has a driver or service that isn’t ready for this version of windows 10. A new version is available.”</p>

      <p>Worse, users who are trying to upgrade to the Windows 10 May 2019 Update(1903) or Windows 10 October 2018 Update(1809) will also receive the exact same message if the PC packs old Realtek Bluetooth Radio drivers.</p>
      <blockquote>To safeguard your update experience, we have applied a compatibility hold on devices with affected driver versions for Realtek Bluetooth radios from installing Windows 10, version 1909 or Windows 10, version 1903 until the driver has been updated.</blockquote>
      <p>For a smooth update experience, Microsoft recommends users to update their Realtek Bluetooth Radio drivers to at least Version 1.5.1012.  And that’s the only option available for now, unfortunately.</p>
      <p>After updating the Realtek Bluetooth Radio Drivers, make sure to check for updates once again and this time around, you should be able to reach the destination without facing any issue.</p>
