      <h1>Transfer News: Bayern Munich rekindle interest in Leroy Sane</h1>

      <h3>Bayern Munich are reportedly keen to pounce on long-term target Leroy Sane next summer, with Manchester City already preparing to land his replacement.</h3>
      <p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/15/manchester-city-face-battle-keep-leroy-sane-bayern-munich-retaining/">Daily Telegraph</a>, Bayern Munich have reignited their interest in Leroy Sane and his Manchester City teammates are convinced that the Germany international is heading to Bavaria next summer.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old winger suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury in his right knee which splashed water on <a href="http://www.thehardtackle.com/news/2019/05/21/transfer-news-bayern-munich-closing-in-on-leroy-sane-capture">Bayern Munich’s dream of landing the former Schalke star in the summer</a>. Although, there were questions over Bayern Munich’s ability to meet Manchester City’s lofty £137 million valuation of the player.</p>
      <p>However, the Bavarians have not given up their hopes to land the youngster and with Sane entering the last year of his contract with the Premier League champions, Bayern are hopeful that they will finally secure his signature next summer for a smaller asking fee.</p>
      <p>The report suggests that Manchester City have also laid down the plans to replace the 23-year-old and the most heavily linked name is Real Sociedad winger Mikel Oyarzabal. The Citizens were frustrated in their efforts to tie Sane down to a long-term deal, but the 2018 PFA Young Player of the Year seems to have made up his mind.</p>

      <p>Sane is an exceptional talent and there is a feeling among his Manchester City teammates that the 23-year-old is awestruck with the prospect of joining Bayern Munich, with the transfer also offering him the chance to go back home. Overall, they feel that this will be Sane’s last season at the Etihad.</p>
      <p>The former Schalke man has been rehabilitating in America after rupturing his ACL ahead of the season. A return in March was considered a possibility, but now, it looks as if Sane may return to action in February.</p>
      <p>The Germany international has always been a vital cog in Pep Guardiola’s side, but his inability to break into the first-team regularly last season frustrated him, as he was below Raheem Sterling in the pecking order. However, his absence this season has been felt and an exit would be a big blow to City. Sane has delivered when given a chance and has scored 39 times in 134 appearances after making his big-money move from Schalke back in 2016.</p>
      <p>It now remains to be seen if Bayern Munich indeed launch the offensive for Sane when the transfer window opens next summer. If so, it will be interesting to see if Manchester United can do anything to keep hold of the German international.</p>
