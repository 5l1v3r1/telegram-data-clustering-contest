      <h2>Aston Villa transfer news | The New Year is not far away and that means the re-opening of the transfer window with Dean Smith's side looking to reinforce their squad</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T10:07:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 10:07</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Cusack</a></address>
      <p>January could be crucial to Aston Villa's hopes of staying in the Premier League.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/dean-smith">Dean Smith</a>'s side freshened up the squad in the summer with the arrival of 12 new players to replace the same amount who departed at a tune of a cool £130 million.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> sit in 17th place after 12 League matches in their first campaign back in the top flight after three years in the Championship and staying in the League will be absolutely key.</p>
      <p>Just as important as on-field matters could be what Villa do in the January transfer window when it re-opens in the New Year.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Do Villa need a new striker? <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-transfer-news-january-17267363">Fans are split on Wesley Moraes</a> and backup could be just the ticket for the Villa Park side.</p>
      <p>
        <i>We'll update this story regularly to include the potential targets linked with Villa and the current players who could leave...</i>
      </p>
      <h4>Alfredo Morelos</h4>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/alfredo-morelos">Morelos</a> has been heavily linked with a move to Villa, his impressive performances north of the border highlighting a goal threat that Villa currently lack up front.</p>
      <p>Rangers are desperate to keep hold of him, though, with boss Steven Gerrard and recruitment chief Ross Wilson issuing a firm 'not for sale' warning.</p>
      <h4>Sam McCallum</h4>
      <p>The young full-back has impressed for Coventry City this season and has admitted to being 'flattered' by speculation linking him with a move out of League One.</p>
      <p>Villa, Leeds United and West Bromwich Albion are all rumoured to be interested in the 19-year-old.</p>

      <h4>Ben Chrisen</h4>
      <p>Chrisen is one for the future.</p>
      <p>The 15-year-old midfielder, currently with Exeter City, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/aston-villa-transfer-news-club-17194865">is also said to be wanted by Chelsea</a> , Liverpool and Bayern Munich.</p>
      <h4>Olivier Giroud</h4>
      <p>Not a player linked with Villa necessarily, but the claret and blue faithful want to bring the Chelsea striker to Villa Park <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/aston-villa-transfer-news-giroud-17254658">after hearing he will be available for a cut-price fee of £6m</a> .</p>
      <p>He would certainly be a good back-up to Wesley and bolster the forward department.</p>
      <h3>RUMOURED DEPARTURES</h3>
      <p>
        <b>John McGinn</b>
      </p>
      <p>McGinn's excellent early-season form saw calls for Manchester United and Liverpool to sign the Scotland international.</p>
      <p>He has taken to the Premier League well, scoring three goals in 12 games including Villa's first back in the Premier League in the 3-1 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>Jack Grealish</b>
      </p>
      <p>All the talk about Grealish now is whether he will be able to shake off a calf injury in time for the Newcastle United match on November 25.</p>
      <p>He was in fine form until he suffered the injury against Manchester City in October.</p>
      <h4>WHEN DOES THE TRANSFER WINDOW OPEN?</h4>
      <p>The window opens again on Wednesday, January 1 2020.</p>
      <h4>WHAT IS VILLA'S RECORD TRANSFER FEE PAID?</h4>
      <p>This is a bone of contention because of the way transfers are structured with add-ons and the like. In terms of an up-front payment, Wesley's move from Club Brugge is the current record fee paid by Villa at £22m.</p>
      <h4>WHAT IS VILLA'S RECORD TRANSFER FEE RECEIVED?</h4>
      <p>The reported £32.5m that Liverpool paid for Christian Benteke is by far and away the most the claret and blues have received for a player.</p>
