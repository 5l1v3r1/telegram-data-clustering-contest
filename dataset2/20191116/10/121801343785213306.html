      <p>Cinematographer Lawrence Sher's dramatic lensing of <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/topic/joker"><i>Joker</i></a>, Todd Phillips' psychological thriller about the origin of the DC Comics villain, claimed the Golden Frog in the main competition at the <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/behind-screen/camerimage-cinematography-festival-announces-main-competition-lineup-1248952">EnergaCamerimage festival</a> on Saturday in Torun, Poland. The pic additionally won the Audience Award.</p>
      <p>Among the other prizes presented during the cinematography festival's closing ceremony, Camerimage awarded the Silver Frog to Fernando Meirelles' Netflix release <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/two-popes-review-1235993"><i>The Two Popes</i></a>, lensed by Uruguayan DP Cesar Charlone. With Meirelles, Charlone previously earned the 2003 Golden Frog (and an Academy Award nomination) for<i> City of God</i> and the 2008 Silver Frog for <i>Blindness</i>.</p>
      <p>The Bronze Frog and the FIPRESCI International Critics Prize went to <i><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/painted-bird-review-1236151">The Painted Bird</a>, </i>Czech Republic's Oscar entry for best international feature film. Written and directed by Vaclav Marhoul, the adaptation of Jerzy Kosinski's Holocaust novel of the same name was photographed in black and white by lenser Vladimir Smutny.</p>
      <p>These are closely watched awards, as the cinematography festival's main competition has become a bellwether for what's to come in the Oscar category. In three of the past six years, the winners of Camerimage's Golden Frog have gone on to earn Oscar nominations in cinematography. Those films include 2013's<i> Ida</i>, 2015's <i>Carol</i> and 2016's <i>Lion</i>. (The 2014 Golden Frog winner,<i> Leviathan</i>, and the 2017 Camerimage champ, <i>On Body and Soul</i>, were each nominated in the foreign-language film Oscar category.)</p>
      <p>Last year, <i>The Fortress, </i>a 2017 film that was not eligible for last year's Oscar race, won the Golden Frog. However, the Silver Frog went to <i>Cold War</i>, which earned a cinematography Oscar nomination and won the American Society of Cinematographers feature competition. The Bronze Frog went to <i>Roma</i>, which won the Oscar in cinematography.</p>
      <p>This year's main competition lineup also included Martin Scorsese's crime film <i>The Irishman</i>, the racing drama <i>Ford v. Ferrari</i>, Edward Norton's noir thriller <i>Motherless Brooklyn </i>and the indie drama <i>The Last Black Man in San Francisco, </i>as well as <i>Amundsen, </i><i>Bolden, </i><i>Never Look Away, </i><i>Mr. Jones</i>, <i>An Officer and a Spy </i>and <i>Shadow.</i></p>
      <p>The main competition jury was led by director Michael Hoffman (<i>The Last Station</i>), and included cinematographers John de Borman (<i>The Full Monty</i>), Peter James (<i>Driving Miss Daisy</i>), Teresa Medina (<i>Things I Never Told You</i>), Anastas Michos (<i>The Kissing Booth</i>) and Dante Spinotti (<i>L.A. Confidential</i>), as well as screenwriter Jordan Roberts (<i>Big Hero 6</i>).</p>
      <p>Of photographing Warner Bros.' <i>Joker</i>, Sher said in a <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/behind-screen/joker-dp-lawrence-sher-influences-controversy-antihero-movie-1244755?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=THR%20Behind%20the%20Screen_2019-10-03%2006:00:00_ARahman&amp;utm_term=hollywoodreporter_therace_bts">recent episode</a> of <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i>'s<i> Behind the Screen</i> podcast<i>, </i>"Knowing that the movie was first and foremost a character study — and one of the reasons that I was really keen on shooting with this larger format — was the way it allows you to shoot closer, really intimate proximity to the actors, which I think psychologically is subconscious but it really matters to an audience. ... When you have somebody performing at the level that [Joaquin Phoenix] is performing, you want to be close. You want to see the nuances."</p>
      <p>Quentin Tarantino and Robert Richardson received the Camerimage cinematographer-director duo award, as their <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/topic/once-a-time-hollywood"><i>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</i></a> closed the festival.</p>
      <p>Also during the ceremony, cinematographer and past Motion Picture Academy president John Bailey received the fest's Lifetime Achievement Award. Additional honorees included Edward Norton, who received the Krzysztof Kieslowski Award; Lech Majewski, special directing award; Jan Roelfs, award to a production designer; and Richard Gere, special award to an actor. Camerimage also presented a special honor to the British Society of Cinematographers on its 70th anniversary.</p>
      <p>During the festival's Nov. 9 opening ceremony, Camerimage recognized the ASC for its 100th anniversary. as well as Peter Greenaway with a lifetime achievement award for directing; Danny De Vito, lifetime achievement award for acting; Ewa Dalkowska, award for a Polish actress; and Helena Trestikova, outstanding achievement in documentary filmmaking.</p>
      <p>This year, the Polish festival, now in its 27th installment, returned to the city of Torun, which hosted the first seven editions of Camerimage. Representing an expected investment of roughly $1.55 million, the city, state, and Camerimage are planning to construct a new institution — a European Film Center Camerimage — which would host future festivals and other events in Torun.</p>
