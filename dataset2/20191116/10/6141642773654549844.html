      <p>England sealed their qualification for next summer’s tournament against Montenegro on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>However, England’s 1,000th international was overshadowed by the boos that greeted Gomez when he came on as a second-half substitute.</p>
      <p>Gomez was left with a scratch on his face following a confrontation with Raheem Sterling this week at St George’s Park. The Manchester City star was subsequently dropped from the squad to face Montenegro.</p>
