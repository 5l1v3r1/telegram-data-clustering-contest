      <p>Netherlands boss Ronald Koeman believes Memphis Depay was ‘too young’ to succeed at <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> during his ill-fated 18 months at the club.</p>
      <p>The Dutch winger joined the Red Devils in 2015 as a £25million signing from PSV Eindhoven after being convinced of the move by former national boss Louis van Gaal.</p>
      <p>Depay was handed the no7 shirt but early signs of promise soon faded as the youngster developed a reputation for being difficult to handle.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, Depay managed 7 goals in 45 appearances in his debut campaign and hoped to kick on under <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a>, who replaced van Gaal after two years at the club.</p>

      <p>But Mourinho found little use for Depay, playing him in just four league matches before he was allowed to join Lyon.</p>
      <p>United have a buy-back clause in Depay’s deal and also have first option on the winger, should Lyon decide to sell.</p>

      <p>That Depay failed to make the grade at Old Trafford still irks some at the club but Koeman, the Dutchman’s national boss, says he simply wasn’t ready for the move.</p>

      <p>‘I think he’s a top player and maybe during his time at Manchester United he was a little bit too young,’ said Koeman.</p>
      <p>‘He’s now more experienced and what he’s showed and what he has done for the national team is great and I’m really glad that we have that kind of player in our national team.’</p>
