      <h1>KogiDecides: Party agents involved in vote buying</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T10:03:52+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 10:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/north-central/363435-kogidecides-party-agents-involved-in-vote-buying.html" target="_blank">Nike Adebowale</a></address>
      <p>Some agents of the All Progressive Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) are allegedly paying people to vote for their parties.</p>
      <p>At Ward 09, Unit 010 LGEA Primary School, Obehira Eba in Okene Local Government Area (LGA) of Kogi State, a party agent, said to be of the APC, voted on on behalf of accredited voters.</p>
      <p>Our reporter witnessed the agent retrieve the ballot papers from already accredited voters and do the thumbprinting himself.</p>
      <p>The agent then directed the voters to another man to collect N2,000 after casting their votes.</p>
      <p>The INEC and security officials present did nothing to stop the act.</p>
      <p>There was also evidence of vote buying In PU002, Ward 009, LGEA School Ikaraworo/Idobanyere, Adavi LGA.</p>
      <p>The act was allegedly being carried out by agents of APC.</p>
      <p>At PU 003, Ward 1, Oguma, Bassa LGA, agents said to be of the PDP were seen sharing N500 to voters who already cast their vote.</p>
      <p>Voter inducement is against the Electoral Act 2010. Section 124(4) of the Act states that:</p>
      <p>“Any person who commits the offence of bribery is liable on conviction to a maximum fine of N500,000 or imprisonment for 12 months or both.”</p>
      <p>Thousands of Kogi residents are out to cast their votes for the candidates of their choice in a keenly contested governorship election.</p>
      <p>A total of 24 parties are taking part in the election. Although the registered voters in the state are 1,646,350, about 1,485,828 (90.2%) have collected their PVCs and are thus eligible to vote in the 21 local governments of the state.</p>
