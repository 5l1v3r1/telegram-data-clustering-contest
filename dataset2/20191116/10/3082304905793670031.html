        <b>Premier League giants Manchester United are open to loaning Erling Haaland back to RB Salzburg till the end of the season, provided they can sign him on a permanent deal from the Austrian side during the upcoming January transfer window.</b>
      </p>
      <p>This is according to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/man-utd-consider-erling-haaland-20891335"><i>Mirror</i></a>, who claims that Manchester United are ready to beat Real Madrid to the signing of the 19-year-old Norwegian wonderkid, and by proposing to send him back to Salzburg on loan until the end of the season, they are hopeful of attracting their attention during January.</p>
      <p>The young striker has scored 26 goals in just 18 matches in 2019-20 – 15 from 12 Austrian Bundesliga appearances, seven from four Champions League appearances and four from two OFB Cup appearances.</p>
      <p>He has also scored five hat-tricks so far this season – three in the Austrian Bundesliga, one in the UCL and one in the OFB Cup.</p>
      <p>The former Molde forward is aware of Manchester United’s and Real Madrid’s keenness to sign him, but when quizzed about his future by Norwegian news agency <i>Dagbladet </i>in a recent interview, he chose to remain secretive.</p>
      <p>Upon asked “Juventus, Manchester United and Real Madrid: what do you think about playing at any of them?” he replied: “You know my answer. No comment.”</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen whether United’s latest plan to beat <i>Los Blancos</i> to Haaland’s signing, will work in their favour – as both teams are yet to submit official bids to RB Salzburg.</p>
