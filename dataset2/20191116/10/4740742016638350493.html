      <h1>Woman who tried to save choking Wetherspoons pub diner claims staff were ill-prepared</h1>
      <h2>"It was a sheer panic kind of cry"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T10:46:21+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 10:46</time> by <a rel="author">Tomas Malloy, Geoffrey Bennett</a></address>
      <p>A woman who tried to save a man's life in a pub has claimed staff didn't know what to do.</p>
      <p>But JD Wetherspoon, which runs The Palladium Electric in <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/midsomer-norton">Midsomer Norton</a>, has said staff did all they could to assist.</p>
      <p>Kelly Cole was enjoying a family meal hours before the town carnival when she heard a man crying for help.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.somersetlive.co.uk/news/somerset-news/midsomer-norton-spoons-wetherspoon-death-3542744">She told Somerset Live</a>: "At first I thought it might have been a joke or a kid running around or something.</p>
      <p>"Then I realized this was serious, it was a sheer panic kind of cry.</p>
      <p>"I ran up to the man and started hitting him in the back from behind with my hand, and then he fell to the floor."</p>
      <p>Ms Cole, who is first-aid trained, was guided on the phone by an ambulance call handler until paramedics arrived.</p>
      <p>She says when the call handler asked if anyone knew CPR nobody knew what to do, so she stepped in.</p>
      <p>She said: "I had to shout at the staff to stop letting customers into the pub as they were still letting people and children in and I didn't want people to walk in on what was happening.</p>
      <p>"The staff were even still serving food at the time, there was a lady coming out with plates in her hands to serve to people.</p>

      <p>"I find it disturbing that none of the staff there are first-aid trained - the manager told me that at the time.</p>
      <p>"I personally think all staff should be first-aid trained at a place like that."</p>
      <p>Sadly <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/local-news/man-dies-after-choking-food-3540677">the man died after being taken to hospital</a>.</p>
      <p>JD Wetherspoon spokesman Eddie Gershon said: “First and foremost we send our sympathies to the family and friends of the customer who passed away.</p>
      <p>“As soon as a member of staff was made aware of the man choking, staff and customers called the emergency services.</p>
      <p>“The duty manager then spoke with the emergency services.</p>
      <p>"He was guided through some procedures.</p>
      <p>"A customer stepped in saying they were first-aid trained and started to give CPR until the paramedics arrived 5-10 minutes later and they then took over.</p>
      <p>“At this time the duty manager started to clear the immediate area of customers and also stopped people coming into the pub."</p>
      <h3>'The family thanked the team for their efforts'</h3>
      <p>“The paramedics managed to revive the customer and then an air ambulance took the customer to hospital.</p>
      <p>“The family of the customer called the pub the following day to say he had passed away and thanked the team for their efforts.</p>
      <p>“We are confident that staff responded well to the situation and refute claims to the contrary.”</p>
