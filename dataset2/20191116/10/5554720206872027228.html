      <p>Bangladesh were all out for 150 in their first innings. In response, India declared their innings at 393-6 with Agarwal <a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/sports/heartbreak-for-mayank-agarwal-as-he-departs-at-243-even-after-virat-kohlis-instruction-to-score-300/272631/">scoring 243</a>. Bangladesh’s batting collapsed once again in the second innings in the face of a devastatingly fast bowling attack by the Indians. The Tigers were bowled out for 213 in their second innings.</p>
      <p>Mohammed Shami took four wickets in the second innings, taking his number of wickets in the match to seven. R Ashwin took three while Umesh Yadav scalped two. The last wicket went to Ishant Sharma.</p>
      <p>Reacting to India’s splendid win, skipper Virat Kohli said, “It’s clinical performance all around..The team is playing really well. Hats off to the boys.</p>
      <p>“These guys are on top of the world…It’s a dream bowling combination for any bowlers when you have these playing so well…The motivation has been high. The intent is right.”</p>
      <p>Today’s victory was the sixth straight Test win by Indians including three consecutive victories by more than an innings. Ashwin later paid tributes to India’s lethal fast bowling attack saying that he did not remember a time when the entire first session was bowled by pacers.</p>
      <p><b>Virat Kohli:</b> “Don’t know what to say, another clinical performance. Very professional with the bat, playing five batters with one guy taking responsibility is what we want with overseas tours coming up. Hats off to the boys. These guys are on top of their game, when they bowl, it looks like any pitch is a good pitch, Jasprit isn’t here but this is a dream combination for any captain. Having strong bowlers the most important thing in any team. The numbers and records are there for everyone to see, that’ll remain in the books, we haven’t focused on it. We’re looking at keeping the standards up, motivating the next lot of players. In that process, we’re pushing up the standards of Indian cricket. We don’t care about numbers at all as a team. The mindset is simple, when you see a young guy coming in to bat, in Tests I know how much time it took me to get those big hundreds, so I know the importance of getting big runs. It’s important as a senior batter to let them know to keep going. I want them to not make the mistakes I made as a youngsters to make them world-class cricketers. The pink-ball Test is going to be exciting, will be a challenge for the batters. With the older ball, it doesn’t swing that much so the bowlers will have a challenge. We’re just happy to be among the first to play pink-ball cricket for India. The crowd has been brilliant, these guys give us the extra motivation to push extra when we’re tired.”</p>
      <p><b>Mominul Haque (Bangladesh skipper): </b>“Toss definitely impacted the outcome, it’s been difficult. We won and decided to bat, was a difficult decision. I have a lot of positives, especially Abu Jayed who picked four wickets. Mushfiqur was superb with the bat in both innings, Liton did well too. The top-order batsmen had a challenge against a very good bowling line-up, so we need to try and play out 15-20 overs. We have no experience of Day-Night Test cricket, we’ll just try and enjoy that game.”</p>
