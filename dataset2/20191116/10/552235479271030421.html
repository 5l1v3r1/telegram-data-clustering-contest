      <h2>Labrador Bob is recovering from an operation and needs a new owner to give him plenty of TLC</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T10:02:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 10:02</time> by <a rel="author">Debbie Hall, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/debbie-hall/</a></address>
      <p>Can you give a home to lovable Labrador Bob who is currently under the care of Dogs Trust’s West Calder Rehoming Centre?</p>
      <p>Sweet Bob is nine years old and he is a very friendly boy who is house trained, travels well in the car and he would love a garden of his own where he can potter and investigate. Bob is currently recovering from an operation on his leg and so is looking for owners who can provide lots of TLC and a loving and cosy home where he can recuperate.</p>
      <p>Despite his recent operation, Bob is an active boy and his new owners will also need to be active and have previous experience with dogs. Bob will be happy living with children aged around 12 years old. Bob can be uncomfortable around other dogs and so he will need to be the only dog at home and be walked in quieter areas away from too many other dogs. A lovable and older character, Bob will make a wonderful addition to the family.</p>
