      <h1>Six flood warnings still remain in place in Nottinghamshire</h1>
      <h2>Immediate action is required by people in these areas</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T10:08:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 10:08</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Bunn</a></address>
      <p>People in Nottinghamshire are being urged to take action as several flood warnings remain in place across the county.</p>
      <p>Several warnings from earlier in the week are no longer in place but six areas are still at risk, according to the Environment Agency.</p>
      <p>The warnings mean <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/live-updates-flood-alert-issued-3536116">flooding</a> is expected and immediate action is required, with people being advised to move family, pets and cars to safety.</p>
      <p>It is one level below a severe warning - which means danger to life - and one above a flood alert, which states flooding is possible.</p>
      <p>The current flood warnings are for the following areas:</p>
      <h3>River Trent at Carlton on Trent including Beck Cottage</h3>
      <p>River levels remain high at the Torksey river gauge as a result of high tides coinciding with high river levels. Consequently, the risk of flooding continues today and on subsequent high tides until Sunday morning, November 17.</p>
      <p>Areas most at risk are Carlton on Trent including Beck Cottage. Further light rainfall is forecast over the next 24 hours.</p>
      <h3>River Trent at Collingham</h3>
      <p>River levels remain high at the Torksey river gauge as a result of high tides coinciding with high river levels. Consequently, the risk of flooding continues today and on subsequent high tides until Sunday morning, November 17.</p>
      <p>The area most at risk is Collingham. Further light rainfall is forecast over the next 24 hours.</p>
      <h3>River Trent at Dunham-on-Trent</h3>
      <p>River levels remain high at the Torksey river gauge as a result of high tides coinciding with high river levels. Consequently, the risk of flooding remains.</p>

      <p>Areas most at risk are the A57 Dunham Road Bridge at Dunham-on-Trent. Property is not expected to flood at this stage. Further light rainfall is forecast over the next 24 hours. River levels are expected to remain high through the weekend.</p>
      <h3>River Trent at Girton</h3>
      <p>River levels remain high at the Torksey river gauge as a result of high tides coinciding with high river levels. Consequently, the risk of flooding continues today until Sunday morning, November 17. The area most at risk is Girton. Further light rainfall is forecast over the next 24 hours.</p>
      <h3>River Trent at Newark Tolney Lane and Riverside Marinas</h3>
      <p>River levels are high but steady at the Farndon river gauge as a result of heavy rainfall. Consequently, the risk of flooding remains. Areas most at risk are Tolney Lane Caravan Site and riverside marinas in Newark.</p>
      <p>Further light rainfall is forecast over the next 12 hours. River levels are expected to remain high until Sunday evening November 17.</p>
      <h3>River Trent at Sawley Marina, including Sawley Lock</h3>
      <p>River levels are rising slowly at the Shardlow and Church Wilne river gauge as a result of heavy rainfall. Consequently, the risk of flooding remains. Areas most at risk are Sawley Marina including Sawley Lock, and the B6540 Tamworth Road at Sawley. Further light rainfall is forecast over the next 12 hours.</p>
      <h3>Travel</h3>
      <p>Travel disruption is also still in place following flooding earlier in the week.</p>
      <p>East Midlands Railway has announced an amended timetable is still in place on its Matlock, Nottingham and Newark route. This is due to a fault on the signalling system, which was caused by Thursday's flooding.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a power outage is also affecting the Victoria Centre bus station in Nottingham. The station is still open but the travel centre has had to be closed. Engineers are working on fixing the issue.</p>
