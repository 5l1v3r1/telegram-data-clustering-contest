      <p>Joe Gomez and Jordan Henderson are to miss England’s final Euro 2020 qualifier in Kosovo on Sunday due to illness and injury respectively.</p>

      <p>A statement from the FA said: “Jordan Henderson and Joe Gomez will miss England’s final Euro 2020 qualifier in Kosovo on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“Henderson arrived in camp with a viral infection that has not fully cleared. Meanwhile, his Liverpool team-mate Gomez sustained a knock in training on Friday and has not recovered sufficiently enough to travel.</p>

      <p>“The pair now return to their club meaning the Three Lions will head to Pristina on Saturday with a 23-man squad.”</p>
      <p>England sealed their qualification for next summer’s tournament against Montenegro on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>However, England’s 1,000th international was overshadowed by the boos that greeted Gomez when he came on as a second-half substitute.</p>
      <p>Gomez was left with a scratch on his face following a confrontation with Raheem Sterling this week at St George’s Park. The Manchester City star was subsequently dropped from the squad to face Montenegro.</p>
