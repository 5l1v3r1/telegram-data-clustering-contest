      <h3>THE Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) yesterday said the present situation in Hong Kong does not warrant an evacuation as Filipinos in the region remain safe and are largely unaffected by the ongoing protests.</h3>
      <p>The statement was issued to refute articles circulating on social media that were only meant to create confusion.</p>
      <p>“The DFA wishes to assure everyone that (contrary to some false reports circulating in social media) Filipinos in Hong Kong remain safe and are largely unaffected by the ongoing protests in the area,” the DFA said.</p>
      <p>“Hence, the DFA sees no need to evacuate them at this time,” the DFA stressed.</p>
      <p>“ The Philippine Consulate General in Hong Kong is closely monitoring the situation and is taking every step to ensure the continued safety and well-being of our nationals there,” the DFA added.</p>
      <p>Those wishing to follow the developments in Hong Kong of Filipinos there are advised to visit the Consulate’s website for updates and advisories, instead of turning to questionable sources of information in the social media.</p>
      <p>Currently, there are 130,000 Filipinos working in Hong Kong mostly as household service workers.</p>
