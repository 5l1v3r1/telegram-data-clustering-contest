      <p>Great Britain’s underwhelming tour of the southern hemisphere came to a humiliating end when they were condemned to a 28-10 defeat by Papua New Guinea.</p>
      <p>The Lions raced into an early 10-0 lead but conceded a try on the stroke of half-time to give the Kumuls a sniff and they capitulated in alarming fashion in a dreadful second half as their hosts ran in four tries without reply.</p>
      <p>Great Britain, whose brand was revived in eager anticipation after a 12-year absence, struggled to cope with the humidity of Port Moresby and the physical challenge of the Kumuls as they succumbed to only a second defeat by Papua New Guinea.</p>
      <p>The result, which followed an opening defeat by a Tongan Invitational XIII and a two-match Test series loss to the Kiwis, piles the pressure on beleaguered head coach Wayne Bennett, whose contract with the Rugby Football League has now expired.</p>
      <p>Bennett has spoken of his desire to take England into the 2021 World Cup but it is difficult to see how can survive a disastrous tour, culminating in a thrashing by a team containing just two NRL regulars and two who play in the third tier of the English game.</p>
      <p>The Lions got off to the worst possible start, losing captain James Graham with a head knock in the very first tackle, which meant an early introduction for Luke Thompson and less impact from the bench.</p>
      <p>Yet it was a promising opening quarter from the tourists, with makeshift winger Blake Austin involved in most of the early play and it was the Warrington stand-off who opened the scoring after 14 minutes, taking Jake Connor’s pass to dive over at the corner.</p>
      <p>It looked to be plain sailing for Bennett’s men when hooker Josh Hodgson squeezed over for a second try after 21 minutes and Gareth Widdop added the conversion to extend their lead to 10-0.</p>
      <p>The scores subdued the passionate capacity crowd at the national stadium but the Kumuls provided a hint of their threat when winger Edene Gebbie went close and they struck in stoppage time when substitute Edwin Ipape scored a breakaway try that turned the game.</p>
      <p>Kyle Laybutt’s conversion cut Britain’s lead to just four points and the home side hit the front early in the second half when scrum-half Watson Boas beat Jermaine McGillvary to touch down a grubber kick from Gebbie and captain Rhyse Martin added the goal.</p>
      <p>It got even worse for the Lions five minutes later when centre Justin Olam touched down Laybutt’s kick on the last tackle and Martin’s goal made it 18-10.</p>
      <p>And there was no way back for Britain when Boas, who plays for League One club Doncaster, re-gathered his own kick to send full-back Alex Johnston over for his side’s fourth try after 56 minutes.</p>
      <p>The Lions’ misery was complete when second-rower Nixon Putt pounced on a rare blunder from full-back Jonny Lomax to grab his side’s fifth try after 65 minutes and Martin kicked his third goal.</p>
