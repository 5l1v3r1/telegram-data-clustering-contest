      <h1>Paul Merson slams ’embarrassing’ Pep Guardiola and Manchester City, stating the Premier League title is won</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T10:25:45+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 10:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/mattaddison/" target="_blank">Matt Addison</a></address>
      <p>Former Arsenal hero Paul Merson has slammed Pep Guardiola and Manchester City, claiming that they have been ’embarrassed’ by Liverpool so far this season, and that the Reds already have the Premier League title wrapped up.</p>
      <p>Merson says not enough questions are being asked of the Spaniard, who has now lost three league matches already this campaign. His Manchester City side currently occupy fourth spot in the table, behind both Chelsea and Leicester City.</p>
      <p>Writing for the <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/paul-merson-blasts-gareth-southgate-20891101">Daily Star</a>, he explained: <b>“The title race is over so you might as well crown Liverpool champions now. Do I think City can come back from nine points behind? No chance. Liverpool have lost once in about 52 games.</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>“They would have to lose three times before the end of the season and that’s without City losing a game. Can anyone see that happening?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“If Liverpool win it by eight or nine points that’s running away with it for me. But double digits would be embarrassing for City. It’s already embarrassing to see them in fourth.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“City have spent so much money. How are they nine points behind Liverpool already? Serious questions should be asked.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>Manchester City play Chelsea on Saturday evening at the Etihad Stadium, by which time they could be 12 points off the summit should the Reds beat Crystal Palace earlier in the day.</p>
      <p>They also have a tough few games coming up, with fixtures scheduled against the likes of Manchester United, Arsenal, Leicester and Wolves in the league.</p>
      <p>Nothing is done and dusted just yet but there can be no doubting who the best side in the country is at the moment. The Reds are head and shoulders above the others right now – but that needs to continue for another few months for it to mean anything.</p>
