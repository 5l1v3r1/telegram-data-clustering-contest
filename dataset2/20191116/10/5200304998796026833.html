      <p>Amazon Prime Video celebrates one year of it’s popular original series ‘Mirzapur’ with a sneak-peek into Season Two.</p>
      <p>Pankaj Tripathi, Mirzapur’s Kaleen Bhaiya joins in on the celebrations by making his Instagram debut to interact with the show’s super fans.</p>
      <p>Tripathi said, “It has been a year to Mirzapur, and what a year it has been! Mirzapur is the show that got me universal love and acclaim from the audience. The show has become iconic to the point that wherever I go, I hear fans addressing me as Kaleen Bhaiya. Amazon Prime Video has presented the show in a fantastic manner. There’s a lot of anticipation amongst fans for the next season and I’m often asked when it will release. I too am excited about season two so it is just fitting for me to make my Instagram debut on the first birthday of Mirzapur and give my and the show’s fans a little tease into what is to come!”</p>
