      <p>The new-look Davis Cup will kick off on Monday with 18 teams battling it out for the trophy in Madrid.</p>
      <p>A radical overhaul of the historic competition has largely done away with the home and away format, and the finals will be played on indoor hard courts at the Caja Magica.</p>
      <p>Here, the PA news agency picks out five talking points for the week.</p>
      <h3>Atmosphere</h3>

      <h3>Format</h3>

      <p>Twenty-five ties will be crammed into seven days, with the 18 teams split into six groups. The group winners plus two best runners-up will progress to the quarter-finals on Thursday and Friday, before the semi-finals and final are played out over the weekend. Traditionally, World Group ties consisted of four singles rubbers and one doubles, all best-of-five sets. Here, ties are made up of two singles rubbers and one doubles, all best-of-three sets. Whether some of the drama is lost, and whether doubles remains central to the narrative, are two of the big questions.</p>
      <h3>Match-ups</h3>

      <p>The impetus behind the switch to a World Cup-style event was to try to encourage the leading players to return to the event, with the commitment of top-20 players increasingly poor. Organisers would have been very pleased to see most of the eligible top names present when the teams were announced last month. One black mark against the competition was that, under the old format, there was not a single meeting between the ‘big four’ of Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray. The latter three are all expected to represent their countries in Madrid.</p>
      <h3>The Pique factor</h3>

      <p>The stakes would be high anyway but are even higher because of the looming shadow of the ATP Cup. The ATP and the International Tennis Federation, which oversees Davis Cup, have been engaged in a power struggle that has resulted in two near identical competitions being held within six weeks of each other. The new ATP Cup will take place in Australia in January, boasting big prize money and ranking points. Perceived wisdom is that only one event can survive in the long term. An underwhelming Davis Cup could put its future at risk.</p>
