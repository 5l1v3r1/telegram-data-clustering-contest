      <p>A British Army soldier and his wife are appealing for birthday cards for their unwell daughter who is preparing to undergo her 10th brain surgery.</p>
      <p>Lyla O'Donovan, from near Durham, turns seven on 28 November and was just three years old when she was diagnosed with a brain tumour.</p>
      <p>Since then, she has suffered from other illnesses and complications. </p>

      <p>Lyla's father, Corporal Paul O'Donovan, said: "Despite the tumour being low-grade, her future is uncertain and, as parents, my wife Kirsty and I are desperately trying to stay strong for Lyla and our five other children.”</p>
      <p>In November 2018, doctors advised the O'Donovan family to "go and make memories", as they were running out of treatment options for Lyla. </p>
      <p>Despite her illness, Lyla has tried to help other children facing life-changing challenges.</p>
      <p>Alongside her older sister, she set up 'Lyla and Lilley's Stars' to send 'certificates of bravery' to other sick children around the world.</p>

      <p>Last month, her work was recognised when she was presented with an award by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.</p>
      <p>"Lyla’s brought so much joy and recognition to other young people around the world," said Corporal O'Donovan, who serves with 8 Rifles.</p>
      <p>"It would be amazing if, in return, her birthday wish could come true.</p>
      <p>“Lyla will be back in hospital just after Christmas to undergo her 10th brain operation.</p>
      <p>"She is so brave and never complains, in spite of all she has been through. She is so deserving of some extra love and well wishes on her big day.”</p>

      <p>Brain tumours kill more children and adults under the age of 40 than any other cancer, according to Brain Tumour Research.</p>
      <p>The charity has been working alongside the O'Donovan family to raise awareness of the disease.  </p>
      <p>The family have already received some "unexpected" cards but are hoping more will arrive in the coming weeks. </p>
      <p>Details on how to send a card can be found on Lyla's social media accounts under the handle '@LylasJourney1'.</p>
