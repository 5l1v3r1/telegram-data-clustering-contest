      <h1>Britain's Prince Andrew speaks over his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein</h1>

        <b>The British royal Prince Andrew has spoken publicly for the first time about his relationship with convicted US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The son of Queen Elizabeth II says he "let the side down" as a member of the British royal family.</p>
      <p>The scandal involving the American billionaire and allegations against the prince have led Buckingham Palace to issue a number of unexpected statements in the past four years - denying the prince had sex with a 17-year-old girl and that he knew anything of Epstein's crimes against underage girls.</p>
      <p>In an interview with BBC's Newsnight, due to be aired on Saturday, he was asked about why he stayed with Epstein after the billionaire had admitted having sex with an underage girl.</p>
      <p>Prince Andrew said: "I stayed with him and that's... that, as it were, I kick myself for on a daily basis because it was not something that was becoming of a member of the royal family and we try and uphold the highest standards and practices and I let the side down, simple as that."</p>

      <p>Video taken in 2010 showed Prince Andrew looking out of the door of Epstein's mansion in New York as he was staying with the billionaire.</p>
      <p>It was two years after Epstein had been convicted of having sex with underage girls. Photos were also taken of the two men walking in Central Park.</p>
      <p>Those close to the prince say he had gone to America to tell Epstein that they could no longer be friends.</p>
      <p>In the interview, he is also asked about allegations made by one of Epstein's victims - Virginia Roberts - who claims she was made to have sex with Prince Andrew when she was 17-years-old, after a night out in London.</p>

      <p>When asked for his response to those claims he said: "I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever."</p>
      <p>When asked: "You don't remember meeting her?" He replied: "No".</p>
      <p>As Epstein faced trial in America this summer and then killed himself in a Manhattan jail, the scandal again erupted around Prince Andrew.</p>
      <p>On Twitter, Prince Andrew ex-wife Sarah Ferguson said: "It is so rare to meet people that are able to speak from their hearts with honesty+pure real truth, that remain steadfast and strong to their beliefs.</p>
      <p>"Andrew is a true+real gentleman and is stoically steadfast to not only his duty but also his kindness + goodness".</p>

      <p>Lawyers acting for Epstein's victims still have questions about what the prince and Epstein's other high-profile friends knew about the billionaire's crimes.</p>
      <p>Prince Andrew has denied witnessing or suspecting any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to Epstein's arrest and conviction.</p>
