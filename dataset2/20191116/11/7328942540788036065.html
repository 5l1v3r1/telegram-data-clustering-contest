      <p>When it comes to bringing fiction to life, no one does it better than mad inventor YouTuber Colin Furze. We have seen him make <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/mad-inventor-creates-badass-wolverine-claws-whoa">Wolverine's claws</a> as well as <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/mad-inventor-does-it-again-with-terrifying-wrist-mounted-flame-thrower">wrist-mounted flame throwers</a>.</p>
      <p>Now he has built a real Junkrat RIP-tire weapon from <i>Overwatch. </i>The weapon was made at the request of some viewers which are big fans of the game.</p>
      <p>And Furze did not disappoint. He started with a tire and put a chainsaw engine in it.</p>
      <p>He cut and retrofitted the chainsaw engine to fit perfectly in the tire. He also fitted it with a remote control to control where it heads.</p>
      <p>In the end, Furze took the tire out for a test run and watched it run over some grass. The question remains, can it behave like a weapon?</p>
      <p>Luckily for all, that's a question Furze does not answer doing little more than watching the tire ride around. What do you think of this DIY project? A little bit of fun or a dangerous endeavour?</p>
