      <h1>Navodhana Samiti split over women’s entry issue</h1>
      <h2>KPMS takes exception to the government’s “modified” position</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T11:27:20+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 11:27</time> by <a rel="author">Special Correspondent</a></address>
      <p>The Left Democratic Front (LDF) government’s stance that it was under no legal obligation to escort women to Sabarimala appeared to have opened a rift in the State-sponsored Navodhana Samrakshana Samiti (renaissance protection committee).</p>
      <p>Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had formed the Samiti in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha election, purportedly to counter what the government perceived as a dangerous right-wing drift in society.</p>
      <p>The general secretary of the Samiti and president of Kerala Pulayar Maha Sabha (KPMS), one of the largest Dalit organisations in the State, Punnala Sreekumar, took strong exception to the government’s “modified” position.</p>
      <p>He said the apex court had not set aside its 2018 verdict upholding the right of women of all ages to worship at the Ayyappa temple. By backing away from its legal obligations, the LDF government had handed its critics a victory.</p>
      <h3>Minister’s take</h3>
      <p>Devaswom Board Minister Kadakampally Surendran stated on Thursday that it was not contingent on the administration to allow women activists at Sabarimala unless they arrived with a warrant from the Supreme Court for the State’s assistance.</p>
      <p>Mr. Sreekumar said the V.S. Achuthanandan government in 2007 and later the Pinarayi Vijayan government in 2016 had filed affidavits in the Supreme Court stating that age or gender should be no bar for women to worship at Sabarimala.</p>
      <p>The LDF’s stance had dovetailed with the universal covenant of gender equality and renaissance values enshrined in the Constitution.</p>
      <h3>Gender equality</h3>
      <p>The government’s changed position on Sabarimala gravely undermined the renaissance ideal of gender equality that led to the formation of the Samiti against the backdrop of the mustering of reactionary forces to thwart the government’s implementation of the court’s decision, he said.</p>
      <p>In stark contrast, the general secretary of the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP) Yogam and chairman of the Samiti Vellappally Natesan backed the government’s latest view that the State was under no juridical obligation to escort women between the age of 10 and 50 to Sabarimala.</p>
      <p>Mr. Natesan interpreted Supreme Court’s latest ruling to refer the slew of legal questions regarding the case to a seven-member constitutional bench as a “stay” on the 2018 order.</p>
