      <h1>2020 Toyota Supra Totaled After Just 500 Miles</h1>
      <h2>This new Toyota Supra had a tragically short life.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T11:35:53+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 11:35</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Bigg</a></address>
      <p>After years of anticipation, the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/toyota/supra">2020 Toyota GR Supra</a> is finally here, but high demand has resulted in some outrageous dealer markups. Alternatively, this white Supra listed for sale by the <a href="https://www.iaai.com/VehicleDetails?itemid=34076535&amp;RowNumber=2&amp;similarVehicleItemId=&amp;isNext=&amp;loadRecent=true">IAAI </a>(Insurance Auto Auctions) Long Island, NY, will probably be considerably cheaper, but there's a big catch. Let's just say it's seen better days.</p>
      <p>Tragically, this Supra only survived 576 miles before it became a mangled wreck. We don't know how the accident happened or if anyone was injured, but the impact looks severe judging from the extensive damage to the sports car's front end.</p>

      <p>The hood is badly crumpled, and the front fascia has been completely ripped off. Photos of the interior also show that several airbags deployed during the crash.</p>
      <p>According to the sale listing, the smashed-up Supra had a cash value of $54,661, while the cost to repair the damage is estimated to be $41,583. That's nearly as much as a brand-new 2020 Toyota GR Supra, since the base model starts at $49,990. There's no starting price for the auction at the time of writing, however. With a lot of work, it could be possible to salvage the car, but the chances are someone will use it for spare parts.</p>

      <p>To make matters worse, the example for sale is the limited Launch Edition, which starts at $55,250 and includes red mirror caps, unique black wheels, and red leather accents. Good luck finding one for this price though, because the short supply and high demand for the model has resulted in some outrageous markups. Recently, for example, a dealership in Alabama tried to sell a Launch Edition for $167,000, which is $111,750 more than the starting price.</p>
      <p>Sadly, this isn't the first time someone has wrecked a 2020 Toyota GR Supra, and it won't be the last. We've seen some overconfident drivers <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/someone-has-already-crashed-a-2020-toyota-supra-at-the-nurburgring">lose control of the Japanese sports car at the Nurburgring</a>, and the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/watch-this-now-wrecked-toyota-supras-final-moments">wrecked remains of another example</a> were listed on the same auction website just last month.</p>
