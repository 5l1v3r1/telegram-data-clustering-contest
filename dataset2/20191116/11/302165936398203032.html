      <h1>Report: Anwar won’t meet warring factions, dares party to pick new president</h1>

      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 16 — Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim has reportedly refused to meet the factions embroiled in a fresh feud involving his deputy Datuk Seri Azmin Ali, whose invitation to open a PKR youth congress was recently rescinded.</p>
      <p><i>Malaysiakini</i> reported Anwar as saying he is against endorsing any attempts by the different factions to hold separate meetings, but will not prevent them from doing so.</p>
      <p>“I will not hold meetings with different factions,” he was quoted as saying at the Perlis and Kedah divisions’ joint convention in Kulim this afternoon.</p>
      <p>“I will hold a party meeting... If you want me to meet and legitimise certain groups, that is not the work of the president.</p>
      <p>“You have to wait to elect a new president if you dare.”</p>
      <p>Anwar was also said to have used the term “cartel” in a reference to the meetings.</p>
      <p>The term is said to describe Azmin’s faction among the PKR president’s supporters. </p>
      <p><i>Malaysiakini</i> suggested this was likely the first time Anwar had used the description publicly.</p>
      <p>Last week the party’s Youth wing said it would not have Azmin officiate its congress next month, a move that revived the simmering tension between him and Anwar.</p>
      <p>The PKR deputy president, once Anwar’s blue-eyed boy but is now a close ally of Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, in response claimed the move was meant to “silence” him.</p>
      <p>But both leaders have so far downplayed the rift. </p>
      <p>Today, <i>Malaysiakini </i>reported Anwar denying claims that he would not meet Azmin or leaders alligned to him.</p>
      <p>“In Parliament, I often drop by the canteen... then I go to my office upstairs, where those with appointments meet me,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Anyone can meet me. On other days, I am at my office in Jalan Gasing [Petaling Jaya]. So it is not true to say [they] cannot meet me. What more if you are a minister or deputy minister.</p>
      <p>“But if party meetings have been fixed, political bureau meetings, central leadership council meetings or special meetings, then there is no such thing as [secretary-general Datuk Saifuddin Nasution Ismail’s] faction or cartel faction. I will not endorse this,” he added.</p>
