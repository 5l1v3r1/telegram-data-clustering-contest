      <h1>The latest on Mo Salah’s injury as he faces a race against time to feature at Crystal Palace</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T11:10:54+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 11:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/mattaddison/" target="_blank">Matt Addison</a></address>
      <p>Mo Salah has not yet been ruled out of making a return to action in time to face Crystal Palace next Saturday despite ongoing trouble with his ankle.</p>
      <p>The Egyptian will not feature for his country during this international break and there has been some suggestions that he will miss up to four weeks through injury.</p>
      <p>The Reds will take no risks with the winger as they look to get him fit for a crucial part of the season, but as <a href="https://theathletic.com/1381703/2019/11/15/live-qa-discuss-the-latest-at-liverpool-with-our-reporter-james-pearce-fri-15th-nov-4pm-gmt-11am-et/">The Athletic</a> have explained, Salah has been struggling with the injury for a while.</p>
      <p>It might be best that he doesn’t play at Selhurst Park, giving maximum recovery time.</p>
      <p>James Pearce wrote in a Q&amp;A: <b>“My information is that Salah is a doubt for Crystal Palace away but he hasn’t been ruled out of that game yet. It all depends how he responds to the treatment. With the schedule LFC have got coming up, they won’t take any risks with him.”</b></p>
      <p>Salah has netted six times and provided three assists in 11 Premier League games so far this season.</p>
      <p>Divock Origi is a decent alternative when he is not available to start games, but there is no doubt a drop-off in ability when the Belgian comes in to replace him. That would also require Sadio Mane to move across from the left, where he is best, and onto the right, to accommodate him.</p>
