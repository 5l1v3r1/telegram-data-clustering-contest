      <p>According to the news outlet IRNA, protests have been reported in Mashhad, Shiraz, Ahvaz and several other cities, including Sirjan, where people tried to <a href="https://sputniknews.com/interviews/201911081077256811-europe-must-ensure-iran-oil-exports--bank-transactions--iranian-deputy-fm/">set a local oil storage facility on fire</a> but were stopped by police.</p>
      <p>According to preliminary reports, one person has died during clashes in the city of Sirjan.</p>
      <p>On Friday, Tehran introduced quotas for retail sales of gasoline and subsequently increased prices.</p>
      <p>The move envisages that owners of private cars will be able to purchase 60 litres (13.2 gallons) of gasoline per month, while owners of dual-fuel cars will be able to purchase 30 litres. A separate quota is also provided for taxi drivers — they can use 400 litres of gasoline. A quota for motorcyclists is set at 25 litres, and there are also quotas for trucks and ambulances.</p>

      <p>​The price for a litre of gasoline within the quota doubled to 15,000 Iranian rials per litre (about $0.36). Each additional litre of gasoline beyond the quota costs 30,000 rials per litre.</p>
      <p>In February, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zangeneh said that <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201911101077270392-iran-discovers-new-oilfield-containing-53-billion-barrels-of-crude-president-rouhani-says/">Iran's gasoline production had grown over 100 percent since 2013,</a> adding that the country could have even become a petrol exporter, but was currently accumulating reserves of the product.  </p>
