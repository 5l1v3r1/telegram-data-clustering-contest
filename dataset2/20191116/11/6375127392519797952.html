      <h3>AN opposition solon asked the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) and the Philippine National Police (PNP) to cooperate with Vice President Leni Robredo, who was appointed as co-chair of an agency handling the administration’s drug war.</h3>
      <p>In a statement, Albay Rep. Edcel Lagman said the delaying tactics of both PDEA and PNP in the release of accurate information on illegal drugs is keeping Robredo from fulfilling her task.</p>
      <p>“Concerned agencies like PDEA and PNP cannot blindfold Vice President Leni Robredo in her new role as anti-drug czar and push her to the precipice by denying her the accurate information on illegal drugs,” Lagman said.</p>
      <p>Lagman said policy reorientation on the anti-narcotics campaign must be data and evidence-based.</p>
      <p>According to the veteran solon, Robredo’s request for a copy of the list of high value targets and drug addicts is essential and not beyond comprehension.</p>
      <p>“These data, including the authentic list of casualties in the brutal war on drugs, are indispensable in pursuing non-violent and innovative strategies in the anti-illegal drugs campaign,” Lagman said.</p>
      <p>“What makes the narco list inordinately sacrosanct that it should be held close to the chest of PDEA’s Director General Aaron Aquino and Robredo’s co-chair in the Inter-Agency Committee on Anti-Illegal Drugs (ICAD)?” he asked.</p>
      <p>The solon said that without these empirical data, the Vice President will be galloping blindly on a redirected anti-drugs drive.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Robredo requested from the PDEA the data about war on drugs under President Rodrigo Duterte’s administration.</p>
      <p>The Vice President also wanted Oplan Tokhang to be abolished, charging innocent people were being killed.</p>
