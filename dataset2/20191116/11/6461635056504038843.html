      <h3>Real Madrid have managed to lure one of Barcelona’s primary targets for 2020 into their own roster by reportedly agreeing to personal terms.</h3>
      <p>Barcelona and Real Madrid have been pursuing a mutual target since the last few weeks in Napoli superstar Fabian Ruiz. The Spain international is one of the most promising midfielders in the world and has done a very good job under Carlo Ancelotti in the Serie A over the course of the last year or so.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.diariogol.com/real-madrid/florentino-perez-se-lo-quita-a-messi-8-millones-5-anos-y-cerrado-para-zidane-y-el-real-madrid_20010671_102.html"><b>Diario GOL has now reported</b></a> that Real Madrid have closed in on the signing of the former Real Betis midfielder in a quick process and will be getting their hands on the attacking midfielder in the next summer. The Whites have offered Fabian Ruiz a wage of 8 million euros per year, while Barca are yet to even officially discuss anything about the player.</p>
      <p>Los Merengues have possibly signed a player who will be a major asset for their approach of planning for the future by signing younger players, and more importantly a great replacement for Luka Modric. Zinedine Zidane will inherit a young player in his squad who does get in on the act quite often, so it’s a major loss for Barcelona.</p>
      <p>Ernesto Valverde’s side does boast the likes of Frenkie de Jong and Arthur Melo in its roster, but there is a major chance of the Barca boss losing both, Arturo Vidal and Ivan Rakitic over the next calendar year. Both the midfielders are not getting much play time and have made it clear that they want to be featuring regularly towards the end of their careers.</p>
      <p>The Blaugrana have had the last week to mend themselves from some disappointing results and will look to do in the coming days as well before travelling to Leganes next weekend for their La Liga fixture. Following the trip to Madrid, the Catalans have two season defining fixtures versus Borussia Dortmund and Atletico Madrid in store.</p>
      <p>Who do you think Barca should eye with Fabian Ruiz probably heading to Real Madrid?</p>
