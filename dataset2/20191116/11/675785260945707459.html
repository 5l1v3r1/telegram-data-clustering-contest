      <p>“Lads night at #hfpa party with @therealaladewale @iamjamiefoxx and @jsauluck,” she wrote as she shared photos of herself posing alongside the trio of men.</p>
      <p>“I would like to point out that standing next to someone does not mean I am dating them,” she added.</p>
      <p>She then jokingly quipped: “Currently in line at the dry cleaners and if that’s true I’ve got a hell of a problem.”</p>

      <p>Fans were quick to comment on Kate’s amusing statement - with one asking if “dry cleaning guy not classy enough?” to which she quickly retorted: “12 ppl right here.”</p>
      <p>Another speculated she inappropriately touched Jamie at the moment the photo was taken, writing: “It does look like you are grabbing his bits behind the glorious fruit bowl…”</p>
      <p>But the actress slammed the comment, writing: “There literally isn’t even a fruit bowl. I think you need a moment to yourself.”</p>

      <p>Kate is back on the dating scene after her divorce from Underworld director Len Wiseman was finalised this week following the pair splitting back in 2015.</p>
      <p>She has been linked to comedians Pete Davidson, 26, and Matt Rife, 24.</p>
      <p>Kate was previously in a long-term relationship with 50-year-old Welshman Michael Sheen between 1995 and 2003, with whom she shares a daughter, Lily, who was born in 1999.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Jamie is said to also be single after his on-off romance with Dawson's Creek legend Katie Holmes, 40, ended this year.</p>
