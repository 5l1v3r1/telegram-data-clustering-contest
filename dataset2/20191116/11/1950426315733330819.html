        <b>The Pentagon’s DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) wants to be able to spread genetically modified bacteria as “explosives sensors.” The United States government could very well be looking into ways to militarize microbes.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Pentagon has teamed up with Raytheon for this project, which seems like it should <b>come straight out of a dystopian science</b> fiction story. The government wants to develop a system capable of delivering genetically modified bacteria underground, <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/473281-darpa-bioengineered-bacteria-sensor/">according to a report by <i>RT</i></a>.</p>
      <p>Initiated by DARPA, the same agency that led programs to create telekinetic super soldiers and weaponized robotic insects, the project <i><b>seeks to “program two bacterial strains to monitor ground surfaces for explosive materials,”</b></i> defense contractor Raytheon said in a joint <a href="http://raytheon.mediaroom.com/2019-11-12-Raytheon-developing-microscopic-bomb-detector">press release</a> with the Worcester Polytechnic Institute.</p>

      <p>So the genetically modified bacteria are for your own good!</p>
      <blockquote>The first of the two strains, known as a “bio-sensor,” will “detect the presence or absence of explosives buried underground,” while the second will produce a “glowing light” in the event such materials are found. Remotely operated cameras or drones would then be sent to survey the area to find the glowing germs, and ultimately the buried explosives. –<a href="https://www.rt.com/news/473281-darpa-bioengineered-bacteria-sensor/"><i>RT</i></a></blockquote>
      <p>“<b>We already know that some bacteria can be programmed</b> to be very good at detecting explosives, but it’s harder underground,” said Raytheon researcher Allison Taggart. “We’re investigating how to transport the reporting bacteria to the required depth underground.”</p>

      <p>Though the Pentagon claims it <b>only plans to use the system for <i>“</i>defensive<i>”</i> purposes only,</b> some may find the idea of militarized microbes off-putting while conjuring apocalyptic scenarios of a runaway<a href="https://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/darpa-can-exterminate-humanity-you-could-feasibly-wipe-out-the-human-race_12142017"> genetically engineered superbug</a>.</p>

      <p><b>DARPA has undertaken some projects that should raise the alarm in many.</b>  However, it almost seems as though we’ve reached a point where the masses don’t care what’s being done to them, in their name, and with the money stolen from them. And these are just a few of the things we know DARPA is working on.</p>
