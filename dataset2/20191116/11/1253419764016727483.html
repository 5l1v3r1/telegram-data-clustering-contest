      <p>Grinding Gear Games has officially announced Path of Exile 2. However, will not be a separate/standalone game. Instead, Path of Exile 2 will overhaul the mechanics and engine of the base game, and introduce some new elements to it. Basically, think of it as a huge expansion that will also enhance the base game.</p>
      <p>Path of Exile 2 is a new seven-act storyline that will be available alongside the original Path of Exile 1 campaign. Moreover, both the old and new storyline lead to the same shared Atlas endgame. Path of Exile 2 will retain all expansion content that Grinding Gear released for the first game. It will also introduce a new skill system, ascendancy classes, engine improvements and more.</p>
      <p>According to the team, Path of Exile 2 will feature a massively improved engine for graphics &amp; physics. Furthermore, the game will have 19 new ascendancy classes. These characters are a new set of Exiles who fall into the same class archetypes as those in the original game.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, there is no ETA on when the game will come out. Still, you can find below its first gameplay trailer (as well as its announcement trailer).</p>
      <p>Enjoy!</p>
