      <p>Tony joked: "Happy to be signing autographs next to @claireking101 at the Emmerdale Fan Club Weekend."</p>
      <p>His co-stars were in hysterics at the picture with several sending laughing emojis in response.</p>
      <p>Dean Andrews (Will) replied: "Popular as ever Tony üòâ. It‚Äôll be the same for me tonight. At least folk know you üëçx."</p>
      <p>Louisa Clein (Maya Stepney) tweeted: "I'd be first in line for you @TonysTrials!!"</p>
      <p>Claire herself attempted to make Tony feel better by revealing she only had the crowds then because she was later than him.</p>
