      <p>While reviews on the 2013 movie “Parkland” were far from perfect, this Kennedy movie is great in that it gives us a completely different perspective on the <a href="https://www.irishcentral.com/news/jackie-kennedy-blamed-lyndon-b-johnson-for-jfk-murder-127220093-237788131">JFK assassination</a>, instead focusing on the lives of otherwise average everyday people who found themselves wrapped up in the drama. Produced by none other than Tom Hanks, the movie also stars Zac Efron, Colin Hanks, and Billy Bob Thornton.</p>

      <p>Many films about JFK focus on Dallas assassination released just five months before his death, “PT 109” highlighted to heroic actions of the young Kennedy in action. The film depicts the president when he was an officer of the United States Navy in command of Motor Torpedo Boat PT-109 during the Pacific War of World War II. <a href="https://www.irishcentral.com/roots/history/what-you-should-know-about-john-f-kennedy">Kennedy won a medal for bravery</a> for battling against a bad back to bring a comrade to safety when the boat was hit and sank.</p>

      <p>As soon as you start talking about <a href="https://www.irishcentral.com/roots/history/anniversary-of-jfk-s-assassination-the-nation-s-only-irish-catholic-president">a Kennedy assassination</a>, it won’t be long before somebody comes along with their own conspiracy theory or hot take on what really happened. There are plenty of JFK conspiracy theory movies out there but the 1991 thriller “JFK” starring Kevin Costner and Tommy Lee Jones is definitely the best of the bunch. The movie examines the events leading to the assassination of John F. Kennedy and alleged cover-up through the eyes of former New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison (played by Costner).</p>

      <p>Kevin Costner appeared in yet another Kennedy movie in 2000, this time taking on the role of political consultant Kenneth P. O'Donnell as he attempts to guide President John F. Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood) through the 13-day crisis that was the Cuban Missile Crisis.</p>

A winner for the history buffs, it deals with the assassination itself, the death of Lee Harvey Oswald, the Warren Commission, and the assassination of Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jnr.</p>

Memories of her husband’s death, her fight to create a legacy, and the horror of her grief and the social pressure of being such a massive public figure are played by Natalie Portman.</p>
