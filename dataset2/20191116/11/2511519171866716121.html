      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/kim-kardashian-west">Kim Kardashian West</a> has described the moment a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/DeathPenalty">death row</a> inmate whose case she has championed received a stay of execution.</p>
      <p>Kardashian West, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/kim-kardashian-lawyer-vogue-law-california-a8864266.html">who is studying for a career in law</a>, believes there is “substantial evidence” that would exonerate murder accused <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/rodney-reed">Rodney Reed</a>.</p>
      <p>Reed, 51, was facing death by lethal injection on Wednesday for the 1996 killing of a 19-year-old woman.</p>
      <p>On Friday, Texas's top criminal appeals court halted the execution following a high-profile campaign featuring celebrities including <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Beyonce">Beyonce</a> and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/OprahWinfrey">Oprah Winfrey</a> to have his case re-examined.</p>
      <p>Kardashian West revealed she was with Reed when the decision was announced and described the moment he discovered the news on <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/instagram">Instagram</a>.</p>
      <p>The reality star posted a photograph of Reed in prison, as he placed his hand on a pane of glass that separated the pair.</p>

      <p>“Today, I had the honour of meeting #RodneyReed in person and the privilege of sitting with him when he got the news that the highest court in Texas had issued a stay of execution and remanded the case back to the trial court for further consideration,” the caption read.</p>
      <p>"Words cannot describe the relief and hope that swept over the room in that moment. That hope had been building over the last few weeks around Rodney's case."</p>
      <p>Kardashian West continued by stating how Reed’s case had prompted “people all around the globe speak up” and thanked everyone for their support.</p>
      <p>“So grateful for the commitment and passion of everyone who voiced their support, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles for their recommendation to issue a 120 day reprieve, and the courts for issuing a stay!”</p>
      <p>Kardashian West is currently studying to become a criminal justice lawyer and is planning to take her exams in 2022.</p>
      <p>She has become increasingly involved in high-profile cases where supporters of the accused claim there has been a miscarriage of justice.</p>
      <p>The mother-of-four played a crucial role in the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/alice-johnson-kim-kardashian-trump-white-house-visit-commutes-sentence-a8386601.html">release of prisoner Alice Marie Johnson</a>, whose life sentence for drug offences was commuted last year.</p>
