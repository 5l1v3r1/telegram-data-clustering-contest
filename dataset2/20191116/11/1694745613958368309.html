      <h1>This Simple Storage Hack Keeps Lettuce Fresh For at Least a Week, and It's About Time</h1>

      <p>There's nothing worse than opening the fridge only to find that your lettuce has turned slimy. But keeping greens crisp and fresh all week can be difficult, which is especially tricky because I like to <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Healthy-Salad-Recipes-43261951">eat salads for lunch</a>. They're <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Salad-Meal-Prep-Ideas-44684579">super easy to make ahead</a> and, of course, really good for you. Usually I'll <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Meal-Prep-Beginners-45621602">cook a meat or fish prior to the start of the week</a> so I can throw the ingredients together quickly on busy mornings.</p>
      <p>The only thing my meal prep was lacking was consistently crisp lettuce, but after experimenting for several years, I think I've finally found a foolproof way to <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/food/How-Store-Greens-40245331">keep greens fresher longer</a>. Once I've cut up the greens and combined them (I love nutrient-rich spinach mixed with crunchy romaine), I use a supersimple storage method to keep them crisp.</p>
      <p>Instead of keeping greens in their original packaging or placing them in a plastic bag, I <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Best-Meal-Prep-Products-Amazon-45709266">use a storage container</a> — usually a fairly large one, as buying in bulk helps me save money, too. Then I line the bottom of the container with two layers of paper towels, add the mixed greens, and place another double layer of paper towels on top of the lettuce before sealing the lid and gliding it into the fridge. Voilà. That's it.</p>
      <p>Storing my salad greens this way keeps them fresh for at least a whole week, because the box gives them more room to breathe and the paper towels help suck up all the additional moisture from the leaves. This process has eliminated my midweek grocery trips — something I used to loathe. So, if you're looking for a way to avoid slimy, mushy salad greens, you should really try this!</p>
