      <p>Tired of mouldy bathroom tiles which take hours to clean?</p>
      <p>Trying to get rid of it can be incredibly tricky, but one woman claims to have found a solution.</p>
      <p>In a post on a cleaning tips and tricks <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> group, an unnamed woman revealed she'd found a simple hack for removing mould without doing an intense scrubbing - and it only cost around Â£2 to do.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/womans-tip-making-mouldy-shower-20875722">The Mirror</a> reports that the woman initially posted a photo of her mouldy grouting on the group, asking fellow members for suggestions on how to get them looking good as new.</p>
      <p>Many people responded to her post, sharing ideas, including using toilet bowl cleaner and just re-sealing the tiles.</p>
      <p>After trying a few of the hacks out, she finally found one that really did the trick, and all she needed were cotton wool and bleach to do it.</p>
      <p>The woman claims she soaked a pieces of the cotton wool in the cleaning product and packed them all around the edges of the tiles.</p>
      <p>The cotton wool was left on the tiles overnight and by the morning, the difference was incredible.</p>
      <p>She re-shared her original photo as well as a new one showing the results of the cleaning trick.</p>
      <p>"Thank you to everyone who has commented," she said. "I used cotton wool and bleach and have attached photos of the results. Wow!"</p>
      <p>Dozens of people liked her post, with one person commented: "This is amazing!"</p>
