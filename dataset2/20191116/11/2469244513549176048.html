      <p>Police are hunting for a masked man after an attempted knifepoint robbery in <a href="https://www.devonlive.com/news/all-about/torquay">Torquay</a> early this morning.</p>
      <p>An individual entered the McColl's shop on St Marychurch Road at Plainmoor at around 8.30am.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.devonlive.com/news/all-about/devon-and-cornwall-police">Devon and Cornwall Police</a> force incident manager, who oversees all live incidents in the region, said: "An individual entered the store, dressed pretty much all in black with a mask on.</p>
      <p>"They were in possession of a small knife and asked for contents of the till, which hasn't been handed over. They promptly left on foot.</p>
      <p>"Officers were dispatched and enquiries are ongoing. Officers are still at the scene making enquiries and conducting searches.</p>
      <p>"If anyone has any information or saw anyone around the McColl's shop on 155 St Marychurch Road, particularly a male in black at around 8.25am to 8.30am, we would ask them to get in touch quoting log number 257 of November 16."</p>
      <p>It is believed the shop remains closed at this time. Nobody answered the phone there.</p>
