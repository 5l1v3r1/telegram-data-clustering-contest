      <h3>SENATOR Sonny Angara assured that the new laws signed by President Rodrigo Duterte will be funded as the senators deliberate on the P4.1 trillion national budget for 2020.</h3>
      <p>Angara, the chairman of the Committee on Finance, said the laws would be useless unless they are given the appropriations they need for their implementation.</p>
      <p>Among these new laws is Republic Act 11194 or the Conservation of the Gabaldon School Buildings Act, which was signed by the President in January this year.</p>
      <p>In the committee report on the 2020 General Appropriations Bill, the Senate provided P616 million for the implementation of the law, which would be lodged under the budget of the Department of Education.</p>
      <p>For 2019, the DepEd received P2.06 billion for the implementation of RA 11194, but for the proposed 2020 national budget, the Executive gave the agency a mere P383.9 million.</p>
      <p>“These structures are considered part of Filipino heritage. They represent the roots of the public school system in the country. We must strive to preserve these buildings for the next generations to see and appreciate,” Angara said.</p>
      <p>During the American occupation between 1907 and 1946, around 3,000 Gabaldon school buildings were constructed across the country.</p>
      <p>There are now a little over 1,400 of these structures left standing due to years of neglect, decay and even demolition.</p>
      <p>The 2020 national budget would also contain an allocation of P1 billion for the implementation of Republic Act 11230 or the Tulong Trabaho Act, which was signed on February this year.</p>
      <p>Under the law, the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority will provide free access to Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET) particularly to out-of-school youth and the unemployed.</p>
      <p>The law provides for the establishment of a Tulong Trabaho Fund, which will finance the free training fees and additional financial aid such as transportation allowances for the qualified beneficiaries enrolling in selected training programs.</p>
      <p>“Daan-daan, kung hindi libu-libo na, ang nagtagumpay sa tulong ng TESDA kaya nararapat lang natin na suportahan ang batas na ito,” Angara said.</p>
