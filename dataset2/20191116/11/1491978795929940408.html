        <i>Lightly spiced and warming, these cinnamon and apple buns topped with toffee are never more delicious than when devoured straight from the oven</i>
      </p>
      <p>You know the November vibe: hearty, comforting, autumnal flavours. Apple, toffee, warming spices… They’re all here in these cinnamon-style buns, which are pretty simple to make, so get the whole family involved. They’re banging served warm from the oven.</p>
      <h3>Toffee apple buns</h3>
      <p>You will need a 12-hole muffin tin.</p>
      <p>Prep <b>1 hr</b><br/>Prove <b>2 hr+</b><br/>Cook <b>30 min</b><br/>Makes <b>12</b></p>
      <p><b>1 egg</b>, beaten<b> </b><br/><b>Oil</b>, for greasing</p>
      <p>For the dough<br/><b>110ml whole milk</b><br/><b>100g unsalted butter</b><br/><b>1 tsp fine sea salt </b><br/><b>250g strong white bread flour</b><br/><b>250g plain flour</b>, plus extra for dusting<br/><b>4 tbsp golden caster sugar </b><br/><b>10g fast-action dried yeast</b><br/><b>1 tsp ground cinnamon </b><br/><b>1 tsp ground cardamom</b><br/><b>2 large eggs</b>, beaten <br/><b>100g apple sauce or puree</b></p>
      <p>For the filling<br/><b>75g unsalted butter</b>, softened, plus extra for greasing<br/><b>150g soft light brown sugar </b><br/><b>¼ tsp freshly grated nutmeg </b><br/><b>2 tsp ground cinnamon </b><br/><b>½ tsp ground cloves<br/>100g raisins</b></p>
      <p>For the apples<br/><b>4 granny smith apples</b>, peeled, cored and chopped into chunks<br/><b>20g unsalted butter </b><br/><b>2 tbsp golden caster sugar </b><br/><b>½ tsp fine sea salt</b><br/><b>½ tsp ground cinnamon </b><br/><b>½ tsp ground cloves</b></p>
      <p>For the caramel sauce<br/><b>100g soft toffees</b><br/><b>4 tbsp double cream</b><br/><b>1 tsp vanilla extract</b></p>
      <p>To finish<br/><b>1 handful granola </b><br/><b>Icing sugar</b></p>
      <p>Warm the milk, butter and salt in a small saucepan, stirring constantly over a low heat, until the butter has melted. Remove from the heat and set aside until lukewarm.</p>
      <p>Combine the flours, sugar, yeast and spices in a large bowl (preferably the bowl of a stand mixer). Make a well in the centre, then add the eggs and apple sauce/puree. Pour the milk mix into the bowl, and knead using the dough hook attachment for eight minutes. Alternatively, stir everything until it comes together, then knead the dough on a lightly oiled surface until elastic and less sticky. Shape the dough into a ball, transfer to a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a clean tea towel and leave to prove until it has doubled in size – one to two hours.</p>
      <p>For the filling, mix the butter, sugar and spices to a smooth paste, and set aside.</p>
      <p>For the apples, pop them in a saucepan with the butter, sugar, salt and spices. Cook on a low-medium heat until the apple pieces are slightly tender.</p>
      <p>Once the dough has risen, tip it out on to a lightly floured surface, and roll into a 35cm x 25cm rectangle. Spread the spiced butter evenly over the dough with a palette or table knife, and top with the chopped apple and raisins.</p>
      <p>Starting with the longest edge closest to you, roll the dough into a cylinder, then cut into 12 even slices. Put each roll into the lined muffin tin cut side down, put in a large plastic bag and loosely close. Leave to prove at room temperature for 50 minutes, or until well risen.</p>
      <p>Heat the oven to 190C (180C fan)/gas 6. Brush the tops of the buns with beaten egg, bake for 15–20 minutes, until dark golden brown, then transfer to a wire rack to cool slightly.</p>
      <p>While the buns are cooling, put the toffees, double cream and vanilla in a small saucepan and heat gently, stirring constantly, until it forms a smooth sauce. Give each bun a good dousing of sauce, then sprinkle with the granola and a light dusting of icing sugar.</p>
