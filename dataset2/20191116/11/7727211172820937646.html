      <p>Bargain retailer Home Bargains has long been a favourite among shoppers thanks to its low prices and range of products.</p>
      <p>The Liverpool-based retailer opened its first store in Old Swan in 1976 by Tom Morris - the store is still in the family today.</p>
      <p>It even launched two years before rival store B&amp;M Bargains.</p>
      <p>It now stocks around 4,000 branded products so customers regularly get a surprise at the products they find in stores.</p>
      <p>Despite its regular deals there are ways you can save even more money at <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/shoppers-outraged-ridiculous-price-home-17254067">Home Bargains</a> - we've rounded up 22 tips and tricks which will help you on your next shopping trip.</p>

      <p>An insider from the store has now revealed how its customers can find out whether a bargain will be in stock next time they return to the shop, and it has to do with its price tags.</p>
      <p>As well as revealing the cost of an item, the price tags also reveal whether an item is a one-off or a regularly stocked product.</p>
      <p>Next time you visit Home Bargains take a look at the bottom corner you will see wither REG or ONE.</p>
      <p>REG stands for regular, meaning regular product which will be in stock the majority of the time, and restocked when they sell out however ONE stands for one off meaning if you want it then you are probably best buying it there and then.</p>
      <h3>2. Looking for a particular item? Head to its bigger stores</h3>
      <p>Like most retailers, Home Bargains' larger stores have much more choice. According to its website, it also says: "Many of our large stores receive daily stock replenishment, and the item you are looking for may be available on your next visit to store.</p>
      <p>"Our smaller stores however, receive less frequent deliveries."</p>
      <h3>3. But, don't be in a rush to get inside</h3>
      <p>Some of the best bargains are located near the front of the store.</p>
      <h3>4. Star buys</h3>
      <p>Located near the front of the store, they change weekly and include discounts on branded products.</p>
      <h3>5. Getting to Home Bargains early will pay off</h3>
      <p>New stock is often delivered at around 7.30am in the morning so it will always pay to get to your nearest store when it opens.</p>
      <h3>6. You'll be surprised at its food range</h3>
      <p>There is a mix of fresh fruit and veg alongside cupboard essentials and more.</p>
      <h3>7. Designer replicas</h3>
      <p>As well as savings its customers money on their regular food and homeware shops, Home Bargains is also known to stock items which look like designer products for much less.</p>
      <h3>8. You can even take a break during a shop at its larger stores</h3>
      <p>Most of its larger stores now have cafés and garden centres too.</p>
