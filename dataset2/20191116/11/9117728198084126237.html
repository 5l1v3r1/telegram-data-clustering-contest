      </p>

        <i>"We're just one point ahead of Toro Rosso and 18 behind Renault, so yeah, we were hoping to be fifth or fourth this year, so from that regard, it's a bit disappointing.</i>

      <p>Sergio Perez also agrees that the team have struggled to perform to the level that they wanted to and hopes that things will improve for next season. </p>
      <p><i>"I don't think we have achieved what we wanted this year,"</i> said Perez.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"It's been a disappointing season in a way. We knew it was not going to be great since the beginning but we kind of expected to be a bit more competitive by now.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"I think in the second half of the season we've been strong, in different circuits, different places, which is always positive.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"McLaren, in that midfield, has been very consistent, very strong, but I think we have been in the mix with all the others and we've scored a good amount of points since the summer break.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"There are a lot of positives to take, but the general picture is not where we want to be."</i>
      </p>
      <p>The midfield battle has been incredibly tight this season and the standings of the 5th, 6th and 7th place will go down to the final race. </p>
