      <p>A record number of women are set to stand in next month’s General Election.</p>
      <p>Provisional analysis by the PA news agency shows that 1,120 female candidates have registered – 34% of the total.</p>
      <p>This is the highest proportion of women candidates in a general election in history, up from 29% in 2017 and 26% in 2015.</p>
      <p>More than half of all Labour’s candidates are women – a first for a major political party in the UK.</p>

      <p>By contrast, about three in 10 of those standing for the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats are women.</p>
      <p>The overall number of candidates in December’s poll is currently 3,322.</p>
      <p>This is a very small increase on the 3,304 candidates in the 2017 general election.</p>
      <p>The total for 2019 could be revised slightly in the next few days, after the PA has completed its final verification of candidate data.</p>

      <p>Labour is fielding 631 candidates in this election (not including the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle), and 333 of these are women: 53%.</p>
      <p>This is a big jump from the 2017 election, when the equivalent figure for Labour was 42%.</p>
      <p>For the Conservatives, 190 of their 635 candidates at this election are women, making a total of 30%.</p>
      <p>This is a very small increase on 29% in 2017.</p>

      <p>Of the 611 Lib Dem candidates, 188 (31%) are women – up from 29% last time.</p>
      <p>Two of the smaller parties have higher levels of female representation at this election than both the Tories and the Lib Dems.</p>
      <p>The Greens have 498 candidates and 204 (41%) are women. For the SNP, 20 of its 59 candidates (34%) are women.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, exactly a quarter of Plaid Cymru’s candidates are women: nine out of 36.</p>
      <p>Female candidates comprise 54 of the Brexit Party’s total of 275, or 20%.</p>
