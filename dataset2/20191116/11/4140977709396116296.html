          <p>Lionel Messi was the centre of attraction in the game against Brazil, which was held in Saudi Arabia last night. From his <a href="https://thesportsrush.com/lionel-messi-overturns-defence-into-attack-and-humiliates-philippe-coutinho-in-process/">splendid skills</a> to his missed penalty, fans in the King Saud stadium loved his presence last night.</p>
          <p>Amidst all of this, Messi also ended up being in a controversy, as he allegedly told Brazil’s coach Tite when he was protesting against Argentine International and pleaded the referee to show him a yellow card.</p>

                            <p>Brazil captain Thiago Silva also slammed Messi after their defeat to Argentina in Saudi Arabia.</p>
                            <p>“He wanted to run the game, wanted to blow the whistle. He gave two balls to the ball and the referee did nothing. He argued with the referee and the referee kept laughing. Admiration has to be set aside,” he explained.</p>
                            <p>“It’s hard, because we talk so much about education and one of the most admired guys in football say… I’m not going to tell an old man because he’ll be mad at me, but have a coach shut up. As much as you have rivalry, education must come first.”</p>
                            <p>Messi’s goal in the initial minutes of the game made the Brazilians lose the match. The selecaos are without a win in the last 5 games.</p>
