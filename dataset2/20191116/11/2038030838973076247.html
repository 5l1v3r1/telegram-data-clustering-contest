      <p>Johannesburg – Halsey, Brendan Urie, Gigi Hadid and Ruby Rose are among a list of celebrities who have spoken out in support of Taylor Swift following her latest row with Scooter Braun.  </p>
      <p>This comes after Taylor claimed that a proposed Netflix documentary, and her performance at the upcoming American Music Awards where she will receive the Artist of the Decade award, might be in jeopardy because Scooter and Scott Borchetta will not allow her to use any of her old music. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/Music/News/unpacking-the-taylor-swift-and-scooter-braun-drama-this-is-how-things-got-here-20190702"><b>Taylor's feud with Scooter</b></a> began earlier this year when he bought her former record label Big Machine, giving him a majority stake in the masters of her first six albums. </p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/Music/News/according-to-taylor-swift-scooter-braun-wont-let-her-perform-her-own-songs-at-the-amas-or-in-her-new-netflix-doccie-20191115"><b>social media post</b></a>, Taylor claimed that Scooter and Scott told her team that she's "not allowed to perform my old songs on television because they claim that would be re-recording my music before I'm allowed to next year."</p>
      <p>On Friday Big Machine denied that allegation, saying in a statement: "Taylor, the narrative you have created does not exist."</p>
      <p>"At no point did we say Taylor could not perform on the AMAs or block her Netflix special," the statement continued, adding, "We do not have the right to keep her from performing live anywhere," reports AFP. </p>

      <p>While Brendan Urie addressed the drama during a live-stream, saying that reading Taylor's statement broke his heart, Halsey made her voice heard through a lengthy post on her Instagram stories.</p>
      <p>A close friend of Taylor's, model Gigi Hadid, shared a Twitter post, writing: "Scooter and Scott, you know what the right thing to do is."</p>
