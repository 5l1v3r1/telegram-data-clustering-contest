      <p>“The Queen is a fan,” a source told  <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/11/kate-middleton-the-queen-relatable">Vanity Fair.</a></p>
      <p>“Kate is unflappable. Her mantra is very like the Queen’s keep calm and carry on approach in life, and she has the added benefit of making the Royal Family seem almost normal and in touch.”</p>
