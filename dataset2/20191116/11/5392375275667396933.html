      <p>Although <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/apple">Apple</a> is one step behind in 5G, some institutions still believe that Apple will take the lead in 5G mobile phone shipments next year. According to the latest report from Strategy Analytics, although Apple has not yet launched a 5G iPhone, it may lead the 5G smartphone market in 2020. Strategy Analytics believes that after September 2020, Apple will only be able to compete in the 5G market simply by meeting its current upgrade speed.</p>

      <p>According to Ken Hyers, director of Strategy Analytics, “It seems that Apple without 5G mobile phones will be able to surpass Samsung and Huawei, the leaders of the current 5G market. This seems counterintuitive…But with the launch of three new 5G models next year, Apple only needs to match its current upgrade rate to the new iPhone model to take the lead next year.”</p>
      <p>Ville-Petteri Ukonaho, deputy director of Strategy Analytics, said: “At present, Samsung is the undisputed market leader in 5G smartphones…But with the two largest 5G markets in 2020, Huawei and Apple dominated China and in the United States, these two vendors will be in the leading position in the 5G field next year.”</p>
      <p>Earlier, a well-known Apple analyst, Guo Minghao, pointed out in the report that all 2020 iPhones will support 5G. Although Apple should get good results in the 5G smartphone market in 2020, Strategy Analytics ultimately believes that Samsung will become the long-term leader of 5G for its “dominant position in the entire smartphone market” and a wider range of prices. At the same time, Huawei’s success has some limits – the US trade ban. However, it will still lead China in 5G development.</p>
