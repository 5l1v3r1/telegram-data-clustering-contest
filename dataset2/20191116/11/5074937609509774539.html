      <h1>Volta Region to benefit from critical roads in 2020 budget - Finance Minister</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T11:48:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 11:48</time> by <a rel="author">Benjamin Mensah, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Accra, Nov. 15, GNA – Mr. Ken Ofori-Atta, the Finance Minister, has given an assurance that Volta Region is going to benefit from “critical roads” projects, in 2020.</p>
      <p>He told Parliament that the 45-kilometre (km) Asikuma-Have, 83km Have-Hohoe-Jasikan, and the 99 km Ho-Dzodze-Denu, would be tackled.</p>
      <p>He said the region’s “critical roads” project had been captured in the 2020 Budget.</p>
      <p>The Minister on Wednesday, November 13, presented the 2020 Budget Statement and Economic Policy of the Government to Parliament.</p>
      <p>Following the presentation, the Minister said his attention was drawn to an omission of the Region from the list of critical roads listed in ‘Table 21’ of the Budget Statement. </p>
      <p>The minority National Democratic Congress MPs from the Region, a day after the budget presentation, held a press conference to complain about the omission and demanded that this was corrected within 48 hours.</p>
      <p>Mr. Ofori-Atta said his checks confirmed the omission was inadvertent.</p>
      <p>“All the Regional Ministers were requested to submit a list of critical roads which required immediate attention.</p>
      <p>“At the instance of the Volta Regional Minister, three (3) road projects in the Volta Region were prioritised in the list of critical road projects for 2020, “the Finance Minister said.</p>
      <p>He added: “As it turned out on page 160 of the Budget document, the Volta Region was inadvertently left out.</p>
      <p>“In the event, I am here to amend Table 21 to include the critical roads in the Volta Region as originally agreed on.</p>
      <p>Mr. Ofori-Atta informed the House that some other important road projects in the region programmed for the coming year included dualisation of the Ho Main Roads, construction of the Ho bypass, replacement and expansion works on the Lower Volta Bridge at Sogakope, construction of a bridge over the Volta River at Volivo and the Dufor-Adidome-Asikuma Junction Road.</p>
      <p>The Ministry of Roads and Highways has already prioritised the Asutuare-Aveyime Road, upgrading of the Klefe Town Roads in the Ho Municipality, those of Akatsi Town, Ketu South Area and selected roads in the Kpando Municipality and Ketu North Area.</p>
