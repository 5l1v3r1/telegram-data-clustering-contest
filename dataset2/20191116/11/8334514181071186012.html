      <p>FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A federal judge on Saturday ordered that a German citizen arrested on her return to the country on suspicion of being a member of Islamic State should remain in custody, prosecutors said.</p>
      <p>Authorities said the suspect, identified only as Nasim A.,</p>
      <p>had left Germany for Syria in 2014, married a fighter and moved with him to Iraq. There she was paid to maintain an IS-controlled house and carried a weapon.</p>
      <p>She and her husband later moved to Syria, where she also maintained a house, prosecutors said. She was arrested in early 2019 by Kurdish security forces.</p>
      <p>The woman was arrested on Friday evening in Frankfurt upon her return to Germany.</p>
      <p>The judge determined on Saturday that she remain in detention because of “suspicion of being a member of a terrorist organization in a foreign country”, prosecutors said.</p>
