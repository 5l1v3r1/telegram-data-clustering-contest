      <p>Jeremy Corbyn has been joined by senior party figures to hammer out the final details of the Labour manifesto amid mounting divisions over what stance will be taken on immigration.</p>
      <p>The leader, his shadow cabinet, trade unions, affiliated organisations and the national policy forum are meeting to confirm the contents of the manifesto in central London.</p>
      <p>Immigration has re-emerged as a key General Election battleground and is expected be among the most heated discussions at Saturday’s clause V meeting.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn has previously committed to a “fair immigration process” which could include looking at whether freedom of movement will continue in the event of the UK leaving the EU.</p>
      <p>There are reports of a party split on the matter and Labour Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said on Saturday that immigration is a “difficult” issue as there are “still different perspectives” within Labour.</p>
      <p>“I think they’re right to be talking about a practical deal that keeps us as close to Europe as possible,” Mr Burnham told Sophy Ridge on Sky.</p>
      <p>Pressed on whether he thinks Labour should back a position where free movement of people ends after Brexit, Mr Burnham said: “I think the public voted for change in the way the immigration arrangements work with Europe.</p>

      <p>“To deny that, I think, would be to deny what many people were saying when they went to vote in 2016, and that’s just, in my view, a fact. It doesn’t help politicians, it doesn’t help Parliament, if they look like they’re kind of cocooned away from that public view.</p>
      <p>“I think what we shouldn’t do is introduce wholesale change. Just some greater management of the system.”</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn arrived at the meeting accompanied by shadow chancellor John McDonnell.</p>
      <p>Len McCluskey, leader of Unite the Union, arrived moments later and approached protesters chanting in support of free movement at the entrance.</p>
      <p>Mr McCluskey shouted over them: “I’m going to support free movement and I support migrant workers.”</p>
      <p>Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said “end racism” as she passed the protesters while shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: “We need to make sure we’ve got international staff – nurses and doctors who continue to work for the NHS.”</p>
      <p>The Daily Telegraph reported that Mr Corbyn faces a frontbench split, referring to claims that a draft version of Labour’s manifesto contains a commitment to freedom of movement.</p>
      <p>The newspaper quoted a shadow cabinet source as saying: “If we maintain a close relationship with the single market then we are going to have to maintain freedom of movement. That’s a given.”</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, The Independent reported that policies of extending free movement and giving foreign nationals the right to vote in all UK elections are expected to be watered down or scrapped.</p>
      <p>Asked about the reports, a spokeswoman for Labour said: “We didn’t provide any guidance for them ahead of the manifesto and won’t be for others.”So far Labour has announced a plan to create a publicly-owned broadband entity to deliver free full-fibre internet to the entire nation, as well as boosts to the minimum wage and the NHS.</p>
      <p>Full details of the manifesto are supposed to remain tightly-sealed until the formal unveiling on a date in future.</p>

      <p>In a promise that will delight some and dismay others, Mr Corbyn has pledged to deliver “the most radical and exciting plan for real change the British public has even seen”.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Lord Falconer has written to the Metropolitan Police Commissioner and Director of Public Prosecutions calling for a probe into claims the Tories offered peerages to senior Brexit Party figures in a bid to get them to stand aside.</p>
      <p>Scotland Yard said it has received two allegations of electoral fraud and malpractice in relation to the 2019 General Election which are currently being assessed.</p>
