      <p>Triumph has released a short teaser announcing that it will be revealing a new Tiger range on December 3.</p>
      <p>The bike shown in the video has a pair of spotlights and a new DRL that sits above the headlight. This confirms that the Tiger 900 will use the headlight that has been seen in international spy pictures. While not much else can be seen, the video does have text that reads "The new Tiger 900 Rally &amp; GT range. Adventure, transformed. 7pm GMT on Tuesday, December 3 (12:30am IST Wednesday)."</p>
      <p>The new Tiger 900 range will most certainly replace the current Tiger 800 models as the company's middleweight adventure bikes that sit below the Tiger 1200 variants in India and international markets.</p>
      <p>These Tiger 900 models are also expected to be using Euro 5 (BS6) compliant engines. We can also expect these bikes to be slightly more powerful than the Tiger 800 range (Rs 12 lakh-15.17 lakh) and come with an obvious hike in prices. However, it will be priced below the Tiger 1200, which is currently on sale in India at Rs 17 lakh.</p>
