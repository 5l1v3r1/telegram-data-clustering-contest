      <h1>'Another option' - These are West Brom's priorities in January transfer window</h1>
      <h2>Latest West Bromwich Albion transfer news | It's not long now until the January transfer window opens</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T11:37:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 11:37</time> by <a rel="author">Kieran Doody, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/kieran-doody/, Mark Wakefield</a></address>
      <p>The January transfer window may still be a couple of months away, but <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">West Bromwich Albion</a> are sure to have an eye on where they could <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/west-brom-liverpool-man-city-17242827">potentially strengthen their squad</a> .</p>
      <p>The Baggies are on course to achieve promotion to the Premier League, and currently lie at the top of the Sky Bet Championship table.</p>
      <p>Albion brought in nine new players during the summer transfer window – six permanent and three on loan – and also have a new manager at the helm with <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/grady-diangana-west-brom-bilic-17243837">Slaven Bilic</a> .</p>
      <p>But where might Albion’s priorities lie when the window reopens?</p>
      <p>We take a look at the business the Baggies might look to do in January.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>A striker is top of the list</h3>

      <p>Albion are really missing a striker who will chip in with goals more regularly.</p>
      <p>Charlie Austin, despite his efforts for the team, hasn't been as prolific as everyone was expecting when he signed in the summer.</p>
      <p>Hal Robson-Kanu and Kenneth Zohore can have an impact in certain situations but they're more impact players than regular starters.</p>
      <p>The obvious answer would be Dwight Gayle, every fan would like to see him back and a player of that ilk could be the missing piece that allows Albion to pull away from the chasing pack.</p>

      <h3>A back-up to Diangana</h3>

      <h3> </h3>
      <p>Filip Krovinovic and Matheus Pereira could play there in Grady Diangana's absence but we have seen this season they do not have quite the same impact, they both have a bigger influence on games in more central positions.</p>
      <p>Ideally Albion would want a back up for Diangana with Oliver Burke and Jonathan Leko out on loan.</p>
      <p>Despite Manuel Pellegrini insisting he wants Diangana to develop at West Brom, everyone at the club will still be worried after what happened with Harvey Barnes last season.</p>
      <p>There could be a new man in charge at West Ham by January with Pellegrini's job under threat and if Diangana was to be recalled this would be a priority.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>Defensive strength</h3>

      <h3> </h3>
      <p>If we're being really picky Albion might want another option at centre-back, Semi Ajayi and Kyle Bartley are playing well and Albion still have Ahmed Hegazi to come back but one or two injuries and Bilic will have to look to the youth players.</p>
      <p>Youngsters like Nathan Ferguson and Kyle Edwards have proven that Albion have quality in their youth ranks and Dara O'Shea could be the next to break through after impressing in pre-season but Bilic might want to opt for a bit more experience at the back.</p>
