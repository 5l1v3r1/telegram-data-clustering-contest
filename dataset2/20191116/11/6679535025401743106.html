      <h1>MTC terminus in West Saidapet needs a facelift</h1>
      <h2>Commuters seek rooms for lactating mothers</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T11:45:34+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 11:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/D-Madhavan-68/" target="_blank">D. Madhavan</a></address>
      <p>Seven years after it was set up by the Greater Chennai Corporation in 2012, the Metropolitan Transport Corporation terminus on West Jones Road in West Saidapet remains in a sorry state. The steel seats are broken the roof is leaky and the lights are not burning.</p>
      <p>The facility caters to residents of Bharathiyar Nagar, LIC Colony, Kamatchi Nagar, Jayaram Colony, and Jafferkhanpet.</p>
      <p>“During monsoon, rainwater remains stagnant within the terminus as the stormwater drain is clogged,” says S. Chakarapani, a resident of West Saidapet. Commuters also complain about absence of rest-rooms and a room for lactating mothers</p>
      <p>At present, only two MTC services — 18K (From West Saidapet to Broadway) and 45B (From West Saidapet to Anna Square) are operated from this terminus. Also, a small bus is operated from this terminus to CMBT in Koyambedu. Commuters also suggested that small bus services connecting T. Nagar and Saidapet terminuses should be provided.</p>
      <p>“Steps will be taken to give a facelift to the terminus soon,” says a MTC official.</p>
