      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kriti-Sanon">Kriti Sanon</a> playing a young surrogate mother onscreen for the first time has already heightened the excitement of the audience. The actress who has done light-hearted roles so far will be for the first time be seen doing some serious portrayal with Dinesh Vijain's 'Mimi'.</p>
      <p>Recently, there was a buzz that the makers have started the first schedule of the film in <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Churu">Churu</a>, Rajasthan, a few days ago, however, the shoot was stalled by the local police as permission was not taken to shoot the film in the city. Today, we got some BTS pictures of Kriti as she shoots for the film. The 'Luka Chuppi' actress was snapped on the sets in her look. Kriti was seen in a burkha while in the other pictures, she can be seen in a de-glam avatar. She is wearing a worn-out cotton Punjabi suit which gives a glimpse of her character in the film. With kohled eyes and messy hair, Kriti gives justice to the character.</p>
