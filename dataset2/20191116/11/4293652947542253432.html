      <h1>Grizzlies’ Dillon Brooks on playing for Canada: ‘I plan on being there’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T11:42:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 11:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/author/sportsnet-staff/" target="_blank">Sportsnet Staff</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/players/dillon-brooks/854601">Dillon Brooks</a> — a Mississauga, Ont., native — has enjoyed a stellar start to his third NBA season with the <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/teams/memphis-grizzlies/">Memphis Grizzlies</a>.</p>
      <p>This summer, he hopes to translate that success to the international stage with Canada’s men’s basketball team at the Olympic qualifying tournament in Victoria.</p>
      <p>“I plan on being there, I plan on playing regardless of if I get a contract or whatever happens,” Brooks recently told <a href="https://ca.nba.com/news/after-a-year-full-of-injury-memphis-grizzlies-forward-dillon-brooks-is-ready-to-establish-himself-as-a-household-name-in-the-nba/17mbjg2suyu6h1ibcukvkbie0k">NBA.com</a>.</p>
      <p>“I’m going to play for Team Canada because, you know, I missed out this year and I really want to play and make it to the Olympics.</p>
      <p>“It’s something in my basketball career that I want to do — wear that red and white. It’s going to be a special year for us in Canada.”</p>
      <p>On Friday, Canada received the news that it was selected to host an OQT from June 23-28, 2020 in Victoria, B.C. Canada, the No. 21 men’s team in the world in <a href="https://www.fiba.basketball/rankingmen">FIBA’s rankings</a>, will have to win the six-team event (the other countries have not yet been announced) to advance to the 2020 Olympic Summer Games in Tokyo.</p>
      <p>Canada’s men’s team hasn’t qualified for the Olympics since 2000. The country hasn’t medaled since earning silver in the inaugural Berlin Olympic Games in 1936.</p>
      <p>Brooks, who is averaging 14.2 points, 2.2 assists and 3.7 blocks through 12 games this season, would be a welcomed addition to a group that lacked star power during September’s 2019 FIBA World Cup in China. Canada finished 21st in the 32-team pool, with only two NBA players (Corey Joseph and Khem Bhirch) on the roster.</p>
      <p>In his conversation with NBA.com, Brooks acknowledged that he declined Team Canada’s World Cup invite to focus on making off-season improvements to his game. Brooks missed all but 18 games of the 2018-19 NBA season due to a sprained MCL and a ruptured ligament in his big toe.</p>
      <p>Still, he’s a major supporter of Canadian basketball. Brooks follows the successes of fellow countrymen and uses it as motivation.</p>
      <p>“It’s always like in college, AAU and in the NBA, you always look out for your Canadians to see how they’re doing,” he said. “It’s kind of like a competitive thing as well. You see someone go off for 20 you say, ‘Oh I want to get 20.’</p>
      <p>“It helps the culture build up into a better basketball country.”</p>
      <p>If Brooks has it his way, he’ll be part of the group that helps further grow that culture this summer in Victoria — with a trip to Tokyo on the line.</p>
