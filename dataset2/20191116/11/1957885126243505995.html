      <p>2K has apologised after a social media hack of its various accounts was used to post racist comments.</p>
      <p>Yesterday evening, 2K lost control of a raft of its social media accounts across Twitter and Facebook, including the official pages for Borderlands, WWE and Civilization.</p>
      <p>During the hack, the official accounts were used to post a number of offensive messages. The Facebook page for WWE 2K saw its profile picture changed to the logo for AEW Wrestling, and its cover image changed to a picture of wrestler Chris Benoit.</p>

      <p>During the hack, the official WWE 2K page issued a message attributed to someone calling themselves "Nublom": "there's an employee out here refreshing and removing/updating the pic every time and he can't do anything to stop it, let that sink in ladies and gentlemen."</p>
      <p>2K has now regained control over its social media, and issued an apology:</p>
      <p>"Social media accounts across the 2K label were compromised early Friday evening. Unfortunately, offensive material was posted that does not reflect the values of 2K or our partners. We condemn these posts and apologise to everyone offended by the content."</p>
      <p>The 2K social media hack comes hot on the heels of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-08-ea-fifa-staff-personal-twitter-accounts-hacked-as-harassment-gets-even-uglier">a hack of a number of EA Sports FIFA staff members</a>, which followed a ban given to a high-profile former FIFA pro player.</p>
