      <p>Taking to Instagram, <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/4910618/love-island-laura-anderson-red-lingerie/">the star</a> wrote: "Strike me a pose 📸 #loveourbodies</p>
      <p>"Never let anyone tell you to fasten up those jeans because PASTA IS LIFE."</p>
      <p>And fans couldn't get enough - with some hailing Laura as "stunning".</p>
      <p>One fan said: "Drop dead gorgeous."</p>

      <p>While another wrote: "No other words but stunning."</p>
      <p>And fellow Love Islander Anna Vakili said: "Ahhh you are fireeee."</p>
      <p>Towie star Courtney Green added: "Sexy."</p>
      <p>It came after the former Love Islander put out an <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/4957214/laura-anderson-rangers-celtic-betfred-cup/">appeal for tickets</a> to the Betfred Cup clash between Celtic and Rangers at Hampden next month.</p>
      <p>Taking to social media, Laura said: "I'm back in Glasgow start of December, it's a long shot but can anyone help me out with a ticket for the cup final?</p>
      <p>"For the good end obviously. Because I'm Simply The Best".</p>
      <p>We previously told how earlier this month <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/4908850/laura-anderson-love-island-breast-surgery/">the star revealed</a> she wished she'd never had a boob job.</p>
      <p>Opening up on Instagram, Laura warned fans about the horror "consequences" of having plastic surgery - as she revealed her breast reduction scars.</p>
      <p>And last month, the star <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/4804720/laura-anderson-love-island-dubai-home-pink-swimsuit/">flaunted her curves</a> in a pink swimsuit in her "second home" Dubai.</p>
