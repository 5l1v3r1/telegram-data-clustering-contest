      <p>Fortune recently had the chance to interview Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser. Mr. Bowser was asked about the recently released <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/?s=Switch+Lite">Switch Lite</a> platform and what Nintendo’s goal was with the platform given that consumers can purchase the original Nintendo Switch. Mr. Bowser said the end goal is to diversify and to reach out to a larger audience that may not think about purchasing a home console.</p>
      <blockquote>“We’re seeing a higher percent of female consumers buying Nintendo Switch Lite than buy the flagship,” Nintendo of America President Doug Bowser says. “We see Lite as a great opportunity for us to expand with that audience.”<br/><br/>“Our intent with Nintendo Switch Lite is absolutely to reach a more expanded audience and to do so by offering a more dedicated gaming device for those that were really looking for that experience,”</blockquote>
