      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/turkey">Turkey </a>will use the S-400 missile defence system it has bought from Russia despite the US threat of sanctions, a senior defence official said Saturday.</p>
      <p>The purchase of the Russian system and its subsequent delivery of the system in July has been a major source of friction between two NATO allies <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/turkey">Turkey </a>and the United States.</p>
      <p>Last month the US said <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/turkey">Turkey </a>would be spared sanctions under a 2017 law if the S-400 system is not turned on.</p>
      <p>"It is not a correct approach to say 'we will not use for someone else's sake' a system we had purchased out of our need and we paid that amount of money," Ismail Demir, the head of the Defence Industry Directorate, a government body, told private CNN Turk broadcaster.</p>
      <p>"We will do our duty and (the system) will become usable. How it will be used is a decision to be made later," he said.</p>
      <p>"We should respect the agreement we signed and that's what suits us as a country." The issue was raised in talks in Washington this week between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his US counterpart Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>Trump said afterwards that Turkey's controversial acquisition created "serious challenges" for Washington as he added officials would "immediately" get to work on resolving the issue.</p>
      <p>Turkey was removed from the F-35 fighter jet programme as a consequence of the purchase.</p>
      <p>Erdogan's spokesman Ibrahim Kalin on Friday said: "There is no question of a step backwards, Turkey will activate the S-400.</p>
