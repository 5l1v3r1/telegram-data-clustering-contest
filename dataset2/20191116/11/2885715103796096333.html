      <p>As the Bangalore Turf Club’s winter season began Friday, three jockeys suffered a bad fall which led to a protest by punters at the event.</p>
      <p>In the 1200m November Plate, which began at 2.15 pm on Friday, jockey Suraj Narredu astride Will To Win, the second favorite, looked set to win but fell down when the horse lost her footing in the final furlong and broke her leg.</p>
      <p>Kiran Rai piloting Sir Piggot escaped unhurt while Srinath, who was guiding the public choice Aceros, sustained a hip injury. The Will to Win was later put to sleep on humanitarian grounds.</p>
