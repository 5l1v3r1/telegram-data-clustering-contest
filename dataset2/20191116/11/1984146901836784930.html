      <h1>City centre grocer Mmm and Glug closes suddenly blaming 'crippling' tax and Christmas market</h1>
      <h2>Mmm...and Glug has been selling beer, wine and luxury ingredients in Newcastle since 2008</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T11:40:49+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 11:40</time> by <a rel="author">Hannah Graham</a></address>
      <p>A popular artisan food and drink store has blamed 'crippling' tax and falling footfall for a sudden pre-Christmas closure.</p>
      <p>Mmm...and Glug has been selling high end drinks and ingredients in Newcastle since 2008, moving in 2017 from the Grainger Market to a shop on Grainger Street.</p>
      <p>But now owners Simone and Ian Clarkin say "the numbers simply don't add up" as high business rates combine with threats to footfall, including the city's Christmas market and the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/clean-air-zone-final-consultation-17071242">clean air toll which is set to hit the city</a> .</p>
      <p>Under current plans, a toll-zone will enforce fees on high-polluting coaches, buses, and lorries. Private cars are not yet set to be affected by the scheme, but that could change.</p>
      <p>The pair also said they had had issues with an "inflexible" landlord.</p>

      <p>In a statement posted on Twitter on Saturday, the owners said: "Due to the inflexibility of our overseas-based landlord and the UK's crippling business rates we have reluctantly decided to close mmm....and glug.</p>
      <p>"It was costing us around Â£100,000 a year simply to open our doors - before we bought any stock to sell, paid our employees, plus other costs, such as insurance and energy.</p>
      <p>"That, along with falling city centre footfall, possible future congestion charges and a massively expanded Christmas Market, means that the numbers now simply don't add up.</p>
      <p>"We have spent 12 hard (but oh so enjoyable) years bringing great ingredients, food and drink to the region.</p>
      <p>"Without our wonderful customers, amazing producers and hard-working employees none of that would be possible - and we are sorry to let you all down with our decision.</p>
      <p>"We hope to be back in the future. Until then, can we once again thank you for your wonderful support."</p>
