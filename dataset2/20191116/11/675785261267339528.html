      <p>Manchester United have struggled for goals so far this season - but they look set to have no shortage of firepower if they get their way in the transfer window.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils are weighing up a stunning £200million swoop of wonderkids Jadon Sancho and Erling-Braut Haaland to bolster Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's options.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old duo are amongst Europe's hottest prospects with the prolific Haaland starring for Red Bull Salzburg and Sancho potentially available after a tough start to the season with Borussia Dortmund.</p>
      <p>Both players top United's list of priority targets as they look to splash the cash in January after a tough start to the season.</p>
      <p>Here's how United could line-up if they get deals for Sancho and Haaland over the line to solve their goalscoring problems.</p>
