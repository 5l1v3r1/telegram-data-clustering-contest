      <p>U.S. President Donald Trump cleared three army officers who had been accused of war crimes in high-profile cases, pardoning two and restoring the rank of another.</p>
      <p>The move on Friday came in spite of reported objection to the president’s plan within the Pentagon and military, but amid prodding by conservatives, including lawmakers staunchly allied with Trump.</p>
      <p>The president has previously voiced support for the soldiers, including on Twitter.</p>
      <p>The three cases of Clint Lorance, Mathew Golsteyn and Edward Gallagher are unrelated.</p>
      <p>Two took place in Afghanistan and one in Iraq.</p>
      <p>Gallagher was found not-guilty of murder this year, but was convicted of a lesser charge and was demoted.</p>
      <p>Trump now restored his previous rank.</p>
      <p>Golsteyn is awaiting trial for murder while Lorance is currently serving a 19-year jail sentence for two murders.</p>
      <p>Both were granted full pardons.</p>
      <p>The New York Times had reported that top officials, including Defense Secretary Mark Esper, were opposed to clearing the soldiers, saying it would undermine justice and serve as a bad example.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Trump pardoned an army officer who had already served his prison term and was released on parole, following a guilty verdict for a murder in Iraq.</p>
      <p>“The President, as Commander-in-Chief, is ultimately responsible for ensuring that the law is enforced and when appropriate, that mercy is granted,” the White House said in a statement. (dpa/NAN)</p>
