      <h1>'Good luck' - Manchester United sent emphatic transfer message by Aston Villa fans</h1>
      <h2>Aston Villa transfer news | Jack Grealish and John McGinn have been linked with a move to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side in January when the transfer window re-opens</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T11:12:30+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 11:12</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Cusack</a></address>
      <p>Aston Villa fans have been reacting to transfer speculation linking Jack Grealish and John McGinn with Manchester United.</p>
      <p>According to ESPN, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/manchester-united-transfer-news-grealish-17267345">the Villa pair are on a transfer hit-list alongside six other players</a> Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side want to sign to beef up their squad in January.</p>
      <p>United feel they need to replace Alexis Sanchez and Romelu Lukaku, who left for Inter Milan in the summer and Ander Herrera who joined paris Saint-Germain on a free transfer.</p>
      <p>Grealish and McGinn are key components of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=dean+smith+birmingham+live">Dean Smith</a> 's side, the duo impressing last season as Villa clinched promotion back to the Premier League.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>And they have seven League goals between them this season and are first-choice midfielders.</p>
      <p>Understandably, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> fans are defiant on social media.</p>
      <p>
