      <p>Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic has been hospitalised with "cardiovascular problems", his office said Saturday.</p>
      <p>"The President Aleksandar Vucic was accepted in the military hospital in Belgrade on November 15 late afternoon," his office said in a short statement.</p>
      <p>It gave no further details about the president's health or current condition.</p>
      <p>It was first time it has been officially disclosed that Vucic, 49, has heart problems.</p>
      <p>Contacted by AFP, his media advisor was not immediately available for comment. </p>
      <p>Vucic, an ultra-nationalist turned pro-European, was elected president in 2017, but has been a powerful figure in the country's politics since 2012 when his Serbian Progressive Party won elections.</p>
      <p>He was prime minister from 2014 to 2017.</p>
      <p>According to the Serbian constitution, the post of president is largely ceremonial, but Vucic is a key decision maker for most issues in the country.</p>
