      <h1>Kitchener looking for feedback on first draft of Cycling and Trails Master Plan</h1>
      <h2>An online survey is available until November 30</h2>

      <p>The City of Kitchener is hoping to better connect Kitchener through walking and cycling trails. </p>
      <p>In their first round of engagement, they spoke with 2000 residents about what they would like to see in the master plan. </p>
      <p>They developed a draft of the master plan from the suggestions they received from the public. </p>
      <p>Barry Cronkite, Director of Transportation Services with the City of Kitchener explained what the draft entails.</p>
      <p>"We have come up with a vision, a mission, goals, and strategies. We have also come up with what our proposed network infrastructure should look like and what those spines are."</p>
      <p>He said they are on to the second phase of engagement which is an online survey to gather feedback about the draft. </p>
      <p>"We are essentially asking people what they think of the plan to date, the vision, the mission, the goals, what they think of the network and essentially if we have missed anything. There is an opportunity to fill in any gaps that we have missed at this point."</p>
      <p>Cronkite said they will be taking the feedback into consideration when creating the final plan which they are planning to take to council in April of 2020. </p>
      <p>"If it's approved at that time you will start to see, hopefully, some pretty substantial changes in the construction season of 2020."</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.engagewr.ca/cycling-and-trails-master-plan">online survey</a> is available until November 30. <br/> </p>
