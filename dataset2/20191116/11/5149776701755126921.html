      <h1>Railway worker put job at risk after refusing a roadside breath test</h1>
      <h2>He had a drink while waiting for a pizza</h2>

      <p>Railway worker Russell Comery had a drink while waiting for a pizza - and put his job at risk.</p>
      <p>He refused to give a breath test after he picked up the takeaway to eat at his mother's home, a court heard.</p>
      <p>And that added up to a three-year driving ban for Comery, who appeared at Nottingham Magistrates' Court on his 57th birthday.</p>
      <p>District Judge Tim Spruce told him: "You might not have been over the legal limit."</p>
      <p>But he pointed out that Comery had four previous offences related to drink driving. The disqualification will be cut by a quarter if he completes a course on the perils of using a car after downing alcohol.</p>
      <p>Stephen Burdon, mitigating, said that he had explained to Comery that it was an offence to refuse a breath test, even if he was satisfied he was not over the limit.</p>
      <p>Comery has no fixed address and lives in hotels because he travels the UK erecting fences beside railways.</p>
      <p>Mr Burdon told the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/courts">court</a>: "He had one drink whilst waiting for a pizza. He feels very frustrated.</p>
      <p>"He uses his vehicle to perform his role as a fencer on the railways. He is due to start in Carlisle on Monday and doesn't know how he will get there. He may lose the contract."</p>
      <p>Comery pleaded guilty to failing to give a sample when suspected of driving in Underwood on September 16. He was fined £300 with £117 costs.</p>
