      <p>Accra, Nov. 15, GNA - Mark Sarpong Agyei, a businessman who allegedly defrauded a Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and his clients of GH¢300,000.00 under the pretext of providing the clients’ jobs in various institutions but failed, has appeared before an Accra Circuit Court.</p>
      <p>Agyei charged with defrauding with false pretences has pleaded not guilty.</p>
      <p>The Court presided over by Mrs Jane Harriet Akweley Quaye has admitted Agyei to bail in the sum of GH¢300,000.00 with three sureties who are in gainful employment.</p>
      <p>He is to reappear on December 13.</p>
      <p>Prosecuting Inspector Isaac Anquandah narrated that the complainant James K. Ahinasi is the CEO of Med Recruit Ghana and a resident of Wetland, Accra. Agyei is also the CEO of Explorer International.</p>
      <p>Inspector Anquandah said in the early part of this year, Agyei approached the complainant’s company with a proposal that he had vacancies at various companies and institutions and that he would need the partnership of the complainant’s company to get interested applicants for the job openings at ECOBANK, Newmont, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, COCOBOD among others.</p>
      <p>Prosecution said in view of that, a witness Leonora Agyei, who is also a staff of the complainant’s company after a background check of the accused’s company began recruiting some interested applicants.</p>
      <p>Prosecution said applicants were made to pay various amounts ranging from GH¢500.00 to GH¢2,000.00 through Leonora Agyei to the accused person to the tune of GH¢300,000.00.</p>
      <p>Chief Inspector Anquandah said when the accused person was confronted over the exact day of employment, he began giving excuses and later went into hiding.</p>
      <p>Prosecution said a report was made to the Police and the accused person was picked up at Dansoman.</p>
      <p>During investigations, the prosecutor said Agyei admitted collecting the money from the complainant.</p>
