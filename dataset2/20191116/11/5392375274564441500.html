      <p>Huawei patents Razr-type verticial foldable phone<br/>4.5 (90%) 2 votes</p>
      <p>Lenovo owned Motorola a few hours ago unveiled its first foldable phone – the refreshed Motorola Razr that’s dripping in nostalgia. The form factor is unlike that of the Galaxy Fold or the Huawei Mate X. It is one that is liked by all, and it appears we would be seeing more of that in the coming months.</p>
      <p>Following the <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/14/the-foldable-motorola-razr-with-6-2-inch-oled-219-cinemavision-display-is-official/">release of the Razr</a>, a <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/15/xiaomi-patents-another-flip-type-foldable-phone/">Xiaomi patent</a> was spotted showing off similar tech, and now we have a <a href="https://techieword.com/huawei-patent-suggests-vertically-folding-phone-is-on-the-way/">fresh patent</a> design by Huawei that envisages a similar Razr foldable phone design.</p>

      <p>The approval granted by WIPO, and filed by HUAWEI TECHNOLOGIES CO. LTD and published in the Hague Bulletin no. 46/2019 reveals a foldable design that flips open in a vertical manner. The design has something in common with the Razr foldable phone – it folds from a conventional phone pattern to a more compact, and pocketable form. But unlike the Razr, it gets a single foldable display, with no external display. However, a small portion of the display remains exposed even when completely folded. That, perhaps, serves as the external display for viewing and performing quick functions.</p>

      <p>The design reveals a triple camera on the back panel with a dual-LED flash, while there are no evidence of any camera sensor on the flexible display. The design also reveals the buttons are located on the right side, other than that, there isn’t anything we can glean from the design.</p>
      <p>Do note that it is not certain the design will see the daylight since not all patent filings equate to an actual product. Huawei’s first foldable Mate X only became available for sale hours ago and is at the moment exclusive to China, and has yet to detail its international rollout plans.</p>
