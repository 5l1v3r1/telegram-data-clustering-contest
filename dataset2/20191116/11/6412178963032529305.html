        <b>Celtic are set to offer Jonny Hayes a new deal, but a number of clubs are looking to entice him away from the Scottish champions, we can reveal.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Cardiff City have been long-term admirers of the winger – who has become a big part of Neil Lennon’s first-team squad in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>Lennon is keen to offer Hayes – who is out of contract at the end of the season – a new deal but the 32-year-old is considering his options.</p>
      <p>Burnley, Huddersfield and Stoke are also understood to be considering offering the player a pre-contract in January.</p>
      <p>Hayes has scored twice in 39 league appearances for the <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/tag/celtic"><b>Bhoys</b></a> since joining from Aberdeen in a £1million deal in 2017, while he also won four caps for the Republic of Ireland.</p>
