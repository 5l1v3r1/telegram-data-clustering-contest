      <h1>Mark Taylor reviews 'one of the best restaurants for genuine Italian cooking'</h1>
      <h2>It has been 10 years since Rosemarino opened, but does it still deliver since their new partnership?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T11:26:49+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 11:26</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Taylor</a></address>
      <p>Apart from a new green frontage replacing the original duck egg blue colour scheme, the changes at Rosemarino have been subtle since the original owners joined forces with new business partners Hyde &amp; Co over the summer.</p>
      <p>Although founders Sam Fryer and Mirco Bertoldi are still heavily involved in Rosemarino ten years since it opened, the partnership with Hyde &amp; Co (the award-winning team behind The Ox, Seven Lucky Gods, Pata Negra, Bambalan, Milk Thistle and Hyde &amp; Co) is more about background support than making any significant changes to the restaurant or its menu.</p>
      <p>There has been a gentle refurbishment over the summer but I doubt even the most eagle-eyed regulars will spot too many differences.</p>
      <p>On the stormiest of evenings, the low lighting and flickering church candles of the dining room provided a warm and welcoming glow as I arrived cold and soaked to the skin - my jeans were still wet when I left over an hour later.</p>
      <p>There had been a few last minute cancellations due to the weather but most tables were occupied by 7.30pm - a combination of bookings and people simply walking in out of the rain for an impromptu supper.</p>
      <p>Many of the diners appeared to be tourists staying in nearby hotels but the table next to me was taken by a trio of young women discussing the finer details of a forthcoming wedding - over the course of my meal, I learnt more about lace overlays and fishtail dresses than I thought possible.</p>

      <p>There has been no significant change in the kitchen since I last visited Rosemarino around 14 months ago.</p>
      <p>Emilio Allegretti hails from Modena, Emilia-Romagna - famous for its balsamic vinegar - and before arriving at Rosemarino, he worked locally at Jamie’s Italian, Pinkman’s Bakery and Spoke and Stringer.</p>
      <p>A large part of Allegretti’s menu is made up of ‘cicchetti’ - Italian small plates that can be enjoyed tapas-style as snacks but which are also substantial enough to be a starter. These include leek and Taleggio arancini; breaded fried artichoke hearts with salsa verde, and a salad of tuna, pickled fennel, celery, carrot, cucumber and parsley salad.</p>
      <p>I began with the polenta condita (£7) - baked polenta layered with slow-cooked beef ragu and Parmesan.</p>
      <h3>'It was a strong start to the meal'</h3>
      <p>It looked like a toasted sandwich with its neat slices of crisp, crunchy polenta and melting Parmesan. The layers of rich and meaty ragu had the gentlest kiss of rosemary running through it but it also had a lightness to it. It was a strong start to the meal.</p>
      <p>Alongside the cicchetti, there are pasta dishes (the wild mushroom and truffle risotto, and the tagliatelle with home-smoked salmon, courgette, ricotta, lemon, dill and pistachio crumb seemed to be the most popular options judging from the number of them being delivered to other tables) and sharing plates of antipasti - cured meats, fish and vegetarian versions.</p>
      <p>I went for a main course of pan-fried hake fillet, fregola, mussels, fennel and orange salad (£17) - one of two specials on the board, the other being a classic porchetta.</p>

      <p>The fish was cooked with care and precision, its thick white flakes falling apart on contact. The fregola - a Sardinian pasta that looks like giant couscous - had taken on the flavours of the gently spiced sauce and the saltiness of the plump mussels. Shaved ribbons of fennel and pieces of orange brought an aniseed crunch and zesty freshness to the dish.</p>
      <p>From a dessert list which includes homemade tiramisu and a white chocolate pannacotta with dark chocolate mousse, raspberries and hazelnut praline, I went for the torta di mascarpone (£6).</p>
      <p>A slice of seriously rich mascarpone cheesecake on a layer of green-hued pistachio crumbs, it was topped with roasted figs, vanilla ice cream and a generous drizzle of honey.</p>

      <h3>THE VERDICT:</h3>
      <p>It was good to be back at Rosemarino and reassuring that nothing has essentially changed since the summer partnership. It’s the sort of charming neighbourhood restaurant we need more of and still one of the best places in Bristol for genuine Italian cooking and seamless service.</p>
      <h3>RATINGS:</h3>
      <p>Overall: 4</p>
      <p>Food: 4</p>
      <p>Service: 4</p>
      <p>Ambience: 4</p>
      <p>Value: 4</p>
      <p>Rosemarino, 1 York Place, Clifton, Bristol, BS8 1AH. Tel: 01179 736677.</p>
