      <p>In the past couple of years, the smartphone makers have been seeking new niches. Some of them have been investing in gaming products. Xiaomi was one of them. And though it has not launched a gaming smartphone itself, this company invested a lot in Black Shark. As a result, the latter designed a few gaming devices with an astonishing performance. Due to the <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/03/18/black-shark-2-is-official-gets-digital-signal-processor-sd-855-and-more/">powerful hardware</a> and deep system optimization, these smartphones were on the top of AnTuTu lists. Well, we already understood that products from this category are quite powerful. But what about other features? Camera? Today, <a href="https://www.dxomark.com/black-shark-2-camera-review/">DxOMark announced</a> the Black Shark 2 camera score. It turns out one of the best gaming handsets is even good in terms of photography. Our protagonist scores 84 points. Moreover, the video part performed slightly better, getting 85 points.</p>

      <p>DxOMark said that the Black Shark 2 is mainly designed for gamers. It comes with a large screen and a design full of future technology. So before testing, the camera performance has been considered to be secondary. However, the dual camera setting with optical zoom and bokeh mode still makes the Black Shark 2 have some good camera functions. In a suitable outdoor environment, it is possible to take exposure, color and zoom effects. The imaging performance is amazing.</p>
      <p>If talking about its pros and cons, the reviewing company said that photography is better. The outdoor target is well exposed; the outdoor color is pleasing to the eye; the flash has good exposure; the spot light shape is perfect and contrast. However, DxOMark also mentioned that there is still room for improvement in outdoor autofocus, night shooting, and bokeh mode when taking pictures.</p>
