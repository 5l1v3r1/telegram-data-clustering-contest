      <h3>Eagles overpower Tigers, zero in on crown.</h3>
      <p>ATENEO hardly missed a beat even with the long lay-off before the Finals.</p>
      <p>Thirdy Ravena sizzled with 32 points as the Blue Eagles outplayed University of Santo Tomas, 91-77, to move on the cusp of completing a perfect season in the UAAP men's basketball tournament last night before 19,176 fans at the Smart Araneta Coliseum.</p>
      <p>Unbeaten in 15 matches, Ateneo showed no signs of rust after a long 16-day break, leading by as much as 23 points to seize a 1-0 series lead.</p>
      <p>"I'm a big believer in preparation," said Eagles coach Tab Baldwin.</p>
      <p>Ateneo hopes to become the first team in history to go 16-0 in the season with another victory in Game 2 slated at 4 p.m. on Wednesday at the Mall of Asia Arena.</p>
      <p>Aware that the Growling Tigers will not just roll over and die after hurdling three step-ladder semifinal  matches, the Blue Eagles need to elevate their performance several notches higher to achieve their ultimate goal.</p>
      <p>"This is a must-win game for us. We know we are in for another tough game on Wednesday," said Baldwin.</p>
      <p>"Teams that Aldin coaches they never quit, they never back down," he added.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, UST's women's team followed the men's squad in the Finals as the Tigresses eliminated Far Eastern University, 76-65, in the step-ladder semifinals.</p>
      <p>Making its first championship appearance since a Peque Tan-mentored squad won it all in 2006, UST will face six-peat National University in the best-of-three series at 12 noon on Wednesday.  </p>
      <p>Ivorian Ange Kouame had a double-double effort of 18 points and 12 rebounds while SJ Belangel scored all of his 12 points from beyond the arc for Ateneo, which never trailed in the 40-minute clash</p>
      <p>The Eagles closed out the first half with 13-1 run with Belangel nailing three triples after the Tigers were able to move closer to within 38-41 behind rookie spitfire Mark Nonoy.</p>
      <p>Ateneo ran out of the gates strongly and posted its biggest lead of the first half, 36-17 lead after  Ravena scored on transition at the 7:49 mark of the second period.</p>
      <p>"We played bad, we played really bad," said UST coach Aldin Ayo.</p>
      <p>Nonoy was the only Tiger who came to play with 26 points in his first Finals game.</p>
      <p>"Mark Nonoy’s obviously a problem. He played a tremendous game. That’s very courageous. I got a lot of respect for that," said Baldwin.</p>
      <p>Grace Irebu, a two-time season MVP winner, powered the second-ranked Tigresses with 28 points, 14 rebounds, and three blocks, while Lon Rivero chipped in 13 points and five boards.</p>
      <p>"We waited for three years for this to happen," said UST coach Haydee Ong.</p>
      <p>The Tigresses last ruled the tournament in 2006 behind Marichu Bacaro and Rem Buenacosa under coach Peque Tan.</p>
      <p>Despite squandering a 22-point first half lead, Congolese Irebu would not be denied.</p>
      <p>"This game was very important for us," said Irebu.  </p>
