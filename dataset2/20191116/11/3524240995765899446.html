      <p>Former President Goodluck Jonathan has expressed disappointment over the late arrival of election materials to his Polling Unit 39, Ward 13, in Otuoke, Ogbia Local Government Area (LGA) of Bayelsa State.</p>
      <p>Jonathan, who expected to cast his vote, stepped out of his house at 8.30 a.m. but met only journalists as the Independent National Electoral Commission officials were yet to arrive at the venue.</p>
      <p>“Are you an electoral officer, where are they?” The former president asked a journalist at the venue.</p>
      <p>“Well this is where I will vote, but since they are not here yet, let me go back inside.</p>
      <p>“You see now, youths of nowadays, you need to do more,” he stated.</p>
      <p>The <i>News Agency of Nigeria</i> reports that as of the time of filing this report at 10.30 a.m, no official had arrived at the polling unit with materials for the exercise.</p>
