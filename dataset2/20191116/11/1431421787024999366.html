      <p>One person was killed in the Iranian city of Sirjan during protests that erupted after President Hassan Rohani's government imposed gasoline rationing and price hikes of at least 50 percent, Iranian ISNA news agency reported on Saturday.</p>
      <p>"One person was killed in Sirjan but ... we are investigating whether he was killed by the security forces who were trying to bring back calm to the city," ISNA quoted local official Mohammad Mahmoudabadi as saying.</p>
      <p>"The situation is calm in the city and everything is under control since last night."</p>
      <p>Also on Saturday, <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/iraq">Iraq</a> closed its southern Shalamcheh border crossing with <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/iran">Iran</a> to travelers from both countries, an Iraqi security source and an Iranian diplomat said.</p>
      <p>The security source said Tehran had demanded the closure because of <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/iraq/five-iraqi-protesters-killed-amid-violence-in-baghdad-squares-1.8131858">ongoing public protests</a> in both Iran and Iraq. The border would remain shut until further notice but would not affect goods or trade, the security source and the diplomat said</p>
