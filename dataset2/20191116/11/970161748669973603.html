      <p>A <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/brexit/">Brexit</a> Party candidate standing in the general election lives in Australia, a fair distance away from his would-be constituents.</p>
      <p>But Ed Punchard has pledged to buy a home in Tynemouth should he be elected next month.</p>
      <p>The 62-year-old, who grew up in North Wales, said he was willing to leave Fremantle, near Perth, after 30 years living Down Under where he has built a successful documentary-making business.</p>
      <p>Mr Punchard said he felt ‘a great fondness for’ the Tyneside constituency because it is on the North Sea.</p>
      <p>The former diver survived the terrible Piper Alpha oil rig disaster which claimed 167 workers’ lives in 1988.</p>

      <p>He added that he has family links to the fishing industry in south-west England and felt at home in Tynemouth.</p>
      <p>The parliamentary hopeful <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/brexit-party-candidate-tynemouth-australia-17256578">told ChronicleLive:</a> ‘The people of Tyneside are dedicated and decent people and they are fed up to the back teeth of Parliament.</p>
      <p>‘Both of the major political parties have shown they are either unwilling or unable to follow through with the people’s decision to leave the European Union, so how can we trust them to ensure that they will continue to support the NHS, invest in greater education and trade opportunities for our young, support the regeneration of our northern economy, or increase funding for local services?’</p>
      <p>Mr Punchard said ‘real change’ will only occur by voting for him and the Brexit Party on December 12.</p>
      <p>He added: ‘I have come here to win, not to muck about. I wouldn’t have come if I had not thought I could do it.’</p>
      <p>Tynemouth has been held by Labour’s Alan Campbell since 1997 and he is standing again.</p>
      <p>The other candidates are John Appleby for the Liberal Democrats, Lewis Bartoli for the Conservatives and Julia Erskine for the Greens.</p>
