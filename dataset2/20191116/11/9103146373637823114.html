        <b>There is more than enough on the menu today for rugby fans who will turn up at Kings Park Rugby Ground in Bweyogerere for the Uganda Cup final between Hima Cement Heathens and Betway Kobs.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The two sides have met in closely contested games before and that is what is expected to happen again.</p>
      <p>Defending champions Kampala Old Boys (Kobs) are seeking their seventh trophy while their Kyadondo rivals want to win it for the twelfth time.</p>
      <p>Kobs tactician Davis Kiwalabye believes that his side has the potential to win the trophy and will go for it.</p>
      <p>“We have tried perfect line outs, set pieces, defence, improved on scrummaging and we are ready for the challenge,” Kiwalabye stated.</p>
      <p>His team has been boosted by the return of centre Ian Munyani, fullbacks Joseph Aredo and Adrian Kasito who missed the semi-finals because they were on the national team for the Olympic qualifiers.</p>
      <p>He is also spoiled for choice on who to start in the flyhalf between Ivan Kirabo and James Ijongat all on form.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Heathens are boosted by the return of centre/winger Michael Wokorach, flyhalf Aaron Ofoyrwoth and scrum-half Kevin Keremundu, coach Muhammed Athio has all the confidence that his side will deliver.</p>
      <p>“We respect Kobs, they are a good side but we want to win the trophy,” Athio said.</p>
