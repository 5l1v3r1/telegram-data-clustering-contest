      <p><b>Hyderabad</b>: Nearly 15 Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC) employees were taken into custody by Falaknuma Police on Saturday when they were protesting in front of Farooq Nagar bus depot here.</p>
      <p>The RTC Joint Action Committee (JAC) has called for a 'Bus roko' protest in Telangana on Saturday.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Police personnel have been deployed in large numbers in places near bus depots. Section 144 has been imposed in the state.</p>
      <p>Striking employees of TSRTC have decided to temporarily drop their main demand for the Corporation's merger with the government.</p>
      <p>The JAC took the decision to keep aside the demand as the government showed no signs of softening its stand on the 41st day of the protest on November 14.</p>
      <p>The employees have now asked the government to fulfil their other demands.</p>
      <p>The employees have been on a strike since October 5 with several demands including revision of pay.</p>
      <p>At least five RTC employees have committed suicide since the commencement of the strike.</p>
