      <h1>Granit Xhaka aims dig at Arsenal after returning to action with Switzerland</h1>
      <h2>Granit Xhaka played for Switzerland against Georgia on Friday, his first outing since clashing with Arsenal fans in the draw with Crystal Palace</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T11:56:04+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 11:56</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Granit Xhaka has seemingly aimed a dig at Arsenal fans and Unai Emery after returning to action.</p>
      <p>Xhaka has not featured for the Gunners since his clash with supporters when he was substituted during the draw with <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> in October.</p>
      <p>The midfielder has since been stripped of the captaincy and it is unclear if he will play for the club again, with AC Milan and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> keen on a January transfer.</p>
      <p>Xhaka got some much-needed minutes on the board in Switzerland's Euro 2020 qualifying victory over Georgia on Friday night.</p>
      <p>And he took to social media to post a message, appearing to be a dig at the Gunners.</p>

      <p>Xhaka's post translated as: "Happiness is when you are satisfied with yourself and don't need the confirmation of others."</p>
      <p>The midfielder's hopes of returning to the fold appear bleak following the bust-up with supporters.</p>
      <p>Xhaka appeared to mouth "f*** off" as he made his way down the tunnel after gesturing to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> fans.</p>

      <p>Newcastle are interested in offering Xhaka a Premier League lifeline and could make a loan bid for the midfielder in January.</p>
      <p>Toon boss Steve Bruce is desperate to add some experience to his midfield as he bids to keep his side afloat.</p>
      <p>Bruce is hopeful he can use defender Fabian Schar to persuade his friend and international teammate to move to St James' Park.</p>
