      <p>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — At least seven people were killed and another 25 injured after a gas pipeline exploded in southeastern Bangladesh on Sunday, police said.</p>
      <p>The explosion at Patharghata area in Chittagong district collapsed portions of a boundary wall of a nearby building, local police chief Mohammed Mohsin said.</p>
      <p>He said at least 25 people were hospitalized and firefighters joined the rescue operation.</p>
      <p>It was not immediately clear what caused the explosion. News reports said the road in front of the explosion site was busy with people and tricycle rickshaws. A boundary wall fell on the people on the road.</p>
      <p>The explosion took place when residents were preparing for the day’s work in the morning, Mohsin said.</p>
      <p>Chittagong is 216 kilometers (134 miles) southeast of the capital, Dhaka.</p>
