      <p>A rally by 25 far-right Proud Boys was crashed by 300 protesters in Manhattan Saturday — and the two groups spent an hour hollering at each other across Fifth Avenue near Trump Tower.</p>
      <p>The Proud Boys had planned a rally to voice their opposition to two of their members <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/22/proud-boys-members-get-prison-for-brawl-with-antifa-protesters/">getting four-year prison sentences</a> last month for pummeling leftist Antifa members during a 2018 brawl on the Upper East Side.</p>
      <p>But Antifa members and other Proud Boy opponents found out about the rally plans, and counter-organized a larger shout-fest of their own.</p>
      <p>“F–k fascists!” the Antifa side shouted. “Free the boys!” shouted the MAGA-hat-topped Proud Boys.</p>
      <p>“The KKK and the Neo-Nazis are being unleashed by Grand Wizard Trump and his Christian-fascist sidekick Pence,” a man in black who stood with the lefty side shouted at one point.</p>
      <p>The groups, who were monitored by the NYPD, dispersed without any apparent violence by 3 p.m.</p>
