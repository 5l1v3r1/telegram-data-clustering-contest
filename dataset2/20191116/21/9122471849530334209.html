      <h1>Shea Patterson Reacts To Michigan’s Blowout vs. Michigan State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T21:42:46+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 21:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>If the Michigan Wolverines faced the Michigan State Spartans every week, Shea Patterson would be considered a Heisman Trophy candidate.</p>
      <p>Patterson entered this season with high expectations. Another year in Jim Harbaugh’s system was supposed to do wonders for the senior quarterback.</p>
      <p>The addition of Josh Gattis forced Michigan to make a few changes to its offense. After a few months of growing pains, it appears the Wolverines have found their identity on offense.</p>
      <p>Michigan is usually a team that values running more than passing. On Saturday, the script was completely flipped.</p>
      <p>Patterson completed 24-of-33 pass attempts for 384 yards, four touchdowns and no interceptions.</p>
      <p>Following the game, Patterson said “I wish I could have two more shots with them. Wish I could have started here and had four shots (at Michigan State).”</p>

      <p>It’s tough to blame Patterson for being confident after this win. He picked apart Michigan State’s secondary with relative ease this afternoon.</p>
      <p>Next up for the Wolverines is a meeting with the Indiana Hoosiers. They’ll need another strong performance from Patterson in that game.</p>
      <p>A strong finish to this season won’t just help Michigan’s chances of reaching a top bowl game, it could boost Patterson’s stock before the 2020 NFL Draft.</p>
