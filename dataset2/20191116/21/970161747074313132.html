      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/simon-cowell/">Simon Cowell</a> changed the rules of The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-x-factor/">X Factor</a>: Celebrity live on air – for a second time in two weeks.</p>
      <p>At the beginning of the show, the Syco boss announced that the show had scrapped the three ‘safe seats’ segment</p>
      <p>With one per judge, an act chosen for a safe seat would go automatically into the next week’s live show, thereby skipping the all-important public vote.</p>
      <p>But it seems, after backlash from fans, the music mogul had a change of heart.</p>
      <p>When grilled by host Dermot O’Leary, Cowell said: ‘I actually do read social media, and they said they hated [the safe seats] so they’ve gone.’</p>
      <p>Just like that, ey!</p>
      <p>Dermot did also make the very good point that realistically ‘someone [Simon] pays reads social media and told you they hated them.’</p>

      <p>Which the 60-year-old fessed up to too, so fair play to him for that!</p>

      <p>Of course, this comes just one week after Si changed his mind regarding the live final of the signing show, implementing a public vote for the most popular eliminated act to take part in the finale.</p>
      <p>That was seemingly made up on the spot, and it seemed like this was too.</p>
      <p>Cowell may also bring yet another shocking change to the show – .and it all has to do with a certain <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/love-island/">Love Island</a> star going solo.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Metro.co.uk on the red carpet for the ITV Palooza, we may have mentioned in passing (as we have done<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/14/simon-cowell-might-have-just-saved-the-x-factor-from-itself-10916015/"> in writing</a>) that Samira could very well just dump the rest of No Love Lost and return as a solo act – preferably singing Motivation by Normani.</p>
      <p>And to our actual surprise,<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/simon-cowell-thinks-love-islands-samira-should-go-solo-on-the-x-factor-celebrity-after-shock-elimination-11091642/"> the Syco mogul seemed to…kind of agree?</a></p>
      <p>‘That’s actually a very, very good idea,’ he told us. ‘Do you want to tell the other Islanders?’</p>
