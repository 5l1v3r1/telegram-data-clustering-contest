      <p>The Duke of York has claimed he was at Pizza Express with his daughter on the day he was alleged to have had sex with a 17-year-old.</p>
      <p>Prince Andrew addressed his relationship with disgraced billionaire Jeffrey Epstein for the first time during Saturday's BBC Newsnight interview.</p>
      <p>Financier Epstein, 66, was found dead in his prison cell in New York earlier this year where he was being held on sex trafficking charges.</p>
      <p>Virginia Giuffre, formerly known as Virginia Roberts, is one of 16 women who says she was abused by Epstein, and also named Andrew in previous court papers.</p>
      <p>She claims she was forced into a sexual encounter with Andrew when she was 17 years old, an allegation he denies.</p>

      <p>During the course of the hour interview, the royal claimed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>He was at Pizza Express with Beatrice on the day of his alleged meeting with Virginia Giuffre</li>
        <li>He had no recollection of a photo taken with him and Ms Giuffre - adding he does not give public displays of affection in public and wears certain clothes while out in London.</li>
        <li>He is not able to sweat due to a medical condition - contradicting claims he had been sweating while dancing with the teenager in Tramp nightclub.</li>
        <li>He does not have a message for Ms Guiffre because he has "thick skin", and the allegations "never happened".</li>
      </ul>
      <p>During the interview, Prince Andrew said he had met Epstein through his former girlfriend.</p>
      <p>He said: "I met through his girlfriend back in 1999 and I had known her since she was in university in the UK. It would be to some extent a stretch to say we [Epstein and I] were close friends.</p>
      <p>"I had a lot of opportunities to go to the United States but I didn't have much time with him. I saw him once or twice a year, perhaps three times a year."</p>
      <p>Asked if he trusted Epstein, he answered: "I probably did. I don't go into a friendship looking for the wrong thing if you understand me. I want to find out, I want to learn. You have to remember I was transitioning out of the Navy at the time I wanted to find more about what was going on."</p>

      <p>The Duke of York also stressed there was "never any indication" of Jeffrey Epstein's trafficking during his visits to his home.</p>
      <p>He said: "There was no indication to me or anyone else that was what he was doing.</p>
      <p>"When I saw him in the US, or when I was staying at his house in the UK there was no indication of what he was doing.</p>
      <p>"At the time I was patron of the NSPCC Full Stop campaign so I was close up about getting rid of abuse to children. I know what the things were to look for but I never made that connection."</p>
      <p>The Duke of York also addressed his decision to stay at Epstein's house for a number of days after travelling over to "break up" their friendship in 2010.</p>
      <p>During that time, the pair were photographed walking in Central Park.</p>
      <p>He said: "My judgement was coloured by my tendency to be too honourable, that's just the way it is."</p>

      <p>Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis asked Prince Andrew about a witness accounts of "young girls" leaving Esptein's house at the time.</p>
      <p>He said: "There were people coming and going out of that house all the time. What they were doing and why they were there I had nothing to do with."</p>
      <p>He also rejected accounts that he received a "foot massage" by a young Russian girl.</p>
      <p>Asked if he regretted his friendship with Epstein, he said he did not.</p>
      <p>He said: "The people I met and the opportunities that I was given to learn either by him or because of him were actually very useful.</p>
      <p>"We weren't that close. Yes I would stay in his house but because of his girlfriend, not because of him."</p>
      <p>Addressing the accusations involving Ms Guiffre, Andrew told the BBC he had no idea how a picture of him with his arm around Ms Giuffre came about.</p>
      <p>He added that he rarely poses for pictures, and does not give displays of affection in public.</p>
      <p>He said: "I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever.</p>
      <p>"I don't believe it's a picture of me in London because when I would out to... When I go out in London, I wear a suit and a tie."</p>
      <p>The Duke added that he had been in Pizza Express with his daughter Beatrice on the day he is alleged to have had sex with Ms Guiffre.</p>
      <p>He also rejected descriptions that he had been sweating while dancing with Ms Guiffre in Tramp nightclub.</p>
      <p>According to the royal, it is "impossible" for him to sweat due to a medical condition caused by an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands War.</p>
      <p>He said: “I was at home, I was with the children, I had taken Beatrice to a Pizza Express in Woking for a party.</p>
      <p>"Going to Pizza Express in Woking is an unusual thing for me to do, a very unusual thing for me to do.</p>
      <p>"I've never been... I've only been to Woking a couple of times and I remember it weirdly distinctly. As soon as somebody reminded me of it, I went: 'Oh yes, I remember that'."</p>
      <p>The royal denied ever meeting Ms Guiffre, and said he had "no message for her".</p>
      <p>Buckingham Palace has branded the allegations "false and without any foundation" and said "any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors" by the duke was "categorically untrue".</p>
      <p>It is the first time the duke has answered questions on his relationship with Epstein. In 2015, he used a public appearance at Davos in Switzerland to deny the claims.</p>
