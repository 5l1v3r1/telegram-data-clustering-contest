        <b>The Brazilian Grand Prix promises to be another good one, and with one grid penalty to take into account already, here is the provisional starting grid for Sunday's race.</b>

      <h3>Qualifying recap</h3>
      <p>The slightly surprising pole-sitter after qualifying was Max Verstappen, who set the quickest time on a Saturday for the second time in three weeks (although his time in Mexico got scrapped).</p>

      <p>Verstappen had provisional pole after his first run in Q3 already, and the 22-year-old improved on his time in his second run, setting a blisteringly quick 1:07.506. He was one tenth quicker than second-placed Sebastian Vettel, with Lewis Hamilton completing the top three.</p>
      <p>Charles Leclerc might have set the fourth-quickest time, but he'll drop 10 places because of a grid penalty for swapping power units for the fourth time. </p>
      <p>Another notable performance is the one from Haas, who got both cars in Q3 for the first time in half a season.</p>
