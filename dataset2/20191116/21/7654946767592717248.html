      <h1>Colin Kaepernick wows NFL executive at very chaotic workout</h1>

      <p>Colin Kaerpernick took another stand on Saturday — this time against the NFL.</p>
      <p>Just 15 minutes before the lightning-rod quarterback was scheduled to work out for 25 NFL teams at the Falcons’ training complex in Flowery Branch, Ga., as part of a league-arranged event, Kaepernick’s representatives announced the session had been moved 60 miles away to Charles Drew High School in Riverdale — south of the city, near the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.</p>
      <p>The stunning move, which left the NFL “disappointed” and seemed to catch everyone off-guard, came about an hour before the scheduled workout was set to begin, putting many in scramble mode.</p>
      <p>Only eight teams showed up for the workout, Kaepernick’s camp said, and an NFL executive <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1195839299658362880?s=20">told ESPN</a> that the former Pro Bowler’s arm talent was “elite” and he threw the ball well.</p>
      <p>The Giants and Jets were slated to attend the original workout, and a Getty Images photo from Saturday showed one man at the workout wearing Jets apparel, however, it’s unclear if he was there representing the team.</p>
      <p>Several NFL fans showed up to the Falcons’ facility early Saturday with signs for and against Kaepernick, the former 49ers quarterback who hasn’t played in the league since 2016 after kneeling during the national anthem in protest of racial injustice and police brutality.</p>
      <p>Kaepernick’s representatives said they hijacked the workout so the media could watch and videotape Kaepernick on the field.</p>
      <p>The NFL had previously declined to allow any media or cameras at the workout, as Kaepernick had requested. The 32-year-old’s representatives also said the NFL “demanded” as a precondition for this workout and that he sign an “unusual liability waiver.”</p>

      <p>“From the outset, Mr. Kaepernick requested a legitimate process and from the outset the NFL league office has not provided one,” his representatives said in a statement.</p>
      <p>At the end of the workout, Kaepernick thanked the media and team representatives for attending and said, “our biggest thing with everything today was making sure we had transparency with what went on.</p>
      <p>“We weren’t getting that elsewhere… I’ve been ready for three years, I’ve been denied for three years… We’re waiting for the 32 owners of the 32 teams, (commissioner) Roger Goodell, all of them to stop running. Running from the truth. Stop running from the people,” said Kaepernick, who settled a collusion grievance with the league for an undisclosed amount last winter.</p>
      <p>Kaepernick wore a “Kunta Kinte” T-shirt, based on the fictional African slave in the 1976 novel, “Roots: The Saga of an American Family.”</p>
      <p>In a statement, the NFL said it was “disappointed that Colin did not appear for his workout.”</p>
      <p>The league referenced recent negotiations with Kaepernick’s representatives over the workout and citing, among others, media availability and a liability waiver.</p>
      <p>“Colin’s decision has no effect on his status in the league. He remains an unrestricted free agent eligible to sign with any club,” the NFL statement said.</p>
      <p>Kaepernick said he was alerted of the initial workout only last week. The NFL in February settled a collusion grievance Kaepernick and former teammate Eric Reid filed against the league. Reid now plays for the Panthers, and was at the newly scheduled workout.</p>
      <p>Free agents Bruce Ellington (Kaepernick’s former teammate in San Francisco), Brice Butler and Jordan Veasy were also at the workout, according to multiple reports.</p>
