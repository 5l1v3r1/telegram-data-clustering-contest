        <b>Robyn (Amanda Henderson) faced every parent’s worst nightmare in tonight’s Casualty, as her child went missing. On yet another day when the department was under strain (this time from a CQC inspection) and short of nurses, Charlie (Derek Thompson) persuaded an off-duty Robyn to work an extra shift. Duffy (Cathy Shipton) volunteered to look after Robyn’s daughter Charlotte and it seemed like the perfect arrangement all round.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Duffy is usually very aware of her limitations around her dementia, and reassured Robyn that she and Charlotte would stay at home all day. But later, Duffy forgot this promise and took Charlotte out to the park. There, she experienced one of the frightening episodes we’ve seen her have recently, where she becomes confused about where she is and what’s happening. She managed to find her way to the safe harbour of Charlie and the ED – but Charlotte wasn’t with her.</p>

      <p>Robyn’s panic when she realised what had happened was all too relatable and there was a real sense of dread as she dashed off to look for Charlotte herself, desperately hunting in the wrong park. Back at the ED there was terrible news – a three year old girl had been involved in a car accident and was being brought in. Luckily this turned out not to be Charlotte. Robyn had the idea of looking on Duffy’s phone to see if she’d taken any photos of the park and she had. Robyn dashed off yet again, this time with Charlie in tow, and they found Charlotte safe and well.</p>
      <p>Back at the hospital Will (Jack Nolan) checked Charlotte over and was lovely and reassuring with Robyn, but unsurprisingly Robyn was upset. She accused Charlie of lying to her about Duffy being a safe pair of hands for Charlotte just so Robyn would work. It was clear that Charlie is not accepting how bad things really are for his wife and Robyn told him she’s not prepared to risk Charlotte’s life on whether Duffy is having a good day or a bad day. This is perfectly understandable, but another huge blow for Charlie as Robyn is a good friend and he’s feeling increasingly isolated.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile the day started out quite well for Ethan (George Rainsford) as he gave Effie (Abigail Hardingham) a key to his house. Effie said she was ‘determined to grab all the good things’ from life while she still can, and Ethan was very much looking forward to being one of the good things that Effie could grab. But when she found herself a room in a house share he realised that he needs to let her go because he’s not spontaneous and would only hold her back.</p>

      <p>And Rash (Neet Mohan) and Mason (Victor Oshin) have finally started to work as a team, with each of them covering for the other when a tricky case almost got them in hot water with Dylan (William Beck). How long this new bromance will last, it remains to be seen.</p>
