      <h1>New York’s oldest charity to vote on allowing female members after 235 years</h1>

      <p>After more than two centuries, this boy’s club is finally woke.</p>
      <p>Members of the Society of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick, the city’s oldest charity, will vote on a resolution this week to allow women to become members.</p>
      <p>The proposed change to the bylaws of the 235-year-old non-profit comes on the heels of another milestone for the group — inviting female guests to its annual black-tie fundraising dinner in Manhattan in March.</p>
      <p>This year, the lavish dinner at the Sheraton Hotel even featured two women speakers — broadcaster Maria Bartiromo and former UN ambassador Nikki Haley.</p>
      <p>“I want to congratulate you for inviting your wives, your daughters, your moms, any women you invited here tonight,” Haley told the group. “It is a significant milestone. It only took 235 years. Way to go guys.”</p>
      <p>The motion, which will be voted on Monday, starchly notes that “while it was perfectly acceptable to establish an all-male society in 1784 and to maintain the all-male policy for more than two centuries, cultural and social norms have changed such that organizations … are expected to be more inclusive.”</p>
      <p>It also noted that by accepting women the charity would “bolster the ranks of our membership by welcoming talented and successful Irish daughters who share our appreciation of Irish culture.”</p>
      <p>The New York branch of the Society of the Friendly Sons is an offshoot of a group set up to help Irish immigrants in Philadelphia on St. Patrick’s Day in 1771. Its early members included George Washington and other heroes of the Revolutionary War.</p>
      <p>And while the Philadelphia group decided to allow women to become members in 2016, making then-Irish ambassador Anne Anderson an honorary member, the New York chapter stopped short.</p>
      <p>“This is a charitable organization, and there is no need to have only men running it,” said a retired Irish-American businesswoman who did not want to be identified. “They need women to shore up their membership, but I’m not so sure this motion is going to pass.”</p>
      <p>For some men, allowing women into the all-male charity, which gives out scholarships and doles out cash to Catholic schools in the city, may still be too radical a move.</p>
      <p>“There are times when guys just want to hang out with other guys,” said Donald Daly, in a comment posted to the Irish Central, a web site that covers the Irish community in New York. “The whole tenor of the group changes when you introduce women into the membership. This is not sexist or misogynistic, it’s just a fact.”</p>
      <p>The Society of Friendly Sons of St. Patrick did not return The Post’s call for comment last week.</p>
