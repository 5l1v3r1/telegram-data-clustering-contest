      <p>"Beauty editors and hairstylists alike will agree on how innovative the Dyson Supersonic Hair Dryer was when it first launched in 2016. After all, it took a team of over 100 engineers to develop it. Since then, it has become a go-to for hair pros, and it is the only hairdryer to cut my average dry time in half. I have medium-coarse, wavy hair that is so thick, my hairstylist at my most recent blowout actually got tired and took a break while drying it. I snapped on one of its magnetic attachments and began running the concentrated warm air against my hair. With the help of one of its magnetic attachments, it took four minutes and 16 seconds to dry my hair — and that was with a break to mess with its three temperature settings.</p>
      <p>Other highlights include its lightweight body (it comes in weighing just above a pound without attachments) and motor that sits at the base of its handle and doesn't make the thunderous noise you'd expect from the average dryer.</p>
      <p>This blow dryer already has a sleek, futuristic body but is getting an equally sophisticated makeover for this Winter.

      <p>"I live with other beauty editors, and two of us had the new <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/buy/Briogeo-Dont-Despair-Repair-Honey-Moisture-Deep-Conditioning-Mask-510271?url_pos=body-url&amp;p_name=Briogeo%20Don%27t%20Despair%2C%20Repair%21%20Honey%20Moisture%20Deep%20Conditioning%20Mask&amp;retailer=briogeohair.com&amp;pid=510271&amp;price=36&amp;evar1=bella%3Aus&amp;evar3=article%3Agallery-slide%3Apss&amp;evar9=46839440&amp;evar98=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popsugar.com%2Fbeauty%2Fphoto-gallery%2F46839440%2Fimage%2F46839529%2FBriogeo-Dont-Despair-Repair-Honey-Moisture-Deep-Conditioning-Mask&amp;list1=hair%2Cbeauty%20products%2Cbeauty%20shopping&amp;prop13=desktop&amp;page_name=bella%3Aus%3Aarticle%3Abest-hair-products-november-2019-46839440&amp;pdata=19395787">Briogeo Don't Despair, Repair! Honey Moisture Deep Conditioning Mask</a> ($36) in our haircare rotation at one point. Not only is the bear-shaped bottle an adorable addition to our shower niche, but it also works wonders on our very different hair types. The emollient mask is packed with moisturizing honey and oils (like almond and rosehip) that define and soften my medium-coarse waves and leave them smelling sweet." — JMC</p>
      <p>"I've been using the original Don't Despair, Repair! Mask for about a year to keep my fine waves deeply hydrated and free of frizz, so when I saw this new limited-edition <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/buy/Briogeo-Dont-Despair-Repair-Honey-Moisture-Deep-Conditioning-Mask-510271?url_pos=body-url&amp;p_name=Briogeo%20Don%27t%20Despair%2C%20Repair%21%20Honey%20Moisture%20Deep%20Conditioning%20Mask&amp;retailer=briogeohair.com&amp;pid=510271&amp;price=36&amp;evar1=bella%3Aus&amp;evar3=article%3Agallery-slide%3Apss&amp;evar9=46839440&amp;evar98=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popsugar.com%2Fbeauty%2Fphoto-gallery%2F46839440%2Fimage%2F46839529%2FBriogeo-Dont-Despair-Repair-Honey-Moisture-Deep-Conditioning-Mask&amp;list1=hair%2Cbeauty%20products%2Cbeauty%20shopping&amp;prop13=desktop&amp;page_name=bella%3Aus%3Aarticle%3Abest-hair-products-november-2019-46839440&amp;pdata=19395787">Honey Moisture Deep Conditioning Mask</a> ($36) version, I immediately grabbed it.

      <p>"I usually run in the opposite direction of any hair oil for fear of completely weighing mine down, but after getting a bob haircut last month — and therefore either straightening or curling it every day thereafter — I've noticed moisture has actually been running away from <i>me</i>. Here to help is the lightweight <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/buy/RCo-Two-Way-Mirror-Smoothing-Oil-510289?url_pos=body-url&amp;p_name=R%2BCo%20Two%20Way%20Mirror%20Smoothing%20Oil&amp;retailer=randco.com&amp;pid=510289&amp;price=32&amp;evar1=bella%3Aus&amp;evar3=article%3Agallery-slide%3Apss&amp;evar9=46839440&amp;evar98=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popsugar.com%2Fbeauty%2Fphoto-gallery%2F46839440%2Fimage%2F46839560%2FRCo-Two-Way-Mirror-Smoothing-Oil&amp;list1=hair%2Cbeauty%20products%2Cbeauty%20shopping&amp;prop13=desktop&amp;page_name=bella%3Aus%3Aarticle%3Abest-hair-products-november-2019-46839440&amp;pdata=19395787">R+Co Two Way Mirror Smoothing Oil</a> ($32): it's formulated with heavy hitters like moringa and argan oils to inject a dose of hydration into my ends without ever feeling greasy. The best part? You only need one pump, which means this bottle will last me . . . oh, I don't know, two lifetimes." — Kelsey Castañon, senior editor, Beauty</p>
      <h3>Prose Custom Dry Shampoo</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>"This month, I was all about customized hair care. I couldn't believe that Prose had managed to customize dry shampoo and immediately filled out the brand's survey to get my own version. My <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/buy/Prose-Dry-Shampoo-510269?url_pos=body-url&amp;p_name=Prose%20Dry%20Shampoo&amp;retailer=prose.com&amp;pid=510269&amp;price=25&amp;evar1=bella%3Aus&amp;evar3=article%3Agallery-slide%3Apss&amp;evar9=46839440&amp;evar98=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popsugar.com%2Fbeauty%2Fphoto-gallery%2F46839440%2Fimage%2F46839516%2FProse-Custom-Dry-Shampoo&amp;list1=hair%2Cbeauty%20products%2Cbeauty%20shopping&amp;prop13=desktop&amp;page_name=bella%3Aus%3Aarticle%3Abest-hair-products-november-2019-46839440&amp;pdata=19395787">Prose Dry Shampoo</a> ($25) was formulated for fine, wavy hair and came in a pump instead of a spray. I really liked this eco-friendly dispenser and found it easy to work the product through my hair. A lot of aerosol sprays also dry out my already-itchy scalp, but this version kept oil away without any dehydration. I also liked that it gave me the added volume I love from dry shampoo without the white cast I can't stand." — SS</p>
      <p>"Not to be dramatic, but I am nothing without my dry shampoo. It is my holy grail hair product that saves me from bad hair days. Lately, I've been loving the <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/buy/Prose-Dry-Shampoo-510269?url_pos=body-url&amp;p_name=Prose%20Dry%20Shampoo&amp;retailer=prose.com&amp;pid=510269&amp;price=25&amp;evar1=bella%3Aus&amp;evar3=article%3Agallery-slide%3Apss&amp;evar9=46839440&amp;evar98=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popsugar.com%2Fbeauty%2Fphoto-gallery%2F46839440%2Fimage%2F46839516%2FProse-Custom-Dry-Shampoo&amp;list1=hair%2Cbeauty%20products%2Cbeauty%20shopping&amp;prop13=desktop&amp;page_name=bella%3Aus%3Aarticle%3Abest-hair-products-november-2019-46839440&amp;pdata=19395787">Prose Dry Shampoo</a> ($25). It's a truly translucent powder that you spray directly onto the roots, let sit for one minute, and gently massage through your scalp. It instantly absorbs any oil and refreshes your hair to offer that salon blowout look with minimal effort. A little goes such a long way, which is comforting to know I won't have to part with my dry shampoo for quite some time." — Genesis Rivas, assistant editor, Makeup.com</p>

      <p>"I've been a Shu Uemura fan for at least a decade, with the brand's oil cleanser and cleaning oil shampoo constantly stocked in my bathroom. For some strange reason, I had never tried the hair masks, and man, was I missing out! The Pokémon Pikachu packaging on the limited-edition <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/buy/Shu-Uemura-Art-Hair-Pok%C3%A9mon-Hair-Mask-510273?url_pos=body-url&amp;p_name=Shu%20Uemura%20Art%20of%20Hair%20Pok%C3%A9mon%20Hair%20Mask&amp;retailer=shuuemuraartofhair-usa.com&amp;pid=510273&amp;price=68&amp;evar1=bella%3Aus&amp;evar3=article%3Agallery-slide%3Apss&amp;evar9=46839440&amp;evar98=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popsugar.com%2Fbeauty%2Fphoto-gallery%2F46839440%2Fimage%2F46839559%2FShu-Uemura-Art-Hair-Pok%C3%A9mon-Hair-Mask&amp;list1=hair%2Cbeauty%20products%2Cbeauty%20shopping&amp;prop13=desktop&amp;page_name=bella%3Aus%3Aarticle%3Abest-hair-products-november-2019-46839440&amp;pdata=19395787">Shu Uemura Art of Hair Pokémon Hair Mask</a> ($68) is as irresistible as the gold sparkly cream inside. But what really won me over were the silky strands I had after just a few minutes using this mask. My hair is ultrasleek and shiny, and I could still go my usual three days between shampoos without feeling weighed down. This is definitely a new fave." — Joanna Douglas, senior editorial director, Native</p>

      <p>"Although many people can't get enough of hair serums and oils, I tend to stay away from them because they weigh down my fine hair. When Function of Beauty announced its customized <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/buy/Hair-Serum-510270?url_pos=body-url&amp;p_name=Hair%20Serum&amp;retailer=functionofbeauty.com&amp;pid=510270&amp;price=19&amp;evar1=bella%3Aus&amp;evar3=article%3Agallery-slide%3Apss&amp;evar9=46839440&amp;evar98=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popsugar.com%2Fbeauty%2Fphoto-gallery%2F46839440%2Fimage%2F46839530%2FFunction-Beauty-Hair-Serum&amp;list1=hair%2Cbeauty%20products%2Cbeauty%20shopping&amp;prop13=desktop&amp;page_name=bella%3Aus%3Aarticle%3Abest-hair-products-november-2019-46839440&amp;pdata=19395787">Hair Serum</a> ($19), I was intrigued to see if one made for my hair would work better for me. I filled out the questionnaire with my hair goals and preferred scent and awaited my serum. Once it arrived, I was pleased to find that the nude peach scent smelled exactly like candy peach rings and the formula gave my hair shine, eliminated frizz, and concealed split ends without adding extra weight to my waves. I am ecstatic to have finally found a serum I like and have been using it nearly every day." — SS</p>

I, however, didn't test a CBD product for my hair. This vitamin-rich shampoo boasts that the buzzy ingredient — plus vitamins A, C, and E — will repair and rejuvenate hair. After washing with it, my hair was actually shining and felt smooth and hydrated to the touch. The antioxidants in CBD not only help protect against damage and breakage but also guard your scalp against free radical damage (something I never realized I needed until now)." — Jessica Harrington, assistant editor, Makeup.com</p>

The new packaging is part of the Shu Uemura Art of Hair x Pokémon line, in which the famous Japanese brand rereleased go-to products in cute limited-edition packaging. This shampoo has quickly become a staple in my routine because it gently cleanses my hair without stripping it of natural oils, leaving my hair clean, shiny, and soft. While many shampoos irritate my scalp, this one leaves it feeling fresh and hydrated." — SS</p>
