      <p>Paul Walker’s character, Brian O’Conner, could be making a surprise return to the Fast and Furious franchise, six years after his death.</p>
      <p>The actor passed away back in 2013, aged 40, tragically losing his life in a car crash.</p>
      <p>Brothers Cody and Caleb Walker filmed his final scenes in Furious 7, with producers also using CGI to give him a fitting goodbye.</p>
      <p>But it has now been claimed Brian will be coming back in the upcoming F9 film – alongside Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris.</p>
      <p>According to LadBible, sources close to the casting department state they are looking for a Paul Walker double.</p>
      <p>‘Just got a new casting grid for something and with it some big news that are sure to be controversial,’ Twitter user Daniel Richtman shared with his 78.5k followers.</p>
      <p>‘Not sure how I feel about it myself but we’ll see.’</p>

      <p>‘They are bringing back Paul Walker’s character, Brian, to FF9,’ he later added.</p>

      <p>And, despite the news not being confirmed yet, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/18/furious-9-needs-let-paul-walker-rest-peace-amid-hints-character-will-return-6-years-death-10590024/">fans are not best pleased</a>.</p>
      <p>Flocking to Twitter, one wrote: ‘I’m not a fan of the FF movies but still this is a big no from me.’</p>
      <p>‘Completely undermining the ending of Fast 7 and Paul himself. Disgraceful,’ another commented.</p>
      <p>While an unimpressed user said: ‘No, Paul’s character Brian had a beautiful sendoff that doesn’t need to be used to gain more money from. It gave us a sense of closure and finality to his and Jordana’s respective characters.’</p>

      <p>‘I’m sorry that scene at end of Furious 7 was magical, this will taint it,’ a follower added.</p>
      <p>Cody previously <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/11/paul-walkers-brother-cody-remains-coy-over-fast-and-furious-return-for-brian-oconner-10550557/">opened up about potentially returning as Paul</a>, after he filmed scenes for Furious 7.</p>
      <p>And, speaking to <b>Metro.co.uk</b>, he left the door open for a comeback, telling us: ‘You know there’s a lot of things that are said about the franchise, there’s a lot of rumours going around.</p>
      <p>‘I think anything is possible and we’ll see what the future has in store.</p>
      <p>‘There are a lot of things that are said out there.</p>
