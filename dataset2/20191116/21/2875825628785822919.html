      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Audacious masked raiders try to raid Sky football pundit Jamie Redknapp's Surrey home TWICE in one day</h2>

      <p>Jamie Redknapp’s family were said to be shaken last night after his home was targeted by masked raiders TWICE in one day.</p>
      <p>The Sky footie pundit, 46, was away at the time but his housekeeper was in the £6million pad as the gang made their first attempt to break in.</p>
      <p>She made a frantic 999 call and the raiders fled the property in Oxshott, Surrey – which Jamie shared with pop star ex Louise.</p>
      <p>But in a brazen move, the raiders returned in the early hours for another crack.</p>
      <p>This time, Jamie’s alarm system flagged them up – but the gang managed to break into one of his cars and stole a number of valuable items from the boot.</p>

      <p>Police arrived at 5.14am on Tuesday but the thieves had already scarpered.</p>
      <p>Jamie and Louise, who divorced after 19 years and share custody of sons Charley, 15, and Beau, 11, remain close and a source said the incident has shaken the family.</p>
      <p>They said: “The thinking is the gang had been monitoring Jamie’s social ­media and seen he was out of the country.</p>
      <p>“Jamie has been targeted before and he had already stepped up his ­security.</p>
      <p>“The property is surrounded by tall hedgerows and has a set of large electronic gates at the entrance as well as a state-of-the-art alarm. The kids were pretty shaken up by it all and were asking a lot of questions.</p>
      <p>“Jamie and Louise have reassured them that everything would be OK but obviously it’s a pretty harrowing thing for them to all go through.”</p>
      <p>Last night, Surrey Police said enquiries were still ongoing and they could not give any details of what was swiped.</p>
      <p>A force spokesman said: “We were called to a report of a man breaking into a car in Oxshott. A number of items are believed to have been taken from the boot.</p>
      <p>“An area search was undertaken and some items were recovered.</p>
      <p>“Further enquiries established two men were seen acting suspiciously in the area earlier in the morning and another vehicle was entered but nothing was taken.”</p>
      <p>When Jamie and Louise got divorced, he stayed on in the family home while Louise bought a pad around the corner.</p>
      <p>She has recently revealed she poured her pain at their split into some of the songs on her new solo album Heavy Love – the former Eternal star’s first record in 18 years.</p>
      <p>Jamie’s spokesman was contacted for comment.</p>
