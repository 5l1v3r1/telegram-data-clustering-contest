      <h1>UFC Fight Night Blachovicz vs. Jacare: Live results, recaps and analysis</h1>

      <p>The stakes will be high when <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2506250/jan-blachowicz">Jan Blachowicz</a> and <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2431314/jacare-souza">Ronaldo "Jacare" Souza</a> step into the Octagon for the main event of Saturday's UFC Fight Night at Ginásio do Ibirapuera in Sao Paulo, Brazil.</p>
      <p>Blachowicz (24-8) is a light heavyweight title contender, No. 7 in the ESPN rankings, coming off July's knockout of former middleweight champion <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2519811/luke-rockhold">Luke Rockhold</a>. And now comes another ex-185-pounder. Souza (26-7) is moving up to 205 in the wake of April's loss to <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/3074102/jack-hermansson">Jack Hermansson</a>, his second defeat in three fights.</p>
      <p>But Jacare can become an instant contender with a win, and Blachowicz needs to have his hand raised to avoid falling out of the top 10.</p>
      <p>This main event will be the finale of a long night of Brazil vs. the World. Jacare is one of 15 Brazilians on the card, with at least one in each of the 12 fights. And there are some legendary names among them, most notably <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2335514/mauricio-rua">Mauricio "Shogun" Rua</a>, who fights in the co-main event. Shogun, a former UFC light heavyweight champion, has won eight postfight bonuses in his time with the promotion. He's already in the UFC Hall of Fame, for his wild 2011 fight with <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2335497/dan-henderson">Dan Henderson</a>.</p>
      <p>Rua's opponent, <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/3946951/paul-craig">Paul Craig</a>, is a Scotsman who is on the verge of the UFC record book. He has won two fights in the promotion by triangle choke; one more would give him the record. A Craig submission of any kind would be his fifth, tying the light heavyweight record.</p>
