      <p>Two couples are neck and neck on Strictly Come Dancing after wowing judges in Blackpool.</p>
      <p>Kelvin Fletcher and Karim Zeroual have stunned the Strictly panel in the Tower Ballroom.</p>
      <p>CBBC presenter Zeroual was hailed as “flawless” for his Charleston, and Fletcher was branded “formidable” for an energetic jive.</p>
      <p>In a moment of Strictly history, Anton Du Beke was awarded his first ever 10s on the show.</p>

      <p>But it was Fletcher who first sealed a place at the top of the leaderboard, earning a score of 39 with partner Oti Mabuse for their Elvis-inspired performance.</p>
      <p>Shirley Ballas said of the dance: “I’m speechless. You owned it, you gave it, you controlled it. I was impressed.”</p>
      <p>Craig Revel Horwood added: “The strength, the stamina, the agility, absolutely formidable.”</p>
      <p>Couples were joined on the famous spring floor by backing dancers, but all eyes were on Zeroual as he performed an almost perfect Charleston with Amy Dowden.</p>
      <p>They were also narrowly denied a perfect score on the show, with judges nevertheless wowed by the number.</p>
      <p>Motsi Mabuse said: “I’m absolutely speechless. I can’t give you more than the 10, but it doesn’t justify how well you dance. You killed it.”</p>
      <p>Ballas added: “You were absolutely flawless. You are a star.”</p>

      <p>The scores tie Fletcher and Zeroual at the top of the leaderboard, while Michelle Visage and Giovanni Pernice have found themselves bottom with a score of 32.</p>
      <p>Also in the bottom two after the famous annual visit to the Blackpool Tower Ballroom are comedian Chris Ramsey and Karen Hauer with 33.</p>
      <p>Du Beke and Emma Barton pulled off a successful American smooth, managing a total of 37, and the professional’s first 10s on the show despite him participating in 17 series.</p>
      <p>Revel Horwood: “Beautiful movement around the floor, elegant, graceful.”</p>
      <p>Mabuse added: “I think that was the best since you started Strictly.”</p>
      <p>Stunned after breaking his duck, Du Beke told his partner: “Seventeen series, you don’t understand.”</p>
      <p>Neil Jones and Alex Scott danced the paso doble and managed a score of 34.</p>
      <p>Last week’s leaderboard frontrunners AJ Pritchard and Saffron Barker danced a blistering quickstep and got a score of 35.</p>
