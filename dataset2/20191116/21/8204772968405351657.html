      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Max+Verstappen">Max Verstappen</a> sealed pole position at the Brazilian Grand Prix on Saturday and served it up to a delighted Red Bull team principal <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Christian+Horner">Christian Horner</a> as a 46th birthday present.</p>
      <p>The pole was the second of the Dutch 22-year-old’s Formula One career and the first in Brazil for engine partners Honda since the late triple champion <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Ayrton+Senna">Ayrton Senna</a> in 1991 with McLaren.</p>
      <p>“The car was on fire and I hope that was a nice birthday present, Christian,” Verstappen said over the team radio after clocking a best lap around Interlagos of one minute 07.508 seconds.</p>
      <p>“That was the best birthday present you could have given me. Well done. Brilliant in all three sessions. So thank you very much for that,” replied Horner.</p>
      <p>Ferrari’s <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Sebastian+Vettel">Sebastian Vettel</a> joined Verstappen on the front row, a tenth of a second off the pole time, for what will be his 100th start for the Italian team after winning four championships with Red Bull.</p>
      <p>“I had a bit of a wobble at the exit of the last corner on the first run but I think Max improved his time, so fair play. I think it’s his pole position,” said Vettel.</p>
      <p>“I think both Red Bull and Mercedes look a bit stronger managing tyres but we’ve got the speed and we’ve got the power,” added the German.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Lewis+Hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a>, who clinched his sixth world championship in Texas two weeks ago and was quickest in final practice, will line up third for Mercedes with team-mate <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Valtteri+Bottas">Valtteri Bottas</a> alongside.</p>
      <p>“We’ve been down on power, I guess, compared to the others particularly, that’s where we lose most of our time,” said Hamilton. “But I gave it absolutely everything I had and I’m glad at the end.”</p>
      <p>Ferrari’s <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Charles+Leclerc">Charles Leclerc</a> qualified in fourth place but drops 10 places due to an engine change.</p>
      <p>With both championships won by Mercedes for an unprecedented sixth year in a row, Sunday’s penultimate race of the season is likely to focus on the battle to be best of the rest.</p>
      <p>Leclerc is third overall and leads Verstappen by 14 points, with Vettel a further five adrift.</p>
      <p>For Red Bull there is also unfinished business after Verstappen missed out on victory in Brazil last year when he tangled with backmarker <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Esteban+Ocon">Esteban Ocon</a> while leading.</p>
      <p>“I’ll try to finish it off now,” promised Verstappen.</p>
      <p>There is every chance of the youngster making amends on Sunday, with the winner in Brazil starting on pole position in five of the last six races there.</p>
      <p>Verstappen, however, failed to convert his previous pole, in Hungary last August, into victory with Hamilton going on to celebrate instead.</p>
      <p>Red Bull’s <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Alexander+Albon">Alexander Albon</a> will start in fifth place with <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Pierre+Gasly">Pierre Gasly</a>, the French driver he replaced earlier in the season, alongside for Toro Rosso.</p>
      <p>Haas enjoyed their best qualifying since the Spanish Grand Prix in May with <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Romain+Grosjean">Romain Grosjean</a> lining up seventh and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Kevin+Magnussen">Kevin Magnussen</a> ninth.</p>
      <p>After Leclerc’s demotion, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Kimi+Raikkonen">Kimi Raikkonen</a> qualified eighth for Alfa Romeo at the circuit where he won the 2007 world championship while McLaren’s British rookie Lando Norris rounded out the top 10.</p>
      <p>Norris’s Spanish team-mate <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Carlos+Sainz">Carlos Sainz</a> failed to set a time after an engine problem in the first phase of qualifying.</p>
      <p>“Something went, something on the engine,” he reported.</p>
