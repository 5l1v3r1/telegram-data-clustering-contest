      <p>Launching this week from our friends at Hyper, the <a href="http://bit.ly/2QcKbYx">latest HyperJuice product</a> is the world’s first and smallest 100W GaN USB-C charger on the market.</p>
      <p>Below we go hands-on with the new charger to give you an early look as the company this week begins taking preorders.</p>
      <p>About the size of a deck of cards, the new 100W charger is capable of quickly charging up to 4 devices at once via its 2 USB-C ports (supporting Power Delivery 3.0), and 2 x USB-A ports (supporting Quick Charge 3.0). That gives you everything you need to charge all of your MacBooks, iPads, iPhones &amp; other USB devices while on the go.</p>
      <p>To make it the perfect travel charger, Hyper is also including international adapters in the box. Head below for our video hands-on:</p>

      <p>Hyper is utilizing Gallium Nitride (GaN) technology to miniaturize components and make the new HyperJuice charger around 50% smaller than traditional chargers while offering even more power.</p>
      <p>Here’s a look next to Apple’s own MacBook charger:</p>

      <p>Not only does the new HyperJuice charger offer enough power at 100W to charge two 15″ MacBook Pros at fast speeds, it also can quick charge a MacBook Pro while, for example, simultaneously fast charging an iPad Pro, an iPhone, and a mobile device like your Apple Watch or AirPods.</p>
      <p>Other nice features for the new HyperJuice include built-in foldable wall plugs and those travel-friendly pin converters that work in any country as mentioned above.</p>
      <p>You can preorder the <a href="http://bit.ly/2QcKbYx">Hyper Juice 100W GaN USB-C Charger</a> 40% off retail price on Kickstarter now with first shipments starting January.</p>
