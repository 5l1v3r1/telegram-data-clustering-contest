      <p>Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) brushed off the impeachment testimony of David Holmes, an aide to former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor, on Saturday while on his way to the closed-door testimony of senior Office of Management and Budget official Mark Sandy.</p>
      <p><a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/sondland-trump-holmes-call-testimony">Holmes’ opening statement</a>, which CNN first reported Friday night, described to House investigators a July 26 phone call that he overheard between Ambassador Gordon Sondland and President Trump during which Trump brought up Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky doing the “investigation.”</p>
      <p>When asked about what he thought of Holmes’ testimony, Jordan dismissed the diplomat as “some guy who overheard a phone call.”</p>
      <p>“You got some guy who overheard a phone call, I’m sure he’s going to be a witness next week, we’ll have him in an open hearing, and will get a chance to question him there,” Jordan said.</p>
      <p>Pressed on whether he thinks that it was appropriate for Trump to follow up on the “investigation” he discussed with Sondland, Jordan once again dodged the question.</p>
      <p>“We’ll get a chance to question this guy, I’m sure the Democrats are going to bring him in, while — I’m betting they’re going to bring him in for a hearing, and we’ll get a chance to question him in the open,” Jordan said, before arguing that “we can’t even really talk about what he had to say because he didn’t release his transcript.”</p>
      <p>On Friday, Jordan predictably <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/jim-jordan-defends-trump-yovanovitch-tweets">defended</a> Trump’s tweets <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/trump-reaction-yovanovitch-public-testimony">bashing</a> ousted Ukraine ambassador Marie Yovanovitch in the midst of her public hearing.</p>
