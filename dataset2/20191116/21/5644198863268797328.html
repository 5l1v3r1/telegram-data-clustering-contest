      <p>Serie A club Inter Milan later said in a statement to Italian news agency Ansa that "the letter arrived at the club and not personally to the coach".</p>
      <p>"In relation to the news published today, Inter Milan states that Antonio Conte did not personally receive any threatening letters and, consequently, he did not go in person to file a complaint," the club statement said.</p>
      <p>"It was the club that received a letter and, as is the practice in this kind of situation, it contacted the competent authorities."</p>
      <p>An investigation has now been launched while Conte is receiving police surveillance outside his home and at Inter's training ground, Gazzetta Dello Sport reported.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Conte's wife Elisabetta Muscarello wrote on social media: "For the record: The story of the bullet is a hoax!"</p>
      <p>Conte joined Inter in the summer and the Italian outfit are currently one point behind his former club Juventus at the top of Serie A.</p>
      <p>The 50-year-old led Juventus to three consecutive Serie A titles from 2012 to 2014 before taking over as Italy national coach.</p>
      <p>He also spent two seasons at Chelsea, winning both the Premier League and the FA Cup during his time at Stamford Bridge.</p>
      <p>Conte took over from Luciano Spalletti, who led Inter to a fourth-place finish last season.</p>
