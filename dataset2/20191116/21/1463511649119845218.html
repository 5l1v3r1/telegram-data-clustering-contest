      <p>The Computer-Based Test Proprietors Association of Nigeria has lauded the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board for using biometric technology in the conduct of its examinations.</p>
      <p>The President of CPAN, Maxwell Akwuruoha, made the commendation at an event to mark CPAN’s first National Symposium in Abuja on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Akwuruoha said the technology had helped curb examination impersonations and double registration in national examinations.</p>
      <p>He said since 2011, the board was the first to use technology with the use of biometrics as a means of enrollment.</p>
      <p>According to him, the symposium is coming at a time when CBT proprietors around the country are compelled to get their centres ready for the 2020 academic year.</p>
      <p>He said: “We are having this symposium at a time where proprietors around the country are actually compelled to get their centres ready for the 2020 academic and business year.</p>
      <p>“My address on this discuss will be on using the National Identity Number to check impersonation on WAEC, NECO, NABTEB common entrance and JAMB exams.</p>
      <p>“JAMB has been the first and most effective body that has tried to use biometric enrolment as a means of identification in the exam environment.”</p>
      <p>Also, Chuks Onyepunuka, General Manager, Information Technology/Identity Database, National Identity Management Commission, noted that a robust system had been put in place to capture legal residence of Nigerians.</p>
      <p>Onyepunuka noted that the unique qualities in humans were the eye and the fingers, adding that it was the responsibility of NIMC to manage the identity of Nigerians.</p>
