      <h1>Trump undergoes part of his physical months ahead of schedule</h1>

      <p>The White House says President Trump underwent part of his <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-found-to-be-in-very-good-health-overall-white-house-doctor-says/">annual physical</a> at Walter Reed Medical Center on Saturday, a stop which came as a surprise to reporters as it was not on his public schedule. Mr. Trump was not due for <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/trump-wrote-letter-citing-clean-bill-of-health-former-doctor-claims/">another physical</a> until February. </p>
      <p>After the president arrived at Walter Reed, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham released a statement explaining that it was more convenient for the president to get parts of the physical out of the way before the new year.</p>
      <p>"Anticipating a very busy 2020, the President is taking advantage of a free weekend here in Washington, D.C., to begin portions of his routine annual physical exam at Walter Reed," Grisham said.</p>
      <p>"The president remains healthy and energetic without complaints, as demonstrated by his repeated vigorous rally performances in front of thousands of Americans several times a week," The White House said in a statement following Mr. Trump's examination.</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-gets-annual-physical-at-walter-reed/">February</a>, the president's four-hour physical found that his health is "very good" and was anticipated to remain so "for the duration of his presidency," according to White House physician Dr. Sean Conley.</p>
      <p>However, Mr. Trump had gained four pounds since his last physical, weighing in at 243 pounds. At 6'3", Mr. Trump has a body mass index of 30.4%, putting him just over the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/index.html">30-percent threshold that's considered obese</a> by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
