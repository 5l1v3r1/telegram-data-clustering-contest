      <h2>Tickets are being scalped for as much as $250</h2>

      <p>(CNN) - A small army of armchair entrepreneurs have taken to Craigslist and Twitter offering tickets to see Kanye West perform at Joel Osteen's Lakewood Church on Sunday for as much as $250 each.</p>
      <p>General admission tickets were posted on Ticketmaster on Saturday morning for free on behalf of the Houston church and were fully distributed within seven minutes, Don Iloff, spokesman for Lakewood, told CNN</p>
      <p>Since then, images of digital ticket offers have appeared on other sites for the 8 p.m. ET "<a href="https://www.lakewoodchurch.com/sundayservice">Sunday Service</a>" performance in Houston. The performance is "sold out," Iloff said.</p>
      <p>"This is something that happens with digital tickets. This is an issue we've been dealing with for years and years," Iloff said regarding the scalping of tickets. "It's our Easter services on steroids. Kanye has an audience in and outside of the Christian world."</p>
      <p>The resale fervor also struck Twitter, where people are offering <a href="https://twitter.com/taketimedoright/status/1195383970097246209">between $50</a> and $250 for a ticket. It is unclear whether the tickets are legitimate as online ticket scams run rampant.</p>
      <p>West released his ninth studio album, "Jesus Is King," on October 25. The Grammy Award-winning artist has promoted the album through a series of performances across the country, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib5065Gmoug">one at the Harris County Jail on Friday</a>.</p>
      <p>West's "Sunday Service" performances have included exuberant versions of hits like "Jesus Walks" and a handful of gospel songs, as was the case in <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/08/entertainment/kanye-west-sunday-service-chicago-trnd/index.html">Chicago in September.</a> An Instagram account titled <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kanyesundayservices/?utm_source=ig_embed">kanyesundayservices</a> features videos and photos from many of these events.</p>
      <p>Lakewood, which was once the Compaq Center sports arena, can hold 16,000 people for the performance, Iloff said.</p>
