      <h1>O'Mahony praises Munster effort but admits 'we’ve a lot to work on'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T21:01:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 21:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/simon-lewis/" target="_blank">By Simon Lewis</a></address>
      <p>Peter O'Mahony praised Munster’s effort in securing a bonus-point victory on the road in Wales but was annoyed by his side’s ill-discipline as <a href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/sport/other/munster-do-enough-to-secure-bonus-point-win-at-ospreys-964721.html?utm_source=recirc&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=recirc">the province secured a 32-13 win over Ospreys</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>A James Cronin try past 80 minutes at the Liberty Stadium capped the five-point win that gets Munster up and running in the new Heineken Champions Cup campaign, the loosehead prop replacement touching down at the bottom of a powerful driving maul to add to scores from man of the match Jeremy Loughman, and Ireland wings Keith Earls and Andrew Conway.</p>
      <p>Having dominated a struggling Ospreys side throughout with 78% possession in the first half, Munster’s lead was a relatively narrow 13-3 at the interval but Earls and Conway’s well-executed tries came in quick order around the 50-minute mark to all but secure victory.</p>
      <p>With a challenging Pool 4 schedule ahead, Racing 92 at home next Saturday and then Saracens home and away in December, the bonus-point try at the death was crucial with only the concession of 15 penalties detracting from the result in Swansea.</p>

      <p>“Parts were very good but we’ve a lot to work on,” Munster captain O’Mahony said.</p>
      <p>“I thought they played quite well, they put us under a lot of pressure in the first half. We got very little attacking platform – certainly lineout wise – it didn’t feel like we had a huge amount of platform.</p>
      <p>“I thought we defended quite well but one thing for me was the discipline – certainly away from home, it’s something we’d hang our hat on but we were ill-disciplined if anything. But our attack shape was good at times.”</p>
      <p>O’Mahony had spearheaded an excellent performance from the Munster forwards with Loughman also prominent in his first European start in place of the injured Dave Kilcoyne.</p>
      <p>The loosehead scored the opening try on 34 minutes and also provided a crucial pass in the build-up to Conway’s 52nd-minute score as Munster scored straight from the Ospreys restart following Earls’s try in the left-hand corner.</p>
      <p>All three tries were well constructed but it still needed that last-gasp effort, stemming from a ruck penalty won on halfway, and the driving maul from a five-metre lineout to secure the maximum return.</p>
      <p>It was put to O’Mahony that Munster enjoy doing things the hard way, to which he replied: “I certainly don’t enjoy it at the time, but they’re a very physical side and I think you saw from their maul attack it was very good. We found it difficult to stop.</p>
      <p>“I said to the lads inside: ‘you can never take for granted getting five points away from home in this competition’. It’s a difficult, difficult thing to do.”</p>
