      <p>Ryan Giggs is hopeful of starting Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey in Wales’ crucial Euro 2020 qualifier with Hungary after using both players in the win over Azerbaijan.</p>
      <p>Bale made his first appearance in a month on Saturday as Wales eased to a 2-0 victory in Baku that ensures their bid to qualify automatically for next year’s tournament will go down to the final game.</p>
      <p>The Real Madrid forward has been carrying a calf injury and lasted an hour before being replaced by Juventus midfielder Ramsey, who has also struggled for playing time of late due to a thigh problem.</p>
      <p>Giggs has yet to have both players on the pitch during qualifying but is optimistic of that changing against Hungary in Cardiff on Tuesday,</p>
      <p>“We’ve still got to assess them,” he said at his post-match news conference. “Getting Gareth off pretty early on and giving Aaron some minutes helped.</p>

      <p>“Aaron showed his quality when he came on, but it’s a quick turnaround. Gareth was blowing a little bit, which is understandable, but hopefully I’ll have the option of starting both on Tuesday.”</p>
      <p>Wales are now unbeaten in four Group E games since back-to-back away losses in June and are within a point of second-place Hungary, while Slovakia are a point behind ahead of their game in hand against Croatia later on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Victory for Wales against Hungary, coupled with Slovakia failing to take maximum points from their remaining two matches, would be enough for Giggs’ men to secure automatic qualification for Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>“We’ve had four good performances in a row, which we needed after the two difficult games in the summer,” Giggs said. “We needed to be strong and we have been.</p>
      <p>“I was not happy with the number of corners we gave away, but they never really troubled us in open play and we could have scored a few more goals.</p>

      <p>“Depending on the Croatia-Slovakia score, it sets us up nicely for Tuesday’s game.”</p>
      <p>Kieffer Moore doubled his goals tally in a Wales shirt with a 10th-minute opener at Bakcell Arena, while Harry Wilson was also on target in the first half of a comfortable away victory.</p>
      <p>It was Wales’ first away win since October 2018 and Giggs added: “Some of our play was outstanding.</p>
      <p>“Since the Azerbaijan game at home we’ve improved. We’ve played some difficult teams but overall the performances have improved.</p>
      <p>“We started to gain some sort of momentum, which isn’t easy in international football. The lads came into camp really confident. It doesn’t matter who’s come in, they’ve all contributed.</p>
      <p>“It’s not an easy place to come, so it’s up there with one of our best performances.”</p>
