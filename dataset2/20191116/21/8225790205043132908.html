      <p>HONOLULU, Hawaii (HawaiiNewsNow) -Honolulu police believe speed was a factor in an overnight crash that left a motorcyclist in critical condition.</p>
      <p>The crash took place around 12:05 a.m. Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>Police say a 64-year-old man was heading south on McCully Street when he attempted to turn left onto Citron.</p>
      <p>As he was turning, a 25-year-old motorcyclist heading north on McCully at a high rate of speed slammed into the man’s vehicle. The 25-year-old was ejected from the bike.</p>
      <p>HPD says the motorcyclist was not wearing a helmet at the time of the crash. He was taken to a hospital in critical condition.</p>
      <p>The man behind the wheel was not injured.</p>
      <p>“At this time, speed appears to be a contributing factor to this collision. It is unknown at this time if drugs or alcohol were contributing factors to this collision,” HPD said.</p>
