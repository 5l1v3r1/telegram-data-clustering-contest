      <p>Sunday Dare, the Minister of Youth and Sports Development, says the crisis rocking Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Ogbomoso in Oyo State is unfortunate but surmountable.</p>
      <p>Dare made the disclosure during a courtesy call on Prof. Michael Ologunde, the Vice-Chancellor of the institution, on Saturday in Ogbomoso.</p>
      <p>The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the institution co-owned by Oyo and Osun States had been battling with crisis over the ownership.</p>
      <p>Dare said the problem bedeviling the institution were surmountable, assuring them that the university would rise again.</p>
      <p>The Minister described the recent meeting of Governor Seyi Makinde and his Osun State counterpart, Gboyega Oyetola, in Abuja as apt.</p>
      <p>He said LAUTECH had consolidated on its leadership position as a University of Technology.</p>
      <p>Dare called on stakeholders to collectively work towards returning the institution to the period of uninterrupted academic activities.</p>
      <p>The Minister promised to play active role in finding lasting solution to the incessant closure of the university, which he described as a “model”.</p>
      <p>He said LAUTECH graduates were exceptionally good in their various chosen fields.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Ologunde lauded President Muhammadu Buhari on the appointment of Dare as a Minister, saying his choice was an indication that government truly believed in the youths.</p>
      <p>Ologunde admonished the minister to use his good office to help humanity and assist educational institutions as moulders of the nation’s future leaders to achieve their mandates.</p>
      <p>NAN reports that the minister later delivered the 13th annual lecture of the LAUTECH Alumni Association.</p>
