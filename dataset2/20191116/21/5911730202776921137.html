      <p>ORANGE COUNTY, Fla. --- An Orange County sheriff's deputy was arrested after a Lyft driver said he pointed a firearm at him Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>The arrest affidavit says Orlando police were dispatched to a call for an armed disturbance complaint.</p>
      <p>The Lyft driver said he picked up Deputy Troy Heyer, 45, and drove him to a nearby neighborhood. The driver said when he dropped off Heyer, he stayed outside for a few minutes to do a report on the Lyft app.</p>
      <p>It was stated that Heyer then came outside with a firearm and asked the driver, "what are you doing here?" The driver said he feared for his life.</p>
      <p>When officers arrived, they found Heyer and tried to talk to him. Heyer said he was not going to talk to officers and said "you're either going to arrest me or I'm going back in the house."</p>
      <p>Heyer was later arrested and charged with aggravated assault with a firearm. He was hired in October 2005.</p>
      <p>He has been relieved of all law enforcement duties without pay while the criminal case is underway.</p>
      <p>“These are very serious criminal allegations. As law enforcement officers, we must be held to the highest standards of conduct whether on duty or off duty,” said Sheriff John Mina. “These allegations will be thoroughly investigated and the results of that investigation will be made public.”</p>
