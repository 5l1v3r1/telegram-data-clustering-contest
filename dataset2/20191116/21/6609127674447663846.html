      <p>She revealed her agony after we told how a patient was said to have kicked and hit Wully, 69, over the head with a glass jug as he battled a chest bug in Hairmyres Hospital, East Kilbride, in October last year.</p>
      <p>He passed away in January. And last night Agnes, of Cambuslang, said: “My dad wasn’t himself after he was attacked.</p>
      <p>"He took constant panic attacks.</p>
      <p>"We’ve been told the man that attacked him might not face any more prosecution because my dad’s deceased. It’s devastating.”</p>
      <p>Police said: “A 54-year-old man was charged in connection with an assault.”</p>
      <p>A Crown Office spokesman added: “The procurator fiscal has received a report in relation to an alleged incident. It remains under consideration.”</p>
      <p>A hospital spokeswoman said: “Patient safety is paramount.”</p>
