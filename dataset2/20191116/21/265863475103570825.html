      <h1>Omarion Finally Addresses His Baby Mama Apryl Jones And Bandmate Lil Fizz Becoming A Couple: ‘I Don’t Feel Any Way About It’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T21:04:49+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 21:04</time> by <a rel="author">Ricki Mathers</a></address>
      <p>After Lil Fizz and Apryl Jones nearly broke the internet by making their relationship official, Omarion is finally speaking out about it. His response to the drama is pretty surprising to some while others have already declared that they want to be more like him.</p>
      <p>Omarion completed an interview with Vlad TV where he discussed things from earlier in his career to reuniting with B2K after so many years.</p>
      <p>It was inevitable that someone was going to bring up the relationship between his baby’s mother and bandmate.</p>
      <p>When asked how he feels, Omarion responded with a cool: ‘I don’t feel no ways. I don’t feel any way about it. If they’re happy, then they should be happy. I think they should change the narrative though.’</p>

      <p>He went to go on to say that Apryl is still the mother of his children and anything that affects her, affects him too.</p>
      <p>This comes after social media has been slamming the not-so-new couple for getting together. Omarion has been radio silent and living his best life amid the drama.</p>
      <p>People automatically started praising him for his mature response.</p>
      <p>One commentator wrote on the Shade Room’s post: ‘Everything doesn’t have to be handled publicly. You don’t have to react poorly to things that can’t disturb your peace. That’s called mastering emotional intelligence.’</p>
      <p>Someone else added: ‘Dear God, lead me to this type of peace.’</p>
      <p>‘Lord bless me with this type of maturity for the rest of my life in the face of adversity and in the idiocy of others, amen,’ prayed another.</p>
      <p>Someone else noted: ‘Omarion checked out of that relationship along time ago…he clearly don’t care lol’</p>
      <p>Apryl and Fizz have already made it known that they don’t care what the public thinks about their romance. Even more, they don’t care about what Moniece Slaughter thinks considering <a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/moniece-slaughter-calls-out-apryl-jones-for-dating-her-ex-boyfriends-bandmate-lil-fizz-298482/">she was the one who originally outed them</a>.</p>
