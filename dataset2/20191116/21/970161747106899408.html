      <p>Prince Andrew said he had taken daughter Beatrice to a Pizza Express party the day his accuser claims she was forced into having sex with him.</p>
      <p>The Duke of York has been grilled about his controversial friendship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein in a ‘no holds barred’ interview with Emily Maitlis on BBC’s Newsnight programme on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Andrew admitted he did not regret his relationship with the disgraced financier as it gave him the opportunity to meet people and help prepare for his role as a trade envoy.</p>
      <p>He said it was wrong to have stayed with Epstein and that he ‘let the side down’ but claims he had no idea ‘what was going on’.</p>
      <p>Epstein, 66, a convicted sex offender was found dead in a New York jail cell in August, while awaiting federal trial for sex trafficking.</p>

      <p>Virginia Roberts – now named Virginia Giuffre – is one of 16 women who says she was abused by Epstein and claimed she was forced to have sex with the prince three times between 2001 and 2002.</p>
      <p>Mrs Giuffre said she was trafficked when she was 17 and was forced into sexual encounters with the Duke in London, New York and on a private Caribbean island owned by Epstein.</p>

      <p>But the Duke claims he could not have had sex with her because he had taken his daughter to the pizza chain in Woking on the alleged date.</p>
      <p>‘On that particular day, that we now understand is the date which is the 10th of March, I was at home,’ the duke said.</p>

      <p>‘I was with the children and I’d taken Beatrice to a Pizza Express in Woking for a party at I suppose, sort of, four or five in the afternoon.</p>
      <p>‘And then because the duchess [of York] was away, we have a simple rule in the family that when one is away, the other one is there.’</p>
      <p>Speaking of the allegations Mrs Giuffre has claimed against him, the prince said he had ‘no recollection’ of ever meeting her.</p>
      <p>Ms Maitlis said Mrs Guiffre had been ‘very specific’ about Andrew that night, claiming he was ‘profusely sweating’ and that she went on to have a bath.</p>
      <p>But the duke said there was a ‘slight problem’ with that story – claiming he was unable to perspire at the time.</p>

      <p>‘I have a peculiar medical condition which is that I don’t sweat or I didn’t sweat at the time,’ Andrew claimed.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘…I didn’t sweat at the time because I had suffered what I would describe as an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands War when I was shot at and I simply… it was almost impossible for me to sweat.’</p>
      <p>He said it was only because he had ‘done a number of things in the recent past’ that he was able to sweat again.</p>
      <p>A photograph of the prince and Mrs Giuffre has been widely shared in the press inside what is said to be the house of British socialite and Epstein’s girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, in Belgravia, London.</p>
      <p>But Andrew told the BBC: ‘I have simply no recollection of the photograph ever being taken. I don’t remember ever going upstairs in the house’.</p>
      <p>Ms Maitlis pressed: ‘Your arm is around her waist’.</p>

      <p>The prince said he wasn’t ‘entirely convinced’ that his hand is around Mrs Giuffre’s waist in the photo but admitted ‘that is what I’d describe as me in the photograph’.</p>
      <p>Ms Maitlis continued: ‘Just to clarify, you think that photo has been faked?’</p>
      <p>He replied: ‘Nobody can prove that photo has been doctored… I don’t believe that photograph has been taken in the way that has been suggested’.</p>
      <p>The Duke said that as a member of the Royal Family, he is ‘not one to hug’ or ‘display affection’ in public, adding that he was at a ‘loss to explain’ how the image came to be and if the ‘original was to ever be produced’ he could clarify.</p>

      <p>Andrew stayed with Epstein at his home and the pair were photographed together in New York in Central Park after the businessman had been convicted for the prostitution of minors in 2010.</p>

      <p>But the Duke told the journalist that it would be ‘a considerable stretch’ to say he and Epstein were ‘very, very close’ friends.</p>
      <p>He claimed that it was in fact Epstein’s girlfriend, Ms Maxwell, who ‘was the key element in this’, as she was invited to Buckingham Palace in 2000 and that the financier was invited as a ‘plus one to some extent’.</p>
      <p>The Duke said he called off his friendship with Epstein in 2010 as he didn’t think it was ‘appropriate’ ‘because of what has happened’, following Epstein’s conviction in 2008.</p>
      <p>He said the whole episode had not been damaging to the Queen, only to himself, and that the wider royal family ‘couldn’t be more supportive’.</p>
