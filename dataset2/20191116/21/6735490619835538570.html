      <p>“Honestly, I don’t really talk about her very much because so much of her life is spent talking about me and I just think it’s sort of pathetic,” Kelsey said.</p>
      <p>Speaking to<a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/11/16/kim-richards-defends-camille-grammer-kelsey-diss-rhobh/"><i> Hollywood Life</i> </a>during BravoCon on Saturday, “Housewives” star Kim Richards said, “That’s terrible. Maybe there’s something we don’t know. I don’t know. But I feel bad if that’s happening because nobody wants to be — Nobody likes that. And I don’t think that’s fair.”</p>

      <p>“I don’t really like that guy,” Kim added. “I never liked what he did to her. I don’t know him personally. I met him and I liked him when I met him, but I think what he did to her was pretty s**tty but I don’t know their story.”</p>
      <p>Kelsey also accused Camille of asking for a divorce on the same day his mother died.</p>

      <p>“This is not true,” Camille responded on Twitter. “My parents were with us in the Hamptons when we received the news about his mom’s passing. We consoled him and flew back to LA to make arrangements for her funeral.”</p>
