      <h1>Savings for Jr golfers in DreamBig Gold Series Golf Camp</h1>

      <p>When the DreamBig Gold Series Golf Camp and Tournament opens at Orchard Golf and Country Club on Dec. 17 and 18, 2019, junior golfers living in the Philippines will not only be able to hone their talents and get the chance to be scouted by world-class coaches. They will also enjoy huge savings and other conveniences of having the golf camps travel to Manila instead of them going abroad to join them.</p>
      <p>Headlined as The Road To U.S. College Golf, the Dream Big golf camp will be preceded by the first-ever Future Champions Golf (FCG)-Dream Big Golf Challenger Series on December 16 and 17, a qualifier for the FCG Callaway World Championship. The winner of each age division in the Orchard tournament will qualify for direct entry to the FCG Callaway World Junior Golf Championship 2020 that will take place at Rancho Mirage, California on July 13 to 15, 2020.</p>

      <p>Golf Coaches from topmost schools in the US NCAA Division 1 – UCLA (University of California – Los Angeles), Columbia University and UC Berkeley – will run the two-day golf clinic and oversee the 2-day FCG Golf Tournament.</p>
      <p>Open to all junior golfers aged 12 to 18 years old, interested junior golfers and their parents have a choice of participating in both the tournament and the golf camp, or just one of the two activities.</p>
      <p>“Either way they will be getting a tremendous advantage if they choose to join the tournament and the camp in Manila. The cost of the trip, the tuition and the accommodations abroad is quite prohibitive for players who want to bring their game to a whole new level. But now, Golf Coaches from topmost schools in the US NCAA Division 1 – UCLA (University of California – Los Angeles), Columbia University and UC Berkeley – are coming and will run the two-day golf clinic here. The savings will be tremendous,” said Akshay Maliwal, Founder and CEO of DreamBig Events, who will stage the twin activities.</p>
      <p>Maliwal said participants will save over USD5000 by joining the camp in Manila and enjoy other advantages as well. The expenses abroad for camp tuition, airfare, board and lodging for athlete and chaperone, local transport expenses, and miscellaneous costs will add up to USD 5,900 and the athlete has to set aside seven days for travel and the camp itself.</p>
      <p>“In contrast, taking advantage of the Gold Series Golf Camp and Tournament in Manila will cost only USD 870 and will take out just three days from the athletes’ schedule. Airfare and travel costs are eliminated, as well as board and lodging. Over and above that, the Manila camp includes a qualifying tournament in the package – something that the camps abroad do not offer. With just one event, athletes have the opportunity to qualify for the Callaway Junior Tournament – the top tournament for junior golfers – and hone their skills at the camp as well. They have better access and opportunities to interact closely with the US coaches here; whereas interaction with coaches at similar camps in the US, is extremely limited,” Maliwal said.</p>
      <p>At the camp, campers will experience guided range and short game sessions that will allow them to sharpen their practice and pre-tournament routines. They will be given instruction that will help them expand their course management skills and prepare them for competition, as well as expose them to US coaching styles and competition at a higher level. The camp is limited to 30 participants only to enable personalized and customized instruction for each athlete.</p>
      <p>“This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for young golf talents in the Philippines to put their country in the world map of junior golf. We have worked hard to bring this camp to Asia and the Philippines in particular because we believe in the wealth of talents here,” Maliwal said.</p>
