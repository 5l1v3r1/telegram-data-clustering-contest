      <h1>Bitcoin Price at Last Line of Defense: $8,270 Must Hold</h1>

      <p>Late last month, Bitcoin (BTC) caught traders across the industry with their pants down: in a day’s time, the leading cryptocurrency had pumped by 42%, surging from $7,200 to $10,500 in a jaw-dropping, historical move higher. In fact, that day marked Bitcoin’s fourth-largest daily move… ever, and the largest price jump by percentage since 2011.</p>

      <p>Despite this surge higher, the crypto market has continued to bleed out. As of the time of writing this, the price of BTC has reached $8,535, trading a mere 1% or 2% up in the past 24 hours. Mild reprieve aside, an analyst has asserted that BTC has reached its “last line of defense,” which must hold, or disaster will ensue.</p>
      <p>Ouch.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin Price Must Hold $8,300</h3>
      <p>Analyst <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptodude999">CryptoDude recently noted</a> that Bitcoin’s chart shows that “bears absolutely undeniably have the upper-hand right now,” before adding that unless bulls pull something spectacular, “it will get really grim.” He then referenced the chart below, stating that if $8,270, which he dubbed the “last line of defense,” is lost, pain could follow.</p>

      <p>CryptoDude’s assertion that BTC is treading on very dangerous territory in the low-$8,000s is similar to that made by another popular trader, TraderX0. He pointed out in the tweet below, which was published on Saturday morning, that a close “below $8,300s won’t be good.” As he points out, $8,300 is a key support level in a descending channel that aligns with horizontal support.</p>

      <p>While BTC could bounce off $8,300, the ball may be in the court of bears. <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoCapo_/status/1194171127309967361">Capo of Crypto recently noted</a> that the aforementioned 42% jump, while bullish in and of itself, wasn’t a convincing sign that the bear trend has come to a head.</p>

      <p>He remarked that the jump to $10,500 validates a series of lower highs and lower lows, indicating a still-bearish trend. That’s not all, the Guppy/Fishnet Indicator is still printing gray bands, implying that the medium-term trend of Bitcoin is still undecided, and may actually be leaning bearish, not bullish.</p>
