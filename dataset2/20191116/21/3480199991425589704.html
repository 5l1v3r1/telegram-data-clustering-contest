      <p>US President Donald Trump is undergoing medical tests as part of what the White House said was his annual check-up.</p>
      <p>The appointment at Walter Reed National Medical Centre was not on Mr Trump’s weekend public schedule that was released on Friday night, and his last physical exam was in February.</p>
      <p>Press secretary Stephanie Grisham said the 73-year-old is “anticipating a very busy 2020” and wanted to take advantage of “a free weekend” in Washington to begin “portions of his routine” check-up.</p>
      <p>No details of what tests will be carried out were released.</p>
      <p>His check-up in February revealed he had put on weight and was officially considered obese, with a body mass index of 30.4.</p>

      <p>Mr Trump spent more than four hours at Walter Reed on February 8 for his most recent check-up, supervised by Dr Sean Conley and involving a panel of 11 specialists.</p>
      <p>At the time, White House staff said Mr Trump was in “very good health and I anticipate he will remain so for the duration of his presidency”.</p>
      <p>Test results which came out six days later showed he is obese under the commonly used BMI formula.</p>
      <p>About 40% of Americans are obese, which raises their risk of heart disease, diabetes, stroke and some forms of cancer.</p>
      <p>Mr Trump does not drink alcohol or smoke. His primary form of exercise is golf.</p>
      <p>His latest check-up comes as House investigators on Capitol Hill interviewed a White House budget official as part of the impeachment inquiry.</p>
