      <h1>George Conway under fire for sharing fake photo of GOP congresswoman and calling her 'lying trash'</h1>

      <p>Attorney George Conway, husband of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, issued scathing criticism of GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik and shared a fake photo of her after she claimed she was repeatedly interrupted during Friday's public impeachment hearing.</p>
      <p>George Conway, who has been a firebrand against his wife's employer, tweeted that Stefanik is "lying trash," including a call to action that asked for donations to the New York congresswoman's Democratic opponent Tedra Cobb.</p>
      <p>"@EliseStefanik is lying trash," he tweeted Saturday morning. "Please give to her opponent, @TedraCobb." He later <a href="https://twitter.com/gtconway3d/status/1195760852055531521">tweeted</a> an image of a receipt for his maximum donation of $2,800.</p>

      <p>On Friday, Stefanik asserted that she had been silenced during a House Intelligence Committee hearing of former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch by Chairman Adam Schiff, a point he argued was his constitutional right.</p>
      <p>"Once again, Adam Schiff flat out REFUSES to let duly elected Members of Congress ask questions to the witness, simply because we are Republicans," Stefanik tweeted. "His behavior is unacceptable and he continues to abuse his Chairmanship."</p>

      <p>Many people came to Stefanik's defense after seeing Conway's tweet, suggesting that his choice of language did not reflect the values he often criticizes the president of lacking.</p>
      <p>"I don't see how you can criticize the president for the gross why [sic] he attacks his opponents and then turn around and literally call your opponents trash," Washington Free Beacon reporter Stephen Gutowski said.</p>

      <p>"It is apparently not enough for this man, supposedly a respected lawyer, to dispute Stefanik’s claim of unfair treatment. No, he must denounce her as 'trash.' What does that say about him?" Fox News Senior Political Analyst Brit Hume said.</p>

      <p>Later, Conway shared what appeared to be doctored images of Stefanik with further critical messages about her performance.</p>
      <p>"In his ongoing quest to blindly attack @EliseStefanik, George Conway (@gtconway3d) happily shared what appears to be a photoshopped picture of her," <i>Washington Examiner </i>reporter Jerry Dunleavy said.</p>

      <p>Stefanik's communications director then pointed out details in the photo that proved it was fake, and Conway subsequently deleted them.</p>
      <p>"This picture is 100% FAKE," Communications Director Maddie Anderson said. "If you really need proof — look at all other pictures of the hearings, she wasn’t wearing that nail color (nor would she ever do this)."</p>

      <p>The congresswoman later responded to Conway's insult herself by saying, "And for you @gtconway3d - the one thing I’ve NEVER been called in my life is TRASH. You need serious help. My opponent Taxin’ Tedra can have your sick mysogynist [sic] support."</p>
