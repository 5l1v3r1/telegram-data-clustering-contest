      <h1>Ohio State Is Off To A Ridiculous Start vs. Rutgers Today</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T21:05:19+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 21:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>On Saturday afternoon, Ohio State and Rutgers took the field for what figured to be the most lopsided game of the college football season.</p>
      <p>Just a few minutes into the action, it’s clear why Las Vegas decided the Buckeyes should be 53-point favorites.</p>
      <p>Each of Rutgers’ first two possessions ended in a turnover and a subsequent Ohio State touchdown. The Buckeyes raced out to a 14-0 lead in the first three and a half minutes of the game.</p>
      <p>Things are not going well for the Scarlet Knights this afternoon.</p>

      <p>Rutgers quarterback Johnny Langan completed 3-of-6 passes for just 11 yards and an interception in the first two drives. He also leads the team in rushing with 21 yards on one scamper.</p>
      <p>Ohio State and Rutgers might want to agree to a running clock so this game doesn’t turn as ugly as it could.</p>
      <p>Stay tuned for the latest.</p>
