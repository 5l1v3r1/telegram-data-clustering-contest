      <h1>Scott Frost’s Message To Nebraska Fans After Loss vs. Wisconsin</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T21:30:47+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 21:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>Today got off to a good start for Scott Frost. Despite just eight wins through two seasons at Nebraska so far, he second-year head coach was given a contract extension.</p>
      <p>The new deal keeps Frost at Nebraska through 2026. Of course, given the team’s struggles, this was a surprising move, especially ahead of a big game against Big Ten West power Wisconsin.</p>
      <p>The game itself did not go so well for Frost. The Badgers ran for 320 total yards, with star running back Jonathan taylor going for 204 and two scores on 25 carries.</p>
      <p>The Huskers moved the ball quite effectively, out-gaining the Badgers 493-to-482, but couldn’t quite get over the hump today.</p>
      <p>Now, the team needs to beat Maryland and Iowa in back-to-back weeks to make a bowl. Scott Frost says he’s “<a href="https://thespun.com/big-ten/nebraska-cornhuskers/scott-frost-has-brutal-comment-after-loss-to-wisconsin">tired of looking for silver linings</a>,” but once again pledged to get the ship righted at his alma mater.</p>

      <p>There hasn’t been any real concern for Frost’s job, but the honeymoon phase is definitely over. Frost would probably be the first one to admit as much. The contract extension signals that he’s going to get a lot of time to figure this out, if nothing else.</p>
      <p>The Huskers are 8-14 under Frost, with a 5-11 Big Ten record. After he guided UCF to an undefeated season in his second year in Orlando, expectations were high entering this fall, but the Nebraska job was evidently a bigger rebuild than anticipated.</p>
