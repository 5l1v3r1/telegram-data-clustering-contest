        <b>A NATS MSP last night claimed a General Election win for Boris Johnson could see the food chain infiltrated by rat poo.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Emma Harper said a post-Brexit trade deal with US President Donald Trump would lead to rodent faeces and hair being “acceptable” in our grub if EU standards are dumped.</p>

      <p>Her alert came after MSPs heard different regulations in the States meant Britain might have to bow to American rules.</p>
      <p>Ms Harper said the US Food and Drug Administration allow “certain levels” of rodent poo, hair and insect parts in produce.</p>
      <p>The South Scotland MSP added: “It’s bad enough that Tories want to open the floodgates to US imports of chlorinated chicken.</p>
      <p>“But who knows what else we’ll be eating if Boris Johnson’s mob sink to this level. He must rule out any attempt to scrap standards protected by the EU.”</p>
      <p>Ms Harper told a Holyrood committee coco beans can legally contain “up to 10mg of poop a pound” in the US.</p>
      <p>She asked John Kerr, the Scottish Government’s head of agricultural policy, if a UK-US trade deal could lead to similar rules.</p>

      <p>Mr Kerr said: “If you accept the minimum standards another country is trading under, then your lowest quality produce may be at that standard.”</p>
      <p>But Tory MSP Adm Tomkins last night called the SNP attack “hysterical nonsense”.</p>
      <p>He said: “Continuing to trade with the EU means standards will stay in place, protecting food regulation.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Boris is to face <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4955128/boris-johnson-to-face-lord-buckethead-in-general-election-in-uxbridge/">Lord Buckethead in Uxbridge in the December General Election.</a></p>
      <p>The PM will also go up against a candidate called Count Binface in his West London constituency.</p>
      <p>Lord Buckethead has famously appeared alongside three former Prime Ministers in the past - most recently Theresa May in 2017.</p>
      <p>The fictional character also stood against Margaret Thatcher in 1989, and John Major in 1992.</p>
