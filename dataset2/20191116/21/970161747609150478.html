        <b>Dotty Cotton (Milly Zero) has wasted little time in winding up several of Walford’s finest in EastEnders since her return, and it would appear as if Martin Fowler (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/james-bye/">James Bye</a>) is the next on her list, as the young woman’s actions leave the fruit-and-veg stall holder less than pleased in the coming episodes, and he clashes with her as a result.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Martin has had an incredibly tough couple of months, what with him being at the beck and call of Ben (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/max-bowden/">Max Bowden</a>).</p>
      <p>Yes, as a result of the young man’s demands, he’s been forced to do all sorts, and as a result, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/28/eastenders-spoilers-stacey-fowler-devastated-as-martin-tells-her-their-marriage-is-over-in-an-attempt-to-keep-her-away-from-walford-10998044/">he lied to wife Stacey</a> (Lacey Turner) about having slept with Sonia (Natalie Cassidy) in order to keep her away from Albert Square.</p>

      <p>With all of that to contend with — not to mention getting over the fact that he was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/25/eastenders-spoilers-shocking-scenes-as-ben-mitchell-goes-to-extreme-lengths-to-get-revenge-on-martin-fowler-after-his-betrayal-10981669/">hung upside down from the railway bridge</a> — it’s safe to say Martin could do without stress right now, but he’s about to get quite a bit more courtesy of Dotty.</p>

      <p>In the coming episodes, Dotty is desperate for cash, and thus she comes up with a plan to make some money. However, Martin soon realises what she’s done — and he’s less than pleased, that’s for sure.</p>

      <p>As a result, he wastes little time in lashing out at her — and he delivers a few home truths in the process.</p>
      <p>Will Martin go too far?</p>
      <p>What’s more, what will Dotty have to say for herself?</p>
