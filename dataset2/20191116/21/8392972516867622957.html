      <p>Fans tuning into <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/x-factor/">The X Factor</a>: Celebrity tonight (Saturday November 16) have been left divided over Megan McKenna's performance.</p>
      <p>The former TOWIE star has been the runaway favourite week after week, performing beautiful self-penned songs and wowing both the public and the judges.</p>
      <p>But as she took to the stage to sing another ballad she had written herself, fans were left torn.</p>
      <p>While many insisted she was their winner, others felt it was a bit repetitive.</p>

      </p>
      <p>In fact, Nicole Scherzinger also agreed and said although the performance and vocals were stunning, she was hoping Megan would do something a bit more uptempo.</p>
      <p>Simon Cowell told her the performance was "as good as week one", but that he also wanted to see her more whacky side.</p>

      <p>In response, Megan said: "I can do uptempo, but I love to sing songs from my heart and put everything into it."</p>
      <p>Fans at home were in two minds. Some thought it was just too similar to previous weeks.</p>

      <p>Elsewhere,<a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/tv/x-factor-celebrity-fans-furious-with-new-format-of-the-show/"> fans accused Simon Cowell of 'making it up as he goes along'</a> as he changed the format of the show.</p>
      <p>The safe seats have been ditched after the show boss said the public didn't like them.</p>
      <p>And the star guest performer, Lizzo, took to the stage at the start of the show rather than halfway through.</p>

      <p>They were also furious with the first ad break coming just SIX minutes in, with many hitting out at the format overall.</p>
