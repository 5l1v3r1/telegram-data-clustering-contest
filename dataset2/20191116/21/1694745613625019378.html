      <h1>The 10 Actors You Always See in Hallmark Channel Movies</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T21:50:04+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 21:50</time> by <a rel="author">Amanda Prahl</a></address>
      <p>It's an honored tradition as old as time (or, at least, as old as cable networks): <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/family/Hallmark-Christmas-Movie-Drinking-Game-44261573">Hallmark holiday movies</a>. Unlike many other themed producers, though, the network doesn't limit its "holiday" programming to just Winter holidays — you can find movies about Thanksgiving, Valentine's Day, and <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Hallmark-Channel-Spring-Movies-2019-45889853">each of the four seasons</a>, plus a handful that are just classic cute rom-coms. No one can match Hallmark for sheer output: <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Hallmark-Christmas-Movies-2019-45995314">this holiday season alone</a> welcomes 22 new movies to the lineup, and that's not even including its "mysteries" channel!</p>
      <p>One thing you probably have noticed, though, is that Hallmark often reuses the same actors in several movies. If you've ever wondered who has the honor of starring in the most original movies, wonder no more! We've rounded up the 10 most prolific Hallmark actors and actresses, all leading up to the reveal of who the queen of the network really is!</p>
      <h3>Jessica Lowndes</h3>

      <p><b>Movie count:</b> 5</p>
      <p>For a Hallmark leading lady, Lowndes is only mid-tier, with "only" five movies under her belt. Several of her films have been big hits for the network, including <b>A December Bride</b> and <b>Merry Matrimony</b>. All but one of her movies have been Christmas-oriented, and the latest, <b>Christmas at Pemberley Manor</b>, premiered last holiday season.</p>
      <h3>Luke Macfarlane</h3>

      <p><b>Movie count:</b> 7</p>
      <p>Following a stage career and a series regular role on the ABC drama <b>Brothers and Sisters</b>, Macfarlane joined the Hallmark family. He's appeared in seven movies so far for the network. Macfarlane seems to specialize in Christmas movies: all but two (<b>A Birthday Wish</b> and <b>Just Add Romance</b>) of his films have been holiday-centric!</p>
      <h3>Alicia Witt</h3>

        <img src="https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/ONwZLlHYfxhVS-owPZK1UtFpTHo/fit-in/1024x1024/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2018/11/26/980/n/44498184/ef10e82f3a098818_TCDVEME_EC001/i/Alicia-Witt.jpg"/>

      <p><b>Movie count:</b> 7</p>
      <p>Witt is one of the longest-lasting leading ladies of the Hallmark movie club. Her first movie with the network came eight years ago, with 2010's <b>Backyard Wedding</b>. Although she hasn't churned out quite as many movies as some of the others — only seven so far — most of them have become fan favorites, especially 2013's <b>A Very Merry Mix-Up</b>.</p>
      <h3>Taylor Cole</h3>

      <p><b>Movie count:</b> 7</p>
      <p>Cole is probably one of the least recognizable names on this list. Unlike several other Hallmark stars, she didn't come to the network with a ready-made résumé, but became one of the network's go-to actresses nonetheless. Cole has racked up seven credits in just three years, starting with 2016's <b>Appetite For Love</b>. Her most recent credit is the baking-centric rom-com <b>Falling For You</b>.</p>
      <h3>Autumn Reeser</h3>

      <p><b>Movie count:</b> 8</p>
      <p>Fans of mid-2000s teen soaps will remember Reeser as <b>The O.C.</b>'s Taylor, but Hallmark fans know her as one of the channel's more prolific actresses. Reeser made her first Hallmark movie in 2012 with <b>Love at the Thanksgiving Day Parade</b> and has starred in seven more since then. She's had the distinction of starring in movies for nearly every event the channel celebrates: her Hallmark filmography includes movies based around Thanksgiving, Valentine's Day, Summer <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Wedding">wedding</a> season, and Christmas!</p>
      <h3>Brennan Elliott</h3>

      <p><b>Movie count:</b> 11</p>
      <p>Elliott has become one of Hallmark's most reliable leading men, with 11 films (including three on the "mysteries" subchannel) and a TV series on his résumé. He's best known for the <b>All of My Heart</b> trilogy, about a couple who inherit a house and turn it into an inn.</p>
      <h3>Danica McKellar</h3>

        <img src="https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/Kp82ZA9I4bF18yizAXWDXEB3Ua4/fit-in/1024x1024/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2018/11/26/980/n/44498184/10e909170cbf6fd3_TCDCOHO_EC014/i/Danica-McKellar.jpg"/>

      <p><b>Movie count:</b> 11</p>
      <p>McKellar has shifted from "former child star" to full-fledged Hallmark leading lady. Her résumé includes 11 Hallmark films, ranging from 2015 to today. The air date for her 12th movie, <b>Dollywood</b>, is Dec. 8, 2019!</p>
      <h3>Andrew Walker</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p><b>Movie count:</b> 12</p>
      <p>Among the men of Hallmark Channel's movies, Walker just might be the king of them all. He's been in a grand total of 12 so far and counting, ranging from holiday films to just-because midyear rom-coms, and 2017 was his most productive year since joining the channel's roster. In that year alone, he released four movies: <b>Love on Ice, The Perfect Catch, Love Struck Cafe, </b>and<b> Snowed-Inn Christmas.</b></p>
      <h3>Lacey Chabert</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/OUnBmRJjo1DEVmIr4ajVfHjaD7k/fit-in/1024x1024/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2018/11/26/980/n/44498184/d2d076b977710eea_TCDPRAN_EC018/i/Lacey-Chabert.jpg"/>

      <p><b>Movie count:</b> 17</p>
      <p>None for Gretchen Wieners, maybe, but plenty for Chabert, who is the undisputed queen of Hallmark movies. She's starred in a grand total of 17 of the channel's original movies, starting with 2010's <b>Elevator Girl</b>. <b>All of My Heart</b> from 2015 was so popular that it launched a series, whose third movie was released earlier in 2018. Most recently, she can be seen starring in <b>Love, Romance, &amp; Chocolate</b>.</p>
      <h3>Candace Cameron Bure</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/Z2RPv-ONL4sS5ZyCieFfpXFuE08/fit-in/1024x1024/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2018/11/26/980/n/44498184/b91645abb195a5f1_TCDCHUN_EC001/i/Candace-Cameron-Bure.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <p><b>Movie count:</b> 18</p>
      <p>If you feel like every time you turn on the Hallmark channel, Bure is on, there's a good reason for that. The <b>Full House</b> star has been in a whopping nine standalone Hallmark films, as well as the Aurora Teagarden series of mystery movies. She's made at least one per year since 2011 and been especially prolific in the past few years. Bure's contributions to the channel haven't just been limited to programming: she's also been credited as executive producer on over a dozen of her movies.</p>
