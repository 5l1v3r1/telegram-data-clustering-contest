      <h2>The decision for Nuneaton goalkeeper Tony Breeden to take the penalty was a surprise for some - and it is clear to see why given the end result</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T21:04:56+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 21:04</time> by <a rel="author">Aaron Flanagan, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/aaron-flanagan/</a></address>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/non-league-football">non-league</a> goalkeeper smashed the stadium's lights as he blazed a penalty over the bar.</p>
      <p>Nuneaton stopper Tony Breeden was tasked with putting his side in the lead with the scoreline goalless during Saturday afternoon's clash with Stratford Town.</p>
      <p>It was a surprise choice of penalty taker - and it looks even more baffling after the end result.</p>
      <p>Veteran goalkeeper Breeden, well known on the non-league circuit in the Midlands, fired his spot kick over the crossbar and into the stand full of Nuneaton's home supporters.</p>
      <p>But his shot was so powerful, it smashed one of the terracing lights.</p>

      <p>A long light fell from the roof and was lucky to avoid young fans who watched from behind the goal.</p>
      <p>It then dangled ominously as the game continued, with a steward guarding the damage until full-time.</p>
      <p>Thankfully for Breeden, his penalty miss was not costly, as Nuneaton ran out 2-0 winners, taking the lead four minutes after his fateful penalty.</p>
      <p>But he was not recalled for a second attempt later in the game as his side were awarded another penalty - with his own fans reportedly calling for him to stay back in his own goal.</p>
      <p>Breeden joined Nuneaton earlier this season from National League North side Leamington, from whom he was sacked.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old had his time at Leamington ended before after a pre-season altercation with team-mate Jack Edwards, who was left with a broken nose and was unable to play in the following game.</p>
      <p>“Officially left Leamington, not how I wanted to but down to my poor actions," Breeden posted on social media at the time.</p>
      <p>“Good luck in the future and sorry to fans, staff and players who I’ve (let) down.</p>
      <p>“I know you all held me in high regard &amp; the support I received literally weekly from you all made me feel so proud to represent your club. Good luck.”</p>
