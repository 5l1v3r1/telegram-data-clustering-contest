      <p>A whopping P3.15 million in prizes will be up for grabs in the 2019 Ambassador Eduardo M. Cojuangco Jr. Cup on Sunday at the Saddle and Clubs Leisure Park Racetrack in Naic, Cavite.</p>
      <p>Thirteen of the country’s best horses will be vying for the rich P1.8M top purse in the prestigious 2,000-meter race held in honor of the San Miguel Corp. Chairman, a stalwart in the horseracing industry.</p>
      <p>Leading the elite cast is defending champion Hitting Spree, which will try to make it three in a row in the annual Cojuangco Cup.</p>
      <p>Twelve other thoroughbreds, led by Hitting Spree’s stablemate and Triple Crown winner Sepfourteen (jockey JA Guce), will be crowding the reigning titlist for the top purse of P1.8 million in the rich racing weekend put up by the Philippine Racing Commission.</p>
      <p>“The big guns are all here, making the Ambassador Eduardo M. Cojuangco Jr. Cup truly one of the year’s biggest races in terms of prize money and star power. Racing enthusiasts will be in for a treat,” said Philracom Chairman Andrew A. Sanchez.</p>
      <p>Runner-up gets P675,000, while third-, fourth- and fifth-placers receive P375,000, P150,000 and P100,000, respectively.</p>
      <p>Ambassador Cojuangco himself has donated special championship trophies to the winners and a medallion to the champion jockey.</p>
      <p>Joining the fray are Bugle Notes (jockey JB Hernandez, owner Bell Racing Stable); Certain To Win (CP Henson, Bingson Tecson); Christmas Sky (Pat R Dilema, C&amp;H Enterprises, Inc.); Greatwall (FM Raquel, Jr., Robert Ramirez); Metamorphosis (CS Pare Jr., Francisco Paulo Crisostomo); Murika (RG Fernandez, Joseph Dyhengco); Super Sonic (JB Guce, Leonardo Javier, Jr.); Time and Again (Val R.
