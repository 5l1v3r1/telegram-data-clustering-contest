      <p>SEATTLE - Washington state officials are monitoring an oil spill at a refinery.</p>
      <p>The Seattle Times reports crews scrambled to contain the spill that happened late Friday at the Shell Puget Sound Refinery in Anacortes.</p>
      <p>It wasn't clear Saturday how much spilled when a barge was transferring about 5 million gallons of crude oil from Alaska to the refinery. Washington State Department of Ecology spokesman Ty Keltner says it appears a much smaller quantity spilled.</p>
      <p>Keltner says an inspector will be assessing why the spill occurred. Workers will be looking for any oiled wildlife.</p>
      <p>The spill was at the end of a long pier extending into Fidalgo Bay.</p>
      <p>Shell says crews spotted oil coming from the barge and identified the source as a pressure-relief valve. The valve was secured, stopping the spill.</p>
