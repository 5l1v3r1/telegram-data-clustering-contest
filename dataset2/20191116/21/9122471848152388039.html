      <h1>Hue Jackson Reportedly Decides To Leave Colin Kaepernick Workout</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T21:15:57+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 21:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>Shortly after Adam Schefter announced that Colin Kaepernick’s <a href="https://thespun.com/more/top-stories/colin-kaepernick-workout-being-moved-location">workout would be moved</a>, former head coach Hue Jackson decided that he will no longer run the show this afternoon.</p>
      <p>Kaepernick was asking for transparency from the NFL and everyone who covers the workout, which resulted in the location being changed to an alternative facility in Atlanta. That isn’t the only major announcement involving this workout.</p>
      <p>It was being reported throughout the week that Jackson would lead the workout for Kaepernick.</p>
      <p>According to NFL Network reporter Michael Silver, the workout will no longer be run by Jackson. Once he learned that Kaepernick’s team wanted the location changed, he backed out of his original position.</p>

      <p>Obviously the timing of this news isn’t ideal for Kaepernick.</p>
      <p>There’s no specifics as to why Jackson isn’t running the workout any longer. However, it does have many analysts and fans speculating about what will happen next.</p>

      <p>It’s uncertain as of now if the NFL has a backup plan for this specific situation. Joe Philbin was rumored to assist Jackson during all of this, but there hasn’t been an update on his status.</p>
      <p>Kaepernick’s workout is scheduled to take place right now in Atlanta. We should have more details available in the near future.</p>
