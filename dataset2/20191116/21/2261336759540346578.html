      <p><i>Olá!</i> It’s fight day for UFC Sao Paulo, which kicks off tonight from the Ibirapuera Gymnasium in Brazil. Bloody Elbow is back to bring you the betting odds!</p>
      <p>The event’s featured matchup involves MMA great Ronaldo “Jacare” Souza moving up to light heavyweight to collide with the #6 ranked Polish powerhouse, Jan Blachowicz. The oddsmakers like them some Jan here, setting his straight up moneyline around the -170 mark. That leaves Jacare in the underdog slot, clocking in at a value of +160.</p>

      <p>The over/under for this 205-pound main event has been set at 2.5 rounds. Bettors can lay the price on the ‘Under’ for -122, or take the price on the ‘Over’ for +107. The bookies do not believe that this bout will be going the distance. The prop bet ‘Fight doesn’t go to decision’ is available with a heavily favored moneyline of -265. Going back the other way, the proposition ‘Fight goes to decision’ is currently sitting as a +205 underdog.</p>
      <p>The UFC Sao Paulo co-main event will be graced by MMA legend Mauricio “Shogun” Rua, who is also miraculously the promotion’s #14 ranked light heavyweight. He will be locking horns with the unranked, yet submission-savvy, Paul Craig. Despite all of the mileage on the super-seasoned veteran, Shogun is quite favored here with a moneyline of -280. His inconsistent opposition in Craig is on the table as a +255 underdog.</p>
      <p>The over/under for the UFC Sao Paulo co-main event has been set at 1.5 rounds. The ‘Over’ owns a favored line of -127, with the ‘Under’ trekking at +112. The bet-setters are expecting this 205-pound tilt to end early. The exotic bet ‘Fight doesn’t go to decision’ is moderately favored at -335, with ‘Fight goes to decision’ as an underdog option at +255.</p>
      <p>If this bout will be ending early, then which fighter will be the one to find the finish? Well, the oddsmakers suggest that it will be Shogun to get it done early. ‘Rua wins inside distance’ comes with a favored price tag of -130, with ‘Not Rua inside distance’ resting at +110. By comparison, ‘Craig wins inside distance’ is a bulky underdog prop at +360, with ‘Not Craig inside distance’ massively favored at -495.</p>
