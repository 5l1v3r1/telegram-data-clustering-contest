      <h1>The New Charlie's Angels Movie Includes Not One, Not Two, but THREE Bosleys</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T21:50:04+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 21:50</time> by <a rel="author">Quinn Keaney</a></address>
      <p>Back in 2018, POPSUGAR <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Charlie-Angels-Reboot-Interviews-2019-46316874">visited the <b>Charlie's Angels</b> set in Berlin</a> to get a sense of what to expect from <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Charlie-Angels-2019-Trailer-46317820">the modern-day take</a> on the classic franchise. Spoiler alert: we learned <i>a lot</i>.</p>
      <p>While most of the elements of the original <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Charlie%E2%80%99s-Angels"><b>Charlie's Angels</b></a> formula are still present — three highly trained and intelligent women kicking a lot of ass — director Elizabeth Banks made sure to update some things. First and foremost is the fact that it's a whole new world for the character previously known as Bosley. While previous squads of Angels have been trained and mentored by men who go by the name John Bosley, the surname has now been transformed into a position at the Townsend Agency where the Angels work. Now, anyone can be a Bosley — including the Angels themselves.</p>
      <p>"There are multiple Bosleys who oversee different territories or headquarters," producer Max Handelman explained while POPSUGAR was on set. "So you're having Bosleys kind of also moving around the world with their own teams." Who will be playing Bosley? Banks is pulling double duty being both behind and in front of the camera, as she's serving as the main Bosley the Angels — played by <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Kristen-Stewart">Kristen Stewart</a>, Naomi Scott, and Ella Balinska — come in contact with. But she isn't the only Bosley around. In fact, she's one of three. Find out who else will hold the Bosley title ahead!</p>

      <p>Banks's character is the first Angel who became a Bosley, which the producers see as a fitting metaphor for how women's careers evolve in real life. "So, without being super on the nose and not being heavy handed about it, that's a way to talk about women's equality through the workplace," Handelman said. "Once you're done being an Angel, you're not just done."</p>
      <h3>Djimon Hounsou</h3>

      <p>In the trailer, Hounsou's Bosley pops up a few times in scenes that make it seem like he'll be particularly skilled in combat (both in training the Angels and doing it himself).</p>
      <h3>Patrick Stewart</h3>

      <p>According to Handelman, Stewart's Bosley is "kind of the patriarch of the organization," who worked alongside Charlie to build the agency. He didn't elaborate on Stewart's role, but we can't help but wonder if that means he's the original Bosley.</p>
