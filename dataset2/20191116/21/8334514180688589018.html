      <p>(Reuters) - Russell Henley incurred a bizarre eight-stroke penalty in the second round at the Mayakoba Classic on Saturday after realizing that one of the balls he had played was different from the rest.</p>
      <p>The three-times PGA Tour winner was signing balls for fans when he noticed the discrepancy and received a two-stroke penalty for each of the holes he played the different ball.</p>
      <p>“(Henley) suffered a 2-stroke penalty on holes 9-12, 8 strokes in total, for breach of Rule 20-3,” the PGA Tour announced in a tweet.</p>
      <p>“As Henley signed balls for fans he noticed one ball had a slight difference from the ball he uses. He didn’t know how it got in his bag.”</p>
      <p>Under the “One Ball Rule” used on most professional tours, golfers must use the same brand and make of ball throughout a round.</p>
      <p>With the eight strokes added, Henley shot a six-over-par 77 and missed the cut.</p>
      <p>He carded 66 in the opening round and without the penalty would have been within striking distance of the lead.</p>
