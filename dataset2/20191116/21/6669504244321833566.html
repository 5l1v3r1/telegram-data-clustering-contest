      <p>It has been a whirlwind of a morning for Jennifer West.</p>
      <p>At 4 a.m. Saturday, West received a call from the Kelowna RCMP saying that a vehicle had crashed into her business, Bean Scene Coffee Works North on Ellis Street at around 1:30 a.m.</p>
      <p>"It was a little bit nerve-wracking getting woken up by police at 4 a.m. We weren't sure what to expect when police called," West said. "It was kind of a bit overwhelming."</p>
      <p>Fast forward a few hours and the windows and door smashed by the vehicle have been boarded up and the coffee shop is open for business.</p>
      <p>"It (the vehicle) didn't get all the way in or anything. It smashed the door and the windows," West said.</p>
      <p>Insurance companies have been called and West is certain that the damages will be covered.</p>
      <p>"Everyone has been just so amazing helping us put it back."</p>
      <p>West did not know whether or not an arrest had been made.</p>
