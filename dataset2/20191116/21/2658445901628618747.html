      <h4>Agency Reporter</h4>
      <p>The Federal Road Safety Corps and the Department of State Services have tracked down the producers of fake number plates in the country.</p>
      <p>The Corps Public Education Officer, Mr Bisi Kazeem, disclosed this in a statement made available to News Agency of Nigeria on Saturday in Abuja.</p>
      <p>NAN reports that the Corps Marshal, FRSC, Dr Boboye Oyeyemi, had ordered an investigation into a particular plate number in Kano.</p>
      <p>NAN reports that the number plate has the inscription of “Chip Whip” purportedly for a member of the Kano state House of Assembly.</p>
      <p>Kazeem said that both agencies have apprehended some syndicates in Kano and Kebbi States in connection with the production of illegal number plates including the fake Kano ‘Chip Whip’ number plate.</p>
      <p>According to Kazeem, upon sighting the illegal number plate, the Corps Marshal, Dr Boboye Oyeyemi immediately directed the Kano state Sector Commander, Mr Zubairu Mato, to collaborate with security agencies to fish out the syndicates involved in producing fake number plates in the state.</p>
      <p>“Consequent upon the directive, DSS Kano State was intimated and immediately swung into action to arrest the perpetrators and bring them to book.</p>
      <p>“On Tuesday 12th November 2019, DSS raided the following areas in Kano State; Sabon Gari, Kofar Ruwa, Gidan Boss (Kofar Mazugal) Kofar Wambai (Yan Robobi) and Naibawa Zaria road.</p>
      <p>“At Sabon Gari, a suspect was arrested and subsequently charged to court for the production of fake number plates.</p>

      <p>“The suspect was apprehended while digging the ground to hide the illegal number plates in his possession to evade arrest,” he said.</p>
      <p>Kazeem noted that in a similar operation, the Corps arrested some syndicates at the Dodaru market, Gwandu Local Government Area of Kebbi State who specialised in selling illegal number plates to motorcyclists.</p>
      <p>“The suspects were arraigned on Friday before the Chief Magistrate Court 1 Birnin Kebbi. The accused pleaded not guilty but were remanded in prison custody by the Chief Magistrate till 28 November 2019 when the case will be represented for hearing.</p>
      <p>“The Corps Marshal who expressed satisfaction with the fruitful synergy among the agencies thanked the Director General of DSS, Mr Yusuf Bichi, for the prompt professional response deployed to arrest the suspects.</p>
      <p>“He, therefore, called on all Nigerians who have vital information about any individual involved in the illegal act to provide such to the Corps for necessary actions.”</p>
