      <p><b>SMITHFIELD, R.I.Â (AP)</b> - David Onyemem intercepted a pass just outside the red zone in the closing seconds and Bryant held on to upset Duquesne 20-16 on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Duquesne, the defending Northeast Conference champion, blocked a field goal with 2:10 left and marched to the Bryant 25. A 14-yard completion put the ball at the 25 but an unsportsmanlike penalty pushed it back to the 40 and on second down Onyemen picked off Brett Brumbaugh.</p>
      <p>Bryant (3-8, 2-4) is the only NEC team with a winning record against Duquesne, winning six of the last seven.</p>
      <p>The Bulldogs surprised Duquesne in the second quarter after taking a 6-3 lead on a 50-yard Luke Samperi field goal. An onside kick set Bryant up on the Dukes' 46 and on the second snap Hunter Hill went 39 yards for a touchdown and 12-3 lead. On the third snap of the second half, Andrew Brackett returned an interception 50 yards to the Duquesne 3 and two runs later, Daniel Adeboboye got into the end zone.</p>
      <p>Duquesne had a 370-216 edge in offensive yards, a 27-11 advantage in first downs, and held the ball 16 more minutes, but had to settle for three field goals.</p>
      <p>Robert Brown had 17 tackles for Bryant to surpass 200 for his career. Jesse Nenerowicz, who became the first Bulldog with 300 tackles last week, had 13.</p>
