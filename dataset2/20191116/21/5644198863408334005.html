      <p>BEIRUT: A majestic phoenix spreads its wings as Hayat Nazer adds a splash of colour to a Beirut wall. As Lebanon's uprising enters its second month, graffiti has enveloped the capital's posh downtown.</p>
      <p>Since Oct 17, the chanting of tens of thousands of Lebanese denouncing the political elite have shaken the normally staid district around two Beirut squares - Martyrs' and Riad Al Solh.</p>

      <p>Nazer, a 32-year-old artist, is one of the protesters who would not normally frequent the area, famed for luxury boutiques and elegant buildings. But the unprecedented protests also offered her a first experience with street art.</p>
      <p>"I decided to go out in the street to be inspired by the people," she said during a cigarette break, standing next to pots of red, green and yellow paint.</p>

      <p>Then she turned to place the final brushstroke on the mythical bird emerging from a burning forest -Â a reference to the fires that ravaged Lebanon's mountains shortly before the protests began.</p>
      <p>"The phoenix reminds us that the Lebanese shouldn't lose hope. When we fall, we need to rise up and fly to freedom, to claim our rights," she said.</p>
      <p>
        <b>"ICON OF CAPITALISM"</b>
      </p>
      <p>The long concrete barrier Nazer was painting protects a United Nations building, but has been named the "wall of the revolution" for the graffiti adorning it.</p>
      <p>A ballerina pirouettes under shells, accompanied by the slogan "Rise up". Further down, a big purple hand flashes a V for victory.</p>
      <p>On nearby buildings, various causes are championed with spray-painted and stencilled slogans: "Our revolution is feminist"; "LGBT rights, love is not a crime"; and "We will burn your palaces".</p>
      <p>Political leaders are lampooned in caricature, including outgoing Prime Minister Saad Hariri, longstanding parliament speaker Nabih Berri, and central bank governor Riad Salameh.</p>
      <p>The contrast is striking compared with the nearby opulence of a district that was controversially rebuilt after being ravaged during the 1975-1990 civil war.</p>
      <p>Today a Rolex clock tower stands in front of a parliament cordoned off by security forces. Working-class souks have been replaced by a modern commercial centre, home to banks and French luxury brands.</p>
      <p>The reconstruction of the district, famed for its stone buildings in neo-Venetian and neo-Moorish style, was led by Solidere, the real estate company of billionaire former prime minister Rafiq Hariri.</p>
      <p>Its detractors say the project killed the soul of a formerly vibrant neighourhood in order to attract Gulf investment and wealthy tourists.</p>
      <p>"This city has become an icon of capitalism," said artist and rights activist Selim Mawad.</p>
      <p>He jumped onto a plastic barricade to retouch a mural of stylised bulls alongside the slogan: "What is the future of our revolution?"</p>

        <b>"PERSONAL LIBERATION"</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lebanon's uprising - like protests elsewhere in the Middle East and Latin America - is both political and social.</p>
      <p>"It's also about personal liberation, which is the foundation of a revolution," Mawad said.</p>
      <p>He sees symbolism in graffiti.</p>
      <p>"People say, 'I can't touch this building, I can't live there, so I'll leave my mark on it'," the paint-spattered artist told AFP.</p>
      <p>One day, assailants attacked the protesters in the area where Mawad was painting his mural. He was beaten and his bicycle stolen.</p>
      <p>"Give back the stolen money - and don't forget the bike," he later painted next to a picture of a bull brandishing a red bicycle.</p>
      <p>He hopes the paintings will be preserved. "It's the memory of an uprising. If they erase them, we will forget."</p>
      <p>Nearby, Rida Mawla left a meeting and decided to take a walk in the city centre, something he said he never previously did.</p>
      <p>"I'm starting to feel like downtown is a bit more like me," the business consultant said.</p>
      <p>"In theory it's the place where everyone should meet, but the ruling class has taken possession of it," he said.</p>
      <p>He pointed out his favourite graffiti, a big black tag scrawled on a wall: "Beirut has spoken".</p>
