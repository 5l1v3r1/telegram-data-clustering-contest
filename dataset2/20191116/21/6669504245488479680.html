      <p>VANCOUVER - A Vancouver police officer has been charged with sexual assault after an alleged incident in Whistler, B.C., this past summer.</p>
      <p>Police say 51-year-old Jagraj Berar, also known as Roger Berar, of Surrey has been charged following an investigation.</p>
      <p>Mounties say they believe the incident was isolated, unrelated to Berar's employment as a police officer, and involved persons known to each other.</p>
      <p>Vancouver police Sgt. Steve Addison confirmed Berar is still with the department, but says the officer is not on active duty.</p>
      <p>Squamish RCMP say they believe the alleged assault occurred a few days before the detachment received a complaint on July 19.</p>
