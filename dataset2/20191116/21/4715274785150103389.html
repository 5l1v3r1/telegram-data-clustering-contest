      <p>The National University Pep Squad seeks its second straight title as the UAAP Season 82 Cheerdance Competition gets going on Sunday at the SM Mall of Asia Arena.</p>
      <p>NU Pep won five championships in the last six years as the Bustillos-based cheerdancers hope to wow everyone with a performance that coach Ghicka Bernabe said is a tribute to all the Filipinos.</p>
      <p>In front of its flag-waving schoolmates, NU Pep Squad is ready to deliver with its Sarimanok-inspired run in the mat.</p>
      <p>NU Pep will be the eighth and last performer which was determined in the lottery two months ago, the first since the 2014 edition, where they won back-to-back titles.</p>
      <p>“Eight is better than one pagdating sa performance. Somehow nu’ng na-experience namin as first performers before, kahit gaano kami kahanda, I can’t control the emotions of my kids, I can’t control yung scenario,” said NU Pep head coach Ghicka Bernabe.</p>
      <p>Last season’s runner-up Far Eastern University Cheering Squad will be the fifth performer, hoping to deliver with a Michael Jackson-inspired run.</p>
      <p>Adamson University Pep Squad, which placed third last year, will be at No. 6, seeking to bore fruit its bid to regain the throne it won two years ago.</p>
      <p>De La Salle Animo Squad will perform first, followed by University of the East Pep Squad, University of the Philippines Pep Squad and Ateneo Blue Babble Battalion.</p>
      <p>University of Santo Tomas Salinggawi Dance Troupe will be the penultimate performer before NU.</p>
      <p>Gates open at 12 noon.</p>
