      <p>China’s People’s Liberation Army soldiers made a surprise appearance in some Hong Kong streets on Saturday, helping to clean up debris and barricades left by anti-government protesters.</p>
      <p>Small groups of demonstrators who remained nearby harassed the soldiers, who, wearing shorts and T-shirts, labored alongside city workers and residents to pick up bricks and other debris, The Associated Press reported.</p>
      <p>The city, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/13/hong-kong-protesters-fire-arrows-javelins-and-tear-gas-against-armed-riot-police/">rocked by increasingly violent protests</a> for five months, had a relatively quiet Saturday, though demonstrators kept a major cross-harbor tunnel blocked. The calm followed some of the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/13/police-official-warns-hong-kong-is-on-brink-of-a-total-breakdown/">worst violence of the year</a>, including <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/11/hong-kong-cop-shoots-student-man-set-ablaze-as-chaos-continues/">a cop shooting a student on Monday</a>.</p>
      <p>The presence of the soldiers could enrage protesters even more, Reuters reported. The movement was sparked by a proposed law that would have made extradition to the mainland easier, and has since morphed into anger over perceived Chinese meddling in the semi-autonomous city.</p>
