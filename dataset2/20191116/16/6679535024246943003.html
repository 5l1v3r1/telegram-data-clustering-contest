      <h1>Sarovar dam-hit fishermen grapple with altering breeding patterns</h1>
      <h2>Catch has dwindled with a slower water current and pollution from pesticides and garbage.</h2>

      <p>Ever since the Sardar Sarovar dam downstream was filled to the brim, the Narmada has developed an erratic current and an unstable course, posing a challenge to fishermen in Madhya Pradesh.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, hundreds of farmers, potters and fishermen marched to the office of the Narmada Valley Development Authority here and demanded rehabilitation and alternative employment.</p>
      <p>“When the backwaters swelled, the catch dwindled dramatically. And now, several species have become extinct in the river,” says Mansarovar Verma, 53, a fisherman of Chikhalda village in Barwani district.</p>
      <p>Sharing a similar fate with those from 178 villages that submerged under the backwaters, Mr. Verma and hundreds of farmers, potters and fishermen marched to the office of the Narmada Valley Development Authority here on Saturday and demanded rehabilitation and alternative employment.</p>
      <p>“We don’t want contractors from outside to take over waterbodies. Local fishermen have a traditional right to them,” says Medha Patkar of the Narmada Bachao Andolan, who led the rally and then staged a dharna with protesters.</p>
      <p>After the dam was filled up to 138.68 metres on September 17 for the first time, breeding patterns of the fish have altered. “Water has entered forests, and dead leaves are detrimental to fish. Furthermore, garbage from submerged villages has caused a large-scale pollution of the river,” says Mr. Verma.</p>
      <p>The government has opened 32 societies for fishermen in Dhar, Barwani and Khargone districts, which share the river’s banks, to dispel the fears about contractors taking over fishing and to confer rights on them.</p>
      <p>The new backwater level, after the dam was filled up to 138.68 metres on September 17 for the first time, has altered the breeding patterns of fish, says Mr. Verma, who belongs to the Kahar community of traditional fishermen. “Water has entered forests, and dead leaves are detrimental to fish. Furthermore, garbage from submerged villages has caused a large-scale pollution of the river,” he says. “With thousands of acres of agricultural fields submerged, pesticides have contaminated the breeding spots. And identifying new ones, across such a huge river, is difficult.”</p>
      <p>So is casting the net underwater and pulling it back, given the increased depth. “As water has entered settlements and forests, boats and equipment often get stuck.”</p>
      <p>Now Mr. Verma catches 2 kg-4 kg of fish a day, earning up to ₹400; three months ago, he netted 8kg-10 kg, bringing home ₹1,000 a day. “We have been fishing for generations, and our own masters. We want compensation or land for the loss incurred. We don’t want to work for a fishing contractor, who’ll set terms for us,” he says.</p>
      <p>“My grandfather often said a day’s catch could ensure eight days of meals, as we used to barter fish for grains with farmers,” says Jitendra Kahar, 29, of Bijasan in Barwani district. “Now, that system has collapsed.”</p>
      <p>A river so vast and voluminous now has another peril for the community. “Even a small wave can easily overturn our artisan fishing boats, which can carry just two-three persons,” he says.</p>
      <p>Several species, including ‘mahseer’, has gone extinct. “Water is stagnant, or the current has slowed because of the dam. Fish lay eggs only in flowing waters,” Mr. Kahar explains.</p>
      <p>Until recently, the drop in the water level after the monsoon gave them an opportunity to cultivate musk melons and watermelons around January on the river banks. “Sandy soil, with pebbles, is fit for their cultivation. After the water level rose, this became impossible. The fruits from this region were popular in Indore,” says Mr. Kahar.</p>
      <p>Each year, the fishermen paid a fine to the local authority for using the banks for the cultivation. While Mr. Kahar’s grandfather paid ₹22 an acre in 1956, Mr. Verma paid ₹250 in 1992. “We could save ₹1 lakh-₹1.5 lakh from this alternative occupation. We practised it until 2015,” says Mr. Verma.</p>
