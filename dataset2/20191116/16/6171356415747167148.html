      <p>It's known that one of the biggest draws of a VPN is the fact that you gain security when using the service. So it's important to note that CyberGhost VPN keeps zero logs, and since the company's headquarters is located in Romania, it's under no obligation to keep user data. AES-256 encryption is used to ensure a secure connection while using the VPN, and there's even a kill switch available to all users if your connection happens to drop when using a public connection. It's also worth mentioning that DNS requests won't ever leak to your ISP, and unlimited bandwidth is included with the service, which means you won't ever have to worry about throttling.</p>
