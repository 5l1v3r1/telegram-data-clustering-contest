      <h1>Happy times for Kerry Lee at Cheltenham as Diva strikes Gold</h1>

        <b>Happy Diva made up for being brought down in the same race last year by winning the BetVictor Gold Cup at Cheltenham for Kerry Lee.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The mare was travelling well when brought down four out last year but she didn't suffer such misfortune this time around under Richard Patrick.</p>
      <p>As the field dropped away one by one in testing conditions, Happy Diva travelled strongly into contention and jumped the last well to put herself in pole position.</p>
      <p>Brelan D'As and Slate House emerged as major threats at the last, though, and while the latter fell when in contention the former laid down a stern challenge.</p>
      <p>However, Happy Diva wasn't for passing up the hill and she held on to win by a neck from Brelan D'As.</p>
      <p>There were eight lengths back to long-time front-runner Warthog in third, with Belami Des Pictons fourth.</p>
      <p>Magic Saint and Count Merible were fifth and sixth.</p>

      <p>Lee said: "They are the most fantastic, loyal owners (Will Roseff and family) and it means so much to come and win on the big day for them. When they have a good day, they celebrate and when they have a bad one, they say there is always another one.</p>
      <p>"Richard has ridden her through her entire chase career and he rides her a home at lot. Jordan Devlin has done all the work on her and we knew she would come on for Wetherby, but we didn't think she would come on quite this much.</p>
      <p>"With a circuit to go, I thought Richard had her absolutely perfectly positioned and I couldn't have been happier to be honest.</p>
      <p>"You don't get too carried away with a horse like that as you know what is round the corner sometimes.</p>
      <p>"Richard has been with me three years now. He came on as a conditional and he is a very good, balanced rider and he is excellent on the big stage. Nerves don't matter to him, unlike me.</p>
      <p>"We got done in the Grand Annual by a horse owned by Mr (JP) McManus (owner of Brelan D'As) and I was pleased to reverse the placings in that respect. Hopefully he might send me a horse now."</p>
      <p>Paul Nicholls was satisfied with the Brelan D'As' effort in second place.</p>
      <p>He said: "In my mind I knew he was always going to get the trip. It was a really good run and I'm thrilled with him."</p>
