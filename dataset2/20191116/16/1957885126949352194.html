      <p><b>News</b> by Wesley Yin-Poole, Deputy Editor Updated on 16 November 2019</p>
      <p>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare has been datamined to within an inch of its life, revealing a raft of details about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-08-08-it-sounds-like-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-will-get-a-battle-royale-mode">the inevitable battle royale mode</a>.</p>
      <p>Over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/dx4me0/battle_royale_coming_to_modern_warfare_map/">the Modern Warfare subreddit</a>, notorious Call of Duty leaker Senescallo posted the massive map for the battle royale.</p>

      <p>Other images revealed by Senescallo set the scene for the battle royale, which is reportedly due out early 2020 and is co-developed by Infinity Ward and fellow Activision-owned studio Raven.</p>

      <p>The leak reveals a full list of zones and points of interest, perks and killstreaks. The default options set the player count at 200, with modes for solo, duos and squads of four.</p>
      <p>As players have already pointed out, Modern Warfare's battle royale map includes the huge Ground War and Spec Ops maps inside it. It's massive, then, but so it should be if we're looking at a 200-player experience.</p>

      <p>There's an interesting-sounding respawn mechanic. Respawn Tokens can be looted (after you use one they're disabled for you). To respawn a teammate you have to burn your Respawn Token and drag their body to the Ambulance. This enters them into the Gulag queue (at some point in the match the Gulag closes, thus preventing respawns).</p>
      <p>The Gulag sounds cool - this prison camp gives players the chance to get back into the match by winning a 1v1 fight. Players in the Gulag queue spectate the players currently fighting in the Gulag, with a countdown showing how long you have left before it's your turn to fight.</p>
      <p>Apparently a jailbreak happens every so often and kicks all the players out of the Gulag and back into the match. Interestingly, you can place bets on the players who are fighting in the Gulag using Plunder, which, according to Senescallo's post, you earn by completing missions and eliminating enemies. You spend plunder on items at plunder box locations, and can convert it into experience points by depositing it into ATM machines (when players enter a bank, the bank alarm will sound, alerting other players to your presence). Senescallo has even uncovered an image for Plunder.</p>

      <p>Missions include Assassniation (eliminate a specific player), Domination (capture a Domination point) and Scavenger Hunt (collect Scavenger Crates). Loot comes in rarities, as you'd expect, there's limited inventory space, and there are different levels of armour (level one helmet, for example).</p>
      <p>Now, while this information is unconfirmed right now, this is a significant leak for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and gives us a detailed idea of the kind of experience the developers are shooting for. The question is, how will it be delivered? Free? Premium DLC? Or maybe standalone?</p>
