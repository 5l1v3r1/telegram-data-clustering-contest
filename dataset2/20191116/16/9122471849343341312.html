      <h1>Urban Meyer Gives Harsh Assessment Of Michigan State Football</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T16:56:16+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 16:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>The Michigan State football program is in the midst of a down season. The Spartans have lost four-straight games, including an embarrassing defeat against Illinois last weekend.</p>
      <p>College football analysts from around the country have taken notice and called out Mark Dantonio and the coaching staff for their job this season.</p>
      <p>Add former Ohio State head coach Urban Meyer to that list. Meyer, when asked about the state of the Michigan State football program, painted an ugly picture for the Spartans.</p>
      <p>“You watch Michigan State play, how many NFL players do they got? That doesn’t look like the defenses I used to go against. They had first-round corners, Le’Veon Bell. I don’t see that. That’s coaches, recruiting development,” Meyer said.</p>

      <p>It’s a harsh assessment from a former coach within the conference.</p>
      <p>However, it’s difficult to argue against Meyer’s comments. The Spartans have struggled mightily this season and are set for a huge rivalry game against Michigan.</p>
      <p>If Michigan State falls to it’s in-state rival, the road to a bowl game becomes a little more difficult. With Rutgers and Maryland left on the schedule, the Spartans have a chance, but it’s still not where they wanted to be at the start of the season.</p>
