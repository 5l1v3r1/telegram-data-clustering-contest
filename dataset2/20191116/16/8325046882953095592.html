        <li>New court papers filed by Meghan Markle’s lawyers against Associated Newspapers, which own the Mail and Mail on Sunday newspapers, say the tabloids fabricated entire stories about her home renovations.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.bylineinvestigates.com/mail/2019/11/15/noen2cgslou82nzpgi0g3mpjebpd6i">Byline Investigates reports</a> that the court claims include lying to readers about publishing a “full” letter sent from Markle to her father and omitting passages because they did not fit the narrative the paper pushed about Markle.</li>
        <li>Markle is <a href="https://www.insider.com/meghan-markle-lawsuit-mail-on-sunday-prince-harry-statement-2019-10">also accusing</a> the tabloids of making up entire claims about her baby shower, her relationship with her mother, and purchases and renovations she had done for her and Prince Harry’s home, Frogmore Cottage.</li>
        <li>The claims the Duchess is asserting <a href="https://www.bylineinvestigates.com/mail/2019/11/15/noen2cgslou82nzpgi0g3mpjebpd6i">are false</a> include her purchasing a $6,400 copper bathtub, a $640,000 soundproofing system, an orangery, a yoga studio, a tennis court, and a guest wing, which the court papers say don’t exist, so could not have been paid for with taxpayers’ money.</li>

      <p>New court papers obtained <a href="https://www.bylineinvestigates.com/mail/2019/11/15/noen2cgslou82nzpgi0g3mpjebpd6i">by Byline Investigates</a> reveal some of the specific claims that Meghan Markle is accusing the British tabloids of in her fight against what <a href="https://www.insider.com/prince-harry-phone-hacking-case-british-tabloids-meghan-markle-2019-10">Prince Harry called</a> “lie after lie at her expense.”</p>
      <p>Both Markle and Prince Harry issued <a href="https://www.insider.com/prince-harry-phone-hacking-case-british-tabloids-meghan-markle-2019-10">legal proceedings against</a> British tabloid owners in early October, with Markle filing claim against Associated Newspapers, which owns the Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday, for misuse of private information, copyright infringement, and a breach of the Data Protection Act 2018.</p>
      <p>More specifically, according to <a href="https://www.bylineinvestigates.com/mail/2019/11/15/noen2cgslou82nzpgi0g3mpjebpd6i">the documents</a> filed by her lawyers reported by Byline Investigates, Markle is accusing the Mail of running a three-year fake news campaign against her, including the fabrication of stories about her relationship with her mother, her baby shower, and purchases and renovations for her Frogmore Cottage home with Prince Harry.</p>
      <p>Accusations stemming from the Mail on Sunday’s publication of a handwritten letter Markle sent to her father, Thomas Markle, had already surfaced. Markle claims that the Mail <a href="https://www.insider.com/meghan-markle-mail-on-sunday-lawsuit-letter-thomas-markle-people-2019-10">omitted passages</a> to make her seem less sympathetic. Now, she also says the Mail lied to readers by stating that the letter was published in full when just a little more than half of the five-page letter was printed.</p>
      <h3>Markle also accuses the Mail of publishing fake news about her, specifically her home renovations and baby shower</h3>
      <p>In excerpts of the new court filings, obtained <a href="https://www.bylineinvestigates.com/mail/2019/11/15/noen2cgslou82nzpgi0g3mpjebpd6i">by Byline Investigates</a>, Markle’s lawyers point to multiple articles published in the Mail that make claims about what Markle had purchased for the estate she and Prince Harry moved into in spring 2019, before the birth of their son Archie.</p>
      <p>The Mail reported that Markle had “splashed out £5,000,” or $6,400, on a copper bathtub, which Markle says does not exist. Another article claimed she and Prince Harry spent £500,000, or $640,000, on soundproofing the home to block out the noise of airplanes, which the court filings say “does not exist and is completely untrue.”</p>
      <p>Other articles said Markle and Prince Harry had installed a yoga studio, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6427587/Meghan-Harrys-secret-plans-new-cosy-Windsor-cottage-hidden-taxpayers.html">an orangery</a>, and a tennis court, and built an entire “guest wing” of the estate for Markle’s mother to stay in during visits, all of which the filings say are untrue and do not exist. The Mail further stated that all of the purchases and renovations were made with taxpayers’ money, which Markle’s lawyers say is “false and misleading.”</p>

      <p>In addition to those articles, the <a href="https://www.bylineinvestigates.com/mail/2019/11/15/noen2cgslou82nzpgi0g3mpjebpd6i">court filings</a> also take aim at articles that described Markle as <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3896180/Prince-Harry-s-girlfriend-actress-Meghan-Markles.html">“(almost) straight outta Compton,”</a> which her lawyers say are intended to be “divisive” and paint an untrue picture of her upbringing and her relationship with her family.</p>
      <p>Other articles published by the Mail suggested that a community kitchen Markle worked with for a <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6423517/Mosque-supported-Meghan-Markles-charity-cookbook-links-19-terrorists.html">charity cookbook project had ties to jihadist terrorists</a>, and another linked one of Markle’s favorite foods, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6621047/How-Meghans-favourite-avocado-snack-fuelling-human-rights-abuses-drought-murder.html">avocado toast, to “human rights abuses, drought, and murder.”</a> Her lawyers called the connections in these articles “highly tenuous and deliberately inflammatory.”</p>
      <p>The Mail also ran articles saying that Markle’s former aide “walked out” on her because she was “difficult,” which <a href="https://www.bylineinvestigates.com/mail/2019/11/15/noen2cgslou82nzpgi0g3mpjebpd6i">her lawyers say</a> is untrue because the aide came out of retirement and extended the original year she intended to work for both Markle and Prince Harry in their office.</p>
      <p>In addition, the court documents <a href="https://www.bylineinvestigates.com/mail/2019/11/15/noen2cgslou82nzpgi0g3mpjebpd6i">criticized an article</a> stating that Markle threw a $300,000 baby shower while her mother was spotted in LA by herself. Markle’s lawyers said the baby shower cost a fraction of that, and that Markle’s mother was invited on the pretense of paid airline tickets, but her mother had work obligations.</p>
      <p>It also said that the line in the article suggesting that “not a single guest had known [Markle] for more than a decade” was “untrue and offensive to suggest.”</p>
