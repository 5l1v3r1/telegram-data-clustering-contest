      <p>Lupita Nyong’o was ‘truly out of her comfort zone’ for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/01/lupita-nyongo-battles-zombies-armed-ukulele-new-little-monsters-trailer-10498118/">new zombie comedy Little Monsters</a>, director Abe Forsythe has said.</p>
      <p>The Us star took a<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/03/20/jordan-peeles-twisted-thriller-us-will-stay-days-lupita-nyongo-steals-show-8952997/"> break from being the queen of horror</a> for the Aussie-based flick, starring as a kindergarten teacher who has to protect her class from a zombie apocalypse – and convince them all it’s just a game.</p>
      <p>Joining forces with Frozen’s Josh Gad and Alexander England, as well as a whole host of 5-year-olds, it’s definitely something different for her.</p>
      <p>‘Lupita likes to be out of her comfort zone. She and I have talked a lot about that,’ Abe told <b>Metro.co.uk.</b></p>
      <p>‘If you’re on the edge, you put in 110% and you discover something you didn’t know you were capable of.’</p>
      <p>He pointed out: ‘Lupita flew halfway around the world to work on a low-budget movie, an extreme comedy with zombies and 5-year-old children, she truly put herself out of her comfort zone.</p>

      <p>‘I know she had a lot of nerves and a lot of trepidation about it, but there wasn’t a single take where she didn’t give me something beautiful and it’s all in the movie.’</p>
      <p>Explaining how he dealt with her nerves, Abe said: ‘It’s about making her – any actor – feel safe. She’d never played the ukulele before, she’d never sung before, the most important thing you can do as a director is letting them know you’re there for them and you’re going to give them the freedom to try anything to find the right moment.</p>
      <p>‘But at the same time you’re not going to make them look stupid.’</p>

      <p>In the unique comedy, Lupita’s character Miss Caroline <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/01/30/taylor-swifts-shake-off-helped-lupita-nyongo-hard-time-professionally-8412523/">deals with her nerves by belting out some Taylor Swift, with Shake It Off being used in a big way.</a></p>
      <p>And it’s no secret that the use of the song is down to Lupita, as she penned a letter to Taylor asking to use it in an absolutely boss move.</p>
      <p>In fact, Abe revealed that the song is one of the most ‘meaningful’ aspects of the movie for her.</p>
      <p>‘She reacted to a whole bunch of truthful and very specific things that I put into the script,’ Abe recalled.</p>

      <p>And it turns out she was pretty surprised they managed to pull the whole thing off, with Abe recalling: ‘At the end of the shoot, when we finally got through it all – and it was one of the most difficult shoots anyone would experience because there’s so many logistical elements with trying to make a horror movie with children – there was this one moment.</p>

      <p>‘When she finished, we had the wrap party, a couple of days later she and I went and had a cup of tea together…just before she got out of the car she turned to me and said “I have no idea how this happened.”</p>
      <p>‘And I looked at her and I said “Yeah I don’t either.”’</p>
      <p>You know what they say – never work with children or zombies.</p>
