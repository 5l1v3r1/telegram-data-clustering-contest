        <b>Meghan McCain was hit with a Twitter backlash after she appeared to celebrate the potential prison death of Roger Stone by tweeting, “rot in hell.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>Stone was convicted on 7 counts in his federal trial yesterday and faces a jail sentence of up to 50 years. If hit with a term of anything more than 10 years, he is likely to die in prison.</p>
      <p>“Rot in hell, Roger Stone,” tweeted McCain in response.</p>

      <p>McCain’s tweet is particularly vile and hypocritical given that she has constantly complained about people celebrating her father’s death.</p>
      <p>Respondents to the tweet didn’t hold back</p>
      <p>“I thought he was going to prison, not vacationing with your father,” wrote one.</p>

      <p>“We all know your dad had a VIP spot in Hell,” tweeted Rhoda Ross-Williams.</p>

      <p>“Didn’t you complain when people said the same about your Dad?” asked lawyer Robert Barnes.</p>

      <p>“Any last ounce of respect I had for you (and it wasn’t much!) is officially gone now!” remarked Courtney Holland.</p>

      <p>And finally, McCain blocked yours truly merely for suggesting that it wasn’t classy to celebrate anyone’s death.</p>
