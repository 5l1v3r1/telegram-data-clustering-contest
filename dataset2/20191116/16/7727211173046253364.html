      <h2>Bobby Duncan has been speaking about his transfer switch from Liverpool to Fiorentina</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T16:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/paul-clarke/" target="_blank">Paul Clarke</a></address>
      <p>Former Liverpool youth star Bobby Duncan has explained the reasons behind his switch to Fiorentina, insisting that the move to the Serie A was not money motivated.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/bobby-duncan">Duncan</a> was prolific in front of goal for <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a>'s youth sides last season and helped the club win the FA Youth Cup.</p>
      <p>But following a string of accusations against the club were made by his agent, the 18-year-old made an acrimonious departure from the club.</p>
      <p>Duncan was worried about his lack of game-time options moving forward due to the brilliance of Sadio Mane, Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino, while Rhian Brewster is also waiting in the wings.</p>
      <p>The teenage sensation was quick to admit it was a tough call to make but he's happy with the results after bagging three goals in six Primavera (under-20s competition) games.</p>
      <p>"It was a difficult decision to be honest," Duncan told <a href="https://www.violanation.com/2019/11/15/20959054/fiorentina-player-spotlight-a-conversation-with-primavera-star-bobby-duncan">ViolaNation.com</a>. "I was in a difficult moment at that time.</p>
      <p>"Something was missing. It wasn't over money. It wasn't over anything else other than I want to play first team football soon.</p>
      <p>"Liverpool has Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino, Sadio Mane, Rhian Brewster. That front three is the best front three in the world. It was hard to knock them down.</p>
      <p>"In my mind, I thought I would go and play abroad. Serie A is just below the Premier League. I wanted to make a name for myself, show the Liverpool and Fiorentina fans who I am."</p>
      <p>Duncan, the cousin of Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard, still has a soft spot for the Reds but is now fully embedded at Fiorentina.</p>
      <p>"I always loved Liverpool, but my love now is to the Fiorentina fans. I need to repay them for showing me the love since I arrived," Duncan added.</p>
