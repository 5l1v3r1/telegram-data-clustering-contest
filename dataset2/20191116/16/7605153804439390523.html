        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 16 – Kenya Harlequin’s hopes of picking first win of the season in Kenya cup went up in smoke after the Ngong Road based side fell 18-25 to hosts Nakuru RFC in a match played at the Nakuru Athletic Club Saturday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The win saw Nakuru rise off the bottom of the table after grounding four unanswered second half tries to get the bonus point win over Quins who remain winless after four rounds of the season.</p>
      <p>Monate Akuei’s early penalty gave the hosts a 3-0 lead after twenty minutes of play but Quins responded in stylish fashion, brilliant interplay between Lyle Asiligwa and Patrice Agunda setting up Patrice Agunda for the first try of the game, Asiligwa converting to give the visitors a 7-3 lead four minutes later.</p>

      <p>Quins went 10-3 up through Asiligwa’s drop goal on the half hour before Brian Onyiego took them 15-3 up with an unconverted try two minutes later, another Asiligwa penalty gave them an 18-3 lead at the interval.</p>
      <p>Nakuru were gun blazing after the restart, cutting the deficit to five points through quick-fire tries from Hannington Wabwire and John Okoth, the score board reading 18-13 in Quins favor.</p>
      <p>They then drew level when Jenkins Kipruto barged over the whitewash, the game all square, 18-18 with roughly twenty five minutes of the second half to play.</p>
      <p>Collins Onyango then sliced through the Quins defense to land the go ahead try for Nakuru, Akuei’s conversion taking Nakuru 25-18 up, a lead that they held to full time.</p>
      <p>Despite the loss, Quins got a bonus point for losing by seven points.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Kabras Sugar stayed top with a 40-15 win over hosts Nondescripts at the Jamhuri Park while champions KCB built on a 17-10 half time lead to blow away hosts Menengai Oilers 43-13 at Nakuru’s Moi Showground, staying unbeaten and level on points with Kabras Sugar.</p>

      <p>Impala Saracens needed a last gasp converted try to edge Stanbic Mwamba 26-24 at the Impala Club after trailing for virtually the game.</p>
      <p>Hosts Blak Blad overcame visiting Kisumu 31-3 at the Kenyatta University while Western Bulls were unable to repeat last weekend’s exploits against Quins, losing 36-17 to Menengai Cream Homeboyz at the RFUEA Ground.</p>
