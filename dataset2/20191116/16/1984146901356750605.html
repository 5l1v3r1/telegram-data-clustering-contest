      <p>It was one of the most infamous games in Newcastle United's history, but in the end the result did not even count.</p>
      <p>Today we look back at some of the dark moments in our football club's history where drama off the pitch, or sometimes spilling onto it, became more memorable than the action on on it.</p>
      <p>Back in 1974 despite the best efforts of players the result of a crucial game was declared void, because of the behaviour of fans.</p>

      <p>Almost 45 years ago the FA Cup was still seen as one of the world's biggest competitions.</p>
      <p>So on March 9 1974 more than 52,000 <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle United</a> supporters are believed to have crammed themselves into the stands at St James' Park, which at the usually saw an average attendance of just 32,000.</p>
      <p>The game they had come to see was Newcastle United v Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup quarter final.</p>

      <p>Notwithstanding what was due to kick-off the game looked was all set to be a memorable one anyway.</p>
      <p>Within minutes Forest took the lead through Ian Bowyer.  But Toon full-back David Craig brought the sides level again before Liam O’Kane put the visitors 2-1 ahead just before half time.</p>
      <p>Early in the second half Forest were awarded a penalty. NUFC keeper Pat Howard was sent off for arguing against the decision, then George Lyall scored.</p>

      <p>And it was while the score was standing at 3-1 that trouble began to break-out in the stands.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of teen fans began climbing out of the Leazes End, perhaps to to avoid being crushed, it has been said.</p>
      <p>They started to gather behind the goal before suddenly charging onto the pitch and running towards the Gallowgate End where the away fans were standing.</p>
      <p>The game was held up for 10 minutes as <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/northumbria-police">police </a>with dogs battled to clear the pitch and restore order, while referee Gordon Kew and the players retreated to the dressing room.</p>

      <p>Pictures from the time capture the dramatic scenes as fans wearing flares tussle with police officers, in front of what look like frighteningly full stands.</p>
      <p>Ironically, once order was restored Newcastle United managed a comeback, despite being down to 10 men.</p>
      <p>A Terry McDermott penalty reduced the deficit to 3-2, before John Tudor made it 3-3 with a diving header.</p>
      <p>Then finally 'Supermac' Malcolm Macdonald set-up captain Bobby Moncur to make it 4-3 in the dying seconds.</p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly the dramatic late comeback sent the already impassioned crowd into ecstasy.</p>
      <p>Their joy, however, was short lived as the FA declared the result void following a complaint from Forest claimed the pitch invasion had changed the pattern of play.</p>
      <p>Newcastle United did however progress in the competition, after two replays at Everton’s Goodison Park, and even reached the final.</p>
      <p>But the Magpies were thrashed by a Liverpool side, that included Kevin Keegan at Wembly.</p>
