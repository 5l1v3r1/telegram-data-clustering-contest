      <p>Former North Carolina State guard Anthony Grundy died after police found him injured while responding to a call for a domestic dispute, police in Louisville, Ky., said.</p>
      <p>He was 40.</p>
      <p>Police said the incident occurred Thursday night near the home of Grundy’s mother. When police arrived, Grundy was in the street, bleeding, and taken to University Hospital. He was pronounced dead there.</p>
      <p>He died of “multiple sharp force injuries to the body,” the Jefferson County Coroner’s Office said, per the Louisville Courier-Journal.</p>
      <p>The News &amp; Observer in Raleigh, N.C., reported an unidentified suspect was taken into custody at the scene but charges had not been filed. Police did not confirm that report and said the investigation is continuing.</p>
      <p>Grundy, a 6-foot-3 guard, played at NC State from 1998-2002, earning All-Atlantic Coast Conference honors in his senior season. He led the Wolfpack in scoring that season with 17.8 points.</p>
      <p>He played 12 games for the Atlanta Hawks in the 2005-06 season, part of a 12-year pro career largely played overseas.</p>
