      <p>In just under an hour, one of the best rivalry games in the country kicks off from Ann Arbor.</p>
      <p>No. 15 Michigan hosts Michigan State in a rivalry game that has produced some of the most-memorable moments in recent college football history.</p>
      <p>The Spartans are in the midst of a down season. Mark Dantonio’s squad has lost four-straight including an abysmal performance against Illinois last weekend.</p>
      <p>However, Sparty is looking to turn things around with a big win over their in-state rival. It looks like the Spartans are ready for battle this afternoon.</p>
      <p>Michigan State’s players came off the bus wearing their helmets.</p>

      <p>The Wolverines likely won’t be intimidated by their “little brother” today. However, Michigan State won the last time these two programs played in Ann Arbor, taking down Jim Harbaugh and the Wolverines by a final score of 14-10.</p>
      <p>Last season, Michigan avenged that loss with a 21-7 win over Michigan State in East Lansing.</p>
      <p>The Wolverines enter this afternoon’s contest as a heavy favorite. Vegas made Michigan a 14-point favorite over the 4-5 Spartans.</p>
      <p>Michigan State needs to win two more games to become bowl eligible. Will one of those games come against a bitter rival this afternoon?</p>
      <p>Stay tuned for the latest.</p>
