      <p>The gang at Screen Junkies has released an Honest Trailer for the<i> Fast and Furious</i> spinoff film <b><i>Hobbs and Shaw</i></b> and it has a fun time joking around about the ridiculousness of the film. While I did enjoy Hobbs &amp; Shaw, there’s certainly a lot of stuff in at that is just asking to be made fun of! One of the more amusing aspects of this Honest Trailer is how it points out how this film took <i>Fast and Furious </i>franchise into the superhero genre and shows many of the instances in it that are very similar to what has already been done in the Marvel franchise. Check out the Honest trailer and let us know what you thought of the film!</p>
