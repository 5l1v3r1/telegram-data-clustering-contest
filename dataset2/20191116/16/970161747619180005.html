      <p>A <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/brexit/">Brexit</a> Party MEP said he would rather remain in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/european-union/">European Union</a> than go along with Boris Johnson’s Withdrawal Agreement.</p>
      <p>Ben Habib told Sophy Ridge on Sky he thinks the PM’s deal would be ‘much worse’ than staying inside the bloc, but didn’t say whether his comments reflected his party’s official position.</p>
      <p>‘What we really need to do is get the Prime Minister to pivot away from the Withdrawal Agreement,’ he said.</p>
      <p>‘I see the Withdrawal Agreement as much worse than Remain, frankly.’</p>

      <p>Habib added that the Prime Minister’s deal will leave Northern Ireland ‘bereft’.</p>
      <p>Pressed on why his party is standing down in Conservative seats, he said: ‘The Tories are not hostile to Brexit.’</p>

      <p>Explaining his party’s decision, Habib said they feared creating a hung parliament or handing power to the Labour Party.</p>
      <p>He added: ‘The key for us was to try and get a Leave-sympathetic majority of parliamentarians in Parliament, and we could have cut that cake in a number of different ways, but the way we decided to do it was to simply stand down against the Tories in those 317 seats,’</p>
      <p>Asked why the Brexit Party is still standing in marginal constituencies held by Labour MPs, he said: ‘What we’d hoped was that the Tories would respond positively to the enormously generous offer that we made two weeks ago which was for them to stand down in the 150-odd seats that they haven’t won for over 100 years in the Labour heartlands.’</p>
      <p>He said this would have resulted in a ‘very strong Leave majority’ in Parliament.</p>

      <p>Mr Habib said his party hung on to the ‘forlorn hope’ the Tories might still do so.</p>
      <p>When asked about allegations the Conservatives have offered jobs and peerages in return for candidates standing down, he said: ‘I am aware that a number of my colleagues have been pressed.</p>

      <p>‘Ann Widdecombe, for example, was offered some sort of negotiating position with the Tory Party, from Number 10, someone from Number 10 called Ann.</p>
      <p>‘I know there have been lots of conversations going on, and discussions, and pressure has been brought to bear.’</p>
      <p>But he was unable to say how many people he claimed had been pressured.</p>
      <p>Asked whether his comments amount to saying the Tories are lying by refuting the allegations, Mr Habib said: ‘I’m saying they’re being economical with the truth for sure. Absolutely. It has been going on. Without a shadow of a doubt.’</p>
