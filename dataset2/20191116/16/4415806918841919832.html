      <h1>At least 18 killed in Syria car bomb attack</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T16:42:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 16:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/press-association/" target="_blank">By Press Association</a></address>
      <p>A car bomb has killed at least 18 people in a Syrian town controlled by Turkey-backed opposition fighters, activists have said.</p>
      <p>The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that 19 people, including 13 civilians, were killed on Saturday in the town of al-Bab in Aleppo province.</p>
      <p>The Aleppo Media Centre, an activist collective, said 15 people were killed in the blast in a busy part of town near a bus station.</p>
      <p>Turkey’s Defence Ministry, meanwhile, said the blast killed 18 people and blamed the main Kurdish militia, known as the People’s Protection Units.</p>
      <p>Different casualty figures are common in the immediate aftermath of explosions.</p>
      <p>No-one has yet claimed responsibility for the attack.</p>
      <p>A video posted online by Albab City, an activist collective, showed several vehicles on fire with black smoke billowing from a wide street with shops on both sides. Inside the bus station, several white minibuses appeared to be damaged.</p>
      <p>“It looks like doomsday. May God help us,” a man could be heard saying as five young men carried an injured person away.</p>
      <p>Explosions have killed and wounded scores of people in Turkish-held areas of north-eastern Syria in recent months.</p>
      <p>Those attacks have come amid an expanding Turkish invasion of Syrian Kurdish-held towns and villages along a stretch of the border.</p>
