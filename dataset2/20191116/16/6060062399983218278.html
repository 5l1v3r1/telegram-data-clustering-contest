      <p>The two students killed by a classmate in a <a href="https://www.insider.com/santa-clarita-high-school-shooting-injuries-suspect-2019-11">shooting at a high school in Santa Clarita, California</a>, have been identified.</p>
      <p>Fourteen-year-old Dominic Blackwell and 15-year-old Gracie Anne Muehlberger were identified by the Los Angeles County coroner's office as the two students to die in <a href="https://www.insider.com/saugus-shooting-santa-clarita-students-describe-what-happened-2019-11">Thursday's shooting at Saugus High School</a>. Three other students, a boy and two girls, were hospitalized with injuries but expected to recover, <a href="https://abc7.com/saugus-high-shooting-coroner-ids-2-teens-killed-by-classmate/5699580/">according to ABC 7 News</a>.</p>
      <p>The gunman, <a href="https://www.insider.com/california-school-shooting-suspect-nathaniel-berhow-2019-11">identified as 16-year-old Nathaniel Berhow</a>, shot himself in the head <a href="https://www.insider.com/number-of-mass-shootings-in-america-this-year-2019-8">after opening fire</a> and died the following day.</p>
      <p>Tributes for Gracie and Dominic poured out on social media following <a href="https://www.insider.com/off-duty-officers-first-responders-heroes-saugus-high-school-shooting-2019-11">the shooting</a>.</p>
      <p>In a statement posted on a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/gracie-anne-muehlberger?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unknown&amp;utm_campaign=comms_tlhj+gracie-anne-muehlberger">GoFundMe for Gracie's family</a>, her parents called her the "light of our lives."</p>
      <p>"It is with the most unexplainable brokenness that we share our Gracie went to be with Jesus on Thursday morning," said a statement on the GoFundMe. "Our vivacious, funny, loyal, light of our lives, Cinderella, the daughter we always dreamed to have, fiercely strong and lover of all things fashionable â€” was our best friend. She is going to be missed more than words will ever be able to express."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/dominic-michael-blackwell">A GoFundMe for Dominic</a> described the 14-year-old as a "shining light personified by a goofy laugh, cheesy smile, and a huge, caring heart."</p>
      <p><a href="https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2019/11/15/gracie-anne-muehlbergerdominic-blackwell-saugus-high-school-shooting-victims/">Neighbors told CBS Los Angeles</a> that Dominic came from an "incredible family" that was "very loving."</p>
      <p>"This has been a very traumatic situation for the community for my neighborhood in particular," Dave Lyznick, a neighbor of the Blackwell family, told CBS Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Sheriff Alex Villanueva said on Friday that the gunman's attack was planned, though the targets appeared to be random.</p>
      <p>"It was deliberate. He knew how many rounds he had, for example," Villanueva said, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/santa-clarita-gunman-was-experienced-shooter-with-easy-access-to-firearms-cops/">according to the New York Post</a>. "He seemed very familiar with firing the weapon."</p>
      <p>Tyler Nilson, a 17-year-old senior who was on the cross country team with Nathaniel, told Insider that he never would have expected this from his classmate.</p>
      <p>"To an extent I feel ashamed that I didn't know him better, since we weren't super close friends," he told Insider. "We're all bewildered, since he never stood out as a loner or as the aggressive type. He was somebody I'd least expect to commit such an atrocity."</p>
