      <p><b>MONROE, La. (KNOE) - </b>The GeauxVote Mobile app and Voter Portal stopped working for a short period of time on Election Day.</p>
      <p>Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin announced the problem on his Facebook page around 3:20 p.m. They started working about 30 minutes after the problem was announced.</p>
      <p>Officials have not said what caused the app and Voter Portal to stop working correctly.</p>
      <p>Because the GeauxVote Mobile app and Voter Portal were down, people could not look up information like voting locations or a sample ballot. Polls close at 8 p.m.</p>
      <p>If you need assistance, contact the Elections Division at 800-883-2805.</p>
