      <p>It seems that Apple’s iPhones are <b>required to support e-wallets other than their very own Apple Pay</b>, based on a <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/15/use-nfc-chip/">court ruling</a> in Germany that was passed very recently. The court ruling required all “operators of electronic money infrastructure” to allow e-wallet integration, at a reasonable fee which means that you could use your Apple device to make payments even without Apple Pay.</p>
      <p>With that said, Apple did not mention on when will they allow third-party e-wallets to utilize the NFC feature found on most modern iPhones. Not only that, but they also did not mention whether third-party e-wallets from countries other than Germany would be able to integrate their e-wallets.</p>
      <p>Would the iPhone be a much better product if it supports e-wallets other than Apple Pay? Let us know on our Facebook page, and for more updates like this stay tuned to TechNave.com.</p>
