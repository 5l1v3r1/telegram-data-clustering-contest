      <h1>Jadon Sancho’s response to supporter’s “Please sign for Manchester United” plea</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T16:17:33+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 16:17</time> by <a rel="author">Jaikuran Randhawa</a></address>
      <p>England’s decision to live stream the senior squad’s training session recently appears to have added fuel to the fire that Jadon Sancho could potentially join Manchester United.</p>
      <p>One Red Devils supporter asked the 19-year-old to “Please sign for United” and the Borussia Dortmund star laughed off the plea after taking a selfie with the fan.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/jadon-sancho-laughs-off-manchester-united-links-supporter-begs-make-old-trafford-move-11167121/?ito=article.mweb.share.top.twitter">Metro</a>, Liverpool, Manchester City, Real Madrid and Barcelona are all interested in the ace who is valued at a staggering £120m.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/15/manchester-united-transfer-jadon-sancho-dortmund">The Guardian</a> understand that United are weighing up a move for the star after his recent troubles with Dortmund.</p>
      <p>The ace was punished for returning to Germany late after the last international break and faced criticism from manager Lucien Favre last week.</p>

      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is in serious need of bolstering his United squad, the Red Devils have a void at right-wing which Sancho’s signature would definitely fill.</p>
      <p>The exciting youngster is establishing himself as an important player for the England team in the run-up to Euro 2020, the ace was very impressive in the Three Lions’ 7-0 win over Montenegro on Thursday night.</p>
