      <h2>The devastated parents of Morgan say they have been overwhelmed by the support they have received from the teenager's friends since he 'fell asleep' earlier this month</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T16:32:38+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 16:32</time> by <a rel="author">James Rodger, Richard Ault, https://www.facebook.com/jamesrodgerjournalist</a></address>
      <p>The friends of a tragic 18-year-old have been lauded by his parents after creating a shrine in his memory.</p>
      <p>Morgan Symcox tragically died aged just 18 earlier this month.</p>
      <p>The teen, from the Midlands, left friends and loved ones devastated, and now grief-stricken pals have created a stunning tribute.</p>
      <p>The devastated parents of Morgan say they have been overwhelmed by the support they have received from the teenager's friends since he 'fell asleep' earlier this month.</p>
      <p>They now make daily visits to the bench - on Wolstanton Marsh - where Morgan spent so much time with his friends, reports <a href="https://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/news/stoke-on-trent-news/this-means-much-us-devastated-3542727">StokeonTrentLive</a> .</p>

      <p>It has been covered with dozens of bouquets of flowers, balloons, photographs and messages to Morgan who used to attend Alpha School, in Hanley. His friends have been keeping a vigil at the site.</p>
      <p>Now the friends want to raise money for a plaque and a second bench - which Morgan always said he wanted so friends could sit opposite each other and chat.</p>

      <p>Dad Damon Symcox, aged 42, of May Bank, said: "We go to the bench because that's where he was happiest. He loved his mates.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes I'd say, 'can't you stay in tonight'. I didn't understand why he always wanted to go to the bench, but I understand it now.</p>
      <p>"You realise that his mates care about him as much as we do.</p>
      <p>"I have been to the bench every day, it feels closer to him.</p>
      <p>"Whenever you go there's always someone there, it's amazing.</p>
      <p>"When you read that someone has passed away in the paper, everyone says that they were the heart and soul, but Morgan really was.</p>
      <p>"If you met Morgan for five minutes, then six-months later you would still remember him.</p>
      <p>"You don't realise how popular someone is until you lose them."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Mum Liz, aged 42, said: "Morgan was a very popular lad,</p>
      <p>"We are living in hell, but his friends lost him too and they have made that lovely bench.</p>
      <p>"It has been their meeting point since they were about 13.</p>
      <p>"They must have put about 40 or 50 bouquets of flowers, and 60 or 70 photographs.</p>
      <p>"Morgan loved going out and socialising, everything was about his friends.</p>
      <p>"His friends have done a memory box which they are going to bury. They want to pay for a plaque on the bench.</p>
      <p>"When we go to the bench and see his friends and cry and give them a hug they hug you back.</p>
      <p>"They will never know how much it means to us."</p>

      <p>Morgan was found pronounced dead in the bedroom of the family's May Bank home on Saturday, November 2. The exact cause of his death is still not known.</p>
      <p>Liz added: "He just fell asleep.</p>
      <p>"Morgan was about to start an apprenticeship as a plumber.</p>
      <p>"We are a really close family. Earlier this year we went on holiday for five days in Poland, then we went to Turkey for two weeks."</p>
      <p>Morgan had two sisters - Keely, aged 23, and three-year-old Annie - who he doted on.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Keely said: "He loved documentaries and history. He knew everything worth knowing. He loved tanning and sun beds, he loved his food and designer clothes.</p>
      <p>"He loved life, that's why it's so cruel and sad.</p>
      <p>"He was my best friend. He was lovable and funny, he would make anyone laugh, and he was very loyal.</p>
      <p>"All his friends say they are living in Morgan's world. Everything they do now, they say it's for Morgan's world. That's their way of coping.</p>
      <p>"When we go to the bench and see his friends there's no awkwardness, it's like we are all together."</p>

      <p>Morgan's girlfriend, Lily Mason, aged 17, of Chesterton, said: "He would have done anything for those close to him.</p>
      <p>"He faced every single day with a smile on his face. He was so intelligent and funny.</p>
      <p>"I will never meet a more generous and lovely person. He was so loved by everyone around him.</p>
      <p>"He was one in a million."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Friend Dionne Dale, aged 18, of May Bank, said: "Anyone who knew Morg will know that he was the most positive, funny, wildest person to ever walk this Earth.</p>
      <p>"He never let anything faze him and always found a bright side to every situation.</p>
      <p>"His love for his family and friends was endless.</p>
      <p>"His big and little sister were his world. He could not have loved his mum and dad more if he tried and he always looked after his friends as if they were family.</p>
      <p>"Dying at such a young age was something he never deserved, and he loved the life he lived so much. He had so many plans for the future.</p>
      <p>"The pain and heartache that this has caused for his closest loved-ones is indescribable and has been a huge shock to everyone who knew him.</p>
      <p>"But, being the person he was, he would want us to wipe away our tears and celebrate his life."</p>
