      <p>This has been a bad stretch for video games social media, particularly the accounts of the sports publishers. 2K Games had their social media hacked almost across-the-board yesterday evening, including the account of 2K Sports’ Ronnie Singh, better known as Ronnie 2K.</p>
      <p>Singh’s Twitter account, which has 1.2 million followers, was snagged last night, and whoever got hold of it started tweeting a bunch of disparaging things about <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/nba-2k20/40576"><i>NBA 2K20</i></a><i>. </i>Other accounts caught in the blast included 2K Games itself on Twitter, the publisher’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/facebook">Facebook</a> page, and the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/franchise/borderlands/2633"><i>Borderlands</i></a><i> </i>Facebook page.</p>

      <p>This comes after a week in which hackers <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/8/20955150/fifa-20-collusion-match-dodging-discord-nycchris-kurt0411-esports">overran the accounts of EA Sports’ FIFA community managers</a>, and used their Twitter handles to post messages in support of a top-flight player banned for repeated abusive conduct. The community managers, in some cases, had to delete their accounts entirely.</p>
      <p>2K’s hack is a bit more significant, given Singh’s sizable followership and the fact 2K Sports has practically written the book on social media management, in building up <a href="https://www.polygon.com/franchise/nba-2k/832">NBA 2K</a> to a mainstream phenomenon over the past decade. It doesn’t mean they’re immune to security holes or back doors, though. Twitter’s own chief executive, Jack Dorsey, had his account <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/30/20841288/jack-dorsey-ceo-twitter-account-hacked-chuckle-gang-shane-dawson-james-charles">hacked at the end of August</a>, after all. The perpetrators apparently found a way in through another service that Twitter had acquired.</p>
      <p>So, just sayin’, might want to double-bag your social media logins, because “my Twitter was hacked” is an excuse practically no one accepts these days — even when it actually is.</p>
