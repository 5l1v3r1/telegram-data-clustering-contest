      <p>Castiel had become estranged from the brothers earlier this season, for destroying his surrogate son Jack's body to thwart a demon and his inadvertent role in longtime ally Rowena McLeod's death. With things turning desperate as the series finale grows ever closer, it appears the Winchesters have mended fences with him as they continue to face God.</p>
      <p>Airing Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET/PT on The CW, the final season of <a href="https://screenrant.com/supernatural-leviathans-god-joke-fan-criticism/">Supernatural</a> stars Jensen Ackles, Jared Padalecki, Misha Collins and Alexander Calvert.</p>
