      <p>Josina Anderson simply cannot leave well enough alone.</p>
      <p>The ESPN NFL reporter was already being blasted and trolled ever since she took to Twitter shortly after the brawl between the Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers where she seemingly accused Mason Rudolph of possibly saying something racist to cause Myles Garrett to go off.</p>

      <p>Instead of letting that go and moving on, she woke up on Saturday morning and posted a still shot that appeared to show Rudolph grabbing Garrett’s groin. She added to it with her caption with a hypothetical question about ‘a female’s private parts.’</p>

      <p>She got absolutely blasted for this take as well and she would soon delete it as well.</p>
      <p>Why? because the full video doesn’t support her claim whatsoever.</p>
