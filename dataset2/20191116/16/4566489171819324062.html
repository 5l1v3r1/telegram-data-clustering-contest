      <h1>Huge Czech protest marking Velvet Revolution demands PM quit</h1>

      <p>More than 200,000 Czechs flooded central Prague on Saturday to mark 30 years since the Velvet Revolution toppled communism in then-Czechoslovakia, with protesters demanding that billionaire Prime Minister Andrej Babis quit over allegations of graft.</p>
      <p>Some demonstrators waved flags or brandished banners calling for Babis to step down and chanted "shame!" and "resign!".</p>
      <p>Czech police tweeted there were "more than 200,000 people while others are still coming" to the protest at Letna park in central Prague.</p>
      <p>The mass protest comes on the eve of the 30th anniversary of the Velvet Revolution, which saw unprecedented protests and a general strike end four decades of Soviet-imposed totalitarianism in what was then Czechoslovakia.</p>
      <p>A former communist, the populist Babis faces a string of graft allegations and a conflict-of-interest probe by the European Commission centred on Agrofert, his sprawling farming, media and chemicals holding. Babis has denied any wrongdoing.</p>
      <p>He is also tagged as an agent in secret police files from the 1980s, something he has completely rejected.</p>

      <p>"I really don't like our prime minister's lies," protester Josef Plandor, who travelled from the eastern Czech village of Zasova, told AFP.</p>
      <p>"His huge conflict of interest, his lies, fraud, there's too much of that. He's not an honest man," said the 43-year-old forestry worker, adding that he was "sure" Babis would never quit.</p>
      <p>The Million Moments for Democracy movement, which organised the protest, called on Babis to either resolve his conflict of interest or step down.</p>
      <p>Some 250,000 people rallied in Prague in June demanding Babis step down in the largest protest since the Velvet Revolution.</p>
      <p>His minority coalition government is propped up by the Communist Party in parliament.</p>
