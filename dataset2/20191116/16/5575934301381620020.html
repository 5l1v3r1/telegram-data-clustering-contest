      <p><a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/btc-usd">Bitcoin</a> would need to surge past $US150,000 per coin to make an exchange-traded fund for the cryptocurrency work, Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder Tom Lee said, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-15/bitcoin-should-hit-150-000-before-an-etf-can-work-tom-lee-says?srnd=markets-vp">Bloomberg</a>. Such an advance would mark a roughly 1,670% increase from current levels.</p>
      <p>Several firms look to ride the hype behind crypto-coins through related ETFs, but the Securities and Exchange Commission has mostly stifled attempts to form such alternative assets. The $US200 billion crypto sector enjoyed a moderate recovery from an early-fall trough, but it still has a way to go to meet demand necessary for an ETF, Lee said.</p>
      <p>“The SEC needs to punt the ETF until crypto becomes bigger,” Lee reportedly said at conference in Singapore on Friday, adding that “demand for an ETF is monstrous.”</p>
      <p>Large fund releases can bring in around $US13 billion in first-year demand, and the buzz around cryptocurrencies remains healthy, according to Lee. His $US150,000 estimate requires a 1,670% gain from bitcoin’s current price.</p>
      <p>The digital currency traded at $US8,488 per coin at 3:00 p.m. ET Friday.</p>
      <p>The managing partner praised the SEC’s regulation around cryptocurrencies so far. The agency may “look like an obstacle,” but it’s doing a “great job” at keeping investors protected, he said, according to Bloomberg.</p>
      <p>“Institutions aren’t going to touch crypto if they think the SEC isn’t doing a good job,” Lee reportedly added.</p>
