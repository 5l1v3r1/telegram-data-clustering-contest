      <h1>Final Countdown singer tells Tories 'don't play song' he says isn't about Brexit</h1>
      <h2>The lead singer of the appropriately named Europe, Joey Tempest, has called on The Conservative Party to stop playing the 1986 smash hit</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T16:49:55+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 16:49</time> by <a rel="author">Milo Boyd, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/milo-boyd/</a></address>
      <p>The man responsible for producing one of the biggest hits of the 80s has demanded the Conservative Party stop using it for their campaign.</p>
      <p>Joey Tempest has urged the Tories to desist following the party's repeated playing of his 1986 smash The Final Countdown.</p>
      <p>The Europe front man is unhappy that the track -which takes inspiration from David Bowie's 'Space Oddity' - is being used to motivate campaigners at Conservative HQ.</p>
      <p>Adam Parson's, the band's manager, told Mail Online of Tempest's feelings about the way the song was being used.</p>

      <p>He suggested that the Conservative Party had misconstrued the meaning of the song if it was being played with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> in mind.</p>
      <p>Last year Tempest, who was born in Sweden before moving to London, told <a href="https://www.bigissue.com/interviews/we-asked-europe-frontman-joey-tempest-if-brexit-really-is-the-final-countdown/">The Big Issue</a> that he would have voted Remain had he got a British passport.</p>
      <p>"The song took a life of its own," he said of The Final Countdown.</p>
      <p>"It has been used by political parties – both Hillary and Trump used it. The song has started to be played more around new year, for new beginnings, but the ironic thing is it’s not really that positive.</p>
      <p>"It’s melancholy, in a minor key."</p>

      <p>A little bit of unpacking of the lyrics suggest they are more in the Remain camp than the Leave.</p>
      <p>"We're leaving together, But still it's farewell," the song opens in slightly gloomy fashion.</p>
      <p>"And maybe we'll come back, To Earth, who can tell?" Tempest continues, in lyrics which could be interpreted to suggest society is collectively away with the fairies at the moment.</p>
      <p>Whatever context it is being played in, Tempest does not approve of its use by politicians.</p>
      <p>"Joey does not condone any use in a political context," his manager told The Times.</p>
      <p>"This was written as a good-time hard rock song back in 1986."</p>
      <p>The Conservative Party was contacted for comment.</p>
