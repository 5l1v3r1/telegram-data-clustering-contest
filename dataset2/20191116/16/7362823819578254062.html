      <h1>'Furious' Trump sounds off on whistleblower, inquiry in exclusive interview with Dan Bongino</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T16:11:16+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 16:11</time> by <a rel="author">Julia Musto</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">President Trump</a> is right to be "furious" about <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/house-of-representatives/democrats">House Democrats'</a> <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry">impeachment </a>push, Fox News contributor Dan Bongino said Saturday.</p>
      <p>Appearing on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/media/fox-news-flash">"Fox &amp; Friends: Weekend</a>," Bongino said Democrats don't have a leg to stand on and that the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/jim-jordan-trump-impeachment-whistleblower-testify">whistleblower</a> was factually incorrect.</p>
      <p>In an <a href="https://bongino.com/podcast/">exclusive interview</a> Friday on "The Dan Bongino Show," the president sounded off on the impeachment inquiry, saying "everybody knows who the whistleblower is" and the person "has to be revealed."</p>

      <p>"The whistleblower <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/second-intelligence-official-mulling-whether-to-file-another-whistleblower-complaint-about-trumps-ukraine-call">wrote a report</a> which was mostly on the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/read-transcript-of-trumps-first-call-with-zelensky">phone call</a> that everybody now sees was a good call," Trump said. "So, fortunately, the call was transcribed by experts and transcribed beautifully. And that was the call when they saw it, when I released it. Then everything started going downhill."</p>
      <p>"It was a great interview," Bongino told "Fox &amp; Friends" hosts Ed Henry, Lisa Boothe and Pete Hegseth. "I'll tell you, it was going on during <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/the-impeachment-hearing-witnesses-who-is-marie-yovanovitch">Ambassador Yovanovitch's testimony</a>. And the president was, I think rightfully so, furious about what's going on."</p>

      <p>On Friday former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch testified in a public hearing before the House Intelligence Committee. She said she was ousted after a smear campaign led by Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who was trying to get dirt on the president's Democratic rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.</p>
      <p>But Yovanovitch could not supply the panel with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/marie-yovanovitch-president-trump-impeachment-hearing">information regarding any criminal activity or bribes</a> involving Trump.</p>
      <p>Bongino said he believes the president is so angry about the impeachment inquiry "because he really genuinely feels -- and I wholeheartedly agree based on actual evidence what Democrats don't have -- that he didn't do anything wrong."</p>

      <p>"So, he's furious about it, and I don't blame him for wanting to find out how the whistleblower got this thing so wrong," Bongino said.</p>
      <p>Yovanovitch was the third witness in the formal inquiry to testify publicly.<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/impeachment-hearing-witnesses-bill-taylor"> Bill Taylor</a>, the top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine, and senior <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/foreign-policy/state-department">State Department</a> official <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/impeachment-hearing-witnesses-george-kent">George Kent</a> testified Wednesday.</p>
      <p>"Do you realize there are three ringer witnesses -- Kent, Taylor, and Yovanovitch -- not one of them has any evidence of a crime?" Bongino questioned.</p>
      <p>"What are we doing here? Why are we wasting America's time?" he asked.</p>
