        <b>Stefanos Tsitsipas set up an ATP Finals showdown with Dominic Thiem or defending champion Alexander Zverev by beating Roger Federer.</b>
      </p>
      <p>ATP Finals debutant Stefanos Tsitsipas booked his place in Sunday’s final with a clinical 6-3 6-4 triumph over a wasteful Roger Federer at the O2 Arena.</p>
      <p>Tsitsipas was beaten by world number one Rafael Nadal in a marathon match on Friday but showed little sign of weariness as he claimed his second win over six-time ATP Finals champion Federer.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old saved 12 break points in his Australia Open victory over Federer in January and the world number three failed to take 11 out of 12 this time around.</p>
      <p>Tsitsipas made Federer pay, progressing into his sixth final of what has been a fantastic season, with Dominic Thiem or defending champion Alexander Zverev awaiting.</p>

      <p>Having held serve in game one, Tsitsipas broke at the first time of asking with a well-worked point to take control of the set.</p>
      <p>Tsitsipas saved three break points in game seven, though Federer subsequently held to love before winning a brilliant point at the culmination of a thrilling rally.</p>
      <p>Three set points went begging for Tsitsipas as Federer teed up a sixth opportunity to break, only for a long backhand to hand his opponent a reprieve.</p>
      <p>An incredible game rolled on, but at the seventh time of asking, Tsitsipas finally wrapped up a 47-minute first set.</p>

      <p>Federer started set two with a crisp hold, yet the Swiss found himself a set and a break down when he sent a weak effort into the net as Tsitsipas broke to love.</p>
      <p>But Federer responded brilliantly, taking a 40-love lead on Tsitsipas’ serve, only to once again squander three more break points.</p>
      <p>A sublime backhand and exquisite drop shot set up Federer’s 10th break point, however, and this time he took advantage to draw level at 2-2.</p>
      <p>Tsitsipas broke back immediately though and two overhit efforts put Federer two games down.</p>
      <p>Another strong hold of serve put Tsitsipas on the brink, and – despite some nervy shots on his last service game – a thumping ace secured a deserved victory.</p>
