      <p>Shami’s destructive bowling in the second innings – following up on his first innings haul of 3/27 – helped India canter to a win by an innings and 130 runs.</p>
      <p>Speaking after the match, former India cricketers <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/gautam-gambhir/">Gautam Gambhir</a> and Sunil Gavaskar lavished praise on the speedster. Gambhir said he is the best Test ball bowler in the world at the moment, while Gavaskar said Shami reminds him of Malcolm Marshall.</p>
      <p>“At the moment, colour doesn’t matter to him. Give him the yellow ball… give him the pink ball… he is going to be the leader of the attack. He probably is the best red-ball bowler in the world,” Gambhir said on the broadcasting channel’s post-match show.</p>

      <p>Gavaskar said, “Clive Llyod gave the new ball to Malcolm Marshall and he picked 30 wickets because he had that ability. Mohammed Shami is like Malcolm Marshall is some sense. His delivery also comes at you like a missile. Same kind of late inward and outward movement. Very very difficult to negotiate.”</p>
      <p>South Africa pace merchant <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/dale-steyn/">Dale Steyn</a> went to the extent of calling Shami the best bowler, across formats, in the world at the moment.</p>
