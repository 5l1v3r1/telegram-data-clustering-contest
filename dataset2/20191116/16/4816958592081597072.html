      <p>BEIRUT — Lebanon’s bank staff union will meet on Sunday or Monday to decide whether to call off a strike, after receiving a plan to secure banks with a stepped up police presence, the president of the Federation of Syndicates of Bank Employees said on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The union began the strike on Tuesday over safety fears, as protests against political leaders sweep Lebanon and depositors demand access to their money after banks imposed new curbs.</p>
      <p>George al-Hajj said banks could re-open as early as Monday if the union agrees that the plan is satisfactory. Hajj expressed support for the plan but said there was not yet a final decision.</p>
      <p>It calls for police officers to guard select branches and provides a hotline for banks to call in immediate security assistance if needed.</p>
