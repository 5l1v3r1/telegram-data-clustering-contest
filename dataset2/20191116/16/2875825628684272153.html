      <h1>Sara Wallis: The Cockfields on Gold could be a new classic to rival great sitcoms</h1>
      <h2>Co-written by 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown's Joe Wilkinson, mundane conversations make for a sparkling script and the tender moments are reminiscent of The Royle Family</h2>

      <p>From Sue Johnston fussing over spare pillows to Bobby Ball glued to The Chase, The Cockfields was the injection of big-hearted ­comedy I didn’t even realise I’d been waiting for.</p>
      <p>Sitcoms are a tough sell these days. There’s just so much to live up to so we keep banging on about Fawlty Towers and Blackadder.</p>
      <p>If only we had something else to talk about.</p>
      <p>The Cockfields on Gold is co-written and stars Joe Wilkinson, who I knew only as that bloke who performs idiotic sketches on 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown.</p>
      <p>What a surprise then that he has penned with David Earl this gentle family comedy that gave me all the feels of that other ­classic: The Royle Family.</p>
      <p>It follows a family, no more normal or weird than anyone’s, who mostly sit around on a sofa irritating the hell out of each other.</p>

      <p>No big twists, no levered-in ­slapstick, just people being people.</p>
      <p>Joe plays Simon, heading back to his family home on the Isle of Wight with his girlfriend Donna, Motherland’s Diane Morgan, to spend a long weekend with his overbearing relatives for his 40th.</p>
      <p>Doting mum Sue, played by Royles veteran Johnston, is a delight, obsessing, as mums do, over pointless details.</p>

      <h3>Twitchy</h3>
      <p>Do they need spare duvets, more pie? Should they eat lunch in the garden? What about midges? Napkins?</p>
      <p>Donna’s facial expressions grow more and more twitchy.</p>
      <p>Sue’s husband Ray, played by Ball, just wants to eat his sandwich – white slice, plastic cheese, while watching TV.</p>

      <p>Simon’s awkward stepbrother David, played by Ben Rufus Green, is obsessed with having selfies with celebrities.</p>
      <p>One “tense” scene saw the family sitting outside the closed gate of what they ­believed was Alan Titchmarsh’s home.</p>
      <p>“We saw him in Morrisons down one of the aisles,” said Sue proudly.</p>
      <p>Mundane conversations about the neighbour’s hedge and the price of an organic sausage roll made for a sparkling script.</p>

      <p>There were tender moments too. Sue taking a moment to tell Simon how as a four-year-old he’d promised her he’d stay four for ever.</p>
      <p>And of course, the relatives everyone loves to hate.</p>
      <p>Simon’s dad Larry, played by Nigel Havers, who produced a revolting red leather jacket as his birthday gift.</p>
      <p>Sarah Parish as Larry’s obnoxious snob girlfriend Melissa, who “doesn’t want to make a fuss”.</p>
      <p>And the neighbour always lurking, getting smashed on white wine.</p>
      <p>Just three parts, this wasn’t enough for me.</p>
      <p>But with a couple of neat plot moves at the end – a possible proposal and Ray’s dodgy heart – the writers must be busy scribbling a full series.</p>
      <p>We all need a new classic.</p>
