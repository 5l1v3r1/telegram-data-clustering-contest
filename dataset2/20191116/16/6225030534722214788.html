      <p>Marie Trombetta’s <b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/Newstome">Newstome</a></b> slipped through an opening along the rail in deep stretch to pass pacesetter Reform School and hold off a late rush from Informative on the outside for a popular nose triumph in Saturday’s $100,000 <b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/race/2019_James_F_Lewis_III_Stakes">James F. Lewis III</a></b> at Laurel Park.<br/>The eighth running of the Lewis for 2-year-olds shared top billing with the 23rd renewal of the $100,000 Warrior’s Reward Smart Halo for 2-year-old fillies on the Military Family Appreciation Day program.<br/>Ridden by Trevor McCarthy for trainer Mike Trombetta, Newstome ($5.60) ran six furlongs in 1:10.65 over a fast main track as the 9-5 favorite to earn his second stakes win in four career starts and first on the dirt. He captured the Mark McDermott Stakes over Presque Isle Downs’ synthetic surface in his prior start Oct. 16.<br/>“It’s a cool feeling,” said Mike Trombetta, who has another stakes-winning 2-year-old in Independence Hall who's considered the early Kentucky Derby favorite.</p>
      <p>As for Newstome, “I’ve been terribly unfair to him. He’s run on a different surface every time he’s run. He’s four starts into his career and he hasn’t run on the same surface two times in a row.”<br/>Under McCarthy for the first time, Newstome settled in fourth as 30-1 long shot Reform School, shipping in from Charles Town, was quickest from the gate and went the opening quarter-mile in 22.87 seconds and a half in 46.40. McCarthy stayed patient awaiting room as Reform School turned for home and opened up, but Newstome continued to grind along the rail and got up in the final strides.<br/>“He broke really well for me today and the speed horse who I thought would go to the lead went to the lead and we were able to save all the ground and get a nice covered-up trip,” McCarthy said. “Turning for home I was little worried that [Reform School] got away from me but he was very game. Every time I asked him for more, he just kept giving.”<br/>Informative swung three wide to edge Reform School by a half-length for second. Sir Back in Black was third, followed by stakes winner Raging Whiskey and Bernie’s On Fire. Tuggle, the 3-1 program favorite, and Ain’t Wasting Time were scratched.<br/>Newstome is a Pennsylvania-bred son of Goldencents out of the Unbridled’s Song mare Newstouse who the Trombetta’s purchased for $30,000 out of Fasig-Tipton’s Midlantic 2-year-olds in training sale in May. He debuted with a maiden special weight win over the Parx dirt Aug. 3, then was seventh behind subsequent Futurity (G3) and Breeders’ Cup Juvenile Turf Sprint (G1) winner Four Wheel Drive in the Rosie’s Stakes on the grass at Colonial Downs.<br/>“We picked him out at the 2-year-old sale at Timonium, and he’s been a tremendous amount of fun,” Mike Trombetta said. “He was just put together well. He’s not a real big horse but he’s an athletic type. He had a good breeze for the sale and, quite frankly, he was priced right.”<br/>The James F. Lewis III is named for the late longtime horseman who served as first president of Maryland Million Ltd. and past president of the Maryland Horse Breeders Association. A breeder, owner and trainer, Lewis’ top horses included 1974 Test (G2) winner Maybellene, 1974 Flirtation (G3) winner Heartful and multiple stakes winner Swift Attraction. His daughter, Lisa Lewis, has been training since 1989.</p>
