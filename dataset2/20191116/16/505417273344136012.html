      <h1>Stuart Hogg Executes Inch Perfect Kick That Leads To Exeter Try</h1>

        <b>Stuart Hogg is really making his presence felt with his new club.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The international full-back linked up with new side Exeter Chiefs following Scotland’s disappointing Rugby World Cup campaign and is today making his <a href="https://twitter.com/ChampionsCup">Champions Cup</a> debut with the English Premiership side.</p>
      <p>Exeter currently lead La Rochelle, led by Ronan O’Gara, 14-0 following a try from Dave Dennis. However, the score came as a result of one of the most perfect kicks you are ever likely to see on a rugby pitch from Hogg.</p>
      <p>Check it out below:</p>

      <p>Exter eventually scored their second try before half-time when Joe Simmonds set up Tom O’Flaherty to score.</p>
      <p>Difficult to choose which was better though. Simmonds’ pass or O’Flaherty’s finish.</p>
