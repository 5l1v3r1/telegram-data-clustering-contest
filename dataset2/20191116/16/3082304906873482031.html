        <b>It has been reported that La Liga giants Barcelona and Serie A side Inter Milan have entered talks with each other, for the sale of Barca’s star right-back Nelson Semedo.</b>
      </p>
      <p>This is according to the Italian publication <i><a href="https://sempreinter.com/2019/11/16/di-marzio-inter-barcelona-have-met-to-talk-about-summer-transfer-window/">SempreInter</a></i>, who claims that Gianluca Di Marzio, a reporter for <i>Sky Sports Italia</i>, revealed that Inter and Barcelona are keen to do business with each other during the upcoming summer transfer window.</p>
      <p>“A month ago, Inter and Barcelona met to start drafting up deals for next summer. From now to June, Inter and Barcelona will strike a deal, but they are trying to figure out who the players will be,” Di Marzio was quoted as saying.</p>
      <p>“Barcelona wants to sell Ivan Rakitic and sign Lautaro Martinez from Inter, but the Croatian is not a player that Antonio Conte likes and the Argentine is not on the market,” he further added, before concluding:</p>
      <p>“Then there is Arturo Vidal, however Giuseppe Marotta (Inter Milan CEO) is not convinced about him and is mindful of some off-field issues the Chilean has. There will be deals involving other players maybe Nelson Semedo.”</p>
      <p>Semedo has played 16 games for the Blaugranas this season – 12 of those appearances coming in the La Liga and four in the Champions League.</p>
      <p>In September, the Portuguese star was injured during the international break, but he returned to the Catalans’ first-team quite quickly. However, he is still not a key part of Ernesto Valverde’s plans this season.</p>
