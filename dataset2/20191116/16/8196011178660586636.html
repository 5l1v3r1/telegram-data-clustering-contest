      <p>Blackrock 0-15 - 1-10 Cloughduv</p>
      <p>Blackrock won this Cork IHC final, edging out Cloughduv in a disappointing game in Pairc Ui Rinn.</p>
      <p>Blackrock defended the scoreboard end in the first half but Brian Verling (free) opened the scoring early on for Cloughduv. Eoin O’Farrell (65) replied but Sean O’Connor nudged the mid-Cork side one ahead by the 10th minute.</p>
      <p>Both sides were trying to find their range early on but O’Farrell pushed Blackrock ahead with four frees by the 18th minute, 0-5 to 0-2, and Cloughduv ‘keeper Jonathan Buckley had to look sharp to save from Liam O’Sullivan’s close-range effort.</p>
      <p>Brian Verling added another free on 23 minutes but Colin O’Leary replied for Blackrock; Joe Ryan cracked over a Cloughduv point and the game began to warm up. Brian Verling’s first from play cut the deficit to one.</p>
      <p>In injury time Cloughduv won a penalty, but Brian Verling put it wide: their ninth of the half, leaving the score 0-6 to 0-5 at the half.</p>
      <p>O’Farrell pointed from the wing to start the second half. Cloughduv’s Donal Corkery thought he had a goal soon afterwards but the whistle had already blown for a Blackrock free.</p>
      <p>Verling brought Cloughduv level with two frees and finally nudged his side ahead with yet another free turning into the final quarter - but O’Farrell (free) equalised almost immediately.</p>
      <p>Diarmuid Cormack’s long-range point was followed by another two from O’Farrell, pushing Blackrock three ahead, 0-11 to 0-8.</p>
      <p>On 48 minutes Donal O’Mahony saved well from Mark Verling but Cloughduv won a second penalty in the ensuing scramble: O’Mahony saved Brian Verling’s shot and Blackrock escaped again.</p>
      <p>Mark O’Keeffe made it a four-point game with six minutes left but Verling (free) responded.</p>
      <p>O’Farrell restored that four point gap with another free but Blackrock needed another good O’Mahony save from Mark Verling to hold out.</p>
      <p>Brian Verling made it a three point game in injury time but late scores by David Cashman and Olan Kelleher made it safe for Blackrock.</p>
      <p>Deep in injury time Cloughduv won yet another penalty: Mark Verling took this one and buried it.</p>
