      <p>The latest game which the team over at Digital Foundry has tackled is the newly released <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/?s=Pokemon+Sword+%26+Shield">Pokemon Sword &amp; Shield</a> for the Nintendo Switch platform. The summary to take away here is that technically it doesn’t quite live up to expectations as the first next generation Pokemon game for the Nintendo Switch. However, that’s from a technical perspective and I’m sure many of you are enjoying it. Here’s a full summary thanks to <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/df-pok%C3%A9mon-sword-shield-switchs-next-gen-pok%C3%A9mon-doesnt-quite-deliver.153431/">Reset Era member Joseki</a>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Engine is an evolved version of Let’s Go.</li>
        <li>Wild Area is big, surprisingly high foliage density and nice bloom effect.</li>
        <li>City design more in line with Sun and Moon’s standard than Let’s Go “grid based” design.</li>
        <li>Locked camera in city helps performance.</li>
        <li>Shadows improved over Sun and Moon, now proper shadows are present outside of battles too.</li>
        <li>Over 400 Pokémon cut, Z-moves, Mega and many online features are removed for increased quality…</li>
        <li>… but environments are mostly static (“window dressing”), huge repetition of rooms and decorations.</li>
        <li>Texturing is generally of poor quality highlighted by the low camera angle.</li>
        <li>Dynamic shadow system is impressive, but it has a lot of flickering. It can look rough.</li>
        <li>Pop-in is a huge issue, rendering range is extremely limited and almost comical.</li>
        <li>Human character higher detailed than ever, but contrary to Game Freak’s pre release statements the Pokémon models were not reworked.</li>
        <li>Lighting and material interactions are sensibly increased over the 3DS, but it does not explain the huge cut of Dex. Why are Pokémon from Let’s Go missing if they were already reworked?</li>
        <li>Compared to BotW and Xenoblade 2, the game is “in a lower league”.</li>
        <li>Docked res: 1080p indoor, dynamic res outsidide (864p worse case scenario). Game is more demanding than Let’s Go so it justifies the lower res.</li>
        <li>Portable res: 720p dynamic, drops at 576p outdoor worst case scenario.<br/>– Zero AA</li>
        <li>No graphical differences between portable and docked.</li>
        <li>Performance is 30 fps and it’s stable most of the time. Switching into battles momentarily drops the framerate in the 20s and dynamax battles can drop too.</li>
        <li>Positives: environments, engine cutscenes</li>
        <li>Negatives: emptiness of the world, pop-in, removal of many Pokémon</li>
        <li>Overall: a step forward, but the pop-in is a glaring issue and it doesn’t fully matches the expectations of a next gen Pokémon game, and the Pokédex cut is a big limitation.</li>
      </ul>
