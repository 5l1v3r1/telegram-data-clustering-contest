      <p>The professional dancer, 29, used Gemma's 35th birthday as an excuse to post a never-before-seen snap of their newborn baby - who they welcomed in July - alongside a gushing caption about his sweetheart.</p>
      <p>The rare image showed blonde Gemma planting a kiss on baby Mia's cheek as she cradled her in her arms.</p>
      <p>Gym bunny Gemma rocked a black sports bra and leggings with her hair up in a casual bun.</p>

      <p>Praising her parenting, he continued: "To the best mummy thank you for growing our gorgeous daughter inside of you and bringing her safely and healthily into this world.</p>

      <p>Sharing his thoughts on the future, he added: "Can’t wait to spend the rest of our lives by each others sides seeing our little one grow and celebrate more birthdays together. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH MY WORLD @glouiseatkinson."</p>
      <p>The happy couple met on the 2017 series of Strictly when they were partnered with different people, but that didn't stop their love from blossoming.</p>
      <p>Gemma had even joked that she'd happily welcome the infamous Strictly Curse if it meant she could find a man - and on Valentine's Day 2018, the pair finally went public with their romance.</p>
      <p>Gemma took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> to break the news, sharing a romantic sun-soaked picture of them on holiday together looking gorgeous in their swimwear.</p>

      <p>"Here's to many more kid. Happy Valentines Day Gorka Marquez," she gushed.</p>
      <p>By Christmas of that year, the couple were serious, with Gorka taking her to his native Bilbao to meet his whole family.</p>
      <p>And in February this year, the pair revealed they were expecting their first baby together with a sweet snap of Gemma's dogs Ollie and Norman proudly declaring they were set to become big brothers.</p>
