      <h2>The line-up of this year's I'm A Celebrity certainly don't have their work cut out for them - half the chores they're meant to do are already sorted by producers</h2>

      <p>The cast of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! 2019 are all in the camp now - but unlike in previous years, they're set to have a relatively easy time of things.</p>
      <p>Because this year's camp comes with a shakeup amid problems in Australia and an outcry over previous series of the ITV show.</p>
      <p>Mirror Online can reveal that not only will the campmates be given an easy ride with their Bushtucker trials - there's now a ban on the eating of live animals, meaning the days of having to crunch down on twitching witchetty grubs are gone - but there aren't even that many chores to do.</p>

      <p>There's also a ban on the lighting of a campfire for the first time in the history of the show, given that vast areas of the state of New South Wales are on fire thanks to unprecedented wildfires.</p>
      <p>Instead, the celebs will have to cook their food on a gas stove to limit the risk of another blaze.</p>
      <p>"In light of the current situation in Australia, I'm A Celebrity will not feature an open camp fire," an ITV spokesman said this week.</p>
      <p>"Instead, campmates will cook their food and boil their water on a specially made gas stove."</p>

      <p>However, there won't even be much boiling of water, as there's a special tank installed in the camp where they can draw their drinking water without having to faff around with heating up the stove.</p>
      <p>And while this year there's no need for them to use firewood, in previous series the chopping has already been done for them by staff, who leave handy piles of the fuel lying around so the stars can just pick it up pre-chopped and haul it back to camp.</p>
      <p>The worst part of the camp has to be the dunny, where the celebs do their business.</p>
      <p>But while much has been made of the poor star who gets the raw end of the deal, the toilet is actually emptied for them by production runners, who take the bucket to another location where it is picked up, cleaned and returned.</p>

      <p>One thing that is just as true in real life as is shown on TV is the tiny amount of food the celebs receive daily.</p>
      <p>Unless they win stars in their challenges, each of the campmates are on basic rations of rice and beans - which can lead to exhaustion.</p>
      <p>Sometimes they get given electrolyte drinks and glucose to keep them going, but most of the time they'll lay around the camp to conserve their energy.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/im-celebrity-2017-secrets-revealed-9126670">Medic Bob told the Mirror</a> in previous years that he's had to administer emergency supplements to some of the celebs.</p>

      <p>"I mean there's been a couple, I can't mention it medically, but there's been a couple that have had a few dizzy spells and we've given them some electrolyte drinks and some glucose," he said in 2017.</p>
      <p>"They're very hungry, really hungry. They're very hungry at the moment, they haven't done quite so well at the trials lately.</p>
      <p>"If you could see how much rice and beans they get per person, per day, I think you'd be quite shocked. The little bit of rice is quite tiny and the little bit of beans is quite tiny."</p>
