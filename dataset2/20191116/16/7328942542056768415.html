      <p>Ever wondered how food processing works? You probably know that the foods on the market shelves aren't made by people with their bare hands. If they did, it'd take a long time and the prices would be higher, obviously. But then how does it work?</p>
      <p>How is the food we see in the markets made? How do they prepare our favorite chocolate, the cake we always buy, or the ice cream we go for all the time?</p>
      <p>

      <p>Well, with the technology we have today, it's not so difficult to make it all within seconds with machines which would take longer if humans made the same.</p>
      <p>Here are seven wonders of processing that will show you how the foods are made. </p>
      <h3>1. <a href="https://www.unifiller.com/">Unifller Cake Finishing Equipment</a></h3>
      <p>Without a doubt, you wonder how your favorite cake in the market is made and it tastes the same every time. Well, wonder no more. With this cake finishing equipment, it's easy to create the same delicious cake all the time. Yeah, it may be difficult to make the same cake without a mistake if it was made by humans, but technology never fails to succeed, or at least in food processing.</p>

      <h3>2. <a href="https://handtmann.us/">Handtman PVLH241 Sausage Making Machine</a></h3>
      <p>With this machine, it's much easier to make both cooked sausage or dry ones like mini-salami. Of course, sausages or salami don't come in the shape you're familiar with. They need a long process to end up with the shape you're familiar with. And once again, humans would take longer to create it, but with this machine, it becomes easier and less time-consuming, also the margin of error of a machine is less than a human being.</p>

      <h3>3. <a href="https://egg-breakers.com/">Egg Breaker OVO-tech</a> </h3>
      <p>You must be familiar with the fuss of breaking eggs and separating yolks from whites. And maybe you wonder how they do it in big factories. Do a group of people come together and while some of them are breaking eggs, the rest of them are separating the yolks and the whites. Well, not really. Mostly thanks to these kinds of machines, it's much easier to do it. This machine can wash, disinfect, and break <b>25,600</b> eggs per hour. Crazy, isn't it?</p>

      <h3>4. <a href="https://www.weberslicer.com/">Weber SmartLoader Side Loading System</a></h3>
      <p>This machine is an automatic side loading system for single products or individual portions. It can be used for sliced products and it can be combined with different types of slicers and portioners. So again, we have the technology for everything, even for grouping the products, which can be done by humans. But again, since machines are faster, why bother humans, right?</p>
