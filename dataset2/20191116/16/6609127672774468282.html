        <b>SCOTLAND sealed a double over Cyprus as they clinched victory in Nicosia this evening.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ryan Christie and John McGinn scored to <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4961580/cyprus-1-scotland-2-john-mcgin-ryan-christie/">help the national side secure a 2-1 win</a>.</p>

      <p>The victory lifts <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/298595/scotland-football-team/">Steve Clarke's men</a> into third place in Group I in the Euro 2020 qualifiers.</p>
      <p>And the manager will be happy with what he saw from his players today as they look to build momentum ahead of the play-offs in March.</p>
      <p>The Wigan No1 was a relieved man when Cyprus were denied a perfectly good goal after six minutes. But Marsh was helpless at the goal he conceded with the volley just too good. <b>7</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>LIAM PALMER</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sheffield Wednesday defender is fast becoming Scotland’s first choice right-back. Unlucky with a first-half shot which was deflected wide. Overall this was a sound performance. <b>8</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>DECLAN GALLAGHER</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14921/motherwell/">Motherwell</a> centre back was handed his Scotland debut at the ripe age of 28 having been a standout performer at Fir Park this season. Stood up to physicality of Cyprus and handled threat well. <b>7</b></p>

        <b>SCOTT McKENNA</b>
      </p>
      <p>The big <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14898/aberdeen/">Aberdeen</a> defender returned to the Scotland team after an injury lay-off which saw him sit out the four previous qualifiers. Gave away the free-kick which led to equaliser because of a poor touch. <b>6</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>GREG TAYLOR</b>
      </p>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14919/kilmarnock/">Kilmarnock</a> left-back has been bit-part player at Celtic this season but Steve Clarke clearly trusts him having worked with him during his time at Rugby Park. Got forward well with good assist for McGinn winner. <b>8</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>RYAN JACK</b>
      </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14923/rangers/">Rangers</a> star has been biding his time to make a Scotland start but his club performances this season made his selection a no brainer. Here he continued his top form with another disciplined display in the middle of the park. <b>8</b></p>

        <b>CALLUM McGREGOR</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Celtic</a> star never lets anyone down and this was another display which only enhanced his reputation. Busy off the ball and assured on it. Always played with his head up looking for a forward pass. Just as he always does. <b>8</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>RYAN CHRISTIE</b>
      </p>
      <p>Played on the right and made intelligent runs inside. At fault for the Cyprus ‘goal’ which didn’t count with a half-hearted challenge in the build-up - but Celtic star’s strike for the opener was sensational. Never stopped running. <b>8</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>JOHN McGINN</b>
      </p>
      <p>Played behind frontman Steven Naismith and his energy to close down defenders out of possession was a big plus for Scotland. This position suits the Aston Villa star down to the ground. Winner takes his tally to 5 in 5. <b>8</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>JAMES FORREST</b>
      </p>
      <p>Wore the No7 shirt but given a role on the left where he went at his man from the get-go, winning a corner after only 19 seconds of the game kicking off. Subbed after 70 minutes with job done.<b> 7</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>STEVEN NAISMITH</b>
      </p>
      <p>Made his 50th cap as skipper and you could see what it meant to him. But his pride came before a fall. The <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14918/hearts/">Hearts</a> star was subbed after an hour after twisting awkwardly on the turf. <b>7</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>SUBS</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>OLI McBURNIE</b> (<b>3</b>) replaced Steven Naismith on the hour mark but didn’t do much to catch the eye . <b>OLI BURKE</b> (<b>3</b>) got the final 20 minutes and did okay. <b>MIKEY DEVLIN</b> (<b>1</b>) only given final few seconds.</p>
