      <p>When you have plantar fasciitis, working on your feet for a few hours or more each day can be uncomfortable. Fortunately, by wearing one of the <a href="https://fixmywalk.com/best-shoes-for-plantar-fasciitis/">best work shoes for plantar fasciitis</a>, you can minimize pain as much as possible during your work hours. According to Michigan-based podiatrist <a href="https://www.stopfeetpainfast.com/">Dr. Anthony Weinert</a>, there are several key features to look for in a pair of potential work shoes for plantar fasciitis:</p>
      <p>Dr. Weinert tells Bustle, look for “one that has a good arch support to help support the medial column of the foot and prevent the stretching of the plantar fascia upon ambulation. I would also get a shoe with either gel or memory foam to help provide good shock absorption to the heel and foot."</p>
      <p>If you prefer or are required to wear heels to work, then it's important to choose a pair with a low height and a wedge shape or a thicker heel, says Dr. Weinert, since this will provide the foot with more stability and put less strain on the plantar fascia. "In addition, I would wear a heel shoe that has a nice contoured arch and foot bed for extra stability," he adds.</p>
