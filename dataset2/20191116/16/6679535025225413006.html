      <h1>Panasonic Open | Shiv Kapur shares lead with two Aussies</h1>
      <h2>Cut at one-under leaves 30 Indians in the fray</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T16:15:37+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 16:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Rakesh-Rao-232/" target="_blank">Rakesh Rao</a></address>
      <p>In-form Shiv Kapur was with Aussies Adam Blyth and Terry Pilkadaris atop the leaderboard as the $400,000 Panasonic Open headed for a thrilling finish here.</p>
      <p>On a breeze-swept Classic Golf and Country Club course, when the players found it tough to control the ball during the second half of Saturday, early-starter Blyth shot an incredible, bogey-free nine-under 63 — one off the course record — to go 10-under.</p>
      <p>Shiv Kapur, involved in a playoff in the Thailand Open last Sunday, again moved into title-contention following a successive 67. After sinking five birdies from around six feet for a 32 on the front-nine, Kapur could only add one birdie on the back-nine.</p>
      <p>Pilkadaris shot a 68 to make it a three-man leaders’ pack at 134 — two better than Chinese Taipei’s Hung Chien-Yao and three-time runner-up Bangladesh’s Siddikur Rahman.</p>
      <p>Young Kshitij Naveed Kaul, joint leader on reaching under-10 after eight holes, dramatically dropped five shots on the next 10 holes to finish the second and penultimate round at even-par.</p>
      <p>What hurt Kaul’s prospects were the two double-bogeys — on the 13th and 18th holes. Effectively, Kaul’s front-nine 32 stood undone by the back-nine 40.</p>
      <p>The cut came at one-under 143 and left 67 professionals, including 30 Indians. Former champions Chiragh Kumar and Digvijay Singh along with Arjun Atwal missed the ‘cut’.</p>
