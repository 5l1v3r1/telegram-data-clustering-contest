      <p>If you’re looking for a seasonal album with a touch of class, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;q=Echoes+of+Swing%3A+Winter+Days+at+Schloss+Elmau">this</a> is it. <a href="https://echoesofswing.com/en/">Echoes of Swing</a> are a quartet who take delight in exploring new approaches to classic jazz styles. The results are unfailingly witty, affectionate and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/01/echoes-of-swing-dancing-review-act-pinpoint-accuracy-and-tonal-delicacy">faultlessly played</a>. They are based in Germany, have been together for more than 20 years and have a keen following in Europe. This time, to their trumpet, alto saxophone, piano and drums they have added double bass, guitar and, most importantly, the voice of American vocalist <a href="http://www.rebeccakilgore.com/">Rebecca Kilgore</a>.</p>
      <p>The programme, with a winter theme, is a mixture of old favourites, such as Winter Wonderland (disconcertingly recast in 5/4 time), settings of poems (Robert Frost, Emily Brontë, Shakespeare), some originals and a few rarities by Antônio Carlos Jobim, Burt Bacharach and others. The arrangements are imaginative, the solos brief and to the point, and Kilgore handles a bewildering variety of material with impressive poise. It adds up to a delightful 50-odd minutes, and you don’t have to be a jazz buff to enjoy it, just reasonably musical. Schloss Elmau, by the way, is a <a href="https://www.schloss-elmau.de/en/">spa and “cultural hideaway”</a> in the Bavarian Alps.</p>
