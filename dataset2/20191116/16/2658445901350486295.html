      <p>James, who also commended the conduct of the Nigerian Army personnel, described it as the “most peaceful”.</p>

      <p>“I give INEC 90 per cent in the distribution of non-sensitive and sensitive materials; it has been orderly and smooth.</p>
      <p>“I also commend the military because they really did their work according to the rules of engagement.</p>
      <p>“Today’s election is among the most peaceful election in the history of Bayelsa.</p>
      <p>“I observed the process at Nembe, Ward 2, polling unit 2, 3,6, 11, and 12. I also observed in Ward 1, polling unit 10.</p>
      <p>“Other areas I visited include Nembe-Basangbiri, ward 5, unit 1, 2, 5 and ward 4 all in Nembe local government area of Bayelsa.</p>
      <p>“My suggestion for INEC in case of next election should improve in area logistics for the police and other security agencies.”</p>
