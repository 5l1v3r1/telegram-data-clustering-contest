      <p>Microsoft removed a compatibility hold caused by outdated Realtek Bluetooth drivers and published a support document describing a workaround designed to help Windows 10 users still affected by the safeguard hold.</p>
      <p>Users of still impacted devices will receive a "Realtek Bluetooth: Your PC has a driver or service that isn't ready for this version of windows 10. A new version is available" error message when attempting to update to Windows 10 version 1909, version 1903, or version 1809.</p>
      <p>The safeguard hold was added by Microsoft in May 2019 after acknowledging an issue where <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/windows-10-may-2019-update-blocked-by-old-bluetooth-drivers/">computers with Realtek Bluetooth radios experienced problems</a> when discovering and connecting to Bluetooth devices after installing or updating to Windows 10, version 1903 due to outdated drivers.</p>
      <p>"You will need to update to driver version 1.5.1012 or later to remove this safeguard hold," says Microsoft. "Any earlier version of the driver is affected by this issue."</p>

      <h3>Update block removed, workaround available</h3>
      <p>Microsoft <a href="http://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-information/status-windows-10-1909#225msgdesc">says</a> that the known issue was resolved with an updated driver for the affected Realtek Bluetooth radio and the compatibility hold was removed on November 15.</p>
      <p>To update your Windows 10 device to the 1909 or 1903 versions you should first try manually checking for the update and install the new Realtek Bluetooth drivers if they are being offered. You will be able to install the Windows 10 update after the driver update.</p>
      <p>However, "it can take up to 48 hours before you can update to offered Windows 10, version 1909 or Windows 10, version 1903" <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4529832/updating-to-windows-10-version-1903-on-devices-with-some-driver-versio">according</a> to Redmond.</p>
      <p>Users that won't be offered the new Realtek Bluetooth drivers when checking for Windows updates will have to download and install them manually by going through the following step-by-step procedure:</p>
      <p>• Download both of the Realtek Bluetooth radio drivers to your preferred folder: <a href="http://download.windowsupdate.com/d/msdownload/update/driver/drvs/2019/01/f2748416-7753-49c6-9185-56f4986f490b_e98e0d664b7e874011b8e3752046ca61f3475295.cab">Driver 1</a>, <a href="http://download.windowsupdate.com/c/msdownload/update/driver/drvs/2018/11/068de0d6-6ac2-473a-8cbd-bd449cd5c97c_942eec5828662eecc6b98cc2706658bf2433717c.cab">Driver 2</a>. <b>Note: </b>We recommend downloading them to your <b>Documents </b>folder.<br/>• Open <b>File Explorer</b>.

This should select all of the files<br/>• Right click or long press on any of the files and select <b>Extract</b>.<br/>• If you are in the folder named <b>Realtek Bluetooth</b>, then select the <b>New folder </b>button and type <b>Realtek Bluetooth 2</b>.<br/>• Select the <b>Extract </b>button.<br/>• In the search box on the taskbar, enter <b>device manager</b>, then select<b> Device Manager</b>.<br/>• Find <b>Bluetooth</b> and expand it.<br/>• Find the Realtek device and right-click or long press on it.<br/>• Select <b>Update Driver</b> from the context menu.<br/>• Select the <b>Browse my computer for driver software </b>button.<br/>• It should default to your <b>Documents </b>folder, if this is where you saved the drivers then just select the <b>Next </b>button. If you did not save the drivers to your <b>Documents </b>folder, select the <b>Browse</b> button and find the folder you downloaded the drivers to and select <b>OK</b>.<br/>• It should now find the updated drivers and install them. Wait for this to complete and select <b>Close</b>.</p>
      <p>Once you go through all the steps and complete the manual Bluetooth driver update procedure, the compatibility hold should be removed and you should be able to update to the latest Windows 10 version.</p>
      <h3>One safeguard hold still on for Windows 10 1909</h3>
      <p>Windows 10 devices are still blocked from installing the Windows 10, version 1909 update by a <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/windows-10-losing-connectivity-from-outdated-wi-fi-drivers/">safeguard hold put in place by Microsoft to prevent intermittent loss of Wi-Fi connectivity</a> on some older systems with outdated Qualcomm drivers.</p>
      <p>Microsoft provides a workaround for this known issue too, stating that users need to download and install updated Wi-Fi drivers from the manufacturer (OEM).</p>
      <p>Redmond advises impacted Windows users not to apply the Windows 10 November 2019 Update manually "using the Update now button or the Media Creation Tool" before updating their system's Qualcomm Wi-Fi drivers or having the update automatically provided through Windows Update.</p>
      <p>Windows 10 customers can also access info on how to <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/help/4089834">troubleshoot update problems</a> or <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors">fix Windows Update errors</a> on Microsoft's support website.</p>
      <p>Also, to make sure that a device is compatible with the latest Windows 10 version, users should read the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/design/minimum/windows-processor-requirements">Windows Processor Requirements</a> and the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-10-specifications">Windows 10 System Requirements</a>.</p>
