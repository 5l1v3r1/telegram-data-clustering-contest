      <p>Forget <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/04/hellboy-2019-movie-review.html">the swole Hellboy</a>: David Harbour (and David Harbour’s physique) will eternally be remembered as the <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2019/07/stranger-things-3-all-about-hoppers-floral-shirt.html">platonic #dadbod ideal</a> thanks to his prickly police-chief role in <i>Stranger Things. </i>He’ll also now be remembered as one of <i>People</i>’s <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/john-legend-wins-people-sexiest-man-alive-2019.html">Sexiest Men Alive</a> for 2019, which he’s thrilled about, even if he’s only (<i>only</i>) quarter-page sexy. Or 25 percent as sexy as Idris Elba. Or .05 percent as sexy as John Legend. It’s just the thought that counts. “I’m very excited for <i>People </i>Magazine, as next month they’re going to release Men Wandering Around Lower Manhattan’s Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Looking for the Perfect Dish Towel. I’m also in that as well,” he joked on <i>The Late Show. </i>“I’d also like to say I got Sexiest Man Alive when I got a full mustache and a 40-inch waist. So thank you, America.” No, we should be thanking you.</p>
