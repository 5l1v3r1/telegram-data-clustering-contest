      <h1>Fans At Mississippi State-Alabama Game Warned About Bats</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T16:37:50+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 16:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>As if facing an angry Alabama team wasn’t bad enough for Mississippi State, the football program will also have to deal with bats this afternoon. Yes, you read that correctly.</p>
      <p>The Crimson Tide and Bulldogs will battle in a little less than a hour. While the biggest storyline on the field has to do with the health of Tua Tagovailoa, this recent development involving bats has become the topic of conversation in Mississippi.</p>
      <p>Davis Wade Stadium shared an announcement that there are bats in the venue that are considered “high risk for rabies.”</p>
      <p>Alabama reporter Mike Rodak announced the news on Twitter.</p>

      <p>There are several jokes being made about this situation on social media, but it’s obviously not a laughing matter.</p>
      <p>Considering how important today’s game is for both teams, there should be a large amount of fans at the stadium. After all, the home crowd would love nothing more than to see an upset victory over the Crimson Tide.</p>
      <p>Hopefully everyone attending the game this afternoon stays safe and away from the rabies-infested bats.</p>
      <p>Kickoff for this game is at 12 p.m. E.T. from Davis Wade Stadium.</p>
