      <h1>NoiseBuddy: Control Noise Cancellation and Transparency Modes of AirPods Pro on a Mac</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T16:42:50+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 16:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macstories.net/author/johnvoorhees/" target="_blank">John Voorhees</a></address>
      <p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://twitter.com/_inside">Guilherme Rambo</a> released <a href="https://github.com/insidegui/NoiseBuddy">a new Mac utility called NoiseBuddy</a> that toggles between the noise cancellation and Transparency modes of AirPods Pro and the Beats Solo Pro headphones when they’re connected to a Mac. The app can place an icon in your Mac’s menu bar or on the Touch Bar and uses the same noise cancellation and Transparency iconography found in Control Center on iOS and iPadOS. The app’s settings allow you to run NoiseBuddy in the menu bar, on the Touch Bar, or in both places. To switch modes, simply click the icon in the menu bar or tap the Touch Bar button.</p>

      <p>This isn’t Rambo’s first time working with Bluetooth headphones and the Mac. He also created <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/airbuddy">AirBuddy</a>, which <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/airbuddy-an-airpods-companion-for-your-mac/">we covered previously</a>. AirBuddy is a Mac utility that displays the charge status of AirPods and Beats headphones that use Apple’s proprietary wireless chips. The app also allows users to connect those headphones to their Macs via Bluetooth with a single click.</p>

      <p>NoiseBuddy is the kind of Mac utility that I love. It takes overly fiddly aspect of interacting with macOS and makes it dead simple. The free app <a href="https://github.com/insidegui/NoiseBuddy">is available from Rambo’s GitHub repo</a>, where it can be downloaded as a ZIP archive and then dragged into your Applications folder.</p>
