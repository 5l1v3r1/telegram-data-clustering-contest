      <p>Olivia Colman has given her verdict on Gillian Anderson’s performance as Margaret Thatcher in The Crown season 4 – and she’s got the royal seal of approval.</p>
      <p>The Sex Education actress will be portraying the late Prime Minister in the next series of the show, which is currently filming.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Entertainment Weekly, the Oscar-winning star spoke about seeing Anderson channel the Iron Lady at a table read, and she definitely left a positive impression.</p>
      <p>‘The moment she opened her mouth in the read-through, you could feel everyone wanting to do a little silent “Yay!” because she was so brilliant,’ she said.</p>
      <p>‘She’s <i>amazing</i>,’ she added, to really hit the point home;</p>
      <p>We won’t see the X-Files icon as the Prime Minister, however, for quite some time as the third series of the programme (finally) drops this weekend.</p>

      <p>It comes at a particularly important time for the show too, as it has just replaced all its major stars.</p>

      <p>Colman and Helena Bonham Carter are taking over from Claire Foy and Vanessa Kirby respectively, whilst Matt Smith has passed the torch on to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/game-of-thrones/">Game Of Thrones</a>’ Tobias Menzies.</p>
      <p>The actresses will be portraying royal sisters Queen Elizabeth II and Princess Margaret.</p>
      <p>The next run of episodes will explore an ageing royal family, which will track the life of the queen from 1964 to 1970; with events including the Aberfan disaster in South Wales and the assassination of Lord Mountbatten.</p>
      <p>We’ll also see a more prominent role for the Prince of Wales in the new series, as he’s now aged up considerably and is played by God’s Own Country star Josh O’Connor.</p>
      <p>And the beginnings of Charles’s relationship with his now-wife Camilla Parker-Bowles will also be portrayed, although Princess Diana herself won’t be turning up until series four – which is filming now.</p>
