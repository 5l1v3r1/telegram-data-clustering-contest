      <p>The NYPD has not forgotten the miracle girl who <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/new-york-subway-dad-murder-suicide-mom-phone">survived her father’s suicide jump</a> in front of a moving Bronx subway train — and after spending Friday visiting police horses and boats and being sworn in as an honorary “officer,” she won’t soon forget them, either.</p>
      <p>“The horse and the boat!” shy Ferni Balbuena, 5, said of her favorite things from a daylong visit with the NYPD.</p>

      <p>“Ella estaba divertido!” her mother, Niurka Caraballo, said gratefully, over and over — Spanish for “She was happy!”</p>

      </p>
      <p>Ferni made dramatic headlines in September when her father, who’d been struggling with mental illness,<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/chilling-last-words-of-dad-who-jumped-in-front-of-train-with-daughter-in-arms"> jumped in front of a train</a> with her in his arms.</p>
      <p>Somehow, she survived virtually unscathed beneath the train, despite her father’s fatal injuries.</p>
      <p>On Friday, Ferni, who lives with her mother in the Bronx, was treated to a day of festivities courtesy of the NYPD’s “Hope Trip” program for children who have suffered traumatic incidents.</p>
