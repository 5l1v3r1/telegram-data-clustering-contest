      <h1>Lucas Torreira's agent admits he is unhappy with Unai Emery as he considers Arsenal exit</h1>
      <h2>The midfielder has been linked with a move back to Italy previously and has failed to hold down a regular starting berth at the Emirates this season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T16:08:22+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 16:08</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/lucas-torreira">Lucas Torreira</a> is unhappy with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> manager Unai Emery, according to the players' agent.</p>
      <p>The Uruguayan international has started just four Premier League games so far this season for the Gunners, and has seemingly been ousted from the defensive midfield role.</p>
      <p>Torreira was one of few positives to come out of last season for Arsenal, after impressing at the base of his team's midfield.</p>
      <p>However he is said to be annoyed at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/unai-emery">Emery</a> for changing his role and moving him into a more advanced position.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old has been linked with a a move away from the Emirates previously, and his agent Raffaele Bentancur did little to dispel any rumours.</p>

      <p>"Anything is possible in football," Bentancur told Radio Marte. "Torreira is happy at Arsenal, although the change in role has not made him happy.</p>
      <p>"It must be said that this year the whole team is not doing well. But I believe Arsenal wants to keep him."</p>
      <p>AC Milan are big admirers of Torreira, while Napoli tried to sign him in 2018 before he moved to England.</p>
      <p>Speaking of his lack of game time, Torreira said recently: "I don’t know whether I’d say it’s frustrating.</p>
      <p>“All players want to play, they obviously want to be in the starting XI – that’s completely normal.</p>

      <p>“But that’s not something that depends on me.</p>
      <p>“It’s down to the coach to make those decisions and really I have to respect that.</p>
      <p>“Right now it’s about not giving up.</p>
      <p>“You have to continue working hard and whether I’m playing in the starting XI or from the bench I want to give my all for the team."</p>
      <p>Torreira's Arsenal future could be affected by teammate Granit Xhaka, with the former captain looking likely to leave the club.</p>
      <p>Milan are interested in signing the Swiss star, which could put them off of a move for Torreira, but also open up more first-team opportunities for him.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> are also interested in offering Xhaka a Premier League lifeline and could make a loan bid for the midfielder in January.</p>
