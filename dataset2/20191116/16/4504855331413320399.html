      <h1>A young girl rescued from under a subway car is an honorary NYPD officer</h1>

      <p>(CNN) — A 5-year-old girl rescued from under a <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/us-world/father-dies-after-jumping-in-front-of-moving-train-while-holding-5-year-old-daughter/">subway train that killed her father</a> became an honorary New York Police Department officer.</p>
      <p>NYPD Chief of Patrol Rodney Harrison shared a photo of Ferni Balbuena Friday during her visit with the department.</p>
      <p>“Today is Ferni Balbuena’s #NYPD Hope Trip. Ferni was rescued unharmed last month after her father jumped onto the tracks with her. She found a few minutes to stop by my office before heading over to the Mounted Unit.”</p>
      <p>The Hope Program connects children who have suffered trauma or catastrophic illness with the police department.</p>
      <p>Ferni was in her father’s arms when he jumped in front of a subway train in September, witnesses said. Fernando Balbuena-Flores was killed, but bystanders helped to rescue the little girl.</p>
      <p>Cell phone footage taken from across the platform shows two men down on the tracks as the girl crawls out from under the train.</p>
      <p>“She was telling me, ‘What happened to my daddy?'” one of the men, identified as Jairo Torres, told CNN affiliate WCBS. “Then I said, ‘Don’t look at your daddy, come to me. Come like a puppy.'”</p>
      <p>On Friday, nearly two months later, she was sworn in as an honorary officer, NYPD Sgt. Jessica McRorie said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“Today, Deputy Chie John Clune swore in Ferni Balbuena as a honorary officer of the Hope Program,” McRorie said in a statement. “Hope stands for Heroism, Optimism, Pride and Encouragement.”</p>
