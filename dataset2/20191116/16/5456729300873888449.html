      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T16:27:10+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 16:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/nwest/363571-2020-hajj-board-asks-intending-katsina-pilgrims-to-deposit-n300000.html" target="_blank">Agency Report</a></address>
      <p>The Katsina State Pilgrims Welfare Board has directed intending pilgrims from the state to deposit N300,000 as initial deposit for 2020 Hajj.</p>
      <p>Acting Executive Director of the Board, Dalhatu Usman, announced this on Saturday in Katsina.</p>
      <p>“All intending pilgrims are free to start making deposits from November 2019 to March 2020,’’ he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Usman said intending pilgrims who have the capacity to pay lump sum of N1.5 million at once were free to do so, pending final announcement by National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON) on Hajj fares.</p>
      <p>The director said NAHCON has allocated 4,851 seats to the state for the 2020 Hajj.</p>
      <p>“I wish to call on all people in the state, willing to undertake 2020 Hajj, to obtain bank draft of N300,000 for deposit at zonal offices nearest to them.</p>
      <p>“All intending pilgrims must come with indigene letters from their respective local governments and obtain an e-passport from the Nigeria Immigration Service.</p>
      <p>“Female intending pilgrims must have Muharrams (brothers or husbands), who would also sign consent forms duly sworn to at Court of Law.</p>
      <p>“All intending pilgrims must have guarantors, who will stand as sureties, against absconding in Holy Land and the guarantor must be a respected person in the community,’’ he said.</p>
      <p>He advised all those willing to stand as guarantors to ensure that the persons they were guaranteeing were well known to them, as serious punishment await guarantors of absconders.</p>
      <p>Mr Usman appealed to the intending pilgrims to approach their zonal offices for payment of their deposits and warned that payments must be made in certified bank draft payable to Katsina State Pilgrim Welfare Board.</p>
      <p>The zonal offices were located in Daura, Katsina, Funtua, Malumfashi, Kankia, Mani and Dutsinma.</p>
