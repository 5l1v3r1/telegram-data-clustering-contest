      <p>Lewis Hamilton’s hopes of securing pole position for Sunday’s Brazilian Grand Prix were dealt a boost after he finished fastest in final practice.</p>
      <p>The world champion was only fifth here at Interlagos on Friday, but he returned to set the pace in the concluding running before the fight for pole.</p>
      <p>Hamilton saw off Red Bull’s Max Verstappen by just 0.026 seconds with Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc, who will serve a 10-place grid penalty following an engine change, in third.</p>

      <p>Sebastian Vettel finished fourth ahead of Red Bull’s Alex Albon and the Mercedes of Valtteri Bottas, who was sixth, almost a full second slower than his team-mate.</p>
      <p>Hamilton wrapped up his sixth title in Texas a fortnight ago, but the Briton will want to end his season with a flourish.</p>
      <p>And the 34-year-old appears to have the package underneath him to claim his fourth pole in Brazil.</p>
