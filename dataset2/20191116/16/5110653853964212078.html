      <p>Myles Garrett and Mason Rudolph exchanged in a heated interaction at the end of <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/steelers-browns-live-score-updates-highlights-thursday-night-football/r6xyx2seq57j1h7obct9hqik3">Thursday night's game between the Browns and Steelers</a>.</p>
      <p>Here's what happened:Garrett sacked Rudolph and held on to him for longer than he should have. Rudolph got upset with this, and an alternate camera angle shows the Steelers quarterback attempting to rip off Garrett's helmet. Garrettretaliates by successfully ripping off Rudolph's helmet.</p>
      <p>Garrett then proceeded to swing Rudolph's helmet at the Steelers quarterback, striking him in the back of the head. After this, some Steelers players bring Garrett to the ground and centerMaurkice Pouncey can be seen kicking at Garrett.</p>
      <p>Here are the videos of the incident.</p>

      <h3>How long will Myles Garrett be suspended?</h3>
      <p><b>UPDATE:</b> <a href="https://twitter.com/sportingnews/status/1195384676459921408">The NFL has suspended Garrett indefinitely.</a></p>
      <p>Fox Sports' <a href="https://twitter.com/getnickwright/status/1195335857135378434">Nick Wright</a>says according to a "more than reliable source" Garrett is looking at a "minimum of fourgames andmaximum of sixgames." A six-game suspension would mean Garrett would miss the rest of the 2019 season, which is something <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/nfl-must-suspend-myles-garrett-for-season-browns/w7pghbuu4l1t1e1y8s4eipa63">Sporting News' Bill Bender says should happen</a>.</p>
      <p>NFL Media's <a href="https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/1195343932055597057">Ian Rapoport</a> says the NFL has been reviewing the incident throughout the night and says to expect"significant repercussions" for Garrett. He also added a "potential multi-game suspension at the least" is expected for the Browns pass rusher.</p>
      <p>Rapoport cited the case of Albert Haynesworth stomping on the face ofAndre Gurode, which resulted in a five-game suspension.</p>
      <h3>Will anyone else will be suspended?</h3>
      <p><b>UPDATE:</b> Maurkice Pouncey has been suspended three games. Larry Ogunjobi has been suspended one game. The league added, "Additional discipline for other players will be forthcoming through the standard accountability process."</p>
      <p>Rapoport mentioned Steelers center Maurkice Pouncey and Browns defensive tackleLarry Ogunjobi as players who could possibly face suspensionsin addition to Garrett.Ogunjobi can be seen in the videos above shoving Rudolph to the ground after the quarterback was already hit in the head with his own helmet.</p>
      <p>Wright's report says "up to eightother players" are also "facing significant league discipline."</p>
      <p>Steelers offensive linemenMatt Feiler andDavid DeCastro were partially involved in the incident. Browns defensive endChris Smith was seen near the end. Rudolph could also be facing potentialdiscipline for his role as well.</p>

      <h3>Will Myles Garrett face legal action?</h3>
      <p><b>UPDATE:</b> NFL Network's Ian Rapoport, citing an unnamed source,<a href="https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/1195491413124952066">reported Friday night</a>on Twitter that Rudolph will not take legal action against Garrett. Rudolph considersthe incident "to be exclusively an NFL matter," per Rapoport's tweet.</p>
      <p>Rudolph's agent Tim Younger released a statement Friday morninghinting at potential legal action, saying in part, "the matter will be reviewed thoroughly."</p>

      <p>Younger also <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28086510/mason-rudolph-agent-no-legal-options-ruled-steelers-browns-fight">sent a statement to ESPN</a> confirming he hasn't ruled out legal action:"I am gathering all information and no options have been removed from the table."</p>
      <p>Cleveland Police <a href="https://twitter.com/TBarrabi/status/1195365413120610307">said</a> Friday morning, "There are no charges filed as there was no police report filed by the person hit with the helmet." However that just means Rudolph hasn't done anything yet. He still can press charges if he wants to.</p>
      <p>Legal action resulting from an on-field incident between players ata professional sporting event isn't unprecedented, but it's very rare and has never happened in the NFL. But at the same time, what Garrett did was alsounprecedented.</p>
      <p>As attorney Michael McCann <a href="http://www.si.com/nfl/2019/11/15/myles-garrett-mason-rudolph-browns-steelers-fight-legal-fallout?utm_campaign=themmqb&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=social">explained for Sports Illustrated</a>, thisbehavior has some intriguing elements from a law perspective:</p>
      <blockquote>Although unlikely, Garrett’s strike on Rudolph could have a legal fallout beyond the NFL. The strike appeared to meet the elements of the crime of assault. Like in other states, assault in Ohio refers to knowingly causing or attempting to cause physical harm on another person. Use of a dangerous weapon can be added to the charge. While a football helmet isn’t a weaponper se, it takes the form of a weapon when used to inflict damage on another person’s skull.</blockquote>
      <p>McCann goes on to explain that while every play in the NFL could be viewed as assault on a base level, it doesn't hold legal value. NFL players accept that they're going to be taking hits and it therefore isn't an actual assault. But NFL players do not accept that they are going to have their own helmets ripped off and swung at their heads.</p>
      <p>ButMcCann says even though there could be a case made, it's very unlikely anything happens.</p>
      <p>From McCann:</p>
      <blockquote>There is a glaring absence of examples in American jurisprudence of professional athletes being charged with assault-like crimes for incidents that occur during games. ...U.S. law enforcement and prosecutors tend to be “hands off” when it comes to seemingly criminal acts that transpire in sports.</blockquote>
      <p>Rudolph would have toinitiate a lawsuit in order for Garrett to face any legal action. The Steelers quarterback didn't hint at anything like that after the game, instead calling the actions "cowardly" and "bush league." So while Garrett's actions would likely classify as assault under the law, it's unlikelyRudolph would take things that far.</p>
