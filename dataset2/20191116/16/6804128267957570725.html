      <h1>The truth about reports of a World War 2 bomb being found near West Ham's London Stadium</h1>
      <h2>Reports suggest that an 'unexploded bomb' has been found near West Ham's London Stadium</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T16:51:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 16:51</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Clarke</a></address>
      <p>Fears that an unexploded bomb has been found just yards away from West Ham's London Stadium have been played down.</p>
      <p>Reports on Saturday suggested that a bomb which dates back to World War Two had been unearthed, but that has yet to be confirmed.</p>
      <p>Ongoing work on an apartment development close by was halted due to the discovery on Friday morning.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10357856/ww2-bomb-olympic-stadium-arsenal/?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=sunfootballfacebook161119&amp;utm_source=Facebook#comments">The Sun</a><b> </b>reported that police officers set up a cordon around the site after being called to the scene before midday.</p>
      <p>The area has been declared as safe, with a specialist team set to attend the site on November 25.</p>
      <p>Despite suggestions that it's an unexploded bomb, a spokesman for the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC), who handle Olympic Park, dismissed those reports.</p>
      <p>A spokesman said on Saturday: "Reports that a WW2 bomb has been ‘unearthed’ yards from London Stadium are wrong.</p>
      <p>"The object has not been unearthed and it has not been identified. Police were called as a precaution and after initially putting in a small cordon their experts were satisfied that contractors should continue their work which will safely establish what the object is.</p>
      <p>"The police returned control of the site to the contractor and removed the cordon."</p>

      <p>West Ham face Arsenal on December 9 and the contest would be jeopardy if the safety status changed, though the club's upcoming clash at home to Tottenham on Saturday November 23 is not in trouble.</p>
