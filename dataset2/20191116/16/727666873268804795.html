      <p>AllHipHop followed Dave East around for a day and it was lit!</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop Features) </b>Dave East's latest opus Survival is here via and is already being heralded as one of the Harlem rapper's best works. In his local Harlem, East remains a fixture that continues to meld traditional New York sentiments as well as newer, more commercial vibes too. </p>
      <p>The fans digitally devoured the album as he promoted it and AllHipHop was present and accounted for as the East hit New York City. During the run, he talked to us in between stops at Hot 97, ESPN and the Magic Johnson theater in Harlem. On top of is all, this mini-documentary gets close to East as he re-connects with his close friends like Nessa and most importantly the fans </p>
