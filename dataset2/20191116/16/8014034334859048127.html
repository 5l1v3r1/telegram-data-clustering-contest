      <p>UPPER MARLBORO, Md. — A man charged with fatally stabbing a Popeyes restaurant customer who reportedly had cut to the front of a line for chicken sandwich orders was held without bond after an initial court appearance.</p>
      <p>A judge in Prince George’s County, Maryland, ordered 30-year-old Ricoh McClain jailed without bond Friday.</p>
      <p>The Washington Post reports attorney Thomas Mooney suggested McClain was inappropriately charged with first- and second-degree murder in the Nov. 4 killing of 28-year-old Kevin Tyrell Davis. Mooney said McClain “has very viable” defences, but didn’t elaborate.</p>
      <p>Police Chief Hank Stawinski has said Davis cut to the front of the line for chicken sandwiches – a popular new menu item – when McClain confronted him.</p>
      <p>Popeyes resumed selling the sandwich Nov. 3 after first releasing them in August.</p>
