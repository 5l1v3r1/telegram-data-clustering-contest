      <p>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Malik Monk hit a 3-pointer at the buzzer to give the Charlotte Hornets a 109-106 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Friday night.</p>
      <p>After Derrick Rose drove the lane and awkwardly threw the ball away with a second left, Charlotte got it at midcourt. Following a timeout, the Hornets threw several screens, with Monk flying around one near the top of the key. He caught a pass from Cody Martin and launched the winner.</p>
      <p>Monk finished with 19 points on 8-of-12 shooting to help the Hornets snap a four-game losing streak. Terry Rozier added 19 points and Devonte Graham overcame a slow start to finish with 18 and 10 assists.</p>
      <p>Charlotte rebounded from a difficult home loss to Memphis on Wednesday night when Ja Morant beat them with a driving layup with 0.7 seconds left.</p>
      <p>Langston Galloway had a career-high 32 points on seven 3-pointers for Detroit, and Andre Drummond added 16 points and 20 rebounds. Blake Griffin had 19 points on 6-of-19 shooting after missing the last three games with left hamstring and posterior knee soreness. The Pistons have lost four straight.</p>
      <p>In what has become a disturbing trend for the Hornets, they started slow and dug themselves an 11-2 hole after missing six of their first seven shots. Charlotte (5-7) has trailed by double digits in all 12 games this season.</p>
      <p>But the Hornets would battle back from 14 down in the third quarter to tie the game heading into the final quarter on a buzzer-beater 3 from Cody Zeller. Charlotte then opened the fourth quarter on a 13-5 tear behind Graham’s shooting and Monk’s coast-to-coast layups.</p>
      <p>TIP INS</p>
      <p>Pistons: Bruce Brown and Cody Zeller had to be separated after getting tied up underneath the basket midway through the fourth quarter. They were called for double fouls.</p>
      <p>Hornets: Graham got his second straight start with Dwayne Bacon (sore right knee) still out. ... Coach James Borrego got a technical when he argued an offensive foul against Miles Bridges when he accidentally elbowed Griffin in the head.</p>
