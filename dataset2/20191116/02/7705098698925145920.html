      <h1>Disney Sets Marvel Movie Dates Through 2023</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T02:51:27+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 02:51</time> by <a rel="author">Blair Marnell</a></address>
      <p>When Sony and Disney struck a deal <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/news/467641-breaking-kevin-feige-marvel-will-produce-next-spider-man-movie">to keep Spider-Man in the MCU</a>, they made 2021 the first year that Marvel Studios will have four theatrical releases. Now, it looks like Marvel Studios is sticking with four films in both 2022 and 2023. Via <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/disney-fox-release-schedule-the-last-duel-the-kings-man-nimona-1202787773/">Deadline</a>, Disney has added a date to Marvel’s 2022 slate, and revealed the dates for four Marvel movies in 2023.</p>
      <p>The first new date is October 7, 2022. This is significant because it’s the same weekend that <b>Joker</b> came out earlier this year. Marvel and Disney may believe that slot is primed for box office success in the near future. The previously announced dates for 2022 are untitled films on February 18 and July 29, with <b>Black Panther 2</b> dropping on May 6, 2022.</p>
      <p>Marvel and Disney are kicking off 2023 with an untitled film on February 17. After that, three more untitled Marvel movies will follow on May 5, 2023; July 28, 2023; and November 3, 2023.</p>

      <p>Only Disney and Marvel know for sure which films will fill out those dates. However, we can make a few educated guesses. James Gunn is slated to helm <b>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</b> once he finishes <b>The Suicide Squad</b>. The third <b>Guardians</b> movie may be ideal for the May 2023 slot. Sequels to <b>Captain Marvel</b> and <b>Ant-Man</b> have both been confirmed; which could also be slated in either 2022 or 2023. Additionally, Mahershala Ali’s <b>Blade</b> reboot will likely fall in either 2022 or 2023. Plus, the MCU has to deal with the <b>Fantastic Four</b> and the <b>X-Men</b> at some point. Between four movies a year and numerous Disney+ series, the possibilities are intriguing.</p>
