      <h3>Impeachment Hearing Against Trump</h3>
      <p>Trump's comments on Yovanovitch <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911151077319687-day-two-public-hearings-trump-impeachment/">were read out loud by Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA)</a> during the House impeachment hearing on 15 November, claiming it was part of a "witness intimidation" campaign.</p>
      <p>In a serious of recent tweets, Trump criticised Yovanovitch for her performance during the impeachment hearing against him and defended his decision to replace her at the post back in May.</p>

      <p>The impeachment inquiry against President Trump was launched on 24 September over a whistleblower complaint that the President allegedly put pressure on the Ukranian president Volodymir Zelensky to investigate into potential corruption dealings of Joe Biden and his son in Ukraine. It turned out later, however, that the information provided by the so-called whistleblower was ''something they heard from somebody else''.</p>
      <p>Right from the start, Donald Trump has dismissed the impeachment inquiry against him as another ''witch hunt'' and insists that pure hearsay cannot serve as the basis for impeachment.</p>
