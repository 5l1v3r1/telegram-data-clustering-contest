      <h1>What We Learned from DC's February 2020 Solicitations</h1>

      <h3>New Creative Teams abound</h3>
      <p>As DC previously promised, <a href="https://www.newsarama.com/47882-dc-comics-february-2020-solicitations.html">the publisher’s solicitations for February 2020</a> feature the continuation of the “Leviathan” event and the start of several new titles. But among the comic book descriptions released today are a few new details about what readers can expect in February.</p>
      <p>Newsarama takes a look at what we learned from the latest batch of DC's February solicitations.</p>

      <h3>Poison Power</h3>
      <p>After her death in <i>Heroes in Crisis</i>, Poison Ivy was resurrected as a plant-person with some type of connection to the Green. While her new status has been good for gags in <b>Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy</b>, it hasn’t been clear what it means for the character’s future.</p>
      <p>The solicitation for <b>Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy #6</b>, the final issue of the limited series, seems to promise an answer: “The revelation of Poison Ivy’s shocking secret will rock you to your core!”</p>

      <h3>Doom/Leviathan Crossover</h3>
      <p>Over the last few months, as both <i>Justice League</i> and <i>Action Comics</i> have spawned event comics, the Scott Snyder/Doom half of that equation hasn’t interacted much with the Brian Michael Bendis/Leviathan part.</p>
      <p>That looks like it’s going to change in a big way come February when Bendis’ <b>Action Comics #1020</b> says there’s an end to the “alliance” that apparently existed previously between the Legion of Doom and Leviathan.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://img.purch.com/o/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uZXdzYXJhbWEuY29tL2ltYWdlcy9pLzAwMC8yNjkvMDA2L29yaWdpbmFsL1RFUlJJRklDU19DVl9EQU5fMjUuanBn"/>

      <h3>Reader’s Choice?</h3>
      <p><b>The Terrifics #25</b> will be a “special, extra-sized” issue, and its description sounds pretty unusual. If the solicitation copy is correct, creators Gene Luen Yang and Dan Mora have crafted some sort of “pick your ending” story for the readers. The “multi-path journey” seems to promise more than one story thread, allowing readers to determine which path was taken — and how it ended.</p>
      <p>Is the series itself ending, taking with it "The New Age of DC Heroes"? That remains to be seen.</p>

      <h3>Sad Conclusion</h3>
      <p>Poor Wally West.</p>
      <p>Really, is there anything else we can say after reading the solicitation for the conclusion of Wally’s redemptive arc in <b>Flash Forward #6</b>? The hero will have to choose between his kids and the universe.</p>
      <p>Yes, we knew the book would probably end with this choice. But it’s still heart-breaking to see it confirmed. Does Wally’s family stand a chance?</p>

      <h3>Zod's Back</h3>
      <p>In this week’s <i>Superman #17</i>, Superman visited Zod in his new home, bringing Supergirl along for the ride and apparently seeking continued peace with his fellow Kryptonian and his New Krypton.</p>
      <p>Well, Superman’s peace with Zod sure was short lived. It looks like he might be on the wrong side of things again by February’s <b>Batman/Superman #7</b>, when the World’s Finest duo have to deal with Zod and Ra’s Al Ghul.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <h3>Steve’s Revenge</h3>
      <p>It looks like Steve Trevor’s unresolved cameo appearance in <i>Event Leviathan #1</i>. will finally get some attention in February. <b>Wonder Woman #86</b> will portray Steve as an angry dude who wants revenge for Leviathan’s destruction of A.R.G.U.S.</p>
      <p>Although Steve and Diana ended their relationship a couple issues back, the solicitation for <b>Wonder Woman #86</b> says that Diana will be hunting for her former boyfriend before things get out of hand.</p>

      <h3>Naomi Reunion</h3>
      <p>Now that the <i>Naomi</i> limited series has ended and the heroine has teamed up with the kids in <b>Young Justice</b>, it looks like part of the creative team from Naomi’s solo book has also jumped on board.</p>
      <p>David F. Walker, who co-wrote Naomi with Brian Michael Bendis, is also co-writing Young Justice #13 with Bendis (who previously wrote the title alone after co-writer/artist Patrick Gleason left).</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://img.purch.com/o/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uZXdzYXJhbWEuY29tL2ltYWdlcy9pLzAwMC8yNjkvMDA3L29yaWdpbmFsL3R0MzlfY292ZXJfUkVWSVNFRC5qcGc="/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Co-Writing Assist</h3>
      <p>Along with Walker helping Bendis, there’s another assist coming in February on <b>Teen Titans</b>. The solicitation for issue <b>#39</b> points out that regular series writer Adam Glass will be “joined by new co-writer Robbie Thompson.</p>
      <p>The issue also introduces a new artist to the title, Eduardo Pansica, just in time to draw what the issue’s copy calls the “most dangerous mission yet” for the young team.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://img.purch.com/o/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uZXdzYXJhbWEuY29tL2ltYWdlcy9pLzAwMC8yNjgvOTc2L29yaWdpbmFsL0p1c3RpY2VfTGVhZ3VlX0RhcmtfMjAtY215ay5qcGc="/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Two Returns</h3>
      <p>There are two returns coming in February’s <b>Justice League Dark #20</b>. First up is the return of writer Ram V, who co-wrote this summer’s <b>Justice League Dark Annual #1</b> with then-series writer James Tynion IV. Now, Ram V is writing the scripts alone, although his first arc (which starts with #20) is co-plotted with Tynion.</p>
      <p>The second return is Animal Man, a character who’s only made a few cameo appearances since the onset of "Rebirth," but will apparently take a leading role in this story. The hero, who is featured on the cover, has to unite with other “avatars” to deal with the Floronic Man’s powers.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>Venditti on the League</h3>
      <p>Last month’s solicitations announced that Scott Snyder would be leaving <b>Justice League</b>, but there was no word who would be replacing him on the high-profile team book.</p>
      <p>February’s solicitations has the answer: Robert Venditti of Surrogates fame, who’s also in the midst of a Hawkman run for DC, will take over <b>Justice League</b> with issue #40. On art for the first two issues, Venditti will be joined by Doug Mahnke with Jaime Mendoza and Aaron Lopresti with Matt Ryan.</p>
