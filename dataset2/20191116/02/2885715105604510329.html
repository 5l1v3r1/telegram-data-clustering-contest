      <h1>Everything that has happened in The Crown so far</h1>
      <h2>The third season of The Crown, featuring Olivia Colman as the Queen, will premiere on November 17 on Netflix.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T02:28:58+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 02:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/entertainment-desk/" target="_blank">Entertainment Desk</a></address>
      <p>A few shows can be hard to binge, largely because of their subject matter and pace. Netflix series The Crown is an example in case.</p>
      <p>The Crown is not afraid to stir a few feathers, and throughout its two season-run, the show boldly and ingeniously unravels and revisits royal secrets. A tough thing to do as Queen <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/elizabeth-ii">Elizabeth II</a> is still very much alive and is the monarch supreme of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth (if only in title).</p>
      <p>The third season of The Crown will stream on Netflix from November 17. And if you don’t have time to rewatch the show, fear not, as we have you covered. Here is a quick recap of everything that has happened in the period drama so far.</p>

        <b>The Crown Season 1</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>The royal union of Princess Elizabeth with Duke of Edinburgh aka Prince Philip</b>
      </p>
      <p>A mother who is not mentally stable and a family with a Nazi past. Now imagine a man with such a burden to shoulder marry the heir to the British throne. Except that you don’t have to imagine, because the marriage took place and the couple is still going strong.</p>
      <p>From Philip’s (Matt Smith) insecurity to the unwilling Elizabeth (Claire Foy) taking on the duties of a queen, we see the first couple of episodes of the show deal with the young couple and their issues. The queen attempts to achieve a ‘work-life’ balance but often fails, leaving a silently fuming and frustrated Philip in the wake.</p>
      <p>
        <b>A power-hungry <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/winston-churchill">Winston Churchill</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>He is old and tired but the will to administer and lead his country is as strong as ever in an ageing Churchill. A friend of the late King George VI, Churchill guides the queen and fumbles through his duties as the prime minister. A fantastic John Lithgow aces the role of the controversial PM.</p>

        <b>Political and royal scandals abound</b>
      </p>
      <p>We also get to witness some sibling rivalry between Princess Margaret (Vanessa Kirby) and the Queen (Foy). Margaret gets entangled in a whirlwind affair with the much-married and much older Captain Peter Townsend. However, fate separates them cruelly.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, Churchill’s government is criticised for its inability to deal with a fatalistic health hazard.</p>

        <b>The Crown Season 2</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>The many affairs of Philip and Suez Canal crisis</b>
      </p>
      <p>A strain has emerged in the royal marriage and at the very beginning of the second season, the Queen discovers that her husband is committing adultery. However, she keeps quiet about it initially and looks the other way.</p>
      <p>The government helmed by Anthony Eden, on the other hand, is suffering from a political crisis. The Crown touches briefly on the Suez Canal crisis and the reason why it was caused in the first place.</p>
      <p>
        <b>A new beginning for Princess Margaret</b>
      </p>
      <p>Still heartbroken over her failed relationship with Peter, Margaret chances upon the norm-breaking and good-looking photographer Tony aka Antony Armstrong-Jones. Things fall apart when Elizabeth discovers a few ‘startling’ things about the artiste’s personal life.</p>

        <b>Jackie Kennedy</b>
      </p>
      <p>Former US president <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/john-f-kennedy">John F Kennedy</a> and the former First Lady Jackie Kennedy make an appearance in a later episode, which shows briefly how the world was thoroughly charmed by Mrs Kennedy. The episode closes with JFK’s untimely death.</p>
      <p>The second season of The Crown signs off with a reunion of Philip and Elizabeth and the birth of their fourth child, Edward.</p>
      <p>The Crown Season 3 will feature Olivia Colman as the Queen, Tobias Menzies as Prince Philip, and Helena Bonham Carter as Princess Margaret. The ten-episode series will return to Netflix on November 17.</p>
