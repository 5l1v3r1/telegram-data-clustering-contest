      <h1>TikTok Enters eCommerce With In-App Shopping Links</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T02:00:10+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 02:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pymnts.com/author/pymnts/" target="_blank">PYMNTS</a></address>
      <p>The popular video app TikTok is testing out a new feature that will give certain video creators the option to add links to videos for eCommerce purposes, according to a report by <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktok-wades-into-online-shopping-11573854531">The Wall Street Journal</a>.</p>
      <p>The move would allow the growing app to earn an additional stream of revenue outside of advertising. Right now, the new feature is only available to a few top creators. Although the functionality is not limited to retail, some video creators have been linking to products on Amazon.</p>
      <p>“We’re always experimenting with new ways to improve the app experience,” a <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/mobile-commerce/2019/tiktok-video-platform-launches-in-app-shopping-feature/">TikTok</a> spokeswoman said.</p>
      <p>No specific information has been shared about how TikTok plans to collect fees or how certain users were chosen.</p>
      <p>Many other social media companies have also entered into the eCommerce space as a way to diversify income streams. <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/retail/2019/instagram-shopping-features/">Instagram</a>, for example, now lets users purchase products directly from feeds. Pinterest has a similar feature, and Snap launched shoppable ads about a year ago.</p>
      <p>TikTok has been downloaded over 100 million times in America alone and has more than one billion users around the world. It differentiates itself from other sites by offering 15-second videos. The company rivals YouTube and Facebook in popularity, and the startup that created it, China’s ByteDance, is now valued at approximately $75 billion.</p>
      <p>TikTok’s Chinese counterpart, called Douyin, already has a strong eCommerce functionality. Creators can position product listings directly in videos, and users can interact with the listings and complete a transaction without leaving the app.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/social-commerce/2019/tiktok-video-app-monetize/">Earlier this year</a>, TikTok signed on brands including Pepsi, Myntra, ShopClues and Shaadi.com to help with advertising.</p>
      <p>The app does not charge for filters or video effects, but users can purchase TikTok coins to buy gifts for other streamers.</p>
