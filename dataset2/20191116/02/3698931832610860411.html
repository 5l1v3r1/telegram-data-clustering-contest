      <p>Last week, Google has introduced <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2019/11/06/youtube-premium-malaysia-ad-free-now-available/">YouTube Premium</a> and <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2019/11/06/youtube-music-malaysia-officially-arrived-skg/">YouTube Music</a> in Malaysia. It offers ad-free experience from RM17.90/month for YouTube Premium or RM14.90/month for music only. If you’re a student at a higher education institution, there’s now a YouTube Premium student plan which allows you to save as much as RM8 each month.</p>

      <p>For YouTube Music, the student plan is offered for RM6.90/month. That’s the same price as <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2018/02/13/malaysian-students-can-enjoy-apple-music-at-half-price/">Apple Music</a> and it is about 50% cheaper than the normal rate.</p>
      <p>Do note that an annual student verification is required to enjoy this rate and eligibility will be determined by <a href="https://www.sheerid.com/">SheerID</a>. If you need help with verification, you can reach out to them at customerservice@sheerid.com.</p>
      <p>Apart from ad-free music listening and music videos, the paid account also allows you to download songs for offline listening and the ability to play music in the background, even with the screen off. Without a paid subscription, YouTube Music will not work in the background.</p>
      <h4>YouTube Premium Student Plan – RM10.90/month</h4>

      <p>For the ultimate experience, YouTube Premium covers your favourite YouTube videos and they also provide you access to YouTube original content. For students, the subscription costs RM10.90/month, which is RM7 lower than the normal rate.</p>
      <p>In case you missed it, YouTube Premium also includes YouTube Music. So it will only cost you RM4/month extra to enjoy YouTube videos without any commercials, which is a pretty good deal. The subscription is tied to your YouTube account, so no matter which device you’re on, you can enjoy the same premium benefits as long as you’re using the same login.</p>
      <p>To subscribe, you can visit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/musicpremium/student">YouTube Music for students</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/premium/student">YouTube Premium for students</a> page. If you’re new, you can try it out for free for the first month.</p>
