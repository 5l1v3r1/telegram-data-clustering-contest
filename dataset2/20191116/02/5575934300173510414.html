      <hr/>
      <p>Four US Air Force B-52 bombers from the 2nd Bomb Wing at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana arrived in England with about 300 airmen on October 10 for a bomber task force deployment.</p>
      <p>The bombers were <a href="https://www.afgsc.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/1985950/bomber-task-force-deploys-to-europe/">deployed</a> to RAF Fairford to “conduct integration and interoperability training” with partners in the region and to “exercise Air Force Global Strike Command’s ability to conduct bomber operations from a forward operating location” in support of US Air Forces in Europe and US European Command.</p>
      <p>Amid heightened tensions with Russia after its 2014 seizure of Crimea, bomber task force exercises over Europe are also meant to reassure US partners and to be a deterrent to Moscow – this deployment, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/b2-bombers-land-in-iceland-fly-in-arctic-first-time-2019-9">like others before it</a>, also saw US bombers fly close to Russia in Eastern Europe and the high north.</p>
      <p>Below, you can see what US airmen and bombers did during the month they were in Europe.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Bomber Task Force 20-1 was “part of a routine forward deployment of bomber aircraft in the European theatre that demonstrates the US commitment to the collective defence of the NATO alliance,” a US Air Forces Europe-Africa spokeswoman said.</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>The Barksdale B-52s’ deployment to RAF Fairford was their first since this spring, the spokeswoman said, and comes not long after a B-2 Spirit bomber task force deployment in August and September that saw the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/b2-bombers-land-in-iceland-fly-in-arctic-first-time-2019-9">stealth bomber accomplish several firsts over Europe</a>.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>BTF 20-1 missions kicked off a few days after the bombers landed in England.</h3>

      <h3>The exercises were not only for aircrews. Munitions specialists deployed with the task force also practiced assembling BDU-50s — inert, unguided bombs.</h3>

      <h3>Maintainers from the 2nd Aircraft Maintenance Squadron, part of the 96th Aircraft Maintenance Unit out of Barksdale, also provided routine and unscheduled maintenance for the B-52s to make sure they were ready at a moment’s notice.</h3>

      <h3>“Back home, people are focused on their job and will occasionally help out here and there,” said Tech. Sgt. Joshua Crowe, a B-52 expediter with the 2nd AMXS.</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>“Here, what seems to work is that everyone is all hands on deck. You may have an electronic countermeasures airman change an engine or an electrical environmental airman helping crew chiefs change brakes,” Crowe added.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>When the bomber is scheduled to land somewhere that doesn’t have maintenance support for B-52s, a maintainer will go along as a “flying crew chief” to make sure the aircraft arrives safely and is ready to fly once it lands.</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>For a crew chief to qualify for that job, they must be at the top of their career field and complete hanging-harness training, a flight-equipment course, and go through the altitude chamber.</p>
      <p>“We are essentially passengers on the aircraft, though we help the aircrew troubleshoot some things,” <a href="https://www.dvidshub.net/news/351244/high-flying-maintenance">said</a> Tech. Sgt. Gregory Oliver, a communications navigations technician. “However, when we land, we hit the ground running. We service the jet and get it ready to fly again.”</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>On October 21, the B-52s ventured east to the Black Sea, flying a 12-hour, extended-duration sortie to train with counterparts from Romania, Ukraine and Georgia.</h3>
