      <p>The board of trustees and advisory board of Gender Frontier Development Initiatives, GFDI, a non-governmental organisation (NGO), has lamented the effects of Female Genital Mutilation on the victims.</p>
      <p>The group made  the remark during its inaugural meeting held at Adunola Chambers, Ijapo,  Akure, Ondo State on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The GFDI head, Mr. Michael Olushola Ogunsakin, in his keynote address said the NGO was borne out of passion, focusing on women and African child emancipation with zero tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), child labour, abuse and molestation, human trafficking as well as violence against women in line with the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p>

      <p>He called for the eradication of FGM saying the practice  exposes the victims to severe pains, excessive bleeding, genital tissue swelling infections and psychological consequences.</p>
      <p>A member of the advisory board and a lecturer at the Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba, Dr.  Ayeni, said a coalition will be formed to compel the system to do the needful from the local to federal government, that GFDI will embark on various plans and programmes with relevant agencies of government, civil organisations and development partners to confront these injustices against humanity, for the attainment of sustainable socio economic development and crime free society.</p>
      <p>Present at the meeting include   Mr. Ephraim Audu and Mr Alaba Adeyemi both  members of board of trustees.</p>
