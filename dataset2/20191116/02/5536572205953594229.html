      <p>Vontaze Burfict must want his career to be over, because calling out a commissioner is not a good way to get back into his good graces.</p>
      <p>The Oakland Raiders linebacker was speaking to The Athletic’s Vic Tafur and he did not mince words when he referred to Roger Goodell as a “total b—h” when the two met in New York and the commissioner upheld his 12-game suspension for a helmet-to-helmet hit on Indianapolis Colts tight end Jack Doyle.</p>

      <p>“He was a b—h,” Burfict said. “He didn’t let anybody speak; he rushed us in and out of the meeting. The meeting was bulls–t. He already had the suspension in his hand.”</p>
      <p>Burfict said he showed a video of his clean plays and dirty plays made against him that weren’t flagged that he didn’t even retaliate for.</p>
      <p>“They didn’t give a f–k about that s–t,” he said.</p>
