      <h1>Thousands of Hacked Disney+ Accounts Are Already For Sale On Hacking Forums</h1>

      <p>An anonymous reader quotes ZDNet: <i>Hackers didn't waste any time and <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/thousands-of-hacked-disney-accounts-are-already-for-sale-on-hacking-forums/">have started hijacking Disney+ user accounts hours after the service launched</a>. Many of these accounts are now being offered for free on hacking forums, or available for sale for prices varying from $3 to $11, a ZDNet investigation has discovered... Many users reported that hackers were accessing their accounts, logging them out of all devices, and then changing the account's email and password, effectively taking over the account and locking the previous owner out...<br/><br/>Two users who spoke with ZDNet on the condition we do not share their names admitted that they reused passwords. However, other users said online that they did not, and had used passwords unique for their Disney+ accounts. This suggests that in some cases hackers gained access to accounts by using email and password combos leaked at other sites, while in other cases the Disney+ credentials might have been obtained from users infected with keylogging or info-stealing malware.<br/><br/>The speed at which hackers have mobilized to monetize Disney+ accounts is astounding.</i></p>
