      <h2>The Saskatchewan Roughriders are poised to play host to the rarest of home games — a West Division final.</h2>

      <p>An expanded Taylor Field had a second deck, but a second West final never materialized.</p>
      <p>Over a span of 38 football seasons, commencing in 1979, the Saskatchewan Roughriders played host to only one division championship game.</p>
      <p>And that was 30 years after an upper level was added to Piffles’ pitch.</p>
      <p>This is just one way of underlining how uncommon it is for the Roughriders to stage a game such as the one in which they will compete on Sunday, when the Winnipeg Blue Bombers visit new Mosaic Stadium with a Grey Cup berth at stake.</p>
      <p>Regardless of <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/rob-vanstone-saskatchewan-roughriders-need-a-return-to-the-days-of-legenddarian-playoff-quarterbacking">how the first-place Roughriders</a> fare on Sunday, the mere fact that they are a host team on the penultimate weekend of the CFL season is something that their fervent fans should cherish.</p>
      <p>A Regina-based West final is about to be played for only the second time in the life span of <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/what-the-heck-did-they-do-to-our-gopher-rider-fans-react-to-gainers-new-look">Gainer the Gopher</a> (b. 1977).</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Over that time, the Queen City has played host to a greater number of Grey Cup games (three) and celebrated just as many CFL championships.</p>
      <p>The Green and White has also played in nine of the past 42 West finals. But only one of those games, held in 2009, was on home turf.</p>
      <p>Consider, too, that Sunday’s game is only the fifth in the history of the Saskatchewan (as opposed to Regina) Roughriders in which the home team can punch its ticket to the Grey Cup with a victory at Park de Young, <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/year-by-year-yard-by-yard-a-history-of-mosaic-stadium">Taylor Field</a>, or either version of Mosaic Stadium. To recap …</p>
      <p><b>Nov. 12, 1951:</b> In the third and deciding game of the Western Interprovincial Football Union final, the Roughriders outlasted the Edmonton Eskimos 19-18 before a then-Taylor Field record crowd of 12,463 (including 10-year-old Dale West, who 15 years later had an interception in <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/the-roughriders-first-grey-cup-win-robs-green-time-machine">the Roughriders’ first Grey Cup victory</a>). In the 1951 final, the Ottawa Rough Riders downed Saskatchewan 21-14.</p>
      <p><b>Nov. 22, 1970:</b> Game 3 of the Western Conference final ended at a frozen Field when Larry Robinson kicked a 32-yard field goal into a seemingly prohibitive wind to give the Calgary Stampeders a 15-14 victory. So ended a season in which Saskatchewan went 14-2 — still the best record in franchise history.</p>

      <p><b>Nov. 20, 1976:</b> After losing to the host Eskimos in the 1973, 1974 and 1975 Western finals, Saskatchewan downed Edmonton 23-13 at home in 1976. Steve Molnar amassed 144 yards along the ground. Molly McGee added 100. Bob Richardson made a one-handed touchdown catch. Ottawa downed Saskatchewan 23-20 in the <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/what-you-may-not-know-about-tony-gabriel-robs-green-time-machine">1976 Grey Cup game.</a></p>
      <p><b>Nov. 22, 2009:</b> Led by <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/durant-and-dressler-a-tale-of-two-rider-legends-robs-green-time-machine">Darian Durant</a>‘s three touchdown passes, the Roughriders beat Calgary 27-17 in the West final. One week later, the Montreal Alouettes posted a 28-27 Grey Cup victory over Saskatchewan.</p>

      <p><b>Nov. 17, 2019:</b> Winnipeg at Saskatchewan, 3:30 p.m.</p>
      <p>The numbers, with which you are again being inundated, get even wilder when you consider the frequency with which the Roughriders have had the opportunity to secure a Grey Cup berth with one win.</p>
      <p>Dating back to 1948, there have been 24 games of that description — but only four have been played at home.</p>
      <p>Beginning in 1951, nine of the Roughriders’ 12 West-championship-clinching victories have been achieved on the road.</p>
      <p>In other words, Sunday’s game is a novelty — the most elusive of home dates for the Roughriders.</p>
      <p>That, alone, makes for a compelling spectacle. Then you factor in the myriad storylines.</p>
      <p><a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-wish-the-best-for-zach-collaros-except-on-sunday">Zach Collaros</a>, who is to start at quarterback for Winnipeg, was No. 1 on the Roughriders’ depth chart to begin the 2019 season.</p>
      <p>Next in line was <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/roughriders-head-coach-craig-dickenson-confirms-that-cody-fajardo-will-play-sundays-west-division-final">Cody Fajardo</a>, who took over for a concussed Collaros early in the regular-season opener and quickly, unexpectedly blossomed into a star — the West’s most outstanding player.</p>
      <p>But how much, or how well, will Fajardo play on Sunday? He has been hampered by the most-discussed oblique injury in Saskatchewan football history.</p>
      <p>On Friday, <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/rob-vanstone-saskatchewan-roughriders-head-coach-craig-dickenson-scores-points-with-his-honesty">Roughriders head coach Craig Dickenson</a> would only confirm that Fajardo will play in the West final. However, Dickenson also allowed for the possibility of Isaac Harker and Bryan Bennett seeing time behind centre. The intrigue builds.</p>
      <p>Dickenson, by himself, is a story — a rookie head coach who has helped Saskatchewan reach 13 victories for the first time since 1970.</p>
      <p>And then, of course, there is the looming renewal of the always-intense Roughriders-Bombers rivalry.</p>
      <p>What more could anyone want from a football game?</p>
      <p>This Sunday will be a treat.</p>
