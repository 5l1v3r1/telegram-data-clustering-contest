      <h2>Both told each other to shut up during Argentina's win over Brazil</h2>

      <p>Leo Messi and Tite, the Brazil coach, had a face-off during Argentina’s 1-0 win on Friday in Saudi Arabia. Messi told Tite to hush himself after the coach demanded the Argentine playmaker was issued a yellow card.</p>
      <p>Tite asked referee Matthew Conger, from New Zealand, to show Messi a yellow card after a foul on Casemiro the referee awarded.</p>
      <p>Tite explained the incident in a press conference afterwards.</p>
      <p>“I was complaining because it was a yellow card foul and then I saw him telling me to shut up, so I told him to shut up, and that’s it,&amp;rdquor; said Tite.</p>
      <p>“These things stay on the pitch. But that foul was a yellow and I was right to complain.&amp;rdquor;</p>
      <p>Tite also thinks Messi’s penalty shouldn’t have been.</p>
      <p>“For me it was not a foul by Alex Sandro on Messi, it wasn’t a penalty,&amp;rdquor; added Tite.</p>
      <p>“Games like this, Brazil v Argentina, need referees with experience. An English referee would not have blown for a penalty.&amp;rdquor;</p>
