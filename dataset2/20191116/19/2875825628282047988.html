      <p>Strictly Come Dancing suffered an awkward blunder just minutes into the show this evening as Motsi Mabuse was missing from the judges' intro.</p>
      <p>Fans were left very baffled as the new judge, 38, failed to dance on stage along with her co-stars.</p>
      <p>As Claudia Winkleman and Tess Daly announced the judges, Bruno Tonioli, Craig Revel Horwood and Shirley Ballas waltzed on.</p>
      <p>Wearing a pink fluffy hat, Craig seemed at home in the ballroom as he spun, with Bruno tickling him with a duster.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Shirley walked on with a large beach ball, which she threw up in the air.</p>

      <p>Later, Motsi walked on as the judges laughed about, realising she had missed her cue.</p>
      <p>One fan tweeted: "I thought they lost Motsi on the way #Strictly."</p>
      <p>While another commented: "one of them is missing."</p>
      <p>A third remarked: "What the hell was she doing I’m dying."</p>

      <p>Tonight, the remaining seven couples took to the floor to perform at the famous Blackpool Tower Ballroom.</p>
      <p>This year's celebs packed up their fake tan, glitter and dancing shoes to head to the home of ballroom.</p>
      <p>The grand final is now in sight, so the celebs will know what's at stake as they do their best to impress all of the judges.</p>

      <p>His partner Katya Jones told him after they were voted out: "Honestly I’m so proud of him and I think after even this dance which I think was your best dance you can leave with your head held up honestly; and in my eyes you’re the winner. The only thing he has lost is weight.</p>
      <p>"He came in every single day giving his heart, soul, everything, 200% no matter what after every single dance off and thank you so much. I’m so sorry I couldn’t take to Blackpool."</p>
