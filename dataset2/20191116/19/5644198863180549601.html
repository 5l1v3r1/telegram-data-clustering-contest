      <p>REUTERS: England midfielder Jordan Henderson and defender Joe Gomez will miss Sunday's Euro 2020 qualifier at Kosovo due to illness and injury, the Football Association (FA) said on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Henderson, who is yet to completely recover from a viral infection, had missed Thursday's 7-0 victory over Montenegro at Wembley as Gareth Southgate's side booked their place in the finals of the competition as Group A winners.</p>

      <p>His Liverpool team mate Gomez was booed by some fans when he entered as a substitute in that match, following a bust-up with Raheem Sterling on Monday, and misses the trip to Kosovo after sustaining a knee injury in training on Friday.</p>
      <p>"Henderson arrived in camp with a viral infection that has not fully cleared... Gomez sustained a knock in training and has not recovered sufficiently enough to travel," the FA said in a statement http://www.thefa.com/news/2019/nov/16/jordan-henderson-and-joe-gomez-to-miss-kosovo-game-161119.</p>
      <p>"The pair now return to their club meaning the Three Lions will head to Pristina on Saturday with a 23-man squad."</p>
      <p>England have 18 points from seven games, while Kosovo are third in the group below Czech Republic with 11 points.</p>
