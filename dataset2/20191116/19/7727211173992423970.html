      <p>Viewers of ITV's The Chase Celebrity Special were left stunned by how 'amazing' World Cup winner Geoff Hurst looks for his age.</p>
      <p>The 77-year-old who remains the only man to score a hat-trick in a World Cup final when England beat West Germany in 1966, appeared on <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/the-chase">The Chase</a> tonight Saturday, September 16.</p>
      <p>Dressed in a purple shirt, Geoff won a total of £8,000 during his cash builder this evening, with viewers praising him for having "brains as well as being handsome."</p>
      <p>Geoff was on the celebrity version of the show raising money for his chosen charity, alongside Corrie Star Hayley Tamaddon, stand up comedian Rob Beckett and TV presenter Gaby Roslin.</p>
