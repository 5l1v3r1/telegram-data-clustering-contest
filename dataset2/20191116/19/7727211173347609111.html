      <p>Mystery surrounds the lonely death of a 59-year-old man whose body was found in a <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/toxteth">Toxteth </a>flat last week.</p>
      <p>Paramedics and officers from <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/merseyside-police">Merseyside Police</a> attended Kaber Court in Horsfield Street, by Brunswick Train Station, on Thursday November 7 after staff from a lettings agency found the man's body during a welfare check.</p>
      <p>Police say the man has since been identified and his next of kin informed, but his name has yet to be officially confirmed.</p>
      <p>One source with knowledge of the situation said the man had been undiscovered for some time, although another source suggested there was no signs of serious decomposition.</p>
      <p>Residents in the flats, which are mostly occupied by young professionals, did not recall having spoken to the man when approached by the ECHO, but some recalled him heading to work in his high-vis orange gear.</p>

      <p>One woman said: "I remember the police were here and then there was the van from the morgue. We got told a long term resident had died suddenly.</p>
      <p>"I didn't know him, but it has made us all very sad."</p>
      <p>One local, who had exchanged passing conversations with him, said: "He had been here for around 10 years. The thing that stood out was that he seemed very hardworking.</p>
      <p>"He worked on the railways and he worked really long hours. You would see him in his orange high vis jacket. In the entire time he was here I never saw him with any visitors and he lived alone."</p>
      <p>However the witness said the dead man had not worked for several weeks before his death after picking up an injury.</p>

      <p>He said: "I saw him coming out of the lift and he was holding his ribs. I don't know whether he had picked the injury up at work or not, but you could tell he was struggling.</p>
      <p>"He was always pretty friendly and inoffensive, and we never had any problems with him. He was a typical Liverpool lad, but it seemed to me he lived to work at that point but he couldn't work after he got that injury."</p>
      <p>It is not clear what prompted the welfare check, but one source said  it could have been prompted by bills not being paid.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Merseyside Police said: "We can confirm officers attended a flat in Toxteth on Thursday (7 November) following reports of a sudden death.<br/><br/>"Police and the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/north-west-ambulance-service">North West Ambulance Service</a> were called to the premises, on Horsfall Street, at around 3.40pm where a man was found to be unresponsive.<br/><br/>"The 59-year-old was sadly pronounced dead by paramedics at the scene.<br/><br/>"At this time officers are treating the death as unexplained and enquiries are ongoing to establish the circumstances of his death.<br/><br/>"He has been formally identified, next of kin have been informed and a file has been passed to the coroner."</p>
