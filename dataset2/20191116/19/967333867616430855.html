        <b>They say kids these days are only interested in mobile phones and other devices and cannot entertain themselves. Well, these kids in Vietnam definitely know how to have fun in a very ingenious (and a little bit scary) way.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Five kids from Vietnam have been filmed playing a jump rope. This sounds pretty normal, doesn't it? Well, it would be if it wasn't for the fact that the jump rope is a huge snake!</p>
      <p>At least the poor serpent has already passed away, but it doesn't make the game the kids are playing any less terrifying.</p>
      <p>Vietnam is home toÂ at least 37 types of venomous snakes.</p>
