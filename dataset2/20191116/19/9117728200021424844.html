        <b>Lewis Hamilton will line up third for Sunday's Brazilian Grand Prix following a ninth consecutive qualifying session without taking pole for the recently crowned six time champion. Hamilton couldn't quite match the pace of Max Verstappen or Sebastian Vettel and will line up on the second row for the race at Interlagos circuit.</b>

      <p>The Brit has not taken a pole position since the German Grand Prix in July, but will not be too fussed by that as he knows he has the pace to take victory during the race.</p>

      <p>After qualifying, Hamilton told Sky Sports:Â <i>"Congrats to Max, obviously a great lap by him we seemed quite competitive in P3 and then we seemed to lose or they gained but nonetheless I'm happy I could divide the Ferraris. We've been down on power but nonetheless I gave it everything I had and my best lap of the session was at the end so... awesome.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>"This is such a tough race to win, the track is very challenging and of course there's so much history here. For me I'm often putting Senna's helmet design on my helmet and I remember watching him and I seem to have a lot of support here which is great."</i>
