      <p>This pixel work doesn't bring massive changes to the styling of the somewhere in between a supercar and a GT. For one thing, the wider arches are rather subtle, even though we can't say the same thing about the fat-lipped wheels that fill them. Oh, and let's not forget the meatier exhaust tips, which stand out quite a bit - helmet tip to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CarlifestyleDesign/photos/a.454249704641104/2904772556255461/?type=3&amp;theater">Carlifestyle</a> for the image.</p>
      <p>Of course, we can't talk about the Monza without mentioning the opinion-splitting nature of the Italian exotic. You see, the appearance of the twin-turbo toy has seen many aficionados wondering about a potential connection to the Aston Martin badge.</p>
      <p>Well, this isn't exactly fair and here's why - if we consider all the design limitations of a front-engined speed tool released nowadays, there's really not that much designers could do to create a larger gap between this model and Gaydon machines.</p>
      <p>And if you happen to be among those who feel otherwise, there's a story you should check out. I'm referring to an article we published earlier today, one that sees a designer taking us trhough a styling comparison involving the Ferrari Roma, the Aston Martin Vantage and the Maserati Alfieri - the concept car obviously wasn't chosen by accident, as you'll notice in the said tale.</p>
      <p>PS: If you wish to find out more about the possible future of the Alfieri (after all, Maserati has massive plans for its future), then you should head over to this article - you'll be greeted by another rendering, one that showcases the successor of the retiring Maserati GranTurismo, which is in the pipeline. üèÅ</p>
