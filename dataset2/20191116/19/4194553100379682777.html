      <h1>‘Same against Villa, lad!’: Some Reds fans send a message to Neco Williams as he nets twice for Wales U19s</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T19:27:29+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 19:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/mattaddison/" target="_blank">Matt Addison</a></address>
      <p>Reds youngster Neco Williams, who played at Anfield against Arsenal in the 5-5 draw in the Carabao Cup, netted twice for his country Wales this afternoon in an U19 European Championship qualifier.</p>
      <p>The right-back, who played as a winger earlier in his youth days, was on target against Russia as his team came from behind to draw 2-2.</p>
      <p>It means qualification for the tournament proper will have to wait until the final game of the qualifying campaign when Wales will face Kosovo.</p>
      <p>This is how some Reds fans took to Twitter to react when they saw he’d scored two.</p>
      <blockquote>Do same vs aston villa lad<br/>— __[•]__ (@Ginu_Wijnaldum) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ginu_Wijnaldum/status/1195741778323726337?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 16, 2019</a></blockquote>

      <blockquote>Move Arnold to midfield , Williams stand RB 🤣😋<br/>— Prin_90s (@90sPrin) <a href="https://twitter.com/90sPrin/status/1195752344928997377?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 16, 2019</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>Didn't need to watch him twice to know he's a fine player.. Keep it up boy<br/>— habib young doc (@ADEOTIC) <a href="https://twitter.com/ADEOTIC/status/1195748650338717699?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 16, 2019</a></blockquote>
      <p>The suggestion of moving Trent Alexander-Arnold into midfield and playing Williams at full-back will be particularly interesting to many fans who have wanted the current right-back to move further up the pitch like Steven Gerrard did at a similar age.</p>
      <p>There’s no suggestion that Jurgen Klopp will do that imminently, but it could be something that he tries in the coming seasons if Williams continues to improve at the rate he currently is.</p>
