        <b>Ferrari's Charles Leclerc was left deflated after a disappointing qualifying combined with a ten place grid penalty leaves him starting P14 for Sunday's Brazilian Grand Prix. The Monegasque couldn't string a whole lap together, with a poor middle sector spoiling his chances of qualifying higher.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Leclerc was also hit with a penalty for going over engine allowances for the season, so a good qualifying was imperative.</p>

      <p>After the session he told Sky Sports that he will be going for it tomorrow, so expect some overtakes from car number 16 on raceday!</p>

      <p>
        <i>"I didn’t do the job in the car so sorry to the team, but with the grid penalty it was always going to be tough.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"I’ll be full-on attack mode tomorrow. I enjoy the fight from the back and I’ll try ensure I do a good job for the team."</i>
