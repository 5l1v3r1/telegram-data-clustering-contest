      <p>Nov. 16 (UPI) -- Mark Sandy, a senior Office of Management and Budget official, arrived Saturday on Capitol Hill to testify in the House's impeachment inquiry in defiance of White House orders.</p>
      <p>Speaking during a closed-door meeting, he's the first official from the office to give testimony to lawmakers in the probe.</p>
      <p>The agency itself<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/omb-official-arrives-closed-door-testimony-amid-impeachment/story?id=67066907&amp;cid=social_twitter_abcn"> has rejected repeated subpoenas</a> for documents related to House Democrats' investigation into whether the Trump administration withheld military aid to Ukraine to pressure the country to launch an investigation of Democratic presidential candidate <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Joe_Biden/?tps=1">Joe Biden</a>, and his son, Hunter Biden, for political gain.</p>
      <p>Investigators hope Sandy<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/16/politics/mark-sandy-deposition-impeachment-inquiry/index.html"> has insight on internal conversations</a> he can share surrounding the Trump administration's freezing of nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine over the summer.</p>
      <p>The aid was released on <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Sept._11/?tps=1">Sept. 11</a> after the White House was made aware of a whistle-blower complaint about the July 25 call between President <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Donald_Trump/?tps=1">Donald Trump</a> and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.</p>
      <p>On the July 25 call, Trump asked Zelensky to "do us a favor" and look into Biden and his son, and suggested he also check if Ukraine was involved in 2016 election interference despite special counsel <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Robert_Mueller/?tps=1">Robert Mueller</a> concluding Russia was the country involved.</p>
      <p>House Speaker Nancy <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/Voices/2019/09/25/Transcript-Donald-Trumps-call-with-Ukraines-Volodymyr-Zelensky/1651569423119/">Pelosi announced the formal</a> impeachment inquiry in September after Trump released a rough, declassified transcript of the July 25.</p>
      <p>William Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine who <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2019/11/13/Impeachment-hearing-Diplomat-says-Ukraine-aid-depended-on-Biden-probes/7501573643182/">testified in the impeachment inquiry</a> Wednesday, said the day after the July 25 phone call, he learned the details of a separate phone call between Trump and U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland from a staffer. He said his staffer told him that Sondland told him that Trump cares more about investigating the Bidens than he does about Ukraine foreign policy.</p>
      <p>"I and others sat in astonishment," Taylor said. "Ukrainians were fighting Russians and counted on not only the training and weapons but also the assurance and U.S. support."</p>
      <p>OMB Director <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Mick-Mulvaney/?tps=1">Mick Mulvaney</a>, who is also acting chief of staff, said the aid was withheld to pressure Ukraine to investigate unsubstantiated theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election in a press conference last month, but <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2019/11/09/House-GOP-requests-interviews-with-Hunter-Biden-whistle-blower/7201573304435/?ur3=1">shortly after denied</a> the remarks.</p>
