      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T19:15:13+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 19:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>A few weeks ago, a teenage girl went viral for a video she posted on TikTok.</p>
      <p>Why? Well, she looks a LOT like star Clemson quarterback Trevor Lawrence. She posted a video mimicking Lawrence’s poses from a few different photos and the two showed a unique resemblance.</p>
      <p>The two later spoke over a video chat, but hadn’t met in person.</p>
      <p>Until today.</p>
      <p>Lawrence and his female doppelganger caught up before Clemson’s game against Wake Forest on Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Check it out.</p>

      <p>If you don’t see the resemblance there, here’s a video showing the girl recreating poses from Lawrence’s time on the field.</p>

      <p>Social media can be a fun place after all.</p>
      <p>As for the actual football game to be played this afternoon, Dabo Swinney and company are heavy favorites to keep their undefeated season alive.</p>
      <p>The Tigers are a 34.5-point favorite over the Demon Deacons today. Clemson hasn’t played a close game since Mack Brown and North Carolina nearly upset the Tigers earlier this season.</p>
      <p>Trevor Lawrence and the Tigers will be on the field at 3:30 p.m. ET. The game will be broadcast on  ABC.</p>
