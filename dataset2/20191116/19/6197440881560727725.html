      <h1>Google Assistant Ambient Mode rolling out to more phones [Gallery]</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T19:54:27+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 19:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/technacity/" target="_blank">Abner Li</a></address>
      <p>In September, <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/09/05/google-assistant-ambient-mode/">Google announced</a> Assistant Ambient Mode at IFA 2019. It provides a “visual overview” of your day — like a Smart Display — when your device is charging. Over the past day, there have been reports of the experience rolling out to more phones.</p>
      <p>At the trade show, Google only <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/09/11/google-assistant-ambient-mode-hands-on/">demoed</a> Ambient Mode on two Lenovo tablets. The interface on these large screen devices is akin to the Nest Hub, if not better and more feature-rich. However, the new Assistant capability was also announced for the <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/09/05/nokia-6-2-and-nokia-7-2-launch/">Nokia 6.2 and Nokia 7.2</a>.</p>
      <p>Thanks to various <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nokia/comments/dw9vjp/is_it_just_me_or_did_anyone_else_get_the/">reports</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/dwtpmw/ambient_mode_while_charging_poped_up_on_my/">Reddit</a> and <i><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-assistant-ambient-mode-rolling-out/">XDA</a></i>, we now have a very good look at the phone Assistant Ambient Mode UI. When rolled out, setup begins with a “Do more while your device is charging with Ambient Mode” prompt. Agreeing to “Turn on,” requires Voice Match, allowing personal results, and notifications.</p>

      <p>You have the option to “see a slideshow of your photos with Ambient Mode.” Just like a Smart Display, you can select Google Photos albums and this becomes a quasi lockscreen for Assistant Ambient Mode on phones. The time is noted at the top, while Android notification icons appear at the bottom in a row, just above a button to launch Assistant voice search and charging status/estimate.</p>
      <p>If you don’t want swipeable picture, Ambient Mode will just show a large clock against a black background with the icon row still appearing at the bottom. On tablets you’re able to tap this image slideshow to access the more interactive aspect of Ambient Mode.</p>

      <p>This shows the time in the top-left, while the other corner has the weather condition and temperature. Below is an Assistant-esque greeting, and a feed of alerts. One card compiles all notification icons, while media controls appear separately. At the very bottom, you can control Assistant smart devices through toggles.</p>
      <p>So far, this is rolling out to a range of current Nokia phones, but there are interesting reports of Xiaomi devices also getting Assistant Ambient Mode. The former phones have it integrated (Settings &gt; Display &gt; Advanced &gt; Ambient display &gt; Always on while charging), but it should also be controllable from Google Assistant device settings in the Google app.</p>
