      <h1>Russia 1-4 Belgium: Eden Hazard combine with devastating effect</h1>

        <b> Hazard assisted the opening goal for his younger brother Thorgan and then scored twice as Belgium beat Russia 4-1</b>
      </p>
      <p>Eden Hazard scored twice and teed up his younger brother Thorgan for a goal as Belgium maintained their 100 per cent record in Euro 2020 qualifying with a 4-1 win in Russia.</p>
      <p>Roberto Martinez’s men made light work of a Russia side that went into the game on the back of seven consecutive victories in which they conceded just once.</p>
      <p>Coach Stanislav Cherchesov stood and watched as his defence was run ragged by the Hazard brothers and by Dries Mertens and Kevin De Bruyne, who controlled the game from midfield.</p>
      <p>Romelu Lukaku scored the final goal of a victory that moves Belgium six points clear at the top of Group I with nine wins from nine games, Russia’s consolation strike from Georgi Dzhikiya the only fly in the ointment for Martinez.</p>

      <p>Lukaku’s feet seemed to get stuck in the turf when Eden Hazard’s pull-back found him unmarked in the box early on, but moments later Thorgan Hazard made amends after being played into the box by his older brother.</p>
      <p>The Borussia Dortmund winger jinked inside Mario Fernandes before scoring with a clean strike that flew into the top corner of Guilherme’s net.</p>
      <p>Lukaku’s well-judged knock-down presented the unmarked Eden Hazard with a chance to double Belgium’s lead from the edge of the box and the Real Madrid man made no mistake, beating Guilherme for power with his clinical low drive.</p>
      <p>Russia were pulled apart for the third, which arrived in the 40th minute when Mertens’ weighted pass released De Bruyne, who strode through a huge gap in the hosts’ defence and drew Guilherme before squaring to Eden Hazard for a simple finish.</p>
      <p>Thorgan Hazard played Mertens in for what looked like a certain goal early in the second half but the Napoli man fired tamely at Guilherme before leaving the field clutching his hamstring.</p>
      <p>The loss of Mertens did not stop Belgium from chasing a fourth, which came courtesy of Lukaku’s surge across the edge of the box and a thunderous low finish from the Inter striker.</p>
      <p>Thibaut Courtois could only parry Dmitry Kuzyaev’s shot into the path of Dzhikiya 11 minutes from time, but his side-footed shot into the unguarded net did little to take the sheen off a fine Belgium win.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What does it mean? Deja vu for Cherchesov’s men </b>
      </p>
      <p>Russia are the only side to score against Belgium in qualifying, with Denis Cheryshev’s goal in a 3-1 defeat in March and Dzhikiya’s consolation strike here the sum total conceded by a steely Belgium defence, and this game was not far from a repeat of the March encounter.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Russia caught in the Hazards </b>
      </p>
      <p>The constant endeavour of Thorgan and Eden Hazard down the Belgian left caused Russia problems throughout the first half and their lethal finishing all but settled the match.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Wasteful Dzyuba highlights Cheryshev absence </b>
      </p>
      <p>Russia could have been ahead after five minutes but Artem Dzyuba headed wide from six yards and committed a foul in the process, squandering his side’s chance to take an early lead.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What’s next? </b>
      </p>
      <p>Belgium entertain Cyprus in Brussels on Tuesday, while Russia travel to San Marino to face Group I’s stragglers.</p>
