      <p>Ryan Giggs watched his Wales side coast to their first away victory in over a year to inject a huge boost into their euro 2020 qualification chances.</p>
      <p>A crunch clash that could have been a tense, nervy affair proved the total opposite as Wales cruised into Tuesday’s decisive clash with Hungary with a mature performance in Baku.</p>
      <p>Kieffer Moore gave Wales the perfect start and enhanced his growing international credentials with an early header before Harry Wilson nodded the ball in from close range to ease any remaining nerves.</p>
      <p>Giggs’ gamble to leave Aaron Ramsey on the bench also paid dividends as the Juventus star and Gareth Bale look primed for the game at the Cardiff City Stadium, with the manager saying: “We got Gareth off pretty early and got Aaron some minutes as well. When he came on he showed his quality.</p>
      <p>“It’s a quick turnaround. Gareth was blowing a little bit, which you can expect, but hopefully I’ll have the option to start both on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>“Azerbaijan is not an easy place to come, so it’s up there with one of our best performances of my Wales career so far.”</p>
      <p>The travelling Wales support had been hoping to toast the long-awaited return of Ramsey to the squad after a 12-month absence, but had that pre-match optimism sucked out of them when the team news filtered through.</p>
      <p>Ramsey had recently returned to the Juventus team but Giggs made the bold call to leave his star playmaker on the bench as he looked ahead to a potential decider against Hungary.</p>
      <p>But Wales’s dominant start at a half empty and subdued stadium put what could have been a divisive selection call to the back of everyone’s minds.</p>
      <p>Wilson scuffed an early opportunity after a dangerous Bale cross was half-cleared, but Giggs did not have to wait much longer to see his men make the crucial breakthrough.</p>
      <p>Joe Morrell looked a man determined to justify his place as he drove from midfield and unleashed a stinging drive that had to be tipped away for a corner by Emil Balayev.</p>
      <p>The Azerbaijan goalkeeper was then caught under Wilson’s deep corner, and was powerless to prevent the giant Moore from towering over him to head the ball in from a yard out.</p>

      <p>Moore was cementing his reputation as Wales’s new focal point, but if he wants to continue his ascent from the lower leagues up the football pyramid, his finishing will have to improve. He wasted a gilt-edged chance to double the lead in the 34th minute when his shot was smothered, after being played in by Manchester United flier Daniel James’s through ball.</p>
      <p>James was purring by this point and three minutes later he picked up the ball and drove at the defence before unleashing a curling shot that somehow stayed out after striking both the crossbar and post. But his efforts were not in vain as the ball dropped to Wilson to head into an empty net to make it 2-0 before half-time.</p>
      <p>Ramsey made a welcome return in the red of Wales when he was introduced in place of Bale on the hour mark.</p>
      <p>What looked like a risky selection from Giggs paid full dividends as the Madrid superstar got himself back to full match fitness in time for what looks like a decisive clash with Hungary.</p>
      <p>Many scoffed at the inclusion of Morrell, but the Lincoln midfielder was the heartbeat of a Welsh team who are now putting Giggs’ vision into action.</p>
      <p>Despite his flawless performance, Morrell may well lose his place to Ramsey, who will be all the sharper for his 30 minutes of football.</p>
      <p>Wales saw out the game without further incident to keep their dreams of a 2016 repeat burning bright.</p>
