      <p>Eric Abidal has revealed in an interview with SPORT that Barcelona are making moves to tie down Lionel Messi's future with the club.</p>
      <p>Barça's sporting director says the Spanish champions after convinced the Argentina forward will remain at Camp Nou for many, many years.</p>
      <p>"For us, he's a key player," Abidal told SPORT. "He has an option to leave in his contract, but I know that the president is speaking with his representatives to close the case once and for all."</p>
      <p>Messi renewed in 2017 but has a clause that would allow him to leave from free next summer. However, he's always expressed his happiness to remain at Barça and, if possible, to retire at the club.</p>
      <p>Abidal added: "I hope he stays here for many more years and I believe that he will. It will be Leo's decision. And, as he says, Barça before anything else. He's the best."</p>
      <p>The Argentine star returned to international duty this week following a ban for comments made at the Copa America. He scored the winning goal in a win over Brazil in Saudi Arabia.</p>
      <p>Messi is in great form and recently won FIFA's The Best. He could follow that up with the Ballon d'Or next month.</p>
