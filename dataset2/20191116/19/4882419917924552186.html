      <p>Barcelona sporting director Eric Abidal, in an interview with SPORT which will be released in full on Sunday, has recognised that the squad are obliged to fight for every single trophy on offer and that he has no doubts about their ability to do it.</p>
      <p>"We are Barça and here you have to win everything," he said, with La Liga, the Copa del Rey, the Spanish Super Cup and the Champions League all targets. "We are clear on what the demands are because it's the same year after year."</p>
      <p>Abidal feels the key is the mentality: "I'm not talking about the squad, just the mentality. That's what makes the difference in sport. If the team has the mentality to achieve that objective, they will achieve it. And I am one of those that are convinced that they have it. Two hundred percent."</p>
      <p>He feels the club have signed players with quality and character -- like Frenkie de Jong and Antoine Griezmann -- in order to improve on last season, when they won one title, in their attempt to win the treble.</p>
