      <p>Nov. 16 (UPI) -- United Auto Workers members ratified a new four-year contract with <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Ford_Motor/?tps=1">Ford Motor</a> Co., the union announced.</p>
      <p>The new deal was approved by 56.3 percent of Ford voting members, the UAW said in a <a href="https://uaw.org/uaw-ford-members-ratify-contract/">news release</a> Friday. Covered are hourly employees in Ford manufacturing plants in Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, Missouri, Illinois and New York.</p>
      <p>In all, there are 55,000 members who work for Ford, more than the two other U.S. automakers, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler.</p>
      <p>Ford will incur $700 million in additional expenses in its fourth quarter under the new agreement, mainly tied to ratification bonuses, the company said in a <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2019/11/15/new-uaw-ford-collective-bargaining-agreement.html">news release</a>.</p>
      <p>"Every Ford employee and temporary employee will be at the top-rate for full-time status at the end of this four-year agreement," acting UAW President Rory Gamble, who is director of the UAW Ford Department said. "This is a life-changing contract for many and provides a template for all future Ford UAW members to a full-time, top-rate status. There will be no more permanent temporary situations and no more permanent tiers."</p>
      <p>In the deal, full-time workers will receive $9,000 ratification bonuses, two 3 percent annual raises, two 4 percent lump sum payments and retain healthcare costs. Ford won't increase pension obligations or payments to retirees but will include a special retirement program that "will improve workforce composition, lowering labor cost," the company said.</p>
      <p>Temporary employees will earn $3,500 bonuses. Ford will have increased use of temporary employees but there will be a guaranteed path to permanent full-time employment for them.</p>
      <p>Ford will create or retain 8,500 U.S. jobs while investing in more than $6 billion in manufacturing operations in the United States. In return, Ford will close an engine plant in Michigan.</p>
      <p>"I want to thank the Ford National Negotiating team and the many UAW staff and members who stood together and crafted a strong contract for both today's members and future members," Gamble said. "Ford's commitment to job security and assembly in the United States is a model for American manufacturers."</p>
      <p>Ford is "pleased" the company could reach an "agreement quickly with the UAW without a costly disruption to production."</p>
      <p>"This deal helps Ford enhance our competitiveness and protect good-paying manufacturing jobs," Gamble added.</p>
      <p>The deal was similar to one reached <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2019/10/25/UAW-GM-strike-ends-after-new-contract-approved/5911572046003/">last month</a> by General Motors after a 40-day strike. GM projects to pay $4 billion in adjusted earnings before interest and taxes this year.</p>
      <p>The union next has to reach a contract with Fiat Chrysler, which <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2019/10/31/Fiat-Chrysler-Peugeot-planning-merger-to-create-4th-largest-automaker/7811572516682/">announced last month</a> it is planning to merge with Peugeot. A merged FCA-Peugeot would be the fourth-largest automaker in the world behind Volkswagen Group, Renault-Nissan and Toyota.</p>
