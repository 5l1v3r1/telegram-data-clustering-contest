      <p>The last remains of the victims of the doomed Boeing 737 MAX 8 plane crash in Ethiopia in March were finally put to rest this week, Reuters reported.</p>
      <p>All 157 people on board <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/04/04/initial-report-says-damaged-sensor-may-have-doomed-ethiopian-airlines-flight/">Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302</a> were killed after the plane nosedived shortly after takeoff. The plane crashed with such force that only partial remains of the victims were recovered.</p>
      <p>Families of some of the victims were upset they weren’t given enough notice to attend Thursday’s burial.</p>
      <p>“It is absurd. It makes me shudder that Boeing and Ethiopian Airlines are at my father’s funeral and I’m not,” Zipporah Kuria, whose father was killed in the crash, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50424679">told the BBC</a>.</p>
      <p>The remains were placed in coffins and buried in the deep crater created by the crash, which happened southeast of the capital, Addis Ababa.</p>
