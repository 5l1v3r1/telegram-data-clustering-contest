      <h1>The Peter Lovenkrands Rangers roasting that inspired Nathan Young-Coombes' Wrexham heroics</h1>
      <h2>Graeme Murty admitted the Dane got his message across loud and clear at the break during the 2-0 Challenge Cup win over the National League side.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T19:23:39+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 19:23</time> by <a rel="author">Graeme Young, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/graeme-young/</a></address>
      <p>Rangers U19 boss <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/graeme-murty">Graeme Murty</a> has revealed a half-time rollicking inspired Nathan Young-Coombes to sink Wrexham and book a place in the Challenge Cup semi-finals.</p>
      <p>The 16-year-old made an impact with the second in the 2-0 win for the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-colts">Colts</a> but it was a direct message from former Ibrox favourite Peter Lovenkrands, now on the coaching staff, that helped inspire the Englishman during the interval.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> stars of tomorrow were too good for the National League side as Jamies Barjonas was also on target.</p>
      <p>And Murty was impressed with Young-Coombes' bravery and ability to heed instructions after the break.</p>
      <p>He told <a href="https://rangers.co.uk/tv/">Rangers TV</a> : "Peter Lovenkrands actually said to him at half-time 'there's a shot that's come off the goalkeeper, where were you?'</p>

      <p>"And Nathan kind of looked a little bit guilty so he made sure he got in (for his goal) as good centre forwards do.</p>
      <p>"A spill, a rebound, challenge the goalkeeper, sometimes you don't get them, sometimes they are called by the referee but we got it and we are thankful for it.</p>
      <p>"It's a good instinct and a good habit to have for a striker to be in the right place at the right time."</p>
      <p>Murty's side are firing on all fronts at present and comes off the back of their stirring win over Slovan Bratislava in the UEFA Youth League last week.</p>
      <p>And the former first-team boss took time out to praise the 5000-plus supporters who were inside Ibrox to watch his side land yet another significant scalp.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He added: "I've got to credit the atmosphere in the arena. It was good for the boys to have that noise.</p>
      <p>"They had big smiles on their faces when they walked out with 'Simply The Best' blaring and the fans are chanting.</p>
      <p>"It's brilliant, it is the next step, I keep reiterating it, we need to prepare these guys to play in front of 50,000, it's not just about being physically excellent or technically elite, it's about having the whole package.</p>
      <p>"And days like this are invaluable, we are really grateful so many people turned up.</p>
      <p>"It was a big test for our young players, it was the biggest crowd that many of them have played in front of."</p>

      <p>Murty's youth movement reaped rewards but the former Scotland international admits a pair of experienced heads proved crucial for his side.</p>
      <p>Senior duo <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/george-edmundsons-rangers-puzzler-mystery-18988671">George Edmundson</a> and Jon Flanagan started for the Colts and the manager was impressed with their ability to get the best out of the stars of tomorrow.</p>
      <p>He said: "The starting line-up was an average age of 19-and-a-half, the squad an average of 18-and-a-half, so it was a big occasion for the guys and I thought they handled it, overall, quite well.</p>
      <p>"I thought we deserved the lead at half time, they made it very difficult for 20 minutes in the second half when we didn't really deal well with what they were doing.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"But we possess players with good quality in the final third and that always gives you hope that you can create something.</p>
      <p>"I thought the two experienced players, George Edmundson and Jon Flanagan, were great with the young players, they way the prepped, the way they handled the situation and the way they spoke to the young players during the entire game was fantastic.</p>
      <p>"They had show different sides to their game, as good as we were technically, we had a good mentality to be resilient when things weren't going our way.</p>
      <p>"I think historically we might not have shown that element of our game. Credit to them for doing it and getting us through."</p>
