      <p>Another week, another round of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/?s=Crypto+Tidbits&amp;lang=en">Crypto Tidbits</a>. The past seven days were rather painful for Bitcoin (BTC), with the leading cryptocurrency tumbling by some 4% according to Coin360. Altcoins have posted similar losses. As of the time of writing this, BTC is trading for $8,500, seemingly poised to break down further as bulls fail to step in.</p>
      <p>Regardless of the price action, though, the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry saw a number of positive developments: reports indicated that Canada’s largest bank is looking to embrace Bitcoin, China’s foremost news outlet, which is state-run, mentioned <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/category/crypto/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> in an article, and Ethereum’s decentralized finance ecosystem has been gaining traction.</p>

        <li><b><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/12/canadian-bank-changes-bitcoin-tune-may-launch-cryptocurrency-exchange/">RBC May Launch Crypto Asset Exchange</a>: </b>Reported by The Logic, a Canadian innovation-centric news outlet, Royal Bank of Canada — the country’s largest bank with $660 billion in assets under management — is exploring the creation of a cryptocurrency trading platform for investments in an array of digital assets, purportedly including Bitcoin and Ethereum. Citing four Canadian and American patents that can be found by the public, the outlet reported that the institution is “exploring the creation of a cryptocurrency trading platform for investments as well as in-store and online purchases.” Serving over 16 million customers, RBC’s platform could be a boon for the crypto industry at large.

The article, whose title roughly translates to “Bitcoin: The First Successful Application of Blockchain Technology,” was seen by many on Twitter as a ground-breaking development. Sure, it did raise awareness of the cryptocurrency, but it wasn’t as bullish as many painted it on Twitter. The article, per some translations online, calls the cryptocurrency “highly concentrated/centralized” phenomena, something that is bad for the climate, and is something “most importantly” used for black market transactions. It also touched on the hyper-volatile nature of the crypto markets.</li>

        <li><b>PayPal Stops Pornhub-related Transactions in Move Bullish for Bitcoin: </b>Pornhub recently announced that it will no longer be supported for payments by PayPal. This move will impact thousands of the performers that post videos on the site to garner income. Many have said that this is bullish for the cryptocurrency space, as things like Bitcoin are decentralized, digital, and censorship-resistant alternatives to PayPal.</li>
        <li><b>Unknown Fund Looks to Distribute $75 Million in BTC to Privacy Firms: </b>Announced in a press release published to an independent website on November 13th, a group of “ordinary” though anonymous people (seeming crypto whales) plan to invest and donate some $75 million worth of Bitcoin to companies and non-profits looking to aid privacy rights. The group’s name is “Unknown Fund.”</li>
        <li><b>Abra Bolster Crypto App by Adding 60 New Digital Assets: </b>Fintech startup Abra is bolstering its U.S. offerings in a move bolstering crypto adoption.
