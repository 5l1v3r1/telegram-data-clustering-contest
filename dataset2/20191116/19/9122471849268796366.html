      <h1>David Pollack Crushes Nick Saban For Keeping Tua Tagovailoa In The Game Up 35-7</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T19:21:38+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 19:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matt-admin" target="_blank">Matt Lombardi</a></address>
      <p>Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa appeared to suffer a significant hip injury in the second quarter of his team’s game against Mississippi State. Many, including ESPN’s David Pollack, are criticizing Crimson Tide head coach Nick Saban for still having Tagovailoa in the game.</p>
      <p>The injury came just a few minutes before halftime and Alabama leading 35-7. Pollack took to Twitter to publicly call out Saban for having Tagovailoa in the game. He doesn’t think the move made any sense.</p>

      <p>Tagovailoa entered the game with an ankle injury and was considered a game-time decision. He was ruled good to go just before kickoff.</p>
      <p>Alabama, after losing to LSU last week, needs to win out to have any shot at qualifying for the College Football Playoff. That includes a win over rival Auburn in two weeks.</p>
      <p>If Tagovailoa is unable to go the rest of the season, Saban will be forced to start Mac Jones under center.</p>
      <p>Hopefully, the injury isn’t as serious as it appears. But Tagovailoa was reportedly <a href="https://thespun.com/sec/alabama-crimson-tide/tua-tagovailoa-hip-injury-mississippi-state-screaming">“screaming in pain”</a> on the ground in the aftermath. We’ll keep you updated.</p>
