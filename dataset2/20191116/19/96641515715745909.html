      <h1>Huawei's foldable Mate X smartphone goes on sale in China</h1>
      <h2>There's still no word on when it might reach other countries.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T19:15:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 19:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.facebook.com/jonathanf" target="_blank">Jon Fingas</a></address>
      <p>There's finally a major foldable smartphone on the market beyond the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-14-samsung-galaxy-fold-redesign-review-durability-screen.html">Galaxy Fold</a>... if you live in China. As <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-23-huawei-mate-x-china-november-15.html">promised</a>, Huawei has <a href="https://www.vmall.com/product/10086831441169.html">started</a> selling <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/02/25/huawei-mate-x-closer-look-june-launch-cameras-screen-crease-bump/">the Mate X</a> through its Vmall online store. It'll cost a steep 16,999 yuan (about $2,400 US), but you'll also have a unique, 5G-capable device that can unfold to offer a sizeable 8-inch display. There's still no mention of rollouts in other countries, though. Huawei said in October that Mate X access was contingent on 5G deployments in other countries and that expansion was "under review."</p>
      <p>The Mate X may face difficult odds outside of its home country. While the US' decision to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/05/15/president-trump-national-emergency-for-telecom-networks/">blacklist Huawei</a> doesn't matter much in China, where phones don't come with key Google apps in the first place, it's another story virtually everywhere else. Access to apps like Gmail is frequently a must-have in regions like Europe and North America, and it could be tough to sell such an expensive device without that access -- especially when the Galaxy Fold doesn't have that problem.</p>
