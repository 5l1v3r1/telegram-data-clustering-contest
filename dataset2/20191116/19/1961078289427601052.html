      <h1>Hong Kong Protests: How Does This End?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T19:30:07+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 19:30</time> by <a rel="author">The Editorial Board</a></address>
      <p>After nearly six months of escalating protests, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/business/hong-kong-protests-recession.html?module=inline">Hong Kong is a mess</a>, its reputation for efficiency in tatters, its economy in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/business/hong-kong-protests-recession.html?module=inline">recession</a>, its roads and rails often blocked. And there is no end in sight.</p>
      <p>That poses a quandary for those who admire and support <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/hong-kong-protests?module=inline">the protest movement</a>, but who recoil at the notion of such a unique and vibrant enclave self-destructing. The difficulty is compounded by the fact that the movement has no leadership, no coordinating committee to advise, to cheer or to warn.</p>
      <p>In the end, however, there is no choice for those who cherish freedom but to support the protests, as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2019/11/05/world/asia/05reuters-hongkong-protests-usa.html?module=inline">a bill pending in the United States Congress</a> does. The protests may be counterproductive, destructive, leaderless and even futile, but for these same reasons they are an altruistic, self-sacrificing and genuine demonstration that people who have known freedom, even in a limited form, refuse to surrender it.</p>
      <p>It is doubtful that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/xi-jinping?module=inline">Xi Jinping</a>, the authoritarian Chinese leader, understands the resistance or the longing. Those who rise to the pinnacle of a secretive, authoritarian, coercive system like China’s are molded to believe that you can control all the people all the time, if you can only find the right combination of sticks, carrots, lies and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/02/technology/china-technology-censorship-borders-expansion.html?module=inline">information filters</a>. To them, any dissent must be a political plot hatched in dark foreign corners.</p>
      <p>What Mr. Xi does instinctively understand is the threat posed by Hong Kong while he is waging a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/19/opinion/sunday/china-nba.html?module=inline">global propaganda offensive</a>, backed by the lure of China’s enormous market. A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/destination/tiananmen-square?module=inline">Tiananmen-style crackdown</a>, he knows, would be disastrous for China’s standing and image. But letting the protesters have their way, he believes, would show weakness and potentially encourage repressed minorities in China, such as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/04/world/asia/xinjiang-china-surveillance-prison.html?module=inline">Uighurs</a>, Kazakhs or Tibetans, to push for their rights.</p>
      <p>Lacking any means for winning the Hong Kongers’ hearts or minds and unable to give in to their demands, leaders in Beijing and their loyalists in Hong Kong, including the administration led by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/16/world/asia/hong-kong-protests-carrie-lam.html?module=inline">Carrie Lam</a>, see no alternative to exerting ever greater police force. And that serves only to further inflame the demonstrators.</p>
      <p>Foreign governments, too, confront a dilemma. On the commercial side, overt support for the protests could lead to a loss of Chinese business. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/15/us/politics/trump-hong-kong.html?module=inline">President Trump</a>, for one, has stayed largely silent on the latest protests, even while grappling with Mr. Xi on trade, evidently seeking not to trammel the chance of a deal. There is also the problem of supporting demonstrations in which protesters have sometimes resorted to violence, even if police violence has been far greater and more systematic. Nothing justifies <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/world/hong-kong-protests.html?module=inline">setting an opponent on fire</a>, as one protester apparently did.</p>
      <p>These incidents of violence must be noted and condemned. But they are inevitable in confrontations with police that have been escalating over many weeks. One thing remains incontestable: In this protracted and painful confrontation, the people of Hong Kong hold the moral high ground in their determination to decide their own fate and to reject the animal farm that China would put them in even before the <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0630.html?module=inline">transition to full Chinese control</a> in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/16/world/asia/hong-kong-housing-mortgages-2047.html?module=inline">2047</a>, the date established in the agreement that ended Britain’s control over its former colony.</p>
      <p>There is no way to predict how long the protests will continue, or what will be their outcome. But the people of Hong Kong deserve support, and Mr. Xi should be left with no doubt that violent intervention will carry an immediate and heavy price.</p>
      <p>The bill before Congress, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/03/world/asia/hong-kong-protesters-call-for-us-help-china-sees-a-conspiracy.html?module=inline">Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act</a>, which accuses the Chinese government of creating more chaos and warns of new sanctions, has the support of both parties, and should be brought to a vote without further delay. Painful as it is to observe, this is a struggle that the free world must support.</p>
