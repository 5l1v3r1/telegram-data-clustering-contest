      <p>Washington, D.C.'s Capital Bikeshare is having to clean up some bikes after a vandal smeared poop under the handlebars for unsuspecting riders to find.</p>
      <p>"Capital Bikeshare takes any incidence of vandalism very seriously," Capital Bikeshare <a href="https://dcist.com/story/19/11/11/a-poop-smearer-is-hitting-the-underside-of-capital-bikeshare-handles/">told</a> the DCist this week. "The affected bikes have been removed from service and thoroughly inspected and cleaned by staff who are trained in hazmat recovery and removal."</p>
      <p>Several D.C. residents have reported poop being smeared on bikes in the U Street Corridor for the past two weeks, taking to social media to complain.</p>

      <p>Local police said they were unaware of any reports being filed from the incidents, according to a representative.</p>
      <p>Incidents of serial poop smearing on bikes have occurred in the D.C. area before. In 2018, a person <a href="https://www.popville.com/2018/11/whats-up-with-the-capbike-dog-poop-vandal/">smeared</a> poop over bikes at the 9th and Upshur Capital Bikeshare station "almost daily." Feces was also smeared on 10 bikes at the 14th and V Street bike dock last year.</p>
