      <p>The deals on Newegg.com get updated often, one of the latest additions to the deal page is the Logitech G600MMO Gaming Mouse which drops the original price of $59.99 down to $27.99. This is a very good gaming mouse as it has 20 MMO-tuned buttons, custom-color backlighting and on the fly DPI switching.</p>
      <h3>The Logitech G600MMO is on sale for 53% off which makes this gaming mouse even more affordable!</h3>
      <p>If you are in the market for a new gaming (or just normal mouse) this might just be the perfect product for you! The Logitech G600MMO comes jam-packed with many features like:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>20 MMO-Tuned buttons This mouse comes with 12 thumb buttons and three primary button The 12-thumb buttons are pre-configured for optimal MMO use meaning the buttons are configured to act as the number pad buttons.</li>
        <li>Dual-Dish thumb panel The dual dish design allows for optimal placement of the 12-buttons. This design was decided by both MMO gamers and leading MMO developers.</li>
        <li>G-Shift button The G-Shift button allows the user to double the number of MMO buttons, as when the G-Shift button is pressed it activates a second function to each MMO key. This button is completely configurable and can be changed as needed even making the G-Shift button change the overall mouse DPI until the G-Shift button is not being pressed.</li>
        <li>Custom-color backlighting The custom color backlighting changes the color for the MMO buttons, this is completely customizable via the Logitech gaming software.</li>
        <li>1-Millisecond report rate The 1000 Hz report rate is up to eight times faster than a standard USB mouse, which means the G600 captures and conveys your actions as fast as you can make them.</li>
        <li>On-The-Fly DPI switching On the fly DPI switching allows for a single button to be able to change the DPI in a moment, able to change the steps between 200 DPI all the way up to 8200 DPI.</li>
        <li>Onboard memory This allows for up to 3 separate profiles to be saved without any need to download the Logitech Gaming Software.</li>
        <li>Braided USB cable The 2m (6.5ft) USB cable cord is a braided cable to keep from getting tangled and getting kinks.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I can wholeheartedly suggest this mouse with a lower cost of just $27.99 presumably until the end of Black Friday, so if you need a new mouse I would suggest giving <a href="http://bit.ly/2OnDgtc">this one a buy!</a></p>
