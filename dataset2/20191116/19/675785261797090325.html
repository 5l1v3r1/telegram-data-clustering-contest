      <p>Clutching a drink in ­Barbados, millionaire’s son Oliver George looks like any other sunseeker.</p>
      <p>But the gun thug, 26, was actually enjoying an amazing pre-jail jaunt to the Caribbean – sanctioned by the courts.</p>
      <p>Despite a conviction for terrorising a barman with a fake firearm, he was allowed to jet off to enjoy 31C sunshine.</p>
      <p>George was granted unconditional bail after telling a court he was going to the Caribbean for alcohol treatment sessions.</p>
      <p>But he found time to trawl a string of bars in between zipping round on a golf buggy.</p>
      <p>At one bar he even boasted of being a “Gypsy gangster” and a “celebrity millionaire”.</p>
      <p>Last night the holiday snaps were branded “extraordinary” by victims’ rights campaigners.</p>
      <p>We tracked George down to the party resort of Holetown, near his family’s £1million villa close to the £1,500-a-night Sandy Lane Hotel celeb haunt.</p>

      <p>Wearing what he boasted were £1,500 glasses with 18ct gold inlays, he downed Baby Guinness shots, a mixture of Baileys and Kahlua, at £9 each.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere on the island he necked Grey Goose vodka and enjoyed expensive meals.</p>
      <p>At the West Bar he spent over £50 in a matter of minutes on shots, telling drinkers: “I’ve been in all the papers for getting a six-month jail sentence. I’m a nasty man.”</p>
      <p>He called himself “Ollie George aka George Best”, referring to the footie idol who drank his way to an early grave.</p>
      <p>He was also spotted partying at the 1627 Bar and Lounge.</p>
      <p>George will be jailed for up to six months when he returns to court in Dorset in three weeks.</p>

      <p>He admitted flashing an imitation pistol when he was refused Prosecco at a yacht club in exclusive Sandbanks by a barman he called a “p***y”.</p>
      <p>George convinced Poole magistrates to allow him to go on a family trip by producing a £1,100 ticket booked 16 days before the offence happened.</p>
      <p>His solicitor Terry Scanlan told the court he would see a doctor three times a week for “alcohol-related issues”, saying: “For all sorts of reasons, there are benefits to this trip.”</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Ryan Seneviratne did not object to the delay.</p>
      <p>George, whose father owns 35,000 sq ft Wimborne Market in Dorset, is now back in Britain and due in court again on December 4. When we approached him at his home, his mother said he would not comment.</p>
      <p>Victims’ rights campaigner Harry Fletcher said: “A different person with no financial resources would not have been allowed to go on holiday.”</p>
