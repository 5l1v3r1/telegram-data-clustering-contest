      <p>The Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC) in Osun State on Saturday said seven persons died in a road accident on Osogbo-Ikirun Road, with only one survivor.</p>
      <p>The Sector Commander, Peter Oke, made this known in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Osogbo, the state capital.</p>
      <p>“The accident involved an articulated Vehicle and a mini-bus with eight passengers which occurred on Osogbo-Ikirun Road in which only one person survived.</p>
      <p>“Five males and two females, who are traveling in a Mistubishi (Space Wagon) lost their lives, while a female survived with injuries.</p>
      <p>“A truck (Mark) with Registration No. FST597XY and a Mistubishi Space Wagon with Registration No. JJJ59CJ collided in the accident.</p>
      <p>“All the corpses and the only survivor have been taken to Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH) Teaching Hospital in Osogbo,” he said.</p>
      <p>The sector commander noted that the accident was as a result of speeding without road consciousness.</p>
      <p>Mr Oke, however, enjoined motorists to steer clear of anything capable of causing road accidents, adding that the command would not spare anyone who went against road traffic regulations.</p>
