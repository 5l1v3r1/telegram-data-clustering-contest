      <p>For he has been generously built a £150,000 new performing arts venue to make his own - and has big plans for how he can get audiences clapping and cheering.</p>
      <p>Mr James had spent a life on stage, at one point working abroad for Thomas Cook, when Stonham Barns owner Alan Forward saw one of his magical Christmas shows.</p>
      <p>Mr Forward was so impressed, he offered Mr James the chance to perform at Stonham Barns - and then said he said he would build a £150,000 theatre which Mr James could run.</p>
      <p>It was something that even seemed beyond the possibilities of a magician.</p>

      <p>"When he first approached me about it, I was like: 'Yeah, whatever,'" said Mr James, who is theatre and entertainment manager for the new venue.</p>
      <p>"I thought this man was talking rubbish."</p>
      <p>But it was no magic trick - and the Pavilion Theatre, complete with its black and gold colour scheme and traditional red curtains, is getting ready for a grand opening in January 2020.</p>
      <p>"It does make you think: 'Am I really good enough for this? Can I prove myself?' Mr James said.</p>

      <p>The theatre, built from scratch on a piece of grass at Stonham Barns, began construction in October last year and was finished in April.</p>
      <p>It had planned a Halloween Spooktacular and a Christmas pantomime this year - but the theatre has been closed since April after Mr James and Alex Morley Productions, which ran the events there, decided to part ways.</p>
      <p>The departure was amicable but Stonham Barns took the opportunity to fully refurbish the theatre ahead of its new opening date of January 11 2020.</p>

      <p>It will boast its own bar and seating area for those looking to have a drink before shows, and despite the black and gold theme Mr James said: "I'm going to have red stage curtains, because I don't think a theatre is a theatre without one."</p>
      <p>A chandelier so grand it did not fit through the front door was ordered, meaning it had to be taken apart and reassembled inside.</p>
      <p>Mr James has already written a show calendar for the whole of 2020 and has promised there will be "something for everyone", from a children's pirate show at Easter, to murder mystery evenings and a talent show in July.</p>
      <p>It will open with a Tommy Cooper tribute show - and Mr James has promised to keep prices low, so families can visit the theatre as part of a day out at Stonham Barns.</p>
      <p>"I'd rather charge £10 for a ticket and have people come to the theatre and then have a meal at the restaurant.</p>
      <p>"There are going to be a lot of people who will be there for the day, and that's where we're going to have a huge opportunity.</p>
      <p>"It saddens me that you've got many theatres which are revamping themselves as cinemas. I don't think you can recreate that atmosphere."</p>
