        <i>With the scores still 0-0 in the 60th minute, Nuneaton Borough called upon an unlikely player to take a penalty in their Southern Premier Central clash with Stratford Town – step forward goalkeeper Tony Breeden. <br/>The bold move did not pay off, with Breeden hitting the penalty high and wide into the stands – and smashing a light in the process. The miss did not prove too costly for Nuneaton, who won 2-0 thanks to a goal from defender Joel Kettle and a late penalty from Callum Powell, who wisely took over spot-kick duties.</i>
