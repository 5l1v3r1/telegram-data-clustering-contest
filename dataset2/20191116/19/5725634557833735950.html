      <h1>Style Box Update - Mid-November 2019</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T19:43:28+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 19:43</time> by <a rel="author">Brian Gilmartin, CFA</a></address>
      <p>Summary</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To preface the content, using iShares ETFs for style-box returns, Value is clearly outperforming Growth across all market-caps.</li>
        <li>However, using the Vanguard style-box ETFs and YTD returns, the Growth style is still outperforming across all market-caps as of 11/15/19.</li>
        <li>One thing is clear, though, probably due to the Financial sector which is leading sector performance for 1- and 3-month time frames, Value outperformance has returned to the large-cap space.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Here is our twice-quarterly style box spreadsheet for readers.</p>
      <p>To preface the content, using iShares ETFs for style-box returns, Value is clearly outperforming Growth across all market-caps.</p>

      <p>LCG = large-cap growth, LCV = large-cap value, etc.</p>
      <p>Finally, let's compare <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPYG">SPYG</a> (SPDR Portfolio S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF) to the <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPYV">SPYV</a> (SPDR Portfolio S&amp;P 500 Value ETF) for the YTD time frame:</p>

      <p>This is the conventional wisdom that most investors have been reading about, i.e., large-cap value has started to outperform large-cap growth as of early October 2019.</p>
      <p><i><b>Summary/conclusion:</b></i> This style-box update is published every six weeks for readers, but to understand the iShares relative performance versus the Vanguard style-box ETFs, more homework is required.</p>
      <p>One thing is clear, though, probably due to the Financial sector which is leading sector performance for 1- and 3-month time frames (per one source, but I can't remember which one), Value outperformance has returned to the large-cap space. Apple (NASDAQ:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL">AAPL</a>) and JPMorgan (NYSE:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JPM">JPM</a>) are the largest two components of the S&amp;P Value ETF (SPYV) while Microsoft (NASDAQ:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT">MSFT</a>) and Amazon (NASDAQ:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN">AMZN</a>) are the largest two names in the S&amp;P Growth ETF (SPYG).</p>
      <p>For client portfolios, Microsoft has been the #1 weight the last 5 years, while Schwab (NYSE:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SCHW">SCHW</a>), Amazon and JPMorgan are numbers 2, 3 and 4, respectively. The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XLF">XLF</a>) is #5.</p>
      <p>Both Growth and Value are balanced to smooth out Growth volatility.</p>
      <p>Selling Apple last year, though, looks like sheer stupidity.</p>
      <p>Earnings updates coming out this weekend.</p>
      <p>Thanks for reading.</p>
