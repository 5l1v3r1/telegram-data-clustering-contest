      <p>There have rarely been as many journalists gathered in front of Zarco as today, and the French rider didn't waste a moment to comment. "<i>I felt alone last month. Now I no longer do</i>." Logically, everyone wants to know what Johann's future will be. Until a few days ago, he seemed destined for the official Honda team, but now Alex Marquez is starting to look more appealing.</p>
      <p>"<i><b>What can I tell you. I don't know anything,</b></i>" Zarco opened his arms. So staying with HRC is not only the first option, but also the only one in the MotoGP.</p>
      <p>Rumors had it in the paddock that there was a place for him in Avintia with a Ducati GP19, but Johann didn't seem at all enthusiastic about the idea.</p>
      <p>"<i><b>I want to stay in the MotoGP, but with a good bike, and a top-level team, and Avintia is not</b></i> ." He cut it short<i><b>. "At this point, I might think about returning to the Moto2 if I can't stay with Honda</b></i>."</p>
      <p>After his divorce from Fellon, Johann doesn't actually have a manager.</p>
      <p><i>"Claude Michy is helping me. He's the promoter for the Le Mans Grand Prix,"</i>  he explained. "<i><b>He knows what I want, but the situation is not in my hands. Honda has to decide</b></i>."</p>
      <p>Even the big boss at Dorna, Ezpeleta, would like him in the premier class.</p>
      <p>"<i>I spoke with Carmelo, even when I had decided to close with KTM, and he respected my decision</i>," said Johann. "<i><b>I know he would like it if I stayed in the MotoGP, but there are so many things to straighten out for it</b> <b>to happen</b>. The only thing I can do is be fast on the track</i>."</p>
      <p>Zarco is trying, even if not everything went the right way today.</p>
      <p>"<i>I'm a bit disappointed with my 13th position in qualifying</i> ," he admitted. "<i> I had a stupid fall in the FP3 and lost confidence and time. <b>The faster you go on the Honda, the better you feel, but it's not easy to reach certain levels in a short</b> <b>time</b>. I improved in qualifying, but not enough to get through the Q2. I've always said that my goal is to be in the top 5, and I can reach it if I do everything right</i>."</p>
      <p>This is why Johann believes he deserves a chance with Honda in 2020.</p>
      <p>"<i><b>I'm focused on the present</b></i>," he continued. "<i><b>B<b>ut </b>l'd like to continue to ride this bike because I believe in myself and in my possibilities</b>. With a good team and a good bike, I can get good results, I'm sure</i>."</p>
