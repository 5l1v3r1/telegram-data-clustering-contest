        <b>Max Verstappen took a superb pole position in qualifying for the Brazilian Grand Prix and says that he is determind to go ahead and finish the job on Sunday after his disappointment at the race last year. Verstappen topped every session during qualifying and was in a league of his own as he took the second pole position of his career.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Last season Verstappen was leading until an incident with Racing Point's Esteban Ocon, who attempted to unlap himself at the Senna esses, but contact ruined Verstappen's race and he could only finish second.</p>
      <p>Following qualifying he told Sky Sports: <i>"The track temperature was changing so we had to adjust to that but straight away from Q1, the car was flying and really enjoyable to drive, so I'm really happy with this pole position.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>"I tried a different line but the track was a bit warmer, so it gave me a bit of oversteer and went wide but the second lap, luckily, was a bit better, so it was all good.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"Of course I’ll try to finish it off tomorrow."</i>
