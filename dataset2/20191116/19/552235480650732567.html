      <h1>Alfredo Morelos on his sweat and tears as Rangers striker gets emotional after first Colombia goal</h1>
      <h2>The Colombian striker was in ebullient mood after grabbing his first international goal.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T19:55:08+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 19:55</time> by <a rel="author">Jonathan McFarlane</a></address>
      <p>Life is rosy for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alfredo-morelos">Alfredo Morelos</a> just now.</p>
      <p>Having curbed the disciplinary woes that drove <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a> up the wall last year, Morelos is firing goals for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> with abandon, hitting 22 in all competitions so far.</p>
      <p>And now he has broken his international duck after a scrambled, last-minute winner against Ecuador this morning.</p>
      <p>Understandably delighted, the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ibrox-stadium">Ibrox</a> striker explained his pride at opening his account for Carlos Queiroz' side after six appearances where he couldn't find the net.</p>
      <p>He said: "It was a real fight of a game, we had to make some sacrifices in the first half but thanks to God we were able to get the result in the last minute.</p>
      <p>"It's a very proud moment for me to wear this beautiful jersey and sweat in it and I am looking to score more goals in it. I'm happy for my family, my wife and for my teammates who help me on the park. Everything is flowing.</p>

      <p>"I think if we (the team) work hard and continue to move in the same direction we will get results.</p>
      <p>"The game was difficult and complicated and there were a lot of strong challenges but thanks to God we came away with the victory. I'm happy.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"We fought a lot for the ball in the first half and in the second we had a lot more possession and when Peru got men behind the ball we were able to make them suffer.  We need to keep working, we are moving forward and we know what lies ahead of us.</p>
      <p>"And we'll see what possibilities come out of the next game."</p>
