      <p>“As long as I feel great, as long as I can still play at a high level and mentally I’m sharp and I’m there, I’m giving everything to the game,” he said before adding, “I have no idea.”</p>
      <p>The three-time <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba">NBA</a> champion said he plans to follow in the footsteps of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/new-england-patriots">New England Patriots</a> quarterback <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/tom-brady">Tom Brady</a> as far as playing beyond their respective league’s average player age.</p>
      <p>"Me and Tom Brady are one and the same. We're gonna play until we can't walk no more,” he said.</p>

      <p>Brady, 42, took to Twitter to add “I’m playing until I can’t dunk anymore,” to which James said: “Well I’m playing until I can’t throw TD passes anymore.”</p>
      <p>Brady commented on the Twitter love, telling <a href="https://weei.radio.com/blogs/ryan-hannable/tom-brady-lebron-and-i-have-been-friends-long-time">WEEI</a> that he and James have been friends “for a long time.”</p>

      <p>“Yeah, I’ve always admired him. He’s a great athlete, player. I think he loves the sport, he loves basketball, he loves the competition. I feel the same way about football."</p>
      <p>Brady’s trainer commented earlier this week that the six-time Superbowl champion, who has previously vowed to play until 45, has recently said that he wants to go until “46 or 47.”</p>
