      <h4>Kelly Dodd is officially off the market and the ‘RHOC’ star is spilling details on which ‘wives will be a part of the big day.</h4>
      <p><a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/tag/kelly-dodd/"><b>Kelly Dodd</b></a>, 44, is headed to the altar for a second time after her boyfriend of only a few months, <b>Rick Leventhal</b>, 59, surprised the reality star with a proposal. The excited bride to be promises to have a few familiar faces by her side when she decides to say I do. “Knowing <b>Ramona [Singer]</b>, she’s- She wants to be a bridesmaid,” Kelly told <b>HollywoodLife </b>EXCLUSIVELY during BravoCon in New York City. “I’m like, girl, you’re going to be a bridesmaid. You’re the one who happened for me.”</p>
      <p>Ramona, who introduced the couple, won’t be the only housewife Kelly plans on tapping to join her for her <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/11/13/rhoc-kelly-dodd-rick-leventhal-engaged-proposal-ring-pic/">big day</a>.  The reality star plans to ask other franchise stars on both coasts to not just be in her bridal party. “Dorinda wants to officiate it,” Kelly added of <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/feature/who-is-leah-mcsweeney-real-housewives-of-new-york-city-3704815/"><i>The Real Housewives Of New York City</i></a> star. “I think it would be great, because I’m Catholic and my fiance’s Jewish, so I’m not going to have a priest and a rabbi, so why not have Dorinda? She can officiate. Probably <b>Braunwyn [Windham-Burke] and Emily [Simpson]</b>. They’ll probably be there.”</p>
      <p>Although Kelly has only been engaged for a few days, she already has a lot on her vision board for what she wants the day to look like. “[The wedding] Probably will be pretty big, because I have a lot of friends,” Kelly said. “He has a lot of friends. Oct. 10, 2020, we’re trying. We’re shooting for that. I want to do Napa. I never knew it was going to happen like this. I wasn’t even looking. I broke up with that stupid doctor and bam. This came in my face. It was a whirlwind.”</p>
