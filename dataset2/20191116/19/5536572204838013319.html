      <h1>Bill Belichick Isn’t Concerning Himself With Colin Kaepernick’s Workout: ‘I’m Focused On The Eagles’</h1>

      <p>I’m not sure why reporters keep trying to get answers out of Bill Belichick after all these years, but they keep trying and he keeps turning them down in the same way.</p>
      <p>While the New England Patriots are among the teams committed to attending Colin Kaepernick’s workout on Saturday, the head coach of the team hasn’t given much thought to Kaepernick or his workout whatsoever.</p>
      <p>“I don’t really have any comment on that,” Belichick said Friday morning. “We’re trying to get ready for the Eagles. That’s really where my focus is.”</p>

      <p>He was then asked which evaluator the Patriots plan on sending to the workout.</p>
      <p>“I’m really focused on the Eagle game,” he said. “We have a personnel department. Those are the kinds of things they do.” Asked whether he’s intrigued to see how Kaepernick looks, Belichick replied: “I’m really focused on trying to beat the Eagles. That intrigues me a lot right there. “Just trying to get our team as well-prepared as possible to go down and play a good football team that’s playing very well, that obviously we didn’t do very well against the last time we played them in a competitive situation,” he continued. “So that’s really what I’m focused the most on. Not last night’s game, last week’s game, something that happened five years ago, something that happened 10 years ago. I don’t think really think that’s that relevant.”</p>

      <p>The NFL announced that at least 11 teams will be in attendance to watch the free agent quarterback to see what he can do.</p>
