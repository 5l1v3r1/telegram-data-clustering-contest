      <p>The 22-year-old took provisional pole after his first run in Q3 and improved on it in the second run, cementing his fate as pole-sitter.</p>
      <p><i>"I think he just got the car really hooked up and the whole package has been working really well. The circuit was difficult to improve there (in the final lap) and he eked out the gains - it was brilliant from him," </i>Horner told <i>Sky Sports F1.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>"It's my birthday let's take the pole and we'll deal with tomorrow tomorrow. We've been a contender for pole in the last three races now so that's really encouraging."</i>
      </p>
      <p>Verstappen, of course, was stripped of his pole position in Mexico three weeks ago, as the Dutchman failed to lift as he zoomed past the wreckage of the crashed <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/valtteri-bottas">Valtteri Bottas</a>.</p>
      <p>Now, with tomorrow's race being the ideal opportunity for Red Bull to get their third win of the season.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"All credit to Honda they've done a wonderful job, and to get their second pole position in the turbo hybrid era is wonderful and this is a high altitude track, so all credit to them."</i>
