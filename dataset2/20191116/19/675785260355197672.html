      <p>Tess Daly stunned Strictly viewers tonight as she showed off her toned legs in a sparkly silver wrap dress.</p>
      <p>The presenter, 50, sparkled in the metallic outfit split at the thigh and wore her hair in loose blonde waves.</p>
      <p>Standing in front of the band tonight in her strappy heels, she smiled and posed for a snap.</p>
      <p>She wrote: "COME ON BLACKPOOL! #strictly #scd #tonight."</p>
      <p>Tonight, the remaining seven couples took to the floor to perform at the famous Blackpool Tower Ballroom.</p>

      <p>His partner Katya Jones told him after they were voted out: "Honestly I’m so proud of him and I think after even this dance which I think was your best dance you can leave with your head held up honestly; and in my eyes you’re the winner. The only thing he has lost is weight.</p>
      <p>"He came in every single day giving his heart, soul, everything, 200% no matter what after every single dance off and thank you so much. I’m so sorry I couldn’t take to Blackpool."</p>
