      <h1>Lombard on verge of history: It's been a long time coming</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T19:42:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 19:42</time> by <a rel="author">Lynn Butler - Sport24</a></address>
      <p>Sun City - <b>Zander Lombard</b> admitted that his success at Sun City had been a long time coming after taking a lead into the final round of the <b>Nedbank Golf Challenge</b>.</p>
      <p>Lombard led the field on Saturday evening as he carded a even par 72 to remain on 11-under par after the third round of "Africa's Major".</p>
      <p>The world No 234 confessed that he is delighted that his hard work has been finally paying off.</p>
      <p>"I don't want to sound cocky but it's been a long time coming. I've made big strides in how I do things on and off the golf course. It's nice to get some results from all the hard work," said Lombard.</p>
      <p>Lombard, who is making his debut this week, says that playing before at the Gary Player Country Club has certainly helped him this week.</p>
      <p>"I'm so comfortable on the course, I know where to and where not to hit it," he said.</p>
      <p>The South African has only one professional win as he won on the Sunshine Tour <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Golf/SunshineTour/lombard-claims-maiden-sunshine-tour-title-20180818">last year at theÂ Vodacom Origins of Golf</a> at Zebula.</p>
      <p>However, Lombard has been consistent, with his best finishes coming in at the Irish Open and Spanish Open earlier this year.</p>
      <p>He believes that it's those big moments that have contributed to him keeping his cool this week.</p>
      <p>"I feel like I've matured enough to handle it and hopefully going forward do one better tomorrow," said Lombard.</p>
