      <h1>Consultation launched over building new Catholic school in West Lothian</h1>
      <h2>Public will have their say on new secondary school at Winchburgh</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T19:03:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 19:03</time> by <a rel="author">Stuart Sommerville, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/stuart-sommerville/</a></address>
      <p>West Lothian Council is set to start a consultation over establishing a new Catholic secondary school at Winchburgh.</p>
      <p>The council’s education executive approved the launch of a statutory public consultation covering the new school’s catchment area, admission arrangements and primary-to-secondary transition arrangements.</p>
      <p>A formal consultation is required to create a new education establishment, with further school provision required to ensure the council has capacity to provide places for additional children from future development.</p>
      <p>
        <b> </b>
      </p>
      <p>Demand for denominational education currently exceeds capacity and is forecast to grow further.</p>
      <p>A preferred site on a B road west of Winchburgh has been identified for the school, which would accommodate up to 660 pupils. Construction is intended to start in 2020, with the first intake of S1 pupils in August 2023.</p>
      <p>The proposals would mean changing the catchment areas for both St Margaret’s and St Kentigern’s academies.</p>
      <p>
        <b> </b>
      </p>
      <p>A number of primary schools would change their association from their current secondary to the new Winchburgh school, including St Joseph’s in Linlithgow, St Nicholas in Broxburn and Holy Family in Winchburgh.</p>
      <p>Executive councillor for education David Dodds said: “The growth of West Lothian due to ongoing development across the area means that more school places will be required in the future.</p>
      <p>“The establishment of a new school is a complex process and we would encourage anyone who has views on any aspect of the proposals to take part in the consultation.”</p>
