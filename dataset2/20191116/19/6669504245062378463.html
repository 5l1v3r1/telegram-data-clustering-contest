      <p>VICTORIA - The Canadian Coast Guard says a barge that ran aground off Vancouver Island last week has been successfully refloated.</p>
      <p>The coast guard says in a statement the barge left the area safely Friday and now is secured at Campbell River, B.C.</p>
      <p>The Nana Provider, owned by Alaska Marine Lines, was carrying rail cars and containers on its deck when it ran aground Nov. 9 at Quadra Island, located about three kilometres east of Campbell River.</p>
      <p>No injuries were reported among the six people on board and there were no signs of marine pollution.</p>
      <p>The coast guard says the barge was being towed by tugboat on its way to Whittier, Alaska when the incident occurred.</p>
      <p>Coast guard officials said earlier the barge would be towed to Middle Point Barge Terminal at Campbell River for repairs if required.</p>
      <p>This report from The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 16, 2019.</p>
