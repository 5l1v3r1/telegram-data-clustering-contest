      <p>PUYALLUP, Wash. (KOMO/CNN) - A 14-year-old girl is custody after leading police on a high-speed chase, troopers say.</p>
      <p>Troopers say she crashed an SUV at the end of that chase on Friday morning.</p>
      <p>It started after troopers tried to pull her over, reaching speeds of up to 100 mph, but troopers eventually stopped the car using spike strips.</p>
      <p>Officers then arrested two 14-year-old girls who they say tried to run away after the crash.</p>
      <p>Troopers say the one driving is suspected of being drunk at the time.</p>
      <p>"I thought it was going to be someone who is, you know older, running because of felonies, stole a car, something like that. I did not think it was going to be someone who was 14, at all,” said Aaron Kelsey, a witness.</p>
      <p>“It’s a scary thing for parents,” said Johanna Batiste with Washington State Patrol. “I’m sure no one wants that phone call at midnight thirty that we’ve just arrested your kid after a high speed chase, and we believe that they were impaired.”</p>
      <p>The girl who drove the car is held on suspicion of DUI and a felony charge of eluding police.</p>
      <p>The other girl, who is now back home, was listed as a missing person.</p>
