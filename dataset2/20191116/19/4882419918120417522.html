      <p>Eric Abidal has spoken exclusively to SPORT in an interview which can be read in full in Sunday's newspaper. Barcelona's sporting director analyses the current squad, assesses the summer signings and explains the club's stance on Ernesto Valverde's role.</p>
      <p>One thing Abidal is very clear on is that the squad put together has the quality to win everything this season.</p>
      <p>"This squad is better than the one we had last season," he told SPORT. "When you add players, you don't only add talent, but also character.</p>
      <p>Abidal feels the players have been boosted by recent arrivals: "If the dressing room is united, there's a lot won (already). All the signing we've made, plus the kids who've come up from the academy, have personality and are going to help us on and off the pitch."</p>
      <p>In the interview, Abidal analyses the current squad in-depth and indicates who could be key in the new sporting project, with Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez as the leaders.</p>
      <p>The sporting director also looks ahead to the January transfer window, when players who are not playing regularly under Ernesto Valverde could leave Camp Nou.</p>
