      <p>We told you earlier how <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4962087/wrexham-rangers-celtic-ibrox-challenge-cup/">Wrexham fans trolled Light Blues supporters with Celtic scarves and banners</a> during the game.</p>
      <p>But according to several posts things took a serious turn near the end of the 90 minutes.</p>
      <p>One Gers fan online said: "A thoroughly enjoyable youth team win against Wrexham senior team till absolute mayhem in my area of Govan stand.</p>
      <p>"What brain surgeon decided to send six officers in to throw one guy out with a minute to go.</p>

      <p>"What then transpired was an absolute disgrace and over the top policing which would not have been out of place in Russia.</p>
      <p>"At least another 15- 20 0fficers waded in Batons drawn and folk being battered indiscriminately in an area with loads of really terrified young kids I had the foresight to duck others were not so lucky.</p>
      <p>"Seen at least two very young taken away bleeding.</p>
      <p>"This is at a youth game ffs.</p>
      <p>"The officer I took my anger out on when leaving at least had the good grace to look embarrassed . Police Scotland a disgrace."</p>
      <p>A Police Scotland spokesperson said: "Police are aware of a disturbance that occurred during the Rangers Colts versus Wrexham match at Ibrox Stadium on Saturday November 16.</p>
      <p>"Enquires are ongoing."</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Rangers said: "We are aware Police Scotland are investigating a number of issues. We will be kept informed."</p>
      <p>Rangers Colts ran out 2-0 winners to secure their spot in the semi-final of the competition.</p>
      <p>Goals from Jamie Barjonas and Nathan Young-Coombes were enough to beat their Welsh counterparts.</p>
