      <h1>Local sandwich shop offers Maurkice Pouncey job as bouncer during suspension</h1>

      <p>If Maurkice Pouncey doesn’t win his appeal against the three-game suspension he got from the NFL, there’s a local business willing to offer him a job until he can come back.</p>
      <p>On Friday, the NFL handed out punishments for the <a href="https://thesportsdaily.com/2019/11/15/myles-garrett-bashes-mason-rudolph-with-helmet-insane-fight-erupts-video/">melee that occurred</a> in the closing seconds of Thursday night’s game between the Steelers and Browns, and Pouncey was among the players to get hit with a suspension and a fine.</p>
      <p>Primanti Bros., a Pittsburgh-based restaurant known for its legendary sandwiches, commended the Steelers center for protecting his quarterback during the brawl, and offered him a job as a bouncer. Pouncey had a hilarious response to the offer.</p>

      <p>That isn’t the only offer Pouncey has gotten to help pay for his fines, either. Steelers fans <a href="https://fansided.com/2019/11/14/steelers-fans-start-gofundme-maurkice-pouncey-following-myles-garrett-incident/">have also started a GoFundMe for Pouncey</a>.</p>
