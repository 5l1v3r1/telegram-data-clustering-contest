        <b>First-half goals from Kieffer Moore and Harry Wilson were enough for Wales, who saw off Azerbaijan 2-0 in their Euro 2020 qualifying clash</b>
      </p>
      <p>Wales eased to a 2-0 win over Group E’s bottom side Azerbaijan in Baku on Saturday to ensure their Euro 2020 qualification bid will go down to the wire.</p>
      <p>Kieffer Moore scored for the second away game running to get Ryan Giggs’ side off the mark inside 10 minutes and Harry Wilson – on target in Wales’ last away win 11 months ago – added a second before half-time.</p>
      <p>Despite creating chances there were no further goals for the visitors, who are already guaranteed the cushion of at least a play-off place, regardless of where they finish in their qualifying group.</p>
      <p>Wales are now unbeaten in five games since back-to-back away losses in June and are within a point of second-place Hungary, who they face in their final qualifier on Tuesday, while Slovakia are a point behind and have a game in hand to play.</p>

      <p>Azerbaijan have just one point from their seven group matches and were behind early on through Moore’s back-post header, the Wales striker leaping highest to meet Wilson’s whipped corner.</p>
      <p>Emil Balayev produced a good save to deny Moore a second goal but there was no keeping out Wilson, who headed home the rebound after Daniel James’ curled shot from distance struck the crossbar and then the post.</p>
      <p>Wales thought they had a third goal five minutes into the second half when Tom Lockyer headed in from close range, only for the referee to rule it out for Ethan Ampadu’s shove on Balayev.</p>
      <p>Wilson was next to be denied by Balayev with an angled drive just before the hour mark, while Moore was wayward with a couple of efforts as Wales were made to settle for just the two goals.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What does it mean? Wales remain on course</b>
      </p>
      <p>This first away win in over a year for Wales lifts them a point above Slovakia, who face Group E leaders Croatia in their game in hand later on Saturday, and a point behind next opponents Hungary.</p>
      <p>Giggs’ men require a victory against Hungary in Cardiff on Tuesday to automatically qualify for Euro 2020, though maximum points for Slovakia from their two remaining matches would render that result immaterial.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Moore making big impact</b>
      </p>
      <p>Wigan Athletic striker Moore only earned his first cap for Wales in September but has played a huge part in their recent revival.</p>
      <p>He scored his maiden international goal in the 1-1 away draw with Slovakia last month and doubled his personal tally with his early header here to settle any lingering Welsh nerves.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Bale on the periphery</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bale has not played for club or country in a month and that showed as he completed just 11 passes before being replaced by Aaron Ramsey – himself not fully fit – with an hour played.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Key Opta Facts</b>
      </p>
      <p>– Wales are unbeaten in eight meetings against Azerbaijan, winning seven games and drawing once; they have faced no other side as many times without ever losing.<br/>– Azerbaijan are winless in 12 European Championship qualifying matches (D4 L8), and have failed to keep in a clean sheet in their last 10 such games.<br/>– Wales have won a European Championship qualifying match away from home for the first time this campaign, having not done so since September 2015 vs Cyprus under Chris Coleman.<br/>– Kieffer Moore has scored two goals in four appearances for Wales this season, one more goal than he has scored in 14 matches in 2019-20 for club side Wigan Athletic.<br/>– Moore had 10 shots against Azerbaijan, five of which were on target; the last Wales player to have as many in a single match was Aaron Ramsey versus Moldova in September 2017 (also 10).</p>
