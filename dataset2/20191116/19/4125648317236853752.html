      <p>Pilots in modified Israeli F-35I “Adir” jets, participating in Blue Flag war games, have tested their skills to conduct operations in areas covered by modern air defence systems, such as Russia’s S-400s, which were delivered to Turkey this year.</p>

      <p>One of Israel’s main rivals in the region, Iran, also wished to buy Russian systems, according to Bloomberg citing anonymous sources.</p>
      <p>The media said that Moscow had declined the offer in a bid to avoid an escalation of tensions in the region. However, conflicting reports from a Russian media outlet, also citing an anonymous source, said that Moscow never received any requests from Tehran to buy S-400s.</p>
