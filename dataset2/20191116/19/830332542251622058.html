      <p>Preceding his death are his parents, Frederick (Mildred Balfanz) Kirner, and sister, Shirley O'brien.</p>
      <p>Surviving Don are his brothers, Jim (Donna) Kirner, Rich (Trish) Kirner, and sister Betty Sakrison...along with an extensive list of in-laws, cousins, nephews and nieces.</p>
      <p>A visitation will be held in his honor on Wednesday November 20th from 4-7 at Hooverson Funeral Home in Sauk City. Funeral Services will be held on Thursday November 21st at 11:30 at St. Aloysius in Sauk City, and then a Celebration of Life will follow at The Dorf Haus in Roxbury.
