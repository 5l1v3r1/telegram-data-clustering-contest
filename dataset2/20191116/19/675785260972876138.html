      <h1>Strictly star Kelvin Fletcher's brutal take down of former co-star Roxanne Pallett</h1>
      <h2>Kelvin Fletcher has won an army of new fans following his stunning Strictly performances but there's no love lost between him and his former Emmerdale co-star</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T19:10:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 19:10</time> by <a rel="author">Jane Lavender, Will Twigger, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/will-twigger/</a></address>
      <p>For years, they shared the screen as a troubled young couple in Emmerdale.</p>
      <p>But it seems there is no love lost between Strictly's Kelvin Fletcher and his former soap co-star Rozanne Pallett.</p>
      <p>Kelvin's character, Andy Sugden, embarked on a passionate affair with Jo Stiles, played by Roxanne.</p>
      <p>It ended his first marriage to Katie and the pair eventually tied the knot while he was serving jail time for starting the fire that killed his adoptive mum, Sarah.</p>
      <p>It was far from plain sailing for the young couple with them at the centre of a hard hitting domestic abuse storyline.</p>

      <p>Andy repeatedly hits Jo and the couple finally separate for good and she leaves the Dales.</p>
      <p>But it seems the years of sharing lines and screen time was not always pleasant.</p>
      <p>When Roxanne became embroiled in a huge <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/celebrity-big-brother">Celebrity </a><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/big-brother">Big Brother</a> row, Kelvin was far from on her side.</p>
      <p>Roxanne, now engaged to Married At First Sight star Jason Carrion, claimed she was "scared" in the CBB house following a playful punch for housemate <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/who-ryan-thomas-celebrity-big-13078203">Ryan Thomas</a>.</p>
      <p>Roxanne claimed Ryan punched her in the ribs "like a boxer" and called him a "woman beater" before asking <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/big-brother">Big Brother</a> to call her to the diary room.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>She asked to speak to a producer about the incident off camera and later asked to sleep in a separate room.</p>
      <p>Big Brother gave Ryan a 'formal warning' after reviewing the footage and claimed that "while almost play fighting you punched Roxanne in the ribs".</p>
      <p>Roxanne was accused of exaggerating what had happened and all but retired from public life following the public uproar that followed.</p>
      <p>And her former on screen husband, Kelvin, had some brutal words for his former co-star.</p>
      <p>Branding her "evil", he firmly sided with Ryan Thomas following the incident.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>In a furious <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> rant, Kelvin said: "Poor Ryan looks broken. What about HIS mental health.</p>
      <p>"She's not 'mentally ill' or in need of 'help'. This denounces that people with actual mental health issues are as vindictiveand menacing as her.</p>
      <p>"They are not. There is a big difference. That was calculated and manipulative beyond beliefe.</p>
      <p>"She. Is. Evil."</p>
      <p>Kelvin seems to have put the row firmly behind him as he continues to dominate the Strictly leaderboard.</p>
      <p>The former Emmerdale star has won himself a legion of new fans and wowed the judges with his performances.</p>

      <p>Kelvin is now one of the favourites to walk away with the Glitterball trophy.</p>
      <p>Kelvin has been pushing himself to the limit in his bid for victory with 5am work-outs and 12 hour training sessions with partner Oti Mabuse.</p>
      <p>The actor has also increased his calories intake to 3,000 a day and makes sure he drinks up to four litres of water a day.</p>
      <p>Kelvin said: "I’m on my feet all day. It’s quite tiring, so I’ve always been quite pro carbs – I think they’re a great thing. I probably eat about 300-350g of carbs a day.</p>
      <p>"About 160g of protein, about 60-80g of fat, which I think is about 2,500-3,000 calories.</p>
      <p>"Carbs get a bad press, but they’re pretty important. I’ve stayed pretty lean, I’m about five kilos lighter than I was a couple of months ago.</p>
      <p>"Which is fine, I think – it helps with the dancing."</p>
      <p>Kelvin is taught his dance moves on Monday and he makes sure he knows the routine by Tuesday lunch time so he and Oti can spend the rest of the week perfecting it.</p>
