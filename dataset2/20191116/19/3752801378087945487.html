      <h1>We are tired, we do not like this South Africa anymore, says asylum seeker</h1>

      <p>Therese Walu's eyes welled up as she recalled the last time she shared dinner with her whole family, 19 years ago, in the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
      <p>The next morning, soldiers raided her village of Mukakira, in the country's north-east - where a civil war that killed millions raged between 1998 and 2003.</p>
      <p>She grabbed her youngest daughters and fled into the surrounding forest, not knowing whether the rest of the family survived.</p>
      <p>With nothing but the clothes on her back, Walu started a perilous 10-year journey that would eventually take her more than 3 000km to South Africa's capital, Pretoria.</p>
      <p>But like millions of displaced Africans, she reached a country boasting one of the world's most progressive refugee policies only to find herself knocking on closed doors.</p>
      <p>"The only thing they ever gave us were [temporary] asylum papers," said Walu who has been battling for refugee status since 2010.</p>
      <p>Fed up, she joined hundreds of asylum seekers on October 8 for a long-running sit-in in front of the offices of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees' (UNHCR) offices in Pretoria.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, the protesters forced their way onto the UNHCR's premises after being served a court order evicting them from the street in front of the offices.</p>
      <p>A similar protest was broken up in Cape Town after demonstrators were forcefully evicted from the building last month. </p>
      <p>
        <b>High hopes</b>
      </p>
      <p>"We are tired, we don't like this South Africa anymore," said Walu, 41, who wants the UNHCR to help relocate her family.</p>
      <p>She told AFP the sit-in - sparked by a wave of xenophobic violence in September - was "the only chance" to protest against her situation.</p>
      <p>South Africa is one of the few countries in the world that allows asylum seekers to work, have access to health care and study while their applications are being processed.</p>
      <p>That reputation helped attract more than a million asylum seekers between 2007 and 2015, one of the world's highest, according to the government.</p>
      <p>With high hopes to begin with, most have faced a lengthy, confusing and increasingly backlogged process.</p>
      <p>"When I first arrived in South Africa I thought 'finally'," said another Congolese asylum seeker Esther Kabinga, 46.</p>
      <p>After losing her husband in a plane crash and being gang-raped by soldiers, Kabinga left her home in the south-eastern Katanga Province in 2011, and walked into neighbouring Zambia with her three small children.</p>
      <p>Kabinga then paid truck drivers to smuggle them into South Africa.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Stuck in limbo</b>
      </p>
      <p>She recalled having to leave home at 03:30 to queue for the processing of her application at the Department of Home Affairs.</p>
      <p>"They give you a number and you wait. At the end of the day they tell you to come back tomorrow, come back next week."</p>
      <p>Like most asylum seekers, both Kabinga and Walu's initial applications were rejected, marking the start of a lengthy appeal process.</p>
      <p>"Currently there is a 99% [initial] rejection rate," human rights lawyer Jessica Lawrence told AFP, adding that thousands were stuck in limbo.</p>
      <p>The UNHCR has also voiced concern about the number of "pending cases".</p>
      <p>Despite the backlog, South Africa has reduced the capacity of some of its refugee application offices.</p>
      <p>Human rights lawyer Sharon Elkambaram lamented the lack of "political will" to process applications.</p>
      <p>"The quality of the decision-making is shocking," she added.</p>
      <p>South Africa processed more than 630 000 applications over the past decade, less than 10% of which were granted refugee status.</p>
      <p>Home Affairs spokesman Siya Qoza told AFP the majority were "not genuine cases" that were "clogging the system" by lodging appeals.</p>
      <p>"Why would we need to increase the capacity when most of the world is stable?" he asked. "You would do that if the entire world was at war."</p>
      <p>
        <b>'Just a loser'</b>
      </p>
      <p>Walu and Kabinga have been living with temporary asylum permits for almost a decade.</p>
      <p>That paper needs to be renewed every three to six months - a process that can take up to three weeks.</p>
      <p>Asylum seekers also said the document branded them as foreigners, making them vulnerable to police bribes and discrimination.</p>
      <p>Walu claimed her daughters were given a different high school diploma from a normal refugee because of their asylum-seeking status, and have since been refused access to university.</p>
      <p>"Schools are instructed not to register foreign nationals or anyone who doesn't have a [South African] bar-coded ID," said Elkambaram.</p>
      <p>"Same with hospitals," she added.</p>
      <p>Last month, Johannesburg's High Court granted a public hospital the right to deny dialysis treatment to an Ethiopian asylum seeker on the basis that she was not a South African citizen.</p>
      <p>Alem Ereselo, 36, feared persecution in Ethiopia after being involved with a once-banned political group as a student.</p>
      <p>She fled to South Africa in 2010 and developed kidney failure in January.</p>
      <p>"I feel shame for South Africa," said Ereselo, almost too frail to speak after spending 14 consecutive days without treatment.</p>
      <p>"After 10 years, being sick shows me that [as an asylum seeker] you are just a loser."</p>
