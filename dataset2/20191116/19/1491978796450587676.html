        <i>Richard Tobin of New Jersey directed group’s members hundreds of miles away to deface synagogues in Michigan and Wisconsin</i>
      </p>
      <p>Federal authorities allege that a member of a far right network orchestrated the vandalism of synagogues in Michigan and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/wisconsin">Wisconsin</a> last September.</p>
      <p>Richard Tobin, 18, of Brooklawn, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/new-jersey">New Jersey</a>, allegedly led other members of the group to paint the synagogues with neo-Nazi slogans and insignia as part of what he called “Operation Kristallnacht”, in reference to the Nazi pogrom in Germany in 1938.</p>
      <p>In a criminal complaint filed in Camden, New Jersey, last Tuesday, and unsealed Wednesday, an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/fbi">FBI</a> agent stated that Tobin, from his home in New Jersey, directed members of the group’s “Great Lakes Cell”, hundreds of miles away, to deface synagogues with fascist and antisemitic propaganda.</p>
      <p>A synagogue in Hancock, Michigan, was <a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/2019/09/vandals-paint-nazi-swastikas-on-northern-michigan-synagogue.html">daubed</a> with swastikas and SS symbols on 21 September. The next day, a synagogue in Racine, Wisconsin was <a href="https://www.jewishchronicle.org/2019/09/22/antisemitic-graffiti-found-at-racine-synagogue/">defaced</a> with an antisemitic slogan and the runic insignia associated with a network known as The Base, which reproduces symbolism “adopted by Nazis after 1923 to memorialize members who died in Hitler’s failed Beer Hall Putsch”, according to the complaint.</p>
      <p>The complaint further alleges that through “online platforms and encrypted online messaging applications and chat rooms”, the group had discussed “the recruitment of prospective members, the creation of a white ethno-state, acts of violence against minorities (including African-Americans and Jewish-Americans) … military training camps, and ways to make improvised explosive devices (‘IED’)”.</p>
      <p>According to the complaint, under questioning Tobin admitted that he had organized the vandalism, his membership of the group, claimed that he had considered “suicide-by-cop” and suicide bombings, and had said that it would be “pretty straightforward” to carry out a bombing like Timothy McVeigh’s in Oklahoma City in 1995.</p>
      <p>He also said that his antipathy to black people he saw in a mall had made him want to “let loose” with a machete. The complaint details Tobin’s alleged online interchanges with alleged co-conspirators in the midwest without naming them.</p>
      <p>In the complaint, the organization is referred to only as “Group 1”, and described as “training to resist ‘our People’s extinction’, or the extinction of the white race”.</p>
      <p>But the insignia and activities described identify it as The Base, a reportedly internationally networked extremist group which is recruiting and training, it says, to ultimately capitalize on, and even accelerate, an outbreak of a civil war.</p>
      <p>For <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/a3mexp/neo-nazis-are-organizing-secretive-paramilitary-training-across-america">at least a year</a>, The Base has been organizing principally online, recruiting members, and developing propaganda.</p>
      <p>The group, founded by a man who goes by the alias “Norman Spear”, has also held paramilitary trainings in advance of what it believes will be a race war. According to reporting in Vice, by last year The Base had already attracted recruits from other far right and Neo-nazi organizations like Atomwaffen (AWD) and the Eco-fascist order.</p>
      <p>The indictment of Tobin comes as activists, and federal and local authorities exert more pressure on The Base and kindred “accelerationist” groups like AWD.</p>
      <p>Tobin’s prosecution is ongoing; he remains in custody in New Jersey awaiting a mental health evaluation, according to court documents.</p>
