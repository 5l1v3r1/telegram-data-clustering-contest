      <p>A man who withdrew large sums of money from a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/potomac-river-rapist-suspect-arrested-south-carolina-decades-later">Maryland</a> bank was the victim of a terrifying home invasion this week by one of the bank’s tellers, deputies said.</p>
      <p>It happened Monday evening at a home in Bel Air, Md., belonging to a 78-year-old man, the Harford County <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/ohio-police-arrest-woman-after-teachers-tip-leads-investigators-to-malnourished-child">Sheriff’s Office</a> reported.</p>
      <p>Nathan Newell, 19, was charged with home invasion, robbery and assault, the sheriff’s office said Wednesday in a news release.</p>

      <p>He worked as a teller at the Freedom Federal Credit Union in Fountain Green, where the 78-year-old man had withdrawn money recently, the <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/harford/aegis/cng-ag-home-invasion-arrest-1115-20191114-r4hqroyxybcypnoev6gf6hak3u-story.html">Baltimore Sun</a> reported.</p>
      <p>“We are shocked and appalled to hear of the events that led to the assault and injury of a longtime member of our credit union. Our thoughts go out to him, and his family, during this difficult time,” the credit union’s CEO Michael MacPherson told the paper.</p>

      <p>The victim’s leg was broken during the home invasion, according to the paper, which also reported that Newell got away without taking any money. His 57-year-old stepdaughter was also assaulted.</p>
      <p>Deputies were told the intruder was wearing a mask that came off during the home invasion, according to the paper.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Court records said the victim told deputies he had gone to the bank over the course of a few days and withdrawn several thousand dollars, the Sun reported.</p>
      <p>He said the home invader looked like one of the tellers there.</p>
      <p>Deputies went to the bank, got a photo of Newell and showed it to the victim and the stepdaughter, who identified him as the suspect, the paper reported.</p>
      <p>At a bail hearing Friday, prosecutor Kristin Timer said “the allegations, in this case, are particularly egregious,” the Sun reported.</p>
      <p>Timer said Newell choked the 78-year-old man for about 20 seconds, according to the paper.</p>
      <p>She also said Newell was never fazed when the stepdaughter pointed a gun at him and pulled the trigger. It turned out the gun wasn’t loaded.</p>

      <p>Newell was denied bail.</p>
      <p>After his arrest Newell told police he was "tired of working two jobs," according to the Sun.</p>
