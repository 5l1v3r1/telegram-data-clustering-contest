      <h1>Alabama Suffers Another Major Injury vs. Mississippi State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T19:05:05+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 19:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Alabama is rolling against Mississippi State this afternoon, but today’s likely victory for the Crimson Tide is probably coming at a big cost. Nick Saban’s program has suffered a couple of major injuries.</p>
      <p>Quarterback Tua Tagovailoa had to be carted off the field with an apparent hip injury at the end of the first half. It <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/why-tua-tagovailoa-still-playing-mississippi-state">didn’t look good</a>.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa isn’t the only standout Alabama player to be carted off the field, unfortunately.</p>
      <p>Alabama star defensive lineman Raekwon Davis had to be carted off the field with an apparent leg injury.</p>

      <p>Davis is a potential first-round NFL Draft pick. This would be a significant loss for the Crimson Tide’s defense.</p>

      <p>Alabama does have some time to get healthy, at least. The Crimson Tide have what is essentially a bye next week, taking on Western Carolina, before playing Auburn in the Iron Bowl.</p>
