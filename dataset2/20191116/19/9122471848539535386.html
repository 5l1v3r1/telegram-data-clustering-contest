      <p>Things are getting chippy in Ann Arbor as Michigan and Michigan State are halfway through their matchup this afternoon.</p>
      <p>When two rivals meet in college football, it’s wise to expect tempers to flare. It’s not just about winning another conference game, the winner gets bragging rights for an entire year.</p>
      <p>Even though Michigan State has struggled over the past four weeks, Mark Dantonio’s team is giving it all they have against Michigan.</p>
      <p>Toward the end of the first half, Michigan defensive lineman Michael Dwumfour and Michigan State tight end Matt Seybert found themselves in a shoving match.</p>
      <p>Nothing major came out of this exchange, but the officiating crew is now on edge for the rest of the game.</p>
      <p>You can watch the two players go at each other here:</p>

      <p>The Spartans are going to need a much better offensive showing in the second half as they trail by 17 points against the Wolverines.</p>
      <p>Michigan forced Brian Lewerke into an awful interception on the opening drive of the third quarter, and then Donovan Peoples-Jones scored on an acrobatic touchdown run.</p>
      <p>If the Spartans don’t snap out of this slump on offense, it’s possible their frustration gets the best of them.</p>
      <p>You can watch the rest of this game on FOX.</p>
