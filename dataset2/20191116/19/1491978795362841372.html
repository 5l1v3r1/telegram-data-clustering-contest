        <i>Some retailers are giving inaccurate advice to shoppers in states where it is illegal to ride e-scooters on public roads or footpaths</i>
      </p>
      <p>Retailers are preparing for a Christmas boom in the sale of electric scooters, even though it is illegal to ride them on public roads or footpaths in several states.</p>
      <p>Federal and state regulation has struggled to keep up with the technology, leaving consumers at risk of inadvertently breaking the law.</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/act/2013/18/full">New South Wales</a>, <a href="https://www.sa.gov.au/topics/driving-and-transport/cycling/motorised-wheeled-recreational-devices">South Australia</a> and <a href="https://www.commerce.wa.gov.au/sites/default/files/atoms/files/minimotorcycles.pdf">Western Australia</a>, it is legal to ride an e-scooter only on private property. In <a href="https://www.transport.tas.gov.au/?a=109502">Tasmania</a>, <a href="https://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/safety-and-road-rules/road-rules/a-to-z-of-road-rules/scooters-and-wheeled-recreational-devices">Victoria</a>, the <a href="https://nt.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/374352/v56-motorised-foot-scooters-and-power-assisted-cycles.pdf">Northern Territory</a> and the <a href="https://www.accesscanberra.act.gov.au/app/answers/detail/a_id/1881/session/L2F2LzEvdGltZS8xNTczMTU1MjM2L2dlbi8xNTczMTU1MjM2L3NpZC9mVVhaOW1aSV85TEJQTlduU1NaVFJadUxCQ3VFNVg2S3ZVNzhLdTlyMXBCZG0ybTRQemM5c3JnaEJwNW5YbHVQd1VjMnZSajFpcGNoUVl1bUlYTHQ5dVI2UjBzOE1IZGQySjJZZDBGM2NMWWt0VTRtWiU3RW5iOGpSQSUyMSUyMQ%3D%3D">ACT</a>, e-scooters below 200-watts may be ridden at speeds up to 10km/h in some public places.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.qld.gov.au/transport/safety/rules/wheeled-devices/personal-mobility-devices">Queensland</a> is the only state or territory where an e-scooter above 200 watts can be ridden on footpaths, bike paths and local streets, and the only state where a rider can travel at speeds above 10km/h.</p>
      <p>The ACT is aiming to legalise e-scooters and run an educational campaign before Christmas.</p>
      <p>“People are selling them, so we need to get on to it,” an ACT government spokeswoman said.</p>
      <p>“E-scooters are the kind of mobile and efficient transport that we are trying to encourage” she said, but “safety is paramount”.</p>
      <p>Paul Sullivan, the head of electric scooters at Scooter Hut, said sales had “grown massively”, jumping to 50% of sales in some stores since they arrived on shelves 12 months ago. He said he was expecting “strong sales” in the lead-up to Christmas.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the share hire company Lime, Mitchell Price, said there were already more than 155,000 privately owned scooters in Australia.</p>
      <p>Major retailers Harvey Norman and JB HiFi also stock the devices, including several high-powered models that can travel at speeds of up to 25km/h and are more powerful than the 200-watt limit defined by <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2017L01175">Australian Vehicle Standards</a>.</p>
      <p>Concerns over the safety of e-scooters have compounded the uncertain legal situation.</p>
      <p>After a boom in take up in many countries, the use of e-scooters has been banned on footpaths in France, Germany, Singapore and Peru. In 2018 a 90-year-old woman died in Spain after she was hit from behind by an e-scooter in a pedestrian area.</p>
      <p>The executive officer of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/victoria">Victoria</a> Walks, Ben Rossiter, said retailers should “put community safety before blind profit” and advise customers of the law to protect pedestrians.</p>
      <p>“Footpaths are the refuge of our most highly vulnerable road users – older people, parents and children, and those with a disability,” he said.</p>
      <p>A study by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/newzealand">New Zealand</a> Medical Association, released on Friday, reported 180 e-scooter-related injuries had been treated at Auckland hospitals over a four-month period, starting in October 2018, with 22% of injuries requiring surgery.</p>
      <p>In Auckland, e-scooters can be ridden on a footpath, bike path or road. The e-scooter speed limit is the same as the road speed limit and riders are not required to wear helmets. The study recommended “greater regulation”.</p>
      <p>Trials allowing the use of private and hired e-scooters within a defined area are now under way in Brisbane and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/adelaide">Adelaide</a>, with another planned to start in Darwin in coming months.</p>

      <p>Price said there had been a “groundswell” of councils wanting to give the trials a go, including City of Sydney, Randwick, Waverley and Northern Beaches councils in Sydney, Port Phillip council in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/melbourne">Melbourne</a>, Western Region and Coastal Alliance councils in Adelaide, and regional centres Geelong and Newcastle.</p>
      <p>Christopher Hilton, of the Singapore-based share hire company Beam, said the company had engaged with “65 to 70 councils across Australia”.</p>
      <p>“But we’re stuck waiting for Macquarie Street and Spring Street [the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/new-south-wales">New South Wales</a> and Victorian governments] to give us regulatory exemptions [for further trials],” said Price.</p>
      <p>The general manager of Bicycle Industries Australia, Peter Bourke, said the legislation was “so fragmented in different states and territories, it actually makes the sale of scooters very problematic”.</p>
      <p>Several stores contacted by Guardian Australia gave inaccurate advice on the laws.</p>
      <p>At a JB HiFi store in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/sydney">Sydney</a>, a sales assistant advised “they let us sell here, so they’re legal to ride”, while a staff member in Melbourne said “they’re legal to ride up to 30km/h on a footpath”.</p>
      <p>Customer service at a Target store in Melbourne said e-scooters were legal to ride anywhere, “but you need to wear a helmet”, while a Harvey Norman Adelaide sales assistant said: “They’re legal. I see them riding around all the time.”</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said that under Australian consumer law, businesses must not provide information about products that are “false or misleading”.</p>
      <p>Both NSW Fair Trading and Consumer Affairs Victoria said it was legal for retailers to sell e-scooters, but selling customers products based on information that is “misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive” carried a maximum penalty of $10m for a corporation.</p>
      <p>A day after being contacted by Guardian Australia about the legal information it provided to customers, Target removed all e-scooter models and one hoverboard for sale from its website.</p>
      <p>JB HiFi and Harvey Norman did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
