      <h1>Lil Jon Claims He Was Detained in Vietnam Over His Jewelry</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T19:53:48+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 19:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xxlmag.com/author/cvernoncoleman/" target="_blank">C. Vernon Coleman II</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/tags/lil-jon/">Lil Jon</a>'s expensive taste recently caused some issues for the producer/rapper while he was traveling through Vietnam.</p>
      <p>On Friday night (Nov. 15), Jon claims he was stopped and detained for his jewelry. He shared the evidence of the incident via his Instagram story.</p>
      <p>"Vietnam got me hemmed up over my iceeeee smh," he posted along with a photo of a desk and chair.</p>

      <p>The next photo the Atlanta-native shared showed his jewelry laid out on display, while three men appear to be talking. Jon posted "BRUHHHHHH" on the photo along with a surprised emoji.</p>

      <p>It appears Lil Jon was able to get out. Several hours later, he updated fans on the situation.</p>
      <p>"Got detained n Vietnam and had to call the U.S. Embassy to come to my rescue," he posted along with a photo with the people who assisted in his release. "Thanks to these two for getting me out."</p>
      <p>It appears Jon was able to make it out in time to make his gig at Club Cubic in Zhuhai, China.</p>

      <p>Lil Jon knows a little bit about too much ice. Back in 2007, he <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/xxl-magazine/2007/03/lil-jon-sets-guinness-world-record/">set the Guinness World Record for largest diamond pendant</a> with his King of Crunk chain. Costing $500,000, the chain is 7.5 inches tall and weighs 5.11 pounds. It featured 73 diamond carats.</p>
      <p>Jon was released following the mix-up in Vietnam on the 15th <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2016/11/lil-jon-east-side-boyz-crunk-juice-album/">anniversary</a> of Lil Jon &amp; The Eastside Boyz's <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Crunk-Juice-Explicit-Lil-Jon/dp/B004S8Y5V0?SubscriptionId=AKIAJYPOGEBYCEUS42SQ&amp;tag=xxlmagtsm-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=B004S8Y5V0">Crunk Juice</a></i> album.</p>

      <p>"My house was $3.7 million. Then I put about $600,000 into it. That's the most I've ever spent, but I look at it as a good investment. At the end of the day, that shit already went up in value. It could be there for the kids. I don't feel like I'm playing myself no more. Just paying rent was never feeling good anyways."</p>
      <p>"Other than that, trips. Hawaii trips. I bring homies with me. I usually go like five to seven deep. It'll cost sometimes if I go on a trip. Sometimes it's around $80,000 to $100,000. Spend 100 racks on a trip, that's something you can never lose. Your watch can get taken from you, your chain can get taken, you can go to jail and they can take your home, but memories are forever."</p>
