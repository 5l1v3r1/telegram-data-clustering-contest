      <p><b>Pecco Bagnaia won't race in Valencia tomorrow</b>. A bad fall in the FP3, when exiting the pit lane, caused a micro fracture to his right wrist and a head injury. <b>Tests ruled out complications, but the blow to his head was really hard (the Pramac rider still remembers nothing of the accident), so doctors decided to stop him as a precaution.</b></p>
      <p>"<i>It was a bad fall but, fortunately, there were no serious consequences</i>," Bagnaia explained. "<i><b>We'll try to understand what happened, but the most important thing now is to recover and get back on track for the tests.</b> I would like to extend a big thank you to the Mobile Clinic, to Dorna's medical staff, and to all those who helped me</i>."</p>
