      <h1>ESPN’s Josina Anderson apologizes for Mason Rudolph ‘private parts’ tweet</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T19:24:44+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 19:24</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Fischer</a></address>
      <p>ESPN reporter Josina Anderson apologized Saturday for her tweet that chastised Mason Rudolph for allegedly grabbing Myles Garrett’s “private parts” <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/myles-garrett-suspended-indefinitely-for-browns-steelers-fight/">during the Browns-Steelers brawl Thursday night.</a></p>
      <p>“What word would be used to describe this if an NFL player grabbed a female’s private parts in a non-consensual way? Pause,” she wrote in the since-deleted tweet following the Browns’ 21-7 win over the Steelers. “Would that be assault? Male or female, this nonconsensual act right here is beyond invasive, provoking and wrong.”</p>
      <p>Anderson shared a photo from the game that showed Rudolph and Garrett tangled up after Garrett hit Rudolph over the head with the Steelers quarterback’s helmet following an on-the-field scuffle between the two players near the end of the game.</p>
      <p>Anderson used an arrow to point to Rudolph’s left hand, seemingly implying he grabbed Garrett’s crotch-area.</p>
      <p>“Mistakes need to be owned, and I will own mine here,” <a href="https://twitter.com/JosinaAnderson/status/1195698921579958273?s=20">Anderson tweeted Saturday</a>. “With the benefit of additional angles, it’s clear my tweet misinterpreted one of the photos taken during the brawl. That’s my fault, I apologize. My goal is to always be completely accurate and fair.”<br/>Garrett was suspended for the remainder of the season and playoffs, at a minimum, without pay, and Rudolph, who was not injured in the incident, is expected to be fined, <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001077016/article/mason-rudolph-will-be-fined-for-role-in-tnf-brawl">according to NFL Network.</a></p>
      <p>Pittsburgh’s Maurkice Pouncey (three games) and Cleveland’s Larry Ogunjobi (one game) were also suspended without pay for their roles in the fight.</p>
