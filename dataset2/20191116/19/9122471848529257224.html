      <h1>Breaking: The Colin Kaepernick Workout Is Reportedly Being Moved</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T19:43:42+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 19:43</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick has a workout scheduled for this afternoon in front of several NFL scouts. Although the workout is supposed to take place very soon, the location of the workout has been changed at the last minute.</p>
      <p>Kaepernick hasn’t played in the NFL since the 2016 season. He’s expected to throw for scouts and then interview with teams.</p>
      <p>The workout was originally slated for 3 p.m. today at the Falcons’ training facility, but that is no longer the plan.</p>
      <p>According to ESPN insider Adam Schefter, the workout is getting moved to an alternative location in Atlanta this afternoon. It’ll be open to the media and all NFL representatives.</p>
      <p>Schefter is reporting that the NFL originally declined to allow media and cameras.</p>
      <p>With the location for the workout now moved to a different facility, the league has pushed back the start time to 4 p.m. ET.</p>
      <p>Here’s the official announcement from Kaepernick’s team. The quarterback is simply asking for transparency from the NFL and everyone who covers the workout:</p>

      <p>It turns out that Kaepernick originally requested for the league to have the media there to observe his workout.</p>
      <p>“Based on the prior conduct by the NFL league office, Mr. Kaepernick simply asks for a transparent and open process which is why a new location has been requested for today,” Kaepernick’s team said in his statement. “Mr. Kaepernick looks forward to seeing the representatives from the clubs today.”</p>
      <p>Stay tuned for the latest on this situation.</p>
