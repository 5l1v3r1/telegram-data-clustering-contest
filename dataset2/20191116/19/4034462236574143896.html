      <h1>Final Chevrolet Corvette C7 Rolls Off The Production Line</h1>
      <h2>Say goodbye to front-engined Corvettes forever.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T19:10:53+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 19:10</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Bigg</a></address>
      <p>It's the end of an era. 66 years after the original C1 Corvette was introduced in 1953, the final front-engined Corvette has rolled off the assembly line. A photo posted on Twitter by Chevrolet shows the last-ever C7 Corvette at the Bowling Green Assembly Plant. Finished in black, it's based on the potent <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/chevrolet/corvette-z06">Z06 model</a> and is equipped with the 3LZ trim package and the Z07 Performance Package, which adds Brembo carbon-ceramic brakes, level 3 aerodynamics, and Michelin Pilot Sport Cup tires.</p>
      <p>If you were hoping to own this commemorative C7 Corvette, you're out of luck because it was recently <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/final-c7-corvette-sold-for-millions">sold at a Barrett-Jackson charity auction for an eye-watering $2.7 million</a>, setting a new record for an automaker-donated car. That's significantly more than the C7 Corvette Z06's original $80,900 starting price.</p>

      <p>All proceeds will go to the Stephen Siller Tunnel to Towers Foundation, which supports America's first responders and seriously injured service members. The foundation builds mortgage-free homes for service members and pays off the mortgages for families of first responders that were killed in action.</p>
      <p>The C7 Corvette Z06 is powered by a supercharged 6.2-liter V8 producing 650 horsepower and 650 lb-ft of torque. 0-62 mph takes 3.2 seconds before the Z06 tops out at 195 mph. The final example is equipped with a seven-speed manual transmission, but the Z06 was also offered with an optional eight-speed automatic.</p>

      <p>Replacing the C7 Corvette is the new mid-engined C8 Corvette, which starts production next February after suffering a delay. Currently, the only available model is the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/chevrolet/corvette">entry-level Stingray model</a>, which packs a naturally-aspirated 6.2-liter V8 generating 495 horsepower and 470 lb-ft of torque.</p>
      <p>Eventually, a new, more powerful Z06 will join the lineup, which is <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/c8-corvette-z06-details-are-here-and-they-re-incredible">rumored to have a twin-turbo V8 based on the Blackwing engine</a> with an output of over 800 horsepower and 700 lb-ft of torque, but it isn't expected to arrive until 2020.</p>
