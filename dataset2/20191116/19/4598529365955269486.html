      <p>The White House is defending senior adviser Stephen Miller following newly unearthed emails showing <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/leaked-emails-highlight-how-stephen-miller-boosted-white-nationalist-propaganda">efforts to peddle white nationalist propaganda</a> shortly before he joined the Trump campaign.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, The Southern Poverty Law Center-run blog <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2019/11/12/stephen-millers-affinity-white-nationalism-revealed-leaked-emails">Hatewatch </a>published a series of emails dated 2015 between Miller, who served as an aide to ex-Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) at the time, and former Breitbart writer Katie McHugh that contain links and references to far-right websites focused on immigration and “immigrant crime.”</p>
      <p>In a statement obtained by <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/470691-white-house-backs-stephen-miller-amid-white-nationalist-emails">The Hill</a> Saturday, White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley defended Miller and argued that the report demonstrates an anti-Semitic attack by the left.</p>
      <p>“I work with Stephen. I know Stephen. He loves this country and hates bigotry in all forms – and it deeply concerns me as to why so many on the left consistently attack Jewish members of this Administration,” Gidley said in a statement obtained by <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/470691-white-house-backs-stephen-miller-amid-white-nationalist-emails">The Hill</a>.</p>
      <p>Gidley’s statement comes amid calls from Democratic lawmakers such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) <a href="https://act.ocasiocortez.com/signup/stephen_miller/?source=em20191113-323&amp;t=4&amp;akid=323%2E95995%2EfEw2RQ">calling</a> for Miller to resign.</p>
      <p>Soon after the SPLC’s report broke on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham attacked the SPLC, saying that the organization is “beneath public discussion.”</p>
      <p>“We have not seen the report,” she said in a Tuesday statement. “The SPLC, however, is an utterly-discredited, long-debunked far-left smear organization that has recently been forced – to its great humiliation – to issue a major retraction for other wholly fabricated accusations.”</p>
