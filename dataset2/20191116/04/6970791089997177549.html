      <p>Rodney’s attorney has since <a href="https://people.com/crime/kim-kardashian-rodney-reed-stay-of-execution/">confirmed the massive news</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>Reed’s lawyer, Bryce Benjet, did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment, but said in a <a href="https://time.com/5722795/rodney-reed-innocent-execution-protests/">statement to <i>TIME</i></a>, “We are extremely relieved and thankful that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has issued a stay of execution for our client Rodney Reed.” “This opportunity will allow for proper consideration of the powerful and mounting new evidence of Mr. Reed’s innocence,” his statement added. (PEOPLE)</blockquote>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/us/rodney-reed-texas-execution.html">stay of execution</a> comes following weeks of people pulling for Rodney Reed to receive a new trial for a crime evidence appears to prove he didn’t commit.</p>
      <blockquote>A Texas prisoner who has long claimed his innocence in the murder of a woman 23 years ago was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/us/rodney-reed-death-row-texas.html?module=inline">days away from his execution</a> on Friday when an appeals court stepped in to suspend his death sentence indefinitely.  The dramatic decision by the Court of Criminal Appeals in Texas halted the execution of the prisoner, Rodney Reed, and ordered the court where he was originally tried to consider new evidence in the case, including testimony from eyewitnesses who have come forward in recent months pointing toward the victim’s fiancé as another suspect. (New York Times)</blockquote>
      <p>According to reports, Reed <a href="https://www.sohh.com/meek-mill-t-i-beg-fans-to-help-free-rodney-reed-hell-be-executed-for-a-crime-he-didnt-commit/">has remained in prison</a> for over 20 years and just recently someone allegedly confessed to doing the crime he’s been convicted for.</p>
      <blockquote>Less than a month before <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/11/us/texas-rodney-reed-hearing-death-row-stories-new-evidence/index.html">Rodney Reed</a> is set to be executed in Texas, a former prison inmate claims someone else confessed to the murder that sent Reed to prison. Reed has spent more than 21 years on death row for the 1996 murder of Stacey Stites in Bastrop, Texas. Police say Reed assaulted, raped and strangled Stites, but he insists he’s innocent. He is set to be executed on November 20.Former inmate Arthur Snow Jr. filed an affidavit in court earlier this week saying Stites’ fiancé, Jimmy Fennell, confessed to the murder years ago.
