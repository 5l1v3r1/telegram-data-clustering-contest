      <p><b>WWE Smackdown Result Friday Night:</b> During an appearance on ‘Miz TV,’ Daniel Bryan’s verbal altercation with Bray Wyatt and the Firefly Fun House led to a Universal Championship showdown at Survivor Series.</p>
      <p>One week after Universal Champion ‘The Fiend’ Bray Wyatt attacked Daniel Bryan, The Miz welcomed his longtime rival to appear on ‘Miz TV,’ questioning the former WWE Champion on his mental state following the onslaught.</p>
      <p>A fired-up Bryan acknowledged his own mental instability but expressed his belief that it somehow puts him on common ground with the equally unstable Wyatt. The interview was soon interrupted by Wyatt and his Firefly Fun House friends, Abby The Witch, Huskus The Pig Boy, Mercy The Buzzard and Rambling Rabbit. As Wyatt pulled his new blue Universal Championship out of the toy box, Bryan participated in a “Yes and No” back and forth.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, The Beard challenged Bray to a Universal Title Match at Survivor Series, to which the smiling Wyatt responded with a resounding “Yes!”</p>
