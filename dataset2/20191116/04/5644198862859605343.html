      <p>Inter Milan and Belgium striker Romelu Lukaku said he had anticipated having to deal with racism when he moved to Italy's Serie A at the start of the season and wants tougher action from Uefa, European football's controlling body, to root it out.</p>
      <p>ST PETERSBURG: Inter Milan and Belgium striker Romelu Lukaku said he had anticipated having to deal with racism when he moved to Italy's Serie A at the start of the season and wants tougher action from Uefa, European football's controlling body, to root it out.</p>
      <p>"I knew it would happen. I was prepared because I had spoken to other footballers about it," the striker said in a rare appearance before the media in St Petersburg on Friday, on the eve of Belgium's Euro 2020 match against hosts Russia.</p>

      <p>"Uefa have to act to stamp it out. You can hold up a board that says, 'No to Racism,' but it makes no sense if no action is taken."</p>
      <p>Lukaku was the target of offensive chants from the home crowd in Cagliari in September, his second match in Italy, which he condemned in a social media post.</p>
      <p>Racism has been a long-running problem in Italian football and authorities have been criticised for not taking strong enough action.</p>
      <p>"But I'm having a good time in Italy. The people on the street are very good to me and it's on that, that I want to focus," Lukaku told reporters.</p>
      <p>Lukaku, whose father was an international for the then Zaire (now Democratic Republic of Congo), moved to Inter Milan in August from Manchester United for a reported transfer fee of around 80 million euros (US$88 million).</p>
