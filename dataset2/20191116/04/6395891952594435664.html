      <p><b>HOMESTEAD, Fla.Â (AP)</b> - Matt Crafton won a championship without winning a race, an unprecedented feat under NASCAR's new title-deciding playoff systems.</p>
      <p>Crafton finished second in Friday night's Truck Series finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway - good enough for his third series title in the winner-take-all format. The champion needed only to finish highest of the foursome of Crafton, reigning series champion Bret Moffitt, Stewart Friesen and Ross Chastain to win the title.</p>
      <p>Crafton's winless streak dates 58 races, to 2017 at Eldora, but the 43-year-old did not need the victory to claim the title. Chastain finished fourth, Moffitt fifth and Friesen 11th.</p>
      <p>"I finally got out of the wheelchair and got up on the wheel and got it done," said Crafton, who trails only Hall of Famer Ron Hornaday Jr.'s four series titles.</p>
      <p>"It's one step closer to what Hornaday has done and they called us the underdog."</p>
      <p>Crafton in a Ford from ThorSport Racing was the underdog even though Crafton was the most experienced driver in the championship field.</p>
      <p>The last driver to win a title without winning a race was Austin Dillon in the Xfinity Series in 2013, before the current elimination-style format.</p>
      <p>Austin Hill won the race driving for Hattori Racing Enterprises, the team Moffitt won the title with last season. Hill was eliminated from the playoffs in the last round.</p>
      <p>Crafton won consecutive titles in 2013 and 2014 under a different points format. He has three total victories in his three championship seasons, and all three of his championships are with ThorSport.</p>
      <p>Joe Nemechek set the national series record with his 1,186 start. The previous mark was held by Richard Petty, who made all his starts in the Cup Series.</p>
