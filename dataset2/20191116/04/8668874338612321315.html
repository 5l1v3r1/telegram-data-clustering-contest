      <p>Speaking to <i>Newstalk ZB</i> while promoting his his new biography ‘<i>Straight 8</i>‘, Read named two former teammates who he labelled as “intimidating” to play against in his early years as a professional rugby player.</p>

      <p>“Certainly when you come up against <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/toulouse/players/jerome-kaino/">Jerome Kaino</a> and Jerry Collins when I first came along, that was someone where I was like ‘man this guy is intimidating’. Those two probably [are the toughest].”</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old also showed some of his personality in the wide-ranging interview as he revealed his love for golf and music, two hobbies he’ll look to indulge in before moving to <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/japan">Japan</a> to join Top League club Toyota Verblitz.</p>
      <p>“I enjoy golf but I haven’t been able to play it to be honest for the last few years with my injuries … I’m up and down as everyone is. I’m looking forward to getting into that again.</p>

      <p>“Also I love music actually. It’s probably the thing I escape with.</p>
      <p>“Probably [my favourite] band is The Killers. But I love The Beatles. Tom Petty I absolutely love as well.”</p>
      <p>Read also dropped a hint as to what the future holds for him once his playing days are over.</p>
      <p>“I’m unsure exactly,” he said of his post-rugby ambitions.</p>
      <p>“But I do enjoy sport. I studied towards that and leadership as well. Wellbeing is what I’m interested in. So not necessarily something in sport but something around leadership would be ideal for me. I’m exploring a few different options in that area.”</p>
