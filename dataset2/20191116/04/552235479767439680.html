      <h1>Government must act after Glasgow hospital water infection scandal</h1>
      <h2>Record View slams NHSGGC's 'wall of secrecy' amid the Milly Main scandal.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T04:30:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Record View, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/record-view/</a></address>
      <p>The £842million <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/claims-emerge-cancer-kid-died-20876487">Queen Elizabeth University Hospital</a> was an exciting project and long overdue for patients in the west of Scotland.</p>
      <p>It was hoped the state-of-the-art facility would serve patients and staff well. But the QEUH has been a disaster for patient safety and should never have opened.</p>
      <p>Water at the facility was contaminated and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/heartbroken-mum-reveals-child-cancer-20889570">patients died</a> after contracting infections linked to bird droppings.</p>
      <p>This week we <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/snp-health-secretary-known-child-20882914">exposed a new low</a>. A whisteblower came forward to say that 26 child cancer patients had acquired infections believed to have orginated from the hospital water supply.</p>
      <p>One of the kids, the probe found, died after contracting a water-based bacteria.</p>

      <p>Kimberly Darroch has today come forward to say she believes her daughter Milly was the child who died.</p>
      <p>The brave mum said Milly was in remission and set to leave hospital but contracted the infection and died.</p>
      <p>She believes there has been a cover up and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde are responsible for this wall of secrecy. She added: “I think they knew prior to Milly’s death that the water was contaminated and they knew this was the infection that killed my daughter.”</p>
      <p>Her harrowing story shames this appalling health board and the Government must act.</p>

      <h3>Nicola Sturgeon knows her pitch at this election is a major gamble.</h3>
      <p>She is pushing for independence in a country that voted no in 2014 and to stay in Europe when the UK is heading out.</p>
      <p>In the north-east today, Sturgeon knows a considerable number of voters are more than happy to get shot of Brussels. They also returned a swathe of Tory MPs in 2017, in part, as a reaction to independence.</p>
      <p>But her central pitch is clear – Boris Johnson must go.</p>
      <p>Tories in seats across Scotland used to have a leader who wanted to stay in Europe. Suddenly they can’t get enough of Johnson’s lack of principles, political maturity or common sense.</p>
      <p>The Tory claim that fishing communities will magically transform with Brexit is far-fetched.</p>
      <p>Theresa May was given a chance in Scots constituencies two years ago, and she blew it – don’t let Johnson make it even worse.</p>

      <h3>Gerry Cinnamon has achieved levels of fame few acts can hope for.</h3>
      <p>By selling out Hampden Park in four hours, he has made Scottish history.</p>
      <p>But it’s the way he’s done it, by word of mouth, his fans and on his own terms, that makes him truly special.</p>
