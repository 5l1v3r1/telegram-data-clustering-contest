      <h3>PRICE TAG REVEALED</h3>
      <p>Peterborough United have reportedly put a £13m price tag on striker Ivan Toney - a player repeatedly linked with a move to Derby County.</p>
      <p>Toney has netted 12 goals in 20 appearances for the League One Posh, having scored 23 during the 2018-19 campaign.</p>
      <p>He and Peterborough teammate Marcus Maddison were linked with <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">Derby</a> earlier in the campaign, while Posh owner Darragh MacAnthony took to Twitter earlier this week to pour cold water on <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/derby-county-transfer-rumour-addressed-3535594">speculation that the pair had been spotted at the Rams'</a> Moor Farm training ground.</p>
      <p>Premier League duo Bournemouth and Burnley are among the other clubs to have reportedly been targeting a move for Toney in the past, alongside Middlesbrough and Bristol City.</p>
      <p>And amid speculation, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10345811/peterborough-13m-ivan-toney-bournemouth-burnley/">The Sun are now suggesting</a> that Peterborough would ask for £13m to sell the League One hotshot.</p>

      <h3>SHINNIE MAKES TRANSFER ADMISSION</h3>

      <p>Derby County midfielder <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/graeme-shinnie">Graeme Shinnie</a> has opened up on the struggles he has faced with the Rams – and even admitted he considered leaving Pride Park.</p>
      <p>Shinnie was signed by <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">Derby</a> last season on a pre-contract agreement ahead of his deal with former club Aberdeen that expired in the summer.</p>
      <p>When that deal was finalised, <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/frank-lampard">Frank Lampard</a> was manager of the Rams, who then went on to replace Maurizio Sarri as Chelsea boss.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/phillip-cocu">Phillip Cocu</a> stepped into the former England international’s shoes, but took time to include Shinnie in his starting line-ups.</p>
      <p>Shinnie did not feature in the Championship until the 2-0 win over Luton Town at the start of October, when he played 76 minutes of the clash at Pride Park.</p>
      <p>The Scotland international had not been included in the matchday squads of five of Derby’s previous 10 league matches, and was regularly with Darren Wassall’s under-23s outfit.</p>
      <p>But the 28-year-old has played a part in each of Derby’s last six league fixtures, and netted a stoppage time winner against Wigan Athletic last month to bag his first goal for the Rams.</p>
      <p>Fresh from earning a call-up to the Scotland national team, Shinnie admits he considered leaving Derby after being forced to watch some matches from the stands during the early stages of his Rams career.</p>
      <p>However, he insists he did not believe he had made a mistake in moving to Pride Park.</p>

      <p>There has been an update on the reported interest from <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">Derby County</a> in DC United midfielder <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/who-luciano-acosta-profile-dc-3533464">Luciano Acosta</a> .</p>
      <p>In an <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/derby-county-transfer-news-lucharoo-3530596">interview in Argentina</a> , Acosta claimed his former DC United team-mate, Derby-bound <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/wayne-rooney">Wayne Rooney</a> , had told him to join him at Pride Park.</p>
      <p>Rooney joins the Rams as a player-coach in January after spending nearly two years in the United States with the MLS outfit.</p>
      <p>Acosta has also called time on his DC United career, and is looking for a new club.</p>
      <p>Fresh reports in <a href="https://theathletic.co.uk/?source=googleuksearchads&amp;ad_id=394570647773&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIw-3n-rLs5QIVh7PtCh1MvQ-zEAAYASABEgJf_PD_BwE">The Athletic</a> claim that Acosta is “waiting for the call” from Derby over a potential move, but there has been no sign from the Rams that deal could take place.</p>
      <p>The report also adds that Acosta could be “leveraging his situation in order to get a better deal”, with Boca Juniors also reportedly in the running for his signature.</p>

      <h3>YOUNGSTERS WHO COULD SAVE RAMS MILLIONS</h3>

      <p>Derby County are no doubt preparing to use the forthcoming <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/derby-county-transfer-news-toney-3542124">January transfer window</a> to bolster their squad and push for a strong second half of the season.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">Rams</a> are currently 16th in the Sky Bet Championship after an up-and-down start to Phillip Cocu’s first season in charge.</p>
      <p>Clubs in the Premier League and the Championship are currently in the midst of the final international break of the year, with the Rams back in action with a home game against high-flying Preston North End on November 23.</p>
      <p>After that, Derby face a gruelling run of fixtures up until January that could make or break their season.</p>
      <p>As such, the <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/derby-county-january-transfer-staff-3317854">transfer market</a> may be a way of increasing the club’s chances of success this season – but what about players already at Pride Park that could save the Rams the trouble of venturing into the unknown realm of the January transfer window?</p>
      <p>We take a look at some of the club's youngsters who could save Derby millions in the transfer market.</p>

      <h3>PLAYERS WHO NEED A MOVE</h3>

      <p>There are a number of players in the <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">Derby County</a> squad that have <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/derby-county-transfer-news-shinnie-3541480">not been seeing that much first-team action</a> .</p>
      <p>Rams boss Phillip Cocu is in his first season at Pride Park, and has been spending the first few months in the job figuring out what his best starting line-up is.</p>
      <p>Some players have been featured regularly, while others have had to settle for a place on the bench, or perhaps not even a part of the matchday squad at all.</p>
      <p>Others have also been working their way back from respective injuries, and are yet to get fully match fit.</p>
      <p>We take a look at which Rams players could do with a spell on loan in the <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/derby-county-transfer-news-toney-3541044">January transfer window</a> for one reason or another.</p>
