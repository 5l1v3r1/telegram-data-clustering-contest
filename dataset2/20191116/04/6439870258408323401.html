      <p>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (WBTV) - The chilly temperatures and chance for wet weather didn’t keep fans from showing up at the NCISAA Division 2 State Football Championship Friday night. The game was held at Providence Day School in south Charlotte.</p>
      <p>“It’s my senior year. It’s our last game so I’m excited – championship, so it should be a good game,” said Providence Day student Brent Daniel.</p>
      <p>The forecast called for temperatures in the 40s and a chance of rain, but fans came to the game prepared. Several people were spotted with blankets and umbrellas.</p>
      <p>“We have leggings under our pants. We have like five layers. We are all bundled up with umbrellas and everything,” said Taylor Dixon, a student at Metrolina Christian Academy.</p>
      <p>Tuwanna Bingley told WBTV she traveled from Savannah, Georgia to watch her husband’s nephew play in the big game. She said the weather was definitely a concern as she traveled to the game.</p>
      <p>“We’re coming up from Savannah so we were a bit worried so hence my snowsuit. I’m not too used to the cold,” explained Bingley.</p>
      <p>One student explained that the Providence Day faithful had planned for the cold temps.</p>
      <p>“Our theme this week was ‘ski’ to prepare for the weather so I’m wearing leggings, boots, a ski jacket, gloves, and a helmet,” said Providence Day student Madeline Alt.</p>
      <p>Providence Day won the game 28-13 over Metrolina Christian Academy.</p>
