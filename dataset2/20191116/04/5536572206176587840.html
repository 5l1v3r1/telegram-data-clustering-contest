      <h1>Myles Garrett Smashing Helmet Over Mason Rudolph’s Head Gets The ‘Jim Ross’ Treatment (VIDEO)</h1>

      <p>The massive fight between the Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers has already been dealt with by the league office as they handed out fines and suspensions to the parties that thought deserved it.</p>
      <p>The fight started when Garrett took Rudolph to the ground following the quarterback’s short pass to Trey Edmunds with just seconds left to play in 4th quarter.</p>
      <p>Rudolph appeared to attempt to dislodge Garrett’s helmet, but his failure prompted Garrett to take his off and smash him with it.</p>
      <p>That moment has now been given the Jim Ross treatment.</p>

      <p>“Last night, I made a terrible mistake. I lost my cool and what I did was selfish and unacceptable,” Garrett’s statement said. “I know that we are all responsible for our actions and I can only prove my true character through my actions moving forward. I want to apologize to Mason Rudolph, my teammates, our entire organization, our fans and to the NFL. I know have to be accountable for what happened, learn from my mistake and I fully intend to do so.”</p>
