      <h2>The win snaps a three-game losing skid for Kitchener, who visits London Sunday</h2>

      <p>With a 15-year old exceptional status player in the building, it was the veterans that proved to be exceptional when the Kitchener Rangers needed it most.</p>
      <p>Reid Valade scored in the fourth round of the shootout, and Lucas Pfeil stopped Zayde Wisdom to clinch a 4-3 win over the Kingston Frontenacs Friday night at The Aud.</p>
      <p>Jonathan Yantsis became the first Ranger to reach 10 goals this season, opening the scoring on a tap in with just over two minutes left in the first period.</p>
      <p>He would score his second of the night with 15 seconds left in regulation to force overtime.</p>
      <p>Greg Meireles made quite the return, scoring the other Ranger goal in the second period to give his team a two-goal lead, as well as adding an assist to Yantsis' late-game heroics.</p>
      <p>Axel Bergkvist put up a two-assist effort, and in his 200th career OHL game, Riley Damiani extended his point streak to four games with an assist.</p>
      <p>Dawson Baker and Wisdom scored 35 seconds apart late in the second to tie the game at two, before Dustin Hutton gave the lowly Frontenacs a 3-2 lead halfway through the third.</p>
      <p>Shane Wright was held off the scoresheet for Kingston, but scored in the shootout.</p>
      <p>Pfeil made 20 saves in the win, while Christian Propp stopped 31 shots in his Kingston debut and took the loss.</p>
      <p>Kitchener is in London on Sunday afternoon for their first meeting against the Knights.</p>
      <p>Pregame starts at 1:30 p.m. on 570 NEWS.</p>
