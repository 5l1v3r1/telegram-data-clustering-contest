      <h1>Vontaze Burfict rejects Myles Garrett comparison, blasts Roger Goodell</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T04:05:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 04:05</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Gutierrez</a></address>
      <p>ALAMEDA, Calif. -- <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/oak/oakland-raiders">Oakland Raiders</a> linebacker <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15246/vontaze-burfict">Vontaze Burfict</a>, suspended for the season after Week 4 for what the NFL deemed an accumulation of dirty play, sounded off Friday about the league's disciplinary system in the wake of <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-browns">Cleveland Browns</a> edge rusher <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3122132/myles-garrett">Myles Garrett</a>'s indefinite suspension, including some harsh words for commissioner Roger Goodell.</p>
      <p>"The NFL had to suspend somebody for that last night, since that wasn't a football act," Burfict <a href="https://theathletic.com/1382826/2019/11/15/exclusive-exiled-raiders-linebacker-vontaze-burfict-weighs-in-on-myles-garrett-and-blasts-the-nfl/">told The Athletic</a>. "My suspension was a football act. I was hitting somebody. I wasn't taking a helmet off and swinging it at somebody."</p>
      <p>Burfict told The Athletic he was watching Thursday's game with his daughters, ages 4 and 2, and turned it off after the fight, in which Garrett hit <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/pit/pittsburgh-steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> quarterback <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116407/mason-rudolph">Mason Rudolph</a> with his helmet with seconds left in the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>"I don't want them to see that," Burfict said. "Because that's not what I do. That's not part of football. I hit people on the field during the game. And they say that's dirty, yeah, whatever. I get hit, too, during the games, so don't complain. It's football, bro."</p>
      <p>After the Raiders' game at the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ind/indianapolis-colts">Indianapolis Colts</a> on Sept. 29, when Burfict was ejected following a hit on tight end <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16504/jack-doyle">Jack Doyle</a>, he avoided reporters in the locker room by putting on his headphones and blowing past them. Nearly two months later, Burfict had a lot to get off his chest.</p>
      <p>"It was bulls---," Burfict said of the discipline for his hit on Doyle. "I was making a football play. I could see if it was a fine or something, but not a suspension, let alone for the whole season. It kind of seems like there was a target on my head. I mean, there has always been a target on my head.</p>
      <p>"There have been times in games when a ref is cussing at me and wanting me to cuss back at him so he can throw me out of the game. Come on, bro. I don't want to be out there playing against the refs and the opposing team."</p>
      <p>Earlier this season, Raiders defensive coordinator Paul Guenther, a close friend of Burfict's from their time together in <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/cin/cincinnati-bengals">Cincinnati</a>, said the Raiders probably would not have signed Burfict had they known he was one penalty away from a seasonlong suspension.</p>
      <p>Burfict told The Athletic he was not informed that he was on his final strike.</p>
      <p>"They didn't, and it really doesn't matter," he said. "I see other players make that same kind of play on a daily basis. It was a witch hunt. They were watching everything I do. They watched 171 of my plays this year. Tell me if they watched 171 plays of that linebacker from the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/lac/los-angeles-chargers">Chargers</a>, what's his name, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/8429/thomas-davis-sr">Thomas Davis</a>? Go witch hunt him."</p>
      <p>Burfict, who was on a one-year contract with Oakland, said he wants to play next season. His comments about Goodell and unsuccessful appeal of his suspension, though, might be problematic.</p>
      <p>"I met Roger Goodell in New York, and he was a total b----," Burfict said. "He was a b----. He didn't let anybody speak. He rushed us in and out of the meeting. The meeting was bulls---. He already had the suspension in his hand."</p>
      <p>Burfict said he showed video of clean plays that he had made, plus dirty plays against him that weren't called and that he didn't retaliate to.</p>
      <p>"They didn't give a f--- about that s---," Burfict said.</p>
      <p>Raiders coach Jon Gruden and quarterback <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16757/derek-carr">Derek Carr</a> spoke on Burfict's behalf during a conference call.</p>
      <p>"That meant a lot to me, but the NFL didn't give a f--- about that s--- either," Burfict said. "Derek Carr, my guy, said his piece about how I was a captain and a great teammate and not a dirty player, and [appeals officer] Derrick Brooks almost cut him off. He said we appreciate you coming on the call, but they didn't need Derek Carr to vouch for me.</p>
      <p>"Brooks made his mind up already. They let me know before I woke up the next day. They didn't even go in the office, make some coffee and discuss it for a few minutes."</p>
