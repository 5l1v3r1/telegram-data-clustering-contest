      <h1>Roy Keane talks up Man United striker Marcus Rashford</h1>
      <h2>Roy Keane says Manchester United striker Marcus Rashford has rediscovered his confidence in recent weeks</h2>

      <h3>Roy Keane has claimed that Marcus Rashford has rediscovered his confidence after he helped to fire England to a 7-0 win over Montenegro on Thursday night.</h3>
      <p>The Manchester United striker got on the score-sheet at Wembley as he helped Gareth Southgate’s men to claim three points and secure their spot at Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>Rashford and most of his Manchester United team-mates have struggled to find consistent form for most of the current campaign and the Red Devils are down in seventh place in the Premier League table.</p>
      <p>However, Rashford impressed alongside his England team-mates on Thursday night and he has now scored six goals in his last seven appearances for club and country.</p>
      <p>And former Manchester United captain Keane feels that Rashford has rediscovered his confidence in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <i>ITV Sport</i> on Thursday night, Keane said: “He looks like he has got his confidence back, I think in the last month or so.</p>
      <p>“And what players have to remember, when we’ve been criticising them before, there’s a compliment in there because we believe he’s a really good player.</p>
      <p>“His confidence is up and running again and he looks back to his best.”</p>
      <p>Rashford has scored nine goals in all competitions for Manchester United so far this season.</p>
      <p>The young striker will be hoping to feature for the Red Devils when they return to Premier League action after the international break with a trip to Sheffield United next Sunday.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils have so far only managed to win four of their opening 12 Premier League games under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.</p>
