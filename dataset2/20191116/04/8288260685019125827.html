      <h3>Liverpool ticket fury</h3>
      <p>Aston Villa have been criticised for the ticket prices against Liverpool after details for the Carabao Cup quarter-final tie were released.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> take on the Reds in the final eight of the competition on Tuesday, December 17 at Villa Park.</p>
      <p>The clash has been the subject of intense interest since the draw was confirmed, because of Liverpool’s involvement in the Club World Cup the same week.</p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp’s side play in the semi-final of the tournament in Qater under 24 hours after facing Villa.</p>

      <h3>Kalinic sale 'sanctioned'</h3>
      <p>Aston Villa boss Dean Smith has been given the green light to sell Lovre Kalinic this summer, according to reports.</p>
      <p>It is less than a year since the Croatia international made the move to B6, but he has endured a nightmare spell at Villa Park, with both parties now willing to cut their losses.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.footballinsider247.com/smith-gives-green-light-for-aston-villa-to-sell-his-signing/">Football Insider</a> have reported that Smith is planning to shift the 29-year-old, who Villa signed for £7m last January.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> accept that they will struggle to recoup anything like the fee they paid for him, but are still keen to take him off the wage bill.</p>

      <h3>Villa's VAR response</h3>
      <p>Aston Villa are fully aware of fans’ frustrations over VAR – but there’s little they can do to improve the lack of clarity for supporters inside Villa Park.</p>
      <p>VAR has sparked controversy almost every weekend since its introduction into the Premier League at the start of the season.</p>
      <p>One the main complaints has been that fans inside the stadium are often left in the dark about what is going in with little communication about decisions that are being checked.</p>
      <p>A message is displayed on the big screen saying that a check is underway – but there is no more information given until the final decision is displayed.</p>

      <h3>Morelos fee will be 'ridiculous'</h3>
      <p>Alfredo Morelos is already worth ‘a small fortune’ as Premier League clubs circle around the Rangers striker.</p>
      <p>That’s the view of former Ibrox and <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Birmingham City</a> midfielder Barry Ferguson, who thinks the prolific striker could move for a ‘ridiculous’ fee amid speculation linking him to <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa.</a></p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/aston-villa-transfer-news-morelos-17257224">Villa have been credited with an interest in Morelos</a> in recent weeks as the January transfer window draws nearer.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old has already scored 22 goals this season in a brilliant campaign north of the border.</p>

      <h3>JT linked with Hearts</h3>
      <p>Hearts fans are loving talk a potential swoop for John Terry after the Aston Villa assistant was linked with the manager’s job.</p>
      <p>The Scottish Premiership side are on the hunt for a new boss after sacking former Scotland chief Craig Levein last month.</p>
      <p>And <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/john-terry">Terry</a> is being suggested as a possible successor after rising up the betting.</p>

      <h3>Back at it</h3>
      <p>After missing the last three games, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> skipper Jack Grealish looks to have returned to full training.</p>
      <p>Grealish has been out of action since the defeat against Manchester City last month. He was expected to return for the games against Liverpool and Wolves, must missed out on both as his calf injury was worse than first feared.</p>
      <p>However, with another eight days until Villa face Newcastle United, it appears that the claret and blue talisman is nearing a first team return.</p>
      <p>The club had suggested that Grealish was set to return to training at the back end of this week, but fears had been raised after several false dawns about his fitness.</p>

      <h3>On trial</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> youngster Easeh Suliman has been given a trial by Championship side QPR.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old will have a chance to impress Rangers bosses in a development game against Coventry City on Friday.</p>
      <p>Suliman was with Dean Smith’s first team during pre-season training, but the manager has still not considered him as part of his Premier League squad.</p>
      <p>Suliman started the game against the Sky Blues, ahead of what could be an extended trial with the West Londoners.</p>
