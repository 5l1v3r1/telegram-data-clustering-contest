      <h1>Nicola Sturgeon visits Scotland's pro-Brexit areas in bid to kick out Tories</h1>
      <h2>The SNP leader is gambling on a pro-independence pitch to sweep away Tory gains in the north-east.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T04:30:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Philip, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/andy-philip/</a></address>
      <p>Nicola Sturgeon is taking her election battle to Scotland’s key Brexit communities with a defiant call to kick out <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris</a> Johnson and escape economic harm.</p>
      <p>The SNP leader is touring the north-east where some communities, including traditional harbour towns, returned a much higher <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/rod-stewart-believes-scottish-independence-20887182">Leave</a> vote than the national average.</p>
      <p>Sturgeon’s party had dominated the region until a Tory resurgence at the last snap <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/alex-salmond-booted-out-gordon-10589386">election</a> in 2017.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Today, Sturgeon tells voters: “This upcoming election really matters. People across Scotland face the stark choice between the continued Brexit chaos of the Westminster parties, or the choice of a better future with Scotland as an independent country putting jobs, businesses and people’s livelihoods first. </p>
      <p>“The north-east of Scotland is a vital part of Scotland’s economy – but that is now under threat with it set to be the hardest hit part of the UK from a Tory Brexit.”</p>
      <p>The north-east, reliant on oil and fisheries, could be hit worst by a no-deal Brexit, according to recent analysis by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research.</p>
      <p>A report in September said the region could lose 6.3 per cent of economic output by around 2030.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Sturgeon will visit Arbroath, including the Angus town’s harbour, then campaign in Ellon, north of Aberdeen, taking in the town’s BrewDog craft brewery HQ.</p>
      <p>In 2016, all Scottish council areas voted to Remain in the EU. But pockets of the north east were heavily in favour of leaving. The SNP lost Angus to the Tories one year later after holding sway since the boundaries were set in 1997.</p>
      <p>Ellon is in the heart of Gordon, a seat lost by Alex Salmond to the Tories in 2017 and now firmly in the SNP’s sights.</p>
      <p>Aberdeenshire and Angus voted by around 55 per cent to stay in Europe. But independent research across constituencies suggests Banff and Buchan in the north-east corner was the only UK parliament seat in Scotland to vote Leave, while Angus was only around a point away from voting to quit.</p>
      <p>Sturgeon’s visit follows an official engagement in Dublin yesterday (FRI) where Sturgeon pushed the case for independence with leaders from Ireland, Wales and the UK Government.</p>
      <p>UK Government minister Colin Clark, who is defending the north-east seat of Gordon, said: “Breaking up the UK would create new and unnecessary barriers to trade within our biggest market.</p>
      <p>“The last thing our food and drink sector needs right now is more uncertainty.</p>
      <p>“Yet Nicola Sturgeon wants to hold not one, but two more referendums next year.”</p>
      <p>In Dublin, Sturgeon said: “I would support a second EU referendum, the SNP has made that very clear, but we’re not the principle decision-makers there and it remains far from certain whether that can happen.</p>
      <p>“If there is a UK government after the election that puts forward that proposition, the SNP would support it, but there’s no guarantee it would have a different outcome for Scotland. Even if it did, the next time Westminster decides to override the views of the Scottish people, we’re back to this point.</p>
      <p>“That’s why the fundamental solution is for Scotland, like Ireland, to be its own independent country.”</p>
