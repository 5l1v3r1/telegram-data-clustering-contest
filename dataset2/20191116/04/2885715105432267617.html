      <p>Following a Supreme Court order directing three states to compensate farmers who have refrained from <b><a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-why-it-is-unfair-to-blame-punjab-farmers-alone-for-the-pollution-in-delhi-6100612/">burning paddy stubble</a></b> on their fields, <b><a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/punjab-doles-out-bonus-to-paddy-farmers-will-claim-it-from-centre-6122286/">Punjab government is paying Rs 2,500</a></b> per acre. <i><a href="https://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a></i> explains how the government is zeroing in on those managed the stubble in an environment friendly way</p>
      <p>
        <b>How many farmers have applied for compensation?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The state government has received nearly 85,000 applications till date. The numbers are likely to go up as the last date for submission of these applications is November 30. The government has already disbursed disbursed Rs 19 crore among 29,343 non-basmati cultivating small and marginal farmers.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What is the criterion for selecting the farmers for the compensation?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Only small and marginal farmers having upto 5 acres of land, who had sown non-basmati paddy and who did not set ablaze their straw can seek compensation this year.</p>

      <p>
        <b>How are such farmers being identified?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The government has asked the farmers to seek compensation by submitting a self-declaration stating that they have not burnt the stubble and had instead followed an environment friendly way to manage it. The self declaration passes three counter checks. First, the panchayat of the applicantâ€™s village has to verify the claim. This is then referred to the village cooperative society that uploads the application online. The concerned SDM then checks it further by matching the claim with Punjab Remote Sensing Centre (PRSC) data coupled with the field visits.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How many acres were under paddy this season?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Paddy was sown in about 58 lakh acres this season. The farmers harvested about 160 lakh tonnes paddy. The government is expecting that they would have to disburse about Rs 500 crore as a majority of farmers have already set ablaze the paddy stubble to prepare the farms for the winter wheat crop.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How many farmers have upto 5 acres of land?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The number of small and marginal farmers having land holding upto 5 acres are about 6 lakh. The data of such farmers is available with the government.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How is the compensation been given?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The money is being released directly into the bank accounts of the farmers as per the list supplied by the field officers.</p>
