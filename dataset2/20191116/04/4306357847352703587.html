      <h3>Gary Lineker has taken to social media to congratulate Tammy Abraham on scoring his first goal for England in the 7-0 thrashing of Montenegro on Thursday night.</h3>
      <p>The Chelsea FC striker netted late on in the clash as he scored the seventh goal to wrap up a victory which secured England’s qualification for Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>Harry Kane scored a hat-trick to add to goals from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Marcus Rashford and a Aleksandar Sofranac own goal.</p>
      <p>Abraham played the final 33 minutes of the European qualifier and repaid Gareth Southgate for the faith he has shown in him by netting his first senior England goal.</p>
      <p>One man who knows a thing or two about scoring for England is Lineker, and the former striker took to social media to salute Abraham after his goal on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>Lineker <a href="https://twitter.com/GaryLineker/status/1195090950336524301">wrote</a> on Twitter: “Congratulations to @tammyabraham on his first @England goal. Always a truly special moment. First of many for his country, I suspect.”</p>
      <p>Abraham will be hoping to feature for Chelsea FC when the Blues return to Premier League action with a trip to Manchester City next Saturday.</p>
      <p>The west London side are currently third in the Premier League table and eight points behind leaders Liverpool FC after 12 games of the new campaign.</p>
      <p>Abraham has scored 10 goals and made two assists in 12 Premier League games so far this season.</p>
