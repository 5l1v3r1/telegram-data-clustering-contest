      <p>The CDC announced on Thursday that cigarette smoking rates in the United States have reached recorded lows with just 13.7 percent of the adult population smoking cigarettes in 2018.</p>
      <p>The percentage of smokers is just one-third from the number of smokers from 50 years ago.</p>
      <p>The CDC said that 19.7 percent of American adults used tobacco products in 2018. Cigars are used by 3.9 percent of adults; e-cigarettes by 3.2 percent of adults; smokeless tobacco by 2.4 percent of adults; and pipes, water pipes, or hookahs by 1 percent. The CDC said nearly 18.8 percent of tobacco users use two or more products.</p>
      <p>“This marked decline in cigarette smoking is the achievement of a consistent and coordinated effort by the public health community and our many partners,” said CDC Director Robert R. Redfield, M.D. “Yet, our work is far from over. The health benefits of quitting smoking are significant, and we are committed to educating Americans about the steps they can take to become tobacco-free.”</p>
      <p>While overall tobacco use has declined, e-cigarette use is on the rise, especially among young adults.</p>
      <p>More than 7 percent of young adults (ages 18-24) use e-cigarettes.</p>
      <p>According to the CDC, cigarette smoking is responsible for more than 480,000 deaths per year including more than 41,000 deaths resulting from secondhand smoke exposure.</p>
