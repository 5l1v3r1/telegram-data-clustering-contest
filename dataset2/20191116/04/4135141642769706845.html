      <h1>Second half rally falls short as Gophers lose to Utah 73-69</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T04:28:27+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 04:28</time> by <a rel="author">AP</a></address>
      <p><b>SALT LAKE CITY —</b> Timmy Allen scored 19 points and collected 10 rebounds while Both Gach added 19 points to help Utah beat <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-basketball/minnesota-golden-gophers-team">Minnesota</a> 73-69 on Friday night.</p>
      <p>Riley Battin added 13 points and eight rebounds while Rylan Jones chipped in 10 points and six assists for the Utes. Utah (3-0) led from wire-to-wire while shooting 53 percent from the floor.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-basketball/daniel-oturu-player-stats">Daniel Oturu</a> scored 21 points and pulled down 18 rebounds to lead Minnesota. <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-basketball/marcus-carr-2-player-stats">Marcus Carr</a> finished with 15 points, nine rebounds, and six assists while <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-basketball/gabe-kalscheur-player-stats">Gabe Kalscheur</a> added 13 points for the <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-basketball/minnesota-golden-gophers-team">Golden Gophers</a>.</p>
      <p>Minnesota (1-3) lost its third straight game despite committing only five turnovers.</p>
      <p>Minnesota and Utah started the game on opposite ends of the offensive spectrum.</p>
      <p>The Golden Gophers missed six straight shots and went nearly four minutes without a field goal before Oturu ended the drought with a pair of 3-pointers and a jumper over three straight possessions.</p>
      <p>The Utes, on the other hand, barely missed anything in the game’s early minutes. Utah opened the first half by scoring 16 unanswered points and raced out to a 19-3 lead at the 15:44 mark. Gach fueled the run by sinking a pair of free throws, drilling a 3-pointer, and scoring a layup over three consecutive possessions. Overall, Utah started 7-of-8 shooting from the field and scored on eight of its first nine possessions.</p>
      <p>Minnesota struggled to climb out of that early hole. The Golden Gophers trailed the Utes by double digits through much of the first half until back-to-back baskets from Kalscheur and Carr cut Utah’s lead to 39-33 going into halftime.</p>
      <p>Sloppiness on offense from Utah opened the door for Minnesota to chip away even more at the deficit. The Golden Gophers twice rallied to within a point, the second time after <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-basketball/tre-williams-player-stats">Tre Williams</a> and Kalscheur made back-to-back 3-pointers to spark a 9-0 run that cut Utah’s lead to 50-49.</p>
      <p>Minnesota never found a way to take the lead. The Utes finally pulled away when Battin and Jones each hit a pair of free throws sandwiched around a dunk from Allen to give Utah a 67-59 lead with 1:36 remaining.</p>
      <p>
        <b>BIG PICTURE</b>
      </p>
      <p>Minnesota: The Golden Gophers were a one-man team through much of the first half. Oturu scored 16 points on 6-of-8 shooting in the first 20 minutes. When Utah clamped down on Oturu in the second half, Minnesota struggled to get enough offense elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Utah: Youth and inexperience bubbled to the surface at inopportune times for the Utes. Utah committed 16 turnovers – including five over five straight possessions in the second half – to open the door for Minnesota to make it a close game.</p>
