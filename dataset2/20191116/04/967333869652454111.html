      <p>However, close to the square, demonstrators burned garbage and parts of trees. Black smoke from the fires could be seen across the area. </p>
      <p>On the road to the square, reporters noted a lot of people selling devices for protection from tear gas, water, and lemon juice, which is believed to help soothe skin irritated by tear gas.</p>

      <p>The rallies in Chile, which began in October, were caused by a spike in transportation costs. They subsequently <a href="https://sputniknews.com/latam/201911131077294064-violence-erupts-in-chile-again-amid-national-currencys-historic-fall/">led to larger protests</a> against economic and social policies and resulted in unrest.</p>
      <p>The situation has led to the cancellation of an APEC summit and COP25 climate forum, which were planned to be hosted by Santiago.</p>
