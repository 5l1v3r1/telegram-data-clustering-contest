      <h1>LeBron James has similar retirement plans to Tom Brady</h1>

      <p>LOS ANGELES — Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James on Friday said he is a long way from hanging up his high tops and likened himself to veteran New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, who is still going strong at age 42.</p>
      <p>Asked by reporters whether retirement had crossed his mind, the 34-year-old James shook his head.</p>
      <p>“I’m not at the end of my story,” James said prior to a game between his first place Lakers and the visiting Sacramento Kings at Staples Center.</p>
      <p>“So no, not the way I feel right now.</p>
      <p>“Me and Tom Brady are one and the same. We’re going to keep playing until we can’t walk no more,” he said with a smile.</p>
      <p>“As long as I still feel great and as long as I can still play at a high level … I will play this game until I physically can’t or … mentally I’m a little checked out,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Then you could start looking at that. I have no idea when that happens but I’m not there.”</p>
      <p>Brady, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/14/alex-guerrero-tom-bradys-trainer-says-quarterback-wants-to-play-at-47/">whose trainer said the QB wants to play into his late 40s</a>, responded with <a href="https://twitter.com/TomBrady">a fun tweet</a> after seeing James’ comments.</p>
      <p>“I’m playing until I can’t dunk anymore! @KingJames,” the six-time Super Bowl champ wrote.</p>
      <p>After missing time with injuries in a disappointing first season with Los Angeles, it appeared the league’s grueling schedule might finally be catching up to the three-time NBA champion, who reached the finals in eight consecutive seasons.</p>
      <p>But James has been his dominant self in the early going of this campaign, leading a retooled Lakers roster to a 9-2 record to sit atop the loaded Western Conference.</p>
