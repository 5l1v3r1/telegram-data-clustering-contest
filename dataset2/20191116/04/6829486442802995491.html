      <h1>Lizzo Is Getting Sued By The Food Delivery Driver She Tried To Put “On Blast” On Twitter</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T04:02:37+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 04:02</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Earp</a></address>
      <p>Earlier this year, Lizzo fucked up.</p>
      <p>The ‘Truth Hurts’ singer felt stung by a Postmates delivery worker who she claimed “stole” her food. In retaliation, she shared a screenshot of the Postmates order, which included the delivery driver’s face, plus her first name and last initial.</p>
      <p>The move was presumably an attempt both to shame Postmates into reprimanding the worker — Lizzo tagged the delivery service in the tweet — and to get the singer’s hundreds of thousands of fans to go after her.</p>

      <p>Basically, it was about as selfish a use of fame as it is possible to imagine — a craven attempt to mobilise the support of her fans to attack someone making many hundreds of thousands a dollar year in income less than her.</p>
      <p>The decision to share the information kicked off a massive backlash against Lizzo, so bad that the singer was eventually forced to <a href="https://junkee.com/lizzo-postmates-apology/222233">apologise and delete her tweet.</a></p>
      <p>Now, the Postmates worker has filed a suit against Lizzo, <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/lizzo-sued-by-postmates-delivery-person-she-accused-of-stealing-her-food/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_social-type=owned&amp;utm_brand=p4k&amp;mbid=social_facebook&amp;fbclid=IwAR2zob_NwRXsUf9JeopbyoXYrlhVwyOct1AUBrt5eOabsQcNX-j0HIPWrOU">as per </a><i>Pitchfork.</i></p>
      <p>According to the suit, the singer made “false statements that are defamatory and are libelous.”</p>
      <p>“Lizzo’s conduct was extreme and outrageous in that she used her celebrity to publicly defame, disparage, and threaten a private individual to roughly one million Twitter followers,” goes the rest of the suit.</p>
      <p>The singer is yet to respond.</p>
