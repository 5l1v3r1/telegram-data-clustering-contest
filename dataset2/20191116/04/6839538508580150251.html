      <p>Not sure how to ask your bank for a better home loan? Barefoot Investor Scott Pape has done the hard work for you, creating a script for you to use to get a better home loan from your bank.</p>
      <p><b>You: </b>Hello, my account number is ______. I’ve been with you for ___ years, but I’ve applied to refinance with UBank. Their rate is ____ per cent, which is a full ___ per cent cheaper than you’re charging me. Given our longstanding relationship, I’d like you to match the offer — or send me the forms I need to switch to UBank.</p>
      <p><b>Bank rep: </b>One moment, please.</p>
      <p>(You’re bluffing, of course. However, the bank’s sales team have strict targets, backed by incentives, that they have to meet — one of which is giving profitable customers discounts to stop them leaving.)</p>
      <p><b>Bank rep:</b> We can’t match the rate you have quoted. However, we understand you are a valuable customer, so we would like to offer you a 0.15 per cent discount.</p>
      <p><b>You:</b> That’s not good enough. I’ve already got conditional approval … so in order to stay I need at least a 0.5 per cent discount. Could you please speak to your supervisor? I’m happy to wait.</p>
      <p><b>Bank rep (a full six minutes later): </b>On reviewing your case, we can offer you that 0.5 per cent discount on your current rate.</p>
      <p><b>You: </b>Brilliant! Please send me an email confirming the new rate and confirming that it will be applied as of start of business tomorrow.</p>
