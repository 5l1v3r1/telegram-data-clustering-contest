      <p><b>BOSTON</b> - Massachusetts is one step closer to a hands-free driving law.</p>
      <p>On Friday, the 6-member committee appointed to work out differing House and Senate distracted driving bills, has announced that an agreement has been reached on a conference report.</p>
      <p>The new legislation will restrict the use of hand-held cellphones while driving a motor vehicle and will update an existing law regarding racial profiling by law enforcement.</p>
      <p>Representative Bill Straus and Senator Joe Boncore, co-chairs of the committee, have both signed the conference report, which is being circulated for signatures of the other Senate and House conference committee members.</p>
      <p>On Monday, the conference report is expected to be filed with the House clerk on Beacon Hill.</p>
      <p>It is still unclear when the bill will be introduced in the House.</p>
      <p>Currently, Massachusetts is the only New England state without a hands-free driving law.</p>
