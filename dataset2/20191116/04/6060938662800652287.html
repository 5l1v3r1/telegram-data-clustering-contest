      <h1>Lionel Messi goal gives Argentina 1-0 win over Brazil</h1>

      <p>RIYADH: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Lionel-Messi">Lionel Messi</a> returned from international suspension to score the winner in Argentina's 1-0 victory over Brazil in <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/saudi-arabia">Saudi Arabia</a> on Friday.</p>
      <p>The Barcelona striker, who missed four games after calling the South American <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/delhi-dynamos">Football</a> Confederation "corrupt," scored after 14 minutes to give Argentina a deserved victory in the so-called Superclasico.</p>
      <p>The result extended Brazilâ€™s winless run to five games since they lifted the Copa America in July, their worst such run since 2013.</p>
      <p>Brazil beat Argentina 2-0 the last time these teams met in the Copa America semi-finals and they should have taken a ninth minute lead but Gabriel Jesus fired a penalty kick wide after he had been brought down in the box.</p>
      <p>Argentina were also awarded a penalty five minutes later and although Brazilian keeper Alisson saved Messi's initial effort, the Barcelona striker followed up to put Argentina 1-0 ahead.</p>
      <p>Messi missed two chances to double Argentina's lead before halftime, with defender Eder Militao and Alisson blocking the opportunities.</p>
      <p>Brazil, who were without Paris St Germain striker Neymar, had two-thirds of the possession but rarely threatened the Argentine goal in a game that featured 41 fouls and six yellow cards.</p>
      <p>Argentina, meanwhile, looked more sprightly, even without Sergio Aguero and Paulo Dybala, both of whom were unused substitutes.</p>
      <p>Argentina have now won three of the five games they have played since their semi-final exit at the Copa America.</p>
