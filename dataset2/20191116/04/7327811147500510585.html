      <p>CANARSIE, Brooklyn (WABC) -- It is an amazing story of police work, combined with gut instinct and luck, possibly saving the lives of a mother and her infant.</p>
      <p>A grandmother in Canarsie called the police, worried about her 27-year-old daughter, who was sending texts indicating she wanted to harm herself and her 6-month-old baby.</p>
      <p>The young mother then told officer Michelle Shack and her partner over the phone that she was heading up to the Poconos and planned to buy a gun.</p>
      <p>The officers looked up gun shops along the route and started calling them with a description of the woman.</p>
      <p>The baby is now safe and in the care of a relative. Her mother is being treated.</p>
