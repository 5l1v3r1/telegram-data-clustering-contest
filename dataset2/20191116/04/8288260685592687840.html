      <h3>Wolves loan watch</h3>
      <p>Wolverhampton Wanderers have a catalogue of players out on loan.</p>
      <p>Beneath <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/nuno-espirito-santo">Nuno Espirito Santo's</a> first team squad is a dozen or so players who are either surplus to requirements or in need of senior minutes the Portuguese is unable to offer them at Molineux.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> have used the loan market successfully in recent seasons and they are hoping the host of players they’ve lent to other clubs this term reap the benefits.</p>
      <p>Here, we take a look at the fortunes of all the Wolves players currently out on loan:</p>
      <h3>Liverpool coach on Neves</h3>
      <p>One of Ruben Neves' former youth coaches at Porto has offered a fascinating insight into the Wolverhampton Wanderers midfielder's mentality.</p>
      <p>Before joining <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> for £15.8million two years ago, Neves captained boyhood club Porto at just 18 and starred in the Champions League.</p>
      <p>It's a stage <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/ruben-neves">Neves</a> will undoubtedly reach again with his Premier League performances earning him plenty of admirers.</p>

      <p>And Liverpool coach Vitor Matos, who played a part in Neves' development in Porto's youth system, has revealed his pride at the midfielder's rise.</p>
      <p>“All who passed through there (Porto) made a great effort and were brilliant,” Matos told O Jogo <a href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/liverpool-coach-singles-wolves-star-fantastic-example-hails-top-mentality/">(via Sport Witness).</a> “But Rúben Neves is a fantastic example. I saw him grow from 13-years-old to be captain of the first team.</p>
      <p>“In terms of mentality, what each individual’s belief is, he was top. If training was at 10am, he was in the field at 9am to train long passes, shots, free-kicks. This already existed within him.”</p>
      <p>Liverpool have repeatedly been linked with moves for Neves with Jurgen Klopp's number two Pep Ljinders - also formerly of Porto - known to be a huge fan of the Wolves man.</p>

      <h3>Fans' hopes for Molineux</h3>
      <p>Redeveloping Molineux is a hot topic at Wolverhampton Wanderers right now.</p>
      <p>Chairman <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/jeff-shi">Jeff Shi</a> has made no secret of Fosun’s desire to increase Molineux’s capacity to at least 50,000 and the club are in constant dialogue with Wolverhampton Council over potential avenues of expansion.</p>
      <p>Just last month at the latest Fans’ Parliament meeting <a href="https://www.wolves.co.uk/news/club/20191023-fans-parliament-minutes-october-2019/">marketing chief Russell Jones revealed the chances of work beginning in May 2020 are ‘small’.</a> But he also divulged discussions surrounding one of Molineux’s stands.</p>
      <p>“I and two colleagues are working on the Steve Bull Stand almost daily with the council,” said Jones.</p>

      <p>It isn’t just the Steve Bull Stand which will need work if Molineux is to reach Shi’s target, with the South Bank also earmarked for improvements.</p>
      <p>There are more changes fans want to see made before Molineux is the 21st century Golden Palace everyone craves.</p>
      <p>We asked <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> supporters what they would change about Molineux and while many agree its capacity is the most pressing concern with thousands on the season ticket waiting list, there were plenty of other responses.</p>

      <h3>Transfer rumour 'not true'</h3>
      <p>Wolverhampton Wanderers have categorically denied any interest in Swedish midfielder Dejan Kulusevski.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old, who plays his club football for Serie A side Atalanta on loan from Parma, has been linked with a host of Premier League clubs including Manchester City and Arsenal.</p>
      <p>And, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/dejan-kulusevski-wolves-transfer-news-17197857">according to reports</a> earlier this month, Wolves had joined the race for Kulusevski with boss <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/nuno-espirito-santo">Nuno Espirito Santo</a> ready to sanction a £13million offer.</p>

      <p>Head of recruitment John Marshall has refuted those claims, however, and insists the Swede isn’t someone who is currently on Wolves’ radar.</p>
      <p>“I also read this indiscretion, but it is not true,” <a href="https://www.tuttomercatoweb.com/serie-a/tmw-wyscout-marshall-wolves-cutrone-e-gia-un-idolo-no-a-kessie-1314249?fbclid=IwAR2efKnlPJDEqp07R5hh9hMOJnr53E4RkwVEPnmnnGxYzMDfSqJTv72Iz50">Marshall told TMW at a scouting convention in Amsterdam.</a> “He is not a player that interests us."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> dipped into Serie A during the summer to sign Patrick Cutrone, Bruno Jordao and Pedro Neto, with the former signed from AC Milan for a fee that will reach £20million.</p>
      <p>On Cutrone, Marshall said: "He has everything to become more and more a protagonist of our reality. And besides he is a player much loved by the fans, in the field he always gives everything. We are very satisfied with him.”</p>
