      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T17:24:59+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 17:24</time> by <a rel="author">Deroy Murdock</a></address>
      <p>"Impeachment!" premiered Wednesday morning on Capitol Hill. This production by Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., was no boffo hit.</p>
      <p>The show’s co-stars failed to shine.

      <p>Citing Trump’s July 25 phone conversation with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/ukraine">Ukrainian</a> president Volodomyr Zelensky, Rep. John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, asked the two witnesses, “Where is the impeachable offense in that call?”</p>
      <p>Taylor and Kent <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry">blinked</a> silently at Ratcliffe.</p>

      <p>The testimony reflected hearsay and second- and third-hand information. In other words, rumors and gossip.</p>
      <p>As Taylor said: “What I can do here for you today is tell you what I heard from people.”</p>
