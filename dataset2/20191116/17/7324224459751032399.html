      <p>Robert Thompson-Brown was in the action early on for Rangers and saw his free-kick loop over the bar before crossing a second set-piece for Paul Bignot to head over.</p>
      <p>However, the visitors equally looked dangerous and Lee Mason played Jason Gilchrist through on goal, but he fired his effort over the bar.</p>
      <p>Mason was also part of the 30th minute opener as he flicked the ball on for Craig Baxter whose bundled effort trickled over the line.</p>
      <p>Shields kept probing for a second goal which came moments before the break when Nathan Loweâ€™s cross was fired home by Gilchrist to double their lead.</p>
      <p>After the break a fine strike on the hour by Jack Sherratt gave Rangers a glimmer of hope, but despite their efforts Rangers were beaten.</p>
