      <p>Barrow moved top of the Vanarama National League after easing to a 3-0 victory at Notts County.</p>
      <p>Early goals from Dior Angus and John Rooney were capped off by substitute Jack Hindle’s late strike as the hosts suffered a second home league defeat this season.</p>
      <p>Angus took the initiative after just 10 minutes, converting Josh Kay’s cross for his fifth goal in the last six matches.</p>
      <p>The forward then helped double Barrow’s lead three minutes later when he rounded keeper Sam Slocombe and crossed for Rooney to score.</p>
      <p>Wes Thomas went close for the home side after the break before Scott Quigley thought he had scored a third, only to be denied by the linesman’s flag for offside.</p>
      <p>But Hindle sealed the victory with three minutes left with a superb finish from Brad Barry’s cross.</p>
