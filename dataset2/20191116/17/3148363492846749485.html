      <h1>Nolte: 'Charlie's Angels' Is Fifth Woketard Franchise to Die at Box Office</h1>
      <h2>The 2019 reboot/sequel of Charlie’s Angels just opened to a catastrophic <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/charlies-angels-bombs-at-box-office-reasons-why-1202787938/">$8 million</a>, making it the fifth man-hating, woketard franchise to get wiped out at the box office.</h2>

      <p><i>Angels</i>, which was written and directed by Elizabeth Banks, is not only under-performing expectations by about 50 percent, it got run over by <i>Ford v Ferrari</i>, a movie about real men who throw punches and burn fossil fuels.</p>
      <p>On top of being number one at the box office with a $30 million opening, <i>Ford v Ferrari</i> over-performed by about 50 percent.</p>
      <p>Having <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/11/15/charlies-angels-2019-review-man-hating-woketards-kill-another-franchise/">seen</a> and <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/11/15/ford-v-ferrari-review-exhilarating-touching-only-in-america-story/">reviewed</a> both, I can tell you that none of this has to do with gender.</p>
      <p><i>Angels</i> is a failure because it features unappealing actresses who are more interested in lecturing us than showing us a good time. The film’s trailers promised a pretentious feminist lecture full of man-hating… and the sexless movie delivered.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, <i>Ford v Ferrari</i> looked like a great time at the movies, like an unpretentious underdog story with appealing characters you actually want to spend time with… and the movie delivered (and then some).</p>
      <p><i>Charlie’s Angels</i> is a poorly shot, poorly written, joyless death march of feminist talking points, poorly choreographed action scenes, starring three girls who have no charisma and even less chemistry together.</p>

      <p><i>Charlie’s Angels </i>wants you to feel bad about yourself, to feel guilty about being a man, for not being virtuous enough, and to divide us by lying to women about an oppressive patriarchy that doesn’t exist. GRRRRL POWER is not a theme, it’s a slogan, and <i>Angels</i> is a movie that confuses strident posturing with having something to say.</p>
      <p><i>Ford v Ferrari</i> is beautifully shot, rousing, inspiring, moving, funny, 100% American, and brilliantly acted. Using theme and appealing characters, it has much to say, not just about how conformity and corporatism crush the individual spirit, but about our shared human condition; that thing within all of us — men and women alike — to strive, to overcome, to be your own man at all costs — and yes, there is a cost… but yes, that cost is worth it.</p>
      <p>But as I mentioned earlier, this has nothing to do with gender, and I can prove it… Here are two numbers that are not adjusted for nearly two decades of inflation: $40 million and $37.6 million.</p>
      <p>All the way back in 2000, a movie based on the television show <i>Charlie’s Angels</i> and called <i>Charlie’s Angels </i>opened to $40 million. It would eventually gross $139 million domestic and $264 million worldwide (back when the international market was nowhere near as open as it is today).</p>
      <p>All the way back in 2003, the sequel, <i>Charlie’s Angels: Full Throttle</i>, opened to $37.6 million. It would eventually gross $101 million domestic and $260 million worldwide.</p>
      <p>But here’s the difference…</p>
      <p>The 2000 version of <i>Charlie’s Angels</i> somehow managed to drive home its empowerment and sisterhood message without dumpster-diving into misandry. And unlike this current trio of generic, androgynous, mall-girl angels, the 2000 version featured three sexy women: Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz, and Lucy Liu, who didn’t apologize for being sexy, who used that power to convince us guys the movie was worth our time, and they delivered.</p>
      <p>The goodwill from <i>Charlie’s Angels</i> (2000) was such that three years later the studio dropped $125 million into the sequel, and even though <i>Full Throttle</i> is pretty awful, it’s still more fun than this hideous 2019 reboot, which is why it was able to crawl over $100 million domestic, when that number really meant something.</p>
      <p>And so, <i>Charlie’s Angels</i> (2019) is the fifth franchise the man-hating woketards have destroyed, the fifth golden goose strangled by these joyless and the artless harpies.</p>
      <p><i>Charlie’s Angels</i> (2019) excluded and demeaned men, told us we were not invited, so neither we nor the women who love us showed up, and now it’s the flop it deserves to be. <i>Terminator: Dark Fate </i>did the same: stridently pushed us out of the way because the future is female donchaknow, as did <i>Ghostbusters</i>, as did <i>Men in Black</i>.</p>
      <p>And then there’s <i>Star Wars</i>…</p>
      <p>Yeah, <i>Star Wars</i> is going to finish out its trilogy next month, and it will make a fortune, but afterwards that film franchise is <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/10/29/top-talent-abandons-star-wars-film-franchise/">doornail dead</a> — as of right now there is nothing filming, nothing scheduled, not even a completed screenplay.</p>
      <p>Why?</p>
      <p>The man-hating of <i>Last Jedi</i> turned everyone off. <i>Last Jedi</i> under-performed bigtime, <i>Solo</i> tanked (Good God, a <i>Star Wars</i> movie tanked!), and now the greatest and most iconic movie franchise in history is… a TV show.</p>
      <p>We don’t hate you Hollywood.</p>
      <p>We’re just hating you back.</p>
      <p>You started it.</p>
      <p>And good luck with that <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/11/11/nolte-woke-james-bond-marries-bossy-feminist-drives-electric-car/">new James Bond</a> movie!</p>
