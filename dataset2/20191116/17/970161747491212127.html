      <p>Psychic Chris Riley has predicted who he thinks will win <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>…Get Me Out Of Here ahead of the show – which starts on Sunday night.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn Jenner</a>, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/nadine-coyle/">Nadine Coyle</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/roman-kemp/">Roman Kemp</a> are just some of the famous faces heading to Australia to camp out for the ITV show.</p>
      <p>But Chris believes that former X Factor winner Myles Stephenson has what it takes to go all the way.</p>
      <p>‘I feel very drawn to Myles from Rak-Su, when looking at the entire 2019 ensemble,’ he told <b>Metro.co.uk</b>.</p>
      <p>‘I can see that he’s determined and won’t give up easily, he’ll have great enthusiasm whilst remaining down to earth and respectful.</p>
      <p>‘He will also bring some much-needed humour to the camp, giving him a great chance of becoming this year’s King of the Jungle.’</p>

      <p>Ahead of the show, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/im-a-celebritys-scarlett-moffat-shares-predictions-as-shes-replaced-by-emily-atack-on-extra-camp-11164867/">former Queen of the Jungle Scarlett Moffatt also shared her top tips</a> for who will be the most successful participants.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>And she’s tipped Capital FM DJ Roman, ex-footballer <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ian-wright/">Ian Wright</a> and EastEnders actress Jacqueline Jossa to go all the way.</p>
      <p>The potential line-up for the finalists of the show may surprise some fans, as Scarlett hasn’t included Girls Aloud’s Nadine, Good Morning Britain anchor Kate Garraway or the show’s biggest coup this year, reality TV icon Caitlyn.</p>
      <p>More than just a bookie, however, Scarlett also made sure to include some pointers for this year’s contestants.</p>
      <p>Ahead of its launch this Sunday, everyone is preparing themselves for the literal trials and tribulations the celebrities will be put through during their tenure in the Australian jungle.</p>
      <p>And we could be in for actual landmark television, as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/im-a-celebritys-myles-stephenson-to-grill-caitlin-jenner-over-oj-simpson-murder-trial-11162233/">Rak-Su singer Myles Stephenson is apparently ready to grill Jenner over the OJ Simpson murder trial</a>.</p>
      <p>At the time of the trial, the athlete was of course married to Kris Jenner, whose ex-husband Robert Kardashian was a lawyer on OJ’s defence team.</p>
