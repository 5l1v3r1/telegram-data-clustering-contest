      <p>On Friday’s “PBS NewsHour,” <i>New York Times </i>columnist David Brooks stated that while he thinks there is a good case against President Trump, he doesn’t think minds are being changed on impeachment.</p>
      <p>Brooks said, “I do disagree that this is somehow changing minds. I’ve seen no polling evidence that it’s changing minds. I don’t think people are watching, particularly out in the country. Since this whole impeachment thing has started, I’ve probably been in 20 states. I can’t think of too many places where people have talked to me about this. … I do think the case is a very strong one. I do think what he’s done was appalling. But Americans who like him like him. And the economy is the economy.”</p>
