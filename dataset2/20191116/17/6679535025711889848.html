She’s the protagonist of the work, which also touches upon the commissions that probed the peasant riots and features figures like Kunji Mayan, a key personality from Thalassery who was exiled for speaking up against the British during the sepoy mutiny.</p>
      <p>The novel is replete with references to the organic life of Malabar of those times, particularly its farming practices, dialects and geography. Historical figures like Karl Marx and Annie Besant find mention in Annie’s recollections. The book, brought out by DC Books, is priced at ₹240.</p>
