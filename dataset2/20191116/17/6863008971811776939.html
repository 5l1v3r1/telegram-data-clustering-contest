      <p>He was placed in the city's temporary detention center, the SBU spokeswoman, Olena Gitlianska, reports, adding that Hrytsenko is suspected of being part of a criminal organization, as well as embezzlement and money laundering.</p>
      <p>SBU officials say the charges involve complicity in laundering illicit assets by ousted ex-president Viktor <a href="https://www.unian.info/society/10632360-corrupt-judges-interfered-to-lift-arrest-off-yanukovych-property-investigators-say.html">Yanukovych</a>'s entourage.</p>
      <p>The case targets the withdrawal from under arrest the assets of one of Ukrainian media holdings.</p>
      <p>Earlier today, Hrytsenko's family raised the alarm, claiming a group of men wearing balaklavas "kidnapped" him as he was walking his child.</p>
      <p>Hrytsenko had been appointed Ukreximbank head in August 2014.</p>
