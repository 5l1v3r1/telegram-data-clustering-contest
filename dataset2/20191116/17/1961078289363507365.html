      <h1>Prison’s Tips for Inmates in Solitary: ‘Plant a Tree’ or ‘Go on a Picnic’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T17:36:32+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 17:36</time> by <a rel="author">Mike Baker</a></address>
      <p>SEATTLE — As Joey Pedersen made his way to solitary confinement last month, Washington State prison officers handed him a roll of toilet paper, a bar of soap and a pack of documents including a flier titled “101 Ways to Relieve Stress.”</p>
      <p>He reviewed the suggestions in his new cell, where he would spend 23 hours a day alone. “Plant a tree.” “Go on a picnic.” “Put air freshener in your car.” “Avoid negative people.”</p>
      <p>“Relax,” the document concluded, “you have the rest of your life.”</p>
      <p>The options did not give Mr. Pedersen, who is serving life sentences for murders, much peace, but they did make him chuckle. To him, the document was just the latest sign that prison officials were out of touch with mental health issues among inmates, while using solitary confinement to address even minor slights.</p>
      <p>After the document was brought to their attention, leaders of the state Department of Corrections said in interviews this week that they would no longer use it, calling it a well-intentioned effort that “missed the mark.”</p>
      <p>“We want to find something that is more appropriate,” said Dr. Karie Rainer, the department’s director of mental health.</p>
      <p>The document was apparently put in use years ago at the <a href="https://www.doc.wa.gov/corrections/incarceration/prisons/wsp.htm">Washington State Penitentiary</a> as local prison workers sought a way to help inmates cope with stress, said Dr. Rainer. For now, the penitentiary has decided to instead include softcover library books as part of the materials distributed to inmates as they enter solitary confinement. Mr. Pedersen said they had also given him a couple of crossword puzzles.</p>
      <p>Researchers over the years <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/04/health/solitary-confinement-mental-illness.html?module=inline">have documented links</a> between solitary confinement and adverse psychological effects. Mr. Pedersen said that the stress-reduction document, aside from its absurdity, had made him think about others who were unstable as they entered solitary confinement and needed support. Existing mental health services, he said, were insufficient.</p>
      <p>“It’s like putting a Band-Aid on a gunshot wound,” said Mr. Pedersen.</p>
      <p>Dr. Rainer said the institution was keenly aware of mental health issues, including those around inmates who are segregated from the rest of the population. She said mental health professionals were available on an as-needed basis but also did rounds once a week to look for signs of inmates who needed help.</p>
      <p>The use of the stress-reduction document came to light as the state has come under scrutiny for what prisoners’ advocates say is an overuse of solitary confinement. After some inmates — not including Mr. Pedersen — organized a protest against conditions at one prison facility last month, the Corrections Department shipped a group of them across the state and placed them in solitary confinement. Now five of them <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/crime/inmates-sue-washington-corrections-officials-after-being-put-in-solitary-confinement-over-food-strike/">have filed a lawsuit</a> challenging whether the state had appropriate grounds to take such an action.</p>
      <p>Still, the Corrections Department has <a href="https://www.doc.wa.gov/news/2019/05162019p.htm">made substantial changes</a> recently to who gets placed in solitary confinement. It has eliminated the practice for those who need protection from self-harm, and started programs to help confined inmates transition into the general prison population.</p>
