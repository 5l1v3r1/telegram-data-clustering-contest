      <p>The Venezuelan opposition will hold nationwide protests on Saturday in the hope of reviving a stalled movement to oust President Nicolas Maduro, who has held on to power despite an economic crisis and aggressive US sanctions.</p>
      <p>Opposition leader Juan Guaido kick-started a groundswell protest movement in January by invoking the constitution to assume an interim presidency after declaring Maduro's 2018 re-election a fraud.</p>
      <p>But the energy has waned and frustration is mounting as Maduro remains in control and the economic meltdown continues to push Venezuelan migrants across the country's borders.</p>
      <p>"The dictatorship has underestimated the Venezuelan people. They have not been able to make us grow accustomed to living in misery," Guaido tweeted on Friday night.</p>
      <p>Masked men on Friday forced their way into the offices of opposition party Popular Will, to which Guaido belongs. Opposition leaders called the incident an intimidation effort in the run-up to the demonstrations.</p>
      <p>The opposition has been inspired by the resignation of Bolivian President Evo Morales, a Maduro ally who was accused of manipulating the results of an election in October but later resigned after the violent street protest.</p>
      <p>But the change in Venezuela continues to hinge on a shift in the allegiance of the armed forces, which remain loyal to Maduro and the ruling Socialist Party. That contrasts with Bolivia's military leaders, who urged Morales to step down.</p>
      <p>Demonstrators in cities around the country plan to stage rallies during the morning and are expected to hold marches in the afternoon.</p>
      <p>The Caracas metro, the capital's principal form of public transport, said it was closing a group of stations in the area of the protests for maintenance. Critics said it was an attempt to weaken the demonstrations.</p>
      <p>The Socialist party has called a separate rally in Caracas in support of Bolivia's Morales.</p>
      <p>Venezuela has for years suffered under hyperinflation and a collapsing economy, spurring an exodus of more than 4 million seeking better access to food and medicine.</p>
      <p>More than 50 countries have recognized Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate president and the United States has implemented a sanctions program that has crippled Venezuela's oil exports.</p>
      <p>Maduro dismisses Guaido as a puppet of the United States, and blames the economic problems on U.S. sanctions.</p>
