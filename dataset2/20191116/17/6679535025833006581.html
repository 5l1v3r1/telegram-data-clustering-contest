      <p>Mangaluru Bishop Most Rev Peter Paul Saldanha on Friday felicitated Christian Councillors elected to Mangaluru City Corporation and prominent Christian personalities appointed to important government posts during the Diocesan Pastoral Parishad meeting at Bishop House.</p>
      <p>Those felicitated include Ronald Anil Fernandes, appointed as a member of the Karnataka Public Service Commission; Joylus D. Souza, the newly appointed chairman of Christian Development Board of Karnataka and MCC Councillors Lancelot Pinto, Naveen D. Souza, A.C. Vinayaraj and Jacintha Alfred.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Fernandes said Christians, particularly students from Mangaluru, rarely appear for competitive and civil services examinations.</p>
      <p>They would not make a second attempt if they fail in the first attempt whereas multiple attempts are available in competitive examinations. While political power is shorter, the power of bureaucracy is long lasting and thus one could serve society for a longer period, Mr. Fernandes said.</p>
      <p>M.P. Noronha Secretary of DPP, Vicar General, Chancellor, Superior Generals, Provincial Superiors, Members of DPP and others were present.</p>
