      <p>Bellator fan favorite Michael ‘Venom’ Page — otherwise known as MVP — has accepted a short notice replacement fight against Giovanni Melillo after it was revealed that Derek Anderson had pulled out of Bellator London just one week out from the event. <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/michael-venom-page-to-take-on-giovanni-melillo-in-bellator-london-main-event-after-derek-anderson-a4287541.html">Standard Sport</a> confirmed the news on Friday.</p>

      <p>Page (15-1 MMA) will look to keep the momentum going following his highlight reel flying knee knockout of Richard Kiely at Bellator 227. The London Shootfighter is gunning for a rematch with newly-crowned Bellator welterweight champion Douglas Lima, who KO’d Page earlier this year in the Bellator 221 co-main event at Allstate Arena in Rosemont, Illinois.</p>
      <p>Speaking of his new matchup against Melillo (13-4 MMA), who will be making his Bellator debut against Page, MVP said he is in the best shape of his career and will be looking to put on a show for the fans.</p>
      <p>“This is the best I have ever felt in training, this is the fittest I have ever been,” Page told Standard Sport. “I’ve been smashing it on the machines, hitting all my personal bests. I’m sparring exceptionally well, I feel too good to really care who is across the cage from me. I just feel sorry for whoever it is.”</p>
      <p>Bellator London II takes place next Saturday, Nov. 23 at the SSE Arena in Page’s hometown of London, England.</p>
