        <b>Miralem Pjanic will sit out of Bosnia-Herzegovina’s clash with Liechtenstein on Monday after suffering an injury against Italy.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Juventus midfielder Miralem Pjanic suffered a thigh injury against Italy on Friday, Bosnia-Herzegovina have confirmed.</p>
      <p>Pjanic has been in impressive form for Juve in Serie A this season but pulled up in a 1-1 draw against Lecce in October, returning in the Turin derby at the start of this month.</p>
      <p>He looks to have suffered another setback after being substituted with 13 minutes remaining of a 3-0 home Euro 2020 qualifying defeat to Italy.</p>
      <p>Bosnia confirmed on Saturday the 29-year-old would miss their trip to Liechtenstein on Monday, leaving Juve with a fitness concern ahead of a tough test against Atalanta next weekend.</p>
      <p>“National team players Miralem Pjanic and Luka Menalo will miss the team’s next match against Liechtenstein due to injuries,” Bosnia’s statement read.</p>
      <p>“Pjanic has an adductor injury, while Menalo has an ankle injury.”</p>
