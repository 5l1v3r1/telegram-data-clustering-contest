      <h1>Garry runs rings around Benetton as Leinster triumph</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T17:58:51+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 17:58</time> by <a rel="author">By Online Editors</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/the-latest-irish-rugby-world-cup-hangover-threatening-the-irish-provinces/">Returning centre Garry Ringrose</a> helped himself to a hat-trick in Leinster’s five-try 33-19 Heineken Champions Cup win over <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/benetton">Benetton</a> at the RDS.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/ireland">Ireland</a> star touched down twice inside the first 14 minutes, sandwiching a <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/italy/players/dean-budd/">Dean Budd</a> effort, and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/leinster/players/ronan-kelleher/">Ronan Kelleher</a> marked his European debut with a try on the half-hour mark as last season’s runners-up opened up a 19-7 interval lead.</p>
      <p>A crowd of 15,080 watched <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/leinster">Leinster</a> captain Jonathan Sexton convert his own bonus-point try but <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/benetton/players/hame-faiva/">Hame Faiva</a> hit back to keep the pressure on. Man-of-the-match Ringrose cut inside a tired 68th-minute tackle to notch his first career hat-trick before <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/benetton/players/luca-sperandio/">Luca Sperandio</a> claimed a late consolation score.</p>
      <p>The Leinster pack pressed from an early lineout maul before quick hands released Ringrose – one of the Irish province’s latest returning <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/rugby-world-cup">Rugby World Cup</a> players – to crash over near the left corner for a fourth-minute unconverted try.</p>
      <p>The ambitious Italians edged 7-5 ahead on the back on their own lineout platform. Lock Budd did really well to twist out of an <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/ireland/players/andrew-porter/">Andrew Porter</a> tackle and score under a pile of bodies. <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/benetton/players/ian-keatley/">Ian Keatley</a> converted to the left of the posts.</p>

      <p>After <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/ireland/players/rhys-ruddock/">Rhys Ruddock</a> had gone close from a Sexton Garryowen, a big <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/leinster/players/devin-toner/">Devin Toner</a> carry teed up Ringrose to step inside a defender and finish strongly from close range. Sexton split the posts with the conversion. Benetton turned down a second kickable penalty but Toner stole the subsequent lineout. Caolan Doris’ first European start was cut short by a head injury before a <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/ireland/players/luke-mcgrath/">Luke McGrath</a> break had Leinster back on the prowl.</p>
      <p>Profiting from Nicola Quaglio’s yellow card for a high tackle on Kelleher, the hosts’ in-form hooker picked from a ruck, feigned a pass to Josh Van Der Flier and powered over for his seventh try of the season. Sexton’s conversion made it a 12-point advantage.</p>

      <p>Keatley dropped a long-range penalty shortly before half-time, and his opposite number Sexton swooped for an early second-half score, breaking free from a tackle on halfway and receiving a return pass from Van Der Flier to run in behind the posts.</p>
      <p>The Treviso outfit’s robust maul was the launchpad for hooker Faiva to evade Ruddock and close the gap back to a dozen points. <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/benetton/players/angelo-esposito/">Angelo Esposito</a> increased his threat on the wing, although his costly knock-on ruined some promising build-up play from his pack.</p>
      <p>Benetton were left to rue those individual errors as Leinster, storming forward following some dogged defensive sets, had another tidy finish from Ringrose off a <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/leinster/players/ross-byrne/">Ross Byrne</a> pass. Nonetheless, the visitors had the final say when <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/italy/players/jayden-hayward/">Jayden Hayward</a> put winger Sperandio over in the corner.</p>
