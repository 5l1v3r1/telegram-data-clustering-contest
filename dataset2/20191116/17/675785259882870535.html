      <h1>Anger as schoolchildren do work experience - without ever leaving their desks</h1>
      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: New project in secondary schools has been attacked by critics who believe it is no replacement for getting your hands dirty in the real world workplace</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T17:43:42+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 17:43</time> by <a rel="author">Alan Selby, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>Schoolchildren are being sent on work experience – without even leaving their desks.</p>
      <p>Pupils are using virtual reality ­headsets to find out what life is like in different workplaces, from a bed ­manufacturer to a construction firm.</p>
      <p>But the project, in a borough council’s secondary schools, has been blasted as “educational cocaine that feeds young people’s addiction to the digital world”.</p>
      <p>And critics say it’s no replacement for getting your hands dirty in the real world workplace.</p>

      <p>Teenagers in schools under Pendle Council in Lancashire are using the interactive headsets to see what life is like inside a local Silentnight bed factory.</p>
      <p>The gizmo also lets them see how parts are made at bicycle firm Hope in ­Barnoldswick.</p>
      <p>And they don’t even need to put a hard hat on to tour machines at Barnfield builders in Nelson.</p>
      <p>Pupils are also shown around restaurant kitchens, with chefs demonstrating how to cook. Another work experience “visit” features a tour of a creative design workshop.</p>

      <p>Pendle Council leader Mohammed Iqbal hailed the scheme as “fantastic”. He added: “We have the highest concentration of employment in advanced manufacturing in the UK.</p>
      <p>"We want our younger generations who go to university to come back to Pendle to work.”</p>
      <p>The council claimed the project is not a replacement for traditional work ­experience. Chris McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said: “Children do need to experience the world of work – but this is best done in the real world, rather than via a computerised virtual world.</p>
      <p>“So-called virtual reality technology is educational cocaine that feeds young people’s addiction to the digital world in which many of them spend their lives.</p>
      <p>“We rightly worry about climate change, but we should be equally concerned about what an eminent brain scientist, Baroness Greenfield, has described as ‘mind change’.</p>
      <p>“Pupils desperately need to get away from the virtual workplace and into the real world workplace.”</p>
      <p>Earlier this year we revealed posties have been using headsets to learn how to avoid being attacked by dogs.</p>
      <p>The gadgets provide a 360-degree street-view scene and advice on how to deal with aggressive pets.</p>
