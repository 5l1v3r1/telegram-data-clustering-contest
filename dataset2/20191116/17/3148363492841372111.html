      <p>Kanye West is expected to attend Lakewood’s 11 a.m. service on Sunday and hold his Sunday Service performance at the church at 7 p.m., local media <a href="https://abc13.com/entertainment/kanye-wests-first-visit-in-houston-this-weekend-jail/5700012/">reports</a>.</p>
      <p>The Grammy-winner and staunch supporter of President Donald Trump brought his Sunday Service to Bethany Church in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, earlier this month, where 1,000 attendees <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/11/04/kanye-west-sunday-service-saw-1000-people-commit-their-lives-to-christ/">dedicated</a> their lives to Jesus Christ, according to Crossroads Church Pastor Curvine Brewington, who detailed what he witnessed in an Instagram post.</p>

      <p>West’s commitment to Christianity prompted the American Bible Society (ABS) to hand out 1,000 free Bibles to those interested in Christianity, <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/11/02/kanye-west-gospel-album-inspires-group-to-give-away-1000-bibles-to-his-fans/">launching</a> an initiative called “Bibles for Kanye Fans.”</p>
