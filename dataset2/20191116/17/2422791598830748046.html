      <p>MONTREAL - Two police officers from Laval, Que., were sent to hospital after losing control of the patrol car they were driving while trying to catch a suspect.</p>
      <p>They were responding to a domestic violence call around 5 a.m. today when the officers' vehicle crashed into four parked cars in a residential area of Montreal's northern suburb.</p>
      <p>Laval police say the officers spotted the suspect driving a vehicle and made an ill-fated U-turn to try and catch him.</p>
      <p>One officer sustained arm injuries and while the other suffered lacerations.</p>
      <p>The suspect, who was known to police, was not apprehended.</p>
      <p>Laval police spokeswoman Evelyne Boudreau says the cause of the crash was likely due to icy road conditions.</p>
