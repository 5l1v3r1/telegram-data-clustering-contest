      <h2>Police make appeal for witnesses as four men are arrested outside force area</h2>

      <p>Four men have been arrested on suspicion of shoplifting more than £15,000 worth of the latest iPhones.</p>
      <p>Investigators say four men raced into the Apple store, located on the first floor of <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/drake-circus">Drake Circus </a>shopping mall in <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/">Plymouth</a>, at 11.24am this morning.</p>
      <p>They snagged around 15 brand new iPhones which were on display before running from the store. It is believed the men then ran down Old Town Street towards the Barcode complex. They were then believed to have gotten into a silver BMW waiting for them in How Street before racing off.</p>
      <p>Officers from Avon and Somerset Police later stopped a silver BMW - registered to a property in Essex - in their force area and arrested four men.</p>

      <p>Plymouth police say they are very keen to hear from anyone who saw any part of the incident, from the theft in the Apple store, the men running through the mall or Old Town Street or them getting into a car in How Street.</p>
      <p>Investigators have already benefited from dashcam footage provided to them by a local taxi driver but would be grateful if anyone else who spotted or filmed the suspects would come forward.</p>
      <p>Plymouth detectives say they understand Avon and Somerset Police are currently investigating another similar incident at a phone store in a mall at the Cribbs Causeway area of Bristol which also took place on Saturday morning.</p>
