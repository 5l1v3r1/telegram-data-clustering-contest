        <i>Bakery chain develops additional vegan versions of its products after success of meatless sausage roll</i>
      </p>
      <p>The chief executive of bakery chain <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/greggs">Greggs</a> – which sells thousands of meat pasties every week – is trying veganism after seeing a documentary about the health benefits.</p>
      <p>“If you’d asked me three weeks ago which roll I preferred I would have said the original sausage roll, but I’m now attempting to live on a vegan diet,” said Roger Whiteside.</p>
      <p>Whiteside, 61, stopped eating meat and dairy three weeks ago, and told of how Greggs – which has bakeries and cafes across the UK – was working to develop vegan versions of some of its other products after the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/02/greggs-launches-vegan-sausage-roll">success of its</a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/02/greggs-launches-vegan-sausage-roll"> meatless sausage roll</a>.</p>
      <p>“I was encouraged to watch a film on Netflix called The Game Changers. I thought, ‘this is interesting’,” he said.</p>
      <p>The Game Changers charts the growing popularity of plant-based diets among current and former elite athletes such as Lewis Hamilton, Jackie Chan and Arnold Schwarzenegger due to the health benefits and concerns over deforestation.</p>
      <p>“Obviously there are arguments based around animal welfare and the environment, but this was all about the health benefits and I thought I should give it a go,” said Whiteside.</p>
      <p>Speaking after receiving this year’s North East Business Executive of the Year award on Friday, he said: “Avoiding meat is easy. The problem is avoiding dairy, avoiding milk and cheese is almost impossible. It would be OK if I had time to cook, but I don’t, so I have to have things that are quick and easy.”</p>
      <p>“We’ve got the award-winning vegan wrap which I have quite frequently and the vegan sausage roll which I’ll have about once a week, and now we have the sweet choice with the vegan sweet mince pie,” he said.</p>
      <p>More than half a million adults in the UK are believed to be vegan, and last year more vegan products were launched than in any other country after demand for meat-free food grew by almost 1,000%.</p>
      <p>Plant-focused diets have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/16/new-plant-focused-diet-would-transform-planets-future-say-scientists">touted by scientists</a> as having the capacity to transform the earth’s imperilled future – potentially preventing millions of deaths a year and containing the climate crisis.</p>
