      <h1>Goodale: How to make progress on prairie priorities?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T17:37:18+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 17:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/ralph-goodale" target="_blank">Ralph Goodale</a></address>
      <p>The regional nature of Canadian politics, as played out in the recent federal election, presents both Conservatives and Liberals with serious challenges.</p>
      <p>Voters in an angry mood in Saskatchewan and Alberta wagered all their parliamentary seats (except one in Edmonton) on the Conservatives forming government. But that approach foundered when Andrew Scheer failed to generate any meaningful enthusiasm in the rest of the country.</p>
      <p>To overcome the reality that Canada’s two major resource-based provinces are now without direct representation in the federal government, the prime minister must grapple structurally and substantively with an obvious disconnect in the Prairies.</p>
      <p>There is no quick fix. It will take time and concrete accomplishments to replace fear and loathing with a decent level of trust and confidence. Welcome are the moderate western voices calling for serious, rational engagement to achieve what the Prairies need. Also welcome is the prime minister’s commitment to treat this issue with the gravity it deserves.</p>
      <p>As a start, the government has reiterated its determination to complete the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. It is in the national interest. It is fully approved. Construction has begun. The government has invested $4.5 billion to get it done in the proper way. And on October 21, a strong majority voted in favour of TMX.</p>
      <p>(Notably, this is the fifth large energy infrastructure project supported by this government, including Keystone XL, Enbridge Line-3, LNG Canada, and a major electricity transmission line from Manitoba into the United States.)</p>
      <p>The election results also included a strong majority in favour of more vigorous efforts to deal with climate change, including pollution pricing. Figuring out how to deliver on this mandate in a manner that avoids further angst in Saskatchewan and Alberta will require much careful thought:</p>
      <p>Courts of Appeal in both Saskatchewan and Ontario ruled that pollution pricing is an essential part of any credible plan to combat climate change, and that pricing is effective in reducing greenhouse gases. How can these points — necessity and efficacy — be demonstrated more convincingly to relieve prairie doubts?</p>
      <p>Can federal pollution pricing exemptions be adjusted to better accommodate key prairie sectors like agriculture, junior oil and gas, and small business, as provincial governments had previously done in some cases?</p>
      <p>Can the regulatory system be improved to provide more clarity, certainty and timeliness?</p>
      <p>Can the federal government better offset the job losses and dislocations in the energy sector caused by the drastic drop in global oil prices since 2014?</p>
      <p>Can federal support be increased for tangible, job-creating investments in clean energy technologies and green power generation, such as geothermal, biomass, solar and wind?</p>
      <p>Can all parts of the country pull together on a modern east/west electricity transmission grid to spread the advantages of hydro power, and is there common agreement on a new natural gas supply line from the West to Eastern Canada?</p>
      <p>In the swirl of controversy about equalization, can premiers use the Council of the Federation to develop a consensus on how to improve the current formula, which was devised by the Harper government?</p>
      <p>None of these questions have easy solutions. While earnest efforts are made to find answers, goodwill might be developed on another vital front — agriculture— by speedy action on items in the Liberal platform.</p>
      <p>That includes strengthening business risk management tools for farmers, easier intergenerational transfers of family farms, greater use of crops like canola in biofuels, rewarding land management practices that enhance carbon sinks, and expanding Farm Credit Canada.</p>
      <p>Finally, a new federal Water Agency could pick up the historic mantle of the PFRA (Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration) to help flood-proof, drought-proof and diversify prairie agriculture, including the construction of a major new water channel to link Lake Diefenbaker with the Qu’Appelle Valley.</p>
      <p>All of this is important to the Prairies, and could help to demonstrate federal sincerity on western concerns.</p>
