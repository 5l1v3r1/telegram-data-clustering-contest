      <p>BEIRUT — Lebanese security forces will boost measures near the country’s banks that have been closed for more than a week over fears by employees for their safety amid nationwide unrest.</p>
      <p>Police said in a statement Saturday that there will be more patrols near banks.</p>
      <p>Lebanon’s financial troubles have worsened since mass protests began on Oct. 17, and snowballed into calls for the entire political elite to step down.</p>
      <p>Banks reopened Nov. 1 after a two-week closure amid the protests but depositors have rushed to withdraw their money while the country’s various lenders imposed varying capital controls.</p>
      <p>In some banks, customers insulted employees after they were told they cannot withdraw as much money as they want.</p>
      <p>The banks closed again on Nov. 9, and employees have been on strike since then.</p>
