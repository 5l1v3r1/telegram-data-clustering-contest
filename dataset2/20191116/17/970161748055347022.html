      <p>The new season of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/american-crime-story/">American Crime Story</a> has found its star, casting Clive Owen in the role of former US President Bill Clinton.</p>
      <p>The next installment of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ryan-murphy/">Ryan Murphy</a>’s anthology series will tackle the impeachment scandal that hit Clinton after his affair with secretary Monica Lewinsky was uncovered.</p>
      <p>He was charged with perjury and obstruction of justice, although he wasn’t actually impeached as president, with the American senate instead voting him to clear Clinton of the charges.</p>
      <p>Now, <a href="https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/impeachment-american-crime-story-clive-owen-bill-clinton-1203406296/">Variety</a> reports that the Gosford Park actor will be taking the leading role of the US President. Lady Bird star Beany Feldstein will be portraying Lewinsky.</p>
      <p>American Horror Story regular Sarah Paulson will also be undergoing another dramatic transformation in the series as Linda Tripp, who became heavily involved in the scandal when she secretly recorded conversations with Lewinsky where she detailed her relationship with the then-President.</p>

      <p>Apparently, the role of First Lady Hilary Clinton is still being cast.</p>
      <p>Can we put Lady Gaga forward for this now?</p>

      <p>This will be the third season of American Crime Story – which has previously adapted both the OJ Simpson murder trial and the assassination of fashion designer Gianni Versace – both airing to critical and commercial acclaim.</p>
      <p>It has been confirmed that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/07/american-crime-story-brings-monica-lewinsky-board-season-based-bill-clinton-sex-scandal-10530931/">Monica Lewinsky will be producing the drama</a>, working alongside Murphy.</p>
      <p>The story will be based on a book written by Jeffrey Toobin called A Vast Conspiracy: The Real Story of the Sex Scandal That Nearly Brought Down a President.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the new season, FX CEO John Landgraf explained: ‘This franchise re-examines some of the most complicated, polarising stories in recent history in a way that is relevant, nuanced and entertaining.</p>
      <p>‘Impeachment: American Crime Story will likewise explore the overlooked dimensions of the women who found themselves caught up in the scandal and political war that cast a long shadow over the Clinton presidency.’</p>
      <p>American Crime Story is just one jewel in the crown of Murphy’s television empire. The Glee creator’s horror anthology <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/american-horror-story-1984-finale-leaves-massive-plot-hole-and-fans-are-confused-11147110/">American Horror Story most recently wrapped its ninth season with a massive plot hole</a>.</p>
      <p>There’s also the troubling news <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/29/american-horror-story-faces-ending-good-10th-season-11006795/">that the show may be ending with its tenth season</a>, which is set to air next year,</p>

      <p>Series fixture Paulson was absent from the most recent series, but has said <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/28/sarah-paulson-needs-part-american-horror-story-eyes-season-10-11001275/">she ‘needs’ to be a part of the show again</a>.</p>
