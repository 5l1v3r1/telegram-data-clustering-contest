      <p>Today is the day that Colin Kaepernick has been waiting for as he gets set to show off what he has in a workout scheduled for several NFL teams in Atlanta.</p>
      <p>The former San Francisco is there, but he and NFL reps aren’t the only ones there for the event.</p>
      <p>Kaepernick’s workout is being held at the Atlanta Falcons’ practice facility in Flower Branch, Georgia and some reporters made note of the many protestors who came out to show their displeasure of him getting this opportunity.</p>

      <p>The irony in these guys using their 1st amendment rights to protest a protestor…who also used his 1st amendment rights.</p>
      <p>It should be noted that he also had some supporters.</p>
