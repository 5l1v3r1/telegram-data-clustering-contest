      <p>Despite incredible popularity, there’s been a ton of confusion around the cinematic future of Deadpool. The <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2454635/disney-just-approved-the-merger-with-fox?pv=search">Disney/Fox merger</a> has seemingly caused delays in development for both <i>Deadpool 3</i> and the <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2422232/x-force-what-we-know-so-far"><i>X-Force</i></a> film that will likely feature Ryan Reynolds’ iconic foul-mouthed hero. And one of the franchise’s stars, TJ Miller, has some thoughts about whether a threequel should even happen.</p>
      <p>On November 15, TJ Miller was a guest on <a href="https://adamcarolla.com/tj-miller-and-mark-geragos/?fbclid=IwAR0bzC70EwX7vAzvqx32_DAAihU19FFnZWgB3yzEHSqA7l56yGDs_5ZGSDQ">The Adam Carolla Show</a>, where he discussed, among other things, his line of hot sauce and the future of the <i>Deadpool</i> franchise. The actor gave an update, to his understanding, as to where the film’s creators are in the development process, saying:</p>
      <blockquote>You know they don't have -- they are doing <i>X-Force</i>, so Deadpool the character and Cable, I think, and some of the other characters went in there in X-Force and there are just now so many characters in that world that there wasn't really room for me to do <i>X-Force</i>. And so, because they're doing <i>X-Force</i>, they haven't decided if they want to do <i>Deadpool 3</i>. And to be honest, I almost would rather they didn't. And here's why.</blockquote>
      <p>TJ Miller went on to explain that he has very specific concerns about how successful a subsequent <i>Deadpool</i> film could be -- at least, as far as quality is concerned. He said:</p>
      <blockquote><i>The Hangover II</i> was a lot of fun. <i>The Hangover III</i> felt like a cash grab. ... I think <i>Deadpool 2</i>, we knocked it out of the park. I really think it ended up being great, and I was worried about that. So what if <i>Deadpool 3</i> is <i>eh</i>? Then you just kind of look at the whole thing and that's the one [that ruins it]?</blockquote>
      <p>Despite TJ Miller’s uncertainty and reservations, it seems like the future of <i>Deadpool 3</i> hinges more on “when” rather than “if.” Writer <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2465379/deadpool-writer-clarifies-plans-for-x-force-and-deadpool-3">Rhett Reese</a> made it clear that as far as he knows, the third chapter is set to come after the <i>X-Force</i> movie. <i>Deadpool</i>’s <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2476776/deadpool-creator-says-the-threequel-will-happen-soon">co-creator said</a> it’s coming “soon.” And earlier this year, Ryan Reynolds revealed that <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2465528/ryan-reynolds-is-already-working-on-deadpool-3">he’s developing</a> the series’ next installment.</p>
      <p>What’s less clear is TJ Miller’s future with <i>Deadpool</i>. Since 2017, he’s faced accusations of bullying and sexual assault, on top of other legal problems. His <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2384311/the-backstory-behind-tj-miller-leaving-silicon-valley-is-allegedly-starting-to-come-out">chaotic stint and subsequent departure from <i>Silicon Valley</i></a> in 2017 also made headlines. And we know for sure that <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2414971/a-deadpool-2-character-whos-not-returning-for-the-x-force-movie">he won’t be a part of <i>X-Force</i></a>. While Weasel is most certainly woven into the fabric of the series if the <i>Deadpool</i> team chooses to keep TJ Miller on board, it will most certainly be controversial. So, for the time being, we’ll have to join him and everyone else, and just wait for more news.</p>
