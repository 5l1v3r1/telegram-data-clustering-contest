      <p>Netizens are debating over <b>V App</b> being a platform where idols are exposed to hate comments in real-time without any measures to protect them. On November 16, <b>SBS</b>'s investigative television series '<b>Unanswered Questions</b>' aired an episode titled 'The Rumor of the Rumor of the Rumor, Who Killed Jin Li'. </p>
      <p>The episode attempted to uncover the truth behind what exactly could have led to such a tragic outcome. An insider from <b>SM Entertainment</b> has shared <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/sulli">Sulli </a>has been seeing a therapist once a week since 4 or 5 years ago to manage her mental health. However, it seems that was not enough to protect her from malicious mean comments, family and personal affairs. </p>
      <p>The program also interviewed a few hate commenters, and they shared she should have endured those comments because she is in the public eye as a celebrity. In one of the interviews, one commenter said <i>"Being a celebrity doesn't only garner love and positive attention. They are supposed to receive hate comments and they should endure and embrace that as part of them being a celebrity. I didn't tell her to commit suicide. I don't care if she's dead or alive."  </i>A YouTuber who posted a video about Sulli in another interview said,<i> "If you are going to whine about hate comments, you shouldn't be a celebrity."</i></p>

      <p>Sulli has previously said <i>"I don't like reading hate comments. I can't read emotions in the text so it really scares me. I wish they could say it in a less hateful way." </i>in her last live stream. </p>
      <p>After the broadcast, it sparked a debate among Netizens over V App where idols live stream and interact with fans in real-time by reading their comments during the stream. They have pointed out there is really no measure to protect them from receiving hate comments in real-time, and having a paywall can't stop them from commenting as some malicious commenters are known to purchase memberships to post hateful comments. </p>
      <p>What are your thoughts on this issue? </p>
