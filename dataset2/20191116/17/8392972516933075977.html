      <h1>I'm A Celebrity's James Haskell says he won't miss sex with Chloe Madeley while he's in the jungle</h1>
      <h2>Rugby player says food will be all that's on his mind</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T17:45:48+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 17:45</time> by <a rel="author">Entertainment Daily</a></address>
      <p>James Haskell has said he won't miss having sex with wife Chloe Madeley while taking part in <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a>... because he will be too consumed with hunger.</p>
      <p>The rugby star, 34, is married to Chloe Madeley, 32, the daughter of daytime television legends Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan.</p>
      <p>She has previously boasted she has daily sex sessions with her hubby - but James says he won't have the energy to think about missing out on their passion while he's in the jungle.</p>
      <p>However, the hulking heavyweight star does have a tactic to help keep him focused on jungle matters during their temporary TV separation.</p>

      <p>He told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/im-a-celebrity/10356548/im-a-celebrity-james-haskhall-wont-miss-sex-wife/">The Sun</a>: "I think I’ll be able to stay calm.</p>
      <p>"When you’re on 700 calories and everything smells of smoke, I’ll be fine. I’ll just throw myself in the creek."</p>
      <aside>I think the reality is I’m desperately going to miss my wife.</aside>
      <p>However, James also admitted it will be "very, very bizarre" to not be in Chloe's company after being "pretty much inseparable" since they first met five years ago.</p>
      <p>He added: "I think the reality is I’m desperately going to miss my wife."</p>

      </p>
      <p>James also said the hardest aspect of being apart is not being able to keep her updated on his goings on, as the couple are used to speaking ten times a day.</p>
      <p>However, asked about whether he could stomach a kangaroo's anus, James went on to joke he's swallowed some "pretty terrible things" in his time.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, it could take a serious amount of cash to get him to open up about those experiences.</p>
      <p>He added: "What’s the worst? I couldn’t possibly tell you that. Wait until my autobiography or pay me 100 grand, then I’ll start talking."</p>
