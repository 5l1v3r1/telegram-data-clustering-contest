      <h1>Photos of Ford's electric Mustang Mach-E leak ahead of its big reveal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T17:38:44+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 17:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mashable.com/author/aperry/" target="_blank">Alex Perry</a></address>
      <p>Someone at Ford hit publish a little too early.</p>
      <p>Ahead of its planned Sunday reveal, the Ford website briefly allowed clever users to see the full webpage for the electric Mustang Mach-E. This was spotted by the enterprising folks at <a href="https://www.macheforum.com/site/threads/discovered-2021-mustang-mach-e-official-page-w-pricing-models-specs-video-etc.49/">Mach-E Forums</a>, who posted (alleged) screenshots from the page showing pictures of the car before its full unveiling.</p>
      <p>Ford quickly realized its mistake and fixed the site, but the "damage" was already done. The leaks, assuming they're accurate, revealed five models and their base price points, per <a href="https://jalopnik.com/2020-ford-mustang-mach-e-heres-the-car-price-and-0-60-1839875945">Jalopnik</a>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mach-E Select for $43,895</li>
        <li>Mach-E Premium for $50,600</li>
        <li>Mach-E California Route 1 for $52,400</li>
        <li>Mach-E First Edition for $59,900</li>
        <li>Mach-E GT for $60,500</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The compact SUV that bears a passing resemblance to its namesake comes in rear or all-wheel drive, with different builds coming with between 230 and 300 miles of range. Some models, like the First Edition, can allegedly get from zero to 60 in less than five seconds.</p>
      <p>All in all, it's pretty competitive with the Tesla Model Y in terms of price and features, according to comparisons put together by <a href="https://electrek.co/2019/11/15/tesla-model-y-vs-ford-mustang-mach-e-specs-comparison/">Electrek</a>. Tesla's equivalent has more cargo space, but Ford wins on zero to 60 acceleration, generally speaking.</p>
      <p>The existence of the Mustang Mach-E is no secret, as Ford has been openly advertising the car's reveal recently. Idris Elba is going to be involved with the Sunday night unveiling in some capacity, for all of you fans of <i>The Wire </i>or <i>Luther</i> out there.Â </p>

      <p>Attaching the Mustang name to Ford's big, new all-electric car could lend it a level of perceived coolness to give it an edge over the competition. The <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/electricvehicles/electric-vehicles-tax-credits-and-other-incentives">federal tax credit</a> of up to $7,500 for EV purchases is also sure to make this a tempting proposition for enthusiasts.</p>
