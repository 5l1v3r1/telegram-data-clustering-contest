      <p>Renowned for its unique and awe-inspiring Christmas displays, SM Aura Premier’s much-awaited tree lighting ceremony at the mall’s Main Atrium revealed a 33-ft spectacle adorned with golden eventails, opulent feathers, and a resplendent phoenix as its highlight feature. The mall welcomed guests and customers through a festive circus performance featuring an array of international and local acrobats, jugglers, and aerialists. <b>Flight of Lights</b> Taking inspiration from the phoenix, SM Aura Premier invites all to experience an immersive journey, entitled “Flight of Lights”, which features <i>two </i>interactive light displays, in partnership with Huawei Mobile Philippines. The first of the displays, located by the Christmas tree centrepiece, is a golden bird cage which the public can enter in and experience an interactive light show. As participants form their hands into a particular shape, a phoenix will immerge and take flight above their heads. The Skypark at the fifth floor greets visitors with swing sets which glow brighter with every movement, allowing guests to be enthralled with a first-hand experience of creating their own light as they fly higher and higher. Surrounding the swing sets are glowing, moving lights that mimic fireflies. Both displays in the “Flight of Lights” exhibit is open to all <i>for free </i>until January 7, 2020. Making more picture-perfect memories, families will surely be thrilled as SM Aura Premier treats its customers to a harp exhibit by HarpRoom on November 22 – 24 at the main entrance. At the main mall atrium, guests can enjoy chorale performances on December 1 and 8, Letters to Santa Workshop on December 6 and 7, and Santa’s Meet and Greet on December 24 and 25.
