      <p>Sogakope (V/R), Nov. 16, GNA - Nana Rex Owusu Ansah, the Chairman of the Local Government Service Council, has reminded Civil Servants to stay away from politics as they serve the public interest.</p>
      <p>He said they should shun activities like assisting their District Chief Executives (DCEs) in politics in order not to undermine the trust and integrity society reposed in them. </p>
      <p>“You are not to assist your DCE in doing politics, let the politics be done by the DCEs and your members of Parliament alone, do not let their politics enter your office because the Local Government Service Council will not defend you when caught," he said.</p>
      <p>Nana Owusu Ansah was speaking at this year’s Consultative Meeting of the Local Government Service Council at Sogakope in the Volta Region.</p>
      <p>“It is the right of everybody to vote and we cannot prevent that. We are just saying you cannot participate in politics openly, by declaring your support for a particular political party in public.”</p>
      <p>“If you want to do this, you have to first resign from your current position as a Civil Servant before you even declare your intention to participate in active politics,” he said.</p>
      <p>Madam Grace Bediako, the National Development Planning Commission Representative on the Council, advised Civil Servants not to be swayed by political influences and adhere to their Constitutional mandate.</p>
