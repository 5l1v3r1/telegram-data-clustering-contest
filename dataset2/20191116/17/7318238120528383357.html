      <p>China has sent its soldiers onto the streets of Hong Kong to clean up the debris after more anti-government protests.</p>
      <p>A city spokesman said it was a “voluntary community activity” by the People's Liberation Army (PLA).</p>
      <p>The spokesman said the city government did not request assistance from the PLA, which has stayed confined to its garrison during six months of protests.</p>
      <p>Although the protests have shrunk in size they've grown increasingly violent and often caused chaos.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, hundreds of Beijing's supporters came out to support the soldiers, who are rarely seen on the streets.</p>
      <p>They're only supposed to deploy if the Hong Kong government gives its permission.</p>

      <p>The protests were sparked by the government's decision to submit legislation that would have allowed the extradition of criminal suspects to the mainland.</p>
      <p>Activists saw that as an erosion of Hong Kong’s autonomy under the “one country, two systems” formula which was implemented in 1997, when Britain returned the territory to China.</p>
      <p>The bill has been withdrawn, but the protests have expanded into a wider resistance movement. Activist say they're against as the increasing influence of Communist China in the city.</p>
      <p>Also on Saturday rebellious students and anti-government protesters abandoned their occupation of nearly all of Hong Kong’s universities.</p>
      <p>It came after a near week-long siege by police, but at least one major campus remained under control of demonstrators.</p>
