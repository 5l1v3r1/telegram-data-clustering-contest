      <p>Sunshine is expected this weekend, but rain is in the forecast for Wednesday — and might even begin Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>Saturday’s high temperature is expected to reach 80 degrees, while Sunday’s high is forecast at 76.</p>
      <p>There’s a 10 percent chance of rain Tuesday night — mainly, after 10 p.m., according to the National Weather Service.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, the high temperature is expected to drop to 63 degrees. And rain is in the forecast for Wednesday and Thursday.</p>
      <p>As for the amount of rain expected, “there’s still an awful lot of uncertainty,” said Clay Morgan, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.</p>
      <p>Meteorologists are watching two storm systems. If both come together, an inch of rain for the Las Vegas Valley — and up to a foot of snow in some mountain locations — could be possible, he said.</p>
