      <p>Stefanos Tsitsipas stunned favourite Roger Federer to reach the final on his debut at the ATP Finals on Saturday, beating the six-time champion 6-3 6-4 at the O2 Arena.</p>
      <p>The stylish 21-year-old, the first Greek to qualify for tournament in half a century, soaked up everything Federer threw at him and returned it with interest to subdue the Swiss great.</p>
      <p>Federer, 17 years older than his opponent, was unusually profligate when his chances came along, failing to convert his first 10 break points.</p>
      <p>The 20-time Grand Slam champion made a sloppy start, botching two smashes in his first service game and Tsitsipas took advantage to break with an angled forehand winner.</p>
      <p>Federer wasted three break points when Tsitsipas served at 4-2 then lost out in a marathon 13-minute ninth game as Tsitsipas served for the first set. Tsitsipas finally bagged the opener on his seventh set point.</p>
      <p>Looking rattled Federer dropped serve to love early in the second set but hit back immediately to finally convert a break point. Tsitsipas showed remarkable poise though, blanking out the cheers for Federer to break again with an angled forehand.</p>
      <p>Federer looked jaded near the end and struggled to hold serve at 3-5, but at least asked the question of Tsitsipas’s nerve as the Greek served for a place in Sunday’s climax.</p>
      <p>Again Federer had break points, reaching 15-40, but Tsitsipas would not be denied the biggest final of his career and hit back to finish an absorbing clash with an ace.</p>
      <p>Tsitsipas will face either defending champion Alexander Zverev or Dominic Thiem in the final.</p>
