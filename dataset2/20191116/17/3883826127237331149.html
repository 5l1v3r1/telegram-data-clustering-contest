        <b>Scotland are still a "work in progress" after securing a 2-1 Euro 2020 qualification win in Cyprus, says manager Steve Clarke.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Clarke says he was left with a "smile on my face" after goals by Ryan Christie and John McGinn helped the Scots into third in Group I.</p>
      <p>Beating Kazakhstan on Tuesday would be a third win in a row for a side who can only reach the finals by the play-offs.</p>
      <p>"That would set us up nicely for those game in March," Clarke said.</p>

      <p>Christie's strike gave Scotland the lead, with McGinn adding a second after former Rangers and Dundee winger Georgios Efrem had hauled the home side level.</p>
      <p>It followed a comprehensive 6-0 win over San Marino at Hampden last month after four consecutive defeats at the hands of Belgium and Russia.</p>
      <p>"In Russia, the reaction to going behind wasn't great, but tonight the reaction was really good and we got back in front with a great team goal," said Clarke.</p>
      <p>"We knew it would be a difficult game but I thought when we went in front we were the better team. We showed a little bit of resilience to get the three points that we wanted.</p>
      <p>"I'm not going to say it was a fantastic performance - it was a good performance. Sometimes when you're coming out of the run of games that we're coming out of it's more important to win."</p>
      <p>Scotland did have rocky moments in the game, with an Efrem effort when the game was goalless appearing to cross the line after striking the crossbar.</p>
      <p>But after conceding 13 goals against Belgium and Russia, Clarke was happy to see his side keep Cyprus at just one goal.</p>
      <p>"We have things we can improve on in the team," he said, confirming that Steven Naismith is "fine" despite lasting just an hour.</p>
      <p>"If you want to be really good and scintillating going forward sometimes you have to sacrifice a little defensively.</p>
      <p>"Rather than going down the negative route I'd say we're still a work in progress."</p>
      <p>Cyprus coach Ran Ben Shimon was less content, though, suggesting that the "team that tried to play football lost this game".</p>
      <p>He noted his surprise at the number of "long balls" his side faced and also railed against the decision not to give Efrem's early strike.</p>
      <p>"It was the decisive moment in the game. To lead after six minutes would have been crucial. It was half a metre inside. It was a poor performance," he said.</p>
      <p>"I have respect for opponents but the better team lost."</p>
