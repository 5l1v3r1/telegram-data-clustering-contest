      <p>Manchester politicians have accused the government of ignoring an ‘industrial crisis’ after a major blaze tore through a block of student flats in Bolton.</p>
      <p>Local Labour leaders said <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/boris-johnson/">Boris Johnson</a> needs to go further in removing flammable cladding from UK buildings.</p>
      <p>They put pressure on the Prime Minister as he made his way to the region to visit fire crews and students affected by the blaze.</p>
      <p>An investigation is under way to establish the cause of the fire, which broke out at accommodation block The Cube on Friday night at 8.30pm and spread ‘extremely rapidly’.</p>
      <p>Witnesses say the flames ‘crawled up the cladding like it was nothing’.</p>
      <p>Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has said it was time for Boris Johnson to give families living in tower blocks with cladding ‘peace of mind’.</p>

      <p>He said The Cube’s high-pressure laminate cladding was concerning but didn’t qualify for funding in the same way as aluminium composite material (ACM).</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>He told Sky News: ‘It does not have the ACM cladding which is now banned, but it does have a type of cladding which does cause concern.</p>
      <p>‘There will be many people living in buildings with this cladding today who will be very worried.</p>
      <p>‘The Prime Minister is visiting later and we will see if we now need to go further to remove the cladding and give these families peace of mind.</p>
      <p>‘The response from the community in Bolton has been fantastic. We want to pay tribute to everybody involved.’</p>
      <p>Following the Grenfell Tower tragedy, Mr Burnham set up the Greater Manchester High Rise Task Force to provide fire safety reassurance for every building in the region.</p>
      <p>He said he would be asking the Government for more money to remove flammable cladding from buildings to prevent future incidents.</p>

      <p>Echoing calls for more resources, Manchester housing chief Paul Dennett criticised a ‘cladding lottery’</p>
      <p>He said: ‘Government has made resources available for ACM. This [student block cladding] is high pressure laminate.</p>
      <p>‘So we will be asking government for more funds and more money to really deal with what is an industrial crisis the UK are facing at the moment in terms of cladding on buildings.</p>
      <p>‘There is a lot of work to be done.’</p>

      <p>Boris Johnson was pictured meeting locals who had gone to Bolton University to donate clothes and food to the students affected by the fire.</p>
      <p>His visit came after the Fire Brigade Union called for a complete overhaul of UK fire safety and condemned cuts to fire and rescue services.</p>

      <p>Matt Wrack, FBU general secretary, said: ‘It’s deeply troubling to see fire spread rapidly up a building’s exterior again – a shocking indictment of the government’s shameful inaction after Grenfell. This is not how any building should react to a fire in the 21st century, let alone a building in which people live.</p>
      <p>‘We need to end the deregulation agenda and the disastrous cuts to our fire and rescue service. It’s time for a complete overhaul of UK fire safety before it’s too late.’</p>

      <p>Paramedics treated two people at the scene for minor injuries, including one person rescued by fire crews from an aerial platform, after the blaze broke out at about 8.30pm on Friday.</p>
      <p>Assistant Chief Fire Officer Dave Keelan, from Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service, said crews worked through the night to extinguish the blaze with more than 20 fire engines attending at the height of the incident.</p>
      <p>Pressure group Grenfell United said the fire in Bolton ‘brings back memories’ of the Grenfell Tower fire, and called for Government action.</p>
