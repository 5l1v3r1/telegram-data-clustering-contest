      <p>“The standard of quality control and service is top notch in Thyrocare. People need to know the world-class digital lab it has. My suggestion for Thyrocare will be to bring all their facilities to all the eight divisions and eventually to the entire country,” she said.</p>
      <p>Enam Ahmed Chaudhury, member of the Awami League’s Advisory Council, was present as special guest while Reaz Islam, the founding chairman of Thyrocare Bangladesh and CEO of LR Global, and Dr Velumani, promoter, chairman, managing director and CEO of Thyrocare, delivered key speeches.</p>
      <p>Reaz Islam said he was “extremely happy” to announce the achievement of the CAP accreditation.</p>
      <p>The healthcare sector of Bangladesh under the leadership of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has made “exemplary” achievement across all dimensions ranging from increasing life expectancy, decrease in child mortality and even the decrease in incidence of communicable diseases, the Thyrocare chairman said.</p>
      <p>Thyrocare is focused on playing “our part” to meet and exceed the health care plan articulated by Hasina and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, he said.</p>
      <p>“We are also excited to contribute and support the bold initiative of universal health care working with ministry of finance to make this a reality under the impeccable guidance of honourable finance minister [AHM Mustafa Kamal],” Reaz Islam said.</p>

      <p>“Ever since its inception five years ago, Thyrocare, despite heavy odds, has successfully engaged itself in providing quality and affordable diagnostic and preventive healthcare service to people who are handicapped and those who live in places where such facilities are not available,” Enam Ahmed said.</p>
      <p>The wings of Thyrocare “can reach everyone, everywhere”, which Enam Ahmed said was also one of the objectives of Hasina’s government.</p>
      <p>Dr Velumani said it was a “very special moment” for him.</p>
      <p>“We always believe that prevention is better than cure and Thyrocare focuses on preventive healthcare. It is also a matter of great pleasure for me to see Thyrocare contributing to create future leaders by initiating this scholarship,” he said.</p>
      <p>Diplomats, top government officials, dignitaries, and key practitioners were present on the occasion.</p>
      <p>A press conference was also held where the success story of Thyrocare was focused.</p>
      <p>Besides Reaz Islam and Dr Velumani, Thyrocare directors and vice chairmen Sajedur Seraj and Sohail Humayun were present.</p>
