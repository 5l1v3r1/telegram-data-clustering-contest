      <h1>Hong Kong's LGBT community holds pride rally after police ban parade</h1>

      <p>About 1,000 people took part in Hong Kong’s LGBT community rally on Saturday after police banned the annual gay pride march.</p>
      <p>The carnival-like demonstration took place in Central’s Edinburgh Place under the banner ‘Equal Justice, Equal Rights’ as protesters called for legislation against sexual orientation-based discrimination, fair treatment and better protection for sexual minorities.</p>
      <p>It comes under the backdrop of months of anti-government protests in the stricken city.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong Pride’s organising committee had its application to march through the city rejected on Thursday by police stating it was not ‘in the interests of public safety and public order’, reported the South China Morning Post.</p>
      <p>Among the colourful outfits and rainbow flags where those wearing masks and dressed in black – clothing that has become the signature look of anti-government protesters.</p>

      <p>Central to their demands, are the scrapping of the extradition bill – an independent probe into the use of force by police – along with amnesty for arrested protesters, an end to labeling the protest as a riot and universal suffrage.</p>

      <p>Mo, a student from the LGBT community who had taken part in the previous two pride marches, said: ‘Every year, the pride parade is held.</p>
      <p>‘Police had only rejected this year’s march two days before despite an application being filed much earlier.</p>
      <p>‘I believe when there is no police presence, everything will be peaceful.’</p>

      <p>Others understood the police clampdown over concerns it could be ‘high-jacked for other purposes’.</p>
      <p>Protests in the city have endured for more than sixth months – originally against a proposed bill that would have allowed suspects to be extradited to mainland China.</p>
      <p>It was scrapped in October but demonstrators fear the bill could be resurrected. Activists also feel Hong Kong’s autonomy and Western-style civil liberties, promised when the former British colony was returned to China in 1997, have eroded.</p>
