      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jacqueline-jossa/">Jacqueline Jossa</a> will be the first star to quit <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>…Get Me Out Of Here, according to a psychic.</p>
      <p>Speaking ahead of the show, which starts on Sunday night, psychic Chris Riley believes the pressure might get too much for the former EastEnders star.</p>
      <p>He has even predicted that she might walk from the ITV show before the first half of the series.</p>
      <p>‘Jacqueline is going to find it really difficult being away from home, she’ll feel incredibly homesick,’ he told <b>Metro.co.uk</b>.</p>
      <p>‘I’m seeing that she may try to walk out of the jungle in the first half of the series, hopefully the team’s morale and friendships will convince her to stay.’</p>
      <p>Chris goes on to explain that he feels the mum-of-two will be an easy target for the bushtucker trials and that the public will vote for her to do them regularly.</p>

      <p>‘The public will vote both her and another female into many of the early trials, a result which will help Jacqueline’s personality to shine through.</p>
      <p>‘I’m seeing that Jacqueline has fears, as we all do, although some are quite strong, possibly leading her to experience a panic attack and subsequently pull out of her first or second trial.’</p>

      <p>Ahead of her journey to Australia Jacqueline vowed to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/im-celebritys-jacqueline-jossa-insists-not-doormat-hits-back-dan-osborne-speculation-11081589/">‘prove she’s not a doormat’ after working on things with husband Dan Osborne.</a></p>
      <p>On how she will come across to I’m A Celeb viewers, Chris added: ‘I truly feel that Jacqueline is very strong-willed, as she says, and she’ll definitely want to prove this to the viewers.</p>
      <p>‘Although Jacqueline might seem a little shy and reserved at first, she will soon come out of her shell, drawing towards an older female in the jungle for support. Jacqueline is down to earth, so she’ll be very relatable for viewers.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘I feel that Jacqueline will also form a close bond with two males specifically in the beginning, she’ll value this encouragement and male power.</p>
      <p>‘As the series progresses, I’m seeing some tense discussions and personality clashes; I get the feeling that she’ll have to bite her tongue on several occasions, something that Jacqueline will have to juggle with her hope to be seen as strong-willed.’</p>
