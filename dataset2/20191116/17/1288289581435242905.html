      <p><b>Maharashtra govt formation Updates: </b>Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari today announced a relief package of Rs 8000 per hectare up to 2 hectare for agricultural Kharif crops and Rs 18,000 per hectare up to 2 hectares for horticulture/perennial crops, following damage to crops by unseasonal rains.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the meeting of Shiv Sena, NCP, <a href="http://www.financialexpress.com/tag/congress/">Congress</a> delegation with Maharashtra Governor has been postponed till further notice. The reasons behind the meeting, which was scheduled to take place today at 4.30 pm, being put on hold were not known immediately.
