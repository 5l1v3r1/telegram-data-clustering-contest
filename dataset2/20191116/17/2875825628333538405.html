      <h1>Mum praises teacher's great idea to end parents' Christmas present buying pressure</h1>
      <h2>Steff Ravenhall's daughter returned from St Patrick's Roman Catholic Voluntary Aided School with a letter from her teacher that suggested a king-hearted alternative to Christmas gifts</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T17:15:46+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 17:15</time> by <a rel="author">Hannah Graham</a></address>
      <p>Parents used to the pressure of finding the perfect gift for their children's teacher have praised her for requesting they do something "heart warming" instead.</p>
      <p>Last week Steff Ravenhall's daughter Harriet Warring, 7, came home with a letter from her teacher Mrs Gardner.</p>
      <p>Preempting the mountains of chocolates and red wines that would come her way, the teacher thanked parents for their "kind generosity" of Christmases gone by but asked that it be redirected this year, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/mum-shares-teachers-brilliant-idea-17268030">Chronicle Live reported.</a></p>
      <p>"I would like to reduce your stress a little and ask that you don't buy me a gift," she wrote.</p>
      <p>"I thoroughly enjoy teaching your children and my job is a pleasure to do."</p>
      <p>This was no present ban however.</p>

      <p>The deputy head and year two teacher urged parents at the St Patrick's Roman Catholic Voluntary Aided School in Dipton, County Durham to send an anonymous donation of no more than Â£2 to help those in need.</p>
      <p>The request had a educational edge as well.</p>
      <p>She said: "This half term we will be focusing on money in maths and the real meaning of Christmas in our RE lessons.</p>
      <p>"With this in mind I would like the children to be involved in the social responsibility of giving and and kindness and plan to support a local family."</p>
      <p>Once the envelopes had been received, the children would count up the cash inside and use it to buy an item from a local shop.</p>
      <p>Steff, 26, was so impressed by the idea she shared a photo of the letter on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> in the hope of encouraging other schools to follow suit.</p>
      <p>The mum said: "I just thought it was really heart-warming, and it obviously takes the pressure off, because you do worry about getting the teachers presents at this time of year.</p>

      <p>"My daughter has been to a few different schools and it's always a topic of conversation for the parents, who is getting something, who is not going to bother, how much they're spending. Everyone just wants to get it right.</p>
      <p>"The bit that got me the most was the fact that it was going to a local family. It's an important age, in year two, to be learning about the value of money, which is a really important lesson as well. And it teaches them that it's not just about receiving, it's about giving back.</p>
      <p>"I've never seen another school do anything like this, lots of teachers will say to you 'oh, don't bother', but actually getting a letter saying 'here's what you can do instead' and there's a lesson kids are learning at the same time, that's what's really good about it."</p>
      <p>The mum says she's already received messages online from teachers hoping to share the idea, and Steff's post has been shared hundreds of times on Facebook.</p>
      <p>One woman commented: "This is an amazing idea and I wish other schools would do this!"</p>
      <p>And another said: "This is a wonderful idea! Well done that teacher."</p>
