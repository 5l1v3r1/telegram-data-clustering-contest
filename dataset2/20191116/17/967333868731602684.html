      <p>Previously, Turkey <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201911051077229447-turkey-confirms-capture-of-al-baghdadis-sister-calls-it-success-in-fight-against-terrorism/">confirmed detaining a number of relatives of al-Baghdadi</a>, including his sister, 65-year-old Rasmiya Awad, his brother-in-law, and his wife, Asma Fawzi Muhammad Al-Qubaysi. The latter, according to AFP's report, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201911081077260218-al-baghdadis-first-wife-reportedly-leaked-daesh-secrets-following-her-capture-by-turkey/">"volunteered a lot of information" about the Daesh*</a> leader and his terrorist organisation.</p>
      <h3>Death of al-Baghdadi</h3>
      <p>US President Donald Trump announced that Daesh* leader al-Baghdadi died on 27 October as a result of a US raid on his hideout, blowing himself up after being chased into a dead-end tunnel. The US claimed that due to his body having been mutilated by the blast, al-Baghdadi was identified via a DNA test on the spot, with his remains buried at sea within 24 hours of his death.</p>
      <p>The terrorist organisation later confirmed the death of al-Baghdadi and named Abu Ibrahim al-Hashemi al-Qurashi as their new leader.</p>
