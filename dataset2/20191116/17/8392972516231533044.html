      <p>Child actors Isabella and William Flanagan, who play cousins Hope Stape and Joseph Brown on <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/">Coronation Street</a>, have posed for a cute photo together.</p>
      <p>Their mum Rachel posted a picture of the twins on her Instagram page.</p>

      <p>She captioned the post: "Friday feeling. Own clothes day then filming to end another crazy week."</p>
      <p>Fans rushed to comment on the post.</p>
      <p>One wrote: "Cute." A second said: "Absolutely gorgeous x."</p>
      <aside>Absolutely gorgeous.</aside>
      <p>The two actors have another soap star sibling: <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/emmerdales-april-is-big-sister-to-two-childstars/">Amelia Flanagan who plays April Windsor</a> in <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/">Emmerdale</a>.</p>
      <p>Both Isabella and William joined the cast of Coronation Street in 2017 and their characters have featured in significant storylines.</p>
      <p>Isabella's character Hope is currently being homeschooled by <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-fans-fear-jade-is-killer-john-stapes-sister/">tutor Jade</a>, who she and her mum Fiz met at a school in Birmingham.</p>

      <p>Hope went to a school in Birmingham which specialised in children with behaviour issues but returned to Weatherfield in August.</p>
      <p>Since her return however, it's clear Hope's behaviour hasn't improved.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-viewers-overjoyed-as-gemma-safely-delivers-quads/">Joseph has just become a big brother to quads</a>.</p>
      <p>His dad Chesney and future step-mum Gemma recently had four babies: two boys named <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-causes-confusion-over-gemmas-baby-name/">Aled and Bryn and two girls named Carys and Llio</a>.</p>
      <p>At first, Joseph didn't seem very interested in his new siblings, but he soon opened up to his dad and told him he's worried he wouldn't have time for him with four babies.</p>
      <p>But Chesney reassured Joseph that he would and that the quad's needed him and looked up to him.</p>
