      <h2>Latest Wolverhampton Wanderers news | The 22-year-old is yet to start in the Premier League under Nuno but has played back-to-back 90 minutes in the Europa League</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T17:35:48+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 17:35</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Wakefield</a></address>
      <p>Wolverhampton Wanderers defender Max Kilman has opened up on the time it has taken for him to reach the level required to play for the club’s first team.</p>
      <p>Kilman signed for <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> from non-league side Maidenhead United in the summer of 2018, and has since been battling for a place in manager Nuno Espirito Santo’s starting line-up.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old made his debut for Wolves in May this year as a substitute in Wolves’ 1-0 Premier League win over Fulham last season.</p>
      <p>Since then, the centre-back is yet to feature in the Premier League for Wolves, but has played a part in the cup competitions.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Kilman has played the full 90 minutes in Wolves’ back-to-back victories over Slovan Bratislava in the Europa League, and now the defender is eyeing a Premier League start.</p>
      <p>The defender has admitted that he needed time to get to the level required by Nuno to feature in the first-team.</p>
      <p>“It has been very tough because I have had to adapt,” Kilman told the Express &amp; Star.</p>
      <p>He added: “There has been a lot of room for improvement. It has been a long process but I think I needed quite a while to adapt to training full-time and all of that.</p>
