      <h1>Will.i.am Claims Racist Flight Attendant Called Police on Him for Not Putting Away Laptop</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T17:12:35+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 17:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xxlmag.com/author/cvernoncoleman/" target="_blank">C. Vernon Coleman II</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/tags/will-i-am/">Will.i.am</a> ran into some issues during a recent flight and claims racism was involved.</p>
      <p>Will put the airline on blast via Twitter on Friday night (Nov. 15). The alleged incident occurred as the Black Eyed Peas MC was on his way traveling through Australia on course from Brisbane to Sydney.</p>
      <p>"I‚Äôm currently on a flight from Brisbane to Sydney. I‚Äôm sorry to say me and my group have experienced they worse service due to a overly aggressive flight attendant," he posted. "I don‚Äôt want to believe she racist. But she has clearly aimed all her frustrations only at the people of colour."</p>
      <p>In what appears to be real-time updates of the incident, he follows up on the situation tweeting a photo of a police officer and adds more context, claiming this was all a result of him not hearing the order to put away his laptop.</p>
      <p>"This is how your greeted when you land from Brisbane to Sydney flying @qantas with a #RacistFlightattendant named Lorraine Marshall," he posted, putting the employee who treated him unfairly on blast. "She sent the police after me bacause I couldn‚Äôt hear the P.A while making beats on the plane wearing noise canceling headphones."</p>
      <p>He continued, "Your #RacistFlightattendant was beyond rude &amp; took it to the next level by calling the police on me. thank god the other passengers testified that SHE was out of Control üôèüèø the police finally let me go. imagine if the police were as aggressive as Lorraine Marshall."</p>

      <p>This isn't the first time Will has had a notable situation happen in the Land Down Under. Last year, he <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/10/will-i-am-faces-backlash-using-phone-during-black-eyed-peas-performance-australia/">faced backlash for using his phone during a show</a> the group performed in Australia. The Black Eyed Peas, <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2017/06/will-i-am-confirms-fergie-no-longer-part-of-black-eyed-peas/">sans Fergie</a>, released their most recent album <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/MASTERS-SUN-VOL-1-Explicit/dp/B07JFZ1M5X?SubscriptionId=AKIAJYPOGEBYCEUS42SQ&amp;tag=xxlmagtsm-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=B07JFZ1M5X">Masters of the Sun Vol. 1</a></i> in October 2018.</p>
      <p>The airline has yet to respond to the rapper's claims on Twitter. <i>XXL</i> has reached out to Qantas for comment.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúWe did this show in Atlanta on Ty [Dolla $ign]‚Äôs tour. We was all on the tour bus and it was a bunch of people I didn‚Äôt meet. Ty‚Äôs tour bus was like the fuckin‚Äô Source Awards. But everybody was on there‚ÄîTrouble, Migos, everybody. I‚Äôm going to introduce myself to everybody and everybody would be like, ‚ÄòCome on, dog, we know who you are. When we workin‚Äô? What we doin‚Äô?‚Äô That was crazy, but I brought Jermaine [Dupri] out. I brought Hoodrich Pablo Juan out and he did a song; I brought [Lil] Scrappy out and he did 'Head Bussa.' And then I closed my set with Jermaine and he did 'Welcome to Atlanta' in Atlanta and the whole crowd went crazy. Like, no one really brings JD out to do that, so I‚Äôm thinking that‚Äôs Jay-Z level. That‚Äôs crazy. Do we have footage? I need that.‚Äù</p>

      <p>"I had a room, right? So I go in my hotel room and it was a girl that worked there. I don't know if she got drunk and got bold to do it, but when I go back in the room, she came out the drawer. She hid in my room until I got back and came out of the drawer. I think we were in Houston. I put her out‚Äîyou gotta roll."</p>

      <p>‚ÄúWe were on the road with Dizzy Wright. I think it was like, Albuquerque, N.M. Or it might have been El Paso‚Äîone of those fuckin‚Äô places. There were a bunch of fans arguing and screaming in the parking lot. Our security‚Äîhis name is DJ‚Äîcame and got me and was like, ‚ÄòYo, you gotta check this out.‚Äô</p>
      <p>My first reaction is to jump in between them and try to make sure that everything‚Äôs cool, you know? Didn‚Äôt realize these kids were heavily gang-affiliated. You ever seen that movie, <i>Only the Strong</i>, where they sing, ‚ÄòBa, na, na, weh,‚Äô and they‚Äôre kinda stabbing at each other with knives and shit? It was some shit like that and I was in between them. They were trying to poke each other so I was like, ‚ÄòY‚Äôall wanna keep having hip-hop shows? Y‚Äôall gotta stop this shit right now,‚Äô so the crowd kinda dispersed. I foolishly thought it dispersed because I made an impact and I was like, 'Yeah, I fuckin‚Äô killed this shit, brought the peace in.' Two seconds later, you hear tires screeching‚Äîone of the kids who was involved in the tussle, his peoples had pulled up. Crowd scatters. I‚Äôm not a street dude, like, fuck that shit. So I was like fuck it, I booked it to the merch, behind the merch truck. I was duckin‚Äô and then the fighting still kept on going.</p>
      <p>Have you ever seen a hockey fight where they pull the shirt over? So these kids, one of them pulled the shirt over, he finally cut the other kid and he was just laying, bleeding in the parking lot. It was crazy. The police were on their own schedule. It was a good five, six minutes that passed. At a Dizzy Wright show, too. We‚Äôre like, peaceful; everybody‚Äôs chillin‚Äô.‚Äù</p>

Who the fuck threw this shit on the stage?' I see a group of dudes ganged up in the corner. I'm like, 'Yo listen, I'ma fuck yall niggas up!' I continue the show, go home. I go in my Instagram messages, Some girl hits me up. She goes 'Did you get the cookie, filled with gelato, that I threw on the stage?' I'm like, 'Why would you throw some shit on the stage? You threw a cookie of all things. You had niggas in the crowd like, 'Ohhh,' why you do that shit?' I followed her right after though. We're friends now. I just hit her up the other day like, 'Yo, you good?'"</p>
