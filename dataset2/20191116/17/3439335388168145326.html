      <p>Eddie Stansberry scored a career-high 28 points as host Hawaii beat Portland State 83-75 tonight.</p>
      <p>A turnstile crowd of 3,502 at the Stan Sheriff Center saw Stansberry make his first six attempts from 3-point range as the Rainbow Warriors improved to 3-1. The Vikings fell to 1-2.</p>
      <p>Stansberry scored 26 in UH’s win over Pacific last week.</p>
      <p>Matt Hauser led Portland State with 18 points.</p>
      <p>Drew Buggs scored 13 points, Samuta Avea added 12, and Zigmars Raimo contributed 10 for Hawaii.</p>
      <p>Stansberry made 6-of-7 shots from behind the 3-point line, and UH was 11-for-20 as a team on 3-pointers.</p>
      <p>UH had just a few rough moments against Portland State’s pressure defense, but mostly solved it, resulting in open shots.</p>
      <p>Buggs hit a 12-footer with 1 second left in the first half, and Hawaii led 40-38 at the break. Holland Woods of PSU started the second half scoring with a fast break basket, but Stansberry and Drew Buggs then hit 3-pointers and UH never lost its lead.</p>
      <p>Stansberry made all four of his first-half attempts from behind the 3-point line and had 14 points before the break.</p>
      <p>Freshman guard Justin Webster made his debut for UH and made his first shot as a Rainbow, a 3-pointer. He finished with four points.</p>
      <p>Hawaii’s next game is Monday at Illinois. The Rainbows return home for three games, starting with New Orleans on Nov. 24.</p>
