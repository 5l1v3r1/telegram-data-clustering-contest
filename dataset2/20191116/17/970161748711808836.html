      <p>A violent bully subjected his pregnant girlfriend to two vicious attacks where she was stripped naked, punched in the gut, and nearly thrown out of a window.</p>
      <p>Ashley Brazier, 31, of Whitstable in Kent, picked up his 7st 2lbs partner and tried to chuck her out the window after he noticed a man had ‘liked’ her Facebook photo.</p>
      <p>Brazier, who has a history of harassment, battery, and criminal damage, only failed because she managed to extend her body across the frame and resist.</p>
      <p>But her boyfriend’s anger only intensified and he pinned her to a wall by the throat with such force, he lifted her from the floor.</p>
      <p>He then chased her in a ‘petrifying’ game of ‘cat and mouse’, prosecutor Amy Nicholson told Canterbury Crown Court this week.</p>
      <p>Brazier then struck the pregnant victim in the face with her phone after accusing her of having an affair.</p>

      <p>The court also heard how a ‘spiteful and cruel’ Brazier had previously thrown ‘away her father’s ashes’ Ms Nicholson said.</p>

      <p>She added: ‘What happened has ruined her life.’</p>
      <p>Brazier was jailed for three years and nine months for grievous bodily harm and actual bodily harm.</p>
      <p>Brazier has 41 previous convictions, including two for harassment, six for battery, 10 for criminal damage, as well as multiple breaches of court orders.</p>
      <p>During the attack Brazier repeatedly spat in his victim’s face as she fought to escape. He slapped her so hard her ear rang.</p>
      <p>Brazier punched his girlfriend in the gut, dislodging her rib and puncturing her lung  – which doctors later had to inflate twice.</p>
      <p>He then stripped her and locked her out, which Judge Rupert Lowe described as his ‘signature attack’.</p>
      <p>Brazier only stopped when he realised the extent of her injuries.</p>

      <p>She was sent to the Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother Hospital in Margate, Kent, where doctors installed a drainage tap.</p>
      <p>The victim did not know she was in the early stages of pregnancy at the time of the assault.</p>
      <p>In an earlier attack, Brazier was suspicious of one of his partner’s texts while he was out drinking with friends in Ramsgate, Kent.</p>
      <p>He called her ‘a slag’, slapped her, pulled out clumps of her hair and spat in her face in front of a seven-month-old baby in June.</p>

      <p>Judge Rupert Lowe scalded Brazier for his campaign of violence and humiliation, adding that he posed a ‘significant risk to the public’ but could not impose an extended sentence because his powers were restricted.</p>
