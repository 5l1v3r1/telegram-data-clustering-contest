      <h1>Eddie Jones: I made two selection mistakes in World Cup final</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T17:27:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 17:27</time> by <a rel="author">ESPN</a></address>
      <p>England head coach Eddie Jones has said that he feels made two selection mistakes in his side's <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/rugby/report?gameId=292929&amp;league=164205">32-12 Rugby World Cup final defeat to South Africa</a>.</p>
      <p>Jones said that he should have started Harlequins's Joe Marler at loose-head prop over Saracens' Mako Vunipola, while the England coach also regrets his choice to stick with playing both George Ford and Owen Farrell in midfield.</p>
      <p>"I accept that I made two selection mistakes for the final," Jones said in his new autobiography <i>My Life and Rugby, </i>which is being serialised in <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/eddie-jones-book-extract-i-got-our-biggest-game-for-four-years-badly-wrong-dt0k5g9cr">the Times<i>.</i></a></p>
      <p>"I should have chosen Joe Marler ahead of Mako Vunipola at loosehead prop and reverted to the Owen Farrell-Manu Tuilagi-Henry Slade midfield we used against Australia.</p>
      <p>"George Ford could have come off the bench when we had got into the game. But you never know until the game starts.</p>
      <p>"You use the best available evidence and rely on your gut."</p>
      <p>England upset the All Blacks in the semifinal in Japan with a dominating 19-7 victory, but Jones has said that some of the post-match praise was "a bit over the top."</p>
      <p>"There's a psychological challenge after the kind of big win we achieved against the All Blacks," Jones added.</p>
      <p>"While we did play well, I thought the analysis was a bit over the top.</p>
      <p>"Everyone was slapping us on the back, saying how fantastic we were, how it was the best ever performance by an England team and the best ever win at a World Cup.</p>
      <p>"The praise was everywhere. The challenge is to bring the players back to reality. It changes the structure and narrative of the week."</p>
      <p>The Rugby Football Union (RFU) <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/rugby/story/_/id/27996594/rfu-want-eddie-jones-extend-contract-2023-rugby-world-cup">want to extend Jones' contract through to the 2023 Rugby World Cup</a>, with the Australian coach's current deal set to expire in 2021.</p>
