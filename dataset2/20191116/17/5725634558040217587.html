      </ul>
      <p>A biotech and a micro-cap ridesharing rental provider entered the public market this past week, and seven companies submitted initial filings.</p>
      <p>After delaying its offering in the previous week, 89bio (NASDAQ:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ETNB">ETNB</a>) priced its upsized $85 million IPO at the midpoint and popped 30% on its first day, the second highest of the 4Q19 so far, before finishing the week up 69%. The company's target indication NASH represents a multi-billion-dollar market with no FDA-approved therapy, and 89bio's FGF21 analog showed positive Phase 1 data in healthy volunteers. That said, it has yet to demonstrate proof-of-concept in NASH patients.</p>
      <p>YayYo (NASDAQ:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/YAYO">YAYO</a>), which operates a fleet management and auto rental platform for ridesharing drivers, raised $11 million to command a $118 million market cap. The company more than tripled sales in the 1H19 while EBITDA swung positive. However, the auto rental industry is highly competitive, and YayYo's relatively small operations didn't bolster investor confidence. The company finished down 10%.</p>
