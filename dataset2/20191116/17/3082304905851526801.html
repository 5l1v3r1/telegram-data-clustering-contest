        <b>Pep Guardiola was behind Xabi Alonso’s decision to leave Real Madrid for Bayern Munich in 2014, the former Spain international has said.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Xabi Alonso has revealed he left Real Madrid for Bayern Munich because he was “curious” to find out Pep Guardiola’s coaching secrets.</p>
      <p>The 37-year-old swapped clubs in 2014 after five seasons at the Santiago Bernabeu, where he won six major trophies.</p>
      <p>Alonso left Madrid three months after helping them to Champions League glory and went on to spend three years with Bayern before announcing his playing retirement.</p>
      <p>Explaining his reasons for wanting to leave the Spanish giants, Alonso told The Athletic: “I was so curious to find out [Guardiola’s] secrets.</p>

      <p>“He has a relentless natural enthusiasm. Football seasons are long but right until the very end, Pep never seemed to be tired.</p>
      <p>“He was alert, always ready. For the players, maybe this gave us an extra few metres in our legs when it mattered most.”</p>
      <p>Alonso, who took over as Real Sociedad B head coach in June, also praised the work of Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp.</p>
      <p>The former Spain international, who played against Klopp’s Borussia Dortmund side during his time at Madrid and Bayern, said: “I didn’t enjoy playing against them because they made it so intense, you’d almost break.</p>
      <p>“It was like he wanted you to be in a cage. He wanted to trap you. There was an organised pressure. I was under pressure all the time.</p>
      <p>“I enjoyed the mood around those games because they were so important but the challenge of beating Dortmund was immense.”</p>
