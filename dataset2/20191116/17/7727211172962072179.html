      <h1>Universal Basic Income could replace Universal Credit</h1>
      <h2>The radical plan for a new system is getting closer</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T17:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/liam-thorp/" target="_blank">Liam Thorp</a></address>
      <p>The ECHO has been running a series of features on the prospect of a new Universal Basic Income being brought in for UK citizens.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/move-replace-universal-credit-basic-17225229">Last week we reported </a>how the idea of radically changing the benefits system in this country to remove the controversial Universal Credit and replace it was a basic income for all are getting closer - and could actually start in Liverpool.</p>
      <p>
        <b>But how much would each person actually get under a UBI system?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A Basic Income, also known as a Universal Basic Income (UBI),<a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/liverpool-close-launching-universal-basic-16382354"> is a regular payment from the state to everyone, </a>regardless of their income or employment status. Proposals for a Basic Income range from £50 per week for every adult to over £100 per week for every adult and child.</p>
      <p>Supporters believe that a Basic Income would guarantee everyone the right to basic financial security by providing a regular income boost for millions in Britain.</p>

      <p>Some suggest a UBI could start with everyone receiving an initial basic income of £2,400 a year for adults - with £1,500 paid to every child.</p>
      <p>The idea would be to eventually double the adult payments to £4,800 per person - which would work out at £400 per month.</p>
      <p>It is thought that extra support payments would then be added on to a basic payment for those with additional needs such as disabilities.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How likely is all this to actually happen?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Well that of course very much depends on what happens in next month's General Election.</p>
      <p>Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has already stated Labour's plans to trial the idea of a Universal Basic Income if his party wins power.</p>
      <p>He has also stated that Liverpool - an area hit hard by benefit cuts and issues - would likely be one of the first cities to be included in the pilot test.</p>

      <p>Earlier this year he said: "I’d like to see a Northern and Midlands town in the pilot so we have a spread."</p>
      <p>“I would like Liverpool – of course I would, I’m a Scouser – but Sheffield have really worked hard. I’ve been involved in their anti-poverty campaign and they’ve done a lot round the real living wage.<br/><br/>"I think those two cities would be ideal and somewhere in the Midlands.”</p>
