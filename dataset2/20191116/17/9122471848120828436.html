      <h1>Alabama Is Off To A Ridiculous Start vs. Mississippi State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T17:26:24+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 17:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>The Alabama Crimson Tide lost their first game of the season last weekend in a battle against rival LSU. Ed Orgeron’s Tigers came out firing and quarterback Joe Burrow threw for nearly 400 yards and three touchdowns en route to a 46-41 win.</p>
      <p>The loss left college football analysts everywhere wondering if this is the first year Alabama won’t be in the College Football Playoff. Nick Saban’s team needs to win-out and win with style points in the process.</p>
      <p>Well, it seems that Alabama got the message. The Crimson Tide are off to an incredible start against Mississippi State so far.</p>
      <p>Just two minutes and six seconds into the first quarter, Alabama jumped out to a 14-0 lead.</p>

      <p>Star quarterback Tua Tagovailoa was questionable heading into this weekend’s game with an ankle injury. However, he got the start under center and it looks like that decision is paying off for Saban and company.</p>
      <p>Tua started the game 3-of-3 passing for 60 yards and a touchdown pass to running back Najee Harris.</p>
      <p>It’s a great start for the Crimson Tide who sit at No. 5 in the latest College Football Playoff rankings. Can the Tide win-out and find a spot in the playoff once again?</p>
      <p>Stay tuned.</p>
