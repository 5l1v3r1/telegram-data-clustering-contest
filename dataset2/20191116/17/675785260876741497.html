      <h2>The England forward caused mayhem against Kosovo in their last encounter and is set to be recalled to the side for the last Euro 2020 qualifying match in Pristina</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T17:46:02+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 17:46</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p>Kosovo's manager Bernard Challandes has joked the only way to stop Raheem Sterling is to break his legs.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/raheem-sterling">Sterling</a> ran riot against the team ranked 114th in FIFA's world rankings when the teams last met in September, scoring once and providing two assists in a man of the match display.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old is set to feature in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/england-football-team">England's</a> last qualifying match for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/euro-2020">Euro 2020</a> , having missed the win over Montenegro due to his part in a row with teammate Joe Gomez.</p>
      <p>Sunday's match in Pristina City is effectively a dead rubber, with England already through, and Kosovo not able to qualify, but Challandes is still determined to keep Sterling under wraps.</p>
      <p>"If we remember the first game in England, with so much space, it's impossible to stop him," Challandes said at a press conference. "Because what he has done in this match is 461 metres (distance covered) with high intensity."</p>

      <p>After comparing Sterling to players of Kosovo's last opponents Czech Republic, he added: "It's incredible. Only as a team we can find a not so bad solution [to stop him]. Or we break his legs, but we are too nice."</p>
      <p>Sterling will be hopeful of a repeat performance against the European minnows, not least to put the episode with Gomez behind him.</p>

      <p>Gareth Southgate decided to make Sterling unavailable for the Montenegro clash after he was embroiled in an argument with Gomez in the canteen at England's St.Georges Park training base on Monday.</p>
      <p>Gomez has since withdrawn from the squad for the clash with Kosovo over a knee injury picked up in training, which follows him being booed by his own fans against Montenegro.</p>
      <p>Sterling defended his teammate after the match, posting on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> : "To all the England fans, I wanted to leave things at it was but tonight I have to speak again: it was hard for me to see my team mate get booed for something that was my fault.</p>
      <p>"Joe hasn’t done anything wrong &amp; for me to see someone who keeps his head down and work hard..especially after a difficult week for him to be booed when he came on tonight was wrong.</p>
      <p>"I’ve taken full responsibility and accepted the consequence. I felt as though I had to say this get home safe every one."</p>
