        <b>Liverpool will continue their Premier League title charge at Crystal Palace, and Sadio Mane has saluted Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sadio Mane is enjoying the “easy” life with title hopefuls Liverpool because of the quality possessed by Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino.</p>
      <p>The Senegal star is Liverpool’s leading Premier League scorer this season with seven goals and he has so far edged out his fellow Reds forwards in overall performance.</p>
      <p>Statistics from Opta show Mane has played 21 key passes, compared to 14 from both Salah and Firmino, and his accuracy in finding team-mates across the whole pitch is also superior.</p>
      <p>He has also won a greater number of tackles – Mane with 14, Firmino seven and Salah three – and made more interceptions (9-1-1).</p>
      <p>But Mane says he is coping with the workload for the title front-runners thanks to considerable effort from Brazilian Firmino and Egyptian Salah.</p>
      <p>“I always say it is very easy to work together,” Mane told the official Liverpool FC magazine. “Personally, I just think myself very lucky to play alongside these great players.</p>
      <p>“Every single player who plays alongside them would enjoy it because they are very good players and they make everything easy, so I just enjoy playing alongside them.”</p>
      <p>Mane believes the global language of football allows for fluency between Jurgen Klopp’s prolific attackers.</p>
      <p>“We are all from different countries and speak different first languages but I think football is one language and it is universal so everybody can speak it. It is the same with Mo, Bobby and myself,” he added.</p>
      <p>Liverpool face Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park next Saturday in their next Premier League assignment, before taking on Napoli in the Champions League on the following Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The club have announced the death of a player who captained Liverpool in the old Second Division in the 1958-59 season.</p>
      <p>Johnny Wheeler died at the age of 91, Liverpool said. The midfielder made 177 appearances for the club and also played for Tranmere and Bolton, winning one England cap.</p>
