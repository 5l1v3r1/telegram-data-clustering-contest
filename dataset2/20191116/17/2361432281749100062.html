      <p>Former DNC Chair Donna Brazile did not mince words when it came to Roger Stone’s conviction during her appearance on “Real Time With Bill Maher” Friday night, saying that she hopes Donald Trump’s friend “roasts in hell.”</p>
      <p>Brazile made the fiery comments on the show’s “Overtime” post-show on YouTube when Maher asked his panel whether they think Trump will grant Stone a presidential pardon. <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/roger-stone-found-guilty-on-all-7-counts-in-obstruction-case-stemming-from-mueller-probe/">Stone was found guilty</a> on Friday on seven federal criminal charges, including witness tampering and obstruction of justice, and could face up to 20 years in prison.</p>
      <p>“Well, he’s going to be sentenced February 6th — I hope he roasts in hell, that son of a bitch,” Brazile said, to which Maher jokingly told her to calm down.</p>

      <p>“[Stone] worked with WikiLeaks to destroy not just Democrats, but to destroy our democracy, so I hope he roasts in hell, and I wish I’m at the sentencing hearing cuz I’m going to wear the best looking red dress I could and say go to hell. Not jail,” she continued.</p>
      <p>Brazile, who became chair of the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 election and has been a <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/former-dnc-chair-donna-brazile-joins-fox-news-as-a-contributor/">contributor at Fox News</a> since March 2019, accused Stone and WikiLeaks of working to “destroy Hillary Clinton.”</p>

      <p>“I have a lot of love, I’m going to have to work really hard I’m forgiving him,” Brazile said, but added that “they threatened us they went after us and he understood what was at stake, and you saw the testimony said, they were gleeful. Screw them, bunch of bastards. They were gleeful.”</p>
