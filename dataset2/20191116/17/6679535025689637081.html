      <h1>Murasoli land issue: National Commission for Scheduled Castes summons Udhayanidhi Stalin to Delhi</h1>
      <h2>DMK youth wing leader will have to clarify on Murasoli issue</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T17:25:26+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 17:25</time> by <a rel="author">Special Correspondent</a></address>
      <p>The National Commission for Scheduled Castes has directed DMK youth wing secretary Udhayanidhi Stalin to appear before it on November 20, in connection with the complaint that the office of <i>Murasoli</i>, the party organ, has been constructed on <i>panchami</i> land.</p>
      <p>Besides Mr. Udhayanidhi Stalin, who is the managing director of <i>Murasoli</i>, the Chief Secretary of Tamil Nadu has been asked to appear for a hearing to be held by L. Murugan, vice-chairman of the panel.</p>
      <p>DMK organising secretary and Rajya Sabha member R.S. Bharathi said he along with advocates would appear before the commission.</p>
      <p>Mr. Bharathi vowed to “unmask” those who had levelled allegations about the <i>Murasoli</i> office standing on <i>panchami</i> land. “Our MD has delegated the attendance to us, so we will be presenting the true facts in front of the commission,” he told <i>The Hindu</i>.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>In a statement, he added that party president M.K. Stalin too had directed him to appear before the commission, in his capacity as one of the trustees of <i>Murasoli,</i> at Shastri Bhavan on November 19.</p>
      <p>He said while the BJP government at the Centre never bothered to investigate the distribution of ₹89 crore in the byelection to the R.K. Nagar Assembly constituency, the seizure of ₹560 crore from a container, the raids on the Chief Secretary’s residence and documents seized in connection with the gutka scam from the residence of the health minister, it had shown undue haste in probing a complaint filed by a BJP leader against <i>Murasoli</i>.</p>
      <p>Mr. Bharathi said the allegation was levelled against the DMK during the campaign for the bypoll to the Vikravandi constituency and Mr. Stalin had vowed to furnish appropriate proof and documents.</p>
