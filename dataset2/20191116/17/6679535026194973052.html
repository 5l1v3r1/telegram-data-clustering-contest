      <h1>MSLTA Pune Challenger | Duckworth passes the Ramkumar test</h1>
      <h2>The Indian, however, books a berth in the doubles final in the company of Purav</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T17:18:37+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 17:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Nandakumar-Marar-1197/" target="_blank">Nandakumar Marar</a></address>
      <p>James Duckworth, the second seed, staked a claim for the title in impressive fashion, getting past sixth seed Ramkumar Ramanathan 7-6(8), 6-2 in the semifinal of the KPIT MSLTA Pune Challenger tennis tournament at the MSLTA School of Tennis courts, Balewadi sports complex, here on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Ramkumar, however, clinched a berth in the doubles final in the company of Purav Raja. The two will meet another Indian pair of Saketh Myneni and Arjun Kadhe.</p>
      <h3>Adjusting quickly</h3>
      <p>Competing for the first time on the faster hard courts, Duckworth quickly adjusted to the conditions and was rewarded with a summit clash against fifth-seeded Jay Clark.</p>
      <p>Duckworth, who had overcome Sasi Kumar Mukund in a tough quarterfinal, was well-equipped to handle the weapons in Ramkumar’s armoury. “I watched his matches before and knew about the big serve and volley,” revealed the Australian.</p>
      <p>Duckworth dropped serve at the start, broke back in the sixth to make it 3-3 and came into his own in the tie-breaker. His touch-play was effective and his volleying stood out as he repeatedly passed Ramkumar.</p>
      <h3>Shining in patches</h3>
      <p>Though Ramkumar shone in patches during the first set, with aces and solid passing shots, he was not able to repeat the ruthless serve-and-volleying game which had doused Sumit Nagal’s fightback in the quarterfinals.</p>
      <p>In the other semifinal, Clark faced little resistance from Spaniard Roberto Ortega Olmedo, losing just five games in all. However, given the form Duckworth is in, the Brit has a big task on his hands.</p>
      <p><b>The results (semifinals): </b>Jay Clark (GBr) bt Roberto Ortega Olmedo (Esp) 6-3, 6-2; James Duckworth (Aus) bt Ramkumar Ramanathan 7-6(8), 6-2.</p>
      <p><b>Doubles:</b> Arjun Kadhe &amp; Saketh Myneni bt Vishnu Vardhan &amp; Toshide Matsui (Jpn) 5-7, 7-6(1), 10-4; Purav Raja &amp; Ramkumar Ramanathan bt Brydan Klein &amp; Vijay Sundar Prashanth 6-4, 7-5.</p>
