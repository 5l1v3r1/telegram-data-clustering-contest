      <h1>NRA gives chief Wayne LaPierre 57% pay raise amid calls to step down</h1>

      <p>Wayne LaPierre, the embattled chief executive of the National Rifle Association, banked a 57 percent pay hike last year — amid the din of calls for him to retire, a report said.</p>
      <p>The nonprofit group’s latest tax filings show LaPierre received a base salary of $1.3 million, plus a bonus of $455,000 and “other reportable compensation” of more than $427,000, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/nra-chief-wayne-lapierre-received-a-57-percent-pay-raise-in-2018-tax-filings-show/2019/11/15/dba9ef54-07cf-11ea-b388-434b5c1d7dd8_story.html">The Washington Post reported</a> Friday.</p>
      <p>La­Pierre, 70, also received an additional $73,793 in “retirement and other deferred compensation” and “nontaxable benefits” from the NRA and related entities, according to the filings.</p>
      <p>LaPierre’s pay increase was revealed at a time when the gun-rights group is facing increased scrutiny for a variety of financial dealings, including accusations it made unapproved payments of over a half-million dollars <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/12/nra-reportedly-made-unapproved-big-money-deals-with-celebrity-board-members/">to celebrity board members Tom Selleck and Ted Nugent</a>.</p>
      <p>The New York Department of Financial Services is investigating the NRA <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/08/09/new-york-regulators-probing-nra-for-illegal-gun-insurance-kickbacks-sources/">for its role in offering now-banned insurance products for gun owners in the state</a> — and earning at least $14 million in the process.</p>
      <p>In addition, the group is in a legal dispute with its former president, Oliver North, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/04/27/oliver-north-will-not-serve-a-second-term-as-nra-president/">who stepped down in April</a> amid a financial scandal that led to its break with a longtime public relations firm, Ackerman McQueen, which operated NRATV.</p>
      <p>The organization is also under pressure to explain large payments to top executives, even as it has cut spending on firearms training and political activities and frozen pension benefits for employees.</p>
