      <p>Glossop North End 4 Chasetown 3</p>
      <p>Chasetown made a catastrophic start after 6 minutes. A shot from Porya Ahmadi seemed straight forward for keeper Curtis Pond but somehow crept into the bottom corner</p>
      <p>Five minutes later it was 2-0. Glossop opened up the visitors defence and Bevan Burey fired a right footer inside Pond's right hand post.</p>
      <p>Braulio Maeico had a great chance to increase Glossop's advantage. He went round Pond, only for Will Whieldon to retreat and clear the danger.</p>
      <p>Chasetown had one shot blocked and then were a whisker away from a way back into the game as Scott Kay almost headed into his own goal, ending up conceding a corner.</p>
      <p>The hosts made it 3-0 five minutes into the second half. A Chasetown defender played the ball right into the path of Ahmadi who expertly lobbed Pond</p>
      <p>Chasetown got one back with their best move of the game. George Cater slid the ball through to Liam Kirton who picked out substitute Kieran Brown who fired home from 6 yards.</p>
      <p>Glossop extended their lead in the 83rd minute. A Scholars move broke down in midfield and North End moved the ball quickly and Mohammed Sheriff netted with his right foot.</p>
      <p>Chasetown were awarded a spot kick when Kieran Brown was fouled and Jack Langston converted to the keeper's left.</p>
      <p>Dramatically, Chasetown got another goal back in the 88th minute. Cater raced onto a through ball and lobbed keeper Dale Latham with an exquisite finish.</p>
