        <b>Leinster began their quest for a record-breaking fifth Champions Cup title off to the best possible start as they swatted away a stubborn and brave Benetton side at the RDS to emerge with a bonus-point victory.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A first-half brace from Garry Ringrose, which came on either side of a Dean Budd try, got the eastern province up and running but it wasn’t until Rónan Kelleher’s effort on the half-hour mark when Leinster could finally put a bit of daylight between themselves and the Italian side.</p>
      <p>Kieran Crowley’s men are well drilled and it showed as they continued to make ground in the Leinster half but often, a lack of patience in conjunction with some excellent defence from Leo Cullen’s men thwarted their efforts at every turn.</p>
      <p>Johnny Sexton finished off a lovely move to wrap up the bonus-point at the beginning of the second half but the visitors failed to wilt as so many other sides have done in this position.</p>
      <p>They scored through Hame Faiva to reduce the deficit to just 12 points before the eastern province finally put the game to bed as the excellent Ringrose completed his hattrick.</p>
      <p>Ringrose began this game like a steam train. He made 39 metres off just seven carries in his first-half performance alone and it only took him five minutes to cross the whitewash. The home side nicely built pressure close to the Benetton line before some simple but effective interplay between Andrew Porter and Johnny Sexton saw Ringrose glide through a gap for the game’s opening score.</p>
      <p>Sexton was wide with his difficult touchline conversion attempt and they would rue that miss for a brief period at least because the Italian side responded immediately with a try of their own.</p>

      <p>A penalty conceded by Leinster was kicked to the corner and after a number of close-range carries, Dean Budd somehow positioned his body to clamber over the ruck to touch down.</p>
      <p>Ian Keatley slotted the difficult conversion to perfection to give his side a narrow two-point lead which didn’t last for long.</p>
      <p>Six minutes later, a series of dominant mauls were causing the visitors all sorts of problems and with the go-forward ball generated deep in the Benetton 22, Ringrose once again showed his superb awareness to identify a sliver of space to target.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old was almost stopped in his tracks by Alberto Sgarbi and Keatley but he showed enough strength to get over close to the posts.</p>

      <p>The eastern province suffered some disruption when Caelan Doris departed the fray for a Head Injury Assessment. Max Deegan replaced the youngster which would turn out to be a permanent switch.</p>
      <p>Benetton responded with a period of pressure close to the Leinster line only for Devin Toner to conjure up a bit of magic in the lineout as he claimed the ball to offset a dangerous situation for the home side.</p>
      <p>Crowley’s men would rue coming away with nothing from that period of territory. They soon found themselves on the back foot as a high tackle by Nicola Quaglio on Rónan Kelleher saw the loosehead sent to the sin-bin.</p>
      <p>The eastern province scored off the next possession when Kelleher cruised over from close-range to cap a memorable European debut and what was his seventh try in just six games.</p>
      <p>Leinster wrapped up the bonus-point less than five minutes into the second-half when Sexton sparked a superb move which saw him break through the Benetton defence before offloading to the supporting Josh van der Flier.</p>

      <p>The flanker then powered through a tackle attempt from Angelo Esposito before laying off the final pass to Sexton who scored under the posts – a try which he converted himself.</p>
      <p>It’s a sign of the progress Benetton have made in recent years that they were able to respond with another try of their own. This time, a powerful lineout maul was illegally pulled down but with the penalty advantage, Hame Faiva was able to peel away and power over for his side’s second try.</p>
      <p>Keatley converted to put 12 points between the sides.</p>
      <p>Despite further sustained periods of possession in the Leinster 22, Benetton couldn’t make it count on the scoreboard thanks to some excellent defending from the home side.</p>
      <p>As Leinster so often do, they punish sides who don’t take their opportunities against them. With just over 10 minutes remaining, Ringrose completed his hattrick which guaranteed the result for the eastern province after Benetton continued to threaten.</p>
      <p>With the game in its dying moments Luca Sperandio scored in the corner for his side’s third try. That score gave the Italian side a glimmer that they could salvage two points from this game if they managed another try but they weren’t able to do so as they leave Dublin with nothing to show despite an impressive display.</p>
