      <p>District Collector P.B. Noohu visited the base camps of Nilackal and Pampa to take stock of the situation there on Friday.</p>
      <p>The TDB has provided pilgrim shelters that can accommodate 9,000 people at Nilackal, besides providing 1,090 toilets, 60 bathrooms, and an Annadana Mandapam there, according to Devaswom Minister Kadakampally Surendran. He said parking facility for 9,000 vehicles has been provided at Nilackal and parking lots for another 2,000 vehicles are getting ready at the base camp.</p>
      <h3>Incinerators</h3>
      <p>The TDB environment wing has completed the repair and maintenance of the incinerators at Nilackal, Pampa and Sabarimala. The maintenance of the sewage treatment plants at Pampa and the Sannidhanam has been carried out.</p>
      <p>Devaswom executive officer Rajendra Prasad told <i>The Hindu </i>that the board has kept a buffer stock of 21 lakh cans (250 ml each) of Aravana and three packets of Appam as on Friday afternoon.</p>
