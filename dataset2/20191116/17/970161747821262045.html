      <p>Jenny Jinya brought us the <a href="https://9gag.com/gag/aroMbRy/the-complete-comic-good-boy-by-jenny-jinya">‘Good Boy’ comic</a> that pretty much wrecked our lives.</p>
      <p>In it, a puppy who’s been abandoned by the side of the road is visited by death, saying it’s his time to go.</p>
      <p>He asks death if he’s been a bad boy and that was why he was left alone, and death decides all the love the little pup has to give shouldn’t go to waste.</p>
      <p>So, when a person in hospital passes away, death makes sure that the dog is the first thing they see, making their transition a little easier and giving the dog people who he can love and be loved by.</p>
      <p>If you thought that was heartbreaking, though, you’re going to be absolutely devastated by the recent comic Jinya has released.</p>
      <p>Death is back again, but this time the topic is black cats. Take a look.</p>

      <p>Yup, straight in the feels. We did warn you.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Not going to lie, though, we didn’t expect to feel such an affinity with a skeleton who brings death to cute animals.</p>
      <p>It’s not just about making us all cry, though. Jinya is using the comic to highlight how black cats are discriminated against, and can face cruelty and neglect as a result of superstitions.</p>
      <p>In an Instagram post of the comic, she said: ‘Even in 2019, you still hear of black cats being associated with superstitions, witches, black magic and such.</p>
      <p>‘Black shelter pets are less likely to be adopted than pets of other colors. They still face so much hate nowadays and the more I read about this topic, the sadder I get.’</p>
      <p>It’s true. <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/10/27/heres-why-we-celebrate-national-black-cat-day-8080784/">The RSPCA say that black cats are the hardest to find homes for</a>.</p>
      <p>Instagram allegedly plays a role too, with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/05/22/photographer-takes-stunning-portraits-black-cats-dogs-get-adopted-9637307/">photographer Emma O’Brien finding that some people didn’t want black cats or dogs because they believed they wouldn’t photograph as well</a> for their social media.</p>
      <p>At least we’re crying our eyes out for a good cause.</p>
      <p>Another warning, though. Jenny Jinya teased a sequel to this comic just yesterday, so don’t put the tissues away just yet.</p>
