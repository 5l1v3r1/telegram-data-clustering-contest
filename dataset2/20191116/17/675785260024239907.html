      <h1>Inside Ant McPartlin and Lisa Armstrong's bitter divorce and why she wants her day in court</h1>
      <h2>Lisa Armstrong is waiting for her day in court as she declines offers of a financial settlement from Ant McPartlin, it's claimed</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T17:20:22+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 17:20</time> by <a rel="author">Molly Pike, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/molly-pike/</a></address>
      <p>Ant McPartlin and Lisa Armstrong split up almost two years ago but their divorce still hasn't gone through.</p>
      <p>The makeup artist, who works on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> , is reportedly waiting for her day in court as she declines offers of a financial settlement.</p>
      <p>A friend of Lisa's told the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7691361/As-Im-Celeb-kicks-real-contest-Ants-battle-ex-Lisa-ALISON-BOSHOFF-writes.html">Daily Mail</a> : "It is not about the money, she is not a materialistic person. It is all about his appalling behaviour to her."</p>
      <p>Lisa and Ant were together for 23 years and married in 2006 before announcing their separation in 2018.</p>
      <p>Ant soon started a new relationship with her friend and former personal assistant Anne-Marie Corbett.</p>

      <p>Lisa was left reeling when the couple went public and took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> to blast Anne-Marie for breaking the 'Girl Code'.</p>
      <p>Ant has reportedly made his ex a very generous offer of around half of his £63 million fortune.</p>
      <p>But Lisa is standing firm, with the source adding: "She doesn’t need to settle, she can be a thorn in his side. She knows she is a stronger person than him. He lives in dread of seeing her in the corridor of a TV studio one day, but she would relish it."</p>

      <p>Another point of contention in the divorce talks is her rumoured refusal to sign a non-disclosure agreement which means she won't be able to talk about their relationship.</p>
      <p>Friends say she has no intention of doing a tell all book, but doesn't want to sign the NDA out of principle.</p>
      <p>They added: "She has always been discreet about him to the point where people will often have their make-up done by her and not be aware of the connection. The point is that she just doesn’t want to give him the power over her."</p>

      <p>After a hellish year of two stints in rehab, a public battle with prescription drugs and booze, and his shameful drink-driving crash in March 2018, Ant is no doubt hoping the public will continue to support him.</p>
      <p>But without Lisa agreeing to sign the NDA, he's reportedly not signing off on a financial settlement until she complies.</p>
      <p>The warring exes have also been butting heads over custody of their Labrador Hurley.</p>
