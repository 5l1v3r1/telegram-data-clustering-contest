      <h1>Young Derbyshire woman 'struggling to cope' after suicides of her brother and sister</h1>
      <h2>They were aged 21 and 24</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T17:59:37+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 17:59</time> by <a rel="author">Noah Martin</a></address>
      <p>A heartbroken Derbyshire woman who lost her sister and brother to suicide has revealed how she has been "existing, not living".</p>
      <p>Bethany Palmer, 26, lost the two siblings in the space of just two years.</p>
      <p>Now, the mum-of-three has talked candidly about her grief in the hope it will encourage others to never give up on life.</p>
      <p>Recalling the double-tragedy, Bethany said her brother Joseph was aged 24 when he hanged himself in an outhouse at her property, where he had been staying in 2017.</p>
      <p>Only two years before that, her 21-year-old sister, Sophia, had also taken her own life.</p>
      <p>Bethany, who lives in Ilkeston, said: "It is always there, for years I've been existing, not living. It's like someone just took my life, threw it up in the air, and it's scattered everywhere.</p>
      <p>"But now is the time to turn it into something positive instead of letting it have a hold over me."</p>

      <p>On the evening that Joe died, Bethany said there was a "sense of calmness" in her house.</p>
      <p>"The house had been stressful leading up to it, but on the night everything was peaceful. The children were peaceful.</p>
      <p>"I was clearing away pots, we'd had homemade lasagne and Joe was out in the shed because that was his chill-out space."</p>
      <p>Bethany said "something kept her inside" and it wasn't until she got suspicious an hour later she went to find Joe - but it was too late.</p>
      <p>"From that night I felt empty,” she said. “I felt like I was just stuck in this moment and the whole world was just carrying on.</p>
      <p>"I kept reliving the experience over and over again. I kept seeing his face as I was opening the shed door. It was dark and I had a torch.</p>
      <p>"I can still see it now, my torch light slowly going through the shed and shining onto him."</p>
      <p>After Joe's death, Bethany said she became "depressed", struggled to get out of the house and couldn't hold down a job.</p>
      <p>Bethany said: "With my sister Sophia, I suppose you could say we saw it coming, she was really unwell and had been sectioned because she was suicidal.</p>
      <p>"But with Joe, we thought because he knew how it felt and the effect it had the first time round, he wouldn't have gone through with it."</p>
      <p>Haunted by flashbacks to the night that Joe died, Bethany said "even now" if she is struggling to sleep, she can "still see his face".</p>
      <p>"Even letting the dogs out to the back garden, I just take a deep breath and it's like I'm there again, in the crisp cold air."</p>
      <p>She added: "After Sophia we all just drifted, we did it without realising.</p>
      <p>"We were close as siblings and I think we were scared to lose another, so if we drew away we wouldn't have that close bond."</p>
      <p>As well as her siblings, Bethany said the suicides have had a "massive impact" on her three children - AJ, 10, Zachary, eight, and three-year-old Phoebe.</p>

      <p>"They have seen a lot, you try to protect them from it but police have been at the door, they were still awake when my brother happened.</p>
      <p>"We told them he was in a motorbike accident but they listened to conversations, they aren't stupid.”</p>
      <p>Bethany said little Phoebe was "really close" to her uncle and they would often spend an evening curled up on the sofa, chatting.</p>
      <p>However, she only realised the true extent of the impact when her oldest child started saying he "would kill himself" when he was angry or upset.</p>
      <p>"It made me realise the full extent of what it’s teaching the younger generations, that suicide is the answer and it’s not the answer.”</p>
      <p>There were a total of seven siblings in her family before the tragic losses but Bethany said the suicides have drawn them apart.</p>
      <p>Despite the consequences for her family, Bethany said she doesn't feel angry about what happened, only a sense of guilt. A month before he died, Joe had made an attempt on his life in the outhouse but Bethany had managed to stop him.</p>
      <p>"We didn’t speak about it again and I think that was me being too scared to talk about it, bringing too much back from my sister, but I should've done more," she said.</p>

      <p>Bethany said she is only just starting the process of putting her life back together and is "slowly starting to make steps forward".</p>
      <p>"I'd like people to, whenever they are feeling like that, even if they are completely done, to just hold on.</p>
      <p>"If you think you're in debt or anything like that, and you think that's you're only escape, it isn't, I don't think anyone truly wants to end their life, they just want an escape."</p>
      <p>Bethany said she wants people to "reach out more" but cited a lack of support once people are discharged from crisis teams as a problem.</p>
      <p>"I've got a few ideas about what I want to do around mental health and helping others, it's just about putting those into action.”</p>
