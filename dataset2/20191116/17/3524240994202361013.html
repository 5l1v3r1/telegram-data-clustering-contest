      <p>Sporadic violence marred polls in two key Nigerian states Saturday, despite a heavy security presence after a bloody run-up to the elections.</p>
      <p>Bayelsa and central Kogi are among the seven states where governorship elections are held at different times from the general election due to court rulings.</p>
      <p>Bayelsa has been ruled by the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party since Nigeria returned to civilian rule in 1999.</p>
      <p>Counting began on Saturday evening.</p>
      <p>Election officials said results had been trickling in, but voting would continue in areas where there had been stray violence.</p>
      <p>In Bayelsa, the election was cancelled in some stations in the Ogbia area following the abduction of an election official and the burning of voting materials.</p>
      <p>Voting opened late in most polling stations in the state, with long queues forming in Yenagoa, the state capital, and elsewhere.</p>
      <p>In Otuoke, the hometown of former president Goodluck Jonathan, party thugs fought over the late arrival and distribution of voting materials.</p>
      <p>Many people were injured in the fracas.</p>

      <p>The polls officially closed at 2:00 pm (1300 GMT), but electoral officials said those who had already queued up would be allowed to vote even after the deadline.</p>
      <p>Some 900,000 voters are eligible to vote for the candidates of 45 political parties in 1,804 polling stations across Bayelsa.</p>
      <p>The leading candidates are David Lyon of ruling All Progressive Congress and PDP’s Douye Diri, a former senator.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The winner of the election will replace PDP’ Governor Seriake Dickson, who is stepping down after two four-year terms, the legal maximum.</p>
      <p>The Independent National Electoral Commission said over 31,000 policemen had been deployed in Bayelsa, as well as 87 gunboats, to prevent violence.</p>
      <p><b>Helicopters, soldiers, riot police</b><br/>Police helicopters hovered over Yenagoa, while soldiers and anti-riot police mounted roadblocks at major points, an AFP reporter said.</p>
      <p>This week, a staffer at a radio station was shot dead and many injured during an attack on a political rally in Bayelsa; and in Kogi state, a campaign office was burnt down.</p>
      <p>“Already there have been several instances of violence at election campaign rallies in both Bayelsa and Kogi states,” Amnesty International said.</p>
      <p>Voters on Saturday said they wanted a peaceful election.</p>
      <p>“We crave a free, fair and hitch-free elections in Bayelsa. Everybody should be allowed to exercise his or her franchise without harassment and intimidation,” Joseph Cookey, a textile trader in the southern city of Port Harcourt, told AFP.</p>
      <p>Housewife Alice Ebere urged “politicians to shun violence and allow the wish of people to prevail”.</p>
      <p>In Kogi where incumbent Governor Yahaya Bello of APC is seeking re-election against Musa Wada of PDP and 22 other candidates, a boy was shot in the leg when a group of people stormed into a polling unit and snatched ballot boxes.</p>
      <p>Local reports also said some party agents were beaten up at another polling booth in the state.</p>
      <p>In Kogi, a total 35,200 police had been deployed to protect some 1.5 million registered voters, according to INEC.</p>
      <p>Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation with 190 million people, has a long history of electoral violence, vote-buying, ballot-stuffing and voter intimidation.</p>
      <p>Dozens of people were killed during the 2019 general election which returned President Muhammadu Buhari to power.</p>
      <p>In 2011, hundreds of people were killed in post-election violence, mostly in northern Nigeria.</p>
      <p>Buhari, the 76-year-old General who headed a military regime in the 1980s, has promised to reform the country’s electoral system to ensure free, fair and credible elections.</p>
