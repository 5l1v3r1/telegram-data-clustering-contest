        <li>I recently flew Alitalia from New York’s JFK Airport to Rome in business class after I scored an incredible deal, and managed to stack two different discounts on the flight.</li>
        <li>I was impressed by the onboard food and drinks, and the comfort of the cabin on the Boeing 777-200 – the airline has a fun Italian flair that lends itself to a great experience.</li>
        <li>There were a few minor flaws, like a poor in-flight entertainment system, but I would absolutely choose the airline’s business class again, if I get the chance.</li>

      <p>Business class is obviously the ideal way to fly, but for most of us, it’s completely unaffordable.</p>
      <p>However, sometimes, you’ll get lucky and manage to snag a great deal that makes a flight only a little more expensive than coach (or you can get a seat <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/all-nippon-airways-first-class-review-2019-4">for free or cheap by using frequent flyer miles</a>).</p>
      <p>By using Google flights and searching multiple dates, nearby airports, or routes, you might be able to stumble on a deal. There are also a handful of blogs and services that highlight the best premium cabin sales, including a new <a href="https://dollarflightclub.com/premium-plus/">Premium Plus subscription</a> service from Dollar Flight Club.</p>
      <p>I went to Europe for vacation this fall, and started in Germany. When I was looking for flights, I serendipitously learned about an unannounced sale on Delta and its partners that brought business class tickets between New York and Berlin below $US1,900.</p>
      <p>Plus, because I have an <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/signs-amex-platinum-better-for-you-than-chase-sapphire-reserve-2019-10">Amex Platinum credit card</a>, I could save a few hundred more by booking through Amex’s <a href="https://consumer-travel.americanexpress.com/international-airline-program">International Airline Program</a>, a benefit that offers discounts on premium tickets with certain airlines.</p>
      <p>While that was still more than I would normally spend, I decided to go for it because of one other benefit: I was close to requalifying for my frequent flyer status with Delta, and by flying in business class, I’d earn 50% more qualifying miles on the flight. The value I’ll get from the status benefits made it worth spending a bit more up front for this flight.</p>
      <p>I booked my outbound flight on Italian airline Alitalia. Although the airline has been on the brink of bankruptcy for a long time, and is still in a tenuous financial situation, I’d heard good things about the on-board experience in both business class and economy.</p>
      <p>My flight from New York left at around 5:00 p.m., and I’m happy to say that the experience lived up to the airline’s reputation.</p>
      <p>Keep on reading to see what it was like.</p>

      <h3>Alitalia flies from Terminal 1 at JFK, which often feels like a “catch-all” terminal.</h3>

      <p>Premium cabins are important for airlines’ bottom lines. You can score the tickets for relatively little during flash sales or by using miles, but most of the seats are sold to business travellers and high-earning leisure travellers for full price, offering airlines dramatically higher margins than coach seats.</p>
      <p>It’s important for airlines to get the business-class experience right (and first-class, if they offer it), to attract clients.</p>
      <p>Alitalia was a fun, great experience. The food on board was fantastic, and the airline felt representative of its home market, rather than being fairly generic. And, most importantly, the seat and bed were comfortable.</p>
      <p>The food in the lounge was sub-par, but I really didn’t mind as I saved room for dinner onboard.</p>
      <p>I would also caution anyone flying the airline to bring their own entertainment, as I found the inflight system clunky, and it had a relatively poor selection.</p>
      <p>Despite those small issues, and its extensive financial difficulties, I felt the airline did a good job, and I wouldn’t hesitate to fly it again.</p>
