      <p>11-year-old Yashepheh Alofa- Waqanivalu  has made history by being the first child to represent Fiji at the Human Rights Council in the United Nations Office in Geneva.</p>
      <p>She was an intern at the Permanent Mission of Fiji to the United Nations in Geneva for a day and demonstrated herself to be a true leader of tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Waqanivalu expressed enthusiasm and interest in the importance of the work of the Mission, taking her internship opportunity to meet with Ambassador Nazhat Shameem Khan and her team at the Permanent Mission of Fiji to the United Nations in Geneva.</p>
      <p>During her internship she prepared a report of her observations and they were profound.</p>
      <p>This year being the 30th anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the making of history through Waqanivalu's representation of Fiji at the Human Rights Council is only fitting at the time when Fiji is a Member of the Council and also at the helm as its Vice Presidency.</p>
      <p>The Mission has wished Waqanivalu well and congratulates her on her achievement.</p>
