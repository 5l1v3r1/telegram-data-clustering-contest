      <h1>Guardiola keeps an eye on Leicester's reliable left-back!</h1>

        <b>Leicester are the team in the Premier League who have conceded the fewest goals and this hasn't gone unnoticed by Manchester City coach, Pep Guardiola. The Santpedor man has paid special attention to the Evans-Söyüncü duo, which Rodgers uses as a centre pair in every match.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/leicester-city-fc/">Leicester</a> are currently second place in the <b>Premier League</b>, ahead of Manchester City and eight points behind the leaders, Liverpool.<b> These are fascinating, and exciting, figures.</b></p>
      <p>The 'Foxes' have<b> scored 29 goals</b> and are only beaten by <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/manchester-city-fc/">Manchester City</a>, who have <b>scored 35,</b> but they have <b>only conceded eight</b>. They are the team who have <b>conceded the least goals this season</b>, less than <b>Sheffield United (9) or Liverpool (10).</b></p>
      <p>This solid defence is partly the responsibility of a great keeper like <b>Kasper Schmeichel</b>, but it also depends on the <b>centre-backs.</b></p>

      <p>And it is the Northern Irish <b>Jonny Evans </b>and the Turkish<b> Caglar Soyuncu </b>who are causing a stir in the Premier League. The mix between old and young<b> (31-years-old and 23)</b> is working well.</p>
      <p>The thing is that according to 'Fichajes.com', <b>City, at Guardiola's request</b>, would be following them both closely. Because the defensive line has been the Achilles heel of<b> Guardiola's City</b> from day one, despite the <b>millions of investments </b>made in people like <b>Stones, Laporte or Otamendi.</b></p>
