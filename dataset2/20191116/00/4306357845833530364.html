      <h3>Liverpool FC are interested in signing midfielder Sander Berge, according to Genk sporting director Dimitri De Conde.</h3>
      <p>The Belgian club’s representative has claimed that Liverpool FC and Napoli are both keeping a close eye on the Norway international in the lead-up to the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>According to De Conde, Liverpool FC have stepped up their interest in the 21-year-old since the Champions League clash between the two sides at Anfield back at the start of the month.</p>
      <p>He also suggests that Napoli are ready to rival the Merseyside outfit for the signature of the midfielder as the countdown to the January transfer window continues.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview quoted by <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/liverpool-and-napoli-interested-in-berge-says-genk-sporting/2ay253o2x9911b99pi3a55x7h">Goal</a>, De Conde said: “Napoli are interested in Sander, it’s a possibility a deal could be done.</p>
      <p>“We also know that Liverpool are interested and [Jurgen] Klopp, after the game at Anfield [in the Champions League], complimented him on his performance.</p>
      <p>“There are clubs in Italy who are following Berge and Napoli could be one of them, but at this stage there are no offers on the table. From next week, things could change.</p>
      <p>“We haven’t had any official contact with Napoli yet.”</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old midfielder has been in solid form for Genk this season and has scored two goals in 15 league games so far this term.</p>
      <p>He has also made four Champions League appearances for the Belgian side, including the two defeats by Liverpool FC in the group stage.</p>
      <p>Liverpool FC are currently flying high at the top of the Premier League table after having won all but one of their opening 12 games.</p>
      <p>The Reds will return to action with a trip to Crystal Palace after the international break.</p>
