      <h3>Bello Speaks After Casting His Vote</h3>
      <p><b>Governor Yahaya Bello</b> who is also the candidate of the <b><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/apc/"><u>All Progressives Congress</u></a></b> (APC) in the Kogi State gubernatorial election has cast his vote.</p>
      <p>As earlier reported by <b>Naija News</b>, Gov. Bello <b><a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/16/kogi-decides-governor-yahaya-bello-cast-his-vote/"><u>cast his vote</u></a></b> around 8:45am on Saturday alongside his wife <b>Hajia Amina Bello</b> at Agasa ward 1.</p>
      <p>Addressing newsmen shortly after voting, Governor Bello was full of praises for the organizational ability of the <b>Independent National Electoral Commission</b> (INEC).</p>
      <p>He commended INEC for ensuring the card readers are functioning properly unlike during the presidential election when he noted the card reader failed in his polling unit.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the possible outcome of the election, the Governor expressed confidence that the polls will continue peacefully.</p>
      <p>He further expressed confidence that the All Progressive Congress (APC) will definitely win the Saturday Governorship election and the Kogi west senatorial rerun election.</p>
