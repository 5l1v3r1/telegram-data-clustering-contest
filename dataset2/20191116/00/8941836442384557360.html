      <p>HOUSTON (AP) - The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/houston-rockets/">Houston Rockets</a> got another huge offensive game from James Harden.</p>
      <p>But it was the team’s defense against the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/indiana-pacers/">Indiana Pacers</a> that the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/houston-rockets/">Rockets</a> thought was the most impressive part of their win.</p>
      <p>Harden scored 44 points and the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/houston-rockets/">Rockets</a> used a big fourth quarter run to pull away and get the 111-102 victory on Friday night.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/houston/">Houston</a> has won a season-high six games in a row and Harden has scored 36 points or more in five straight games to carry the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/houston-rockets/">Rockets</a> as they deal with injuries to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/clint-capela/">Clint Capela</a>, Eric Gordon and Danuel House.</p>
      <p>Indiana led by 4 on a 3-pointer by Doug McDermott before <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/houston/">Houston</a> used a 14-0 spurt to make it 94-88 with about five minutes left. Harden took over in that stretch, scoring the last 12 points and making two 3-pointers. The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/indiana-pacers/">Pacers</a> couldn’t do anything offensively as <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/houston/">Houston</a> built its lead and missed seven shots and had two turnovers.</p>
      <hr/>

      <p>Harden was asked how big the team’s defense in that stretch was to the win.</p>
      <p>“It was huge,” Harden said. “That’s the game right there.”</p>
      <p>Indiana got its first point in almost five minutes when Domantas Sabonis made the second of two free throws with less than five minutes to go and Justin Holiday made a layup about a minute later.</p>
      <p>But Russell Westbrook hit a 3-pointer seconds after that to push the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/houston-rockets/">Rockets</a>’ lead to 10 with three minutes remaining.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>Though the defense has improved during this winning streak, Westbrook still sees room for improvement.</p>
        <p>“We’re moving in the right direction,” he said. “We’re doing a good job of staying locked in for the most part … and it’s showing.”</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/indiana-pacers/">Pacers</a> cut it to six points with a 3 by Aaron Holiday with about a minute left, but Tyson Chandler added a tip-in layup to secure the victory.</p>
        <p>Sabonis had 18 points and 13 rebounds and McDermott added 18 points off the bench as Indiana had its four-game winning streak was snapped.</p>
        <p>Ben McLemore had a season-high 21 points and Westbrook scored 17 with eight rebounds and six assists.</p>
        <p>“He hit some timely 3s,” coach Mike D’Antoni said of McLemore. “His defense is always pretty good. He runs the floor. He plays really hard and he can shoot. So yeah - he was good.”</p>
        <p>A dunk by Justin Holiday got the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/indiana-pacers/">Pacers</a> within four points midway through the third quarter before <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/houston/">Houston</a> used an 8-2 run to make it 75-65 with about four minutes left in the quarter. McLemore led the way in that stretch with two 3-pointers.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/indiana-pacers/">Pacers</a> got going after that, scoring the next 10 points to tie it with about a minute left in the third. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/houston/">Houston</a> missed five shots and had a turnover to allow Indiana to close the gap.</p>
        <p>Austin Rivers ended a scoring drought of more than three minutes by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/houston/">Houston</a> after that, but Indiana scored the next four points to take a 79-77 lead.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/houston/">Houston</a> entered the fourth quarter up by 1 after P.J. Tucker hit a 3-pointer at the end of the third.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/indiana-pacers/">Pacers</a>, who were already without Myles Turner and Jeremy Lamb because of injuries, played most of Friday’s game without Malcolm Brogdon after he left in the first quarter with a sore lower back.</p>
        <p>“That’s a big loss when you’re going up against guys like Harden and Westbrook,” coach Nate McMillan said. “Not only do you need him offensively but you need his size defensively.”</p>
        <p>TIP-INS</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/indiana-pacers/">Pacers</a>: Turner missed his eighth straight game with a sprained right ankle, but could return on Saturday night. … Lamb sat out for the fifth game in a row with a sprained left ankle. … T.J. Warren busted his lip and was bleeding after a collision in the third quarter. He was tended to by a trainer for a few minutes and re-entered the game late in the quarter.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/houston-rockets/">Rockets</a>: C <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/clint-capela/">Capela</a> missed the game and won’t play on Saturday after sustaining a concussion on Wednesday night. … Rivers scored 10 points off the bench. … <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/houston/">Houston</a> made 14 of 46 3-pointers.</p>
        <p>LIKE FATHER, LIKE SON</p>
        <p>Chandler made his first start of the season in place of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/clint-capela/">Capela</a> at center against Sabonis. It wasn’t the first time he’d played against a member of the Sabonis family, after playing two games against Sabonis’s father, Arvydas Sabonis, in his last NBA season in 2002-03. Chandler, who was in his second NBA season, was 20 that year and Arvydas Sabonis was 38.</p>
        <p>“Both of them are great players,” the 37-year-old Chandler said. “His dad was huge and so skilled. I think I caught him at the end of his career after injuries and all that. But his son is really good and has a bright future ahead of him.”</p>
