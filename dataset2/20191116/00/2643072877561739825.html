      <h1>Kogi 2019 Election: Dino Melaye Casts His Vote</h1>

      <p><b>Senator Dino Melaye</b> on Saturday, November 16, cast his vote in the on-going elections in Kogi State.</p>
      <p><b>Naija News</b> reports he cast his vote at the polling unit 004, Ayetoro Gbede 1, Ijumu local government area of the state.</p>
      <p>Until an appeal court judgement which ordered a rerun, <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/dino-melaye/"><u><b>Dino Melaye</b></u></a>, was the Senator representing Kogi west senatorial district in the upper chamber of the National Assembly.</p>
      <p>Earlier, the Kogi State National Assembly/State Assembly election petition tribunal sitting in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital, <b><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/08/23/breaking-tribunal-nullifies-dino-melayes-election/"><u>nullified Senator Melaye’s election</u></a></b> in August.</p>
      <p>This online news platform recalls that Mr. Melaye was declared the winner of the Kogi West Senatorial election by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in February.</p>
      <p>The results declared by INEC showed that Melaye, who contested the election on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) scored 85,395 votes to defeat <b>Smart Adeyemi</b> of the All Progressives Congress (APC), who polled 66,901 votes.</p>
      <p>Apparently displeased with the outcome of the election Adeyemi approached the tribunal.</p>
      <p>On Friday, October 11, the <b><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/10/11/breaking-dino-melaye-loses-appeal-fresh-election-ordered/"><u>Appeal Court</u></a></b> maintained the judgment of the tribunal and ordered a fresh election within 90 days in the Kogi West Senatorial district.</p>
      <p>A three-man panel led by Justice A. O. Chijioke in a unanimous judgment accepted Adeyemi’s ground and ordered for reelection into the Kogi West senatorial district.</p>
