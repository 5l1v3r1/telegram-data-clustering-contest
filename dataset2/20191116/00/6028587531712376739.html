      <p><b><i>Joker </i>tops <i>The Dark Knight </i>($1.004 billion in 2008) to become the biggest movie never to play in China, as <i>Doctor Sleep, Last Christmas </i>and <i>Midway </i>take discomforting drops on Friday. </b>In holdover news, Lionsgate’s <i>Midway </i>earned $2.5 million (-61%) on Friday, setting the stage for a likely $8.6 million (-53%) weekend and $34.99 million ten-day cume. That’s not a good hold, which is at least partially due to <i>Ford v Ferrari </i>stealing away the older male demographics, but Lionsgate was only on the hook for domestic and UK distribution and related marketing costs. A $50 million domestic finish will be squarely okay for the studio. Paramount’s <i>Playing With Fire</i>, which I may try to see with the kids later today, earned another $1.9 million (-47%) for a likely $7.67 million (-40%) second weekend and $24.618 million ten-day cume. The Jon Cena kid-targeted flick cost $30 million, so this one will need decent overseas numbers to justify itself.</p>
      <p><i>Last Christmas </i>earned another $2 million (-51%) on its second Friday, as the disappointing holiday romcom will likely earn just $6.6 million (-42%) in its second weekend for a $22.5 million ten-day cume. That sets up Paul Feig and Emma Thompson’s Emilia Clarke/Henry Golding flick for a final domestic total of just-under $40 million. Unless it pulls <i>Love Actually </i>or <i>In Time </i>number overseas, it’s a whiff. Warner Bros.’ <i>Doctor Sleep </i>crashed in weekend two, earning $1.685 million (-68%) on Friday for a likely $5.77 million (-59%) second weekend. That’ll give Mike Flanagan’s $45 million horror flick a $24.628 million ten-day total and a likely domestic finish of over/under $37 million. Audiences didn’t care about a sequel to <i>The Shining</i>. Once again, IP proved to be a repellent.</p>

      <p>Warner Bros. <i>Joker</i>, on the other hand, earned another $1.475 million (-42%) to bring its domestic cume up to $318.44 million. That puts it above the raw domestic grosses of <i>The Fellowship of the Ring </i>($313 million in 2001), <i>Thor: Ragnarok </i>($315 million in 2017) <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone </i>($317 million in 2001) and <i>Iron Man </i>($318 million in 2008). It positions the film for a $5.2 million (44%) weekend and $322 million domestic cume. It crossed $1 billion worldwide on Friday and, with a new global cume just over the $1.004 billion gross of <i>The Dark Knight </i>(back in 2008), <i>Joker </i>is now the biggest global grosser, sans inflation, to never play in China. It should be at over/under $1.015 billion worldwide by tomorrow night.</p>
      <p>Walt Disney’s <i>Maleficent: Mistress of Evil </i>earned $1.187 million (-40%) to pass $100 million domestic, setting the stage for a $4.86 million (-42%) fifth weekend and $105.653 million 31-day cume. Presuming it has still earned 78% of its money overseas, the $185 million Angelina Jolie flick will end tomorrow night with around $465 million worldwide. That’s past the arbitrary 2.5x “break even” point. It may not be a super smash, but it’ll eventually break even (and possibly turn a profit) over the long haul as it makes its way to $500 million global. Moreover, to the extent that the ten million (or more) Disney+ subscribers missed this one in theaters, it’ll be an A-level premiere when it pops up on the streaming service next year.</p>

        <figcaption>'Harriet'<cite>Focus Features</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Focus Features’ <i>Harriet </i>earned $1.25 million (-37%) on its third Friday, setting the stage for a $4.56 million (-38%) weekend and solid $31.663 million 17-day cume. This one has shown strong legs, as befitting its A+ Cinemascore grade, and I wouldn’t count Cynthia Erivos out of the Oscar race just yet. In other Oscar news, Fox Searchlight’s <i>Jojo Rabbit </i>earned $754,000 (-33%) on Friday in 995 theaters for a likely $2.66 million (-33%) fifth weekend and $13.44 million domestic cume. I still think this crowdpleasing Taiki Waititi dramedy ends up as an Oscar front runner, because A) it’s playing well with consumers and would-be voters and B) Disney is going to push it hard to show that Fox movies can still win Oscars under the Disney umbrella.</p>
      <p>Skydance’s <i>Terminator: Dark Fate </i>earned another $1.1 million (-62%) on Friday for a likely $3.98 million (-63%) third weekend and miserable $56.5 million 17-day cume. Presuming it kept is domestic (Paramount)/overseas (Fox/Disney, save for China) split intact, it’ll end tomorrow with around $232 million worldwide. <i>Zombieland: Double Tap </i>will have $70.3 million domestic as of tomorrow, while <i>Parasite </i>will earn $1.86 million (-28%) for a robust $14.4 million domestic cume. <i>Black &amp; Blue </i>is no big hit, but the terrific Deon Taylor-directed action drama, starring Naomi Harris and Tyrese Gibson, will cross $20 million domestic tomorrow. <i>Motherless Brooklyn </i>had a decent hold in weekend two, but it lost 731 theaters in weekend three and tumbled 79% for a $135,000 weekend and $8.45 million ten-day cume.</p>
