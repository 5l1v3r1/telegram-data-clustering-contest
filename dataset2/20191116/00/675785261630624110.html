      <h2>Wales boss Giggs demands discipline from his players as Dragons target maximum points from final two games in bid to reach Euro 2020 finals</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T00:38:44+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 00:38</time> by <a rel="author">James Nursey, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/james-nursey/</a></address>
      <p>Ryan Giggs has urged his stars to avoid picking up costly suspensions in Baku as Wales’ Euro 2020 bid enters “squeaky bum time”.</p>
      <p>Wales are without the suspended Joe Allen this evening for their penultimate qualifier away to Azerbaijan.</p>
      <p>And Giggs is wary key duo Daniel James and Gareth Bale are both one booking away from missing Wales’ potentially crucial final qualifier at home to Hungary on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Dragons boss Giggs said: “We’ve seen Joe Allen miss out on this game because of suspension.</p>
      <p>“Discipline is a big part of winning games so we will need to be disciplined.</p>

      <p>“You still you want players to be competitive and committed but with an eye of not giving away stupid fouls to get easy yellow cards.”</p>
      <p>Giggs has been boosted by the return of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> midfielder Aaron Ramsey, who is pushing to start his first qualifier in this campaign.</p>
      <p>Giggs has now urged Wales to build on two crucial draws last month against Slovakia and Croatia as he eyes automatic qualification.</p>
      <p>And he confirmed it was “squeaky bum time” when the legendary phrase used by his ex-Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson was put to him.</p>

      <p>Giggs replied: “It has been for the last few games. They’re two big games and obviously you’re running out of games.</p>
      <p>“We will probably need to win both games. We’re just focused on Saturday and winning the game. It’s as simple as that.</p>
      <p>“The players are ready, they’re looking forward to it. But Azerbaijan had a good result 1-1 at home last time here against Croatia, so it’s not easy, but the lads are ready for it.”</p>
      <p>If Wales win their final two games and Slovakia drop points against either Croatia or Azerbaijan, Giggs' side will claim a spot at next summer's Euro 2020 finals.</p>
