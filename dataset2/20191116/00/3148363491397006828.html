      <p>Thirteen-year-old Carlos Cabrera was walking to school that morning when he <a href="https://www.kristv.com/news/local-news/man-in-manhole-teen-hero-recognized">heard</a> someone calling for help, according to KRIS 6. However, it took Carlos a moment to figure out where the voice was coming from as he approached the building.</p>
      <p>“I thought it was coming from the cafeteria, but I got more over (towards the manhole) and it was in there,” he said.</p>
      <p>Cabrera knew he had to do something quick, so he ran to a teacher, who alerted the school’s resource officer, Orlando Sanchez.</p>
      <p>Once Sanchez radioed rescue crews, he went over to where Cabrera said he heard the cries for help.</p>
      <p>“As I got closer to the manhole I started hearing the voices even louder,” he recalled. “I was able to remove the manhole cover, and there was a gentleman in there about waist high in sewage.”</p>
      <p>Corpus Christi Independent School District Police Chief Kirby Warnke <a href="https://www.kristv.com/news/local-news/homeless-man-rescued-after-seeking-shelter-in-man-hole">said</a> the man had crawled into the hole outside Haas Middle School the night before to try and escape the cold weather.</p>
      <p>Once Sanchez and rescue workers lifted him out of the manhole, he was taken to a nearby hospital and treated for a possible case of hypothermia. His condition is currently unknown.</p>
      <p>Thursday, Principal Anna Fuentes presented Cabrera with a special certificate in celebration of his heroic efforts.</p>
      <p>“In recognition for the display of responsiveness award this certificate of excellence to Carlos Cabrera in appreciation for alerting authorities and displaying compassion for someone in need,” the certificate read.</p>
      <p>“We’re so proud of Carlos for doing the right thing,” Fuentes said of her remarkable student:</p>

      <p>An October <a href="https://www.kristv.com/news/homeless-corpus-christi-crisis-on-our-streets/the-citys-homeless-population-is-growing-but-why">survey</a> estimated that about 380 homeless people currently live in Corpus Christi, compared to 424 in 2018.</p>
      <p>“We have amazing service providers, and this is a really generous community,” <a href="https://www.kristv.com/how-many-homeless-people-are-in-corpus-christi">said</a> Homeless Outreach Coordinator Emily Shafer Northrup.</p>
