        <b>It is the penultimate matchday of group C, the group of death. Holland, Germany and Northern Ireland are still fighting for two places at Euro 2020.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>The draw will be in just two weeks</b> because the group phase will end in a few days. <b>Two matchdays remain in this group </b>and the first of them will be this Saturday.</p>
      <p>Germany host Belarus while Holland travel to Northern Ireland. Estonia, the other team in the group, will sit out. <b>The first three teams are fightng for two berths </b>and that could well end up being decided on this matchday. </p>
      <p><b>The Germans will be at the Euros with a draw</b> as long as Holland win in Belfast. That will increase the gap between the Germans and the Northern Irish to four points, <b>something the Northern Irish team would not be able to make up </b>on the last day. </p>

      <p>Joachim Low's men must win to have it in their own hands on the last day. <b>They could still qualify with two losses depending on what Holland do.</b> The Dutch team are in the best position as they have Estonia at home in their final match. </p>
      <p>Northern Ireland are in the toughest position as they have to face two direct rivals in three days. <b>O'Neill's men have shown in the past they can do well though.</b> </p>
      <p>What looked like a straight forward group for Germany and Holland <b>has not turned out that way.</b> </p>
      <p>The good news for all three sides is that <b>whoever finishes outside the top two is guaranteed to have a second chance</b> in the Nations League play-offs. Germany, Holland and Northern Ireland<b> are all guaranteed at least play-off spot </b>and Belarus will also be in the play-offs.</p>
