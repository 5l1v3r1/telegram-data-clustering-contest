      <p><b>NEWS</b> – Has this ever happened to you? You just plopped down $6 at your favorite coffee shop, but about halfway through enjoying your hot cup of whatever it gets ice cold, and you end up tossing it into the trash. Now there’s a way to keep it warm, so the only thing you’ll be throwing out is an empty cup. The Coffee Cookie is a cute little rechargeable disk that’s designed to keep your favorite beverage hot on-the-go.</p>
      <p>The Coffee Cookie is designed to snap securely onto the bottom of most standard paper coffee cups. If it doesn’t fit, not a problem, it doubles as a coaster and works just as good. Here’s how it works. Once your beverage reaches a drinkable temperature, turn Coffee Cookie on. It will keep your beverage at that temperature for twice as long. When you’re finished, throw the cup into the trash and the Coffee Cookie into your pocket.</p>

      <p>The Coffee Cookie charges using a standard USB cable. It only takes an hour to charge, and you can use it multiple times during the day. The internal battery has a life span of one year.</p>
      <p>The Coffee Cookie is available on their <a href="https://www.coffeecookie.com/Try.aspx">site</a> for $15.50 shipped. The best part is you can try it out risk-free for 30-days. If you’re not happy for any reason, contact Coffee Cookie for a refund.</p>
