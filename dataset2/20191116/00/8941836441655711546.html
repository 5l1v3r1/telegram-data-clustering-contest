      <p>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - Texas coach <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/shaka-smart/">Shaka Smart</a> says he has the components of a good offensive team. Until they are assembled and working properly, the Longhorns will rely more on defense.</p>
      <p>On Friday night, Texas forced 21 Prairie View A&amp;M; turnovers and limited Chancellor Ellis, a dangerous shooter, to two 3-point baskets while defeating the Panther 70-56.</p>
      <p>“We want out defense to be our anchor,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/shaka-smart/">Smart</a> said. “The last two games, we scored 26 points in the first half, but our defense allowed us to have a lead going into halftime both times.”</p>

      <p>Donovan Williams added 13 points and four steals for the Longhorns, and Jase Febres scored 10. He made two 3-point baskets in a span of less than two minutes in the second half, enabling Texas to create some separation.</p>

      <p>Texas (4-0) has won nine consecutive games, including five while winning the NIT last spring.</p>
      <p>Lenell Henry led Prairie View (1-3) with 12 points but he committed eight turnovers. Ellis scored 11. Ellis made eight 3-pointers against Central Florida on Nov. 9, putting Prairie View’s next two opponents, Texas State and Texas, on alert. He hit 2 of 6 in each of those games.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>“I think it’s called a scouting report,” Prairie View coach Byron Smith said. “It’s not gonna be easy to get a shot off.”</p>
        <p>Texas and Prairie View spent the first half matching frenetic effort but also striking inefficiency.</p>
        <p>Neither team achieved 40% shooting accuracy. Prairie View missed six of its seven 3-point attempts, while Texas hit 4 of 18. The Panthers committed 11 turnovers, the Longhorns nine.</p>
        <p>Both teams improved in the second half, Texas shooting 50% and Prairie View 48.</p>
        <p>Texas hit 5 of 14 from distance in the second half, and relied more on driving to the basket. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/shaka-smart/">Smart</a> move considering Texas has shot 3-pointers with less than 30 percent accuracy this season.</p>
        <p>“We wanted to come out more aggressive,” Jones said. “We played a little timid, shot a lot of threes in the first half. We just decided we were gonna play to our advantage and get stops and pound the ball into the paint.”</p>
        <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
        <p>Texas: The Longhorns were happy, of course, to pull out victories after struggling in the first half against mid-majors Cal Baptist and Prairie View. But they will have to play better at a tournament at New York’s Madison Square Garden next week. They start with Georgetown on Thursday and face either No. 2 Duke or California on Friday.</p>
        <p>“We did some good things,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/shaka-smart/">Smart</a> said. “But overall, if we want to go up there and win, we have to play better. We are very, very capable”</p>
        <p>Prairie View: The nonconference schedule is like a fundraiser for the Panthers, who collect paydays by playing 11 straight games on the road, including four against schools from Power 5 conferences as well as No. 12 Seton Hall. Prairie View lost at Texas State 75-48 on Tuesday. After that, though, the Panthers move back to their weight class, the Southwestern Athletic Conference, which they won last season – the regular season and the conference tournament.</p>
        <p>POLL IMPLICATIONS</p>
        <p>Texas, 28th in votes received on Monday, will have to wait until those two games next week before playing games that might impact its standing much.</p>
        <p>BETTER LUCK LAST TIME</p>
        <p>Prairie View coach Byron Smith was a starting guard on a University of Houston team that beat Texas three times during the 1989-90 season. Texas nevertheless advanced to the NCAA Tournament Elite Eight. Houston lost in the first round.</p>
        <p>UP NEXT</p>
        <p>Texas: Longhorns face Georgetown at New York’s Madison Square Garden on Thursday in the 2K Empire Classic benefitting Wounded Warrior Project. The Longhorns will meet either California or Duke on Friday.</p>
        <p>Prairie View A&amp;M;: The Panthers are at California on Monday.</p>
