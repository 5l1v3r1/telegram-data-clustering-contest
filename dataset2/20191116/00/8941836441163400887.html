      <p>MACCLENNY, Fla. (AP) - Residents in a rural northern Florida community are fuming over a judge’s recent decision to dismiss a case against a 15-year-old who shared a six-page “School Shooting Plan” with a classmate.</p>
      <p>Anxieties spread across Baker County when news spread in September about a potential massacre.</p>
      <p>After being alerted by the student’s classmate, authorities say they took action to avert another Parkland school shooting, which killed 17 people last year.</p>
