        <b>The West Ham v Arsenal match scheduled for the 9th December could be canceled. The reason is none other than the discovery of a WW2 bomb close to the London Olympic Stadium.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Incredible but true. On Saturday an <b>explosive </b>was found on the outskirts of the London Olympic Stadium. The Police even cordoned off a 150m perimeter.</p>
      <p>"We think it is an <b>unexploded bomb</b>. It's crazy to think of all the people walking around here during the Olympics and we had no idea it was here", a source told 'The Sun'.</p>
      <p>In this way, according to the aforementioned source, a West Ham match could thus be canceled. The match will be against Arsenal on <b>9th December</b>.</p>
      <p>They will play against Tottenham on 23rd November before that match, but it is not in the Police's plans to cancel that match, as they will not get things underway <b>until the 25th</b>.</p>
      <p>"<b>The bomb is in a tricky position</b>, so could take up to two weeks to sort it out, which takes us into the second week of December",Â the aforementioned source stated.</p>
      <p>A representative of the Olympic Park also spoke. They confirmed that there was "<b>an unexplained metal object </b>that was found when working near the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park".</p>
