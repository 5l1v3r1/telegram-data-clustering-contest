        <b>Juri Vips took a controlled win in the Macau Grand Prix qualification race, as a first-lap pile-up took a number of potential contenders out of the running.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It was a near-perfect race for Vips, who avoided giving away the slipstream into Lisboa on the first lap before controlling the remainder of the 10-lap affair.</p>
      <p>He managed to keep second-placed Robert Shwartzman just out of DRS range, the final gap to the Russian 1.5 seconds at the finish.</p>
      <p>"I didn't want to take full risk at the beginning," said Vips. "The track changes overnight, so you couldn't immediately be at 100%.</p>
      <p>"You had to build it up a little bit. It's never really perfect, but there were no mistakes.</p>
      <p>"I didn't expect starting from pole to be the best thing, but I really got a mega start and Robert didn't get the best one. I think that's why I led into the first braking zone.</p>
      <p>"I think if people around me get a good start tomorrow it'll be a bit harder, but I'll try my best."</p>
      <p>Prema driver Shwartzman admitted he did not quite have enough to take the fight to Hitech Grand Prix's Vips.</p>
      <p>"It wasn't the best, but it wasn't bad. It definitely wasn't as good as Juri's start," said Shwartzman.</p>
      <p>"Juri was quick at the beginning, he built the gap. Towards the end I started to catch him, but it wasn't enough to get into the DRS."</p>
      <p>A fast start set up a surprising podium for ART's Christian Lundgaard, who finished a lonely third.</p>
      <p>Dutchman Richard Verschoor finished fourth, making one of very few passing moves at the front of the field on Callum Ilott at Lisboa with two laps to go.</p>
      <p>Dan Ticktum faces an uphill battle to win a third straight Macau GP, after the Briton was caught up in a costly first-lap clash at Lisboa.</p>
      <p>The crash started when Carlin's Logan Sargeant clipped Arjun Maini, whose Jenzer-run car was subsequently fired into the wall.</p>
      <p>That left a number of cars with nowhere to go, putting Jake Hughes out on the spot, while Ticktum, who was launched into the air, had to pit for repairs.</p>
      <p>He managed to get to the finish, but was classified 27th and two laps down.</p>
