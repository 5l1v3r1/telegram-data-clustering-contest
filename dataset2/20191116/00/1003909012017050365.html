      <p>Four out of five Alberta residents expect the provincial economy to deteriorate over the next year, according to a new poll.</p>
      <p>The <a href="http://angusreid.org/canada-economic-confidence-2020/">public opinion survey</a>, conducted by the non-profit Angus Reid Institute, said Canadians as a whole appear to be worried about the economy, with 43 per cent expecting a worsening of economic conditions in their province versus 21 per cent expecting an improvement.</p>
      <p>However, the survey also highlighted stark regional differences. In Quebec, for example, residents are more likely than not to say that conditions in the province will improve, while in Alberta 79 per cent expect conditions to worsen.</p>
      <p>Sixty-four per cent of Albertans — the highest rate of any province — are also concerned about potential household job losses. The number of Albertans who identified potential job loss as a “serious worry” is more than double the national average (34 per cent versus 14 per cent).</p>
      <p>The Angus Reid Institute also annually asks respondents if their standard of living is better or worse, and there, regional differences are also striking. In Quebec, the highest number of respondents say their standard of living has improved in a decade of tracking, while the number is lowest in Alberta. Notably, Alberta’s proportion of positive responses dropped by half immediately after Justin Trudeau’s Liberals formed government in 2015 and have remained low since. This year, 56 per cent of Albertans said their standard of living has worsened over the past 12 months.</p>
