      <p>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) - Authorities say security officers found a loaded handgun in a flight attendant’s carry-on bag at a Florida airport.</p>
      <p>The Orlando Sentinel reports that 28-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joseph-brozyna/">Joseph Brozyna</a> was arrested Thursday and charged with carrying a concealed firearm and carrying a firearm in a prohibited place.</p>
      <p>Police say the Frontier Airlines flight attendant was passing through security at Orlando International Airport when Transportation Security Administration agents found the .40 caliber pistol. An arrested report says <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joseph-brozyna/">Brozyna</a> acknowledged that the gun was his.
