      <p>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) - The state Department of Health says a study shows more than half of pregnancy-related deaths in Ohio over a four-year period were preventable.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/columbus-dispatch/">Columbus Dispatch</a> reports the statewide study released Friday shows that 57% of 89 reported pregnancy-related deaths from 2012 to 2016 could have been avoided.</p>
      <p>The study found a concerning racial disparity between black and white mothers. While 17% of the women giving birth were black, they accounted for 34% of pregnancy-related deaths in the state.</p>
