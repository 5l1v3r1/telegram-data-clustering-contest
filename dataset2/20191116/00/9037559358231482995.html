      <p>LAHORE: A man arrested over revenge porn on Friday maintained during a hearing that his bail request was justified as the woman whose videos he had allegedly shared on the Internet were made by herself.</p>
      <p>During a hearing presided by Justice Chaudhry Mushtaq Ahmed at the Lahore High Court, the Federal Investigation Agency's (FIA) Cybercrime Wing was issued a notice, the response to which has been sought by November 26.</p>
      <p>The hearing pertained to the bail petition submitted by Ejaz Bhatti, the man who was arrested for blackmailing a woman on social media through videos of her.</p>
      <p>Bhatti, the accused, said he had been arrested over the charge of sharing the videos of a woman on social media and maintained that the allegation against him of his demand to extort Rs1.2 million from the woman was wrong.</p>
      <p>The accused said no inappropriate videos were recovered from him and that the videos that he had been accused for were made by the woman herself, which is why he demanded his bail request be approved.</p>
