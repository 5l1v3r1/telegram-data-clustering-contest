      <p>A devastated woman shared shocking details of her 21-year-old son’s sexual fantasies and odd feelings claiming he was supposedly “sexually attracted” to her as evidenced by his “lustful” compliments on her appearance.</p>
      <p>Sikhangezile Mlotshwa from Bulawayo’s Nketa 9 suburb revealed that she was “confused” about her son Samuel Mlotshwa’s feelings towards her as he was always complimenting her appearance while calling her “yellow-bone”.</p>
      <p>So nasty is the two’s relationship as a result of the “creepy” compliments that the distressed mother didn’t want to stay with her son fearing that he might sexually abuse her.</p>
      <p>Sikhangezile, who apparently loves her son and wants their relationship to be nothing more than a mother-son bond, last week approached the Bulawayo Civil Court seeking protection against his (Samuel)’s inappropriate behaviour.</p>
      <p>“I don’t want him in the house as he is always drunk. He always admires me saying I am a “yellow bone” and I fear that he might rape me. It is a taboo in our culture that a son is sexually attracted to his mother,” bitterly complained Sikhangezile.</p>
      <p>She said she was living in fear of her son’s behaviour which she described as “completely inappropriate” adding that Samuel had over the years exhibited violent behaviour towards her.</p>
      <p>“On 23 October he came to my house where he was welcomed by his younger brothers aged 16 and 18. When I later arrived, he told me that he was not going anywhere while declaring that he was going to forcibly stay with me.</p>
      <p>“He started insulting me with unprintable words saying I hate him because he was dark in complexion. He even threatened to beat me up. As a result of his violent behaviour I don’t want him to come to my house as he is also into drugs,” declared Sikhangezile.</p>
      <p>To corroborate her claims, she produced a letter which was once served to her son as a last warning when he was still at school. The letter indicated that Samuel was abusing drugs and bringing dangerous weapons to school.</p>
      <p>In response, Samuel blamed his uncouth behaviour on his family’s church.</p>
      <p>“We used to go to a church called End Time Messages and at that church we were restricted from watching television and I was always confined in the house with nothing to do and I think that caused me to be unruly.</p>
      <p>“She is my biological mother but she has been harsh to me. I have never abused her as she has claimed. Whenever we had a misunderstanding, I would be telling her the truth that she hates me.</p>
      <p>“I once moved out to stay on my now but now life is difficult for me that’s why I decided to come back home. I had nowhere to go since my mother was always restraining me from visiting our relatives,” responded Samuel.</p>
      <p>Responding to his mother’s suggestion that he can go and stay with his father, Samuel said: “I can’t go and stay with him because currently he is in Botswana”.</p>
      <p>In his ruling the presiding magistrate Lesigo Ngwenya ordered Samuel to vacate his mother’s place and not to verbally and physically abuse her. – B-Metro</p>
