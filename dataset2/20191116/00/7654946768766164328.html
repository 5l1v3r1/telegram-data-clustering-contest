      <p>Colin Kaepernick’s audition is almost here.</p>
      <p>More than 24 teams are expected to be represented at <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/12/colin-kaepernick-holding-private-workout-for-possible-nfl-return/">a private workout session</a> with Kaepernick on Saturday at the Falcons’ facility outside Atlanta. The Jets and Giants are both set to attend.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old quarterback hasn’t played in the NFL since 2016, the season in which he began kneeling during the national anthem to protest police brutality and racial injustice. Kaepernick opted out of his contract with the 49ers at the end of that season.</p>
      <p>Former NFL head coaches Hue Jackson and Joe Philbin <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/former-nfl-coach-hue-jackson-to-run-colin-kaepernick-workout/">will lead Kaepernick through drills</a> in front of talent evaluators from a majority of NFL teams, though it is believed few if any general managers or head coaches will fly in the day before their teams play on Sunday.</p>
      <p>A few players, including Panthers safety Eric Reid — who kneeled alongside Kaepernick when they were teammates in San Francisco — have described the hastily scheduled workout as “disingenuous.”</p>
      <p>“I’ll believe it when I see it,” Reid said this week. “At this point, it <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/14/colin-kaepernick-nfl-staredown-has-adam-schefter-doubting-workout/">feels like a PR stunt</a>.”</p>
      <p>Patriots quarterback Tom Brady said it’s “pretty cool” that Kaepernick is the focus of this workout.</p>
      <p>“I think being a pro quarterback is very challenging in and of itself,” Brady said Thursday night on Westwood One radio. “To have time off is a challenge, but Colin’s overcome a lot of challenges in his career and he’s always found a way to produce. He’s very mentally tough, and I think it’s pretty cool that he’s getting that opportunity.”</p>
      <p>The Patriots are one of the teams that will attend Kaepernick’s workout, the NFL confirmed. The Cowboys and Panthers have said publicly they will not send reps to the workout.</p>
