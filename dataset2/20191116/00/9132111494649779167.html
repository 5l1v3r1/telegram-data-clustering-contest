      <p>Ghana's topmost fashion and cosmetology school, Abrantie College, has held its 12th graduation ceremony, promising to expand its operations to other African countries and the rest of the world in the foreseeable future.</p>
      <p>The graduation ceremony which came off on Friday November 15, 2019, at the National Theater in Accra, witnessed about 258 students passing out on the colourful occasion.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Breakdown Of Graduands</b>
      </p>
      <p>About 120 of the graduands benefitted from the Ghanaian Government's CBT programme which foots the tuition fee of youth who want to acquire technical and vocational education.</p>
      <p>Out of the 120 sponsored by Government, about 60 studied fashion and design, while the remaining 60 studied cosmetology.</p>
      <p>The remaining graduands who were not sponsored by government were considered as "main students" of Abrantie College and spent between two and three years at the College before graduating.</p>
      <p>Some of the graduands passed through the formal system while the others underwent informal system.</p>
      <p>The formal graduands were under the technical exams unit of the Ghana Education Service.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile those placed under the informal system spent 18 months to 2 years at the College to acquire the needed skills to set up their own businesses.</p>
