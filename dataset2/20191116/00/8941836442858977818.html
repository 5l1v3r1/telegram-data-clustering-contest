      <p>HAVANA (AP) - Hundreds of people in Cuba’s capital stood in line to kiss, touch or walk around a towering silk floss tree Saturday in a nod to tradition as they celebrate <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/havana/">Havana</a>’s 500th anniversary this weekend.</p>
      <p>The event comes as Cuba deals with an ailing economy and increasingly tense relations with the U.S., concerns that were briefly cast aside as residents prepared for a gala event Saturday night featuring fireworks, music and international dignitaries.</p>
      <p>As part of the celebrations, officials restored monuments, painted buildings, unveiled exhibitions and held book presentations.</p>
