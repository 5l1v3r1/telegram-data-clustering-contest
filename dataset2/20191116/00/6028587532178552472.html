      <p>“And he came to a place where the wild things are.” - <i>Where The Wild Things Are</i>The opening of Funko Hollywood was an extraordinary night for learning about storytelling. Funko as a brand believes that “everyone is a fan of something” and has built an entire brand around that belief. CEO Brian Mariotti was in attendance at the launch event, along with celebrities who shared what stories inspire them.</p>
      <p>Here are five storytelling lessons gleaned from the event that featured Shake Shack burgers and permanent oversized Funko Pop figures.</p>

        <b>1. Cultivate a sense of wonder.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Funko CEO Brian Mariotti did not hesitate when asked what his favorite childhood story was. <i>Where the Wild Things Are</i> by Maurice Sendak was his clear favorite, and when asked if that has impacted his work at Funko he answered, “It’s just childhood wonderment, things that make you happy. I think that’s what all of this thing is inside – little things that make somebody happy.” That simple act of cultivating a childlike wonder of infinite possibility is a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/goldiechan/2019/11/13/five-creative-storytelling-lessons-from-adobe-max/">storytelling</a> lesson that can be incorporated into just about any brand.</p>

        <b>2. Nostalgia sells.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It was obvious from what singer Carla Harvey shared that nostalgia is a key component of what drives Funko’s success. When asked what her favorite Funko is, she said, “I have so many great ones, but the one that I love the most right now this week today is Jim Henson and Kermit. He just got it for me a couple of weeks ago, and it sits next to my bed because it’s so nostalgic for me, and I love it.” A similar theme emerged when discussing her favorite pop culture phenomenon, the <i>Star Wars</i> franchise. “It’s crazy to me that something that came out to me around the same time that I was born is so huge, probably even bigger today. It’s incredible.” Powerful stories from decades past can continue to inspire.</p>

        <b>3. People show up for the right product.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Model Tess Holliday shared that her two favorite Funko products were Miss Piggy because it is difficult to find merchandise featuring that character and “a Splash Mountain one with Disneyland. I stood in line, and I don’t stand in line for nothing. But I stood in line, and I love them.” If audiences are truly excited about the story, they will show up.</p>

        <b>4. Not every product is for everyone.</b>
      </p>
      <p>On the other hand, storytellers should expect that not every story will resonate with every person. CEO Brian Mariotti said of the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/goldiechan/2019/07/21/funko-partnerships-sdcc2019/">new Funko l</a>ocation, “You can walk through 30,000 of the 40,000 square feet and nothing makes you smile, you walk around the corner and go oh my god, I never thought that they were going to have a Flintmobile from <i>The Flintstones</i>, and that’s how we’re going to get you. There’s something for everybody.” There is something for everybody, but not everybody will love every thing.</p>

        <b>5. Representation matters.</b>
      </p>
      <p>When asked about the pressures of portraying such an iconic character, actor Zoe Saldana shared how inspiring it is to her to connect with audiences who feel seen by watching her on screen. “It’s not until you’re at the premiere, you’re traveling the world, and you’re going through all these press lines and you have that one little girl that just lives outside of the traditional yesteryear of what is normal and traditional and she feels seen and heard and represented.”</p>
      <p>Saldana continues, “And then I’m all of a sudden repurposed and invigorated because it reminds me of me being that little girl in the 80’s and not having enough representation of myself in media and how that made me feel and how that really affected my identity. So I think that representation matters, it’s everything. It’s paramount for a child.” Because storytelling is so important to so many children – and they take those stories into adulthood! – it is critical to be making sure everyone gets the chance to tell their stories.</p>
      <p>It was so inspirational to hear firsthand how stories shape how children grow up to be and how Funko is leveraging that at their new Hollywood. Funko Hollywood tells nostalgic new stories with a sense of wonder, personalized products, and diverse representation with permanent photo opportunities and iconic toys.</p>
