      <p>CAIRO – 16 November 2019: Liverpool Senegalese winger, Sadio Mane, believes that he is lucky to share Liverpool’s attacking line with two top players, Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino. <br/><br/>“I always say it is very easy to work together. Personally, I just think myself very lucky to play alongside these great players. We are all from different countries and speak different first languages but I think football is one language” Mane said. <br/><br/>The prolific front three players formed a successful partnership that made the Reds one of the best teams in Europe with goal scoring tally of 183 goals after Salah and Mane goals against Man City on Sunday at the league. <br/><br/>Mane continued “Every single player who plays alongside them would enjoy it because they are very good players and they make everything easy, so I just enjoy playing alongside them.” <br/><br/>The front three played a massive role in the club’s success last year in which they clinched the club’s sixth Champions League title in Madrid after defeating Tottenham 2-0. <br/><br/>Liverpool are dreaming of aceiving the league title and they are 8 points clear of Leicester City and Chelsea who share the second place.</p>
