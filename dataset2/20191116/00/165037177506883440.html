        <b>The Brazil captain has slammed Leo Messi, accusing him of influencing the referee and having a lack of manners.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Argentina beat Brazil through a Leo Messi rebound after he missed the original penalty.</p>
      <p>After the match, Thiago Silva showed his discontent with the referee and Messi's actions, accusing the latter of always influencing the official's decisions.</p>
      <p>"<b>Messi kept moaning to the referee and he didn't do anything</b>. He argued with the referee and continued to laugh. You have to leave the admiration aside", Silva said in some statements reported by the newspaper 'Sport'.</p>
      <p>Thiago Silva confessed that he also spoke to some La Liga players about these actions that the defender sees in Leo Messi. "<b>He is always looking to force the referee to give him a foul</b> and he always acts this way. <b>We have spoken with some players in Spain</b> and it's the same, he looks to control the play and interfere with the referee's decisions".</p>

      <p>Thiago Silva was more relieved to talk about the Champions League and the way of refereeing the European competition and thinks that it does not benefit the Argentine.</p>
      <p>"In the Champions League, he doesn't have that advantage because the referees are tougher. You don't see him trying to say so much and there are referees who side with him out of admiration. <b>As we did not have Neymar</b>, we were at a disadvantage," he continued.</p>
      <p>With regards to Messi's gesture to Tite, who he told to shut up, Thiago Silva saw a lack of manners: "It is hard to understand when we speak about manners on the park and one of the most admired players in the world does that. As much as there is rivalry<b>, manners have to come first</b>".</p>
