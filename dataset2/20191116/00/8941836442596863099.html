      <p>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) - James Blackman threw three touchdown passes and Khalan Laborn had two TD runs as Florida State defeated FCS Alabama State 49-12 on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Seminoles (6-5) are bowl-eligible under interim head coach Odell Haggins for the second time in three years. Haggins is 4-0 as an interim coach, first filling in at the end of the 2017 season after Jimbo Fisher left for Texas A&amp;M; and now after the dismissal of Willie Taggart on Nov. 3.</p>
      <p>Blackman tossed a 69-yard touchdown pass to Tamorrion Terry and a 39-yard touchdown pass to Tre’Shaun Harrison as the Seminoles racked up 550 yards on offense.</p>
