      <p>
        <b><a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/electricals/dixontechnologies/DT07">Dixon Technologies</a> | Up 20 percent</b>
      </p>
      <p>Shares of Dixon Technologies gained 20 percent in last week after healthy earnings growth in Q2FY20 and strong management commentary.</p>
      <p>The stock touched fresh 52-week high of Rs 3,375.90 on the BSE.</p>
      <p>"We will surpass our earlier guidance of 40 percent revenue growth for FY20. In fact, we are looking at 50 percent revenue growth for FY20," Saurabh Gupta, Chief Financial Officer told CNBC-TV18.</p>
      <p>He said the company has been adding customers across all the segments. "Additional capacity and exports will drive lighting business. Cash conversion cycle is zero days currently," he added.</p>
      <p>The lighting products, LED TVs and semi-automatic washing machines manufacturer and supplier reported highest ever quarterly sales in Q2FY20, driven by the consumer electronics segment.</p>
      <p>Consolidated revenue during the quarter grew by 89.8 percent YoY to Rs 1,402 crore and profit increased 162 percent YoY to Rs 43 crore due to lower tax cost (down 35 percent), but finance cost was higher at Rs 93 crore in Q2 against Rs 49 crore YoY.</p>

      <p>Brokerages also remained positive on the stock after stellar earnings performance and expect a double-digit return.</p>
      <p>"We remain positive on Dixon Technologies and expect a potential upside of 19-21 percent as the company delivered a healthy set of Q2FY2020 numbers and is likely to report robust revenue and earnings CAGRs of 19.6 percent and 33.7 percent, respectively, over FY2019-FY2022," Sharekhan said.</p>
      <p>"We raised FY20/21E EBITDA by 8 percent/10 percent as we incorporate higher growth in the revenues of consumer electronics and lighting, along with a turnaround in servicing business," said Emkay which maintained buy call on the stock with a revised target price of Rs 3,605.</p>
      <p>
        <b><a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/auto-ancillaries/amararajabatteries/ARB">Amara Raja Batteries</a> | Up 14 percent</b>
      </p>
      <p>The brokerage houses retained a bullish stance on the stock after the company showed consistent margin growth performance in Q2FY20.</p>
      <p>At the operating level, EBITDA grew by 22.9 percent YoY to Rs 292 crore and margin expanded 388bps YoY to 17.2 percent in the quarter ended September 2019, beating analyst estimates.</p>
      <p>Margin has risen for the fifth consecutive quarter due to the lag impact of 7 percent fall in lead prices in Q1FY20. Raw material cost as a percentage of sales fell 65 percent from 69.3 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ). The gross margin improvement was supported by lower lead prices and better mix across segments.</p>
      <p>Profit during the quarter shot up 82 percent YoY to Rs 218.6 crore due to lower tax expenses.</p>
      <p>Despite the steep fall in OEM revenues and lower realisations, Amara Raja's Q2FY20 revenues declined only marginally by 3.3 percent YoY to Rs 1,695 crore on healthy growth in replacement and industrial segments.</p>
      <p>"We expect revenue/earnings CAGRs at 8 percent/16 percent for FY19-22. The average return on equity/return on capital employed will likely to be strong at 17 percent/22 percent over FY20-22E. In addition, free cash flow generation should remain healthy at an average of Rs 42 crore per year over this period," said Emkay which maintained a buy rating on the stock.</p>
      <p>The brokerage revised its target price to Rs 784 (up from Rs 760 earlier), implying 20 percent potential upside from current levels.</p>
      <p>Motilal Oswal upgraded its FY20 EPS estimates by around 13 percent (FY21 by around 2 percent) to factor in the benefit of lower lead prices and mix.</p>
      <p>"We maintain a buy call with a target price of Rs 790, implying 21 percent potential upside from current levels," it said.</p>
      <p>

It further said that execution remains robust so far in FY20 adding that order book stands at Rs 11,000 crore as of September 2019.</p>
      <p>The company's order book included 30 percent each from marine and metro segments while it has taken up an order to construct Pune and Trichy airport. ITD Cementation's order book currently stands at Rs 13,000 crore, Patwardhan added.</p>
      <p>ITD Cementation's receivables inched higher due to better execution and its consolidated net debt stands at Rs 470 crore. Kolkata project won’t impact margins significantly while the metro project might impact cash flows in the near term, Patwardhan added.</p>
