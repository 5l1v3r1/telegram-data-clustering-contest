      <p>ESTEPONA, Spain (AP) — In the sunshine outside a large convention center in the southern Spanish city of Estepona, some very fit-looking people in scanty clothing applied fake tans and rehearsed statuesque poses.</p>
      <p>They all had one thing in mind: to win Spain’s annual national bodybuilding championship.</p>
      <p>This year’s 51st edition, organized by the Spanish Bodybuilding Federation, drew more than 500 contestants from across the country. It took place over two days.</p>
      <p>Most of the contestants came with other members of their clubs or teams. They helped apply the fake tans, directed poses and gave last-minute tips to the contestants.</p>
      <p>The center buzzed with people getting ready, resting on mats or exercising. Contestants did push-ups, lifted weights, drank protein shakes and ate from lunchboxes.</p>
      <p>On the stage, a presenter entertained the audience, and loud techno music was played to encourage contestants during performances.</p>
      <p>Advertising</p>
      <p>Men and women, sorted by weight or height, smiled broadly at the panel of judges while presenting their best poses.</p>
      <p>Backstage, the next group of nervous contestants waited to walk onto the stage. Some did last-minute exercises to pump up their muscles, others posed in front of a mirror. There was not much interaction among them — all were completely focused on making an impression on the judges and reaching the final round.</p>
      <p>Five couples took part in a Couples’ Bodybuilding competition. The first round consisted of posing as the judges ordered; then it was time for each couple to perform a chosen routine.</p>
      <p>There were some basic dance moves, interspersed with calculated poses rehearsed to perfection, all to the rhythm of music.</p>
      <p>Long hours of hard training combined with a strict diet and the determination to be the best in the country drive these athletes, day after day and month after month.</p>
