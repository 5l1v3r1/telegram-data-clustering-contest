      <p>Budgeting money is important for us to be able to meet our expenses whether in the home or business, manage our money, and keep our finances in check. We need to know where our money is going, and put away enough to pay for our monthly bills. It is important for every bit of our income be accounted for, so that we are aware of where we might be spending too much, and where we can cut back so that our most important expenses are covered at the end of the month.</p>

          <p>To create a budget, write down the income you bring in each month, then make a list of all of your monthly expenses. Include fixed payments, such as your mortgage or rent, flexible expenses like your groceries, and discretionary expenses like eating out or hobbies that are not necessary for your survival. If you have payments which are due periodically, such as quarterly insurance payments, calculate how much per month you need to set aside to pay those bills as well.

Record the net monthly income that you receive.</b> Net income is the amount that you actually get to take home, after all the deductions (taxes, health care) have been subtracted. Include other sources of income as well if applicable, such as tips, monthly bonuses, cost of living increases, dividends, interest income, etc.<sup><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Create-a-Budget#_note-1">[1]</a></sup></p>

You pretty much have to do things topsy-turvy.<sup><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Create-a-Budget#_note-2">[2]</a></sup> Determine all your essential, priority and lifestyle expenses first. Then, with your paycheck, start paying off all your essential needs first, followed by your priority and then lifestyle expenses. The money you have left over can either be set aside for an emergency account or stashed away into savings.</li>

If you never see it, you won't miss it. Squirreling away savings will help you anticipate emergency scenarios and prepare you for retirement.</p>

That's because cash "feels" more real, so it hurts more than credit. Try carrying only cash around and see if you spend less.<sup><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Create-a-Budget#_note-5">[5]</a></sup></li>
                              <li>Look to see how much you spend on eating out, on your morning coffee from Starbucks, on watching movies in the cinema, and other costs you can cut back on. Many people need their Starbucks fix, even if there's a coffee machine at work. One cup of coffee per day, at $2.50 per cup, equals more than $900 per year! Think about what you could do with $900.</li>
                              <li>Begin to have the tough discussions about what you can cut back on or cut out altogether. Whether this conversation is made with a spouse or with yourself, try to be honest, forthright, and understanding. Nobody likes cutting back spending, even if it needs to be done.</li>

                                                  <li>Try to cut down your expenses. Get rid of any unessential spending like eating out or expensive entertainment. Consider taking public transportation rather than owning a car. Clip coupons, buy generic products, and avoid impulse purchases. Above all, stop incurring new debt. Contemplate getting a debit card and cut up and cancel your credit cards.</li>
                                                  <li>Create a spending plan that permits you to diminish your debts. Catalogue your necessary expenses, such as housing, health care, and optional expenses, like entertainment and vacations.</li>
