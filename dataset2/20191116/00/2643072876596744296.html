      <p>Governor <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/16/bayelsa-guber-nigerias-democracy-is-saddening-gov-dickson-speaks-on-electoral-process/"><u><b>Seriake Dickson</b></u></a> of Bayelsa State has massively won his polling unit in Oriewari ward 2, unit 5 in Toro-Orua, Sagbama local government.</p>
      <p>Senator Douye Diri of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) recorded 1906 votes in the unit to defeat Chief David Lyon of the All Progressives Congress (APC) who got 5 votes.</p>
      <p>Speaking earlier while after casting his vote, Dickson described the election as a sad commentary on Nigeria’s democracy.</p>
      <p><i>”Today is a sad commentary on our nation’s democracy,</i> ” he said.</p>
      <p>According to him, <b><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/apc/"><u>APC</u></a></b> thugs hijacked electoral materials and were protected by the military.</p>
      <p>He further noted that the election is not taking place in Nembe, Southern Ijaw and some other areas in the state.</p>
