      <h1>Here Are All The Celebrities Supporting Taylor Swift In Her Fight Against Big Machine</h1>

      <p>Most musicians suffer the slings and arrows of the music industry in silence. But Taylor Swift is not like most musicians.</p>
      <p>Over the last few months, Swift has been very public about the behaviour of Scott Borchetta and Scooter Braun, powerful music industry players who she says have essentially held her music ransom.</p>
      <p>This week, for instance, Swift <a href="https://junkee.com/taylor-swift-big-machine-accusations/230264">claimed that the two industry players were refusing to let her licence her own music for use in a live performance and in a comprehensive Netflix documentary made about her lif</a>e.</p>
      <p>In response, Swift went public, asking for help from her fans in convincing Borchetta and Braun that they should let her do with her own songs whatever she wants.</p>

      <p>In the hours since that statement went live, not only has Swift’s active and loyal fanbase jumped into action, so have a range of high-profile celebrities.</p>
      <p>Many of said celebrities are musicians — popstars who have clearly seen evidence of this kind of behind-the-scenes struggle before.</p>
      <p>For instance, Lily Allen pledged her solidarity, and Halsey waxed lyrical about the incident.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Swift’s friends, Camila Cabello and Selena Gomez, came out swinging for their bestie.</p>

      <p>But that’s not all. The replies on Swift’s tweet are positively stuffed with messages of support from her colleagues — even some that claim to have disagreed with her in the past.</p>
