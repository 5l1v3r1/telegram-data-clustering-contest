        <figcaption>BOSTON, MA - SEPTEMBER 25: Owner Jonathan Lau of The Vape Shop holds an e-cigarette at his store in ... [+] the Brighton neighborhood of Boston on Sep. 25, 2019. Dozens of Massachusetts vape shops are at risk of going under because of a four-month ban on the sale of vaping fluids, cartridges, and accessories imposed by Governor Charlie Baker on Tuesday over concerns about a mysterious lung-related illness. While many convenience stores and other retailers offer vaping products - as do marijuana dispensaries - some businesses rely almost exclusively on them for their revenue. Bakers emergency ban effectively shuts down those shops. (Photo by Lane Turner/The Boston Globe via Getty Images)<cite>Boston Globe via Getty Images</cite></figcaption>

      <p>If you use an app on your iPhone to control your vape pen, then you’ll want to make sure it doesn’t get deleted.Apple removed all 181 vaping-related apps from the App Store today. If you already have one of the apps installed it will continue to work; however, Apple will not be allowing the apps to updated nor will it allow people to download the apps again, <a href="https://www.axios.com/exclusive-apple-to-remove-vaping-apps-from-store-8669fd94-e92a-4ce4-a9e2-ce5afa598b67.html">Axios reports</a>.</p>
      <p>The reason for the move has to do primarily with the vaping-related deaths that have occurred over the past year. At least 42 people have died and more than 2000 have been treated for illnesses related to vaping.</p>
      <p>In a statement to Axios, Apple said the decision was made due to the potential risks vaping poses to user’s health:</p>
      <p>
        <i>We take great care to curate the App Store as a trusted place for customers, particularly youth, to download apps. We’re constantly evaluating apps, and consulting the latest evidence, to determine risks to users’ health and well-being.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Recently, experts ranging from the CDC to the American Heart Association have attributed a variety of lung injuries and fatalities to e-cigarette and vaping products, going so far as to call the spread of these devices a public health crisis and a youth epidemic.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>We agree, and we’ve updated our App Store Review Guidelines to reflect that apps encouraging or facilitating the use of these products are not permitted. As of today, these apps are no longer available to download.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Apple has never allowed apps in the App Store that sold vaping products. The apps in question are all either applications that a re used to stay up-to-date on vaping news, or those that are used to control things like temperature or lighting on a device.</p>
