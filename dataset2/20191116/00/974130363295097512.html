      <h1>Watch: Andrew Conway Scorches Ospreys Defence To Score Cracking Try</h1>

      <p>Munster have gotten their Champions Cup campaign off to the best possible start, securing a 32-13 win over Ospreys in Wales.</p>
      <p>While the game was close in the first half it never really seemed like this result was on doubt. Munster were the dominant team throughout, with the hosts unable to live with them.</p>
      <p>After a rather disastrous World Cup campaign, this was a chance for the Ireland internationals in the team to rediscover some of their form. The likes of Conor Murray, CJ Stander and Keith Earls were all in the team, but it was another Ireland player who came up with the most eye-catching moment of the game.</p>
      <p>Andrew Conway has been on an absolute tear as of late, making it increasingly obvious that he was criminally underused in the tournament in Japan. The decision to exclude him from the squad for the New Zealand game was a questionable one at the time and looks even worse in retrospect.</p>
      <p>He scored an absolute beauty of a try this evening, scorching the Ospreys defence out wide. A special mention also has to go to prop Jeremy Loughman who produced a cracking pass to set the move in motion.</p>

      <p>In a tough looking group that also features Saracens and Racing 92, this is the ideal start for Munster. Coach Johann van Graan will be hugely impressed with the performance, especially the endeavour to secure the bonus point after the clock had ticked into the red.</p>
      <p>They host the French side next week in a game that will see Simon Zebo and Donnacha Ryan return to Thomond Park. A win in that one would put them well on their way to securing a spot in the quarter finals.</p>
