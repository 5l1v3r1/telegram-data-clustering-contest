        <b>Chelsea teenage sensation Callum Hudson-Odoi is not bothered by the strict player fines at the club under manager Frank Lampard. </b>
      </p>
      <p>Players are made to pay as high as £20,000 for being late at training and £500 for every minute of being late at team meetings.</p>
      <p>If a player does not report an injury, he pays as much as  £10,000.</p>
      <p>However, Hudson-Odoi says players respect the fines and do their part in abiding by the rules.</p>
      <p>"To be fair, we have a couple of fines where it's pretty strict and we have to stick by it," says the 19-year old.</p>
      <p>"But even if there weren't fines, we would still be on point.</p>
      <p>"All of us are very on time with everything that we do.</p>
      <p>"We're very positive about everything we do. If there is a fine, we will pay it.</p>
      <p>"For the fines, we don't really look into it because we are always on time for what we do so it's OK. It's there but we're all good about it."</p>
