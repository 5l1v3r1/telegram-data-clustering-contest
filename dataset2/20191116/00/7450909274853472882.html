Waiting to challenge him is <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Jan-Blachowicz-25821">Jan Blachowicz</a>, who is coming off the biggest win of his career having knocked out former UFC middleweight champion <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Luke-Rockhold-23345">Luke Rockhold</a>. As they prepare to clash this weekend for UFC Fight Night 164, here are some of the numbers that define their respective careers.</p>
      <h3>Octagon experience</h3>
      <p>After a successful campaign at KSW, wherein he captured the light heavyweight title and won its 2010 light heavyweight tournament, Blachowicz got the call from the UFC and officially made his debut on Oct. 4, 2014. He was pitted against <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Ilir-Latifi-40207">Ilir Latifi</a>, whom he knocked out less than two minutes into the first round to complete a six-fight winning streak. In his next fight, he was derailed by <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Jimi-Manuwa-37528">Jimi Manuwa</a>, but he did manage to get his revenge on Manuwa in their rematch. Blachowicz has since won and lost against other top-quality opponents, including the likes of Rockhold, <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Alexander-Gustafsson-26162">Alexander Gustafsson</a> and <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Jared-Cannonier-78628">Jared Cannonier</a>. In all, his UFC record stands at 7-5.<br/><br/>Souza arrived in the UFC two years prior to Blachowicz’s debut, as he tapped out <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Chris-Camozzi-17224">Chris Camozzi</a> with a first-round submission on May 18, 2013. After that successful debut, Jacare would win four more fights before dropping a hard-fought split decision to <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Yoel-Romero-60762">Yoel Romero</a>. Jacare would go on to lose three more times inside the Octagon, but throughout his UFC tenure he has remained a top contender. At present, his UFC record is 9-4.</p>
      <h3>Knockout rate</h3>
      <p>Souza owns eight victories by KO or TKO, which translates to a 31 percent knockout rate. He’s starched a bunch of tough opposition, including <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Chris-Weidman-42804">Chris Weidman</a>, <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Vitor-Belfort-156">Vitor Belfort</a>, <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Yushin-Okami-5569">Yushin Okami</a> and <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Derek-Brunson-68494">Derek Brunson</a> twice. Blachowicz, for his part, owns six wins by KO or TKO, two of which occurred in the UFC, which translates to a 25 percent knockout rate. In addition to Rockhold, Blachowicz also stopped <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Ilir-Latifi-40207">Ilir Latifi</a>. But unlike Souza, who was knocked out by <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Robert-Whittaker-45132">Robert Whittaker</a>, Blachowicz has never been starched by anyone in the Octagon.</p>
      <h3>Submission rate</h3>
      <p>Blachowicz is a jiu-jitsu black belt under <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Joe-Moreira-126">Joe Moreira</a>. He’s won nine fights by submission, most of which occurred in KSW, which makes for a 38 percent submission rate. His victims in the UFC are <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Nikita-Krylov-110937">Nikita Krylov</a> and <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Devin-Clark-72777">Devin Clark</a>. As good as he is on the ground, though, Souza is still the superior grappler. The multi-titled jiu-jitsu specialist and black belt under Henrique Machado boasts 14 tapout triumphs, which makes for a 54 percent submission rate.</p>
      <h3>Losses by stoppage</h3>
      <p>Souza has lost seven times and has been stopped on three occasions. In his very first professional fight, Jacare was finished by the much more experienced <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Jorge-Patino-1015">Jorge Patino</a>, who then had a record of 19-5-1 (1 NC). He was also stopped by <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Gegard-Mousasi-7466">Gegard Mousasi</a> in Dream and by <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Luke-Rockhold-23345">Luke Rockhold</a> in Strikeforce.<br/><br/>Blachowicz has eight defeats on his resume, and, just like Souza, he has been stopped three times. In the UFC, he was finished by <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Thiago-Santos-90021">Thiago Santos</a>, while, in KSW, he was finished by <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Rameau-Thierry-Sokoudjou-17010">Rameau Thierry Sokoudjou</a> and <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Andre-Fyeet-10189">Andre Fyeet</a>.</p>
