      <p>It appears that multiple 2K-related social media accounts were hacked on Friday night. The <a href="https://twitter.com/Ronnie2K">Twitter account of Ronnie 2K</a> aka Ronnie Singh the Digital Brand Manager for the NBA 2K series, and the official <a href="https://www.facebook.com/2K/">2K Facebook page</a> were the targets as hackers posted offensive material on the accounts.Racial slurs, and other unfortunate posts littered the timelines of the accounts’ millions of followers. The 2K Twitter and the WWE 2K Twitter account posted the following message in acknowledgment of the situation.</p>
      <p>Ronnie 2K’s account later posted a similar message:</p>
      <p>Many have experienced their social media accounts being hacked, but this is a bit different. The 2K brand reaches millions of people globally and it’s a less-than-ideal way for the publisher to head into the weekend. The concept is pretty scary for anyone, but even more dangerous for businesses of this size that may also have sensitive and/or proprietary information.</p>
      <p>Some members of the NBA and WWE 2K community have been unhappy with the performance of the newest versions from those series. Some of the messages reference performance issues, but the motive for the attack is still unclear.</p>
      <p>Look for updates on the situation as they become available.</p>
