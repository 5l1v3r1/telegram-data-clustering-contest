      <p>Pawar has convened a meeting of the NCP's core committee in Pune on Sunday, which makes it difficult for him to reach Delhi in time, party sources said on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Earlier, sources in both the parties had said that Pawar and Gandhi may meet on Sunday.</p>
      <p>"The core committee meeting will begin in Pune at 4 pm. After that Pawar will head to Delhi in the evening. So the meeting with Sonia Gandhi seems unlikely," sources said.</p>
      <p>The core committee may discuss portfolio allocation in the possible coalition government of NCP, Congress and Shiv Sena, sources said.</p>
      <p>Pawar is expected to meet senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel on Monday or Tuesday to discuss government formation, they added.</p>
      <p>"A meeting with Sonia Gandhi may happen later," they said.</p>
      <p>Allies Congress and NCP have worked out a common minimum program with the Sena for government formation.</p>
      <p>Maharashtra is under President's rule since November 12 after the BJP-Sena alliance fell apart over the issue of sharing of chief minister's post.</p>
