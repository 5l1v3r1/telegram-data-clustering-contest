      <h1>James Holzhauer holds off Emma Boettcher, wins 'Jeopardy!' Tournament of Champions</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T00:59:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 00:59</time> by <a rel="author">David Purdum</a></address>
      <p>James Holzhauer, who garnered national attention this spring on "Jeopardy!" with a prolific run, won the game show's Tournament of Champions during Friday's episode, fending off rival Emma Boettcher to capture the $250,000 first prize.</p>
      <p>Holzhauer, a 35-year-old Las Vegas sports bettor, won $2.46 million during a 32-game winning streak. That streak ended in early June at the hands of Boettcher, <a href="https://www.espn.com/chalk/story/_/id/26889159/holzhauer-run-jeopardy-ends-shy-record">who remains the only contestant ever to beat him</a>.</p>
      <p>The rematch began Thursday with the first of two contests in the Tournament of Champions finals, and it wasn't decided until Final Jeopardy on Friday.</p>
      <p>Holzhauer entered Friday with a sizable $22,926 lead over Boettcher, a librarian from Chicago. Boettcher cut into Holzhauer's lead during the Double Jeopardy round and was in striking distance going into Final Jeopardy.</p>
      <p>The final clue from the category International Disputes: "A dispute over Etorofu, Habomai, Kunashiri &amp; Shikotan has kept these 2 countries from ever signing a WWII peace treaty."</p>
      <p>Holzhauer wagered $9,812, while Boettcher wagered $17,000. Both answered correctly with "What are Japan and Russia?" Holzhauer prevailed with $76,923 to Boettcher's $65,000.</p>
      <p>"I had to get Final [Jeopardy] right to avoid a last-second defeat," Holzhauer told ESPN in an email Friday. "Luckily, it was a question about Japan, and my Granny can rest easy knowing that I haven't forgotten my heritage."</p>
      <p>Holzhauer's career winnings on "Jeopardy!" now total $2,712,216, the third most in the show's history, behind only Brad Rutter ($4,688,436) and Ken Jennings ($3,370,700).</p>

      <p>Boettcher took home $100,000 for second place in the Tournament of Champions, and Francois Barcomb, a high school physics teacher from New York, won $50,000 for finishing third.</p>
      <p>"Everyone played great, especially Emma, whose $65,000 total was more than anyone had ever scored in a ToC final before," Holzhauer said. "I think the big takeaway is just how great a competitor she is, proving definitively that her win against me was no fluke."</p>
      <p>Holzhauer was quick on the buzzer during Friday's game, buzzing in first better than 54% of the time, according to community site <a href="https://thejeopardyfan.com/2019/11/final-jeopardy-11-15-2019.html">thejeopardyfan.com</a>. He correctly answered 30 of 33 clues, but Boettcher hung tough and answered all 18 of her clues correctly. She made a big move in Double Jeopardy, successfully going all-in on a Daily Double and surpassing Holzhauer for the day.</p>
      <p>Five clues later, Holzhauer misfired on a Daily Double of his own, losing $8,615 and putting Boettcher in position to pull out the win in Final Jeopardy. Holzhauer nailed Final Jeopardy, though, thwarting the comeback and adding to his legacy.</p>
      <p>During his captivating run in the spring, Holzhauer authored the 16 highest single-game scores in Jeopardy's 35 seasons and 23 of the top 27 overall. His peak performance came on the April 9 episode, when he won a record $131,127. He appeared on SportsCenter and received a key to the city for Las Vegas. Even <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ne/new-england-patriots">New England Patriots</a> quarterback <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2330/tom-brady">Tom Brady</a> tweeted about Jeopardy James.</p>
      <p>"I strongly suspect this was not my last appearance on 'Jeopardy!'" Holzhauer said. "Stay tuned!"</p>
      <p>He said he has been back working as a professional bettor during football season and isn't sure what's next for him.</p>
      <p>"Fingers crossed that I may be back on TV again next year," Holzhauer said.</p>
