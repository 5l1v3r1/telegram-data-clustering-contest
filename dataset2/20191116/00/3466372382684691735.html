      <p>The missile has a strike range of 2000 km, the sources said soon after it blasted off from a mobile launcher at theÂ Launch Complex-4 of the Integrated Test Range, the sources said.</p>
      <p>'Agni-II', an intermediate range ballistic missile has already been inducted into the armed forces.</p>
      <p>A defence official said this was the first time that the sophisticated missile was test-fired at night.</p>
      <p>The entire trajectory of the trial was tracked by a battery of sophisticated radars, telemetry observation stations, electro-optic instruments and two naval ships located near the impact point in the down range area of Bay of Bengal, Defence Research and Development Organisation sources said.</p>
      <p>The 20-metre long two stage ballistic missile has a launch weight of 17 tonnes and can carry a payload of 1,000 kg over a distance of 2000 km, the sources said.</p>
      <p>The two stage missile equipped with advanced high accuracy navigation system, was guided by a novel state-of-the-art command and control system and propelled by solid rocket propellant system, the defence official said.</p>
      <p>The 2000 plus km range surface to surface missile has already been inducted and is part of countries arsenal for strategic deterrence. It was launched as a regular exercise undertaken by the armed forces, he said.</p>
      <p>Saturday's test was carried out by the specially formed Strategic Forces Command of the army with logistic support from the DRDO.</p>
      <p>'Agni-II' was developed by Advanced Systems Laboratory along with other DRDO laboratories and integrated by the Bharat Dynamics Limited, Hyderabad, the sources said.</p>
      <p>'Agni-11' is part of the Agni series of missiles which includes Agni-I with a 700 km range, Agni-III with a 3,000 km range, Agni-IV and Agni-V both having long range capabilities.</p>
      <p>The first test-firing of the prototype of Agni-II missile was carried out on April 11, 1999. On May 17 2010, the trial of nuclear-capable Agni-II ballistic missile with a range of 2,000 km was conducted by the Special Strategic Command Force from the ITR before it was made operational by the army.</p>
      <p>The last trial was conducted on February 20, 2018 from the same base.</p>
