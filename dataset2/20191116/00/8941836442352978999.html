      <p>RENO, Nev. (AP) - Nineteen unvaccinated students were forced to temporarily unenroll from a Reno high school to avoid exposure during an outbreak of whooping cough.</p>
      <p>Unenrolling during the disease’s 21-day incubation period allows the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/damonte-ranch-high-school/">Damonte Ranch High School</a> students to avoid being classified as chronically absent.</p>
      <p>The 19 affected students claimed a religious exemption from the vaccine for whooping cough. The Washoe County Health Department says they should avoid going to school until 21 days after the last student was diagnosed.</p>
