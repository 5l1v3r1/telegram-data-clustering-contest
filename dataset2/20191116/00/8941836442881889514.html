      <p>LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) - Fred Hoiberg was pleased he got his first win at Nebraska, but he was happier with how his Cornhuskers played in building a 31-point first half lead on the way to defeating South Dakota State 90-73.</p>
      <p>“It sure beats what happens in the other two,” Hoiberg said. “It’s great to get that first one.”</p>
      <p>The Huskers got the win for the first-year coach by playing at the high tempo that has characterized Hoiberg’s teams at Iowa State and the Chicago Bulls.</p>

      <p>“To come out here and establish the tempo and the pace where we wanted to have it is an important thing in a game like this,” Hoiberg said. “We allowed them to dictate tempo in the second half. But for us, especially in that first half, it was a thing of beauty.”</p>
      <p>That thing was flying up the floor. It was fun for fans to watch.</p>

      <p>Nebraska (1-2) struggled to score its first two games, but came out hot, hitting 60 percent of its shots in the first 15 minutes of the game. South Dakota State (3-2) hit just one of its first 10 shots, falling behind 12-2 when Nebraska’s Haanif Cheatam hit a fast-break layup five minutes into the game.</p>
      <p>The Huskers put the game out of reach with a 19-2, four-minute run, to lead 45-14 on Yvan Ouedraogo’s putback layup with 4:50 left in the half.</p>
      <p>Nebraska led by 24 at halftime. South Dakota State trailed by at least 20 until midway through the second half and got no closer than the 17-point final margin.</p>
      <p>“Coach really preached on pace,” Dachon Burke said. “Nobody in the country can run with us. We picked it up and got the win.”</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>Nebraska improved its shooting percentage over the first two games, hitting 49% of its shots, and outrebounded its opponent for the first time this season.</p>
        <p>“We were definitely in tune,” said Cam Mack, who led Nebraska with a career-high 24 points. “I like where we are now. But we have to keep going for sure, for sure.”</p>
        <p>South Dakota State coach Eric Henderson said his team needs to learn a lesson from the loss</p>
        <p>“What we can learn is we have to play a full 40 minutes,” Henderson said. “You have to be ready from the tip and ready to compete and fight, especially on the road against a team as hungry as Nebraska was to get a win. You have to have a high level of compete for 40 minutes, and I thought we did for moments, especially in the second half.”</p>
        <p>Burke and Cheatam had 17 points each for Nebraska. Kevin Cross scored 10.</p>
        <p>Douglas Wilson had 15 points to lead South Dakota State. Brandon Key had 12 points and Trey Buchanan had 11 points.</p>
        <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
        <p>South Dakota State: The Jackrabbits looked like a tired team playing their third road game in a week. They had traveled to California for a double-overtime win against CSU Bakersfield and a loss to USC on Tuesday before coming to Lincoln Friday.</p>
        <p>Nebraska: The Huskers scored just 47 points in their season opening loss to UC Riverside. They had 51 at the half Friday. The win allowed Nebraska to avoid its first 0-3 start since the 1980-81 season.</p>
