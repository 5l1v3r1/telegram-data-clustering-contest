      <h1>This Might Be The Best Week For ‘Star Wars’ Fans In 36 Years</h1>

      <p>We are living in strange times, one where Disney now owns <i>Star Wars</i> (and pretty much everything else), which has resulted in a fresh wave of content, really the “third era” of the series, past the original trilogy and then Lucas’s prequel trilogy.This week, however, might be one that I’m willing to declare the best overall week for <i>Star Wars</i> fans in 36 years, since <i>Return of the Jedi </i>debuted in theaters back in 1983.</p>
      <p>Why? In the span of four days, we have had the release of the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/11/15/why-are-we-getting-short-27-minute-episodes-of-the-mandalorian-on-disney-plus/">first two episodes</a> of <i>The Mandalorian</i> on Disney Plus, and the release of Respawn’s <i>Jedi: Fallen Order</i> video game.</p>
      <p>Both are excellent, in their respective mediums. Truly, truly excellent.</p>
      <p><i>The Mandalorian</i> is the first live action <i>Star Wars</i> series ever, and has attracted top-tier talent from Jon Favreau to Dave Filoni to Pedro Pascal to bring it to life. Yesterday’s episode in particular, where The Mandalorian spars with Jawas, was probably some of the best onscreen <i>Star Wars</i> content I have seen in eons. The series is fantastic, and it has energized the fanbase almost universally, which is unusual in an era when a sect of vocal fans really hate almost everything about the Disney era of the franchise.</p>

      <p><i>Jedi: Fallen Order</i> is from Respawn, who made <i>Titanfall</i> and <i>Apex Legends</i>, and is shaping up to be an all-time great <i>Star Wars</i> title, fitting into the new-era canon nicely while <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/11/16/jedi-fallen-order-is-definitely-babys-first-dark-souls-but-in-a-good-way/">emulating the best aspects of God of War and Dark Souls</a> to be a challenging, engaging adventure, and one that many fans were not expecting, given EA’s handling of the <i>Star Wars</i> license as of late.</p>
      <p>Between these two releases, I genuinely believe this might be the best single week for <i>Star Wars</i> fans since ROTJ.</p>
      <p>The prequel releases were huge cultural events at the time, but that were mostly letdowns for fans.</p>
      <p>The release of <i>The Force Awakens</i> was another big moment for the series, but felt too much like it was retreading old ground when all was said and done.</p>
      <p><i>The Last Jedi</i> is probably the most divisive movie in franchise history (I think it’s great) and has been a warring ground for fans to this day.</p>
      <p><i>Rogue One</i> and <i>Solo</i> were standalone adventures that were very good and okay respectively.</p>
      <p><i>The Clone Wars</i> and <i>Rebels</i> are both solid animated shows, albeit with much smaller fanbses than the films, and I’m not sure you can pick one weekly episode that was a “huge” moment for the series as a whole.</p>
      <p>Some of the best <i>Star Wars</i> video games of all time are the likes of <i>KOTOR</i> and <i>Jedi Knight</i>, yet they weren’t released in the same week as any incredible SW onscreen content.</p>

      <p>You may even not really like <i>Return of the Jedi</i> that much, but it was the end of the first era, and to me, I really do think that the quality of both <i>The Mandalorian</i> and <i>Fallen Order</i> make for some of the best, most substantive <i>Star Wars</i> content that’s been put out in a single week since the original trilogy. We’ll see how each stacks up individually in the longer history of the series down the road (we have six more <i>Mandalorian</i> episodes to go, for one), but for now? It’s a great time to be a <i>Star Wars</i> fan after a few hit or miss years, and a few desolate decades before that.</p>
