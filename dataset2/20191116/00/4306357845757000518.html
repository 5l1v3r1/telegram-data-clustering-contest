      <h3>Hector Bellerin’s agent has revealed that the defender “likes Italy” but has suggested there is not much chance of him leaving Arsenal any time soon.</h3>
      <p>The right-back has only just returned to action from a long spell on the sidelines with a serious injury and he is just getting back into the swing of things with the Gunners.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old made his first Premier League appearance of the season last weekend when he played the full 90 minutes in Arsenal’s 2-0 loss to Leicester City at the King Power Stadium.</p>
      <p>Bellerin is under contract at Arsenal until the summer of 2023 and Gunners fans will be hoping to see him return to top form for the north London side in the coming weeks and months.</p>
      <p>Now, his agent Alberto Botines has suggested that his client would be open to a move to Serie A in the future, but suggested that a switch is not likely to happen any time soon.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview quoted by <a href="https://www.football-italia.net/146441/agent-italian-club-wanted-bellerin">Football Italia</a>, Botines said: “At the moment, he’s focused on the team’s commitments.</p>
      <p>“He comes from a bad injury and is returning to his usual level. He likes Italy, there’s already been interest from an Italian club but I can’t reveal it.</p>
      <p>“He has a long contract and it won’t be easy to take him away from Arsenal, he’s their vice-captain.</p>
      <p>“We’ll see how the season goes.”</p>
      <p>Arsenal will return to Premier League action after the international break when they host Southampton at The Emirates.</p>
      <p>The north London side are aiming to try and break back into the top four this season but they currently find themselves sixth in the table.</p>
