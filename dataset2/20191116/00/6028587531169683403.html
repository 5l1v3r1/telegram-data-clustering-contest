        <b>WWE Friday Night SmackDown Results: Friday, November 15, 2019</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Opening Segment Featuring Baron Corbin, Dolph Ziggler and Robert Roode</b>
      </p>
      <p>My only explanation for WWE’s commitment to this chihuahua mascot gimmick is that it must have been expensive. Having said that, I always felt Swagger’s Soaring Eagle should have had a much longer run so it’s good to see WWE go back to this well.</p>
      <p>Robert Roode can serve as an inspiration to the NXT invaders that after reaching the highest of highs at Full Sail University, a bright future lies ahead as King Corbin’s goon.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Shorty G and Mustafa Ali def. Dolph Ziggler and Robert Roode</b>
      </p>
      <p>The good thing about Shorty G teaming with Mustafa Ali is he gets a reminder that there is always a chance WWE can change your name back to its original form.</p>
      <p>Shorty G and Mustafa Ali could make a potentially phenomenal tag team as long as Ali doesn’t have to dress up like a male cheerleader.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Bray Wyatt Reveals New Universal Championship on Firefly Fun House</b>
      </p>
      <p>WWE did not have to pander to all the dummies who felt that just because a belt was red it belonged on Raw. For crying out loud, it’s called the <i>Universal </i>Championship<i>.</i></p>
      <p>The WWE Universal Championship is on pace to change colors more times than when The Ultimate Warrior had it.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Drew Gulak and The B-Team Confront Braun Strowman</b>
      </p>
      <p>WWE pairing Drew Gulak with The B-Team should tell him everything he needs to know about how they view him.</p>
      <p>In an alternate—more delightful—universe, this whole rivalry between Drew Gulak and Braun Strowman would build to a match where Drew Gulak fluked his way to a win and never shut up about it.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The New Day and The Revival Battle to a No Contest</b>
      </p>
      <p>Big E idly waiting for his opponent’s entrance is more entertaining than 80% of the entire roster.</p>
      <p>After chasing off The Undisputed Era, WWE Superstars were heard saying “we run this!” and how nobody is better than WWE. For some reason, I don’t think that message was meant for NXT.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Heavy Machinery def. Kevin Tibbs and Kipp Stevens</b>
      </p>
      <p>The more Otis danced around while performing a striptease, the weaker The Undisputed Era looked for running from them.</p>
      <p>Per WWE tradition, Michael Cole made fun of the names of the jobbers. He said “Tibbs and Stevens” sounded like a buddy cop movie. It wasn’t funny, but it might have been the funniest thing Michael Cole has ever said.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Dana Brooke, Nikki Cross, Sasha Banks and Carmella def. Dakota Kai, Rhea Ripley, Tegan Nox and Mia Yim</b>
      </p>
      <p>This match just confirms that every match should be competed inside a Steel Cage until Survivor Series.</p>
      <p>How did Bayley get flexed out of this equation?</p>
      <p>It was around this time that Michael Cole officially said the words “CM Punk” on WWE commentary for the first time in five years. What a world we live in.</p>
      <p>Fans were silent for much of this match until Sasha Banks tagged in.</p>
      <p>Rhea Ripley was awesome in this match.</p>
      <p>On one hand, Team NXT losing is yet another loss on the main roster that they couldn’t afford. On the other hand, Dakota Kai taking the pinfall plays perfectly into the storyline of Dakota Kai not being good enough to be on Rhea Ripley’s team for War Games.</p>
      <p>
        <b>MizTV Featuring Bray Wyatt and Daniel Bryan</b>
      </p>
      <p>After throwing a t-shirt into the crowd and hamming it up for the Philly crowd, babyface Miz quickly defaulted to heel Miz the second Daniel Bryan wouldn’t answer his questions.</p>
      <p>Daniel Bryan spoke proudly about his combination of mental instability and passion. In real life, that combination usually leads to prison time.</p>
      <p>Judging by this segment, Daniel Bryan very well may be the heel in this storyline.</p>
