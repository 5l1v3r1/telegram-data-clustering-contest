      <h1>How We Would Operate At Bayelsa, Kogi Governorship Poll – ICPC</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T00:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Faderera Falade</a></address>
      <p>The Nigerian anti-graft agency, <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/icpc/"><u><b>ICPC</b> </u></a>has said the Saturday’s governorship elections in Kogi and Bayelsa states would be monitored by it.</p>
      <p>This was disclosed by the commission yesterday through a statement it made available to newsmen.</p>
      <p>The agency said it would watch out for incidences of vote-buying and selling, as well as other corruption-related acts.</p>
      <p>According to the commission, the infractions contravene sections 8 and 9 in addition to other relevant provisions of the Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Act, 2000.</p>
      <p>The agency said the monitoring exercise was necessitated, following the request by Prof. <b><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/mahmood-yakubu/"><u>Mahmood Yakubu</u></a></b>, the Chairman of the <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/inec/"><u><b>Independent National Election Commission (INEC)</b></u></a>, that it participates in ridding the electoral processes in Nigeria of corrupt practices.</p>
      <p>He further noted that “<i>This intervention is also in furtherance of ICPC’s current strategy of engaging in exercises that have macro rather than micro impact on various sectors of the country for the benefit of the generality of citizens as it is doing with Constituency Projects tracking and highway corruption where sundry acts of corruption are being tackled with commendable results.</i></p>
      <p>The commission said that it has directed its operatives to deal appropriately with perpetrators of any corrupt act, in accordance with the law, no matter their social status in both gubernatorial elections.</p>
