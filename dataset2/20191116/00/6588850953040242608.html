      <p>President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo has called on African countries to help push the frontier of entrepreneurial development to be able to grow their economies.<br/><br/>Addressing the opening session of the African Netpreneur Conference, an initiative launched by Jack Ma to support African entrepreneurs, President Akufo-Addo said entrepreneurship was one of the most important drivers of economic growth globally.<br/><br/>“The truth is that successful economies depend on entrepreneurs to run successful businesses. We need to push vigorously the culture of entrepreneurship so we can grow our economies to become prosperous,” he said.<br/><br/>The Jack Ma Foundation is hosting the inaugural full-day Africa Netpreneur Summit in Ghana for African and global entrepreneurs, investors, educators, and leaders to discuss how best to push entrepreneurship and the digital economy across the Continent.<br/><br/>Guest speakers will include Ban Ki-moon, Former UN Secretary-General and Co-chair of the Ban Ki-moon Centre for Global Citizens.<br/><br/>The conference will be followed by the “Africa’s Business Heroes” event.<br/><br/>President Akufo-Addo said Ghana was humbled by her choice as host of the inaugural Netpreneur Summit and the African Heroes Business forum.<br/><br/>It was time to take entrepreneurship seriously and there could not be a better forum to demonstrate that than the Netpreueur forum, he said.<br/><br/>The development of entrepreneurial talent is key and constitute a very powerful tool to development and addressing the challenge of unemployment, especially youth unemployment.<br/><br/>He said the conference came at a time when Africa’s youth population was projected to be a quarter of the world’s population by 2035 and their empowerment through access to education and enabling environment was important. <br/><br/>“Africa today has a unique opportunity engendered by the globalisation of technology to achieve quality development gains by leveraging technology.

They solve problems,” he said, adding that he was encouraged by the African young entrepreneurs trying to solve the problems in their communities “and that is the hope.” Featured Video</p>
