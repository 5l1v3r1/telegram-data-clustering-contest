        <b>Black Meteors forward Kwabena Owusu will miss Cordoba CF's segunda B games against UCAM Murcia and Merida AD.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 22-year old will miss the games due to his involvement at the CAF U-23 Cup of Nations with the Black Meteors of Ghana.</p>
      <p>Owusu netted a brace against Mali to keep Ghana in the competition, which leaves the Black Meteors fight for a ticket to Tokyo 2020.</p>
      <p>The Black Meteors will face Ivory Coast in the semi finals on Tuesday and a win will guarantee the team a place in the Olympics next year.</p>
      <p>However, a defeat will mean the team will have to play and third and four place match to determine if they will be part of the Olympics.</p>
      <p>Owusu has played all three group games for the Black Meteors after starting two and coming off the bench in the game against Mali.</p>
