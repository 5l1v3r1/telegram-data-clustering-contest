Expect him to do everything in his power to extend his winning streak and put himself closer to the Top 10. In his quest for big name opposition, he will have to get past the tough and durable <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Jared-Gordon-74057">Jared Gordon</a>. For a preview of this exciting <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/events/UFC-Fight-Night-164-Blachowicz-vs-Jacare-76601">UFC Fight Night 164</a> matchup, take a look at the numbers below.</p>
      <h3>Active winning streak</h3>
      <p>After losing to <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Paul-Felder-68205">Paul Felder</a> at UFC 218, Oliveira piled up five consecutive victories, all of which were finishes. He submitted <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Clay-Guida-8184">Clay Guida</a>, <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Christos-Giagos-68130">Christos Giagos</a>, <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Jim-Miller-14463">Jim Miller</a> and <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/David-Teymur-163937">David Teymur</a> and knocked out <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Nik-Lentz-15058">Nik Lentz</a>. Gordon, on the other hand, recently picked up his first win since losing to <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Diego-Ferreira-26358">Diego Ferreira</a> and <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Joaquim-Silva-146291">Joaquim Silva</a> in succession. At UFC on ESPN 3, he used his superior wrestling to edge out <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Dan-Moret-52514">Dan Moret</a> via a unanimous decision.</p>
      <h3>Octagon experience</h3>
      <p>Oliveira has been fighting in the UFC since 2010 when he impressed fans with a 41-second submission of <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Darren-Elkins-22094">Darren Elkins</a> at UFC on Versus 2. He followed that up with another masterful performance, tapping out <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Efrain-Escudero-16555">Efrain Escudero</a> in the third round. He was derailed by <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Jim-Miller-14463">Jim Miller</a> and <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Donald-Cerrone-15105">Donald Cerrone</a> after that, but throughout his career he has remained a bright prospect and a fierce opponent. To date, Oliveira has amassed an Octagon record of 15-8 (1 NC). Apart from those previously mentioned, he’s also faced the likes of <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Ricardo-Lamas-32051">Ricardo Lamas</a>, <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Anthony-Pettis-26627">Anthony Pettis</a> and <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Max-Holloway-38671">Max Holloway</a>.<br/><br/>Gordon made his UFC debut on June 25, 2017, at UFC Fight Night 112. Like Oliveira, he showed a lot of promise, scoring a second-round knockout over <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Michael-Quinones-250873">Michael Quinones</a>. In all, he has fought inside the Octagon five times, with a record of 3-2.</p>
      <h3>Knockout rate</h3>
      <p>Between the two lightweights, it’s Gordon who’s more inclined to land a fight-ending punch or kick. He’s done that six times in his career, which makes for a 40 percent knockout rate. Meanwhile, Oliveira has scored seven knockouts as a professional. With a total of 27 triumphs, he registers a 26 percent knockout rate. His most recent victory, over <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Nik-Lentz-15058">Nik Lentz</a> at UFC Fight Night 152, came via TKO.</p>
      <h3>Submission rate</h3>
      <p>Both Gordon and Oliveira are skilled on the ground, but it’s safe to say that the Brazilian is on a different level. In fact, he owns the record for the most submission wins in UFC history at 13. Overall, he’s tapped out 18 opponents, making for a 67 percent submission rate.<br/><br/>All the same, Gordon has some slick submissions himself. The <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Renzo-Gracie-290">Renzo Gracie</a> jiu-jitsu representative is a brown belt under John Danaher and owns two career submission wins. That’s a 13 percent submission rate for the man from Queens, New York.</p>
      <h3>UFC losses</h3>
      <p>Oliveira has lost eight times in the UFC. He was starched by <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Paul-Felder-68205">Paul Felder</a>, <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Max-Holloway-38671">Max Holloway</a>, <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Cub-Swanson-11002">Cub Swanson</a> and <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Donald-Cerrone-15105">Donald Cerrone</a>, tapped out by <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Ricardo-Lamas-32051">Ricardo Lamas</a>, <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Anthony-Pettis-26627">Anthony Pettis</a> and <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Jim-Miller-14463">Jim Miller</a> and decisioned by <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Frankie-Edgar-14204">Frankie Edgar</a>. Meanwhile, Gordon has lost twice in the Octagon, falling victim to the fists of both <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Diego-Ferreira-26358">Diego Ferreira</a> and <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Joaquim-Silva-146291">Joaquim Silva</a>.</p>
