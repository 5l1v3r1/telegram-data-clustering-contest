      <p><b>The club's statement contradicted some reports</b> that indicated the letter was sent directly to Conte.</p>
      <p>"In relation to the news published today, <b>Antonio Conte has not personally received any threatening letter,</b>" the statement said. "Consequently, he did not go in person to file a complaint. <b>It was the club that received a letter</b> and, as per the practice in this kind of situation, proceeded to contact the competent authorities."</p>
      <p><b>Inter's next fixture sees them travel to Torino</b> for a Serie A clash on November 23.</p>
