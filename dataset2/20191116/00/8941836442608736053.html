      <p>WACO, Texas (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/baylor/">Baylor</a> coach Scott Drew already expected a tough game against an experienced opponent that won 24 games last season. The Bears were also playing without their preseason All-Big 12 forward.</p>
      <p>Jared Butler scored 15 points, Freddie Gillespie had 11 points and 11 rebounds, and three other players scored in double figures for No. 24 <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/baylor/">Baylor</a>, who without Tristan Clark beat Texas State 72-63 on Friday night.</p>
      <p>“It was great for our team to win a game where there’s pressure and where we had to focus and perform in the end,” Drew said. “Hopefully, we can build on that so we can do a little bit better in the last five minutes.”</p>

      <p>Even after <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/baylor/">Baylor</a> (2-1) had an 18-2 run early in the second half to go ahead to stay, and led by as many as 18 points, Texas State (2-2) cut the gap to 61-55 with 4 minutes left. That was after Nijal Pearson, who finished with 20 points, converted consecutive turnovers into 3-pointers.</p>
      <p>“They had two runs on us in the first half and second half. I was pleased with our guys making a spirited comeback on both occasions,” Texas State coach Danny Kaspar said. “But <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/baylor/">Baylor</a>’s very good on the perimeter. We played them without Clark and I know that’s a big loss.”</p>

      <p>Clark had a non-operative procedure on his knee this week. The junior forward was limited to 14 games last season because of a knee injury at the start of Big 12 play, but had played in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/baylor/">Baylor</a>’s first two games.</p>
      <p>Texas State trailed by 13 points about eight minutes into the game before finishing the first half with a 24-11 run to tie the game at 30-all. The Bobcats scored the last eight points of the half, with four different players making baskets.</p>
      <p>DeShawn Davidson made the first basket after halftime to put Texas State ahead before <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/baylor/">Baylor</a> scored nine in a row to ignite that 18-2 run.</p>
      <p>“I think a lot of inexperience once we get a lead either we get tired or we just don’t focus as much,” Drew said. “Time and score, we like to say a lot of times, but with young players it doesn’t always register.”</p>

        <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
