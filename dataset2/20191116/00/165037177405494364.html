      <p>On November 8, after learning that he was being called up by his national team, Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane said that Bale was <b>no longer injured</b>, but not available to play because, he indicated that, like the Colombian James Rodriguez, they did not train with the team.</p>
      <p>Training that Bale instead took part in days later for Wales as they prepared for their match against Azerbaijan.</p>
      <p>Now, 42 days after his last Madrid match, he returned in Baku, where<b> he started and was named captain</b> as Wales aim to qualify for Euro 2020.</p>
