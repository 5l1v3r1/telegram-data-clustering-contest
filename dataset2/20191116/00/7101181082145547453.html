      <p>To help you make the most out of the sale extravaganza, read up on all the details you need to know ahead of the event. </p>
      <h3>When Is Black Friday? </h3>
      <p>Black Friday officially starts on Nov. 29, the day after Thanksgiving. However, most retailers and brands will most likely begin their sales as early as Nov. 25, and extend to as long as <a href="https://www.etonline.com/cyber-monday-deals-2019-the-best-fashion-beauty-discounts-133943">Cyber Monday</a>, Dec. 2. </p>
      <h3>What Will Be on Sale? </h3>
      <p>Various fashion and beauty brands and retailers will be participating in Black Friday. Last year, major department stores like Nordstrom, Macy's, Walmart, Target and Bloomingdale's, along with e-commerce sites like Shopbop and Amazon, offered deals across categories. Brands that rarely go on sale such as Glossier, Reformation, Reebok and NARS had site-wide discounts. Others expected to be discounted are Aritzia, Express, Topshop, Ulta, Charlotte Tilbury, Birchbox, Tatcha, Peter Thomas Roth, Ann Taylor, ASOS and so many more. </p>
      <h3>How Do I Score the Best Deals? </h3>
      <p>We suggest you plan ahead! Before Thanksgiving week, we recommend you bookmark or save to cart all the items you are eyeing and check back to see if the brand or retailer has announced the sale. </p>
