      <p>Darcy Kuemper stopped 35 shots and slammed an opponent to the ice during a brawl in the second period, and the Arizona Coyotes beat the Calgary Flames 3-0 Saturday.</p>
      <p>After Calgary’s Johnny Gaudreau cross-checked Arizona’s Jason Demers late in the second period while Demers was down on the ice, Kuemper put the Flames’ Matthew Tkachuk in a headlock and flipped him off his feet. Tkachuk came up swinging and landed a few blows on Kuemper in a dustup that also included Calgary goaltender David Rittich barrelling in from the other side of the rink.</p>
      <p>The crowd chanted Kuemper’s name as he returned to the net. Three Flames and two Coyotes combined for 14 penalty minutes. Vinnie Hinostroza served Kuemper’s four-minute roughing penalty, and Rasmus Andersson sat for two minutes on Rittich’s behalf.</p>
      <p>Derek Stepan, Carl Soderberg and Lawson Crouse scored, and Arizona won for the third time in four games.</p>
      <p>Rittich stopped 22 shots, and Calgary lost its third straight.</p>
      <p>Stepan was in the right spot to knock down Rittich’s clearance at 6:35 of the second period. The attempted pass up the ice hit Stepan in the chest, and the puck came down to Stepan’s stick for a wrist shot.</p>
      <p>Stepan smiled sheepishly after his third goal of the season and first since Nov. 4 at Edmonton.</p>
      <p>Moments later, Soderberg scored off a pass from linemate Crouse after Phil Kessel got to a loose puck first and tapped it up the ice. It was Soderberg’s sixth goal of the season.</p>
      <p>The Coyotes’ best scoring opportunity of the first period came when at the 11:31 mark. Crouse passed to Soderberg for a shot from close range, but the attempt to stuff the puck into the net was unsuccessful as Rittich blocked it.</p>
      <p>Arizona also had back-to-back power plays at 13:03 and 14:59 of the first but were denied. The Coyotes’ power play is just 1 for its last 24 after going 0 for 4 Saturday.</p>
      <p>Crouse rolled in an empty-net goal with seven seconds to play to finish off the win.</p>
      <p>NOTES: Flames D TJ Brodie was scratched two days after a fainting and seizure-like episode in practice that led to him being hospitalized. Brodie didn’t make the trip and remained in Calgary for rest and recovery. … D Oliver Kylington, called up from AHL Stockton on Friday, started in Brodie’s place on the third line. … Arizona began a stretch of seven of the next eight games against Pacific Division opponents. … Kuemper and forward Nick Schmaltz played in their 200th career NHL games Saturday.</p>
