      <h2>A three-way fight for the win on Saturday in Valencia takes the title down to the final race</h2>

      <p>Eric Granado (Avintia Esponsorama Racing) converted pole position into his first victory of the year at the Gran Premio Motul de la Comunitat Valenciana. The Brazilian came out on top in a three-way scrap for the win which saw Hector Garzo (Tech 3 E-Racing) get the better of One Energy Racing’s Bradley Smith on the final lap.</p>

      <p>Smith got the initial getaway but it was soon the top three who were fighting for victory, with Cup standings leader Matteo Ferrari (Trentino Gresini MotoE) a couple of seconds off in P4. Granado got the better of Smith with two laps to go and with Garzo and Smith fighting tooth and nail to the line, Granado got a nice 0.5 buffer to claim Race 1 win in Valencia. With Ferrari finishing P4, the top three – and only riders able to claim the 2019 MotoE™ title - heading into the final race is as follows:</p>
      <p>
        <b>1. Ferrari – 85<br/>2. Garzo – 73 (+12)<br/>3. Smith – 64 (+21)</b>
      </p>
      <p>You don’t want to miss Race 2 on Sunday, which will get underway at the rescheduled time of 15:30 local time (GMT+1).</p>
