      <p><i>3 accidents, a horse euthanised and vandalism rock the Turf Club</i> <br/><br/>The winter racing season in Bengaluru started on an ominous note on Friday. Will To Win from lady trainer Parvati Byramji’s yard, a fancied contestant in the opening event, broke her leg and was later euthanised. Leading jockey Suraj Narredu astride Will To Win and Kiran Rai piloting Sir Piggot escaped unhurt while Srinath guiding the fortunes of the public choice Aceros hurt his hip and suffered a bleeding injury on his ankle. <br/><br/>Minutes later, all hell broke loose. Over 7,000 punters, angry with the stewards’ decision not to conduct an enquiry, demanded their money back, while a section of the crowd turned violent, damaging furniture and pelting televisions with stones. <br/><br/>Pradeep Chouhan, President of Jockeys Association of India (JAI) had sent a letter to the managing committee of the Bangalore Turf Club (BTC) on November 11, warning them that the racing track was not ready. It had been dug up to put sprinklers and was not adequately firm yet. Around 50 JAI members endorsed the letter and asked the club to conduct mock races before the season opened. But only one mock race was held despite jockeys and trainers saying that the track was risky. <br/><br/>Suraj Narredu later said, “My horse, Will To Win, lost her footing twice in the final furlong before the accident. Luckily I escaped without a serious injury. I have hurt my back. I may ride at Pune on Sunday if I’m fully fit,” said the ace jockey who is eight short of 2,000 winners, a big landmark in his career. <br/><br/>BTC chairman Vinod Sivappa said, “We will inspect the track with trainers and jockeys tomorrow and rectify the conditions if needed. We will conduct two mock races after taking remedial measures before we resume racing next week.”</p>

      <p>–Vinod Sivappa, BTC chairman<br/><br/><br/>The stewards later decided to cancel Saturday’s races, as jockeys were not willing to take a risk on the track. <br/><br/>A senior police officer said that the violence and vandalism began after three horses fell during the race on Friday. “When the club authorities did not call the race null and void and announced the winners immediately, the punters resorted to violence and vandalism. In order to prevent any untoward incidents, the police have asked the club not to hold the off course betting scheduled for Saturday and Sunday.” <br/><br/>High Grounds police have taken up a case against unknown men for causing violence and damaging property inside the club. The police have collected CCTV footage and are examining it.</p>
