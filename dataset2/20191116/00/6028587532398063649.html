      <h1>Watch Out For This Combo Scam</h1>

      <p>Scamsters are getting clever. Not only are they plying their trade online through “phishing” emails 24/7, they are combining their efforts with phone calls.Call it old school meets new school through cyberthievery. I know these kinds of things are happening since I monitor them every week by talking to police and consumer protection experts.</p>
      <p>First, let’s start with the phishing piece: Basically you get an email with a link asking your for personal information. It may start “Please confirm your account information...”</p>
      <p>It will look like it’s from a bank or credit card company, but it’s not. It’s a ruse to get you to supply your bank account or credit card number and other identifying information. Once you hand over that information, thieves will either get into your credit card account – or sell it to other thieves.</p>
      <p>Then there’s the old-fashioned approach: Just calling people on the phone. They will say they are from your bank, credit card company and even the IRS. They aren’t. They’re phishing for your personal data.</p>
      <p>The new hybrid model uses both techniques. Thieves will call <i>and </i>send emails. I know they’re doing this because it recently happened to a friend of mine. They tried to get into his bank, retirement account and even mortgage payment. And they kept on trying to steal his money over a month-long period.</p>
      <p>Moreover, thieves may be watching your social media posts to get an idea on where you bank, shop or what services you use. Then they will use this information to “target” you during a phone call or email. They want to keep you talking so that they get what they want.</p>
      <p>“Hackers may use what's known as social engineering to try and obtain or compromise information about you, which could then be used to gain access to something such as your bank account,” according to a recent <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/27/business/phishing-bank-scam-trnd/index.html">CNN.com piece</a>. “What that means is simple: they tricked you, or someone who knows you, to compromise your account.”</p>
      <p>How do you avoid these swindles? Don’t pick up on calls you don’t recognize, even if it’s on your smartphone. I must get a dozen calls like this a week.</p>
      <p>And, of course, don’t respond to any emails that request this information. Don’t even think about clicking on the links. Unless it’s something you requested, use your gut instinct.</p>
