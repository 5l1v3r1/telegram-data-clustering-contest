      <p>Every breakthrough, every invention that we depend on today, every societal movement that changed the world came about by someone defying the people who said it couldn’t be done.</p>
      <p>When then-24-year old Tracy Edwards decided to build the first all-female crew to do the grueling, life-threatening, nine-month long, 33,000-mile Whitbread Round The World yachting race, she faced naysayers and even doomsayers who said things like, “if you die, it’ll be bad PR for us.”</p>
      <p>But she pushed through anyway, “just figured it out,” built a team of talented but underestimated women sailors, and triumphed. As a result, she and her<a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/2398738/tracy-edwards-maiden-documentary"> “Maiden”</a> crew came in second overall and won the 2 most dangerous legs (of the race’s 6 legs) and became the first woman to be named Yachtsman of The Year.  </p>

      <p>The new documentary about their unlikely voyage, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8879946/">called “Maiden,”</a> directed by Alex Holmes, takes us literally onto the boat with them courtesy of onboard cameras that captured the whole journey. From Tracy’s decision to enter the race as the first all-female crew, to buying and rebuilding their second-hand boat, to completing the race (winning 2 of the 6 legs), to crossing the finish line, they were underestimated.</p>
      <p>Pushing through, they changed an industry forever, made history, and kicked open many doors for women, as well as forever altered the lives of Edwards and her “Maiden” crew.</p>
      <p>After seeing this powerful movie, I spoke with Tracy on my <a href="http://greenconnectionsradio.com/">podcast, Green Connections Radio,</a> about how she did it and here are key points for all of us:</p>
      <p>1.     <u>Identify what motivates you</u>: Edwards told me that “the injustice of being told (she) couldn’t do it propelled (her) forward.” What propels <i>you</i> forward?</p>
      <p>2.     <u>Figure out how to tap into your inner strength</u>: Edwards found that being furious at an injustice was what “pushed (her) buttons” and helped her tap into her inner strength.</p>
      <p>3.     <u>Realize that you know more than you think you do</u>: Having to figure out so many things on the boat in real time to literally survive, Edwards and her crew realized they knew way more than they had given themselves credit for.</p>

      <p>4.     <u>Turn a disadvantage into an advantage</u>: The crew of Maiden had to buy a second-hand boat and rebuild it from scratch, because that was all they could afford at the time. At first it seemed like another disadvantage, but as the race was under way, they came to understand that it was an advantage. Because they rebuilt the boat themselves, they knew every square inch of it and, therefore, could fix any problems quickly and well.</p>
      <p>5.     <u>Practice, practice, practice</u>: It was practicing with the camera that made the Maiden’s footage in the documentary so compelling, and it was practicing with their boat for a year of rebuilding it and getting it in the water that enabled them to develop teamwork and master the boat. That teamwork and mastery enabled them to effectively address any sailing issues that came up and to keep the same team for the whole race.</p>
      <p>6.     <u>Prepare for what might happen</u>:  In addition to preparing for the 33,000-mile race on the treacherous open ocean, the Maiden crew had to prepare for being a curiosity as the first and only all-female crew in the Whitbread. Foreseeing the press queries that would need to be managed, Edwards asked a prominent boating journalist to do their public relations, which turned out to be more valuable than they had imagined.</p>
      <p>(You can listen to my podcast interview with Nardia Haigh <a href="http://greenconnectionsradio.com/decision-making-in-7-steps-nardia-haigh-scenario-planning-book-author/">about scenario planning</a> to help prepare too, or read about it in my other <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanmichelson2/2019/11/02/how-to-prepare-for-any-potential-scenario--in-climate-business-careers-or-our-personal-lives/#1d9953896f73">Forbes blog</a>).</p>
      <p>7.     <u>Ask for what you need</u>: Edwards asked the World Sailing Association and experts she knew, as well as skippers from previous boats she had worked on, for help with anything they needed, from boat rebuilding issues to sponsorships.</p>
      <p>“Open yourself up to the universe and you will always find the right people in the right place at the right time,” Edwards told me was valuable advice her mother had given her while she was growing up, adding, “look around you and you will see the people you will need to meet.”</p>

      <p>One of those people was the late King Hussein of Jordan, who Edwards had met by happenstance when she was a cook on another boat in the Greek islands before she even thought about embarking on the Whitbread race.  He had come down to the galley to help with the dishes (really! Listen to <a href="http://greenconnectionsradio.com/">our interview</a>) and struck up a conversation with her that she said went on for “a long, long time” and</p>
      <p>he gave Edwards his phone number. They stayed in touch and he encouraged Edwards to do the Whitbread.  When Edwards was short about $900,000 to finish the boat and do the race, and was out of ideas for where to get the money, she reached out to him.  As a result, Royal Jordanian airlines sponsored their boat and King Hussein and Queen Noor actively supported them.</p>
      <p>8.     “<u>Keep moving forward, keep putting one foot in front of the other</u>”: Edwards insisted this is key. She said, “No matter even if you don’t have a direction, if you have no idea where you’re going, not a clue, move forwards, because….if you stand still, nothing will happen. If you keep moving forward, something will happen. You will see opportunities. You will see things on the horizon…. It’s never too late.”</p>

      <p><b>One of the most important things Edwards said was this</b>: “I learned that we are all capable of so much more than we think we are, until we push ourselves, adding, “We all have these reserves that I don’t think we use anymore…keep looking for those parts of yourself that you have ignored.”</p>
