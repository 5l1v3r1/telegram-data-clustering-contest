      <p>ORINDA, Calif. (AP) - Authorities in the San Francisco Bay Area are calling a shooting that left five dead during a <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/halloween-party/">Halloween party</a> at an <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/airbnb/">Airbnb</a> rental a “bloodbath,” where several partygoers were armed and some showed up looking for trouble.</p>
      <p>Contra Costa Sheriff David Livingston said Friday that he knows residents in the plush <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/san-francisco/">San Francisco</a> suburb of Orinda are on edge after the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/halloween-party/">massive party</a> on Oct. 31 and wanted to provide an update, although he could not yet say what sparked the shooting and who shot whom.</p>
      <p>Livingston said there is a wealth of evidence to process, including casings that littered the floors and countertops of the four-bedroom home with vaulted ceilings that hosted roughly 100 people that night.</p>

      <p>Livingston said that an altercation started in the kitchen of the house, and witnesses told investigators someone had tried to steal someone else’s property, which may have precipitated the shooting.</p>
      <p>Livingston said there were “multiple” shooters at the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/halloween-party/">party</a>.</p>
      <p>He said investigators have reviewed video from that night and saw people tucking guns into their pants as they slipped past a front-door security guard who was drinking from a bottle of Hennessy.</p>
      <p>He said some of the people went to the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/halloween-party/">party</a> “with intent of causing harm and conflict.”</p>
