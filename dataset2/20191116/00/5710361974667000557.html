      <h1>Upset at league, Kaepernick moves scheduled tryout</h1>

      <p>(Reuters) - Upset at what he called preconditions imposed by the National Football League, quarterback Colin Kaepernick moved his scheduled tryout on Saturday away from the Atlanta Falcons training facility.</p>
      <p>The former starting quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers is seeking a return to the NFL three years after his protests against racial injustice roiled the sport.</p>
      <p>Kaepernik, 32, accused the NFL of not acting in a forthright manner in organizing the workout and said the tryout would be held at another Atlanta location later on Saturday.</p>
      <p>"From the outset, Mr. Kaepernick requested a legitimate process and from the outset the NFL league office has not provided one," a statement said.</p>
      <p>"Most recently, the NFL has demanded that as a precondition to the workout, Mr. Kaepernick sign an unusual liability waiver that addresses employment-related issues and rejected the standard liability waiver from physical injury proposed by Mr. Kaepernick’s representatives."</p>
      <p>The statement said Kaepernick had requested all media be allowed into the workout to observe and film it.</p>
      <p>"The NFL denied this request,” it added</p>
      <p>The NFL was not immediately available for comment.</p>
