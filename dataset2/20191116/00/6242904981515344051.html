      </p>
      <p>Ekuban was sidelined for two months after he sustained a broken bone injury in training.</p>
      <p>The Ghana international was subsequently taken to Italy where he had a successful surgery. He stayed in the country and went through rehab under observation from experts.</p>
      <p>He has now recovered after doing some fitness work at the gym on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Ekuban after the training expressed delight with the progress he is making and declared that he can't wait to don the team's jersey again.</p>
      <p>"I miss the jersey to wear. As soon as possible to recover and I want to come back to our gorgeous fans. I had a hard time and very sad, but now it's all behind."Â said.</p>
      <p>He scored 5 goals in 7 matches and tallied 1 assist before the unfortunate injury.</p>
