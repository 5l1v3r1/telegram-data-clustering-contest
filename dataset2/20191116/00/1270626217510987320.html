      <p>Tailevu Province has the highest number of people serving time in prison.</p>
      <p>This was highlighted by Fiji Corrections Service Chaplain Reverend Josefa Tikonatabua during the talanoa session at the Tailevu Provincial Council meeting.</p>
      <p>Reverend Tikonatabua says 215 people are serving time in prison while 73 people are currently in the remand centres.</p>
      <p>Reverend Tikonatabua says they are working closely with the Tailevu Care Network, so the numbers can decrease.</p>
      <p>He urges the Tailevu Provincial Council committee that are part of the Tailevu Network Care to uplift their work and has also requested district representatives to address this issue during their district meetings.</p>
