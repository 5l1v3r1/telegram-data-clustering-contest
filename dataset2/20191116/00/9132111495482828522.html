      <p>Members of Ghana’s biggest opposition party, the National Democratic Congress (NDC), today, Saturday, 16 November 2019, undertook a nationwide weeding exercise in honour of their flag bearer Mr John Mahama who recently undertook a similar exercise in Accra, the national capital.</p>
      <p>Last week, the former President cleared overgrown weeds in the median of the road that leads to the Military Cemetery.</p>
      <p>Subsequently, statement signed by Mr Joshua Hamidu Akamba, the National Organiser of the NDC on Tuesday, 12 November said: “This is to bring to the attention of all constituency organisers that the party shall observe a nationwide weeding and clean-up up exercise on Saturday, 16 November 2019 in all regional and district capitals in honour of the flag bearer of the NDC, H.E. John Dramani Mahama.</p>
      <p>“Last week, the flag bearer of the NDC re-summoned the spirit of the National Sanitation Day, which was introduced by him, when he led his security detail to weed the midsection of the road leading to the military cemetery in Accra to improve visibility along the road."</p>
      <p>The NDC said it believes Mr Mahama's example must be replicated across the country in order to rid the country of the filth that has engulfed it "under the watch of Akufo-Addo and his failed Sanitation Minister."</p>
