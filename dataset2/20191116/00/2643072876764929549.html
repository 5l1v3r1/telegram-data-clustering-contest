      <h1>Why INEC May Cancel Kogi/Bayelsa Election Results – Okoye</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T00:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">George Ogbolu</a></address>
      <p>Festus Okoye, the <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/16/just-in-inec-cancels-election-in-ologi-bayelsa/"><u><b>Independent National Electoral</b></u></a> Commissioner in charge of Information and Voter Education, has said results from polling units that ballot boxes were snatched may be cancelled.</p>
      <p>The INEC Commissioner told The Nation that cancellation of results depends on reports from the presiding officer in such units.</p>
      <p>He also denied knowledge that Governor Yahaya Bello and the All Progressives Congress (APC) was forcing the Commission to sign prefilled results.</p>
      <p>Okoye said if there are areas where ballot box snatching was reported, the presiding officer is expected to write a report on such incident to the Electoral Officer stating the issues concern.</p>
      <p>He noted that such a report will help INEC to determine whether the results will be cancelled outrightly or not.</p>
      <p>The INEC Commissioner said further that until such reports are received from the officers on the field, the commission will not take a decision on it.</p>
      <p><i>“We have some Resident and National Commissioners and other senior staff of the commission on the field. They are doing their job in accordance with the law,”</i> he said.</p>
