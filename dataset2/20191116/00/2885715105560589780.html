      <h1>Gujarat government to hold placement drive this month, 1,900 students register</h1>
      <h2>Second chance for those left out of the mega job camp held earlier this year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T00:55:42+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 00:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/ritu-sharma/" target="_blank">RITU SHARMA</a></address>
      <p>The Gujarat Education Department will hold a two-day placement drive for the students who graduated in June this year but failed to land a job during the first placement camp organised earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Out of 56,000 students who did not turn up or were not placed during the state government’s first 15-day placement drive organised in January-February this year, nearly 1,900 have registered this time. The two-day drive is scheduled on November 25 and 28 at Knowledge Consortium of Gujarat (KCG) Ahmedabad and MSU Vadodara.</p>
      <p>For these 1,900 students from technical and non-technical colleges across the state, some 2,030 jobs from four companies representing banking and finance and information technology (IT) are to be offered. The companies are ICICI, IDBI First, Tech Mahindra and Ahmedabad-based ICT Infracon.</p>
      <p>“We decided to hold this drive to give the students, who could not get placed earlier this year, a second chance. We had sent them SMS in October urging them to register for the drive. Accordingly, 1,900 students have registered themselves,” said Anju Sharma, principal secretary of education.</p>
      <p>A dedicated portal for placements has been created and maintained by the education department.</p>
      <p>“There is an equal mix of graduates among these 1,900 students from 514 technical and non-technical colleges in Gujarat. They are graduates in BE, BTech and diploma engineering, BCom, BSc, BCA, BA.,” said D A Parikh, the placement co-ordinator.</p>
      <p>Talking about the job profile and location, Sharma said, “These are for BPO, sales and marketing and computer programming for locations in and around Ahmedabad and Vadodara, a reason for holding the camps at these two locations. Since many candidates do not prefer to leave their home town or move far away, these companies have been selected.”</p>
      <p>The results of the placement camp were not too encouraging as out of the 35,000 students who appeared in the mega placement drive hosted by the Gujarat government, only 15 per cent (nearly 5,100) from technical and non-technical colleges were selected by 1,290 companies. Altogether 74,000 students had registered for the drive earlier this year, but less than half actually turned up. Over 1.25 lakh students graduated from 514 government and grant-in-aid colleges during the academic year ending June 2019.</p>
