      <p>The UFC visits Brazil for the third and final time in 2019 on Saturday for the ESPN+ streaming UFC Fight Night 164 card. In the main event, Jan Blachowicz welcomes Ronaldo “Jacare” Souza to the light heavyweight division. Blachowicz, who is the No. 6 ranked fighter in the 205-pound division, is coming off a second-round knockout win over Luke Rockhold, while Souza heads into Saturday’s contest with a decision loss to Jack Hermansson in his most recent outing.</p>
      <p>In the co-main event, former UFC light heavyweight champion Mauricio Rua looks to continue his resurgent run against Paul Craig. Rua is 4-1 in his past five outings and coming off a third-round TKO win over Tyson Pedro in December 2018. Rua’s recent run is by far the best stretch of fights he has had under the UFC banner. In his first 14 fights with the promotion, Rua never put together two consecutive wins. Craig is 4-4 with the UFC. None of those fights have gone the distance. Craig has earned a post-fight bonus in each of his UFC victories.</p>
      <p>Also appearing on the main card is submission ace Charles Oliveira. Oliveira has won five straight fights by stoppage. Four of those victories came via submission. Oliveira faces Jared Gordon in a lightweight bout. Gordon is 3-1 in the UFC and coming off a decision win over Dan Moret. </p>
