      <p>GURGAON:Â The Asian Tour event in smog-hit northern India was shortened to 54 holes on Friday (Nov 15) amid the severe weather conditions, as Thailand's Itthipat Buranatanyarat took a two-shot lead after the delayed first round.</p>
      <p>Organisers of the four-day US$400,000 tournament delayed the start of the event on Thursday "due to poor visibility and weather conditions", with the first rounds played on Friday.</p>

      <p>Itthipat, wearing a face mask against the hazardous air pollution, fired an eight-under-par 64 on Thursday, with Indonesia's Danny Masrin just two shots adrift with a 66.</p>
      <p>Myanmar's Ye Htet Aung, with his career-best score, and Australia's Terry Pilkadaris joined Masrin on 66 after completing their rounds on Friday.</p>
      <p>Nine Indians were tied-fifth after recording 67s.</p>
      <p>"I kept all distractions out and was solely focused on making good shots today," Aung said.</p>
      <p>"I'm really happy as this is possibly my lowest round I had on Tour. I've been playing well."</p>
      <p>A four-tee start was scheduled for Saturday's second round with the third and final round to be played on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The first edition of the Panasonic Open was played in 2011, with Indian players winning seven of the previous eight tournaments.</p>
