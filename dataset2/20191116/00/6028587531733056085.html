      <h1>MVP Rankings: Harden, LeBron, Giannis ... And Doncic Looming</h1>

      <p>The best record in the NBA belongs to the Boston Celtics (10-1), but they do not really have a legit MVP candidate. They are getting a ton from Kemba Walker, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, but neither has distinguished himself yet as a Top 3 MVP candidate.Right behind them are the Los Angeles Lakers, who are showing what a dynamic duo (LeBron James and Anthony Davis) can do ... especially when there is so much depth at every position, which is needed now that D’Angelo Russell’s hand injury will keep him out at least two weeks.</p>
      <p>Third are the Houston Rockets (9-3), who are getting better and better as Russell Westbrook and James Harden learn how to play alongside one another.</p>

      <p>Harden is now averaging a league-best 38.7 points – 2.6 points above his league-leading average from a year ago.</p>
      <p>So who is the leading MVP candidate as we sit here roughly 1/8th of the way through the season?</p>
      <p>This writer says it is too close to call right now, with Harden and James in a virtual dead heat for first, with The Greek Freak and the reigning Rookie of the Year looming.</p>
      <p>Harden leads the league in 3-pointers made (3.6) and is sixth in assists, while James leads the NBA is assists at 11.1 per game but is 17th in scoring at 24.3 ... his lowest scoring average since he averaged 20.9 points per game as a rookie. Much of that can be attributed to the addition of Davis, who is scoring at a 25.2 ppg clip.</p>

      <p>And then we have Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks, who is averaging a career-high 30.5 ppg and shooting a career-best 58 percent from the field. At 8-3, the Bucks are tied with the Heat and Raptors for second place in the East.</p>
      <p>So that is the short list ... but it is early in the season.</p>
      <p>So let’s not forget to mention Luka Doncic of the Dallas Mavericks, who are 6-5 and were the darlings of the league earlier in the week before losing two games in a row.</p>
      <p>He has five triple-doubles to James’ four, while Westbrook has had only two. (It was just two seasons ago that Westbrook finished his third straight season averaging double figures in points, rebounds and assists. He and Oscar Robertson remain the only players in NBA history to average a T-D for an entire season.</p>

      <p>Doncic is at 28.7 ppg, 10.3 rebounds and 9.3 assists. And as he and Kristaps Porzingis get more and more familiar playing with each other, it is not out of the question that he joins Oscar and Russ.</p>
      <p>As for those two Celtics, we’ll have to take a wait and see approach.</p>
      <p>Boston has won 10 in a row, with four more games remaining on the Western Conference trip that they began last night with a victory in Golden State.</p>
      <p>With Tatum, Walker and Brown all averaging over 20 points per game, perhaps the postseason award they are lining themselves up for is Coach of the Year for Brad Stevens.</p>
