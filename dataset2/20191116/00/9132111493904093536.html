      <p>The mortal remains of a slave during the slave trade era is expected to be buried in Assin Manso, a town in the Central Region in Ghana.</p>
      <p>The remains of the unknown slave were brought into the country by a delegation from Barbados led by the Prime Minister, H.E. Mia Mottley.</p>
      <p>This will bring to three, the number of African ancestral remains buried at the Assin Manso slave river site.</p>
      <p>The delegation is in Ghana for a 3-day visit. The visit also forms part of the bilateral discussions started during the President's visit to Barbados.</p>
      <p>Her Excellency, Mia Mottley will also be in Assin Manso where a Durbar of Chiefs will be held in her honour at the forecourt of the Assin Manso Ancestral River Site.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Mottley will also visit the Kwame Nkrumah Mausoleum and participate in the Damba Festival in Yendi over the weekend.</p>
      <p>Her delegation includes Foreign Affairs, protocol, and business leaders. According to the Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture, Hon. Barbara Oteng Gyasi, Ghana's tourism sector seeks to deepen its interest in the Carribean with Barbados as a key gateway.</p>
      <p>The Coordinator of the Year of Return and CEO of the Ghana Tourism Authority, Akwasi Agyeman, says the visit highlights the importance of the Year of Return in the Global African discussions.</p>
