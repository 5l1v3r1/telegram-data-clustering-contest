      <p>A game-winning play from a big-game player saved Ulster as they left the Rec with a 17-16 victory over Bath.</p>
      <p>It was Jacob Stockdale who was Dan McFarland's star as the Ireland winger made an outstanding last-second intervention to stop a certain Bath try and ensure the one-point victory.</p>

      <p>With the clock in the red, Ulster led by a point and thought they had won the game only to be penalised for a crooked lineout. From the resulting scrum, Bath worked their way deep into their Ulster territory. Girvan Dempsey would have been delighted with the attacking play that finally seemed to click.</p>
      <p>However, Stockdale marshaled his defence up before working back to make a crucial read and intercept Zach Mercer's pass.</p>

      <p>"I think it shows the collective and how hard we work for each other to see Jacob get back and stop them in the corner," said John Cooney after the game. A superb start to their European campaign for Ulster.</p>
