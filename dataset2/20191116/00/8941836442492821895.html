      <p>SHAWNEE, Okla. (AP) - Prosecutors have rested in the murder trial a man charged in the fatal shooting of an Oklahoma police officer.</p>
      <p>The Oklahoman reports that prosecutors rested Friday in the first-degree murder trial of 38-year-old Byron James Shepard of Okemah for the March 2017 shooting death of 22-year-old Tecumseh officer Justin Terney.</p>
      <p>Defense attorneys say the shooting was unintentional. Prosecutors contend Shepard shot Terney in an effort to avoid going to jail.</p>
