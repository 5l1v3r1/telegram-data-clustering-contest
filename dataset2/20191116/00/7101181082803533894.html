      <h3>Mark Your Calendars </h3>
      <p>This year, Cyber Monday falls on Dec. 2, after the long Thanksgiving and Black Friday weekend. Check the dates closely as some brands and retailers launch the sale a day or two earlier. It can also continue through the next day for Giving Tuesday, for which some offer a charitable component to the sale. Additionally, lots of Black Friday sales extend to Cyber Monday. </p>
      <h3>So Many Brands, So Little Time </h3>
      <p>Based on last year, lots of fashion and beauty brands and retailers that have e-commerce websites will participate in Cyber Monday. This includes big department stores like Target, Macy's, Nordstrom, Bloomingdale's and more. Online-only retailers such as Shopbop, ASOS and Amazon are particularly expected to deliver big deals. Don't forget beauty! Ulta, Sephora, Glamglow, Becca Cosmetics, Bite Beauty and Dermstore all had Cyber Monday discounts in 2018. </p>
      <h3>Shopping Tips </h3>
      <p>Until the exact deals and discounts are announced, we suggest you browse ahead of time to bookmark or save in cart the products you're coveting. </p>
