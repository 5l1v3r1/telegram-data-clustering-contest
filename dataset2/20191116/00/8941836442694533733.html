      <p>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) - The Utah high school where the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/disney/">Disney</a> movie “High School Musical” was filmed over a decade ago has become a tourist destination, and the trend could grow with the premiere of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/disney/">Disney</a>’s new streaming service series based on the film.</p>
      <p>Much of the popular 2006 movie was filmed at <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/east-high-school-in-salt-lake-city/">East High School in Salt Lake City</a>. To draw in fans, the state office of tourism has compiled a four-day, four-night “High School Musical Itinerary” for visitors to follow, the Deseret News recently reported.</p>
      <p>The campus is open to visitors for a self-guided walking tour on weekdays from 2:30 until 7 p.m. Some tourists just want to take their pictures in front of the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/east-high-school-in-salt-lake-city/">school</a>’s now widely recognized façade.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/east-high-school-in-salt-lake-city/">school</a> again welcomed a <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/disney/">Disney</a> cast and crew in 2018 to film a series based on the movie. The filming that went from the end of the school year through the summer made the campus busy, but it wasn’t overwhelming, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/east-high-school-in-salt-lake-city/">East High School</a> assistant principal <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ken-devries/">Ken DeVries</a> said.</p>
      <p>“They’re very good to work with us. They’re doing everything they can to stay out of our way,” he said.</p>

      <p>Most visitors to the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/east-high-school-in-salt-lake-city/">school</a> are respectful, though they can sometimes get a little aggressive. And it’s challenging when tour buses stop, he said.</p>
      <p>“That’s when it gets a little obnoxious,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ken-devries/">DeVries</a> said.</p>
      <p>But overall, having a place in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/disney/">Disney</a> history and the hearts of fans who flock to campus has been positive, he said.</p>
