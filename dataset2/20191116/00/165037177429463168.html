        <b>Gareth Southgate is set to bring Raheem Sterling back from his brief England exile in Sunday's Euro 2020 qualifier against Kosovo as he seeks to end the controversy over the Manchester City star's row with Joe Gomez.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Sterling </b>was dropped for Thursday's 7-0 rout of <b>Montenegro</b> after clashing with England team-mate <b>Gomez </b>in the Three Lions' training base canteen.</p>
      <p>It is believed <b>Sterling </b>was unhappy with <b>Gomez </b>following an altercation with the <b>Liverpool </b>defender during City's Premier League defeat at <b>Anfield </b>last weekend.</p>
      <p>Although <b>Sterling </b>was left out of the <b>Montenegro </b>game as punishment for his attack on <b>Gomez</b>, <b>Southgate</b> has confirmed the winger will return for England's final <b>Group A</b> fixture.</p>
      <p><b>Sterling and Gomez</b>, left with a scratch under his eye after the incident, are said to have patched up their relationship, but the centre-back was jeered by <b>England </b>fans at <b>Wembley </b>when he came on as a substitute against <b>Montenegro</b>.</p>
      <p>Both <b>Southgate and Sterling</b> expressed their support for <b>Gomez </b>and criticised the booing supporters, with the <b>England </b>manager reportedly comforting the shocked 22-year-old and his family after the match.</p>
      <p>Now <b>Southgate</b> could include <b>Gomez </b>against <b>Kosovo </b>in a show of support for the <b>Liverpool </b>player.</p>
      <p>With <b>England </b>already guaranteed to qualify for <b>Euro 2020</b> in first place in their group, <b>Southgate</b> already planned to make changes, although he is keen to ensure <b>England </b>finish with a win as they eye a top-six seeding in next year's tournament.</p>
      <p>"We will make some changes, for sure, but the seeding in the group could be <b>critical </b>and we know it's a big night for the Kosovans," <b>Southgate</b> said.</p>
      <p>"It's a <b>shame </b>for them that they're now out of this part of the qualification, although they've still got the play-offs in which I think they'll be a huge threat in that format.</p>
      <p>"So, it will be a good test for us because it will still be a <b>lively environment</b>.</p>

      <p>"The <b>enthusiasm </b>for the game is high and we want to finish the group with as many points as we can."</p>
      <p>
        <b>- 'Got to be better' -</b>
      </p>
      <p>Liverpool captain <b>Jordan Henderson</b> could return following a one-match ban, while <b>Southgate </b>has to decide whether to keep faith with <b>Ben Chilwell</b> ahead of <b>Danny Rose</b> at left-back.</p>
      <p><b>Harry Kane</b> may have scored a hat-trick against <b>Montenegro</b> but it was Leicester's <b>Chilwell</b> who was named England's man of the match following a fine display in which he provided three assists in the opening 24 minutes.</p>
      <p>"Ben, I liked the hunger in his game, the enthusiasm to get forward," <b>Southgate </b>said.</p>
      <p>"The whole team pressed well but he also pressed well from that <b>full-back position</b>, got into overlaps, his quality of delivery was excellent."</p>
      <p>Although <b>England </b>have cruised through their qualifying group, <b>Southgate</b> believes the <b>2018 World Cup semi-finalists</b> still have room for improvement as they chase a first major title since 1966.</p>
      <p>"There were <b>a couple of chances</b> we conceded that just shouldn't happen, so that's still part of our game that we've got to improve upon," he said.</p>
      <p>"If we are to be a team that are going to <b>challenge </b>seriously, although we're young, we've got to manage games well.</p>
      <p>"We've got to make sure that, although we're such a <b>fantastic attacking threat</b>, the rest of the team is right as well. There are things we've got to be better at."</p>
