      <p>CLEVELAND (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/harrison-dillard/">Harrison Dillard</a>, the former Buffalo Soldier and only Olympic runner to win gold medals in both the sprints and high hurdles, has died. He was 96.</p>
      <p>Longtime friend Ted Theodore said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/harrison-dillard/">Dillard</a> died Friday at the Cleveland Clinic after a fight with stomach cancer. The 1955 Sullivan Award winner as the nation’s outstanding amateur athlete, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/harrison-dillard/">Dillard</a> was the oldest living U.S. Olympic champion.</p>
      <p>“It is a loss for humanity,’’ Theodore said Cleveland.com. “He was an example for all of us, how to live our lives, with never an unkind word for anyone. He was a champion, a true champion.’’</p>
