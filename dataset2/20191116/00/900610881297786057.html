      <h1>NATS visualisation gives behind-the-scenes look at air traffic control</h1>

      <p>NATS, the UK’s main air navigation service provider, has released an interactive visualisation showing how air traffic controllers get planes from A to B.</p>
      <p>It is part of a web series aiming to illustrate how 8,000 flights a day move through UK airspace.</p>
      <p>The latest post, called <a href="https://www.nats.aero/discover/plane-talking/">Plane Talking</a>, puts you in ATC at Heathrow at 0654 ready to send a British Airways A320 on its way to Manchester.</p>
      <p>“Delivery good morning, Shuttle 2 Lima, 320 on five-zero-one with PDC, new QNH one-zero-three-two is copied, fully ready,” the pilot tells you.</p>
      <p>You’ll then see how the crew will request to push back, be pushed onto the taxiway by a tug vehicle, taxi to various holding points, queue for the runway and be cleared for takeoff to the north of England.</p>
      <p>The visualisation then takes you on the 150-nautical-mile journey, and shows how factors like altitude and flight path are decided.</p>
      <p>By the time the flight lands at 0730, 73 messages have been exchanged between the aircraft and nine air traffic controllers.</p>

      <p>Over the summer, NATS <a href="https://www.businesstraveller.com/business-travel/2019/07/19/nats-warns-airspace-modernisation-needed-following-uks-busiest-ever-day-for-flights/">released a video</a> showing the paths of 8,863 flights in and out of the UK on July 5, the busiest-ever day for its airspace.</p>
      <p>In a year it will see around 2.6 million flights, which is predicted to rise to 3.25 million by 2030.</p>
