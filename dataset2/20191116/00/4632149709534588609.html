      <p><i>Department demands action plan before next syndicate meeting<br/></i><br/>After the recent incident of ragging of a 22-year-old BBA student in a private college affiliated to Bengaluru North University (BNU) came to light, the Ministry of Higher Education has decided to come down heavily on college managements of State universities and is considering stripping institutes of all UGC affiliations. <br/><br/>The department has also asked the State Universities to come up with an action plan to prevent the ragging in their next syndicate meetings. <br/><br/>A sources from the ministry said, “Despite a stringent action plan set by the University Grants Commission (UGC), reports of ragging are constantly reported. There are anti-ragging regulations in place to prevent such incidents and yet this is the case. Next time such an incident is reported, we have to have a stricter reaction and not squash student’s dreams.” <br/><br/>On November 4, the UGC issued yet another circular, reminding the Higher Education Institutions to take strict measures against ragging. The circular also mentioned a nationwide, toll free, anti-ragging helpline - 1800-180-5522 and said the issue was marked as ‘top’ priority.</p>

      <p>Rajnish Jain, secretary of UGC said, “In spite of all these measures, we are yet to completely eliminate the menace of ragging. This is adversely affecting the higher education system of the country. We request everyone to take strong measures to implement the Anti-Ragging Regulations in the respective states and take stringent action against those flouting the guidelines.” <br/><br/>The UGC had also demanded the State to be declared as “Ragging-Free State” at the earliest. However, within ten days of this circular from UGC, BM reported a story about a student being picked on by 15 others. A senior official from the department also said, “We have directed the Vice-Chancellors to take up this issue in their upcoming syndicate meetings and form an action plan in the university level. They have to ensure that they tick everything off the checklist and also take their own measures and report the same to the ministry within next one month.”</p>
