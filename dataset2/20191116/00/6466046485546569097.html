      <p>Genoa - A <b>merger between Saipem and Subsea 7</b> “would create a truly global oilfield service giant with over $12.4 billion in revenue,” said Audun Martinsen, head of oilfield service research at Rystad Energy.</p>
      <p>Commenting the unconfirmed reports that <b>the Italian and British-Luxembourgish oil and gas contractors may join forces</b>, the think tank’s expert notes that “The combined entity would have the world’s largest fleet of subsea installation vessels and be the largest provider of SURF services, with a market share of close to 40%. In addition, Saipem has a diverse portfolio including large-diameter pipeline installation vessels, offshore drilling rigs, one of the world’s biggest crane vessels and numerous offshore fabrication yards.”</p>
      <p>Such a merger would create the <b>fourth-largest oilfield service company</b>, after Schlumberger, Halliburton and Baker Hughes.</p>
      <p>Rystad Energy, independent energy research and consulting firm headquartered in Norway with offices across the globe, sees this move as <b>a direct response to recent developments on several fronts in the oilfield service industry</b>.</p>
      <p>By combining with Saipem, Subsea 7 would also get <b>exposure to onshore engineering </b>and construction, where Saipem has a solid track record in the petrochemical and liquefied natural gas industries, thus reducing dependence on upstream oil and gas activities.</p>
