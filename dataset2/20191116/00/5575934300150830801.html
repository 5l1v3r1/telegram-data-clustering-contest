      <p>LeBron James doesn’t plan on leaving the NBA any time soon.</p>
      <p>With Carmelo Anthony returning to the league at age 35 after signing with the Portland Trail Blazers, James was asked if he had made any plans regarding how he’d like to end his career.</p>
      <p>“Not really. Not the way I feel right now,” LeBron said, per ESPN’s Dave McMenamin. “Me and Tom Brady are one in the same. We’re going to play until we can’t walk no more.”</p>

      <p>It’s not the first time James has expressed a good amount of faith in his longevity. For years, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/lebron-james-son-bronny-nba-2018-11">James has insisted</a> that his ultimate goal is to play in the league with his son, Bronny James, who is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/lebron-james-bronny-lebron-james-jr-twitter-max-preps-2019-7">a high school freshman at Sierra Canyon</a>.</p>
      <p>Should Bronny turn into <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/lebron-james-warning-bronny-dunk-lebron-james-jr-poster-instagram-2019-7">the NBA prospect he’s expected to</a>, it would be at least four or five years until he can join the league, meaning that the elder James would be closing in of 40.</p>
      <p>Still, there’s little reason to doubt James can do it. In citing Brady, James reminds sports fans that things are a bit different now than they were a year ago, with players extending their careers longer and longer – last year, Dirk Nowitzki played his final NBA season at 40 years old.</p>
      <p>Further, with the way James is playing now – <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/video-lebron-james-no-look-pass-danny-green-lakers-2019-10">like an MVP candidate</a> as opposed to someone on the tail-end of their career – there’s little reason to even ask the question of his potential retirement.</p>
      <p>As things stand, it looks as though we’ll have LeBron and Brady playing at the highest level until they decide it’s time to hang it up. Chances are most sports fans don’t mind.</p>
