      <p><i>Techies want the Bangalore-Jolarpettai suburban train to halt at Hoodi, so travelling becomes easy</i> <br/><br/>Suburban rail passengers are demanding that more trains stop at Hoodi railway station as they need to alight at Whitefield or KR Puram and travel another 20 km to reach Hoodi. Techies say that if the Bangalore-Jolarpettai train halts for a minute in Hoodi during the peak hours, it will make life easier. However, the South-western Railway (SWR) said that it will not be feasible as many trains already stop at Hoodi. <br/><br/>Sanjeev Dyamannavar, transport expert, The Praja Raag Advocacy Group, explained how an additional train will help people travelling to and fro from the city. “This will make the trains more frequent on this suburban rail line. If it stops at Hoodi, it will benefit several IT professionals. The train need not stop after Whitefield. The Divisional Railway Manager (DRM) said that he’ll look into the matter and see if it can work out,” he says. <br/><br/>Ashok Kumar Varma, DRM, SWR said it could lead to some operational constraints as they need to look at the availability of the platforms as well. “A one-minute halt can take up about eight to ten minutes as the train will need to slow down, stop and then restart. Two such halts will delay the train by 16 to 20 minutes. It will also affect the schedule of other trains. Also, there are enough trains that halt at Hoodi during peak hours. We shall, however, see what can be done” he says.</p>
