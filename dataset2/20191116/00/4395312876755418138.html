      <p>It has been 5 years on the journey of being an entrepreneur. When I first started my company,<a href="https://iloveasiatour.com/"> i love asia tour</a> to empower women in tourism at the age of 21st, I never thought I would be who I am today . It has changed me so much especially my bravery &amp; positivity!</p>
      <p>I was someone who love the community &amp; like helping people. I always wanted to help many people I can. I thought creating a business which I can earn money to help people bcz I never like thinking about money.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How I have changed?</b>
      </p>
      <p>When my business was a small one which is based in <a href="https://iloveasiatour.com/visit-the-royal-palace-in-hue-vietnam/">Hue city , Vietnam </a>, it was a very happy business with <a href="https://iloveasiatour.com/hue-tours/">Hue Tours</a>. I remember I had a wonderful team in the beginning who are passionate about the mission for women &amp; community like I do. Never enough to say thank you to them to be with me in the beginning.</p>

      <p>I am always a passionate girl about the community &amp; women’s issues. I want to do more everyday. I used to do charity a lot when I just started the company . I felt my heart full of happiness when I can help people in need.</p>
      <p>Later, when the company grow &amp; I have so many employees around. The responsibility become heavier. I thought differently about business &amp; I had to think a way earn money for my employee’s life.</p>
      <p>5 years ago , I cried a lot when I met challenges! Oh god, I remember my PA – Kasia always say ” Please stop crying, it hurt me ” – Now, I don’t cry instead of being strong to look up solutions &amp; options quickly to move forward. I realize how strong I have became!</p>
      <p>Many more challenges will come more along the way. Sometimes, it has been a lot for a 26 years old girl. However, I believe in a mission empowering the success for women and community through tourism. I will keep doing my best! I am happy to look back for who I have became! <b>THANK YOU!</b></p>
      <blockquote>Business is business. Business has to earn money to take care employee’s life &amp; invest in other projects. Charity is a personal choice.</blockquote>
