      <p>No. 51 was once Jerod Mayo’s to wear. It’s another New England Patriots linebacker’s now.On the chest of Ja’Whaun Bentley.</p>
      <p>“Yeah, well, first of all, he wears 51,” Mayo told reporters on his <a href="https://www.patriots.com/audio/jerod-mayo-11-12-coach-is-the-same-person-day-in-and-day-out">conference call</a> earlier this week. “So naturally, I have an affinity to work with him.”</p>
      <p>Bentley arrived in New England 133 draft slots after Mayo. He arrived a decade after, and with a signing bonus not far north of $300,000. But the Purdue product brought both a physical and instinctive resemblance early on in 2018.</p>
      <p>A three-time captain for the Boilermakers, Bentley returned a fumble for a touchdown during his rookie preseason with the Patriots. He then <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliverthomas/2018/09/10/fifth-rounder-jawhaun-bentley-doesnt-look-out-of-place-in-patriots-defense/#56262f1a4451">started two games</a> in September while spending time with the green dot of defensive communication on the back of his helmet.</p>
      <p>Forward progress stopped as a torn bicep sent Bentley to injured reserve.</p>
      <p>This fall is a continuation of the one that began with 14 tackles and an interception. The one that began with Bentley, listed at 6-foot-2 and 255 pounds, showing signs of outdoing his “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliverthomas/2018/06/21/one-dimension-could-be-enough-for-patriots-rookie-thumper-jawhaun-bentley/#5dd7abb14309">thumper</a>” description. In a sense, the new No. 51 still is a rookie.</p>
      <p>And Mayo is his rookie inside linebackers coach.</p>

      <p>“Bentley’s one of those guys – very talented, and to your point, this is like a rookie year for him,” said Mayo. “At the same time, he’s been around the organization. He knows what to expect. He comes to work and brings his hard hat each and every day. And, going back to the room – you look at that room, it’s Jamie Collins, it’s Dont’a Hightower, Kyle Van Noy. He has a bunch of guys who are very helpful, smart guys, but also good football players and willing to work with him.”</p>
      <p>It's worked to the tune of 22 tackles this season for Bentley. He’s appeared in all nine games as a Patriots redshirt freshman on a four-year pact shy of $2.764 million. He’s graded out inside <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/jawhaun-bentley/50966">Pro Football Focus</a>’ top-20 qualifying linebackers in overall defense. And while starting just once on a depth chart featuring <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliverthomas/2019/09/22/linebacker-jamie-collins-making-a-second-wave-splash-with-patriots/#3bf5b25021cb">the aforementioned</a>, as well as first-year captain Elandon Roberts, there’s been an active place for the linebacker with a cap number in the ballpark of $645,000.</p>
      <p>Bentley has seen 33% of the snaps along the front and 29% of the snaps on special teams.</p>
      <p>In the fifth round an April ago, an adaptable role was found.</p>
      <p>“Oh, he’s a smart guy. He went to Purdue. He’s like an engineer,” the 33-year-old Mayo, a Tennessee Volunteer, said of the 23-year-old Bentley. “He’s a smart guy. You can throw a bunch of different things at him, and that’s what we pride ourselves on here as linebackers for the Patriots is just overall versatility. And with that, you have to be a smart guy to play different roles. He’s no different.”</p>
      <p>Mayo retired following the 2015 Patriots season. During his playing tenure, he was named AP Defensive Rookie of the Year, set the league lead in tackles, was once named a first-team All-Pro and twice named a Pro Bowler. Mayo served as a defensive captain from 2009 onward and earned a Super Bowl XLIX ring.</p>
      <p>It remains a lofty number to follow. With Bentley, it remains a starting point.</p>
      <p>“It’s definitely been a pleasure to help him in his development,” added Mayo. “We will see how it goes.”</p>
