      <h1>Dinos and Marauders ready to do battle</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T00:37:41+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 00:37</time> by <a rel="author">Rita Mingo, For the Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>This is one instance when maybe playing on the road is actually a good thing.</p>
      <p>“So happy,” grinned McMaster’s Jordan Lyons. “In Ontario, we had terrible weather, it was snowing insanely. So coming here, it’s better than it is at home so it’s a blessing just to be here.”</p>
      <p>The Ontario conference football champ Marauders flew into Calgary on Thursday night in anticipation of their Mitchell Bowl encounter with the hometown Dinos on Saturday afternoon (1 p.m. kick-off) at McMahon Stadium.</p>
      <p>The winner will advance to the Vanier Cup.</p>
      <p>The Marauders got to this point by defeating the top-ranked team in the country, the Western Mustangs, last weekend. One would assume there is no shortage of confidence in this group.</p>
      <p>“It tells us we can play with anyone in this league and understanding that we’re as good as any team in this league,” Lyons, a fifth-year running back, explained. “It was a really big win. It was kind of hard to really enjoy it because we have another game in another week. I haven’t taken it in fully yet but happy to be here and enjoying the process.”</p>
      <p>Marauders’ head coach Stefan Ptaszek had an eyeful of the Dinos last season when he was the offensive coordinator at UBC. So he has a pretty good notion of what to expect.</p>
      <p>“You spend your entire existence looking at Calgary’s defence,” he pointed out. “One of the most dynamic and aggressive in the conference, I think. They don’t let anyone dictate the game to them. They dictate the game to whoever is front of them. I think their man-to-man coverage skills are as good as anybody I’ve seen at this level. Well coached … rare to catch them out of position. It’ll be a great challenge.”</p>
      <p>The Marauders’ defensive strengths are also not lost on the Dinos.</p>
      <p>“We know that they’re a fast team,” noted Calgary running back Robinson Rodrigues, “they play physical, they blitz a lot but we’ve prepared this week a lot to deal with that. I’m familiar with their DC (Scott Brady), he was my head coach when I was at Mt. A (Mt. Allison) for a year, so I know he likes to do a lot of funky stuff on the front.”</p>
      <p>On offence, the Dinos will attempt to utilize a blend of run and pass, which has served them well the past couple of playoff weekends. A key contributor was the second-year Rodrigues, who finished with 92 yards rushing in the Hardy Cup.</p>
      <p>“It’s been great being a factor these last few games,” he admitted. “I think our run game has been coming together, everyone is buying in, and I think it’s making our offence more balanced. I think our offence in general is starting to click.”</p>
      <p>“That’s what we’ve done effectively this year, having a balanced attack,” echoed Dinos’ head coach Wayne Harris Jr. “Being able to control the ball. It took some time to develop and it seems to be going well right now. We’re going to have to continue that against a very good defence.”</p>
      <p>Harris added that Calgary quarterback Adam Sinagra, who was dinged in last weekend’s Hardy Cup, is a go for Saturday.</p>
      <p>“He’s good,” said Harris. “He threw the ball well last night, lots of zip on the ball. No problem getting the ball down the field so no major concerns.”</p>
      <p>Until they actually get on the field, neither side really has a tangible feel for the other team. From a player’s perspective, that’s a big black hole where the familiarity should be.</p>
      <p>“It is a challenge, but if we play our game, we’ll be successful,” said Rodrigues. “I’m sure they’re thinking the same thing. They play a different type of football in the OUA, but I’m sure if we come out and do our thing, we’ll be fine.”</p>
      <p>“That’s definitely a unique challenge,” Lyons agreed. “You can try and judge a guy’s speed or a guy’s strength on film, but it’s really hard to understand how good the player is until you get that face-to-face. I think the first quarter is going to be really big, getting familiar with what they like to do.”</p>
      <p>The last time these schools met in a playoff game was in 2012, McMaster winning in Hamilton 45-6. Coming out west hasn’t been kind of Ontario teams, however, as Canada West is 13-1 at home since 1968.</p>
      <p>“Our athletic department have worked their butt off to make sure that travel, food, all the little things are seamless so our coaches can coach and our players can get ready to play a football game,” said Ptaszek. “I have to tip my hat to the entire McMaster football department. We’ve had a huge day of travel, but our process and how we get ready for a football game has not frayed.”</p>
