      <h1>How to be a chick: The Ballad of the Besieged Mumbaikar</h1>

      <p>Given the tattered state of a headless Mumbai, it would be fair to compare us to that squawking chicken running around helplessly, after being decapitated by a butcher. Not sure if the current governor of Maharashtra would get the simile… and no, Bhagat Singh Koshyari definitely does not resemble the neighbourhood butcher, but hey – the haalat of the average Mumbaikar/Maharashtrian is pretty precarious at the moment. Even a headless chicken is better off – it knows the end is near. But, us? At the time of writing, several theories were floating around. The Empire of Evil Conspiracies is upon us, and analysts insist that the political developments in Maharashtra are following a well thought through script. And the author of the script is none other than Amit Shah. This is the way he planned the coup, say those who claim to be in the know. I find this most amusing, since nobody but nobody can fathom the Great Shah’s mind – not even NaMo. According to smart guessers, it was Sonia Gandhi’s ‘pettiness’, combined with Shah’s machinations, that led to this crazy situation. Was Sonia being petty when she refused to play ball with Sharad Pawar earlier this week? Will the lady relent? She is as ruthless and tough as the Maratha strongman. Maybe the sums just didn’t add up. There are those who say Sonia has basically lost interest and wants to focus on ‘other things’ after a life in politics. Perhaps she has also lost interest in pushing her son Rahul into running the Congress show. And getting Priyanka involved any more than she already is was never an option. Had Sonia played hard and not soft ball with Pawar, the fate of Maharashtra would have been different today. <br/><br/><br/>Discussing the breaking story with a group of informed, intelligent 40-somethings the other day, what emerged was a brutally honest perspective, not just on Maharashtra, but India. As one young man struggled to decode the implications of President’s Rule to a young woman (whose eyes glazed over rapidly), it was obvious from the comments flying around that a deep disillusionment has set in. A disillusionment so strong, so entrenched, it may lead to a flight of intellectual and real capital in the months ahead. “What’s happening in Maharashtra is sending out the worst signals to the business community here and abroad. We ourselves are wondering about our long-term engagement here, given that we came back from overseas 15 years ago, to participate in the India story.” This much is true. Here was a bright and highly motivated generation of young entrepreneurs who had kissed job opportunities in other countries goodbye, to come back and set up a new life in their home cities. They had prospered, married, produced kids, bought their first home, added a second holiday home, acquired three cars as the family grew… In other words, put down roots they hoped would be permanent. Today, they are looking to leave. I asked why, even though I had guessed the answer. I also asked where? “Florida!” answered an avid golfer, adding, “I want my kids to grow up in a cleaner, less polluted environment… just look at the quality of life in Mumbai. Look at our pathetic state. The city is collapsing. Check out the pot-holed roads, the filth and garbage, the price of living. It’s insane. We are doling out so much money, and what do we get in return?” <br/><br/>This is one question politicians never answer. They don’t need to. The quality of their life is intact. Each new generation only doubles the bank balance and adds wealth. None of this is legit money. It is stolen money – our money. We watch helplessly from the sidelines as the political jostling continues. The maneuvering for power is so blatant, it ought to shock – but doesn’t. Citizens expect to be manipulated and exploited since corruption has been institutionalised. Now we are told Pawar and the NCP will come up with a master plan. (The deal? Supriya Pawar as Union minister.) A master plan for what? Not for us! But for themselves! As for the Shiv Sena – let’s wait and see how that cookie crumbles. No matter which way the argument goes, what Maharashtra definitely cannot afford is another election. The state is reeling from spiraling prices and the absurdity of paying Rs 100 per kilo for onions. <br/><br/>Unseasonal rains have played havoc with our crops and now the uncertainty of what lies ahead politically is making citizens jittery. If Shah wants to remote control Maharashtra, be our guest. But do it efficiently. We need infrastructure and investments, health care packages and rural education. Devendra Fadnavis tried and failed – the election results proved it. The Sena-Congress-NCP combo sounds worse than a vada pav stuffed with pasta and served swimming in a spicy ‘amti’. Getting back to basics may not be possible – the days of jhunka-bhakri are over. Hybrid fast food is here to stay. To make it edible, palatable and affordable, Shah will have to do much more than add dhokla to the menu. Till we in Maharashtra know which way the wind is blowing, it’s wise to voluntarily shut up and put up. Till the gag order becomes official.</p>
