      <h1>President Buhari Breaks Silence On The Sack Of Osinbajo’s Aides (Video)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T00:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Oladipo Abiola</a></address>
      <p>President of Nigeria, <b>Muhammadu Buhari</b> has denied sacking <b><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/07/see-the-names-and-positions-of-35-osinbajos-aides-recently-sacked-by-buhari-full-list/"><u>thirty-five (35) aides</u></a></b> working in the office of the Vice President, <b>Yemi Osinbajo</b>.</p>
      <p>The President, however, explained that what happened was a redeployment of the affected persons to a new ministry.</p>
      <p>President Buhari spoke on the controversial issue on Friday <b><a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/15/just-in-buhari-returns-to-nigeria-after-private-visit-to-uk/"><u>upon his return from a private visit</u></a></b> to the United Kingdom.</p>
      <p>While fielding questions from NTA State House Correspondent at the Presidential Wing of the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja, Buhari said it is unfortunate that some people have decided to read political meanings into the development.</p>
      <p>Buhari said what simply happened was a re-organisation and not a sacking, as widely reported.</p>
      <p>He also identified the new ministry as the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development.</p>
      <p><i>“They said 35 people were sacked in the Vice President’s office but we just created a ministry and we reorganized but people are giving it an ethnic and political dimension. It is unfortunate,”</i> the President said.</p>
