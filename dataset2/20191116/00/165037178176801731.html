        <b>Brazil must start getting results again after suffering a loss to Argentina, coach Tite said.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Tite </b>accepted <b>Brazil </b>were under pressure after their winless run continued with a 1-0 loss to rivals <b>Argentina </b>in a friendly on Friday.</p>
      <p><b>Lionel Messi</b> scored the game's only goal on his return to the <b>Argentina</b> team in Riyadh, converting a rebound after <b>Alisson </b>saved his penalty in the 13th minute.</p>
      <p><b>Gabriel Jesus</b> had earlier put a penalty wide for <b>Brazil</b>, who are winless in five games since lifting the <b>Copa America</b> in July.</p>
      <p><b>Tite </b>said there was pressure on <b>Brazil </b>– who face <b>South Korea</b> in another friendly on Tuesday – amid their poor run of results.</p>

      <p>"<b>There is a need for the result</b>, yes. There are moments of pressure and this is one," <b>Tite </b>told a news conference.</p>
      <p>"The way we are going to look is carefully<b>, </b>but the need for the result occurs, even at a time of preparation."</p>
      <p><b>Brazil </b>were without the injured <b>Neymar</b>, and they are feeling the absence of the <b>Paris Saint-Germain star</b>.</p>
      <p>Tite's side have scored just four goals in their past five games and the coach <b>lamented Brazil's inability to take their chances</b>.</p>
      <p>"Translating opportunities into goals <b>is key</b>, and I also speak of the penalty," he said.</p>
