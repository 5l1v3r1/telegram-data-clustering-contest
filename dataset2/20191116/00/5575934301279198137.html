      <p>President Donald Trump on Friday evening absolved three US service members who were either convicted or were still facing trial of war crimes.</p>
      <p>“The President, as Commander-in-Chief, is ultimately responsible for ensuring that the law is enforced and when appropriate, that mercy is granted,” the White House said in a statement on Friday evening. “For more than two hundred years, presidents have used their authority to offer second chances to deserving individuals, including those in uniform who have served our country.”</p>
      <p>“These actions are in keeping with this long history,” the White House added. “As the President has stated, ‘when our soldiers have to fight for our country, I want to give them the confidence to fight.'”</p>
      <p>Trump signed an executive order to grant clemency to US Army 1st Lt. Clint Lorance, who was convicted of ordering soldiers to engage three unarmed Afghan men on a motorcycle, killing two of them in July 2012. Lorance served six years of his 19-year sentence.</p>
      <p>Trump also signed an executive order to grant clemency to US Army Maj. Mathew Golsteyn, whose trial has yet to begin. Golsteyn stands accused of killing an unarmed Afghan man in 2010, and later disposing the body in a trash pit.</p>
      <p>US Navy Special Warfare Operator 1st Class Edward Gallagher, a Navy SEAL who was demoted after a military trial found him guilty of posing in a picture with the corpse of an Islamic State militant, had his rank reinstated to Chief Petty Officer. Gallagher was accused of pre-mediated and attempted murder in the stabbing of an ISIS fighter and an alleged shooting of two people in Iraq in 2017. Gallagher was acquitted on both counts.</p>
      <p>The Army and Navy issued separate statements acknowledging Trump’s executive order and said they were in the process of implementing them.</p>
      <p>Trump and the White House have been mulling over the decision for months, according to multiple news reports. On Thursday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/us/politics/trump-military.html">The New York Times</a> reported that Defence Secretary Mark Esper and Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy had advised the commander-in-chief not to interfere in the high profile cases. Military officials have been reportedly worried that a sweeping pardon could negatively affect discipline within the ranks.</p>
      <p>“I do have full confidence in the military justice system,” Esper, a former US Army officer, previously said.</p>
      <p>As the commander-in-chief, Trump has the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/trump-pardon-service-member-legal-questions-eddie-gallagher-2019-5">authority</a> to issue pardons, even before the completion of a trial, according to Eugene Fidell, a military justice lecturer at Yale Law School and a former US Coast Guard judge advocate.</p>
      <p>“A president can grant a pardon or other form of clemency before a conviction, sentencing, trial, and indictment – but not before the offence itself,” Fidell said to Business Insider.</p>
      <p>“The president is a convening authority by Act of Congress,” Fidell added. “The rules provide that a superior convening authority can take the case away from a subordinate convening authority and decide what to do with it.”</p>
