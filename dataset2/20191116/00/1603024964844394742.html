      <p>"We have decided to hold a massive culminating rally against the anti-people policies of the central government on November 30 in Delhi's Ramlila Maidan. The meeting has decided to name it as 'Bharat Bachao Rally' because people are suffering very much," he said.</p>
      <p>The Congress held a meeting of its general secretaries, chiefs of its frontal organisations', department heads, state unit chiefs and Congress Legislative Party (CLP) leaders on November 16.</p>
      <p>"The meeting was called to discuss the agitation programme... against the central government's anti-people policies, especially economic slowdown, farmers distress, huge unemployment and other issues," Venugopal said.</p>
      <p>The PCC Presidents and CLP leaders said that majority of the places - more than 60 percent of the country â€“ had successfully held the agitations at district-level and state-level, he added.</p>
      <p>"Due to the circumstances, you know, after the Ayodhya verdict, Section 144 was imposed in some districts and there were some issues, therefore, we told them to hold back for some days. Rest of the districts and the states will complete the agitation before 25th November," Venugopal explained.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
