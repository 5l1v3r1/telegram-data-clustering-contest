      <p>A picturesque port city in Western Australia, Fremantle may not be at the top of most travelers’ Aussie itineraries—but it should be. Charming, dynamic, creative and with a wealth of fascinating history, it’s one of those under-the-radar gems that intrepid travelers love to discover. Only a 30-minute drive from Perth (another Aussie city that deserves more attention), the town of less than 10,000 is an unconventional, can’t-quite-put-you-finger-on-it mix of captivating people and sites that you can’t help but find yourself falling in love with. Here are just some of the attractions that will have you enchanted with this quirky corner of Australia.</p>

      <p>Ok, Ok. Ranking a prison as a city’s main attraction may not exactly seem in line with Fremantle’s image of a friendly, welcoming spot. But that’s all the more reason to come visit and see for yourself how this town of many personalities never fails to charm. Fremantle Prison is a UNESCO World Heritage Site (the only building with such a designation in Western Australia). Built by prisoners in the 1850s the foreboding setting was notorious for its cruel treatment of its unfortunate inhabitants. Sadly, it’s also where more than 40 inmates met their maker in the prison’s gallows. Tours are available, with the “Torchlight” night tour sure to give you nightmares thanks to its reputation for ghost sightings. Better yet, check out the jail and the town as well with Michael Deller of <a href="http://fremantletours.com.au/">Fremantle Tours</a>. Deller’s love for his hometown is infectious and his knowledge is unparalleled.</p>

      <p>Dating back to the late 1800’s, this historic Fremantle site has a much more welcoming reputation than the nearby prison. Inside you’ll be greeted by the boisterous cries of over 150 merchants selling an eye-catching spectrum of food, fashion, art, jewellery and more. The market is a Fremantle institution and is as much about visiting with friends and neighbors over a slice of honey cake as it is about shopping. Visitors to the city will find the market an ideal place to tap into Fremantle’s vibe and get great tips from locals about where to eat and stay.</p>

      <p>Cappuccino Strip</p>
      <p>Named for the street’s incredible number of Italian restaurants (Fremantle has a strong history of Italian immigration), this lively, pretty promenade is one of the city’s main arteries. Lined with restaurants, locally-owned brew pubs, bookstores (that offer enticing “blind dates”) and bars, a walk along this main drag is a must-do when in Fremantle. Many of Fremantle’s true gems, however, are found by wandering down the many side streets that span outward from the strip. Let your curiosity lead the way and you’ll soon be stumbling upon lovely Aboriginal and local art galleries, clothing stores, coffee shops, boutique hotels and more. There are lots of wonderful eateries off the main street as well; try Kuld Creamery,  Bread In Common, Cos Baby and Strange Company, just to name a few.</p>

        <b>The Art</b>
      </p>
      <p>Arguably, there is nothing that quite captures the mysterious magic, the <i>je-ne-sais-quoi </i>of Fremantle and its citizens as the incredibly dazzling kaleidoscope of street art that seems to await you around every corner. From an homage to an endangered species, to an intricate microcosm of community, to portraits of beauty that are meant to startle and provoke, there seems to be an engaging form of artwork in nearly every nook and cranny of the city, each one more stunning, intriguing and thought-provoking than the last.</p>

        <b>Bathers Beach</b>
      </p>
      <p>Even if you don’t consider yourself an art aficionado, you’re sure to agree that Fremantle’s Bathers Beach is a work of art. With its gorgeous white sands and gentle undulating waves, it’s a perfect (if small) spot for the whole family to enjoy some sun and surf. Head to nearby <a href="http://www.bathersbeachhouse.com.au/">Bathers Beach House</a> restaurant to dine on delicious fresh food just steps from the beach as you toast the sunset with some tasty Australian sparkling.</p>
