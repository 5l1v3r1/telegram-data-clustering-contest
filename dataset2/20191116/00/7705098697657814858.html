      <p><a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/loki"><b>Loki</b></a> hates sharing the spotlight, but his upcoming Disney+ series has finally begun to assemble its supporting cast. <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/loki-sophia-di-martino-tom-hiddleston-marvel-1203406777/">Variety</a> is reporting that British actress Sophia Di Martino will star on the show opposite Tom Hiddleston’s titular God of Mischief. Surprising no one, the nature of her role remains unknown at this time.</p>
      <p>Di Martino was recently seen in Danny Boyle’s Beatles homage, <b>Yesterday</b>. She was also part of the main cast of the British series <b>Flowers</b>, which aired on Channel 4 in the U.K. and on Seeso in the U.S. Some of Di Martino’s other screen credits include two episodes of AMC’s <b>Into the Badlands</b> as well as recurring appearances on the Sky series <b>Mount Pleasant</b> and BBC One’s <b>Casualty</b>.</p>

      <p><a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/rick-and-morty"><b>Rick and Morty</b></a> veteran Michael Waldron is writing <b>Loki</b>, which also recently recruited Kate Herron as a director. Hiddleston has previously teased that fans will see his character use the Tesseract to cause more trouble. According to rumors, viewers will follow Loki as he travels through time and leaves his mark on various historical events. Plus, the series will reportedly have wide-ranging effects on the larger MCU. Kevin Feige confirmed earlier this month that it will also tie into <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/doctor-strange-in-the-multiverse-of-madness"><b>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</b></a>. Production is expected to begin in early 2020.</p>
      <p><b>Loki</b> will premiere on Disney+ in spring 2021.</p>
