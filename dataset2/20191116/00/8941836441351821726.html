      <p>SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) - Chase Claypool caught four touchdown passes to match a school record and No. 16 Notre Dame shut down Navy’s triple-option in a 52-20 rout on the 21st-ranked Midshipmen on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The 17th straight home victory for Brian Kelly’s Fighting Irish did not sell out <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/notre-dame-stadium/">Notre Dame Stadium</a>. It was the first time since 1973 Thanksgiving Day against Air Force, a string of 273 sold-out games. A crowd of 74,080, 3,542 below capacity, saw <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/notre-dame-stadium/">Notre Dame</a> win for the 79th time in the 93-game series that has been played continuously since 1927.</p>
      <p>Ian Book completed 14 of 20 passes for 284 yards and five touchdowns before exiting midway through the third quarter and the Irish (8-2, No. 16 CFP) up 45-3.</p>

      <p>Claypool caught seven passes for 117 yards with scoring receptions of 7, 47 and 3 yards from Book to give the Irish a 21-0 lead early in the second quarter. Book threw a 70-yard touchdown pass to sophomore Braden Lenzy later in the quarter as <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/notre-dame-stadium/">Notre Dame</a> took a 38-3 halftime lead and then hit Claypool with a 20-yard scoring pass on their final play of the game together. Claypool’s TD matched Maurice Stovall, who caught four TD passes against BYU in 2005.</p>
      <p>The loss ended a five-game winning streak for the Midshipmen (7-2, No. 23 CFP), who entered leading the nation in rushing with 357.9 yards per game. But the Irish defense forced three first-half fumbles by Navy’s shifty quarterback Malcolm Perry, who rushed 25 times for 117 yards before behind replaced in the third quarter by freshman Perry Olsen, who had a 43-yard TD pass to Mychal Cooper and a 2-yard TD run.</p>

      <p>Irish defensive end Khalid Kareem forced two fumbles and linebacker Drew White had 10 tackles. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/notre-dame-stadium/">Notre Dame</a> turned four fumble recoveries into 24 points.</p>
      <p>THE TAKEAWAY</p>
      <p>Navy: Perry was averaging 130.2 rushing yards entering the game. He managed a 46-yard run late in the first half that set up a Bijan Nichols’ 27-yard field goal, but for the most part was contained. Meanwhile, the Midshipmen’s defense, allowing just 310.6 yards a game, allowed 300 at halftime by the Irish and 415 for the game.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/notre-dame-stadium/">Notre Dame</a>: After throwing incomplete on his second attempt, Book completed 10 passes in a row. He also added 31 yards on five carries.</p>
