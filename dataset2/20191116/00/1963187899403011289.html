      <p>CAIRO – 16 November 2019: South Africa secured a goalless draw against the defending champions, Nigeria, to qualify to the semi-finals as group runner-up. <br/><br/>The Bafana Bafana will challenge the host nation, Egypt, for a spot at the final and a direct ticket to the Olympic Games in Tokyo. <br/><br/>The Egyptian team aims to avoid the agony of the first team who suffered early elimination from 2019 AFCON after losing to South Africa 1-0 at Cairo International Stadium. <br/><br/>Egypt defeated Cameroon 2-1 on Thursday night thanks to two goals from the tournament’s goal scorer Mostafa Mohamed to finish the group stage with 9 points from three straight wins to secure the top of the group. <br/><br/>Egyptian fans are expected to pack the stands of Cairo Stadium to support their players who produced strong performances at the group stage. <br/><br/>On the other hand, Ivory Coast defeated Zambia 1-0 to finish group B on top after gaining six points and they will face Ghana at the semis.</p>
