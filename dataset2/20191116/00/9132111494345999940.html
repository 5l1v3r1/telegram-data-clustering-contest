      <p>Former President John Mahama has called on government to urgently work to remove all hindrances that will hamper the smooth running of the December 17 referendum.</p>
      <p>Speaking to journalists in Wa, Mr Mahama stated that it would not be useful to go for a yes vote if certain amendments are not made to the existing constitution.</p>
      <p>“We have to repeal the part that says the President can appoint members of the District Assemblies,” he said.</p>
      <p>“People have created the impression that we are are going to vote for DCEs to be elected. What we are being asked at the referendum is: do we want political parties to participate in the local government process?” he clarified.</p>
      <p>The referendum has become necessary because Article 55 is an entrenched provision of the Constitution and, therefore, can only be amended after a majority yes vote.</p>
      <p>Government wants Ghanaians to back the proposed amendment through a vote but opposition National Democratic Congress, National House of Chiefs and the Chamber for Local Governance have kicked against the move.</p>
      <p>Speaking after a tour of some National Identification Authority’s (NIA) registration centres, he indicated that some residents complained about the slow registration pace of the Ghana Card.</p>

      <p>The former President called on the management of the NIA to speed up the process to prevent the inconveniences faced by prospective registrants.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, he urged Ghanaians to take the exercise seriously since the card helps identify Ghanaians in the disbursement of social benefits.</p>
