      <p>I had rather low expectations for <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/starwars/jedi-fallen-order"><i>Jedi: Fallen Order</i></a> a while back, given EA’s track record with Star Wars this generation and the fact that the footage being shown didn’t look like anything all that special. I then had medium expectations once I heard buzz that those who had played it really quite liked it, so I began to get my hopes up. And now that I have about ten hours into it? I…really, really like it, like most everyone seems to. Respawn has done an excellent job here salvaging EA’s <i>Star Wars</i> license with a powerful new entry in the <i>Star Wars</i> game canon, the likes of which we haven’t seen in many, many years.When I first heard the game being compared to <i>Dark Souls</i> in terms of how it handled the complexity of combat, I was a bit concerned, considering that series is not really my thing. I’ve dabbled in it, but the only game of that style I’ve seen to completion is <i>Bloodborne</i>, which was a trip, but far from my usual fare.</p>
      <p>Now that the game has arrived, I can see that <i>Fallen Order</i> is not just using <i>Dark Souls</i> inspiration in its combat, it’s using <i>Dark Souls</i> as a roadmap for pretty much the entire game, with a pinch of <i>God of War</i> thrown in for good measure.</p>

      <p>The level design and save points are what I’m mainly referring to here. While yes, you need to parry and dodge in combat, meaning you can’t just hack and slash, the <i>Dark Souls</i> style of going through a level, unlocking shortcuts, and risking lost XP on death you have to re-collect is something I was not expecting to see here.</p>
      <p>Of course, the main difference here is that <i>Jedi: Fallen Order</i> is generally far less punishing <i>than Dark Souls</i> games in many ways. It does feel like “Baby’s first <i>Dark Souls</i>” in terms of all the concessions it makes, and yet I would argue that’s not a bad thing. Instead, it’s a look at what a series like <i>Dark Souls</i> might look like if it <i>did</i> have difficulty options and the end result is a game for…all kinds of players.</p>
      <p>I’m currently playing on Normal, as I play most games on Normal my first time through, but there is also Story difficulty, which make combat cake, or ultra-hard Jedi Master difficulties that really start to emulate that <i>Dark Souls/Bloodborne/Nioh</i> type experience of brutal, punishing difficulty with little room for error.</p>
      <p>At least on Normal, some of the concessions made are things like the game will not count it as a “true” death if you fall off a ledge to your death, which is a frequent occurrence both here and in <i>Dark Souls</i>. But here while you just lose a bit of health and have to start over, in <i>Dark Souls</i> it sends you <i>all the way back</i> just like any other death would.</p>
      <p>To me, <i>Jedi: Fallen Order</i> strikes a balance between what people like about <i>Dark Souls</i> games where both combat and level design are decently complex, and what people like about more accessible AAA titles in that you don’t have to beat your head against a wall to get past most segments. I have only been outright frustrated with the “lost XP” thing a handful of times, like when I had 90% of a bar filled, and then accidentally stumbled into a hidden sub-boss arena I was not leveled for and got stomped. It was an arena you can’t escape from, so hitting him to get my XP back meant nothing on return visits, as I literally had to kill him to keep my lost XP. Between the ten minute walk from my last save point to even reach him, and the fact that I was painfully underskilled for him, I left that XP there and moved on. I still think about it.</p>

      <p>But generally? All this added “risk” of lost XP does is make you think more tactically about your approach to the level and its encounters. I recently had an epic chase where a Purge Trooper tracked me around half the map when I had 1 HP and no stims when I realized a single hit would kill me, as I sprinted to a save point to restart the encounter to have a better shot without losing XP in the process (and I made it!).</p>
      <p>All the <i>Dark Souls</i> stuff works here, and it’s the main reason why <i>Jedi: Fallen Order</i> is so interesting. Don’t get me wrong, I also liked <i>The Force Unleashed</i> where you’re just tearing through linear worlds as an OP Jedi, and yet there’s something that ultimate feels better about the more crafted care of combat and level-building here in <i>Fallen Order</i> that makes for an overall better experience.</p>
      <p>It’s nice to see someone learn lessons from Dark Souls design without necessarily making brutal, punishing difficulty part of the equation too, merely leaving it as an option for players. This is not an argument for <i>Dark Souls</i> easy mode, but rather just an explanation of what I’m liking about <i>Fallen Order</i> so far.</p>
