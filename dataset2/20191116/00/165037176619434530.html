      <p>According to 'AS', Fede Valverde could have been elsewhere. In summer 2014,<b> Arsenal's Wenger made an offer for him</b> and he asked him to come to Arsenal for a week. </p>
      <p>Everything was more or less sealed until Rodolfo Catino came along from Penarol. <b>They asked more money for him than </b>Arsenal and so Fede Valverde's move was halted. </p>
      <p>Just six months later,<b> the midfielder signed for </b>Real Madrid and he has not looked back. </p>
