      <p>Thus far in 2019/2020, FC Barcelona have conceded 15 goals in 12 domestic games and it is only due to the amount they have scored that they currently top La Liga with a superior +2 advantage over bitter rivals Real Madrid. With club legend Gerard Pique getting on in years and Samuel Umtiti unable to play more than two consecutive matches without getting injured, these factors and other developments in the transfer market have forced the Blaugrana to seek reinforcements in the upcoming January window.</p>
      <p>Other options already at their disposal include an in-form Clement Lenglet, who yet any suspensions or knocks obtained by either he or Pique will have Ernesto Valverde looking to young stars yo-yoing between the senior and B teams at the Catalan giants’ disposal.</p>
      <p>One of them is a compatriot of Lenglet and Umtiti’s in Jean-Clair Todibo and while the Frenchman was recently handed his debut in the 4-0 demolition of Sevilla last month, it has been reported by Le10Sport in their homeland that Bayer Leverkusen are keen to procure his services. Well aware of how a permanent sale would deplete their defensive line further,  Barça would only allow a temporary loan at best.</p>
      <p>On the same evening, Valverde tested the waters with another hotly-tipped centre back, Ronald Araujo, and though the Uruguayan was unfairly red-carded for bringing down Chicarito as the last man, he was impressive in Wednesday’s 2-0 friendly over FC Cartagena.</p>
      <p>The display prompted respected pundits such as Mundo Deportivo’s Xavier Bosch to demand that the club secure’s the 20-year-old’s future post haste. In the summer of 2018, as Bosch pointed out, Barça paid $1.65mn when tying him a five year contract - with a release clause of $110mn that automatically rises to $220mn once he becomes an established first team regular - but a pay rise is in order to keep him sweet.</p>
      <p>Both Todibo and Araujo works-in-progress, the quest to sign more established defensive figures is apparently already underway according to MARCA.</p>
      <p>A finding on director of football Eric Abidal and right-hand man Ramon Planes’ scouting mission in Brazil, Flamengo’s Rodrigo Caio has already been earmarked as one possible purchase.</p>
      <p>Aged 26 and on the verge of winning the Libertadores and Brasileirao Serie A titles, he has made four appearances for the senior national team whilst also sealing a premier Olympic gold in 2016 while donning yellow and green.</p>
      <p>Preparing for life after Luis Suarez, who like Pique turns 33 in early 2020, a long-term successor to El Pistolero is also deemed a top priority.</p>
      <p>Starring alongside Lionel Messi in yesterday’s 0-1 defeat of Brazil in the Saudi Arabia-hosted Superclasico yesterday, Inter Milan’s Lautaro Martinez has been on Barça’s radar long before putting the Italians a goal up at the Camp Nou in the Champions League a few weeks ago.</p>
      <p>Sticking with South America, 17-year-old wonderkid Reinier from Caio’s high-flying Rio giants is also top of their shopping list. That impressed by the multitalented midfielder and attacker, Flamengo have apparently been told to name their price.</p>
