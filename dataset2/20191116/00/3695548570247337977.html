        <b>Mercedes driver Raffaele Marciello held off Earl Bamber's Porsche to win the qualification race for the 2019 FIA GT World Cup in Macau.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 12-lap race got off to a wild start with Dries Vanthoor firing his Audi into the wall at Mandarin as he tried to get a run on the polesitting Mercedes.</p>
      <p>The Audi driver's race was effectively done on the spot, and Maro Engel was lucky to avoid a similar fate as he brushed the same wall while squabbling over fourth with Edoardo Mortara.</p>

      <p>With Vanthoor out of the picture, Marciello spent the first lap with the two Rowe Porsches, Bamber leading Laurens Vanthoor, breathing down his neck.</p>
      <p>But a reprieve quickly arrived, when the safety car was called to clear the stricken Audi from Lisboa.</p>
      <p>The race went green again three laps later, but only briefly.</p>
      <p>As the field filed into the Lisboa braking area Engel couldn't pull up his Mercedes, clipping Kelvin van der Linde's Audi before clattering into the back of an unsuspecting Mortara.</p>
      <p>The clean-up lasted until lap eight, setting up a four-lap battle between Marciello and Bamber.</p>
      <p>But while the Kiwi was able to shadow the GruppeM Mercedes there was no way past and Bamber was forced to settle for second with Vanthoor in third.</p>

      <p>Defending GT World Cup winner Augusto Farfus finished a fine fourth, coming all the way from 12th on the grid.</p>
      <p>The BMW driver was shuffled up the order as Vanthoor, Mortara, Engel and van der Linde had their issues, ending up fifth for the second restart.</p>
      <p>Farfus then executed a textbook move on Christopher Haase into Lisboa as the race went green.</p>
      <p>Haase finished sixth ahead of Alexandre Imperatori, with Charles Weerts seventh, Kevin Estre eighth, Joel Eriksson ninth and Adderly Fong 10th.</p>
      <p>Van der Linde was classified 13th, with repairs after the Engel incident having put him seven laps down.</p>
