        <b>Ghana U-23 goalkeeper Kwame Baah made the list for the top saves on Match Day 3 at the CAF U-23 Cup of Nations in Egypt. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The Asante Kotoko shot stopper produced two quick saves in the opening minutes of Ghana's win against Mali on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The double save prevented the Malians from taking the lead before a second half brace from Kwabena Owussu won the Black Meteors the game as the team progressed to the semi finals.</p>
      <p>Kwame Baah joins Nigeria goalkeeper Adamu Mohammed and Egypt shot stopper Mohammed Sobhy in the top three saves of the week.</p>
      <p>Adamu Mohammed's on the line finger tip save against South Africa and Sobhy's one on one clearance against Cameroon were the other top saves.</p>
      <p>Kwame Baah silence his critics with his performance against Mali after a disastrous showing on match day 2 against Egypt.</p>
      <p>Ghana will next play Ivory Coast on Tuesday and a win will see them qualify for the Olympic games in Tokyo 2020.</p>
