        <b>After being subjected to racist abuse in Romania, Sweden forward Alexander Isak labelled the incident as “incredibly sad”.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Alexander Isak was subjected to racist abuse as Sweden booked their spot at Euro 2020 with a win over Romania on Friday.</p>
      <p>Isak, 20, came off the bench during the win in Bucharest, with the game halted shortly after his 78th-minute introduction.</p>
      <p>While play was then allowed to continue, the Real Sociedad forward confirmed he had reported racist abuse to the referee, describing the incident as “incredibly sad”.</p>
      <p>“Of course it is sad for the moment, but at the same time we were prepared for such things to happen, even if it does not help in that way,” Isak told C More.</p>
      <p>“I think I could handle it well and the team’s support was incredible too.</p>
      <p>“We did well and it is incredibly sad that such things happen, but what should we do?”</p>
      <p>With one game remaining, Sweden (18 points) are second to Spain (23) in Group F, with both sides having already progressed.</p>
