      <p>MADRID: Footballers in Spain's women's league launched an indefinite strike on Friday (Nov 15) seeking to double the minimum wage to €16,000 (US$17,680), the players' union AFE announced.</p>
      <p>The Association of Women's Football Clubs (ACFF) believes the more modest clubs will be unable to afford wages with the minimum currently set at €8,000.</p>

      <p>Women are also trying to force through a maternity package, paid holidays and other basic fringe benefits.</p>
      <p>"We will be stopping full match-day programmes as of 16-17 November for an indefinite period, because we have tried all other methods of negotiation," the players' union said.</p>
      <p>The strike thereby sees the cancellation of this weekend's ninth round of the women's 16-team football league.</p>
      <p>Over the past 15 years women's participation in football in Spain has increased four-fold and there are 70 members of the ACFF.</p>
