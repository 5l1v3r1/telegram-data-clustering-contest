      <h1>Sow Your Seed Efficiently With This Multi-Way Drop Seeder</h1>

      <p>Anyone who has ever had to propagate small plants from seed will know that efficiently sowing seed can be a difficult process. Getting a consistent number of seed in each point while achieving any sort of speed is almost impossible, and as a result it becomes a tedious process. If only there were some means by which it could be automated, perhaps a way to do a whole tray at once!</p>
      <p>Fortunately [Michael Ratcliffe] is at hand, with <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/168051-drop-seeder-put-those-seeds-in-the-soil-quick">his tray-sized drop seeder.</a> It consists of two sheets of acrylic each with a grid of holes, offset from each other by able to be brought into alignment with a lever. Seed is shaken over the upper surface until all the holes contain some, and then the lever is operated allowing it to drop through into the soil below. There is a matching dibber if required to push the required grid of holes in the soil.</p>
      <p>It’s a simple yet ingenious gadget that genuinely will make the lives of horticulturalists a lot easier, even though it might not be perfect for all types of seed. He’s created a video which we’ve placed below the break, and should you wish to create the dibber <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/10/07/__trashed-7/">we’ve already covered it</a>.</p>
