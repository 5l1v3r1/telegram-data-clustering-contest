      <p>Thieves struck at a house in HSR Layout, while its inhabitants were out of the city, and decamped with gold and diamond jewelry, silver articles, electronic items along with the car parked in front of the house. In her complaint to the HSR Layout police, Savithri Nagaraj, 59, said that on November 3 she had locked her house and had gone to Mysuru. On November 10, when she returned home she was shocked to see that their car, which was parked in front of their house, was gone. “It was around 8:30 pm when I came home and the main door was open. I realised that someone had broken into it. The thieves ransacked the house and all the valuable items, including cash and car, were stolen,” she said. <br/><br/><br/>Her neighbours too did not notice that the car was missing. They told the police that the theft might have happened a day or two before she came back as they thought that she had already returned from her journey and had taken the car out. “There were no CCTV cameras in their building and we have collected the footage from the surrounding areas to identify the culprits,” said a police officer. Police said that they have given the worth of the stolen car as Rs. 5.5 lakh and they are yet to give the total amount of stolen items. Police said that the public should inform their trustworthy neighbours while they are planning on a long trip and ask them to be alert and inform them or the police if anything found suspicious. HSR Layout police have registered a case and are investigating.</p>
