      <h1>Trump Betrays the Military</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T00:41:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 00:41</time> by <a rel="author">Benjamin Haas</a></address>
      <p>President Donald Trump on Friday <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/us/trump-pardons.html?module=inline">cleared</a> three military service members of war crimes, even <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/us/politics/trump-military.html?module=inline">after</a> being reportedly advised against doing so by Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy. Mr. Trump interceded on behalf of Army Maj. Mathew Golsteyn, who had been charged with murdering an Afghan man; Edward Gallagher, a Navy SEAL who was convicted in connection with posing for a photo with the corpse of a fighter in Iraq; and Army First Lt. Clint Lorance, who, after nine fellow unit members <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/25/us/jailed-ex-army-officer-has-support-but-not-from-his-platoon.html?module=inline">testified against him</a>, had been convicted of murdering two civilians in Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>Mr. Trump may believe that intervening pays respect to those who have served in uniform, that it shows he’s “pro-military.” But if this is his view, he’s wrong. In reality, Mr. Trump’s meddling undermines the military’s institutional values, risks endangering American service members, and disrespects the honorable service of the overwhelming majority of veterans.</p>
      <p>The military strives to ensure that its members adhere to the <a href="https://www.icrc.org/en/doc/war-and-law/overview-war-and-law.htm">laws of war</a> and respect human rights. Service members are trained, for example, to avoid civilian casualties by understanding rules of engagement and following the proper steps for escalation of force. They also learn the appropriate ways to treat detainees, and interrogators are trained to employ only the approved, legal <a href="https://fas.org/irp/doddir/army/fm2-22-3.pdf">methods</a>.</p>
      <p>During my two deployments to Afghanistan, my intelligence work helped lead to the capture of insurgent leaders. Sharing responsibility for their capture and as a recipient of the intelligence produced by their interrogations, I had a sense of moral reassurance in the understanding that my colleagues handled and interrogated the detainees humanely — just as they had been trained.</p>
      <p>The lessons service members learn about the laws of war are not an afterthought. Rather, they are central, emphasized time and again — from training sessions and exercises, to military ethics discussions, to actual combat deployments. The <a href="https://www.army.mil/values/">Army’s official values</a>, after all, demand that soldiers “do what’s right, legally and morally” and “treat others with dignity and respect,” making no exceptions for civilians or even enemies.</p>
      <p>The military requires its members to operate in accordance with the laws of war for good reason. Disregarding the laws of war — which Mr. Trump has done by intervening in these cases — jeopardizes mission accomplishment and the safety of service members; <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3515908-Use-of-Force-Principles-FINAL.html">excessive civilian casualties</a>, for example, can stimulate further violence, turn local populations against American forces, and discourage allies from collaborating with the United States. Mr. Trump should realize that the laws of war actually serve to benefit our armed forces.</p>
      <p>Against this backdrop, Mr. Trump’s intervention on behalf of those convicted or accused of conduct falling short of the military’s crucial legal requirements and moral expectations undermines the training in which the military rightly invests so much effort. It trivializes the values the military spends so much time fostering. He could be endangering United States service members deployed to combat zones by handing their enemies propaganda and recruitment material and by degrading support among local populations.</p>
      <p>To be sure, war is complex, and service members accordingly face difficult moral choices under extraordinary pressure. But their preparation helps them make sound decisions in these tough situations, and the military justice system considers the factual circumstances of each case and the intent of the actor.</p>
      <p>Mr. Trump appears to be following in the unfortunate footsteps of President Richard Nixon. In the wake of Lt. William Calley’s murder conviction in connection with the Vietnam War’s <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/vietnam-war/my-lai-massacre-1">My Lai Massacre</a>, President Richard Nixon <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2019/05/25/he-was-americas-most-notorious-war-criminal-nixon-helped-him-anyway/">intervened</a> on behalf of Mr. Calley. In a response that rings true today, Capt. Aubrey Daniel, the military prosecutor in the case, <a href="https://blogs.baylor.edu/mylaimassacre/aubrey-daniel-letter/">wrote</a> the president:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“Your intervention has, in my opinion, damaged the military judicial syst</i>
        <i>em. … I w</i>
        <i>ould expect that the president of the United States, a man whom I believed should and would provide the moral leadership for this nation, would stand fully behind the law of this land on a moral issue which is so clear and about which there can be no compromise.”</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Mr. Trump, to the detriment of the United States Armed Forces, remains fixated on condoning the aberrant conduct of those convicted or accused of flouting the laws of war. He should have left the military justice system to do its job. But perhaps this is not surprising, considering that Mr. Trump himself has <a href="https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1194671109679046658">recently</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/11/05/trump-keeps-talking-about-keeping-middle-east-oil-that-would-be-illegal/">advocated</a> a war crime — the appropriation of oil in Syria.</p>
