      <p>It just so happens that Steam is having a huge sale on the Company of Heroes 2 DLC so if you fancy yourself an RTS fan, then this could be something great to invest in. All the DLC is currently 75% or you can purchase the entire pack for just R156 which includes 7 DLC packs. The original game, however, does include the single-player campaign as well as the multiplayer armies.</p>
