      <p>As of November 16th in 2003, soccer would never be the same again. On this date 16 years ago, a young Argentine named Lionel Messi, who had been described as ‘the little Maradona’ by Infantil B coach Xavi Lorens, made his FC Barcelona senior debut against Porto.</p>
      <p>The tie drew many parallels to the friendly the Blaugrana contested against FC Cartagena this week.</p>
      <p>The clash with the Portuguese giants then managed by Jose Mourinho on their way to that season’s Champions League crown was not held as a benefit match for flood victims, yet it was contested at a time when several members of the first team squad were representing their national teams.</p>
      <p>Just as Ernesto Valverde only took main six stars to Murcia with him for Wednesday’s encounter, Frank Rijkaard could count on the expertise of just five that were namely Rafael Marquez, Gabri, Xavi and Luises Enrique and Luis Garcia.</p>
      <p>According to SPORT’s David Salinas, the Dutchman had to ask his B team counterpart Pere Gratacós which players he could call upon for the tie and was told  ‘Take Leo. Don't even think about it .’ </p>
      <p>Then having already progressed to the Juvenile A outfit, Messi was included in Rijkaard’s matchday squad and obtained his first professional experiences in the north Portuguese coastal city aged just 16 years, four months and 24 days.</p>
      <p>Picked up as a 13-year-old with growth deficiency issues in his hometown of Rosario, a 71st minute replacement of Fernando Navarro was a crowning moment for not just Messi and his family, but also the club and the sport overall though we were all blisfully unaware at the time.</p>
      <p>Donning the number 14 jersey, Messi, as reproduced in the clip above, almost broke free in front of an open goal and fell short of squaring it to a teammate in space.</p>
      <p>Undoubtedly not the primary motive for the decision, with his tender years and need to further develop the most likely cause, Messi dropped back down to the youth categories following the 2-0 defeat but had already shown promising signs of his genius.</p>
      <p>Just 24 hours previously, he had scored a hat trick against Granollers in the Juvenil league and scored his first goal for the seniors in 0-6 away win at Palamos during the 2004-2005 preseason.</p>
      <p>Exactly 11 months after today’s game in question, a maiden La Liga appearance followed in the derbi barceloní on October 16, 2004 at Espanyol and a first Spanish domestic title was lifted in May.</p>
      <p>Then the talk of the town was Ronaldinho, FIFA’s World Player of the Year in ‘04 and ‘05 in addition to a Ballon d’Or winner in 2006, and under his tutelage, Messi further blossomed until taking centre stage at the start of Pep Guardiola’s ‘Tiki-taka’ dynasty at the close of the decade.</p>
      <p>More important than ever to his side as a 32-year-old, a seemingly endless highlight reel continues to see other-worldly expolits added to it, but it was on this autumn night in Porto that a shy teenager subtly announced himself to soccer fans with glimpses of what was yet to come.</p>
