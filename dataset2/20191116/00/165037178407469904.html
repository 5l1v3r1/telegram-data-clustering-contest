        <b>There are matches which sometimes hurt badly. Liverpool-Barcelona in the Champions League last season was one of them. The Reds overcame a three goal deficit to knock Barca out. Six months later, a video showing Valverde's reaction to the tough defeat at Anfield has come to light.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Only a few seconds of footage have been released, but it is enough to see how angry<b> the Barca coach was at being left out of the Champions League</b>. </p>
      <p>In the images, which will be broadcast on 'MATCHDAY', a series on 'Rakuten TV',<b> Valverde can be seen throwing his jacket</b>. It was an image showing his helplessness.</p>
      <p><b>You can also see the players looking extremely down</b>. <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/p-coutinho-65113">Coutinho</a> was covering his face, Busquets gazing into space...</p>
      <p>On the other hand, the coaching staff were trying to cheer up the footballers. <b>A night which Barcelona will not forget easily</b>. </p>
      <p>In this series on 'Rakuten TV', <b>the most intimate moments</b> of the Barca dressing room have still not come to light. In the six seconds which 'Sport' have chosen, <b>we can see the rollercoaster of emotions</b> which are seen on the field of play. </p>
