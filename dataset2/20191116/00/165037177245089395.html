        <b>Thorgan and Eden. Eden and Thorgan. Between them they helped lead Belgium to victory against a non-existent Russia in attack. Romelu Lukaku, in the second half, joined the party to get them to first position.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Belgium showed that they are<b> a national team in the best form</b> on the whole continent. Nine wins out of a possible nine, 27 points out of a possible 27 and joint first place in their group.</p>
      <p>Roberto Martinez's side had patience to arm the attack and they relied on <b>one of the most talent families in football today</b>. Between Thorgan and Eden, they managed to get the win.</p>
      <p>Despite <b>some early chances from Russia,</b> who didn't find the target once in the match, it was Belgium who commanded the whole match. And they did it to the sound of an Eden Hazard who smiles again.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Eden show</b>
      </p>
      <p>The talented attacker was in charge of giving the ball to Thorgan. As if they <b>were still playing in the school yard</b>, the two brothers combined so that the Borussia Dortmund player, with a great right footed strike, got the first goal.</p>
      <p><b>Eden also wanted to be on the scoresheet</b>, so in the space of seven minutes he scored a double. The first ball came after Lukaku's header, with a shot from the front, and then with a counter-attack culminated by the Real Madrid player after a great pass from Kevin de Bruyne.</p>

      <p>Belgium left the game feeling pretty good after the first half and were<b> dedicated to finishing off the game </b>in the second half. Roberto Martinez's men took their foot off the accelerator while arguing their victory in a good defence.</p>
      <p><b>Lukaku joined the party</b> with another goal from Eden then Romelu. From the right, the Inter Milan striker went all the way to the edge to unleash a powerful shot that sealed a 4-0 advantage,</p>
      <p>
        <b>The reaction came late</b>
      </p>
      <p>Russia, who were 0-4 down,<b> tried to get a consolation goal</b>. Cherchésov's side, with an offer of renewal at the table, were able to give their fans a little joy.</p>
      <p><b>Belgium's concentration fell </b>and Russia took advantage of it to make the final score1-4, thanks to Dzhikiya. He was able to score more in the final straight, but it was too late to dream of a late comeback.</p>
