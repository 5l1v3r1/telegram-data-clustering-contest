      <p>Enlightened Christian Gathering leader, Prophet Shepherd Bushiri has instructed his Botswana churches to suspend church gatherings pending re registration of  the church in the neighbouring country.</p>
      <p>In a statement issued by ECG spokespersons Ephraim Nyondo, Maynard Manyowa and  Terrance Baloyi the church said, “The indefinite suspension of services is to allow  the finalisation of the re-registrative process to satisfy every compliance expectation.”</p>
      <p>The church has urged congregants to visit South Africa for services.</p>
      <p>Bushiri is expected to travel to Botswana to relaunch the church.</p>
