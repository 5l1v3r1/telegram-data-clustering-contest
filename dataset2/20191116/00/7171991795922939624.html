      <h1>This Is The Bike You Wanted Your Dad To Make You When You Were Eight Years Old!</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T00:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://hackaday.com/author/jennylist/" target="_blank">Jenny List</a></address>
      <p>The ever-resourceful [Turbo Conquering Mega Eagle] has an excellent excuse for starting on projects, he’s building them for his kids and making videos. We’re not so sure his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlLdWbAMgGs">little motorcycle</a> wasn’t built because Dad also wants to have a go though, because it seems he had quite a lot of fun testing it.</p>
      <p>The build starts with a Chinese petrol conversion kit for a bicycle. There’s a little <s>two</s>four-stroke motor and a basic chain drive to a large sprocket intended to fit on the opposite side of a bicycle wheel to the pedal sprocket. He uses a pair of pneumatic wheelbarrow wheels for which he makes a new bush and to which he welds the sprocket. These go into a fairly simple hardtail frame for which he makes a padded motorcycle seat, and from then on he’s ready to go.</p>
      <p>The result is a rather cool little non-road-legal motorcycle that we suspect most readers will have a hankering to own. We’re not so sure about its seeming lack of brakes though. Judge for yourself, the video is below the break.</p>
      <p>This isn’t the first home made small bike we’ve brought you, though it’s a lot safer than <a href="https://hackaday.com/2016/07/12/fail-of-the-week-how-not-to-build-your-own-motorcycle/">the first one</a>.</p>
