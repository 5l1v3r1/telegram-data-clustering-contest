      <p>Many years ago, my mother was a young student in biology class, learning about blood types, how they combined, and how they were passed on. The laboratory part of the class involved testing your own blood, and identifying your own blood type. There was one little problem though, with the results my mother discovered. Her father, a WW-II veteran of the Pacific theater knew his blood type, it was on the dogtags my mother grew up seeing on her father’s dresser. Her mother was a nurse, who had shared her bloodtype with my mother. The problem was, the results didn’t seem to match up in any way, with my mother’s. She went to her teacher, sure she must have done something wrong. Her teacher had the sad news of informing her that her father didn’t appear to be her biological father.</p>
      <p>Today, modern <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/genetics">genetics</a> testing, the technological descendant of my mother’s bloodtype testing, is revealing similar secrets to surprised people across the globe. There’s even a new term created to describe these discoveries: “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-paternity_event">Non Paternity Events</a>” (NPE), identify places where people have found that their male relative was not actually their genetic progenitor.</p>
      <p>23andme, MyHeritage and Ancestry.com offer inexpensive, easy and accessible test results, with a variety of different approaches. None offer or require individual <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapy-types/coaching">counseling</a> about the results, but all inform customers that results sometimes reveal startling and uncomfortable secrets.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>One man did genetic testing to discover more about his father, who’d died many years ago. Unfortunately, genetics results revealed that the man he’d been raised by wasn’t his father. Instead, his father was a well-known East Coast mobster. Stunned, he posted the discovery on Facebook. An urgent phone call from his mother convinced him to delete the post, as she now revealed the secret history of his birth and heritage, which she’d hidden to protect him, his family and the man who had raised him.</li>
        <li>Nikki discovered an unknown half-aunt through genetic testing, who was on the site researching her own health issues. Nikki assumed the woman was a close relative she hadn’t known. It turned out that the woman was the child of a woman who had lived next door to NIkki’s grandparents, and had been <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/child-development">childhood</a> best friends with Nikki’s grandmother.</li>
        <li>Paolo grew up in a large family. His grandparents had 18 children. At his grandfather’s funeral, a woman appeared with her two children and shared that they were children of Paolo’s grandfather. When Paolo later did genetic testing, they discovered their grandfather had three more children by two other women. They are waiting to find out if there are more to be discovered.</li>
        <li>A very good friend of mine was literally on the genetics testing website, showing the results to his father, when up popped results indicating that a man whose results had been newly added to the data, was my friend’s unknown son. Decades ago, as a graduate student in New York, my friend had been a sperm donor. Now, technology introduced my friend and his father, to their son and grandson.</li>
        <li>Pam knew she was adopted as a baby, and did genetics testing expecting to learn something about her ethnic heritage. Instead, the program immediately introduced her to her biological father. "I was shocked. No warning. Just click, click. I expected to find out I was Irish, French? Instead, here's your father. He died a few years ago, but lived only an hour away from me. He was the only one in his family who did genetic testing, but he has two other children." Now, Pam is wrestling with whether she should reach out to her siblings, who she is sure don't know she ever existed. What will that do to them, and their beliefs about their shared father?</li>
        <li>Jay grew up knowing his Cajun grandfather's family had a diverse history, but was surprised when genetic testing revealed he was 30% Italian. He sent the results to his mother, who called him immediately, and revealed her secret, lifelong suspicions about an Italian family that she'd grown up knowing as family friends, but who had suddenly distanced themselves from her family, for reasons she never knew. His mother was relieved to finally have an explanation for why she never felt like she fit in with her older siblings. The testing results delivered these explosive secrets only a few months after the death of the man Jay had been raised with as his maternal grandfather, and as the family is now dealing with complex legal matters related to his estate. To avoid making these matters even more complex, Jay and his mother have kept the results secret for now. Before telling me this story, Jay had never told anyone about this, and was surprised what a burden it was, and how much relief he felt after sharing it.</li>
        <li>Years ago, I counseled several men who learned, late in life, that their older sisters had actually been their mothers. In older generations, this was a common familial response to teenage pregnancies, as a means to protect the teens from the lifelong consequences of such births. Sadly these strategies were also often used to conceal incidents of incest and sexual abuse. In <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/therapy">therapy</a>, we explored how these revelations affected my patients’ identities, and their feelings towards their parents/grandparents and their sisters/mothers.</li>
        <li>This delightfully detailed <a href="https://dna-explained.com/2019/01/22/caution-invisible-fathers-and-autosomal-matching-whos-hiding-in-your-dna/">blogpost </a>describes the complex history of two men in Virginia, Marcus and Thomas, whose true relationship was lost in history, but recently revealed through genetic testing. Marcus, it turned out, was likely the illegitimate son of one of Thomas’ younger sisters. Thomas had become the guardian of his sisters after the death of their parents, and then raised Marcus as his nephew/foster-son.</li>

      <p><a href="https://www.msn.com/en-gb/lifestyle/relationships/whos-the-daddy-paternity-mixed-up-in-cities-study-finds/ar-BBWKM6m">Maarten Larmuseau</a> is a European researcher who recently studied paternity in Europe through examination of the <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/x-y-chromosomes">y chromosome</a> in men whose ancestral records indicated heritage relationships to other European men. But Larmuseau’s results revealed that in city-dwellers from the Industrial Revolution, rates of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/infidelity">infidelity</a> and non paternity events, were as high as 6%. Past research has suggested that in a given year, around 2-3% of live births are the result of infidelity of some kind, and not the children of the fathers of records. In cases where infidelity is suspected, rates of non paternity rise much, much higher, as high as 20-30%, confirming those gut suspicions.</p>
      <p>Today, we have the ability to learn more about our history, than ever before. The question is, how will we deal with these truths, and how will we rewrite our understanding of ourselves and our families?</p>
      <p>Decades ago, my mother was faced with a complex and challenging discovery. The secret she learned changed her sense of self, and altered, irrevocably, her relationship with my grandmother. But, her relationship with the man who’d raised her was unchanged. At the end of his life, my mother cared for him, and I believe he likely passed away, never knowing the truth that my mother had found revealed in her blood. Had he known, I don’t know if it would have changed anything, or if he would have learned the same truth that my mother did: family is about far more than just blood and genes.</p>
