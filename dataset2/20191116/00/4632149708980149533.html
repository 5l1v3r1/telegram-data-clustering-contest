      <h1>Road along Madiwala Lake needs to be built ASAP</h1>

      <p>The residents of BTM layout 2nd stage have been demanding that the 25 feet road connecting road BTM layout 2nd stage to Roopena Agarhara, which runs along the Madiwala Lake, be completed. Residents complain that BTM Layout has become chaotic and polluted because a large number of vehicles pass through this stretch every day. <br/><br/>This one-kilometre stretch begins from BTM layout near Madiwala Lake, goes to the lake boundary of lake and connects Hosur Road. The work has been going on for over four years but has not been completed yet. The residents complain since this road hasn’t been completed, vehcles move through BTM Layout and traffic piles up on the Outer Ring Road via Central Silk Board junction. <br/><br/>The officials state various reasons for the delay in this road construction project. Shivaraman, secretary of Spandana residents forum said, “Commuters moving from Central Silk Board towards JP Nagar use the Bank Employees Layout road and due to this the residents face a lot of sound and air pollution.” <br/><br/><br/>Bommanahalli MLA Sathish Reddy said that that he has asked the Karnataka CM BS Yediyurappa to sanction the conversion of this 25 feet road to a 50 feet road. This road was sanctioned in 2015 after a tedious approval process from the state government. Sathish Reddy, Bommanahalli MLA, said, “This project was delayed as Karnataka’s Forest department was holding the project’s file for over two years before sanctioning it. The bridges towards Hosur Road is ready but a few parts of this road is yet to be finished,” <br/><br/>He added, “Some of the land owners are not ready to part with their land that will be required for widening this road. Land owners are not agreeing to the TDR amount. They want an amount as per the BMRCL’s land acquiring policy. The bridge and other walls will be completed within 20 days. The road laying and widening process will be done once the TDR money is released.” <br/><br/><br/>Parveez Pasha, a resident of BTM Layout said, “We request the CM to intervene in this matter so that this road is completed. The residents of JP Nagar, BTM Layout and Bilekahalli can take this road to reach Hosur Road and they can avoid the Silk Board junction.”</p>
