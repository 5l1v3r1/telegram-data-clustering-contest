Magomedsharipov was hindered by an infection and faded a little in the third frame, but there is little doubt that he ranks among the most interesting contenders at 145 pounds. Whether he gets a shot at the <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Max-Holloway-38671">Max Holloway</a>-<a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Alexander-Volkanovski-101527">Alexander Volkanovski</a> winner next remains to be seen, but for now, the rising star moves up one spot to sixth in our latest featherweight poll.<br/><br/>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Alexander-Volkov-40951">Alexander Volkov</a> put together a conservative-yet-effective performance in the UFC Moscow co-main event, as he outpointed short-notice foe <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Greg-Hardy-271461">Greg Hardy</a>. Volkov, who was originally supposed to face <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Junior-dos-Santos-17272">Junior dos Santos</a> in the evening’s headliner, seemed content to pick his adversary apart with straight punches and kicks at range for his seventh victory in his last eight pro appearances. A win over dos Santos would’ve been cause for movement, but for now Volkov stays put at No. 7 in the heavyweight rankings.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Arlene-Blencowe-131845">Arlene Blencowe</a> continues to compile a solid 145-pound resume, as she took a clear unanimous verdict over UFC veteran <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Leslie-Smith-46542">Leslie Smith</a> at Bellator 233. “Angerfist” has won six of her last seven bouts and remains entrenched at No. 4 in the women’s featherweight poll. Also at featherweight, we bid adieu to <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Holly-Holm-75125">Holly Holm</a>, whose last 145-pound appearance came in a decision win over <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Megan-Anderson-149769">Megan Anderson</a> in June 2018.<br/><br/><b>Continue Reading »</b> <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/news/rankings/2/Sherdogs-Official-Mixed-Martial-Arts-Rankings-165533">Heavyweight</a></p>
