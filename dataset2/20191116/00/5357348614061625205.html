      <p><b>ST JOHN'S, Antigua (CMC) – The High Court will sentence the stepfather of a 12-year-old child on January 24 next year after he pleaded guilty to having sex with her two years ago.</b><br/><br/>The man, who appeared before Justice Ian Morley, admitted to having sex with his underaged stepdaughter in 2017 and pleaded guilty to the charge of unlawful sexual intercourse with a female under the age of 14 contrary to Section 5 of the Sexual Offences Act.<br/><br/>The court heard that the sexual offence occurred on December 17, 2017, but that he had been interfering with the child a year earlier.<br/><br/>Media reports said that the man, who was not named, continued having sexual intercourse with the child, who had a breakdown in class in January this year.<br/><br/>The girl told her classmate about her stepfather and the man was subsequently arrested after her mother made a report to the police.</p>
