      <h1>Gabriel Ibitoye's Run For Harlequins Try Was Out Of This World</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T00:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Gary Connaughton</a></address>
      <p>While the result would not go their way in the game against Clermont Auvergne, Harlequins will be happy with what they saw from Gabriel Ibitoye today.</p>
      <p>The 21-year old is a major prospect with his mix of power and pace a deadly combination on the wing. Having starred for the England U20s in recent times, we would guess it will not be too long before he is given an opportunity at senior level.</p>
      <p>While James Lang would score the try, Ibitoye set up the score with an incredible solo run. He showed some unbelievable footwork to evade the Clermont defence, carrying the ball from his own half right up to the other end of pitch before offloading it to his teammate.</p>
      <p>Take a look at this.</p>

      <p>Outrageous.</p>
      <p>It has been a difficult season for Harlequins thus far, winning only one of their opening four games in the Premiership. Couple that with a heavy defeat to Clermont and you get what has been a rather disastrous campaign.</p>
      <p>Their Champions Cup group also contains Ulster and Bath, who played out a <a href="https://www.balls.ie/rugby/stockdale-stop-ulster-bath-420358">dramatic game</a> earlier today.</p>
