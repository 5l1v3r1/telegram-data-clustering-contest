      <p>CAMPOBELLO, S.C. (AP) - Authorities say two horses have recently been stabbed in northern South Carolina and investigators are trying to figure out if the attacks are related.</p>
      <p>In the most recent incident, a quarter horse named Trigg was cut on the leg down to the bone and was slashed so deep on the stomach that its intestines were coming out at a Campobello pasture, owner Ann McGinnis told the Herald-Journal.</p>
      <p>“I thought maybe it was an accident at first,” McGinnis told the newspaper. “I thought maybe he cut (his leg) on a branch or something. I didn’t think it was that serious.”</p>

      <p>Spartanburg County animal control officials said this is the second horse in the county to be cut and stabbed. They did not release details on the other attack.</p>
      <p>Mike McCarter buried Trigg after the horse was euthanized. He said the slashings have other horse owners in the area worried.</p>
      <p>“This bothers me,” McCarter said. “I don’t understand why anyone would want to do this. This is senseless.”</p>
