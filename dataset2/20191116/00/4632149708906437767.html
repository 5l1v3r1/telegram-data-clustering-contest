      <h1>Not the Wolf of Wall Street?</h1>

      <p><i>Rajat Gupta, who was convicted of insider trading, puts up a fierce defence for himself in his book, Mind Without Fear. He was here for the Bangalore Literature Festival and told BM that he wouldn’t live his life any other way</i> <br/><br/>Much of Rajat Gupta’s success, he believes, came from his belief in people. “I believed in people’s capacity to do the right thing. My value system made other people successful and in turn, they made me successful,” he says over a phone call. Ironically, he believes this very faith contributed to his 2012 arrest on charges of securities fraud. In a sensational fall from grace, Gupta – Indian export to the US who was orphaned at the age of 18 in Kolkata and went on to hold the post of the first foreign-born managing director of McKinsey during a glittering 37-year-old career – found himself behind bars for two years. It was a trial that irreparably damaged his image as the proverbial golden boy from India and a global heavyweight, and vilified him as a symptom of Wall Street greed. But Gupta remains defiant, maintaining he is innocent – a victim of bad timing and some crucial oversights. “People let me down, yes. But I wouldn’t live my life any other way,” he says. <br/><br/>That curious mix of philosophy and belligerence pervades Gupta’s memoir, Mind Without Fear, which he referenced at the Bangalore Literature Festival last weekend. It is his truth, one he never told publicly because he did not testify at his trial. “It is one of my biggest regrets,” he admits. “I don’t know if it would have changed the outcome, but you can’t worry about that. You can only do your best, and if it doesn’t work out, you just accept it.” But his best was not enough. He was charged with passing information about Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s $5 billion investment in Goldman Sachs to billionaire hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam, on the basis of a phone call he made to the latter just 16 seconds after a crucial Goldman Sachs board meeting in 2008.</p>
      <p>People say this has destroyed my reputation. But in a way I was distanced from my reputation. What matters to me is that I did the right thing ­</p>
      <p>–Rajat Gupta<br/><br/><br/>When Rajaratnam started buying the company’s shares, and was richer by over $8,00,000 the next day, telling someone on a wire-tapped phone call that he had heard “something good might happen to Goldman,” the needle of suspicion pointed squarely at Gupta. <br/><br/>Gupta says in the book and reiterates over the phone that the evidence, purely circumstantial, does not add up. “To be an insider trader, you should have passed on confidential information; you should have done it with criminal intent as part of a quid pro quo; you should have received some benefit in return. They had no direct evidence of me passing on information, nor could they prove the other charges.” <br/><br/>Still, Gupta found himself in prison, and twice, in solitary confinement for fashioning a pillow out of towels, and bending to tie his shoelaces during the daily count. Acceptance was his only choice. Clutching the Bhagavad Gita (“I told the guard it was my Bible”), he endured seven weeks of “torture”, trying to keep his head above water and his mind without fear, as he later titled his book. “Deciding not to testify came from a moment of fear. Like Arjuna, I was hesitant to fight. Mind without Fear [from Rabindranath Tagore’s poem], refers to both, moments when I succumbed to fear and those when I acted despite it,” he says. Memories of how his father ‘moved through the world with detachment’ kept him going, and in the end, he left with lessons on equanimity and courage. “People say this has destroyed my reputation. But in a way I was distanced from my reputation. What matters to me is that I did the right thing. Action with complete detachment – that’s how I want to live my life.”</p>

      <p>Some moments from Rajat Gupta’s life</p>
      <p>Of course, detachment isn’t that easy to achieve. There is deep “disappointment” at McKinsey’s treatment of him (he has been struck off the alumni list) and anger at US attorney Preet Bharara (“It is known that he did nothing about bankers responsible for the financial crisis, despite having damning evidence; it didn’t stop him from going after me without any real evidence,” Gupta says). Had his trial happened today and not at the height of the 2008 financial crisis, the outcome could have been different, Gupta believes. “People were angry and had lost their pensions. The public was after extracting blood, so the prosecutors wanted to charge a highly visible name like mine,” he states. He adds, “America is where I built my career, it’s where my children live. I have much loyalty towards it, as I do for India, the country of my birth. But the American criminal justice system is flawed. It failed me.” So did the government. “They are after a win at any cost, they are not after the truth. They will manipulate witnesses, and the rules of decency do not apply.”</p>

      <p>Gupta says he was overstretched, and that was another big mistake. “I was involved in way too many things. If I lent my name to something, I gave it 100%. As a result I was ridiculously busy and not paying attention to detail.” He argues that in his tightly-scheduled days, he even used brief breaks to return phone calls. In those days, many of those were to Rajaratnam, with whom he had co-founded Voyager Capital. He was trying to figure out ‘what happened to my $10 million investment’ in the fund, he says in the book. “They were not calls to pass on tips. There’s nothing more than what meets the eye – it was an unfortunate confluence of events.” In the book, Gupta claims he had resigned from the Goldman Sachs board in September 2008, but came back as a gesture of benevolence to shore up the company’s goodwill as rumours swirled about Lehmann Brothers’ imminent collapse. To non-believers he says, “The press announcement of my resignation had been drafted. If I hadn’t gone back, I wouldn’t have been at that fateful board meeting and none of this would have happened. Why would I go back and then commit a crime, after an unblemished career? It defies logic.” <br/><br/>Today, Gupta seems poised between anger and acceptance. His appeal to overturn his conviction has been thrown out, and he has focused on his philanthropic work, and time with his family, whom he speaks of fondly in the book as his strength and solace. Writing the book was difficult – “especially the case, because I was reliving what I could have done differently”, but also “satisfying”. “I’ve received so many emails from readers who were moved by the book. Take my name out, and it will still be an interesting story. And if people can relate to parts of that story, that’s great,” he says. Even as his own story looks forward, he remains in touch with the past – specifically Mani and Manny, the friends he made in prison who, he mentions in the book, helped keep him going. “They’re out, and I’ve been helping them get reintegrated into society,” he says. If people were his Waterloo, as he claims, they also seem to remain a big part of his life.</p>
