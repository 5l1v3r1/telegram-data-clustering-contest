      <p>A 10-year-old girl has come out to accuse her uncle of defiling her since she was six-years-old.</p>
      <p>According to Abi [not her real name], her uncle, whose name was only given as David, would fondle her breasts and her genitals when her parents were out of the house.</p>
      <p>She said her uncle would give her gifts to perform sexual acts on him.</p>
      <p>“He gave me ¢10 to play with his penis,” she said.</p>
      <p>She claims David made her watch pornographic videos on his phone before engaging her in any sexual activity.</p>
      <p>According to Abi, she decided to report the incident only after her teacher had taught her class to resist any elderly person who tried to play with their genitals.</p>
      <p>“That was when I learnt all that my uncle had been doing to me was very bad,” she told Joy News.</p>
      <p>According to a medical report cited by JoyNews, Abi is battling a sexually transmitted infection, Gonorrhea.</p>
      <p>The report by doctors at the Anyaa Government hospital also revealed her hymen is broken.</p>
      <p>However, the decision to have the culprit prosecuted is causing a rift in the family, whilst the perpetrator is on the run from the police.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Abi’s mother, she said David had admitted to his wrongdoing and had asked to be forgiven. Also, he had offered to cater for Abi’s hospital bills.</p>
      <p>David’s grandfather had also requested for the issue to be settled amicably at home without the involvement of the police.</p>
      <p>For now, the Anyaa Police has begun investigating the matter.</p>
      <p>But mother of the ten-year-old said she’s hopeful the matter would be dealt with speedily.</p>
      <p>“We hope the police would speed up the prosecution if he’s found”</p>
      <p>Abi said, “I want them to catch him and send him to jail because he has hurt me”.</p>
