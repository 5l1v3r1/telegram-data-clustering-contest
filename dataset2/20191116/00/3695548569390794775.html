        <b>Charles Leclerc has said his Ferrari Formula 1 car was fast enough to top Brazilian Grand Prix qualifying and only a "stupid" mistake on his part prevented it.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Pole position would not have been possible for Leclerc at Interlagos because he was carrying a 10-place grid penalty for a change of internal combustion engine necessitated by his Austin practice oil leak.</p>
      <p>He ended up fourth fastest in Q3, so will start 14th.</p>
      <p>But he was convinced he could have topped the session so he could "only be angry" with himself for the result.</p>
      <p>"I'm very disappointed about my lap in Q3. The first timed lap I think was good enough for pole, or second but very close," said Leclerc.</p>
      <p>"I did a big mistake in the last corner which cost me three or four tenths so it's completely my fault and I need to learn from this.</p>
      <p>"The team did a great job, I think the car was there to to fight for pole at least and I didn't do the job in the car so I'm disappointed."</p>
      <p>He described his strategy for race day as "full attack mode".</p>

      <p>Having got through to Q3 on medium tyres while all the other top team drivers used softs, Leclerc can at least start the race on an alternative strategy.</p>
      <p>"We'll be starting on a harder compound than the top 10 so hopefully we can take advantage of that and come back through," he said.</p>
      <p>"Only time will tell but I will give it everything. I'll try to be as aggressive as I can in the first few laps, which will be very important, and then hopefully the pace will help us to come back further up in the standings."</p>
