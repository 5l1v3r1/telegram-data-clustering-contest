      <h1>Collect Moves To Somerset House For Its 16th Edition in 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T00:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Roddy Clarke</a></address>
      <p>Founded in 2004 by <a href="https://www.craftscouncil.org.uk/">The Crafts Council</a>, Collect brings together, on an annual basis, a wealth of international artists, designers and craftspeople showcasing a vast array of work. Previously held at <a href="https://www.saatchigallery.com/">The Saatchi Gallery</a>, next year’s event will be held at the historic <a href="https://www.somersethouse.org.uk/">Somerset House</a>, running from 27th February through to 1st March and will represent over 400 artists from a selection of galleries across the globe.</p>

      <p>The art fair, sponsored by the <a href="https://www.loewe.com/eur/en/about_loewefoundation">Loewe Foundation</a> and <a href="https://coxlondon.com/">Cox London</a>, will be housed in the large gallery wings at Somerset House, overlooking the Edmond J. Safra Fountain Court.

      <p>Fair director, Isobel Dennis, is looking forward to the relocation. “After five years at the V&amp;A and ten years at the Saatchi Gallery, it felt like a good time to move to a new venue as it allows the fair to evolve and grow.” She states, “We considered many different types of venue suitable for an art fair such as Collect, and after much consideration, Somerset House is absolutely the right cultural fit and environment to be holding the event.”</p>
      <p>With Somerset House hosting many events throughout each year, this cultural center provides the perfect backdrop in which to appreciate such calibre of work. “Collect is about the new, the modern, the contemporary, and places craft in a fine art context which it truly embraces and is often outstanding within.” Dennis continues, “2020 will be no different where the work at Collect will surprise and delight. From those using centuries-old processes to those pioneering new techniques and merging disciplines, year on year the fair attracts galleries who represent the most prolific and respected artists.”</p>

      <p>New galleries and artists will be welcomed for this edition bringing many highlights to the visitors. The work of artist <a href="http://gallerysklo.co.kr/en/sklo_artist/2864/?ckattempt=1">Joon-Yong Kim</a>, recently shortlisted for the <a href="http://craftprize.loewe.com/">Loewe Craft Prize</a>, will be on display, as well as a curated selection of pieces from the <a href="https://www.qest.org.uk/">Queen Elizabeth’s Scholarship Trust</a> (QEST) to celebrate 30 years of British craftsmanship. <a href="https://www.ting-ying.com/">Ting Ying</a> gallery will also be showcasing work from the iconic English potter, Carol McNicoll, who has been crucial within the development of the British ceramics world since the 1970s.</p>

      <p>For the Crafts Council, in light of their upcoming 50th anniversary in 2021, a new announcement is also on the cards. They will be opening the front of their Headquarters, a space within a former 19th chapel, as a Gallery for the first time; introducing the UK home for Craft. Working with architects <a href="http://www.theaoc.co.uk/">AOC</a> to renovate and restore the Grade 2 listed building on Pentonville Road, it will be ready for opening at the end of March 2020 with the official public opening taking place during <a href="https://www.londoncraftweek.com/">London Craft Week</a> in April 2020. With more gallery space and a public library, they will be announcing the forthcoming annual programme over the Spring season. Their own collection of 1,700 objects, amassed over the last half century, will be on display with a variety of exhibitions, talks, workshops and demonstrations being included in the schedule.</p>

      <p>These annual craft highlights help to remind us of the talent and depth of skill which lies behind each piece. With Collect drawing global attention from art consultants, collectors and curators alike, it provides opportunities for artists to make valuable connections. “The goals behind the fair each year are to select and support specialist craft and design galleries and dealers worldwide who represent highly talented artists, giving unparalleled access to view and buy their exceptional work.” says Dennis. “In addition, what sets the fair apart is the majority of the galleries taking part will have their own room in which to create their signature and environment.” Earmarked as a highlight at the beginning of the international cultural calendar, this investment into timeless craft not only supports artists from all over the world, but also helps to keep these valuable skillsets, and the passion for them, alive.</p>
