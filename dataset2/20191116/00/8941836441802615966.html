      <p>HONG KONG (AP) - Police have fired tear gas at protesters holding out at Hong Kong Polytechnic University as overnight clashes resumed in the morning.</p>
      <p>A large group of people arrived Sunday to try to clean up a debris-strewn roadway. Riot police appeared after the cleaners were warned away by the protesters.</p>
      <p>The police shot volleys of tear gas toward the protesters, who sheltered behind a wall of umbrellas across an entire street.</p>
