      <h1>Why Telkom is selling 34 properties in a big auction</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T00:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/jamie-mckane" target="_blank">Jamie McKane</a></address>
      <p>Telkom <a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/business/326035-telkom-to-sell-34-properties-in-big-auction.html"><b>recently announced</b></a> through auction partner GoIndustry that it would hold an auction for 34 properties.</p>
      <p>GoIndustry said the 34 lots include commercial and industrial buildings across the country, and the auction will be held online.</p>
      <p>“For this particular sale, the properties are being sold via our specialised online auction platform, which is… suited to accommodate bidders located across the country,” said GoIndustry.</p>
      <p>“This is an extensive portfolio, including single-storey buildings used for telecommunications in the past, as well as vacant land with development potential.”</p>
      <p>The properties mostly feature industrial single-storey buildings, with a wide variety of zoning classifications, added the company.</p>
      <p>Bidding for the lots will close on 26 November 2019 at 14:00, with viewing by appointment only.</p>
      <h3>Telkom property plans</h3>
      <p>We asked Telkom why its subsidiary, Gyro, had opted to auction off these properties.</p>
      <p>“Part of Gyro Group’s strategic mandate is to unlock value and minimise property operating costs in the Telkom Group property portfolio,” Telkom said.</p>
      <p>“Non-core Telkom owned properties and properties that cannot be repurposed for the business or has no property development potential will be disposed.”</p>
      <p>When asked whether Telkom would sell more buildings going forward, the company said it would dispose of more properties if necessary.</p>
      <p>“The property portfolio will be continuously evaluated and if future properties don’t meet the criteria, similar disposal processes will be followed,” the company said.</p>
      <p>In its interim results for the six months ended 30 September 2019, Telkom said it was evaluating the feasibility of 156 properties.</p>
      <p>“Non-core properties not suitable for operational use or development and redevelopment are in the process of disposal or repurposing,” Telkom said.</p>
      <p>“Approximately 156 properties are being evaluated, of which 34 have been identified as ‘properties held for sale’. Some of the properties will be up for sale during the financial year.”</p>
      <p>The company said that to reduce property occupancy expenditure for Telkom and its subsidiaries, it is consolidating office and warehouse space in major cities.</p>
      <p>Photos of the properties listed for sale are posted below.</p>
