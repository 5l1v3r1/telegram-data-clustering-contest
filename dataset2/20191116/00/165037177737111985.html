        <b>The France national team coach, Didier Deschamps, will manage his 100th game in charge of 'Les Bleus' this Sunday, against Albania. The coach arrived in 2012 and six years later led France to become World Champions!</b>
      </p>
      <p>When he was put in charge of France, few could imagine that <b>Didier Deschamps</b> would make history leading his side, but the coach, with more national team games (99 at the moment, 100 against Albania) managed to make history.</p>
      <p>His record as 'Les Bleus' coach is truly remarkable, with<b> 64 wins, 18 draws and 17 defeats</b>. Their goal difference is <b>+111</b> (194 in favour and 83 against). Moreover, the team have also <b>managed to get 44 clean sheets.</b></p>

      <p>As shown by 'AS', Deschamps also has a shot at becoming <b>the longest-lasting French coach</b>, if he remains in charge of the national team until 2020, as he will have been in charge for <b>eight years.</b></p>
      <p>France's aim in the last match of this Euro 2020 Qualifier is to <b>finish by being top of their group.Â </b>Their two-point lead over second-placed <b>Turkey</b> makes them dependent on themselves, so if they win they will be assured of leadership.</p>
