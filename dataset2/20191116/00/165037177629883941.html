        <b>The President of the French Federation (FFF), Noel Le Graet, publically stated that Karim Benzema will no longer play for the national team. The Madrid striker has responded to him.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/k-benzema-3318/">"Karim Benzema</a> is a very good player, I never questioned his qualities. He is one of the best players in his position but<b> his time with France is over,"</b> Le Graet stated bluntly to 'RMC Sport'.</p>
      <p>The<b> 'Valbuena case'</b> and other anti-sporting episodes have closed the door for Benzema withe France. He has not been called up for 'Les Bleus' since October 2015. <b>This is more than 4 years without wearing the national team shirt.</b> Benzema even said that Didier Deschamps had listened to racist interests and that was why he was not called up.</p>

      <p>Despite the fact that Benzema is having one of the best times in his already successful, sporting career, France will not count on him.<b> Le Graet's words made the footballer respond and he did not remain silent.</b></p>
      <p>"Noel, I thought that you would not interfere with the coach's decisions. Bear in mind that<b> I, and only I, will say when my international career ends</b>. If you believe that I have finished, let me play for another country that I am eligible to play for and we will see," Benzema responded.</p>
      <p>The Madrid striker has Algerian origins and could obtain Spanish nationality for the years worked in the white club.<b> FIFA would not, however, allow </b>Benzema to play for another country because he has already been international for France, which he has represented in several official tournaments. </p>
