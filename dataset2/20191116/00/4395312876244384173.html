      <p>The path to better health and wellness starts and ends from within. No amount of makeovers, modifications, and fashion overhauls will replace the power and potency of improving our physical health and mental wellbeing. With that said, the role of outward appearance in helping foster self-confidence and creating a success-oriented mindset cannot be denied. Generally speaking, people feel their best when they look their best.</p>
      <p>While other factors contribute to our outward appearance, <a href="https://thriveglobal.com/tags/clothing/">clothing</a> is perhaps the most noticeable. It’s also the factor we can alter the easiest. With this in mind, let’s look at how to make sure your clothes fit better:</p>
      <h3>Finding Clothes That Fit: Stick to the Brands You Know and Trust</h3>
      <p>There is a reason why brand loyalty exists in retail. Companies who listen to their customer feedback, utilize comfortable and durable materials during production and deliver a consistent product often develop a cult following among women. Brand familiarity goes a long way when online shopping. If you know the fit, quality, and style of particular clothing brands, there is a good chance they will offer consistency across their entire product line.</p>
      <h3>Choose Forgiving Fabrics and Styles</h3>
      <p>Many women prefer to shop for things like jeans, swimsuits, shoes, and suits at brick-and-mortar stores since these items tend to offer fit-related challenges. Sweaters, basic knits, pull-on pants, and popover dresses, however, are great styles to shop for over the internet. As a result, finding <a href="https://www.perfectlypriscilla.com/">clothes for curvy women</a> and other body types is often easier online. Garments with added stretch, cashmere-blend sweaters, and basic cotton tops are good pieces to purchase when shopping at online clothing stores. These styles generally offer consistency in terms of sizing and comfort from brand to brand. Shift dresses and many tunics have a boxy silhouette that will complement women of many shapes and sizes. These items can be belted or worn layered over or under other pieces for more styling options and to create a customized fit.</p>
      <p>Body-hugging styles, like sheath dresses and skinny jeans, may offer less forgiveness when it comes to fit. Additionally, fabrics like rayon, linen, acetate, and polyester do not afford any stretch; this may pose fit issues if these fabrics are not blended with stretch.</p>
      <h3>Pay Close Attention to Size Charts</h3>
      <p>Every clothing brand will have a posted size chart on their website. It is very important to study this chart and compare the posted measurements to your own. Most size charts will include bust, waist and hip measurements as it correlates to each of their respective sizes. Some manufacturers will also include thigh, arm and lower waist measurements for added accuracy. Many department stores, home shopping networks and larger retailers will sometimes post a size chart for each individual item in their inventory as opposed to just a general size chart. Adding a size chart for individual items greatly reduces the number of returns a company receives, and it helps customers choose items with more accuracy and confidence.</p>
      <p>In addition to helping us feel more confident, better fitting clothes also help us feel more comfortable. Attire which leaves us feeling exposed or stifled can increase our stress and anxiety. We’re often unable to do our best when wearing clothes that make us feel uncomfortable.</p>
      <p>Of course, clothing that fits is just one aspect of achieving a positive attitude and subsequently improving your health and wellness. It will always be important to eat right, sleep well, and exercise regularly. What’s more, a good state of mental health is essential. </p>
      <p>But making sure your clothes fit is a good place to start!</p>
