      <p><i>17,800-km London-Sydney journey aimed at assessing effects of ultra long-haul flights<br/></i><br/>#Perth <br/><br/>Australia's national carrier Qantas on Friday successfully completed a 19-and-a-half hour non-stop flight from London to Sydney, which was used to run a series of tests to assess the effects of ultra long-haul flights on crew fatigue and passenger jetlag. <br/><br/>The Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner took off from London'30pm on Friday. <br/><br/>The 17,800-km journey was part of Project Sunrise - Qantas' goal to operate regular, non-stop commercial flights from Australia's east coast cities of Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne to London and New York. <br/><br/>Last month, Qantas completed the first non-stop flight from New York to Sydney, which took 19 hours and 16 minutes. Another New York to Sydney flight is expected next month to round out the project. <br/><br/>There were 52 people - mostly Qantas employees - on board. They participated in various experiments, including using wearable technology devices to track sleep patterns, food and drink intake, lighting and physical movement. <br/><br/>A final decision on whether the ultra-long haul flights will become a commercial reality is expected by the year's end, with the service potentially launching by 2022. <br/><br/>It was the second time a commercial airline has flown the route. The first was in 1989, with a journey time of 20 hours and 9 minutes. AP</p>
