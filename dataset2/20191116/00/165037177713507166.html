        <b>Phil Foden keeps knocking at the England 1st teams' door day after day because of his goals. The latest goal he scored was with England u21s. A left-footed free-kick... without a doubt, a goal of a star.</b>
      </p>
      <p>20 minutes in and the score at 0-0, <b>Foden</b> decided to change that.</p>
      <p>The referee blew for a <b>very dangerous foul</b> close to Albania's box. England U21 decided that Foden was <b>the perfect man to take it</b>. They weren't mistaken.</p>

      <p>Foden <b>shot with his left foot</b>, and<b> the effect, the power</b>... everything was perfect.</p>
      <p>The Albania goalkeeper got down well but couldn't do anything to avoid the<b> tremendous missile </b>from Foden. A precious goal with the City player reaffirming: "Southgate, here I am", he seemed to shout.</p>
