      <p>Agent Andre Kutyan believed this five-bedroom house on a 52-foot-by-115-foot lot could fetch $2.2-million to $2.3-million this summer. At the seller’s request, it was listed for $2.495-million, but without any offers over two months, as buyers had their pick of infill homes nearby. It was relisted at $2,349,000 after Canada Day.</p>
      <p>“When you go just north of the 401 [highway] and west of Yonge Street, you’re getting a lot of value. For what you’d pay for [a house on] a 25-foot lot at Yonge and Lawrence – but for 10 per cent less – you’re getting a 50-footer,” Mr. Kutyan said.</p>
      <p>An offer came in, but, despite days of negotiations, the seller ultimately rejected it. Days later, the interested party returned.</p>
      <p>“The buyers discovered they wouldn’t have another home to buy in the area for this kind of money and came back with an improved offer,” Mr. Kuytan said.</p>
      <h3>What they got</h3>

      <p>More than a year ago, this two-storey house was built with 3,465 square feet of living space and interior access to a double garage. The 1,492-square-foot finished basement provides another bedroom, a workout area and a lounge with an exit to the south-facing backyard.</p>
      <p>Similar to the exterior treatment, large panes of glass and stone are showcased in the interior such as in the eat-in kitchen. Hardwood floors and pot lights extend into the central dining area and two entertaining spaces.</p>
      <h3>The agent’s take</h3>

      <p>“Most of the homes [in the neighbourhood], even if they’re new homes, are fairly traditional or transitional in look, whereas this was ultramodern and open concept,” Mr. Kutyan said.</p>
      <p>“It has a high-end kitchen done by Cameo Kitchens, which is a premium kitchen company I see in four-, five- and six-million-dollar homes.”</p>
