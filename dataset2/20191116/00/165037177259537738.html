        <b>Neil Harris has replaced Neil Warnock as manager of Championship club Cardiff City.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/cardiff-city-fc/">Cardiff City</a> have appointed<b> former Millwall boss Neil Harris </b>as the club's new manager on a <b>two-and-a-half-year contract</b> following the <b>departure of Neil Warnock.</b></p>
      <p>Harris takes over with the Bluebirds <b>14th in the Championship </b>after <b>winning just one of their past six matches</b> â€“ a run that culminated in<b> Warnock leaving the club by mutual consent.</b></p>
      <p>During <b>a four-year spell in charge of Millwall, </b>Harris helped the club to <b>promotion from League One</b> via the play-offs in 2016-17, but he resigned on October 3 following<b> a run of seven winless matches.</b></p>
      <p>Cardiff said in a statement on Saturday: "Cardiff City FC can confirm the appointment of Neil Harris as<b> the club's first-team manager".</b></p>
