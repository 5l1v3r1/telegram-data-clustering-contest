      <p>In this Instagram age, pictures aren't just worth a thousand words; they can be worth a pretty penny, too, which makes graphic designers a highly sought-after profession.</p>
      <p>But being a graphic artist takes more than just the ability to draw a picture, and certainly more than the ability to navigate through Photoshop. <a href="https://store.boingboing.net/sales/the-school-of-graphic-design-mastery-bundle?utm_source=boingboing.net&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=the-school-of-graphic-design-mastery-bundle&amp;utm_term=scsf-346650&amp;utm_content=a0x1P000004MrkH&amp;scsonar=1">The School of Graphic Design Mastery Bundle</a> is one of the few online courses that gives you comprehensive training on all the aspects of design - not just a walkthrough for a piece of image editing software.</p>

These teach you how to use essential programs like Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign, while also giving you hands-on knowledge of color theory and composition.</p>
      <p>Once you've got a handle on the core concepts, you'll get a broader view of what it takes to create big brands: Creating standards across all media, developing a color palette and the like. There are also dedicated courses in logo design using Adobe Illustrator and expert-level photo manipulation with Photoshop.</p>
      <p>The entire package gives you 40 hours of lectures and exercises, and you can get lifetime access to it for a full <a href="https://store.boingboing.net/sales/the-school-of-graphic-design-mastery-bundle?utm_source=boingboing.net&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=the-school-of-graphic-design-mastery-bundle&amp;utm_term=scsf-346650&amp;utm_content=a0x1P000004MrkH&amp;scsonar=1">97% off the cost</a> of the individual classes.</p>
