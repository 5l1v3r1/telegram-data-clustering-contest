        <b>Ivan Rakitic is not on Atletico Madrid's agenda. That is at least what 'Mundo Deportivo' says. According to this source, 'Los Colchoneros' have not thought about making any offer to Barca for the Croat.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Catalan paper makes one thing clear: <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/i-rakitic-2139">Rakitic</a> <b>is not going to end up at the Wanda Metropolitano</b>. At least not at the moment. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/atletico-madrid/">Atletico</a> will not make any attempt to sign Rakitic. The thing is not that they do not like the footballer<b>, the problem is that they cannot sign him</b>. </p>
      <p><b>La Liga's salary cap would apparently prevent Atletico</b> from signing anyone in January. </p>

      <p>Therefore, <b>Atletico have apparently ruled out the arrival of reinforcements</b> for the winter transfer window. No new faces are expected at the Metropolitano. </p>

      <p>In addition, 'Mundo Deportivo' says that <b>it is not Atletico's priority to sign midfielders.</b> They have already got Thomas, Herrera, Koke, Saul and Llorente. <b>They have that area of the field well covered. </b></p>
      <p>In recent days, there was talk of Atletico putting in an offer for Barcelona's Rakitic. 'Vamos' said that <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/new/atletico-could-bid-40-million-euros-for-rakitic-745151">the team from Madrid were willing to put in 40 million euros</a>. However,<b> the Catalan press strongly deny that </b><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/barcelona">Barcelona</a> will be sent this offer. </p>
