      <p>The number one tip to lose weight is keeping track of everything you eat. If your diet consists of unhealthy food, then you need to replace that with organic food. Also, have a journal of everything you eat. For you to lose weight, you need to burn more calories than what you consume. And if you’re consuming more calories than what you burn, you will add more weight. It’s that simple.</p>
      <p>3.      <b>Exercise more often</b></p>

      <p>You might lose weight by following the first two tips here, but if you want a lean and attractive body, you need to hit the gym. Exercise is the fastest way to lose weight because of increased metabolism rate. However, those who wish to reduce their scale numbers usually avoid the gym for reasons only known to them. What such people fail to understand is that the gym is a quick way to getting a toned body and a six-pack- which is envied by many.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Bottom Line</b>
      </p>
      <p>So there you have your three secrets to losing weight. If you follow these cues correctly, you’re going to get the desired results. But one thing you need to keep in mind is to always stay focused. Don’t be swayed away by unhealthy food choices, which may jeopardize your goal. Instead, eat clean food at all times, drink plenty of water, and exercise regularly for optimum results.</p>
