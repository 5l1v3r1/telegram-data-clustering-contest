      <p>Former United Nations (UN) Secretary-General, Ban Ki-Moon, says Ghana is making great economic strides under the leadership of President Akufo-Addo.</p>
      <p>The celebrated diplomat made the assertion at the Jubilee House when he paid a courtesy call on President Akufo-Addo ahead of his participation in the prestigious Africa Netpreneur Prize Initiative, a Jack Ma’s flagship entrepreneur program in Africa led by the Jack Ma Foundation.</p>
      <p>“Under your leadership, your country is making great strides in economic development. I understand that IMF has predicted that you will have almost 7% annual growth and this is highly commendable,” the former UN chief said. “Many European countries including Korea are growing just about 2 to 3 per cent. I hope you will make great strides in economic and social development,” Mr Moon added.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Paying Respect to Kofi Annan</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mr Moon further stated that as part of his schedule, he will be visiting the graveside of the late UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, to pay his respects to the Ghanaian global icon.</p>
      <p>
        <b>President Akufo-Addo</b>
      </p>
      <p>President Akufo-Addo in his brief remarks praised the former UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-Moon, for spearheading the development of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The President further recalled how he led the global campaign that led to Mr Moon being elected as the Secretary-General of the world body.</p>
      <p>“We met when you were Foreign Minister of Korea and I was then Foreign Minister of Ghana. We struck up a good relationship and that is what led me to be almost your campaign manager. I never regretted because your performance as Secretary-General was something that vindicated all of us who believed in you,” President Akufo Addo indicated.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Man Ban Ki-Moon</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ban Ki-Moon was the eighth Secretary-General of the United Nations. His priorities had been to mobilize world leaders around a set of new global challenges, from climate change and economic upheaval to pandemics and increasing pressures involving food, energy and water.</p>
      <p>He sought to be a bridge-builder, to give voice to the world’s poorest and most vulnerable people, and to strengthen the Organization itself. Mr Ban held office from on January 1, 2007 to December 31 2016. On 21st June 2011, he was unanimously re-elected by the General Assembly for a second mandate.</p>
      <p>One of the Secretary-General’s first major initiatives was the 2007 Climate Change Summit, followed by extensive diplomatic efforts that have helped put the issue at the forefront of the global agenda.</p>
      <p>Subsequent efforts to focus on the world’s main anti-poverty targets, the Millennium Development Goals, have generated more than $60 billion in pledges, with a special emphasis on Africa and the new Global Strategy on Women’s and Children’s Health.</p>
      <p>At the height of the food, energy and economic crises in 2008, the Secretary-General successfully appealed to the G20 for a $1 trillion financing package for developing countries and took other steps to guide the international response and protect the vulnerable and poor.</p>
