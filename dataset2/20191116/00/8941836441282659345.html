      <h1>Microsoft hires ex-AG Holder to audit face-scanning firm</h1>

      <p>Microsoft is hiring former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to review its investment in a facial recognition startup that scans faces at <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/israel-defense-forces/">Israeli military</a> checkpoints.</p>
      <p>Microsoft said in a statement Friday that Holder will lead a team of former federal prosecutors conducting an audit.</p>
      <p>Its aim is to determine whether Israeli firm AnyVision’s technology applications comply with Microsoft’s ethical principles against using facial recognition for mass surveillance.</p>
