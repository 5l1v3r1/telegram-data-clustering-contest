        <b>Ghana captain Andre Ayew has called on the Police to forgive Awal Sulaiman, the man who invaded the pitch during the Black Stars 2-0 win over South Africa at the Cape Coast Stadium on Thursday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sulaiman, a 25-year old nursing graduate is currently in the custody of Cape Coast Police and is set to be arraigned before court on Monday.</p>
      <p>Several Ghanaians have taken to social media to plead on behalf of the pitch invader but the Police are yet to soften their stance on the matter.</p>
      <p>According to media reports, attempt by the Sulaiman's family to get him out of the grips of the Police have proven futile.</p>
      <p>And the Swansea City forward has joined the masses in urging the Police to tamper justice with mercy by releasing Sulaiman.</p>
