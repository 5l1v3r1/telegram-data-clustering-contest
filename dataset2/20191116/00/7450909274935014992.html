The Polish fighter is looking to make it two in a row as he is coming off of a knockout win over <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Luke-Rockhold-23345">Luke Rockhold</a>. "Jacare" is set to make his 205-pound debut, after alternating wins and losses at middleweight in his last six. The co-main attraction pairs <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Mauricio-Rua-5707">Mauricio Rua</a> (206) against short notice opponent <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Paul-Craig-110167">Paul Craig</a> (205) also at light heavyweight.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.sherdog.com/events/UFC-Fight-Night-164-Blachowicz-vs-Jacare-76601">UFC Fight Night 164</a> airs live on ESPN+ on Saturday, Nov. 16 at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT, and also features a lightweight showdown between submission specialist <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Charles-Oliveira-30300">Charles Oliveira</a> (155) and <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Jared-Gordon-74057">Jared Gordon</a> (156). At middleweight, a pair of two-time <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/organizations/Dana-Whites-Contender-Series-12411">Dana White's Contender Series</a> alums in <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Antonio-Arroyo-173979">Antonio Arroyo</a> (185) and <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Andre-Muniz-81800">Andre Muniz</a> (186) make their UFC debuts opposite one another. Opening up the main card is former <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/organizations/Legacy-Fighting-Alliance-11339">Legacy Fighting Alliance</a> 185-pound king <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Markus-Perez-131219">Markus Perez</a> (186) locking horns with <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Wellington-Turman-157451">Wellington Turman</a> (186) at middleweight.<br/><br/>Also of note, <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Ariane-Lipski-147487">Ariane Lipski</a> (125.5) is set for her third opponent as mere hours before weigh-ins, <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Veronica-Macedo-180217">Veronica Macedo</a> had to withdraw <a href="https://lasueur.com/veronica-macedo-ufc-sao-paulo-15-11-2019">reportedly</a> due to "violent headaches." Stepping in is <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Isabela-de-Padua-183333">Isabela de Padua</a> (130.5)*, who was one of three fighters to miss weight. The promotion is still considering whether it will proceed as a catchweight and what the fine amount will be, if any. Additionally, <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Tracy-Cortez-160955">Tracy Cortez</a> (136.5) and <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Vanessa-Melo-120777">Vanessa Melo</a> (136.5)** both missed the bantamweight limit by .5 pounds, and neither woman will be fined.<br/><br/>The Brazilian Athletic Commission of MMA (CABMMA) has since <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2019/11/tracy-cortez-vanessa-melo-make-weight-ufc-on-espn-plus-22-sao-paulo-commission-error">released a statement</a>, claiming that the backstage scale was improperly calibrated, which led to Cortez and Melo missing weight. CABMMA stated that the scale provided to the fighters was .7 pounds higher than the official scale, so the two women stopped cutting weight under the assumption that they were on target. They both went on to weigh 136.5 pounds, but due to this error, the weights have been corrected to 136 pounds each and neither will be fined.</p>
