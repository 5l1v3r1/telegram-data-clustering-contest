      <h4>Kiez Döner in Halle has reopened for the first time after a 20-year-old man was shot in the fast-food outlet during a far-right terror attack. The two brothers who were working at the time have taken on ownership.</h4>
      <p>The owner of a kebab shop targeted during <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germany-thousands-attend-concert-honoring-victims-of-halle-shooting/a-50900841">an anti-Semitic terror attack in Halle</a> has handed over the fast-food outlet to two staff members who were there at the time. They opened its doors on Saturday for the first time since the deadly incident.</p>
      <p>Izzet Cagac passed on ownership of the "Kiez Döner" store in Halle, eastern Germany, to the brothers Ismet and Rafin Tekin, various German media outlets reported.</p>
      <p>"I wish my successors much energy to be able to come to terms with the terrible event on October 9 and hope there are many customers of different cultures and religions," wrote Cagac in a letter published on the German news portal Zeit online<i> </i>and in <i>Der Spiegel </i>magazine.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Reiner Haseloff, the premier of the state of Saxony-Anhalt, also attended the fast-food outlet's reopening, emphasizing the importance of a new beginning.</p>
      <p>Haseloff was also the store's first customer at 10 a.m. local time (0900 UTC), eating a kebab with former owner Cagac to fulfil a promise he made following the shooting.</p>

      <p>Cagac stated his intention to pass on the kebab store in October in the regional <i>Mitteldeutsche Zeitung, </i>but the report noted that at the time it was not known if the two brothers wanted to take on the store.</p>

        <b>Random killings after failing to gain entry to Halle synagogue</b>
      </p>
      <p>Five weeks ago a heavily armed 27-year-old man, named only as Stephan B. under German privacy laws, attempted to gain access to a synagogue in Halle on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar.</p>
      <p>On failing to get into the building, the man killed two people at random — a 40-year-old woman who was walking past and a 20-year-old in the kebab shop — before being arrested.</p>
