We wanted to create space that will be his comfort and allow him to rest, said Kuziva.<br/>“We thought that the earthy tone, greens, mustard and the blues would complement the nature that is around us.”<br/>Anyone who is a die-hard rugby follower, would love to walk through the Beast”s  accolade room – with medals, signed T-shirts and caps to make any rugby follow green with envy.<br/><b>WATCH: </b></p>
