      <p>JEFFERSONVILLE, Ind. (AP) - Ten inmates at a southern Indiana jail are charged in an alleged scheme that authorities say used codes to help smuggle drugs into the jail.</p>
      <p>The Clark County Sheriff’s Office says the inmates worked with an outside contact who picked up drugs and hid them in the jail’s lobby, which inmates cleaned.</p>
      <p>Col. Scotty Maples says code words were used in a computer system inmates can access to signal where the drugs would be dropped off in the lobby.</p>
