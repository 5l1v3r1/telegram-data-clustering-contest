      <h1>CBS News Claims More Mass Shootings than Days This Year</h1>
      <h2>In the wake of the November 14, Santa Clarita, California, school attack CBS News claimed there have been more mass shootings than days to this point in 2019.</h2>

      <p>CBS News <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mass-shootings-2019-more-mass-shootings-than-days-so-far-this-year/?ftag=CNM-00-10aab7e&amp;linkId=77118735">points</a> to figures from the Gun Violence Archive (GVA) suggesting there have been 366 mass shootings during the first 319 days of 2019.</p>
      <p>Ironically, GVA has long reported higher numbers of mass shootings than other outlets because they define mass shootings differently. Whereas the FBI defines a mass shooting as four or more <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43004.pdf">killed</a> in one incident, not counting the attacker. The GVA considers an incident a “mass shooting” even if there are no deaths. The GVA definition is broadened to <a href="https://twitter.com/GunDeaths/status/1033826854057046016">include</a> “FOUR or more shot and/or killed in a single event [incident],” not counting the attacker.</p>
      <p>Because of this, their count of incidents contains FBI-verified mass shootings, such as Virginia Beach (May 31, 2019), El Paso (August 3, 2019), Dayton, Ohio (August 4, 2019), Odessa / Midland (August 31, 2019), but <a href="https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/reports/mass-shooting">also counts</a> a November 11, 2019 shooting in Florida where there were no casualties. They count a November 10, 2019, shooting in Kansas City, a shooting that same day in Little Rock, Arkansas, and a November 9, 2019, shooting in Vidalia, Georgia, none of which had casualties.</p>
      <p>In fact, approximately 173 of GVA’s 366 “mass shootings” had zero fatalities, and this is to say nothing about the untold number of incidents with one casualty that they counted as a “mass shooting” as well.</p>
