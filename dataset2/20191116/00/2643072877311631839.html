      <h3>Is It A Taboo For A Man To Kneel Down And Propose To A Woman?</h3>
      <p>Veteran Nollywood actor,<a href="http://www.naijanews.com/topic/pete-edochie/"><u><b> Pete Edochie</b></u></a> has berated Nigerian men who go on their knees to ask their lover’s hand in marriage.</p>
      <p>According to the legendary Actor, frowned at the level by which Africans especially young people of today are adopting the ways and policies of the Europeans, thereby rubbishing our tradition and culture. Kneeling to propose to a woman is white people’s culture because women dominate there and have more rights than men, it is not the African man’s ways.</p>
      <p>The actor whitewashed African men who kneel down to propose to their would-be wives all in the name of love. He said by so doing, you’re giving the woman power over you, thereby making her the head of the marriage. He went on to remind us that, in the traditional way of things, it is a woman who kneels to give drink to a man to show her loyalty, humility and total submission to the man and that’s the way it should be.</p>
      <p>In his words, …<i> “I didn’t kneel to propose to my wife and we’ve stayed 50years in our marriage, I took my time to woo her, when it’s time to settle down, I asked if she’ll marry me and that was it. He went on to give account of how the Whites came to Africa pretending to be archeologists but little did we know they came to destroy our culture and trade us”.</i></p>
