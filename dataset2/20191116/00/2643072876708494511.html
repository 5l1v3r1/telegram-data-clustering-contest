      <p>The <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/15/just-in-inec-decides-on-apc-contesting-bayelsa-govship-election/"><u><b>All Progressives Congress (APC)</b></u></a> has accused leaders of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) of plotting to frustrate collation of results in Bayelsa State.</p>
      <p>The APC made the accusation in a statement on Saturday by the Vice-Chairman, Media, APC Campaign Council, Julius Bokoru.</p>
      <p>Bokoru, in his statement, alerted security agencies especially the military and the police of an alleged plot by <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/16/finally-bayelsa-pdp-governorship-candidate-votes/"><u><b>the PDP</b></u></a> to unleash violence to subvert the will of the people in Bayelsa.</p>
      <p>He said the PDP plan to attack APC strongholds and attack collation officers to stop the results from getting to the collation centres.</p>
      <p>According to Bokoru, <i>“We are monitoring what they are doing and we will continue to expose the evil plot of the PDP against the electoral process.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“We have most of the unit results and the people of Bayelsa have spoken and their wish must be respected.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“We are calling on security agencies to be vigilant and stay at alert so as not to be ambushed by unscrupulous and criminal elements hired by the PDP.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“We specifically called on them to pay attention to areas Governor Seriake Dickson has been complaining about.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“We can’t help the governor’s frustration because he is aware before now that the people of Bayelsa are willing and ever determined to end the misgovernance of this state.”</i>
