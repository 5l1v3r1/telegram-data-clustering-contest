      <p>The National Commission for Civic Education ( NCCE) in the Jasikan district has held a forum to educate stakeholders on social auditing.</p>
      <p>The forum was held on Tuesday, 12th November 2019 at Atonkor, a farming community in the aforementioned district of Oti region.</p>
      <p>It brought together community members, chiefs and other stakeholders to discuss the community's involvement and role in seeing to the continuation and completion of a market project which has been adopted by the community under the social audit initiative, and how they could support the government through the District Assembly.</p>
      <p>The chairperson of the National Commission for Civic Education, Josephine Nkrumah who is on a working visit to some selected districts in the region, said the social audit program provides an avenue for local people to own developmental projects, and actively contribute their quota to the social growth of their communities.</p>
      <p>“The last time I visited you, you all agreed and confirmed that a market was the most pressing need that will benefit the community. I know work has stalled a little on the project because of the unfavourable weather conditions, but I want us to remain committed to effectively work to see to the completion of the market”, she said.</p>
      <p>Madam Nkrumah noted that “the progress of Atonkor relies greatly on you and me. we can't rely on the government for everything we need. That is why this social audit program was initiated to make local people own their development by using their wisdom, might and resources to build the development they want to see for themselves”.</p>
      <p>The NCCE chairperson who wasn't enthused about women's participation in the country's development encouraged the women of Atonkor to use this social audit program to challenge themselves as worthy contributors to development in their community.</p>
      <p>“Women are the majority in the country and the situation is the same even at this forum right now, but this doesn't translate into the participation of women in development. Women are created with inner abilities that allow us to do great things if we decide to do them. Isn't it true?”, she quizzed.</p>
      <p>The Queen mother of Atonkor, Nana Agyedubea I on behalf of the community pledged their commitment to relentlessly work to make the market project a success.</p>
      <p>
        <b>DISTRICT LEVEL ELECTIONS AND REFERENDUM</b>
      </p>
      <p>Addressing the forum on the upcoming district level elections and referendum, Madam Nkrumah encouraged residents to participate actively in this year's district-level elections since this gives them an opportunity to decide who is given the mandate to represent electoral areas at the Municipal and District Assembly level of decision making.</p>
      <p>"How many times has a sitting President in this country visited you here at Atonkor after you have voted for him? It is the Assembly members that are closer to us, and that gives us the leisure of space to speak to them regarding issues affecting us directly", she said.</p>
      <p>The chairperson added that "During general elections, we see how agitated and eager we all become in wanting to elect our Presidents and Parliamentarians but that enthusiasm is not seen during district-level elections. This time round, we must endeavour to participate fully in both district level elections and the referendum".</p>
      <p>Madam Nkrumah took time to encourage all women to also involve themselves as either Assembly members or Unit committee members to help bridge the huge gap the exits between men and women at various Assemblies.</p>
      <p>Out of the 42 out gone Assembly members at the Jasikan district Assembly, only one was a woman.</p>
      <p>The forum brought together national chair of NCCE, Josephine Nkrumah, Jasikan District NCCE Director, Stephen Mensah, staff of the district NCCE office, Chief of Atonkor, Nana Agyedu Asiedu IV, the Queen mother, Nana Agyedubea I, opinion leaders and community members.</p>
