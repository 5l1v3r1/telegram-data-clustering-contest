      <p>GADSDEN, Ala. (AP) - A mobile clinic is coming to Alabama but organizers say volunteers are desperately needed to help.</p>
      <p>The Remote Area Medical clinic is set for March 27-29 at Gadsden City High School, The Gadsden Times reported. It’s expected to provide medical, dental and vision services to 1,000 or more patients who otherwise might not have access to such services.</p>
      <p>Facilitating that will take 400 or more volunteers - roughly 150 medical and 250 support personnel - so organizers are sending out an SOS to churches.</p>

      <p>A meeting is planned at 5:15 p.m. Monday in Gadsden State Community College’s Beck Conference Room for representatives of churches interested in participating.</p>
      <p>The opportunities to serve are numerous and varied, including people to guide patients into the building, front-desk workers to register patients and people to assemble gift bags.</p>

      <p>Some churches already have volunteered to furnish meals for the weekend, but organizers say opportunities to donate or prepare one of the projected seven meals remain. Basic items like paper products or bottled water or other beverages also are needed. The clinic’s hardware and equipment also will have to be set up. Tractor-trailers will roll in before daylight March 27, so muscle and elbow grease are needed.</p>
      <p>“If you’re looking for mission opportunities, this makes it really easy to serve others,” said Ann Inzer, a member of the clinic’s hospitality committee.</p>
      <p>The clinic starts at 6 a.m. each day.</p>
      <p>RAM is based in Rockford, Tennessee. It’s a nonprofit group and was founded in 1985 by Stan Brock, a British philanthropist. It sets up mobile clinics akin to disaster command posts that can provide dental cleanings, fillings, x-rays and extractions; eye exams with prescription eyeglasses made onsite and gynecological and general medical exams, all free of charge.</p>
