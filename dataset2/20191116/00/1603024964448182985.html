      <p>"On the weekly scale, Nifty has formed Doji candle for continuous two weeks, thus indicating that bulls and bears both are making their share of attempts to drag the index on either side. However, the short term trend for Nifty continues to be range-bound with a slight negative bias," Nilesh Jain, Derivative and Technical Analyst at AnandRathi said.</p>
      <p>We expect a soft start on November 18 with some range-bound trade. As long as it trades below 12,050 levels we expect some consolidation in the range of 11,800-12,000 zone," Jain added.</p>
