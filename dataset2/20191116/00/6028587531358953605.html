      <h4>The Draw</h4>
      <p>The rematch of what is arguably the most intense and entertaining bare-knuckle fight in recent memory is slotted for the main event. Knight gets another crack at Lobov in hopes of evening the score after dropping a unanimous decision back in April.</p>
      <p>Both men had mildly successful runs with the UFC and Lobov’s fame grew because of his association with Conor McGregor. He has positioned himself as arguably the top-rated bare-knuckle fighter in the world. His victories over Knight and then former boxing world champion Paulie Malignaggi has Lobov sitting pretty high on most lists.</p>
      <p>Can he make it two in a row over Knight? That’s what fans will be watching for on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The co-main event figures to be a slugfest that could end abruptly. Heavyweight powerhouse Chase Sherman defends his BKFC Heavyweight title against the rugged Joey Beltran. Sherman has seemingly found his niche with bare-knuckle fighting. He’s won a title and established himself as one of the toughest outs in the promotion. Beltran has been around the combat sports landscape for a long time. He wants to prove he’s ready to reach new heights with his latest fight promotion.</p>
      <p>Here is a look at the entire card.</p>

      <h4>PPV Outlook</h4>
      <p>BKFC President Dave Feldman said the first meeting between the two men did nearly <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2019/07/david-feldman-bare-knuckle-fc-6-trending-toward-200000-ppv-buys">200,000 pay-per-view buys</a>, though some industry experts <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/7/5/20682610/malignaggi-vs-lobov-estimated-at-18000-television-ppv-buys?_ga=2.53442792.197611357.1573888418-598610001.1486276185">doubted the validity of that estimate</a>.</p>
      <p>This weekend’s event won’t be going head-to-head with a huge UFC card, though there is an event set for Sao Paulo, Brazil featuring Jacare Souza’s light heavyweight debut against Jan Blachowicz as well as a fight between Mauricio “Shogun” Rua and Paul Craig. We’ll have to wait to see what numbers are reported this time around.</p>
