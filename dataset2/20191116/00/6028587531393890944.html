      <p>This year’s Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL not only played the role of affordable alternatives to Google’s flagship smartphones, but they also rectified some of the glaring problems in the more expensive devices, too. I don’t know if that was intentionally Google’s plan, but it worked in making the 3a an arguably better value phone than the Pixel 3. </p>
      <p>The biggest issue for the Pixel 3 and 3XL was the memory management issue. It was comically slow and, ultimately, became unusable. That wasn’t the case for the less demanding 3a. This year’s Pixel 4 - despite being an excellent phone - suffers from poor battery life. </p>
      <p>Ater spending weeks tweaking settings and trying to find a combination that squeezes out another hour of lasting power, I’m ultimately resigned to the fact that the Pixel 4XL doesn’t compete with the likes of Samsung’s Note 10 or Apple’s iPhone 11 in battery life. </p>
      <p>It’s an odd thing for Google to fail on, too, because previous Pixel devices have had some of the best battery life I’ve used on a smartphone. Whatever combination of software and hardware Google conjured together in the Pixel 1 &amp; 2, it hasn’t managed to fully repeat it in subsequent handsets. </p>
      <p>But that doesn’t necessarily mean gameover for Google’s current range of smartphones. If you’re particularly keen on owning a Pixel, waiting for the Pixel 4a might be a smart move. Google solved the memory management issue in the 3a - perhaps because it listened to critics and owners - and it may well do for the same for the 4a. There’s also the fact that budget devices are less power hungry (typically because of a lower resolution display and a less demanding chipset) and last longer. </p>
      <p>The average battery life, which sees my Pixel 4XL needing a charge by 8pm, is the only thing holding the Pixel 4 back from being one of the best phones of the year. Elsewhere, in performance, camera and AI, it excels. Google has smartly baked in some core Google Assistant functionality, which makes it genuinely useful. Stuff like automatic transcription of videos (for when you can’t turn the sound on) and automatic transcription of voice notes mark the Pixel 4 out as a different type of smartphone.</p>
      <p>This is why the 4a is exciting. Google made its best technology available on the cheaper phone earlier this year - including Assistant and the excellent camera. If you're happy to sacrifice on display resolution and a less cutting edge design, then the budget 4a could be excellent value for money.  </p>
      <p>If Google does follow the same principle of porting over the same camera technology and Assistant functionality to the cheaper 4a model, then it has a chance at making amends. </p>
