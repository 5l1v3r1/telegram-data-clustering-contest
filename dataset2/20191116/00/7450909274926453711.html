      <p><a href="https://www.sherdog.com/organizations/Ultimate-Fighting-Championship-2">Ultimate Fighting Championship</a> light heavyweight king <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Jon-Jones-27944">Jon Jones</a> may have revealed he will be fighting <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Dominick-Reyes-145941">Dominick Reyes</a> next after a social media exchange.<br/><br/>"Bones" took to Twitter on Thursday to let fans know his upcoming fight would be announced in a few weeks' time.<br/><br/>To no surprise, it caught the attention of many who wanted to know his next opponent, with most replies guessing it would be either Reyes or <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Corey-Anderson-171723">Corey Anderson</a>. Instead of letting fans know immediately, Jones decided to drop some hints.</p>

      <p>The hint appeared to imply that his next opponent will be Reyes, as he claimed his opponent has something in common with <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Ryan-Bader-22858">Ryan Bader</a> and <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Daniel-Cormier-52311">Daniel Cormier</a>. Both men were undefeated when they took on "Bones," much like "The Devastator."<br/><br/>Many fans were hoping that the light heavyweight champion would move up to heavyweight and take a "super fight" against either Cormier or current heavyweight titleholder <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Stipe-Miocic-39537">Stipe Miocic</a>. Jones stated it was something he was considering, but he said he has enough money and is "after these contenders' hearts."</p>

      <p>When this fight will take place remains to be seen, but Jones made it clear it will happen in the coming weeks, which would seem to indicate late 2019 or early 2020.<br/><br/>Jones is currently riding a three-fight win streak, most recently edging out a split decision over <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Thiago-Santos-90021">Thiago Santos</a> at UFC 239. Before that, he beat <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Anthony-Smith-29470">Anthony Smith</a> by decision at UFC 235 to defend his belt. Jones first won his belt back at UFC 232 by knocking out former rival <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Alexander-Gustafsson-26162">Alexander Gustafsson</a>.<br/><br/>Reyes (12-0) is unbeaten at 6-0 inside the Octagon. In his last fight and his first UFC headliner, he knocked out former middleweight champ <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Chris-Weidman-42804">Chris Weidman</a> in the first round. He also holds notable wins over <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Volkan-Oezdemir-58503">Volkan Oezdemir</a>, <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Ovince-St-Preux-38842">Ovince St. Preux</a> and <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Jared-Cannonier-78628">Jared Cannonier</a>. The 29-year-old is currently ranked at No. 6 in Sherdog's <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/news/rankings/3/Sherdogs-Official-Mixed-Martial-Arts-Rankings-165533">light heavyweight rankings</a>, and Jones has defeated the men in the No. 2, 3 and 4 spots already.</p>
