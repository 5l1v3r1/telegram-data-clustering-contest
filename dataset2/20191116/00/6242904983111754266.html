        <b>Bafana Bafana head coach Molefi Ntseki says his team had a good game despite the defeat to the Black Stars of Ghana in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier.</b>
      </p>
      <p>South Africa lost 2-0 to Ghana at the Cape Coast Stadium on Thursday 14 November with goals from Atletico Madrid star Thomas Partey and Kudus Mohammed.</p>
      <p>According to Ntseki, the Black Stars were the better side but his team were not outplayed in the game.</p>
      <p>"I am still confident in my players even though we lost 2-0 and I feel the game was more balanced, he told reporters after the game.</p>
      <p>"They (Ghana) had more power and strength in getting the goals.</p>
      <p>"It was not like we were outplayed in the situation where we conceded.</p>
      <p>"It happens in the game of football - when you are not balanced the opponent will take advantage, he concluded.</p>
      <p>It was his Ntseki first competitive game in charge of the Bafana Bafana. South Africa will take on Sudan in the second game at the Orlando Stadium on Sunday 17 November.</p>
