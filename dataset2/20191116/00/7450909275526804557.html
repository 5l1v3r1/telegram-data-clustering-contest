However, Roddy said he would be excited for that fight as it would mean the bout would most likely stay standing.<br/><br/>“If it is ‘Cowboy,’ it would be an exciting fight,” Roddy said. “I said this a couple of months ago: ‘Cowboy’ and Conor is a great fight for the fans. Two guys that are exciting strikers; although ‘Cowboy’ is phenomenal on the ground, as well, but I think if it was a fight between them, it would be a striking battle, and I think it would be one for the fans, so if it is that, it’ll be an exciting one.”</p>
