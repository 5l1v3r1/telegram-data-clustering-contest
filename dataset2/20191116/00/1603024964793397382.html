      <p>In an open house held by the Telecom Regulation Authority of India (TRAI), Airtel and Vodafone were the only telecom operators opposed to ending Interconnect Usage Charge (IUC), News18 <a href="https://www.news18.com/news/india/trai-meet-favours-ending-iuc-charge-from-january-1-2388797.html">reported via IANS</a>.</p>
      <p>BSNL, MTNL and Jio were among the 155 participants who attended to discuss the January 1, 2020 date for the Bill and Keep (BAK) regime, which would replace the 6 paisa IUC, it quoted sources say.</p>
      <p>The January date was IUC was decided in a 2017 TRAI regulation paper, which was supported by the house SS Sirohi, former Member (Technology), Telecom Commission said.</p>

      </p>
      <p>He added, "After wide consultations, it was decided that the B&amp;K regime is the best regime for telecom and should be implemented at the earliest."</p>
      <p>Sirohi further said that removing IUC would maximise consumer welfare by making way for "adequate choice, affordable tariff and good quality and innovative services in a sustainable manner".</p>
      <p>IUC is the charge the operator of a network on which a call originates pays to the network <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/four-reasons-why-iuc-should-be-scrapped-in-trais-own-words-4518901.html">where the call terminates</a>.</p>
      <p>BAK, on the other hand, entails net IUC payment as zero. Here, each network agrees to terminate calls from the other network at no charge.</p>
      <p>For example, when a Jio subscriber makes a call (originator) to an Airtel subscriber (receiver) or vice versa, as per the agreement between Jio and Airtel, there will be nor charges either way.</p>
      <p>It thus effectively ensures that no TSP recover its costs of operations from competitors and, thereby, would enable greater competition in the sector.</p>
      <p>In 2017, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) notified that IUC would go by January 2020 only to retract on its stand by issuing a fresh consultation paper on the issue throwing the telecom sector into turmoil.</p>
      <p>It is puzzling that TRAI wants to revisit IUC when its 2017 explanatory memorandum clearly enunciated why this charge should go.</p>
