      <p>London - By agreeing <b>a goal based approach </b>to help cut emissions, the IMO has reached what the UK Chamber of Shipping, a national body representing over 140 companies, among the principle members of the International Chamber of Shipping, calls a “positive progress”.</p>
      <p>The IMO, writes the <b>UK Chamber of Shipping </b>in a press release, concluded that a mandatory goal-based approach is the most appropriate way forward that will provide the needed flexibility and incentive for innovation. <b>Two methods</b>, in line with the industry’s proposal, were recognised: a technical and an operational approach. It was agreed that the two approaches would be further refined, and their implementation and enforcement would also be developed at the next meeting.</p>
      <p>The next meeting, <b>due to take place 23-27 March in London </b>will also include discussions on some of the difficult questions on how we measure a ship’s efficiency accurately, establish a representative 2008 baseline and reflect the strategy’s targets to individual ships.</p>
      <p>“The progress made <b>sets the right direction of travel </b>and is a good foundation for the IMO’s work to put the strategy into action. However, there is still a lot to be done and we encourage all parties to show at the next meeting the same level of cooperation and come forward with constructive ideas to make sure that we deliver the ambitions of the IMO Green House Gas strategy,” said UK Chamber of Shipping Policy Director Anna Ziou.</p>
