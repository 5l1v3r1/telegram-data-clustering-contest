        <b>Salzburg striker Erling Haaland and Borussia Dortmund winger Jadon Sancho are in Manchester United's sights as January approaches.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Manchester United have hatched a plan that could help bring Erling Haaland to Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>The Premier League side are reportedly contemplating a compromise that will curry favour with Salzburg, the young star's present employers.</p>
      <p>Considered the favourites in that chase, United also appear set to jump the queue for another of Europe's most admired teenage talents.</p>
      <p>
        <b>TOP STORY – UNITED WILLING TO WAIT FOR HAALAND</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Manchester United</b> are prepared to consider loaning <b>Erling Haaland</b> straight back to Salzburg if a deal can be struck in January, such is their determination to land the sought-after striker.</p>
      <p>According to ESPN, United could allow Haaland to stay in Austria until the end of the season in an attempt to defuse a potential bidding war.</p>

        <b>ROUND-UP</b>
      </p>
      <p>- <b>United</b> are unlikely to stop at Haaland when the transfer window reopens. The club are weighing up whether to bring forward a planned end-of-season approach for <b>Jadon Sancho</b> in order to capitalise on uncertainty over the winger's Borussia Dortmund future, reports The Guardian.</p>
      <p>- <b>Juventus</b> are becoming concerned about the increasing level of interest from Spain and England in highly rated Brescia midfielder <b>Sandro Tonali</b>, according to Calciomercato. The Serie A champions could be forced to make a move sooner rather than later as his suitors gain in number and his price tag rises above €40m.</p>
      <p>- That sum, Calciomercato claims, is the minimum Juve will demand for out-of-favour defenders <b>Daniele Rugani </b>and <b>Merih Demiral</b>. Both players have been linked to<b> Arsenal</b>.</p>
      <p>- <b>Boca Juniors</b> are eyeing another showpiece signing. Argentina-based football journalist Martin Castilla told CNN Deportes the South American giants are keen on luring <b>Luis Suarez</b> away from Barcelona. <b>San Lorenzo</b> vice-president Marcelo Tinelli expressed interest in the 32-year-old earlier in the week.</p>
      <p>- Returning to Serie A and it looks like <b>Wojciech Szczesny</b> will be staying in Turin. Sky Sport Italia reporter Gianluca Di Marzio says the Polish goalkeeper has agreed a contract extension with Juve through to 2024.</p>
