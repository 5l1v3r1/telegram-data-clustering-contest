      <p>Nicolas Cage is in final negotiations with Lionsgate for a new movie project called “The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent”. The deal includes Tom Gormican (<i>That Awkward Moment</i>) as director, using a script he co-wrote Kevin Etten (<i>Scrubs</i>, <i>Desperate Housewives</i>). The film will be produced by Cage’s Saturn Films banner, with Mike Nilon and Kevin Turen. Cage is represented by WME.The film will see Cage play, essentially, a version of himself unsatisfied with life and in need of money. He accepts an offer from a Mexican billionaire fan for $1 million in exchange for a birthday appearance. He finds himself forced to become versions of his more famous characters to survive an increasingly dangerous situation.</p>

        <b>A Varied, Awesome Genre Career</b>
      </p>
      <p>Nicolas Cage has had a long and varied career, having won the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1995 for <i>Leaving Las Vegas</i>, nominated again for 2002’s <i>Adaptation</i>. In recent years Cage has starred in a variety of creative and well-regarded genre roles, capitalizing on his reputation for succeeding in over-the-top roles.</p>
      <p>In 2018, Cage starred in the critically well-received <i>Mom and Dad</i> (75%, RT), playing a parent in a time where a pandemic forces parents to obsessively want to kill their children. Also in 2018, Cage starred in <i>Mandy </i>(91%, RT), where he goes on a psychedelic bloody revenge mission against a terrible murderous cult (think ‘a Terminator mows down Hellraiser demons).</p>
      <p>Recently he starred as a black-and-white noir-ish version of Spider-Man from another dimension in the critically acclaimed, Oscar-winning <i>Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse</i>, and as the lead in the forthcoming psychedelic Lovecraft adaptation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_Out_of_Space_(film)"><i>Color Out of Space</i></a>.</p>
      <p>Another recent announced project, <i>Jiu Jutsu</i>, will see Cage in a martial arts science fiction indie film, playing a supporting character to the protagonist who must use Jiu Jutsu to best the leader of an invading alien force <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/03/nicolas-cage-alain-moussi-jiu-jitsu-movie-dimitri-logothetis-1202578728/">in martial combat</a>:</p>
      <p>“Every six years, an ancient order of expert Jiu Jitsu fighters faces a fearsome alien invader in a battle for Earth. When war hero and master Jiu Jitsu fighter Jake Barnes (Moussi) refuses to face Brax, the indomitable leader of the invaders, the future of humanity hangs in the balance. Injured and suffering from severe amnesia, Jake is captured by a military squad who have descended upon the planet and is rescued by Wylie (Cage) and a team of fellow Jiu Jitsu fighters who must help him recover his memory and regain his strength to engage in an epic battle that will once again determine the fate of mankind.”</p>
      <p>Cage playing a version of himself, having to take on a succession of parts in the midst of serious danger? Awesome. A sci-fi martial arts epic where Jiu Jutsu is the only hope against a nefarious space lord? Sign me up. A psychadelic Lovecraft adaptation? Literally my jam.</p>
      <p>It’s the Age of Cage, and if recent projects are any indication we have a lot to look forward to.</p>
