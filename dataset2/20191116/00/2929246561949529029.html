      <p>Asad Shafiq led another strong Pakistani batting performance in the second practice match on their tour of Australia on Friday, 15 November.</p>
      <p>Shafiq followed up his century from the first match with another hundred against Cricket Australia XI , finishing the first day of the two-day game at WACA, Perth, unbeaten on 101. </p>
      <p>Shan Masood (76), Babar Azam (63) and Kashif Bhatti (56*) brought up half-centuries, while Imam-ul-Haq was also among the runs. The Pakistanis finished the day on 386/7, having scored especially briskly in the last hour.</p>
      <p>Among the eight bowlers used from an inexperienced line-up for the hosts, leg-spinner Lloyd Pope was the standout, picking up five wickets. </p>

      <p>On a track expected to favour fast bowlers, Pakistan's pacers, who rolled over the opposition for 122 in the first game, are likely to again play a part on Saturday. </p>
      <p>"It's going to be a good contest," Azam told PCB in a chat, looking ahead to the two-Test series. "Our batsmen and bowlers are performing well. Our youngsters are in good form and have bowled well. Hopefully, we'll carry forward the performances into the Tests." </p>
      <p>The first Test begins on 21 November at the Gabba.</p>
