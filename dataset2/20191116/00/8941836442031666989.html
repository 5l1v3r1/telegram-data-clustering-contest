      <p>OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) - The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ottawa-senators/">Ottawa Senators</a> made up for a bad start with a solid ending.</p>
      <p>Filip Chlapik scored in the second period, Anders Nilsson made 26 saves and the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ottawa-senators/">Senators</a> killed off a late four-minute power play to beat the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/philadelphia-flyers/">Philadelphia Flyers</a> 2-1 Friday night.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ottawa/">Ottawa</a>’s Colin White took a double minor for high-sticking Claude Giroux with just over four minutes remaining in the game. The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/philadelphia-flyers/">Flyers</a> pulled Carter Hart for a two-man advantage, but were unable to get the equalizer.</p>

      <p>“That was maybe our worst start of the year on the first three shifts,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ottawa-senators/">Senators</a> coach D.J. Smith said. “We just weren’t ready or maybe they were ready, one of the two, but after that first five minutes I thought we were really competitive and played hard.”</p>
      <p>Tyler Ennis also scored for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ottawa-senators/">Senators</a> (8-10-1), who won back-to-back games for just the second time this season.</p>

      <p>Tyler Pitlick scored for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/philadelphia-flyers/">Flyers</a> (10-6-3), who lost in regulation for the first time since Oct. 29. Hart stopped 19 shots.</p>
      <p>“We should still find a way to win a game,” Philadelphia’s Jakub Voracek said. “I think we have a better team. Nothing against <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ottawa/">Ottawa</a>, they played a good game, but we have to find a way to win those games.”</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ottawa-senators/">Senators</a> got both of their goals in the second.</p>
      <p>Ennis tied it at 1 with a power-play goal 13:12 into the period. Ennis has three of the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ottawa-senators/">Senators</a>‘ five power-play goals this season.</p>

        <p>“Special teams and good goaltending got us the win,” Ennis said. “The power play has been struggling lately, but it was a factor in us winning and especially the penalty kill as well.”</p>
        <p>Chlapik made it 2-1 with 2:51 left. It was his second of the season.</p>
        <p>The fourth line of Chlapik, Chris Tierney and Bobby Ryan was solid for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ottawa-senators/">Senators</a>, creating a number of chances and drawing the penalty that led to Ennis’ goal.</p>
        <p>Pitlick gave Philadelphia the lead just two minutes into the game, beating Nilsson with a wrist shot.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/philadelphia-flyers/">Flyers</a> had a number of great chances in the first period, but Nilsson was solid. James Van Riemsdyk had two scoring chances on the same shift to open the game.</p>
        <p>The 29-year-old Nilsson was coming off an ugly 8-2 loss at Carolina on Monday night.</p>
        <p>“I think everyone knows right now what we, as a team, need to do to win hockey games,” he said. “We can’t out-skill the opponent. We have to beat every opponent every night on work ethic and we have to work extremely hard and we have to work harder than our opponents.”</p>
        <p>Philadelphia went 0 for 5 on the power play.</p>
        <p>“Our execution was a little bit off,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/philadelphia-flyers/">Flyers</a> coach Alain Vigneault said. “At the end the power play has the opportunity to tie us the game, had a lot of possession time in that four minutes, but no real good look that I would say.”</p>
        <p>NOTES: <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ottawa/">Ottawa</a> F Logan Brown returned to the lineup after missing the last six games with an upper-body injury.</p>
