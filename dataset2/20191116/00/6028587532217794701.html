      <p>The manic holiday shopping season is a couple of weeks away and, in typical fashion, the big retailers have given us an early look at what deals will be available.If you’re looking to pick up some Black Friday tech then keep an eye on my buying guides over the next couple of weeks as I round-up the best deals and explain what is - or isn’t - good value. </p>
      <p>Walmart has finally released its Black Friday ad and, if you’re after a smartphone, then there are good deals to be had. The retail store is continuing its “free” gift card offer, which far outstrip the size of the gift card you’ll get at <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2019/11/13/target-black-friday-2019-best-new-phone--tech-deals/#6f014f45537d">Target</a>. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Phones</b>
      </p>
      <p>Let’s start with the top-tier phones. Walmart, like previous years, is offering a gift card (to spend online only) for some phone purchases. There’s a <a href="https://www.walmart.com/browse/postpaid-annual-event-promotions/0/0/?_refineresult=true&amp;_be_shelf_id=7851490&amp;search_sort=100&amp;facet=shelf_id:7851490">$300 gift card</a> ($100 more than Target) that comes with every iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and 1Phone 11 Pro Max purchase (if you sign up to a contract). </p>
      <p>There’s an even bigger <a href="https://www.walmart.com/browse/postpaid-annual-event-promotions/0/0/?_refineresult=true&amp;_be_shelf_id=7851490&amp;search_sort=100&amp;facet=shelf_id:7851490">$450 gift card</a> for every Samsung S10, S10+ and Note 10+ purchase (with a contract). Or a <a href="https://www.walmart.com/browse/postpaid-annual-event-promotions/0/0/?_refineresult=true&amp;_be_shelf_id=7851490&amp;search_sort=100&amp;facet=shelf_id:7851490">$300 gift card</a> with the S10e and last year’s Note 9. </p>
      <p>The kicker is that Walmart is offering additional $250 gift card if you trade in your old device. It’s worth noting that the trade-in value of your old phone - if it’s damaged or not working - will affect the value of that extra gift card. $250 is the maximum value. This is comfortably better than Target’s offer and the best Black Friday gift card deal I’ve seen a while.</p>
      <p>For unlocked devices, you can pick up last year’s Samsung Galaxy S9 - unlocked - for $399 (<a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/seort/910201860">$200 off</a>).</p>
      <p>There’s no mention of Google Pixel devices - unlike <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2019/11/12/best-buy-black-friday-best-iphone-pixel--samsung-galaxy-deals/#446498a75ac3">Best Buy </a>and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2019/11/13/target-black-friday-2019-best-new-phone--tech-deals/#52a3e91537d0">Target</a>. There also isn’t any other top-tier Android phones discounted, which is fairly common among the big retailers. You may have to go directly to LG, Sony and other less popular device stores to find discounts. </p>
      <p>
        <b>What to spend that gift card on</b>
      </p>
      <p>If you do pick up one of those deals and manage to get the full $700 gift card deal, then there’s quite a few devices to buy. </p>
      <p>The deals that stand out to me are <a href="https://www.walmart.com/search/?query=fitbit%20versa%20lite">$99 FitBit Versa Lite</a>, the <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Oculus-Go-Standalone-Virtual-Reality-Headset-32GB-Oculus-VR/296029684">$149 Oculus Go</a> and the <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-38mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case/706203065">$129 Apple Watch Series 3</a>. There’s also <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-10-2-inch-iPad-7th-Gen-Wi-Fi-32GB/216119597">$70 off </a>the 7th gen iPad and <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/SAMSUNG-Galaxy-Tab-10-1-32GB-Android-P-Wifi-Black-SM-T510NZKWXAR/440177875">$70 off </a>Samsung’s Galaxy Tab A 10.1 inch. </p>
