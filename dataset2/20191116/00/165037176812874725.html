        <b>Real Betis will have to sell players to be able to sign people in January. It is getting closer until the window opens and the board will have to decide soon what the plan is if they want to make transfers.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The situation at the Benito Villamarin <b>is not how they thought it would be</b> at the beginning of the season. The team are fighting to avoid the relegation zone and initially, their plan was to finish in the top half. </p>
      <p>Some people are pointing the blame at the coach, but also at the players. An improvement of the squad may be carried out and they can do that in the January transfer window. <b>There are footballers in the market</b> and they might make some signings. </p>

      <p>However, according to 'Estadio Deportivo', the club will first have to sell people before buying players. <b>That way they will balance the books before signing new footballers.</b> That could be key in order to move out of trouble and up the table. </p>
      <p>The previously cited source says that <b>Sanabria</b>, on loan from Genoa, <b>is the main candidate to leave</b>. He joined Betis from Roma a while back and has still not managed to perform in Seville. </p>
