      <h1>MIUI 11 coming to the Redmi 4 after all</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T00:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/author.php3?idAuthor=28" target="_blank">George</a></address>
      <p>News <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/xiaomi_terminates_support_for_seven_redmi_phones-news-36404.php">came out in April</a> that Xiaomi will be discontinuing software support for a handful of aging devices, among them the <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/xiaomi_redmi_4_(4x)-8608.php">Redmi 4</a>. Apparently, the company's software team has reconsidered, as several forum users are reporting to have received a MIUI 11 update over the air.</p>

      <p>The release is named MIUI V11.0.2.0.NAMMIXM, and weighs in at 483MB. It leaves the phone in its previous Android 7.1.2 state - don't go hoping for a new OS version. The security patch level, meanwhile, is October 2018. Even so, it's still impressive that the two-and-a-half-year-old budget phone is getting the latest version of Xiaomi's proprietary Android overlay.</p>

      <p>One of the users to have gotten the update states that it's a preliminary test rollout with the complete rollout to all users to follow a week from now, so don't get too frustrated if you don't have it just yet.</p>
