      <p>Copenaghen - Shipping group A.P. Moller-Maersk said on Friday it expected <b>2020 growth</b> in global seaborne container traffic to be slightly higher than this year, although an ongoing trade war would limit the chances of a faster pick-up in traffic.</p>
      <p>Maersk, the <b>world’s biggest container shipper</b>, said it expected global container demand to grow by 1-3% in 2020 compared with 1-2% this year. “The continued weakening of global sentiment, above all in the manufacturing sector, reduces the likelihood of a growth pick-up in 2020,” the company said in a statement.</p>
