It is an 1876 novel, about a young boy growing up along the Mississippi River. It is set in the 1840s in the fictional town of St Petersburg, inspired by Hannibal, Missouri, where Twain lived as a boy. In the novel, Tom Sawyer has several adventures, often with his friend Huckleberry Finn. Originally a commercial failure, the book ended up being the bestselling of any of Twain’s works during his lifetime. Though overshadowed by its sequel, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, the book is considered a masterpiece of American literature, and was one of the first novels to be written on a typewriter. As for the author, he needs no introduction. But if you are just getting started into the world of literature, know this. Samuel Langhorne Clemens, known by his pen name Mark Twain, was an American writer, humorist, entrepreneur, publisher, and lecturer, and was lauded as ‘the father of American literature’. His wit and satire, in prose and in speech, earned praise from critics and peers, and he was a friend to presidents, artists, industrialists, and European royalty. <br/><br/>The event has been curated by Neeraj, who loves reading but can’t claim to be an avid reader.
