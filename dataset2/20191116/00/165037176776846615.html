        <b>Romelu Lukaku says he made the decision to leave Manchester United in March, five months before he joined Inter.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/r-lukaku-37669">Romelu Lukaku</a> claimed <b>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer wanted to keep him at </b><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a>, contradicting the Red Devils manager's claim he was happy to let the Belgian international join Inter in August.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer told Sky Sports that starting the season a striker short due to Lukaku's departure was "the decision that I made and I made it happily", but Lukaku said there was a time when the move did not have the United boss' approval<b>. Inter paid United £74million on the final day </b>of the Premier League transfer window in August, <b>ending months of speculation over the striker's future</b>. But in an interview with Het Belang van Limburg, Lukaku said his departure was decided as early as March.</p>
      <p>"Solskjaer has my eternal respect," said Lukaku. "<b>He understood me when I said in March </b>that it was time for me to leave. I had been in the Premier League as an 18-year-old boy and now I am 26. <b>Solskjaer wanted to keep me,</b> but I was ready for something new."</p>

      <p><b>Lukaku has scored nine goals in 12 Serie A appearances</b> for Inter, but was subjected to racist abuse by Cagliari fans in September. He said he knew what to expect when he arrived in Italy, and <b>insisted he is enjoying his time in Milan</b>.</p>
      <p>"<b>I knew it would happen</b>," said Lukaku. "I was prepared because I had spoken to other footballers about it. But I'm having a good time in Italy. <b>The people on the street are very good to me </b>and it's on that, that I want to focus."</p>
