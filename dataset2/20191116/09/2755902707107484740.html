      <p>Machete attackers gang leader Taurai Mutandwa was shot dead on Thursday in shootout with the police during a gold wrangle near David Whitehead in Chegutu.</p>
      <p>Mutandwa, who was also known as Kwadez, was on the police wanted list allegedly for running most of the machete-related crimes in the area and he ran a dangerous gang called Team Barca.</p>
      <p>Chegutu District Development Coordinator Mr Tariro Tomu <a href="https://www.herald.co.zw/machete-gang-leader-shot-dead/">confirmed that about 7 people had been injured in machete wars </a>between artisanal miners during the gold rush, while 33 had been arrested by Thursday.</p>
      <aside>“Gold was discovered on 12 November at a dumpsite near David Whitehead in a trench,” he said.<br/>“There was a rush of miners. A total of seven people are said to have been injured in the attacks between the gold panners armed with some machetes.<br/>“Police managed to disperse the gold panners and had to camp on the site. On Monday, there was an exchange of gunfire between the police and groups of artisanal miners.<br/>“Taurai Mutandwa was shot dead during the gunfire that took place between the group and police on site, and so far more than 33 people have been arrested and five vehicles recovered.”</aside>
