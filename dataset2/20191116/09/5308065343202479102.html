      <p>Marvel casting director Sarah Finn explained in an Avengers:Endgame featurette on Disney+ that Robert Downey Jr at that point in his career was not a family-friendly name and he did not have people’s approval to be part of the film at first.</p>
      <p>Concerns were raised about whether he was an action hero or if his name can promote a family movie. Jon Favreau liked the idea of Downey playing the role and Finn felt they were sure about him on a creative level.</p>
      <p>Finn also shared that because Robert Downey Jr. isn’t a slam-dunk approval and they were reading other people and looking at it, she suggested that they had screen tests and let the best person win.</p>
      <p>The choice to cast Robert Downey Jr. was a good decision with the actor<a href="https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/oscars/a29734978/avengers-endgame-cast-robert-downey-jr-oscars/"> up for Oscar consideration</a> for his performance in Avengers:Endgame.</p>
      <p>In Iron Man 2, the issues of substance abuse and addiction were explored but <a href="https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/a643454/robert-downey-jr-walks-out-of-awkward-channel-4-interview-after-drug-questions/">just don’t ask RDJ about it in an interview</a>.</p>
      <p>Born Robert John Downey Jr., is an American actor, producer and singer.</p>
      <p>In his youth, he went through a period of substance abuse and legal troubles before recovering and gaining success in his middle age.</p>
      <p>Named by Time magazine as the 100 most influential people in the world in 2008, he was also named by Forbes as Hollywood’s highest-paid actor from 2013 to 2015.</p>
