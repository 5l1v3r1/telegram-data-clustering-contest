      <p>Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie will meet General Election candidates and local activists before heading out to canvass in west Glasgow, while Scottish Conservative leader Jackson Carlaw will give a campaign speech at a Newton Mearns hotel.</p>
      <p>During her visits to Arbroath and Ellon, Ms Sturgeon is expected to cite no-deal Brexit analysis by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, which found north-east Scotland faces a potential hit of 6.3% to GDP - the highest fall anywhere in the UK.</p>

      <p>Ms Sturgeon will say: "The north-east of Scotland is a vital part of Scotland's economy - but that is now under threat with it set to be the hardest-hit part of the UK from a Tory Brexit.</p>
      <p>"It's clear that at this election, a vote for the SNP is a vote to protect Scotland from the serious economic damage that a hard Tory Brexit will do.</p>
      <p>"And with the Brexit Party pulling the Tories' strings, it is increasingly likely that the Tories - if they are re-elected - will go for a no-deal Brexit at the end of next year, damaging the economy even further."</p>
      <p>On his election campaign visit, Mr Rennie will highlight his party's climate change policies.</p>
      <p>Speaking ahead of the visit, he said: "A Liberal Democrat government will take bold action to address the climate crisis now.</p>
      <p>"Global warming is the biggest problem facing the UK and it's putting our children's future at risk.</p>
      <p>"We are determined to stop Brexit so we can get on with building a brighter future for our planet."</p>
