      <p>Inter manager <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/antonio-conte/">Antonio Conte</a> is reportedly under police protection in Italy after receiving a bullet in the post.</p>
      <p>According to Corriere della Sera and Gazzetta dello Sport, the former <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/chelsea-fc/">Chelsea</a> boss received an envelope from an anonymous sender containing a bullet and a letter which issued a series of threats.</p>
      <p>An investigation has now been launched while Conte is now under police surveillance outside his home and at Inter’s training ground.</p>
      <p>Several political figures in Italy have been sent similar threats through the post including Silvio Berlusconi, the country’s former prime minister.</p>

      <p>Reports claim that police are taking the matter seriously but believe the anonymous sender is simply seeking attention and the threats towards Conte will not result in any ‘real aggression’.</p>
      <p>Conte joined Inter in the summer and his side are currently one point behind Juventus at the top of Serie A.</p>

      <p>The 50-year-old also spent two seasons at Chelsea, winning both the Premier League and the FA Cup during his time at Stamford Bridge.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Conte won his legal battle against Chelsea and the club were ordered to pay the Italian £9 million in compensation after sacking him last summer.</p>
