      <p>An air traffic controller from Pakistan’s Civil Aviation Authority guided a plane flying from Jaipur to Muscat, the capital city of Oman, after its pilot sounded an alert due to bad weather.</p>
      <p>Sources in the aviation authority have said that the plane encountered abnormal weather conditions near the Chor area of the southern Sindh province.</p>
      <p>According to a report in <i>The News International</i>, the plane, carrying 150 passengers, was flying over Karachi region on Thursday when it got caught in the middle of lightning and dropped down from an altitude of 36,000 feet to 34,000 feet almost immediately.</p>
      <p>As a result, the pilot initiated emergency protocol and broadcast “Mayday” to nearby stations.</p>
      <p>The air traffic controller from Pakistan responded to the call of the pilot and directed it through the dense air traffic in the vicinity for the remaining journey in the Pakistani airspace.</p>
