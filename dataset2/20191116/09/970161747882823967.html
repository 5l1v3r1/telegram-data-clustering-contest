      <h1>Paramedic finds 'disgusting' handwritten note on ambulance blocking driveway</h1>

      <p>A paramedic returned to find an abusive note left on her ambulance after responding to an emergency call.</p>
      <p>Lauren Wheeler from Harlow, Essex, was helping someone in need in Southend-on-Sea when an unidentified neighbour wrote a ‘disgusting’ letter that slammed the ambulance worker for blocking their driveway.</p>
      <p>The note, written all in block capitals, read: ‘Don’t care if you’re an ambulance you can’t block people’s driveways!</p>
      <p>‘Either ask or f***ing come out when we beep the horn for 10 minutes’.</p>
      <p>Lauren posted the note on Facebook under the caption: ‘Love getting cute notes in my job’ with a laughing crying emoji.</p>
      <p>Outrage was sparked by the note, with multiple people naming the situation ‘unbelievable’.</p>
      <p>John Kear wrote: ‘Don’t care if you are a human, you CANT be that much of a d**khead.’</p>

      <p>Responding to angry comments, Lauren joked: ‘I will make sure I knock on everyone’s door for the rest of the night’, along with an eye roll emoji.</p>
      <p>In a statement, a spokeswoman for East of England Ambulance Service urged residents to think about whether their driveways being blocked was more important than saving a neighbour’s life.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘We are asking members of the public who abuse ambulance crews over parking issues to remember they are there to save lives.</p>
      <p>‘This plea follows an abusive note being left on an ambulance parked in Southend while crews were attending a medical emergency last night.</p>

      <p>‘Our crews are instructed to be considerate where they park.</p>
      <p>‘However in areas where parking is limited, an ambulance may need to park in the first available space to attend a critically ill or injured patient.</p>
      <p>‘No-one deserves to be abused for doing their job, so if a marked ambulance is parked across your drive for a few minutes, please think – is your parking space more important than a neighbour’s life?’</p>
