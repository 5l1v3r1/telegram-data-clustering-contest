      <p><b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/Rowdy_Yates">Rowdy Yates</a></b> kept his record clean at Remington Park with his second stakes win in a row. Next stop: looking for <b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/p/c/Kentucky_Derby_2020_Contenders">2020 Kentucky Derby</a></b> points in the closing night $400,000 <b>Springboard Mile</b> for 2-year-olds on Dec. 15.</p>
      <p>On Friday night, Rowdy Yates proved to be the class of the field in the $75,000 Don McNeill Memorial Stakes, winning by 4 3/4 lengths, and it probably should have been an even greater margin. This 2-year-old colt by Morning Line, out of the Yes It’s True mare Spring Station, was blocked behind horses when he wanted to make his move in the one-mile race and had to wait to pull clear. Jockey Richard Eramia finally pulled him wide in mid-stretch, when the juvenile colt found another gear.</p>
      <p>The 1-5 favorite, Rowdy Yates won like an odds-on choice should, covering the mile in 1:39.59 seconds in the race for Oklahoma-bred 2-year-olds.</p>
      <p>“We were waiting and waiting, but we had a lot of horse left,” Eramia said. “When he did get clear, it was clean sailing. Good horses do everything good.”</p>
      <p>Rowdy Yates is trained by leading conditioner Steve Asmussen for L and N Racing of Tulsa, Okla. That conglomerate is made up of Lee Levinson, his son Mike, and their friend, Don Nelson.</p>
      <p>“My buddy and his son know how to pick horses,” said Nelson.</p>
      <p>Kirkcules ran second to Rowdy Yates and was a half-length ahead of the second favorite in the field, at 5-2 odds, Fly to the Bank who was third.</p>
      <p>The interior fractions for the race were not swift, so it was not a simple task for Rowdy Yates to catch the early leaders after the tough first half mile. They went the opening quarter mile in :24.71 seconds, the half mile in :49.33 seconds and six furlongs in 1:14.64. The seven-furlong time was 1:27.21. By then, Rowdy Yates had taken over.</p>
      <p>Rowdy Yates paid $2.40 to win, $2.10 to place and $2.10 to show. Rowdy Yates was bred in Oklahoma by Tracy Strachan. Lee Levinson said he was given a tip on this horse at the Fasig-Tipton Sale at Keeneland in Kentucky in 2018. He spent $42,000 to get him despite his suspect breeding, and so far it has paid off. It was the first win in this race for all the connections.</p>
      <p>“We thought we could have won the Bashford Manor,” said Lee Levinson. “And hopefully we can the Springboard, too.”</p>
      <p>On the national scene, Rowdy Yates has run second by three-quarters of a length in that Grade 3 stakes at Churchill Downs and fifth to the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile favorite, Dennis’ Moment, in the Iroquois Stakes (G3), also at Churchill.</p>
      <p>Through six career races, Rowdy Yates has four victories and one second-place effort. He picked up $45,000 for his score in the McNeill, moving his overall earnings to $210,898.</p>
      <p>The Don McNeill Stakes is named in honor of the late owner and breeder who was so prominent in Oklahoma-bred racing, represented by many talented horses including top Oklahoma-breds Clever Trevor and Mr. Ross, as well as 2011 Breeders’ Cup Dirt Mile winner Caleb’s Posse.</p>
