      <h1>Bitcoin Cash Hard Fork Sees Miners ‘Waste’ Money on 14 Invalid Blocks</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T09:13:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 09:13</time> by <a rel="author">William Suberg</a></address>
      <p>Bitcoin Cash (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-cash-price-index">BCH</a>) miners appear to have wasted money mining 14 blocks on the wrong chain after the altcoin underwent a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/hard-fork">hard fork</a>. </p>
      <p>According to data from monitoring resource <a href="https://forkmonitor.info/nodes/bch">Fork Monitor</a> on Nov. 15, Bitcoin Cash, which itself forked off from Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) in 2017, successfully split in two once again on Friday.</p>
      <h3>BitMEX: Miners are “wasting resources”</h3>
      <p>Despite being broadly cleaner than its previous hard fork attempts, it soon became apparent that a large section of miners had not upgraded to the new chain. </p>
      <p>In total, miners spent resources mining 14 empty blocks on a chain that the majority of the Bitcoin Cash network already considered invalid and rejected.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/BitMEXResearch/status/1195424900623810560">BitMEX Research</a>, the analytics arm of trading platform <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitmex">BitMEX</a> which owns Fork Monitor, commented during the hard fork:</p>
      <blockquote>“The original rules chain has no transactions (other than the coinbases) due to the transaction replay protection measure Non upgraded Bitcoin Cash miners appear to be wasting resources.” </blockquote>
      <p>At press time, just 77% of Bitcoin Cash nodes were compatible and using the latest consensus rules, statistics from <a href="https://cash.coin.dance/nodes">Coin Dance</a> show. </p>
      <p>Theoretically, those miners could have missed out on block rewards worth 12.5 BCH ($3,337) per block or a total of 175 BCH ($584,062). In reality, however, it is almost mathematically impossible that the same miner would unlock the block reward for so many blocks in a row.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin Cash price fails to react</h3>
      <p>Nodes can be left behind during hard forks for various reasons, often due to accidentally forgetting to upgrade before the block set to trigger the hard fork. </p>
      <p>The inefficiency nonetheless piled publicity on Bitcoin Cash and major proponent <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/roger-ver">Roger Ver</a>. Ver, in particular, has become a highly controversial figure in cryptocurrency due to his <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/roger-ver-says-5-bitcoin-cash-giveaway-could-be-worth-5-000-someday">arguably unsuccessful</a> campaign to plant BCH as a superior alternative to BTC. </p>
      <p>Pro-Bitcoin figures took Ver’s allies to task on social media. These included <a href="https://twitter.com/notgrubles/status/1195406591513812992">Olivier Janssens</a>, who previously argued that a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/nodes">node</a> “doesn’t matter” in a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/decentralization">decentralized</a> peer-to-peer network and that removing Bitcoin’s block size cap was, therefore, essential to avoid hostile takeovers.</p>
      <p>The hard fork meanwhile failed to lift the poor performance of BCH/USD, which has shed around 3.2% in the 24 hours since the hard fork. At $267, the altcoin remains 93% down versus its all-time high of $3,920 achieved in December 2017.</p>
