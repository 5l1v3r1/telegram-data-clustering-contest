      <p>Viewers know <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-spoiler-jais-son-makes-a-shock-return-to-the-village-as-rachel-dies/">Archie is struggling after the death of his mum Rachel</a> but Arthur seems determined to make his life a misery.</p>
      <p>After hearing Jai and Laurel rowing over his claims that <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-spoilers-jimmys-accused-of-abusing-archie/">Jimmy was responsible for hurting Archie</a>, Arthur turned nasty.</p>
      <p>He shouted vile things at little Archie before grabbing the phone he was playing games on and smashing it to pieces.</p>
      <p>"You're so stupid," he said.</p>
      <aside>Tell on me and you'll be sorry.</aside>
      <p>"You're a pathetic little baby, you're not even old enough to understand that game properly, just give it to me."</p>
      <p>With that he grabbed the phone and stamped on it, wrecking it in the process before quickly deciding to blame Archie for his own abuse and warning him not to say anything.</p>

      <p>"Tell on me and you'll be sorry," he said as Archie ran to his dad and apologised for breaking the phone, terrified of what Arthur would do to him.</p>
      <p>Twisted Arthur then lied: "He got cross because he couldn't play he game properly, I tried to help him but he chucked it down and stamped on it."</p>
      <p>It was enough to terrify viewers of the soap about Arthur's villainy.</p>
      <p>One said: "Arthur is deeply terrifying. The kid is going to win Best Villain at the Soap Awards surely."</p>
      <p>A second tweeted: "Arthur has got the devil in him."</p>
      <p>A third said: "Jesus christ, Arthur is a little [expletive]!"</p>
