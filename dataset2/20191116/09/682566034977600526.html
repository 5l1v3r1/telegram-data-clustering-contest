      <p>London - <b>Rafael Nadal</b> was unable to crown his season with a first ATP Finals title but he ends it as world No 1 and with a chance to lead Spain to Davis Cup glory.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard, who came to London under an injury cloud, had a terrible start to his week at the O2 Arena, crushed in straight sets by defending champion Alexander Zverev in his first round-robin match.</p>
      <p>But he produced a performance of astonishing grit to recover from 5-1 and match point down against Daniil Medvedev and saw off Stefanos Tsitsipas in three sets on Friday.</p>
      <p>It was not quite enough to reach the semi-finals but Nadal leaves London after securing the year-end No 1 ranking for a fifth time, pulling level with Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic.</p>
      <p>Nadal was in the strange position after his win against 21-year-old Tsitsipas of not knowing whether he would be heading home or playing Federer in the knockouts.</p>
      <p>Later, Zverev's win against Medvedev confirmed his tournament was over.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old, who was presented with the trophy for securing the No 1 spot on court, said it was difficult to compare the achievement with winning a Grand Slam.</p>
      <p>Nadal is now on 19 majors, just one behind Federer after winning his 12th French Open this year and his fourth US Open crown.</p>
      <p>"I know it is something so important because to achieve this you have to play well for 11 months," he said.</p>
      <p>"To win a Grand Slam you have to play well two weeks. But it's difficult to compare. For me personally, when you win a Grand Slam, you win a Grand Slam winning the last point, and that feeling you, can't have it here. That's the big difference."</p>
      <p>But he said finishing on top of the world was a great achievement after his struggles with injuries earlier in the season.</p>
      <p>And he was delighted to pull level on five year-end finishes with Djokovic and Federer - the other two members of the "Big Three".</p>
      <p>Nadal can look back on another staggering year in which he has shown remarkable consistency, winning four trophies including two Masters titles.</p>
      <p>He reached the semi-finals at all four Grand Slams in a season for just the second time in his illustrious career.</p>
      <p>But it did not start too promisingly for the veteran, who was plagued by injuries early in the season, including a thigh strain and right knee injury.</p>
      <p>The injury jinx struck again late on, forcing him to miss October's Shanghai Masters with a wrist injury and his participation at the ATP Finals was in doubt after he withdrew from the Paris Masters at the semi-final stage with an abdominal strain.</p>
      <p>But now the dust has settled, Nadal can look back on another staggering season in which he overtook Djokovic in the final stretch to top the rankings.</p>
      <p>"My decision or our decision is to try to do the things to play as long as possible, so that's why I tried to do the conservative calendar in terms of saving the body and everything," said Nadal.</p>
      <p>"But the thing is when I have been playing, I have been playing very well. I achieved almost every single time the last rounds of every tournament.</p>
      <p>"So that's why I'm put in a position that I am where I am today, having this trophy with me."</p>
      <p>And it is not over yet for the Spaniard.</p>
      <p>Nadal has the chance to lead Spain to glory in the new-look Davis Cup in Madrid next week and he is raring to go.</p>
      <p>Changes to the tournament's format mean 18 teams will be vying for the title over the course of a week.</p>
      <p>"Let's see how the thing works," he said. "I am sure that they did great and it is going to be something really special. And playing at home even more.</p>
      <p>"So excited about it. I really hope that the team is working the right way during these previous days of the tournament, so I really expect to find a team very well-prepared when I arrive there."</p>
