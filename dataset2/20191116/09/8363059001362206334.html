      <h1>Slide Into the Weekend With the Most Hilarious Wildlife Photos of 2019</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T09:00:39+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author">Catie Keck</a></address>
      <p>Folks, if you aren’t heading into your weekend with an image of a king penguin forsaking public pool etiquette and absolutely unloading his ass without shame or a rhino pissing all over a bird, you’re not doing it right.</p>
      <p>These incredible images, and a selection of other similarly spectacular wildlife photography, comes courtesy the annual <a href="https://www.comedywildlifephoto.com/">Comedy Wildlife Photography Awards</a>. The annual <a href="https://gizmodo.com/behold-the-most-hilarious-wildlife-photos-of-2017-1821301269?_ga=2.121141835.231078483.1573407900-248962609.1559160032">photo</a> <a href="https://gizmodo.com/these-are-the-winners-of-the-2015-comedy-wildlife-award-1749107363">competition</a> is rooted in raising awareness about wildlife conservation while celebrating the outtake moments of wildlife photography. It’s free to enter, and this year saw a reported 4,000 entries across 68 countries. Those thousands of photo entries were then pared down to <a href="https://www.comedywildlifephoto.com/gallery/2019_finalists.php">40 finalists</a> before the winners were announced this week.</p>
      <p>This year’s overall winner in the competition was an image snapped by photographer Sarah Skinner. Titled “Grab life by the…” – which you can clearly see below means “balls” – depicts a lion cub at the Chobe National Park in Botswana nearly catch some skin. (Thankfully, according to a quote provided to <a href="https://www.insider.com/funny-animal-photos-comedy-wildlife-photography-awards-2019">Business Insider</a>, the cub missed and the older lion made away without a scratch.)</p>

      <p>“It certainly warms my heart to know that this image will spread some laughter and happiness around the world,” Skinner said in a statement. “I am happy to report that this lioness continues to thrive in the pride, having seen her again in October this year. I can only hope and encourage everyone, as a collective to each do our part in the conservation of all wildlife species, so that future generations can enjoy them, in the same way that I have done during my career as a wildlife photographer.”</p>
      <p>There were, of course, plenty more winners – including our aforementioned king penguin. For your viewing pleasure, I present: “Inconspicuous.”</p>
