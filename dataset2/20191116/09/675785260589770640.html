      <h1>Joe Gomez withdrawn from England squad ahead of Kosovo game</h1>
      <h2>Joe Gomez has not travelled to Kosovo for England's final Euro 2020 qualifier with Liverpool team-mate Jordan Henderson also ruled out</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T09:37:24+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 09:37</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>England defender Joe Gomez has been withdrawn from England's squad to take on Kosovo on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Gomez was booed by fans when he was introduced against Montenegro on Thursday having been involved in a clash with team-mate Raheem Sterling in training last Monday.</p>
      <p>He has now been ruled out of the trip to Kosovo with a knock picked up in training on Friday and will return to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> for treatment.</p>
      <p>He will be joined back on Merseyside by team-mate Jordan Henderson, who has also been ruled out of England's final Euro 2020 qualifier due to a viral infection which has not fully cleared.</p>
      <p>Gomez is believed to have suffered an impact injury in a tackle with Kieran Trippier which is not thought to be serious.</p>

      <p>Liverpool will be hoping both the defender and Henderson will recover in time to feature in their trip to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> when Premier League action resumes next weekend.</p>
      <p>Gomez was reportedly left devastated by the reaction he received from fans in Thursday's 7-0 win, days after the incident which saw Sterling punished.</p>
      <p>The jeers were condemned by Gareth Southgate at full-time as he pledged to support the player.</p>
      <p>Southgate said: "Joe had done nothing wrong.</p>

      <p>"No England player should be booed when they wear the shirt. We're a team. I don't understand that.</p>
      <p>"Him and Raheem are very close, and the team are very close, so we don't want to see anyone treated in that way. All of the players are particularly disappointed with that.</p>
      <p>“I’m hugely disappointed for him, but he’s got the support of all of us - the whole dressing room, totally united. And we’ll make sure we’re there for him."</p>
