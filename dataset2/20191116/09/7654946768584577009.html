        <i>While<a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/myles-garrett-uses-helmet-to-clock-mason-rudolphs-head-in-fight/"> Myles Garrett clocking Mason Rudolph</a> with his own helmet Thursday night was the peak of a brutal in-game fight, the Browns defensive end has some company. Here are some of the other dirtiest fights that have taken place on courts, fields and the ice:</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Kermit Washington vs. Rudy Tomjanovich (Dec. 9, 1977)</b>
      </p>
      <p>As a scuffle near midcourt broke out between the Lakers and Rockets, Houston’s Tomjanovich began running toward it. But he never got there, as Washington got free and wound up for a clear shot at Tomjanovich’s face. The vicious punch knocked Tomjanovich on his back and he was left unconscious. The punch fractured his skull, jaw and nose and nearly killed him. Washington was fined $10,000 and suspended 60 days.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Juan Marichal vs. Johnny Roseboro (Aug. 22, 1965)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Like Garrett, Marichal went to battle with a piece of equipment. The Giants pitcher was up to bat against the Dodgers in a game that had featured plenty of high heat. After one pitch, the catcher Roseboro’s throw back to the mound nearly hit Marichal, which set him off. Marichal took his bat and struck Roseboro on the head, sparking a brawl. Marichal was fined $1,750 and suspended eight games, while Roseboro needed 14 stitches to close a gash.</p>

        <b>Todd Bertuzzi vs. Steve Moore (March 8, 2004)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The NHL permits fighting, but not like this. Canucks winger Bertuzzi tried to get Moore to drop the gloves but the Avalanche center declined, so Bertuzzi took matters into his own hands. He skated after Moore and sucker-punched him from behind, knocking him unconscious. Moore fell on his face, with Bertuzzi on his back. Moore was eventually taken off on a stretcher and suffered fractured vertebrae, facial cuts and a concussion, ending his career. Bertuzzi was suspended for the rest of the season (20 games) and charged in British Columbia with assault causing bodily harm, to which he pleaded guilty and received probation.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Albert Haynesworth vs. Andre Gurode (Oct. 1, 2006)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Before Garrett, Titans defensive tackle Haynesworth had been guilty of the NFL’s cheapest shot. Gurode’s helmet came off during a play and Haynesworth made it hurt, stomping on his head and creating a cut near the Cowboys center’s eye that needed 30 stitches. Haynesworth wasn’t even ejected until he threw his own helmet on the ground when the 15-yard penalty was announced. The Titans defensive tackle was then suspended five games.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Marty McSorley vs. Donald Brashear (Feb. 21, 2000)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Tensions had been boiling in a game between the Bruins and Canucks but got completely out of line in the final five seconds of the third period. Boston’s McSorley skated after Brashear and clubbed him in the head with his stick. The strike hit Brashear in the temple and he fell to the ice, losing consciousness and suffering a seizure. Brashear was also diagnosed with a Grade 3 concussion while McSorley was charged with and convicted of assault with a weapon in British Columbia and never played another NHL game.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Miami vs. Florida International (Oct. 14, 2006)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The fight broke out on an extra-point attempt, of all plays. There was bad blood before that, but tempers finally flared on a third-quarter PAT. The brawl included punching, kicking, swinging helmets and even swinging crutches before it was broken up. When the dust finally settled, 13 players had been ejected and by the next day, 31 players had been suspended.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Mike Tyson vs. Evander Holyfield (June 28, 1997)</b>
      </p>
      <p>During the third round of their fight, with Holyfield dominating, Tyson bit a chunk out of Holyfield’s right ear. The fight was temporarily stopped and Tyson was deducted two points. When it resumed, Tyson bit Holyfield’s left ear, stopping the fight. Tyson’s boxing license was suspended for more than a year by the Nevada State Athletic Commission.</p>
