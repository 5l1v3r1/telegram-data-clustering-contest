      <h2>Engineers used equipment to suck up excess water and clear clogged drains.</h2>

      <p>Highways England worked through the night to ensure the A52 was reopened after it was battered by heavy rain and started to flood.</p>
      <p>The A52 Radcliffe Road westbound was closed due to flooding from A46 to A6011 (Gamston roundabout) near to <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/">Bassingfield Lane</a> on Friday, November 16.</p>
      <p>Highways contractors used specialist equipment to suck up excess water and clear clogged drains.</p>
      <p>Motorists were told to avoid the Saxondale and Gamston area and diversions were put in place.</p>
      <p>Just before 7pm on Friday night, engineers reduced the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/live-updates-roads-buses-friday-3540623">standing water on the A52</a> westbound and opened one lane.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Highways England said: "All the standing water on the A52 westbound has been cleared and the road returned to all lanes running around 2am this morning."</p>
