      <p>The Apprentice stars Lottie Lion and Ryan-Mark have confirmed they are actually ‘<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dating/">dating</a>’ after fans noticed how close they have gotten on the show.</p>
      <p>A fan of The Apprentice tweeted Ryan-Mark after Wednesday night’s show to comment on their friendship.</p>
      <p>They tweeted: ‘Just watched last night’s episode of the apprentice, another brilliant episode. My favourites so far are<br/>@LottieLion1 @ryanmarkparsons and @ImLewisEllis</p>
      <p>‘I’ve noticed Lottie and Ryan-Mark have quite the friendship.’</p>
      <p>The candidate then added fuel to the fire by responding: ‘We’re actually dating. EXCLUSIVE.’</p>

      <p>Lottie then weighed in confirming the news as she tweeted: ‘Public Service Announcement after much speculation’</p>
      <p>Fans were quick to respond to the news – and it’s safe some people found it funny – and others were just a bit confused.</p>

      <p>Although some viewers took the opportunity to send their congratulations.</p>
      <p>Ryan-Mark continued to joke about their relationship by later tweeting a picture of Lottie as they went ‘baby clothes shopping’.</p>
      <p>The pair haven’t confirmed whether they are joking with fans or not (but either way we love it).</p>

      <p>Lottie, who was i<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/13/apprentice-investigates-lottie-lion-racism-accusations-told-rival-shut-ghandi-10911610/">n the centre of a ‘racism’ storm at the beginning of this Apprentice series,</a> has also been responding to fans on social media who are calling for her to go <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/10/the-apprentices-lottie-lion-backs-calls-to-get-her-on-im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here-2020-11076279/">into the Australian jungle for I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here in 2020.</a></p>
      <p>And while the librarian has been retweeting the calls to ‘get her in the jungle’, she hasn’t responded as to whether she would take part or not.</p>
      <p>One questioned: ‘You like the idea then Lottie?’</p>
      <p>Another tweeted: ‘Lottie needs to be in I’m A Celeb next year’</p>
