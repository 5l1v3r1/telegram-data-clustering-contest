      <p>On Wednesday, members of the House Intelligence Committee questioned two witnesses in the first public hearing of the Trump impeachment inquiry: William Taylor, the acting Ambassador to Ukraine, and George Kent, a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State. Taylor was, as <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/william-taylors-unspinnable-testimony-against-donald-trump">Eric Lach wrote</a>, “sober and deliberate.” In his opening statement and in his responses to the committee members’ questions, Taylor described the Trump Administration’s “confusing and unusual arrangement for making U.S. policy toward the Ukraine.” Kent told a similar story, describing efforts by Rudy Giuliani, President Trump’s personal lawyer, to pressure the government of Ukraine to “gin up” investigations into Trump’s political rivals—efforts that Kent said wound up “infecting U.S. engagement with Ukraine.”</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, as Taylor and Kent offered their testimony, Republicans on the committee did their best to scoff at, undercut, and make a circus of the proceedings. “There is one witness,” <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/jim-jordan-tries-to-recast-trump-as-the-hero-of-the-ukraine-scandal">Jim Jordan</a>, the Ohio Republican who was recently appointed to the committee to serve as a kind of inquisitorial ringer, said, “one witness they won’t bring in front of us, they won’t bring in front of the American people, and that’s the guy who started it all—the whistle-blower.” As Adam Gopnik <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/why-is-trump-obsessed-with-outing-the-whistle-blower">has written</a>, the anonymous government whistle-blower who submitted a complaint about Trump’s July 25th call with the President of Ukraine—the complaint that set off a sequence of events that has resulted in the impeachment inquiry—has emerged as a kind of “comic-book nemesis” for the President. Representative Peter Welch, a Democrat from Vermont, responded. “I’d be glad to have the person who started it all come in and testify. President Trump is welcome,” he said, gesturing to the witness tables and eliciting a brief moment of laughter, “to take a seat right there.”</p>
      <p>On Friday, the witness slated to appear before the committee is the former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, whose ouster, in May, caused wide concern among members of the Foreign Service. In September, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-floodgates-open-on-trump">David Remnick wrote</a> that Yovanovitch was known as a “deeply knowledgeable, experienced, and nonpartisan diplomat” who had “wound up on the wrong side of the Trump circle.” Unlike Taylor or Kent, Yovanovitch wasn’t just a witness to the machinations at the heart of the impeachment probe—she was subject to them.
