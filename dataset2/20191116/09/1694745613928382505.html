      <p>"My favorite Indian food from Trader Joe's is the frozen Channa Masala — chickpeas cooked in a spiced tomato sauce. With no weird preservatives or unnecessary ingredients (plus no cream, a bonus for me), this vegetarian dish is seriously authentic. Serve it over basmati rice or with naan, and you've got yourself a restaurant-worthy meal." — Erin Cullum, assistant editor, Food</p>
      <h3>2 Trader Joe's Chicken Tikka Masala ($3)</h3>

      <p>"Combined, my sister and I have probably eaten over 500 boxes of Trader Joe's Chicken Tikka Masala. It's delicious and perfect to pack for the office or heat up after a long day at work (pro tip: it's also helped cure a hangover or two). It feels like comfort food but is portioned so perfectly that I'm satisfied without doing damage to my diet (which I cannot say for Indian delivery)." — Lizzy Eisenberg, director, Business Development</p>
      <p>"Rivals the best Indian food restaurants — and it's frozen!" — Shannon Vestal, director, Celebrity and Entertainment</p>

      <p>"I was somewhat of a skeptic when it came to Indian food until I visited <a href="http://www.babujinyc.com/">Babu Ji in NYC</a>. Since then I've embraced everything about the cuisine.

      <p>"While not as good as the real thing, the simmer sauces make dinner such an easy process. Add chicken and veggies to the sauce, heat it up, and you're done. Super easy, quick, and flavorful! We like to serve it alongside TJ's premade naan for a complete meal." — Michele Foley, senior editor, Fitness</p>
