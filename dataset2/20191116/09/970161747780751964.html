      <p>While the rest of us are still in mourning after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/avengers/">Avengers</a>: Endgame, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/disney/">Disney</a> have been keeping themselves busy, setting the release dates for the next five Marvel movies.</p>
      <p>Buckle in guys.</p>
      <p>Despite us having a pretty huge Marvel gap at the moment, with 10 months between the release of Spider-Man: Far From Home in July 2019 and Black Widow in February 2020, we’re getting spoiled down the line.</p>
      <p>According <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/disney-sets-2021-release-ridley-scotts-last-duel-pushes-back-kings-man-7-months-1255349">to The Hollywood Reporter,</a> the franchise has set currently unknown releases for October 7, 2022, February 17, 2023, May 5, 2023, July 28, 2023, and November 3, 2023.</p>

      <p>So we’ll be getting two Marvel movies in 2020, four in 2021, four in 2022, and another four in 2023. This is not a drill guys.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, in the midst of the Great Marvel Drought Of 2019 as we’ve officially named it, fans have been getting their fix from Disney+ after its launch.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>In fact, they’ve gone full force and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/avengers-endgame-confirmed-join-marvel-collection-disney-plus-tomorrow-11081045/">added much of the Marvel back catalogue to the service.</a></p>
      <p>They also announced a new special called Expanding The Universe, teasing the new TV series that will be attached to the larger MCU.</p>
      <p>This includes Falcon and The Winter Soldier, which has just started production, and stars characters Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) as the heroes themselves.</p>

      <p>WandaVision, starring Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany), has also been announced, as has a spin-off series focusing on Loki (Tom Hiddleston).</p>
      <p>Joining Avengers: Endgame on the streaming service is a large collection of Marvel favourites. Captain Marvel, the Iron Man trilogy, Guardians of the Galaxy 1+2 and Avengers Assemble and Age of Ultron.</p>
      <p>Although there are still some notable absences from the collection, including Thor: Ragnarok, Ant-Man and The Wasp, and the Spider-Man collection.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, although we’ve got to wait a while for a new Marvel movie, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/star-wars-naomi-ackie-warns-rise-skywalker-ending-will-leave-fans-questions-11127079/">Disney are cracking on with Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker,</a> which is set for release in December.</p>
      <p>Too much Disney to handle!</p>
