      <h1>Joe Gomez and Jordan Henderson set to miss England’s game against Kosovo</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T09:53:20+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 09:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/mattaddison/" target="_blank">Matt Addison</a></address>
      <p>Joe Gomez and Jordan Henderson have both pulled out of the England squad that is to face Kosovo tomorrow because of injury and illness respectively.</p>
      <p>Gomez, who was left devasted this week after being booed at Wembley despite being the victim in the Raheem Sterling incident, has a knee injury, while Henderson was ill last week before facing Manchester City, and is under the weather once again.</p>
      <blockquote>Joe Gomez out of England squad after picking up knee injury in training following collision with Kieran Trippier. Jordan Henderson out with illness<br/>— paul joyce (@_pauljoyce) <a href="https://twitter.com/_pauljoyce/status/1195637256788287488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 16, 2019</a></blockquote>
      <p>Both players will hope to be back sooner rather than later. The Henderson illness does not sound like too big a thing, and he should be fine to face Crystal Palace next weekend, but the Gomez knock is more of a concern.</p>
      <p>It might do him good to be out of the way as Sterling makes his England return after being removed from the team to play against Montenegro, but he will be desperate to avoid another spell on the sidelines.</p>
      <p>Gomez missed much of last season through injury and has not got back to his best since.</p>
