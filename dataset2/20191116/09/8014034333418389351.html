      <p>BAMAKO, Mali — Mali’s military has abandoned some of its most isolated outposts in the desert north while extremist attacks have killed more than 100 soldiers in just six weeks.</p>
      <p>The West African nation’s president is facing a decline in military morale, a sentiment that helped spark a coup against his predecessor in 2012 amid an uprising that saw separatists and Islamic fighters take over large swaths of the north.</p>
      <p>Some also are angry at a French military presence.</p>
      <p>Mali’s president has pledged “improved conditions for our men,” saying troops will take a more offensive role.</p>
      <p>The extremists add to their weapons stockpile with each raid. Fighters linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group have published images on social media of their spoils of war including automatic weapons, motorcycles and other vehicles.</p>
