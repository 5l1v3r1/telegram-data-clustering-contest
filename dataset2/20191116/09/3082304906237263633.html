      <h1>Cristiano Ronaldo’s sisters slam Juventus boss Maurizio Sarri for substituting him early against AC Milan</h1>

        <b>A few hours after Cristiano Ronaldo scored his 55th career hat-trick in the UEFA Euro 2020 Qualifier game between Portugal and Lithuania, the star forward’s sisters launched a scathing attack on Juventus manager Maurizio Sarri for substituting him early during the recent Serie A clash against AC Milan.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In case you missed it, 34-year-old Ronaldo was subbed off in the 55th minute during the Juventus-AC Milan match on Sunday. Obviously, the ex-Real Madrid and Manchester United ace was not happy at his boss’ decision, and was seen storming off into the dressing room immediately afterwards.</p>
      <p>Later, Sarri insisted that the Portuguese star was struggling with a knee injury, but Ronaldo himself quashed those claims, saying that he was “very good.”</p>
      <p>Instead of just making claims, the five-time <i>Ballon d’Or </i>winner also set about to prove his words, by netting a hat-trick against Lithuania – thereby sparking a reaction from his family as well.</p>
      <p>One sister, Katia Aveiro wrote on <i>Instagram</i> with a picture of Ronaldo: “Don’t mess with him.”</p>

He is fit, so now what?”</p>

      <p>Apparently, Cristiano Ronaldo’s friend Miguel Paixao also took a thinly-veiled dig at former England manager Fabio Capello after he said that Cristiano “hadn’t dribbled past anyone for years.”</p>
      <p>“I think you should have also dribbled past the defence before scoring,” Paizao was quoted as saying.</p>
