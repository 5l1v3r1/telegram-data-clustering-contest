      <h1>'Big mistake' - Latest Liverpool update has Aston Villa fans fuming</h1>
      <h2>Aston Villa v Liverpool in the Carabao Cup | Jurgen Klopp's side will travel to Villa Park once again but this time it will be for a December quarter-final clash</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T09:54:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 09:54</time> by <a rel="author">Shane Ireland, https://www.facebook.com/ShaneIrelandJournalist</a></address>
      <p>Aston Villa have been criticised for the ticket prices against Liverpool after details for the Carabao Cup quarter-final tie were released yesterday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> take on the Reds in the final eight of the competition on Tuesday, December 17 at Villa Park.</p>
      <p>The clash has been the subject of intense interest since the draw was confirmed, because of Liverpool’s involvement in the Club World Cup the same week.</p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp’s side play in the semi-final of the tournament in Qatar under 24 hours after facing Villa.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Most of Liverpool's regulars are expected to head to Doha with <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/fans-been-sent-warning-ahead-17262680">an inexperienced side likely to travel to the Midlands</a> - while <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/dean-smith">Dean Smith</a> also has a packed schedule to contend with.</p>
      <p>Villa beat Wolves at the end of October to set up the clash against Liverpool – in a match which was free to season ticket holders.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/AVFCSupport/status/1195318734933680131">The most expensive tickets for Villa fans against Liverpool are £33 in zone 1</a>, gradually decreasing to £20 for adults in zone 6.</p>
      <p>This is in line with the pricing structure for category C Premier League matches at home but plenty of supporters think it’s too much to pay.</p>

        <i>Here’s what they have been saying...</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>Elie Ward -</b> You’re charging us this and Liverpool £20 max? Unfair and overcharging fans of the club! Bad form.</p>
      <p><b>Spence Browne -</b> Kids and oaps same price as adults, shocking.</p>
      <p><b>Alice -</b> Gunna have a stadium full of Liverpool tourists with those prices.</p>
      <p><b>Max Stokes -</b> Ridiculous prices lads.</p>
      <p><b>Kieran -</b> OK now show the real prices.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><b>Jake -</b> The state of those prices. In my opinion £20’s a push for this fixture with the quality that will probably be displayed. Still can’t get my head around how a kids ticket can cost £33 too.</p>
      <p><b>Pricey -</b> Can I redo the survey you sent me?</p>
      <p><b>Scott -</b> That expensive against Liverpool’s under 21s?</p>
      <p><b>Adam -</b> Think I will give my seat up for this game those prices are ridiculous.</p>
      <p><b>Elliott -</b> For a game on Sky Sports, the week before Christmas and Liverpool's reserves this is absolutely shocking villa. What on earth are you thinking?</p>

      <p><b>Matt -</b> Safe to say the club have completely miss judged it. Its a reserve side vs reserve on Sky. I go home and away with my lad but for this kind of money for the teams put out I will skip this, sad but those prices are ridiculous whoever thought it was acceptable needs head looking at.</p>
      <p><b>Tom Parker -</b> Disgraceful prices at an expensive time of year. Big mistake.</p>
      <p><b>Jamie Tilt -</b> Good luck selling this one out with prices like that.</p>
      <p><b>OviAVFC -</b> Not one to complain usually but prices are ridiculous to go and watch a game against Liverpool's U19s.</p>
