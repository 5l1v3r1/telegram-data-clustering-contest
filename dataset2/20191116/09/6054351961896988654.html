      <p>Los Angeles natives <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53364/title.the-game-grabs-anderson-paak-for-born-to-rap-single-stainless">The Game</a> and <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.50732/title.anderson-paaks-idea-for-ventura-album-had-dr-dre-scratching-his-head">Anderson .Paak</a> are no strangers to representing their city in their music videos. For the visuals to their latest collaborative effort “Stainless,” the pair takes viewers on a late-night drive down Sunset Boulevard.   </p>
      <p>In the Aaron Green-directed clip, the Compton rapper seems to be deep in thought with his pistol at his side as he’s driving a custom baby blue Lamborghini that also pays tribute to the late <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53473/title.nipsey-hussles-alleged-killer-has-motion-denied-in-court">Nipsey Hussle</a>. Paak, on the other hand, is being driven in a sleek, red Mercedes-Benz while crooning his way through the song’s smooth chorus. The pair then meets up with the homies in a parking lot filled with souped-up sportscars and bouncing, candy-colored lowriders. The L.A. vibes in the video fit perfectly with the song as you can hear Game namedrop several notable West Coast figures like Ice Cube, Suge Knight, Dr. Dre and more.</p>
      <p>The clip also features a bit of nostalgia from The Game’s earlier years. The superstar gives a nod to his first two albums <i>The Documentary</i> and <i>Doctor’s Advocate </i>with a scene that features him recreating the album covers by rapping while sitting on top of two gold-plated rims. </p>
      <p>The Big Duke-produced song will be featured on Game’s forthcoming album <i>Born 2 Rap</i> which is expected to drop on November 29. Check out the video above. </p>
