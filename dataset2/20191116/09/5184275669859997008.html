      <p><b>Marjaavaan Box Office:</b> This Milap Zaveri directorial is off to a good start at the ticket windows and is holding its fort strongly especially in the single screens. It has all the ingredients- right from the love angle between Sidharth Malhotra &amp; Tara Sutaria to face off between Sid and Riteish Deshmukh, which are craved by the mass audience.</p>
      <p>Let’s see how <i>Marjaavaan</i> is faring across the major centers for today:</p>

      <p>
        <b>Mumbai</b>
      </p>
      <p>In Mumbai, the condition is quite better than yesterday but overall still stands on a lower side. As of now, the movie is showing around <b>5</b>–<b>7%</b> shows filling fast in advance ticket sale and it will heavily rely on spot bookings for the rest of the day.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Delhi-NCR</b>
      </p>
      <p>This region is known for receiving the mass entertainers with open hands but <i>Marjaavaan</i> is failing to dominate here too, as far as advance booking is concerned. It is on the similar lines of Mumbai but there are few houseful boards across the single screens.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Bengaluru</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bengaluru is consistent on day 2 by staying all green (absence of filling fast shows) and such sort of consistency is definitely not a good sign for the movie.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Hyderabad</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hyderabad is good with around <b>20%</b> shows with really good occupancy in advance ticket sale.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Pune, Kolkata and Chennai</b>
      </p>
      <p>Pune is showing some hopes after staying dull yesterday. Here around <b>5%</b> shows are filling fast. Spot bookings to pulling off a better response.</p>
      <p>Kolkata too, finally shows some oranges (filling fast shows) here and there, while Chennai is terrific with <b>40-45%</b> shows running to a good occupancy in advance booking.</p>
