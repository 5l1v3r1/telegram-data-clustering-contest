      <p>Céline Dion paid a visit to Jimmy Fallon on “The Tonight Show” on Friday to promote her new album <i>Courage</i> and first tour in more than a decade.</p>
      <p>During their chat, the 51-year-old Canadian chanteuse made a surprising revelation: she’s never taken a selfie.</p>
      <p>Fallon remedied that, grabbing his phone and posing with Dion, who warned, “I don’t want to have crooked eyes!”</p>

      <p>However, what she didn’t realize was that Fallon was actually taking a video with a silly “sunglasses” filter, with the resulting video earning a thumbs-down from the singer.</p>

      <p>Earlier in the interview, Fallon asked about her iconic hit “My Heart Will Go On” from “Titanic”, leading Dion to weigh in on the never-ending debate on whether Rose (Kate Winslet) could have saved Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) from freezing to death if she had just scooted over and made room for him to climb on with her after the doomed ocean liner hit the iceberg.</p>

      <p>Dion was initially hesitant to share her opinion as Fallon displayed a photo of Rose lying atop the floating door “Don’t put me in trouble,” she warned Fallon. “What if they want to do a ‘Titanic’ number two?”</p>
      <p>“No!” insisted Fallon. “You can’t do a ‘Titanic’ number two.”</p>

      <p>Studying the photo, Dion offered her opinion.</p>
      <p>“First of all, if you look to the picture, Rose is maybe dead or totally frozen, and she’s not quite all there, okay?” Dion explained before deadpanning, “Second of all, he doesn’t need an invitation.”</p>
      <p>Celine Dion’s <i>Courage</i> dropped on Friday.</p>
