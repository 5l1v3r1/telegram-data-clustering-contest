      <p>The cinematic trailer revealed at ExileCon in Auckland showed off gorgeous worlds, great, polished new visuals and even beast transformations.</p>
      <p><i>Path of Exile 2</i> will come with a variety of changes, including a total visual overhaul for the game and new skill mechanisms. This includes an improved gem system that streamlines inventory by breaking out gem improvements into its own menu.</p>

      <p>At ExileCon, two of the new lands from <i>Path of Exile 2</i> were unveiled via a live demo, including a graveyard and a forest location known as The Hunting Grounds. The graveyard level was a grimy journey filled with roving skeletons and one impressive boss fight.</p>

      <p>The visuals looked absolutely stunning, and were filled with gothic charm. This level culminated in a bonkers boss fight with Lachlann of Endless Lament, a towering boss who exploded onto the scene with hard-hitting, earth-shattering attacks.</p>
      <p>From there, the live demo segued into The Hunting Grounds, an area filled with werewolves and mythical charm. Here is where the beast transformations were first revealed, and they look <i>awesome</i>. Exiles can change their form on their fly, and unleash killer moves in their beast forms.</p>
