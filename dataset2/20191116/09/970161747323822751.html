      <p>Leroy Sane’s team-mates are ‘increasingly convinced’ that the winger is in his final season at <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-city-fc/">Manchester City</a>.</p>
      <p>The German was the subject of two bids from <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/bayern-munich-fc/">Bayern Munich</a> last summer but his knee injury in August ended the Bavarians’ hopes of signing him.</p>
      <p>City’s initial diagnosis was that Sane would not return until late March, meaning he’d face a race against time to prove his fitness for Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>But there is now optimism at the club that the winger could return in February to boost the side’s title bid.</p>

      <p>Sane is a popular figure in the City dressing room but the Telegraph report that the squad feel his ‘head has been turned’ by Bayern and that it’s only a matter of time before he makes the move.</p>
      <p>The winger has 18 months remaining on his current deal and will be down to just a year left next summer, when Bayern hope to sign him for a reduced fee.</p>

      <p>It’s felt that the 22-year-old is keen on a return to Germany and City are already said to be looking at replacements.</p>
      <p>Real Sociedad’s Mikel Oyarzabal is believed to be the frontrunner and has admirers on City’s board, such as director of football Txiki Begiristain.</p>
