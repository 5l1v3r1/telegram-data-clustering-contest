      <p>Chicago, IL – Lil Reese is evidently on the mend. Days after being <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53440/title.lil-reese-reportedly-in-critical-condition-following-shooting">shot in the neck,</a> the 26-year-old Chicago native resurfaced on Instagram Live, although his face was mostly covered up by a hoodie.</p>
      <p>In the clip, he appears to be sitting in a car and listening to some R&amp;B. However, he doesn’t say a word.</p>
