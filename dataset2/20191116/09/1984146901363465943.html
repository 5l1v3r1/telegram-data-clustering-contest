      <h1>Benefits claimants being asked to pay more than £1,000 to have their interviews recorded</h1>
      <h2>Labour's Frank Field - who is hoping to retain the Birkenhead seat in Parliament - said the DWP has told claimants they must bring specialist equipment if they want their interviews recorded</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T09:05:06+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 09:05</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Thorp, Will Metcalfe</a></address>
      <p>Disabled people are being forced to shell out more than £1,000 for state-of-the-art recording equipment by the DWP, a <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> candidate has revealed.</p>
      <p>Frank Field, who is hoping to be retain his Birkenhead seat, says many are missing out because sickness and disability assessments are not recorded.</p>
      <p>This means they are unable to prove what they said has been misinterpreted, he said.</p>
      <p>At present, those who want an audio recording of a benefits assessment interview need to actively request it,  <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/disabled-benefit-claimants-forced-fork-17251968">the Liverpool Echo reports</a>  .</p>
      <p>Mr Field said people applying for Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) or the sickness component of Universal Credit can request meetings are recorded - but this requires specialist equipment.</p>
      <p>The DWP insists it must be done on a NEAL CD Interview Recorder, which are most commonly used by the police to record interviews.</p>
      <p>However, the DWP has not bought enough machines to go around, and not all claimants are able to have their interview recorded.</p>
      <p>But the situation for Personal Independence Payment (PIP) applicants is even more stringent.</p>
      <p>Mr Field, who is the chair of the Work and Pensions Parliamentary committee, explained how individuals can request that their interview be recorded, however, they must provide the equipment themselves.</p>
      <p>He said the Neal CD Interview Recorder 9102 used by the DWP retails at £1,400+VAT.</p>

      <p>He said the Neal CD Interview Recorder 9102 used by the DWP retails at £1,400+VAT.</p>
      <p>This was the case with Liverpool man Stephen Smith, who was repeatedly and wrongly denied benefits but managed to overturn the decisions at tribunal.</p>
      <p>Sadly he died before his money was paid back.</p>
      <p>Mr Field said: "These prohibitive rules have left people frantically scratching around to find equipment that satisfies the Department.</p>
      <p>"There is now a flourishing second hand market for NEAL machines, with sellers expressly pointing out that these machines were used for PIP assessments.</p>
      <p>"Of all the issues I am contacted about in the course of my work, from constituents and the wider public, 'The DWP told lies on my assessment report' is the most common refrain.</p>
      <p>"The great majority of tribunal appeals are made and upheld on this basis, at great expense to the public purse. I believe that it makes sense that every interview should be 'On the Record', and that is why I have arranged for charity Involve Northwest to be provided with a NEAL Interview Recorder which it can loan to claimants."</p>
      <p>Responding, a DWP spokesperson said: “PIP assessments can be recorded, with equipment provided by the claimant, however we ask that claimants request any recording of a Work Capability Assessment before an appointment.”</p>
