      <h2>The shocking truth only emerged after the baby was born and a DNA test revealed the father was Quaser Abas, 37, who has been sentenced to 12 years in prison - but he said test was 'contaminated'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T09:20:10+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 09:20</time> by <a rel="author">Sophie Corcoran</a></address>
      <p>A teenager was forced to give birth to her rapist's baby, after going for a routine hospital check and finding out she was 23 weeks pregnant.</p>
      <p>The shocking truth was only revealed after the baby was born, and a DNA test proved that the father was Quaser Abas, 37.</p>
      <p>Evil Abas was found guilty of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/rape">rape</a> following a five-day trial at Hull Crown Court.</p>
      <p>He has been sentenced to 12 years in prison, reports <a href="https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/news/hull-east-yorkshire-news/quaser-abas-raped-hull-teenager-3544330">Hull Live</a>.</p>
      <p>The court heard how the girl, who was abused over a short period of time, went for a routine hospital check and discovered she was pregnant.</p>
      <p>Abas claimed that the subsequent DNA test, which revealed that the child was his, had been "contaminated".</p>
      <p>He also claimed the testimonies given by the girl and her mother during police interviews were "fabricated and concocted."</p>
      <p>Prosecuting, Mark McKone read out a victim statement from the girl, who said Abas has "destroyed her life".</p>
      <p>She said: "I didn't want a baby at this age, I didn't want it to happen the way it did.</p>
      <p>"I was scared to tell my mum.</p>
      <p>"When I found out I was pregnant I was shocked and scared to tell anyone and was scared about what they might say and think. I didn't want the baby but now it is here I wouldn't change it for the world.</p>
      <p>"I get upset having to think about it."</p>

      <p>The girl found she was pregnant at 23 weeks. NHS say most guidelines should be carried out before 24 weeks of pregnancy.</p>
      <p>But in exceptional circumstances an abortion can take place after 24 weeks – for example, if there's a risk to life or there are problems with the baby's development.</p>
      <p>The girl said she is glad she spoke out so Abas could not do the same to anyone else.</p>
      <p>Mr McKone also read out a statement from the girl's mother, who said she was scared that she would resent the baby.</p>
      <p>She said: "I can't speak to her about it or speak about what happened. I thought she was safe.</p>
      <p>"I can never get over it and need to ask why he did it.</p>
      <p>"It would have been hard enough for her to have a child, never mind at this age. He has taken her childhood away from her. She has had to grow up so fast.</p>
      <p>"I was there during the birth and it was so horrible watching her go through that, knowing I couldn't do anything.</p>
      <p>"He's destroyed our family.</p>
      <p>"One day we will have to tell the child what happened. I try not to think about it because when I do I feel like I'm going to cry and I love my grandchild now it's here but I can't think about it because I would resent it.</p>
      <p>"I didn't want to be a grandmother in these circumstances."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/court-case">The court</a> was told there could still be a chance for Abas to have a relationship with the baby.</p>
      <p>Judge David Tremberg told the jury that in the future he could apply for contact, and that would be the decision of the family court rather than the criminal courts.</p>
      <p>He said: "If there ever comes a time where it wants to know its father, it is not for me to shut that down.</p>
      <p>"There are family procedures that can deal with that issue. It may well be that it [the child] may never see its father but it is not for me or this court to deal with it."</p>
      <p>The court was told by Matthew Burden, acting on behalf of the defence, that Abas was of "previous good character."</p>
      <p>Sentencing him to 12 years imprisonment, Judge Tremberg said Abas claimed the crimes were "fabricated and concocted" by the girl and her mother.</p>

      <p>He said:  "You took the opportunity to rape her, having full, unprotected sexual intercourse. She told you 'no' but you pressed on and she simply submitted.</p>
      <p>"In her police interview she said she had 'no words' and was 'so scared'. This immature, inexperienced girl did nothing to show sexual interest in you but you took the opportunity to use her to vent your sexual energy."</p>
      <p>The court heard the girl did not report Abas at the time but soon faced a "different dilemma."</p>
      <p>Judge Tremberg: "Matters came to light because when a visit to hospital and a routine test was carried out it turned out she was 23 weeks pregnant.</p>
      <p>"Having had her child, the DNA that you were its father was overwhelming but you continued to protest your innocence instead of showing remorse, running your case that she had somehow fabricated it and the DNA must have been contaminated. You took to the witness box under oath.</p>
      <p>"The harm you caused was serious. She wouldn't have chosen to have a baby, especially to you, and confronted with the decision of what to do she decided to keep the child and that has changed the path of her life.</p>
      <p>"At some stage, the child will have to be told something of its parentage and there is no easy answer about what will be told or how it will deal with it when it is.</p>
      <p>"It is unlikely they will have anything like a normal relationship with its father after what you have done."</p>
      <p>He said Abas was a "serious sex offender" and said there will be no likelihood that he will "ever, ever have the opportunity to be in a similar situation again".</p>
      <p>Abas was will serve half of his sentence in prison and half on licence in the community.</p>
      <p>He has been made subject to a restraining order against the victim and handed a sexual harm prevention order for life which means he cannot have any unsupervised contact with female children under the age of 16.</p>
      <p>He must also be on the sex offender's register for life.</p>
