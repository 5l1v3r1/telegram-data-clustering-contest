      <p>Edouard is desperate to make the squad for Japan — but that would rule him out of key qualifiers.</p>
      <p>Celts will begin their Champions League or Europa League bid between July 7 and 9 and face eight games in eight weeks.</p>
      <p>If France go all the way to the final, Edouard would miss at least five of the Hoops’ qualifiers.</p>
      <p>And Celtic chiefs would have to bring him back without any break if he was to take part in the final three.</p>
      <p>But the in-form striker insists he’s determined to play a leading role in Sylvain Ripoll’s squad in the Far East next summer.</p>
      <p>He said: “It’s a very important competition, one that every sportsman dreams of participating in.</p>
      <p>“I have waited a long time to be called up by France at this level and I am keen to do well so I make an impression.”</p>
      <p>Edouard has impressed French Under-21s chief Ripoll with his prolific form for club and country.</p>
      <p>He said: “Odsonne is very efficient for Celtic and he has shown the same sharpness with us.”</p>
