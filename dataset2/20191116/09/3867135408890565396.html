      <h2>The Knights took the first 2 sets before Chelan came roaring back for the victory.</h2>

      <p>The King’s High School volleyball team needed only one more set victory to secure its third state championship and first since 2009, but Chelan didn’t back down after falling behind 2-0.</p>
      <p>The Goats rallied for three straight set victories to earn a 25-27, 16-25, 25-22, 25-21, 17-15 win in the Class 1A state-championship game Saturday at the Yakima Valley SunDome.</p>
      <p>The Knights cruised through the first three rounds state tournament on their way to the title match, sweeping all three contests on their way.</p>
      <p>King’s had a chance to complete a perfect run through the tournament after grabbing a 2-0 set advantage over Chelan (20-0), but the Goats battled back to eventually claim their second state title in a fifth set that went to extra points.</p>
      <p>The loss was the first of the season for the Knights (20-1), who placed at the state tournament for the second straight year.</p>
      <p>Entering the match, King’s hadn’t dropped a set to a 1A opponent all season long and had taken 60 of 64 sets in 20 games played against squads from across all classifications, which included wins over 4A Skyline and North Creek and 3A Lakeside.</p>
