      <p>Olivia Colman has hailed actor Gillian Anderson, who will be portraying British Prime Minister <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/margaret-thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> in the fourth season of Netflix’s The Crown, saying she is a fun person to work with.</p>
      <p>Colman, who takes on the role of Queen <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/elizabeth-ii">Elizabeth II</a> in the show’s third season, said Anderson is absolutely brilliant, something that the audiences will also agree with when they see it.</p>
      <p>“She’s amazing. The moment she opened her mouth in the read-through, you could feel everyone wanting to do a little silent ‘Yay!’ Because she was so brilliant,” the Oscar winner said.</p>
      <p>The fourth season of The Crown will move into the 1970s, where Thatcher served as Britain’s first female Prime Minister between 1979 to 1990.</p>
      <p>Colman said the show gave her a historical feel when she started working on it but that is not the case anymore.</p>
      <p>“It’s interesting because, series three, for me, was like doing a historical piece. Now, it feels less like that and more, I remember that. I remember that voice. I remember that moment. It feels quite different. We had our read-through and to hear the voices of Margaret Thatcher and all of that, it’s quite fun” she added.</p>
      <p>The third season of The Crown, which will also feature Tobias Menzies as Prince Philip and Helena Bonham Carter as Princess Margaret, will debut on Netflix on November 17.</p>
