      <p>A student was hit by a car just two weeks after avoiding jail for trolling <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/aston-villa-fc/">Aston Villa</a> footballer Jack Grealish over the death of his baby brother.</p>
      <p>Alfie Perkins, 19, was left with a fractured skull when a car allegedly failed to stop at a red light while driving at speed.</p>
      <p>He shared photographs of his bloodied face and scarred body following the incident on November 2.</p>
      <p>Writing on Twitter, Perkins said: ‘Life comes at you nearly as fast as speeding cars that don’t stop on red lights do’.</p>
      <p>He added: ‘Didn’t think it was possible for me to get any uglier but here we are with my face drooping to the right and the left side of it not working, you not reckon it’s time I caught a break’.</p>
      <p>However, he denied suggestions the incident was ‘karma’ for trolling the football star after that was suggested by another twitter user.</p>

      <p>Perkins replied: ‘Leg it bruv, karma for laughing at somebody being dead is not fracturing your skull in two places hahaha’.</p>

      <p>Earlier this year, Perkins downed nine pints of lager before watching Birmingham City vs Aston Villa derby</p>
      <p>He then sent Grealish, who scored the winning goal, three horrific messages about his baby brother Keelan.</p>
      <p>On one tweet, Perkins included a picture of Keelan’s gravestone.</p>
      <p>He tweeted: ‘He may have scored but will never bring his dead brother back and that brings me more satisfaction than anything else ever could.’</p>
      <p>Another tweet said: ‘Grealish went down quicker than his brother got lowered into the grave. Where’s your brother gone? Come on!’</p>

      <p>Keelan fell victim to cot death in April 2000, aged just nine months old. Grealish was aged four at the time.</p>
      <p>Perkins, an accountancy and finance student, was ordered to pay a fine and was seen smirking outside of court following the trial.</p>
      <p>When questioned about his smiles outside of court, Perkins tweeted: ‘I regret all of it but she says this like nobody would be smiling after being faced with the prospect of prison and the end result being only having to pay £350. Wallop.’</p>
      <p>Perkins denied the charges against him and claimed that he was encouraged to post the tweets by those with him at the game.</p>
