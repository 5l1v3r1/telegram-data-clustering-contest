      <h1>BBC Apprentice star Alan Sugar blasts contestant over 'horrible tattoos'</h1>
      <h2>WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS "When you're 50 on the beach you'll wear a T shirt. You will be an embarrassment to your kids"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T09:21:04+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 09:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/max-clements/" target="_blank">Max Clements</a></address>
      <p>A heated twitter row erupted between <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/tv">Apprentice</a> host Lord Sugar and one of the shows contestants over his chest tattoos.</p>
      <p>This week the candidates were set the task of launching and advertising campaign rebranding Finland.</p>
      <p>For the advert, contestant Lewis Ellis was pictured with his top off revealing his chest tattoos- much to the dislike of Lord Sugar.</p>
      <p>While this week's <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/tv">episode was on air</a> , the businessman was tweeting along and he did not take kindly to Lewis' tattoos.</p>
      <p>In a tweet on Wednesday night, Lord Sugar said: "Lewis your tattoos are horrific. Tell me where I am missing the point. What does he look like?"</p>
      <p>Lewis immediately replied back with: "Wow LAS how could you do me like this @Lord_Sugar."</p>

      <p>"Thank you everyone that took the time to show some support for my horrific tattoos and pointing out no one has the right to judge you or your body."</p>
      <p>But that was far from the end of the matter as on Friday evening Lord Sugar again attacked the contestant's body art in a reply to a photo he posted on twitter.</p>
      <p>The host of the hit BBC show wouldn't let the argument end there and he again voiced his dislike of Lewis' body art.</p>

      <p>Lord Sugar said: "Lewis your tattoos tell your story. What are you a Kindle?</p>
      <p>"You have the right to do what you want with your body. I have the right of an opinion. I say that they are horrible.</p>

      <p>Yes No</p>
      <p>"When you're 50 on the beach you'll wear a T shirt.</p>
      <p>"You will be an embarrassment to your kids."</p>
      <p> The digital marketer from Manchester hit back with a simple response. </p>
      <p>Lewis tweeted: "Ok Boomer."</p>

      <p>This phrase is a viral reference used to troll attitudes that are stereotypically held by the older 'baby boomer' generation.</p>
      <p>The photo shared by the contestant shows Lewis with a tattoo on his chest and arms that are usually well hidden under his smart business attire.</p>
      <p>The tattoos on his chest show a man walking between two paths, a ferris wheel one one side, cogs on the other - that he says represent "never conforming, not being the same as everyone else and never being part of the machine."</p>
      <p>Lewis has previously admitted that the tattoos as "cheesy, but I love them".</p>
