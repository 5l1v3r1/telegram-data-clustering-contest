        <b>Manchester United are ready to fork out £200m to land two attacking stars in January, while Bobby Duncan has revealed the real reason for leaving Liverpool – all in Friday’s papers.</b>

      <h3>UNITED PLANNING £200M DOUBLE RAID</h3>
      <p>Manchester United are reportedly weighing up a £200m double January transfer swoop for <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/tag/jadon-sancho"><b>Jadon Sancho</b></a> and <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/tag/erling-braut-haaland"><b>Erling-Braut Haaland</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has identified the 19-year-old duo as his priority targets, with United ready to move swiftly when the window re-opens, to try to land them ahead of their rivals, according to the <i>Daily Mirror</i>.</p>
      <p>Both are likely to cost United close to £200million, with Borussia Dortmund and England winger Sancho valued at £100m and RB Salzburg and Norway frontman Haaland at £85m.</p>
      <p>Sancho is currently having a difficult time at Dortmund, with United alerted to his potential availability in January, rather than next summer, when they had planned to move for him.</p>

      <p>As for Haaland, United hope his relationship with Solskjaer, who managed him at Molde, can give them a head start over their rivals in the race to sign one of Europe’s most prolific young strikers.</p>
      <p>Haaland, son of former City and Leeds midfielder Alf-Inge, has already scored 22 goals in 16 appearances this season – including seven in the Champions League.</p>
      <p>United have had Haaland watched several times this season, with Solskjaer sending one of his senior scouts, Simon Wells, to assess the youngster in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>If United were successful in their pursuit of Haaland, one option would be to loan him back to RB Salzburg for the remainder of the season, delaying his permanent move until next summer.</p>
