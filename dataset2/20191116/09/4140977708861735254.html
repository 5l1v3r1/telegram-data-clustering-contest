                      <p>Once in the opposition half, he then embarrassed former Barcelona teammate Philippe Coutinho with a nice bit of skill, where it can be seen that Coutinho was chasing Messi but the Argentine International’s acceleration was too much for him.</p>

                            <p>Messi completely fooled Coutinho with a quick change of direction and even picked out a teammate with his through ball. Meanwhile, local fans were excited to see the Latin footballers fancying their skills.</p>
                            <p>But overall the game was below par and saw two missed penalties, as both Gabriel Jesus and Messi missed the spot-kick, although the latter was able to score on the rebound, which was the only goal in the game.</p>
                            <p>This is the second time when Jesus has missed a penalty in a similar fashion, the first time it was against Atlanta in the Champions League game.</p>
