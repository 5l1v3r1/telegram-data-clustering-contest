      <p>And now <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/2447247/scottish-athlete-lynsey-sharp-bikini-shot-australian-beach-commonwealth-games/">Lynsey</a> is urging other women to get their own smear tests done.</p>
      <p>Taking to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B40WAhHJZ1g/">Instagram</a>, the athlete said: "The last few weeks have been a bit rough.</p>
      <p>"Last week I had surgery to remove cells which came back today as pre cancerous. A smear test, lead to a biopsy which lead to surgery.</p>
      <p>"I have to take it easy for a few weeks but I’m getting there and...health takes precedence.</p>
      <p>"If I hadn’t gone for a smear test I wouldn’t have been able to catch this before it developed any further. Please please please go and get a smear test...it takes 5 minutes.</p>
      <p>"If sharing this encourages even one of you ladies to go then it will be worth sharing."</p>

      <p>It comes after we reported how <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/fabulous/4922916/endometriosis-glasgow-student-diagnosed-smear-test/">one Glasgow student</a> was diagnosed with endometriosis by chance after her first smear test despite years of chronic pain.</p>
      <p>Kayleigh Dwyer told how she spent six years thinking she was just being a "drama queen" about her period.</p>
      <p>She was finally diagnosed with endo when she went for her first smear test aged 21.</p>
