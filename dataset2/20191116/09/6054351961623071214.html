      <h1>Naturi Naughton Clap Backs At 50 Cent's Mortal Kombat Meme</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T09:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://hiphopdx.com/author/paul.dachs" target="_blank">Paul Dachs</a></address>
      <p>Naturi Naughton is done with 50 cent’s shade. The <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.52665/title.50-cent-reminds-fans-power-has-a-spin-off-stop-saying-this-is-the-last-season"><i>Power </i></a>actress and movie star responded to Fiddy’s latest troll with a jab of her own, pointing out his apparent Instagram timeout.</p>
      <p>In an Instagram post that shared her original response to 50’s reaction-garnering tweet, Naughton said, “there’s so much I wanna say but… you don’t even have an Instagram account so… why waste my characters or come out of my CHARACTER!”</p>

      <p>50’s post features the Mortal Kombat character ‘Goro’, and is clearly intended to make fun of Naughton’s hairline. The tweet – which is just the latest in a long line of <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53463/title.50-cent-tweets-absolute-randomness-after-instagram-account-gets-shut-down">social media trolls</a> by the <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.52665/title.50-cent-reminds-fans-power-has-a-spin-off-stop-saying-this-is-the-last-season">Power</a> executive producer – received serious backlash from fans.</p>

      <p>The rapper and mogul has recently found himself without an Instagram account, after presumably <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53463/title.50-cent-tweets-absolute-randomness-after-instagram-account-gets-shut-down">violating the social media site’s policies.</a></p>
      <p>Many showed their support for Naughton, emphasizing her natural beauty and status as a successful black woman. Actress Bresha Webb, known for her role in <i>Love That Girl!, </i>commented, “Yes you are! This is so dumb!”</p>
      <p>Despite the diss, Naughton also appeared to take the opportunity to throw in some promotion for her upcoming book, which may be titled ‘What Not To Do When You’re A Boss.’ She writes, ‘But do pick up a copy of my upcoming book: #whatNOTtoDoWhenYoureABoss.</p>
      <p>It’s not clear, however, whether this might be another shot at Fifty, who’s perceived as the ‘boss’ at <i>Power</i>, as well as being a published author.</p>
