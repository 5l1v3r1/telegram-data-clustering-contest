        <b>A DAD was left 'terrified' when armed police stormed his home after a child's toy was mistaken for a gun.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Cops flooded the street in Crieff, Perthshire, following reports James Kilgore had been seen brandishing a firearm inside the property.</p>

      <p>The 49-year-old was too afraid to open the door because he feared he was going to get shot by police dressed in riot gear and carrying weapons.</p>
      <p>Witnesses said a number of police vehicles, including several armed response units, vans and squad cars descended on the quiet neighbourhood at about 7am.</p>
      <p>Officers were responding to reports that the father been seen at the living room window of his first-floor flat holding a gun and making a shooting motion.</p>
      <p>Mr Kilgore said: “I was just cleaning my windows - I don’t know why people thought I had a gun."</p>
      <p>“The next thing I knew, the street was full of police.</p>
      <p>"There must have been every officer in Tayside at my door.</p>
      <p>"They were filling into the street from all directions.”</p>
      <p>“They asked me about a gun and I told them the only gun I had was a child’s toy in the kitchen drawer."</p>
      <p>“It looks like a water pistol. I think one of the neighbours had maybe seen one of the kids playing with it outside and thought we had a real gun."</p>
      <p>The stunned father-of-four was led away by officers shortly before 9am but was later released without charge pending further inquiries.</p>
      <p>Mr Kilgore added: “I’ve never had a machine gun pointed at me before and it’s not something I’d want to happen again."</p>
      <p>It is understood a number of local residents have previously raised concerns about incidents at the Mr Kilgore's address.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>One neighbour, who said he was left shaken by the police operation on Wednesday, confirmed he had raised the matter directly with Hillcrest Housing Association.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for the organisation said it is "aware of the ongoing issues".</p>
      <p>"Police attended and later confirmed it was a broken BB gun which was seized," she said.</p>
      <p>"The area outside the property was also searched and nothing criminal was found.</p>
      <p>"A male was arrested at the scene but was later released without charge.</p>
      <p>"In the light of this event we are not taking further action as the individual has not been charged with an offence.</p>
      <p>"If tenants have concerns about the behaviour of their neighbours, we would always encourage them to report this to the police and to us as their landlord."</p>
      <p>Police Scotland confirmed officers attended a property on Sauchie Terrace in Crieff after a report of a disturbance at around 7.15am on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>A spokesman said: "There is not considered to have been any risk to the wider community and local residents are thanked for their patience while the incident was resolved.”</p>
