      <h1>Tesco issues warning to shoppers over dangerous new scam on social media</h1>
      <h2>A new scam is sweeping across social media</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T09:50:05+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 09:50</time> by <a rel="author">James Andrew, Sophie Barley</a></address>
      <p>This year Tesco turned 100 and to celebrate the chain launched a string of discounts.</p>
      <p>However it did not do was launch a voucher giveaway on Facebook to celebrate - but that's exactly what scammers are claiming on Facebook.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/tesco">Tesco</a> spokeswoman told <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/tesco-warns-customers-dangerous-new-20888612">Mirror Money</a> : “This is not a Tesco offer. We would always ask customers to be vigilant and to double check the legitimacy of any online coupons, vouchers or competitions.</p>
      <p>"If you are ever unsure about coupons/vouchers you see online you can always check by calling our customer service team on 0800 50 55 55.</p>
      <p>"Customers can also visit our privacy centre, where we have some advice regarding staying safe online and how to be aware of scams and phishing.”</p>
      <p>Worryingly, the last time this sort of scam hit <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> in 2017, Tesco shoppers were far from the only ones targeted.</p>
      <p>Fake vouchers started circulating for Sainsbury's, Asda, Waitrose, Iceland, Argos, John Lewis and Morrisons too.</p>
      <p>An Action Fraud spokesman told Mirror Money customers should be wary before clicking on an unsolicited links.</p>

      <p>"Fraudsters will do everything they can to try and take personal and financial details from their victims. It is extremely tempting to click on links for vouchers whilst browsing on social media," a spokesperson said.</p>
      <p>"However we ask people to be wary of clicking on unsolicited links and advise that they do their research first, before giving away any personal or financial details.”</p>
