      <p>Akshay Kumar’s recent injury on the sets of ‘Sooryavanshi’ caused extra concern as the actor was spotted at Hinduja Hospital in Mumbai. However, recent reports suggest that Kumar had gone to the hospital not to seek medical assistance, but to visit his mother-in-law Dimple Kapadia.</p>
      <p>“Akshay had sprained his left arm while shooting which is why his visit raised many eyebrows. Upon making further inquiries, we realised that Dimple Kapadia has been keeping unwell and hence Akshay had made a quick visit to inquire about her well-being,” a source told<i> Deccan Chronicle</i>. It is unclear why Kapadia has been admitted to the hospital.</p>
      <p>Kumar’s injury has not created any delays in the shooting of ‘Sooryavanshi’, which will release on ‎27 March, 2020.</p>
