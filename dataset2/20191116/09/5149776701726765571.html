      <p>Platforms are to be installed to give walkers stunning aerial views of Gedling Country Park.</p>
      <p>Two are planned as part of a £120,000 investment.</p>
      <p>They will be positioned north and south of the solar panel farm at the park - and one of the platforms will be four metres high.</p>
      <p>They will both feature wheelchair and pushchair accessible ramps and panels with information about the views beyond, such as Lincoln Cathedral and Belvoir Castle, Grantham.</p>

      <p>Work is due to start later this year and the platforms are expected to be ready for visitors by March 2020.</p>
      <p>The funding was awarded by the Rural Payments Agency, which provides grants for projects helping to promote growth, jobs and tourism in rural areas.</p>

      <p>Since opening in March 2015, the park has become increasingly popular, with around 100,000 visitors per year.</p>
      <p>There are also plans in the pipeline for a <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/plans-expand-car-park-spaces-3491950">100-space car park to the north of the existing visitor centre</a>.</p>
      <p>And a pet-friendly outdoor seating area <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/plans-revealed-pet-friendly-outdoor-3269660">could also be built outside a café at the park</a>.</p>
