      <h2>Comedian David Baddiel took to the stage in front of more than 1,200 children in Wolverhampton as part of a special event.</h2>

      <p>The author visited the city's Grand Theatre to chat to youngsters about his life as an author and the famous Three Lions song.</p>
      <p>The 55-year-old, in an interview with the Express &amp; Star, said it was great to visit the city – and apologised for missing it out on next year's tour.</p>
      <p>He said: "I've been in the Grand Theatre before but I've not had the chance to hang out in Wolverhampton.</p>
      <p>"I'm touring next year but I'm not playing Wolverhampton – I think it's a real mistake, but I'm still doing stuff in the Midlands."</p>
      <p>The comedian, famous for his partnership with Frank Skinner, said: "I was doing a warm-up gig in Stretton at 10.30pm and from there I was driven to Wolverhampton and stayed in the Mount Hotel.</p>
      <p>"I got in at 1.30am and was up at 8am to entertain 1,200 children.</p>
      <p>"It's been great, but it's been a packed day."</p>
      <h3>Amazing</h3>
      <p>Children from across the city turned out as part of the event held by Wolverhampton Grammar School, which aims to boost literacy levels and help youngsters read more.</p>
      <p>Mr Baddiel added: "They've all been amazing and it was a great event.</p>
      <p>"What Wolverhampton Grammar School have done is they've brought in their kids and others from all areas.</p>
      <p>"I think that's really important and I quite like performing on the stage, rather than an assembly hall, too.</p>
      <p>"They asked lots of detailed questions about writing, and if football's coming home – and I asked them questions as well.</p>
      <p>"I asked them what they would invent and it did get a bit political – they said they would invent something to destroy Boris Johnson and Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>"I thought I had to diffuse that and say 'how about shutting them up instead'?</p>
      <p>"But it was really good overall."</p>
      <p>It came as the comedian launched his new book, The Taylor Turbochaser, with all pupils being given a free copy.</p>
