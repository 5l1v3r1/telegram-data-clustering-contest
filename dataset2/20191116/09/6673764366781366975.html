      <p>Raiden is often mentioned as the greatest rikishi never to reach yokozuna.</p>
      <p>Back when the Edo Period legend was dominating in the ring however, ozeki was the highest rank on the banzuke, with yokozuna still being an honorary title.</p>
      <p>There are many theories as to why it wasn’t awarded to Raiden but none have anything to do with his feats on the clay.</p>
      <p>In more modern times, however, there is one name that stands above all others when discussing who is the best wrestler never to make grand champion.</p>
      <p>Ozeki Kaio lifted the Emperor’s Cup five times in a record setting 23-year career. That’s equal to — or more than — the number of championships won by 11 different yokozuna promoted since the initiation of the six-tournaments-a-year system.</p>
      <p>With 11 runner-up finishes as well in the space of eight years, Kaio would likely have been promoted to sumo’s highest rank had he competed in a different era, but unfortunately for the Tomozuna stable man he was active at a time when the guidelines were more strictly applied.</p>
      <p>Although he never earned promotion to yokozuna, Kaio holds the longevity records at ozeki and is also No. 2 all time in both career and top-division wins — second only to modern titan Hakuho.</p>
      <p>Kaio was part of probably the greatest recruiting class of all time as he made his debut alongside three future yokozuna.</p>
      <p>Between them, Kaio, Akebono, Takanohana and Wakanohana won 43 Emperor’s Cups and ruled sumo during the 1990s.</p>
      <p>Kaio outlasted his illustrious classmates by about a decade though and was still competing long after both Akebono and Wakanohana had left sumo entirely.</p>
      <p>The ozeki’s most fearsome weapon was an armlock throw — a move that generated so much torque that it often led to injuries to opponents’ elbows.</p>
      <p>Kaio is now a sumo elder and head of Asakayama stable.</p>
