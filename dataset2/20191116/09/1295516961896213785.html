      <h1>Sonic Creator Yuji Naka Has an Idea for the Fan-Hated Scrapped Design</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T09:11:49+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 09:11</time> by <a rel="author">Adreon Patterson</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/sonic-the-hedgehog-movie/">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> creator Yuji Naka gave his unique take on the title character's redesign for his upcoming live-action film.</p>
      <p>Naka unleashed <a href="https://twitter.com/nakayuji?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1194242281508753408&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dualshockers.com%2Fyuji-naka-comments-new-sonic-movie-redesign%2F">a series of tweets</a> expressing his desire to see the old design in tandem with the new design. The former Sonic Team leader wrote about the new film poster, “Sonic’s new design for the movie is out. However, it seems they’re making it as if the old design didn’t exist, as the movie official account’s old tweets were deleted. I wanted to see a special DVD version of the movie which used the old design. Too bad.”</p>

      <p>After he spoke on the poster, Naka elaborated more on his opinion about the film's new trailer. “This is the new trailer with Sonic’s new design. The design is much more Sonic-like now that he’s wearing gloves," he added. "However, his eyes still aren’t joined together, as expected. I can’t help but feel weird about that one point. But I’m looking forward to the movie’s release.”</p>
