      <p>Kashiwa Reysol proved for the third time they are a hard team to keep down after clinching the J. League’s second-division championship and earning promotion to J1 on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Reysol, relegated to the J2 this year, booked their first division return in one season, just as they had in 2006 and 2010. Reysol sealed the deal with a 3-0 win at Machida Zelvia on a brace by Brazilian striker Cristiano and a second-minute opener by Yusuke Segawa.</p>
      <p>The last time Reysol won J2, the Chiba Prefecture side followed it by winning the J. League championship in 2011 in a season thrown into turmoil by the March 11 earthquake and tsunami.</p>
      <p>Kashiwa went on to win the 2012 Emperor’s Cup and 2013 J. League Yamazaki Nabisco Cup in addition to reaching the semifinals of the 2013 Asian Champions League.</p>
      <p>Yokohama FC moved closer toward earning a stint in J1 with a 1-0 victory at Fagiano Okayama. They were formed by Yokohama Flugels fans after their team was absorbed by rival side Yokohama Marinos at the end of the 1998 season.</p>
      <p>Yokohama FC are second, two points ahead of third-place Omiya Ardija, and can clinch promotion with a win next week at home against Ehime.</p>
      <p>The top two J2 teams earn automatic promotion to the top flight, while those finishing third to sixth will compete to face the J1’s 16th-place team in a promotion-relegation playoff.</p>
      <p>After Ardija, Montedio Yamagata (70 points), Ventforet Kofu (68) and Kyoto Sanga (68) occupy the remaining playoff-eligible spots.</p>
