      <p>About a week ago, <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/nokia">Nokia</a> and Flipkart announced that they are collaborating to bring Nokia-branded smart TVs to the Indian market. At the time, there was no information about the Nokia TV. A few days back, there were reports that this TV has gotten the certification of the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). This certification shows that the Nokia TV will feature a 55-inch 4K UHD panel. According to a BIS certification, the Nokia smart TV comes with model number 55CAUHDN. Now, the latest report suggests that this TV will arrive in India in December this year.</p>

      <p>After Xiaomi, Jiajia, and Motorola, Nokia is the fourth mobile phone manufacturer to enter the smart TV market. Flipkart has established a partnership with Nokia, and in a statement, Flipkart will manufacture and sell Nokia smart TVs in India as part of the “Made in India” program. In addition, the company will create thousands of new jobs. </p>
      <p>What we know for now is that it will have a 55-inch display with 4K resolution. Furthermore, it uses JBL speakers and the Android 9 Pie operating system. In addition, this TV will also use “smart dimming technology”, which can provide better color display and restoration.</p>
