      <h1>Derby's high street 'one of the least thriving in the country'</h1>
      <h2>Retail closures have reached a five-year high nationwide</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T06:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Hayley Watson</a></address>
      <p>Derby's high street has been named one of the least thriving in the country, according to new research.</p>
      <p>As retail closures reach a five-year high nationwide, a new ranking by <a href="https://www.asktraders.co.uk/">AskTraders.co.uk </a>has revealed which high streets are the most and least thriving.</p>
      <p>Derby ranks number 17 on the list of least thriving high streets due to its high percentage of closures.</p>
      <p>Compared to the rest of the East Midlands, both Leicester and Nottingham ranked in the top 20 of the most thriving list.</p>
      <p>The website conducted in-depth analysis using open data from Link ATM, Which? and the Office for National Statistics which analysed ATM, retail store and bank closures in fifty of the largest cities and towns in the UK.</p>
      <p>It then looked at the percentage of new openings and retail growth in comparison.</p>

      <p>According to the study, during the first half of 2019, around 16 stores closed their doors every day - whilst only nine stores were opened.</p>
      <p>This resulted in a net decline of 1,234 chain stores across Britain’s high streets including <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/thomas-cook">East Midlands-founded travel giant Thomas Cook,</a> which collapsed in September.</p>
      <p>Steve Miley, senior market analyst at <a href="https://www.asktraders.com/">AskTraders</a>, said: "The UK high street has been weathering tough trading conditions with many UK retailers dropping by the wayside.</p>
      <p>"Traditional retail store closures are on the up as businesses grapple with a weak consumer in the face of Brexit uncertainty, the unabated rise of e-commerce, higher costs and changing tastes."</p>
      <p>He continued: "There are, inevitably, going to be winners and losers. High street retailers with inflexible business models that have failed to adapt to their changing environment are and will be the most noticeable casualties.</p>
      <p>"Big names have just vanished from our high street and there will certainly be more to come.</p>
      <p>"The challenges that the high street is facing aren’t going anywhere fast. This will be a case of survival of the fittest. Those retailers that can evolve whilst still giving their customers exactly what they want could have a lot to gain."</p>
