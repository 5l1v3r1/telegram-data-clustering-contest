      <p>The Telford Centre Christmas lights switch-on was promising a packed day of family entertainment before the illuminations go live at 5pm.</p>
      <p>The shopping centre entertainment was beginning at 11am and includes bouncing snowmen, glitter bells, stilt walkers, music, games, face-painting and balloon modelling.</p>
      <p>The actual switch on will be carried out by Father Christmas, who was also opening his official 'Santa's Sorting Office'.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Telford Centre explained that children would be able to go and send off their very own Christmas lists.</p>
      <p>He said: "We will have the opening of our Santa Sorting Office, on New Row by House of Fraser and opposite Costa Coffee.</p>
      <p>"It is a brand new, free and interactive experience for children with games and the opportunity to write their letter to Santa."</p>
