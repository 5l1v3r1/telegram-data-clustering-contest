      <p>Bangladesh openers Shadman Islam and Imrul Kayes recorded a pair of sixes in the first Test against India and not the good kind. Islam and Kayes got out after scoring six runs each in both the innings of the Test at Holkar Cricket Stadium, Indore. There were more coincidences as they were dismissed by the same bowlers on both occasions. <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/ishant-sharma/">Ishant Sharma</a> got rid of Islam whereas <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/umesh-yadav/">Umesh Yadav</a> dominated Kayes.</p>
      <p>The debutant opener even played the same number of deliveries in both the innings, six runs from 24 deliveries. The only difference being the one boundary scored by the 24-year-old in the second innings on Saturday.</p>

      <p>There was another six-run score registered by an opener in the first Test. Indian opener <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/rohit-sharma/">Rohit Sharma</a> scored six runs from 14 deliveries in the hosts’ first innings. Rohit lost his wicket to Abu Jayed, who picked up a four-wicket haul.</p>
      <p>Earlier on Day 3, Indian skipper <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/virat-kohli/">Virat Kohli</a> declared the first innings half an hour before the start of day’s play.</p>
      <p>Indian seamers dominated the first session as Bangladesh lost four wickets in the first session. <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/mohammed-shami/">Mohammed Shami</a> struck two wickets sending back Mominul Haque and Mohammad Mithun back to the dressing room cheaply.</p>
