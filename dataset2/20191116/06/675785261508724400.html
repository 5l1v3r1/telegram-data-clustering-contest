      <h1>Real Madrid eye Chelsea winger Callum Hudson-Odoi ahead of potential transfer move</h1>
      <h2>Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane and president Florentino Perez are admirers of Hudson-Odoi as well as Man Utd transfer target Erling Braut Haaland</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T06:06:36+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 06:06</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Real Madrid are weighing up a move for Chelsea youngster Callum Hudson-Odoi, according to latest reports from Spain.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/callum-hudson-odoi">Hudson-Odoi</a> was heavily linked with a move to Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich earlier this year before agreeing a new five-year contract at Stamford Bridge.</p>
      <p>But the 19-year-old's new deal has not stopped speculation surrounding the Chelsea winger, and he is reportedly on a list of four young targets being monitored by Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane and president Florentino Perez.</p>
      <p>Spanish publication <a href="https://eldesmarque.com/madrid/real-madrid/noticias/176065-cuatro-fichajes-tapados-de-florentino-perez-lee-lo-nombres-revolucion-en-el-real-madrid">El Desmarque</a> says both Zidane and Perez are admirers of England international Hudson-Odoi and are keeping tabs on the teenager ahead of a potential summer swoop.</p>
      <p>The La Liga giants are also tracking <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> target Erling Braut Haaland of Red Bull Salzburg, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> striker Moise Kean and Villarreal forward Samu Chikwueze.</p>

      <p>Hudson-Odoi is valued at Â£31.5million according to <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/callum-hudson-odoi/profil/spieler/392768">Transfermarkt</a> - although he is contracted to Chelsea until 2024 so there is no need for the club to sell.</p>
      <p>Hudson-Odoi revealed it only took one conversation with boss Frank Lampard to convince him to sign a new <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> deal, and insists he is pleased with his decision to snub Bayern Munich.</p>
      <p>"I can't say exactly what he said but he just said he believes in me," said Hudson-Odoi. "He wants me to work hard and if I believe in myself then he believes in me and things will go well for me at this club.</p>
      <p>"And he wants me to play for him. They were encouraging signs for me that you want to hear from a manager, that he believes in you and he has faith in you, that you can become a good player and achieve a lot of stuff at the club.</p>

      <p>"I was excited. It was exciting times that a new manager was coming in and also you know that he will play at least some of the youth boys as well.</p>
      <p>"So it's good to know that you are going to play with some of the players from before.</p>
      <p>"I said from the start that I made the right decision to stay at Chelsea. I've been there all my life. I've loved the club from day one."</p>
