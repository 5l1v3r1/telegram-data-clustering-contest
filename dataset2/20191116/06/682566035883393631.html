      <h1>Biff saga: Politburo 1 Cricket Public 0?</h1>

      <p>Cape Town - Whether one of South Africa’s most celebrated, gladiatorial on-field sons would have cut it as director of cricket in the crisis-torn CSA set-up will remain, at least for the time being, a matter for pure conjecture.</p>
      <p>That follows the revelation on Thursday by long-time national captain and opening batsman Graeme Smith that he has “withdrawn interest” in the newly-created post.</p>
      <p>The statement by the 38-year-old contained fairly expressive detail which would only have deepened a sense of disappointment - or more tangible anger and indignation in some cases? - among those in the cricket-watching public who advocated his presence in the capacity despite a lack of specialist prior experience.</p>
      <p>The widely-respected “Biff” - in a move hardly likely to see a rekindling of his claims with the deeply embattled umbrella body any time soon - spoke of a “frustrating process over the last 10 weeks or so of discussions” in which he had “not developed the necessary confidence that I would be given the level of freedom and support to initiate the required changes”.</p>
      <p>In relatively few words, he nevertheless seemed to say so much, conjuring up images of the big personality running into a brick wall of bureaucracy, and possibly self-importance and paranoia about any shakeup intentions on his part.</p>
      <p>It would only have been fuelled by the subsequent lament on Twitter by Michael Vaughan, captain of England’s iconic Ashes drought-breaking side of 2005 and a one-time bilateral head-to-head rival in leadership: <b><i>“Shame they couldn’t give you (Smith) a blank canvas to get on with the role ... you are exactly what SA cricket needs.”</i></b></p>
      <p>Social media has since been flooded with observations by cricket enthusiasts, both domestically and globally, overwhelmingly suggesting that CSA has blown a golden opportunity to get a truly heavyweight international legend involved at a lofty level.</p>
      <p>Instead, anticipate - rightly or wrongly - the blossoming of a belief that cricket in this country is led too lopsidedly by an autocratic politburo, and amidst a mounting pile of evidence suggesting an organisation dogged by infighting, factionalism, legal turmoil, callowness or an overload of “interim” status in key positions ... and a mushrooming financial crisis not helped by the hesitant start to the second edition of much-hoped-for Twenty20 panacea the Mzansi Super League.</p>
      <p>Against the backdrop of a perfect storm ominously continuing to brew, Smith will only have accelerated the tide of anti-CSA feeling through his withdrawal statement.</p>
      <p>It also comes at a time when, in contrastingly buoyant South African rugby circles after the stirring third Webb Ellis Cup success recently, a man from a heavily player-based background who would have effectively been a counterpart in “directorship” to Smith, Rassie Erasmus, is being lauded for his recipe toward the World Cup glory and associated contribution to a renewed sense of national unity and pride.</p>
      <p>While he steps down from the head coach position now, Erasmus, who played 36 times for the Springboks and had a 10-year first-class career as a dynamic loose forward, simply shifts more industriously into his already-existing role as director of rugby with the national body.</p>
      <p>In a purely cricketing achievement sense, Smith has an even broader pedigree with his length of Proteas service and weight of statistical achievement across the formats, although he would have begun a “desk” job on considerably more of a risky, fast track basis than Erasmus did.</p>
      <p>While charismatic ex-players carry no automatic guarantees of success in positions that require padding-up of considerably different kinds much of the time, Smith would have been seen by plenty of observers as a welcome balancer in the CSA corridors, coming from cricket’s truest, top-flight trenches.</p>
      <p>Whatever their own level of responsibility for Smith’s no-go decision, Cricket South Africa will widely be seen, in an already dangerous climate for them, to have cocked a snook at a Proteas hero, even as the process of filling the director’s position in a hurried time frame continues …</p>
