      <h2>Three months in and Arsenal’s 2019/20 season has not gone very well. However, that does not mean that everything should be doom and gloom. Here are three positives from the season thus far.</h2>

      <p>Well, if you had to ask <a href="https://paininthearsenal.com/?s=arsenal">Arsenal</a> fans for their worst-case scenario for the 2019/20 season, they would probably describe something similar to what has actually happened over the past three months. Little progress in Unai Emery’s second season, a lack of identity and imposing style, poor performances abounding, and now subpar results to boot. It would be fair to say that the 2019/20 season is not going very well.</p>

      <p>But that does not mean that everything should be doom and gloom. So, with that in mind, here are three positives from the season thus far.</p>

      <h3>3. The end of dead wood</h3>
      <p>In the summer, Arsenal needed to utterly upheave the squad and rebuild from the ground up. Many of the layovers from the Arsene Wenger era did not suit the trajectory of the modern team, while resources were being wasted on several players with expensive contracts and poor performances. And so far this season, it seems as though Unai Emery is willing to commit to this high turnover of personnel.</p>
      <p><a href="https://paininthearsenal.com/?s=shkodran+mustafi">Shkodran Mustafi</a> has been jettisoned from the squad, only used in domestic cup matches and Europa League games. His performances, curiously, have been quite positive this season, but his time at the club is nearing an end. Also at centre-back, <a href="https://paininthearsenal.com/?s=sokratis">Sokratis</a> might be nearing the end of his tether, with Calum Chambers and Rob Holding both usurping him in the pecking order prior to the international break.</p>
      <p>And then there is <a href="https://paininthearsenal.com/?s=granit+xhaka">Granit Xhaka</a>, who also looks set to depart from the club in the near future after his captaincy calamity. Xhaka has been stripped of the captaincy, has not played another minute since being booed off the pitch against Crystal Palace and has been surpassed on a footballing level by many players in the squad, especially Matteo Guendouzi. If Arsenal are to move on from these players, as the early part of this season suggests, that is no bad thing.</p>
      <p>
