      <p>BATON ROUGE, La. — Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards is battling to defy the partisan odds in the ruby red South and win reelection to a seat that President Donald Trump wants returned to Republicans.</p>
      <p>Saturday’s election has become a nail-biter, with no clear favourite for victory.</p>
      <p>Trump has made the runoff election between the Deep South’s only Democratic governor and GOP businessman Eddie Rispone a test of his own popularity and political prowess.</p>
      <p>The president particularly wants to capture Louisiana’s governorship for the GOP after Democrats ousted a Republican incumbent in Kentucky. Trump made three trips to Louisiana to rally against Edwards.</p>
      <p>But in targeting Louisiana’s moderate Democratic incumbent, the president is trying to replace a governor who still maintains positive approval ratings.</p>
      <p>Polls in Louisiana close at 8 p.m.</p>
