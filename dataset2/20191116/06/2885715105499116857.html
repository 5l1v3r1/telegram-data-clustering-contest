      <p>Robert Downey Jr will apparently reprise the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man one more time. Tony may have perished while obliterating Thanos and his army due to the damage caused to his body while using all the Infinity Stones simultaneously, but it appears that this was not the end of the road for the character.</p>
      <p>Jeff Goldblum, also known as the Grandmaster in MCU, spilled the beans to Buzzfeed. He said in an interview, “I played the part again a couple of days ago. I went to the Disney studios and I recorded the Grandmaster’s voice for an episode of a show that’s gonna be on Disney+ that’s called What If…?”</p>
      <p>He added, “It’s an animated version of all the characters we know and love from Marvel and this episode included the Grandmaster and Iron Man, so Robert Downey will do a voice for that, and Korg. Taika Waititi had already recorded his voice for that, so yeah, for a couple of hours I enjoyed doing that.”</p>
      <p>The What If…? animated series will imagine alternate scenarios regarding some events and characters within the MCU. Basically, what would have happened if certain things occurred differently.</p>
      <p>“The series is based on possibilities that we thought of over the years. It takes a storyline you know, bring about a bit of a change in it. So, 23 films you’ve seen, one episode from each has been changed,” Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige told the audience at the Disney’s D23 Expo in August this year.</p>
