      <p>Mexico City - New Zealand's <b>Danny Lee</b>, seeking his first US PGA Tour title in more than four years, fired a nine-under-par 62 on Friday to grab the first-round lead at the Mayakoba Classic.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old South Korean-born player made eight birdies and an eagle against a lone bogey in jumping to the top of the leaderboard at Playa del Carmen, Mexico, after play was entirely rained out on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Americans Brendon Todd and Adam Long shared second on 63 with a US pack of Vaughn Taylor, Mark Hubbard, Zach Johnson and Chris Baker on 64 and Americans Billy Horschel and Harris English on 65.</p>
      <p>Lee opened with a birdie, made another at the par-3 fourth and then eagled the par-5 fifth hole before running off a streak of three birdies in a row from the sixth through eighth holes.</p>
      <p>Lee ran off another three in a row from the 11th to par-5 13th holes before a three-putt bogey at 14 and four closing pars.</p>
      <p>"For some reason, starting from three, my game felt really, really good," Lee said, noting how he has changed his swing to add driving distance.</p>
      <p>"The new swing is working into my body now. I'm feeling better with all my clubs and wedges. It has been showing me a lot of good results."</p>
      <p>The only PGA victory for Lee came at the 2015 Greenbrier Classic in a four-man playoff with a par on the second extra hole. He also captured the 2009 Johnnie Walker Classic on the European Tour as a 19-year-old amateur.</p>
      <p>Lee finished second at the CJ Cup in South Korea last month and was second in last year's Mayakoba Classic to American Matt Kuchar.</p>
      <p>England's Luke Donald and Northern Ireland's Graeme McDowell opened on 66 to share 10th.</p>
