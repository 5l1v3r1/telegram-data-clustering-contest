      <h3>Manchester United are interested in rescuing former Liverpool FC midfielder Emre Can from his nightmare at Juventus, according to a report in Italy.</h3>
      <p>Italian media outlet <i>Calciomercato</i>, as quoted by the <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/man-utd-target-emre-can-20882408">Daily Star</a>, state that Juventus are ready to sell Can after the Germany international fell down the pecking order under Maurizio Sarri.</p>
      <p>The same article states that Juventus won’t hold out for Can’s £42.7m (€50m) contract release clause to make the 25-year-old an attractive proposition ahead of the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>According to the same story, the Serie A champions want a fee of between £34.2m and £25.6m for the German star – but Juve would consider a loan deal before a permanent transfer in the summer.</p>
      <p>The report goes on to suggest Manchester United could make a move, given that the Red Devils are thought to be in the market to sign a new midfielder following the departures of Marouane Fellaini and Ander Herrera.</p>
      <p>Can spent four seasons at Liverpool FC between 2014 and 2018, scoring a respectable 14 goals in 166 games for the Merseyside outfit.</p>
      <p>The German midfielder moved to Juventus on a free transfer from Liverpool FC, missing out on the chance to lift the Champions League title last term.</p>
      <p>However, Can did get a Serie A winner’s medal after he netted four goals in 29 games in the Italian top flight.</p>
