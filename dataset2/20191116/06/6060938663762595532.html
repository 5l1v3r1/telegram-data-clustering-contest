Such was the craze for Sidharth and co-star <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Riteish-Deshmukh">Riteish Deshmukh</a> that they were thronged by a crowd of fans eager for a selfie outside the theatre. Producer Nikkhil Advani and director Milap Zaveri had accompanied the actors to gauge live audience reaction to ‘Marjaavaan’. With the help of guards, Sidharth and Riteish managed to safely wrap the post release promotions of the film.</p>
