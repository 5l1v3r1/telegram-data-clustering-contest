      <h1>Chard galette recipe</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T06:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/catherine-phipps/" target="_blank">Catherine Phipps</a></address>
      <p>This is a very good receptacle for leftovers – heels of cheese, roasted root vegetables, and of course, any greens. It is very quick if you have enough cooked greens and a packet of vacuum-packed beetroot, though of course, the flavour is better if you roast fresh beetroot and then use their leaves in the galette. The rosemary oil at the end isn’t essential, but it does add an extra depth and smokiness.</p>
      <p><b>Prep time</b>: 35 minutes, plus 30 minutes chilling time |<b> Cooking time</b>: 1 hour - 1 hour 10 minutes</p>
      <h3>SERVES</h3>
      <p>Four</p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
      <p>
        <b>For the filling</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>400g chard, stems and leaves separated, finely shredded</li>
        <li>3 cloves of garlic, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 sprigs of rosemary, finely chopped</li>
        <li>200g new or waxy potatoes, sliced, or cooked beetroot, cut into wedges</li>
        <li>100g cheddar, grated</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>For the pastry</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>300g wholewheat spelt flour</li>
        <li>A pinch of sea salt</li>
        <li>175g butter</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>For the rosemary oil</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>4 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>A few sprigs of rosemary</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>METHOD</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Start with the filling. Heat the olive oil and butter in a large frying pan and add the chard stems. Cook for five to 10 minutes over a medium heat until lightly coloured, then add the garlic and chard leaves.</li>
        <li> Pour in 50ml water, then cover and leave the chard to wilt. Stir in the rosemary and cool. At the same time, cook the potatoes in salted boiling water until tender. Drain and cool.</li>
        <li>Next, make the pastry. Put the flour into a bowl with a pinch of salt. Add the butter and rub in until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Alternatively do this in a food processor or in a stand mixer using the beater attachment.</li>
        <li> Add the egg and work in just enough iced water to bring together into a smooth, slightly tacky dough. Form into a ball, then cover in plastic wrap and chill for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 200C/180C fan/Gas 6.</li>
        <li>Roll out the pastry on a floured surface to a round of approximately 30-35cm diameter. Transfer the round to your largest baking sheet – you will probably find that it will overlap slightly, but it is still much easier to assemble in situ.</li>
        <li>Mix the chard with the potatoes or beetroot, then pile on to the pastry, leaving a border of around 4-5cm. Sprinkle with the cheese.</li>
        <li>Fold in the borders of the pastry so they cover the outer limits of the filling – don’t worry about any pleating and overlapping; it will have to in places. Brush with beaten egg. Bake for 35-40 minutes, until well browned.</li>
        <li> Meanwhile, make the rosemary oil. Put the rosemary on a baking sheet and brown in the oven for a few minutes. Crush in a pestle and mortar, then mix with the olive oil.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the galette with the rosemary oil. It is best served on the warm side of room temperature with a green salad.</li>
      </ol>
