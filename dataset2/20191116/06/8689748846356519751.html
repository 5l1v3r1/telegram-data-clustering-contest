      <h1>Merqury Quaye apologizes to DJ Black over Ghana DJ Awards outburst on Joy FM</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T06:09:27+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 06:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.ghbase.com/author/staff/" target="_blank">Nana Yaw</a></address>
      <p>Media personality and CEO of Merqury Republic, organizers of the annual Ghana DJ Awards, Merqury Quaye, has sent a word of apology to DJ Black for his recent outburst on Joy FM over the 2019 Ghana DJ Awards controversy.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, November 9, 2019, Merqury Quaye went berserk on Joy FM’s ‘Showbiz A to Z’ with host Naa Ashorkor over <a href="http://www.ghbase.com/dj-black-reacts-to-dj-switch-winning-the-best-dj-award/">DJ Black’s comment on DJ Switch winning the overall Best DJ Award at the 2019 Ghana DJ Awards ceremony</a>.</p>
      <p>Merqury indicated that DJ Black has been telling him privately that he does not want to be nominated again by the Ghana DJ Awards committee but he (Merqury Quaye) advised him to issue a statement to that effect.</p>
      <p>He said when he was nominated for this year’s award ceremony, DJ Black messaged him privately on WhatsApp to ask him if he will win, otherwise, he won’t attend the ceremony. <b><a href="https://www.ghbase.com/we-wont-nominate-dj-black-again-he-should-return-all-the-awards-he-won-previously-to-us-organiser-of-ghana-dj-awards-fumes/">Read the full story here.</a></b></p>
      <p>Merqury Quaye has, however, revealed the cause of his recent outburst on Joy FM in an interview with Zionfelix on Radio Universe.</p>
      <p>According to Merqury, he was not in the ‘right frame of mind’ coming off the <a href="http://www.ghbase.com/popular-ghanaian-dj-dies-in-a-fatal-accident-after-winning-an-award-at-the-just-ended-ghana-dj-awards/">shocking news of the demise of DJ Seihor</a> who won the “Battle of our Time” category barely 24 hours after the event.</p>
      <p>
        <i>
          <b>“I was invited by Joy FM for an interview. I was not in my very right frame of mind and I was provoked which led to me making to certain comments which I have apologized for and I will apologize again for some of the statements I made because they were about private conversations I had with DJ Black which I thought was not ethical.”</b>
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>As to whether he regrets the incident that unfolded live on Joy FM, Merqury Quaye was quick to respond that he does not regret but have rather learnt lessons.</p>
      <p><i><b>“I don’t have any regret for what happened but I have learnt my lessons,”</b></i> he said.</p>
      <p>He, however, apologized later but states DJ Black on his own request would never be nominated for the Ghana DJ Awards.</p>
