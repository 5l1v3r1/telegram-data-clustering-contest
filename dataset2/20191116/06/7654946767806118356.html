      <p>That’s no hooker — that’s your arresting officer.</p>
      <p>A Seattle police captain found out the hard way that one of his fellow officers was on undercover vice patrol, a report said.</p>
      <p>The captain, Randal Wollery, 53, propositioned a woman he thought was a hooker — but she was actually an undercover cop, <a href="https://www.kiro7.com/news/local/seattle-police-captain-arrested-in-undercover-vice-operation/1008753601">local television station KIRO 7 reported</a>.</p>
      <p>He was arrested after he offered her $40, the report said.</p>
      <p>The captain, who works in the department’s professional standards bureau, was then rushed though the criminal justice system — getting booked in jail then released in less than half an hour, according to the report.</p>
      <p>“Seattle police arrested a 53-year-old SPD employee last night in an undercover Vice operation in North Seattle,” the police department told the station in a statement.</p>
      <p>“The employee was booked into King County Jail with a request for misdemeanor charges, and the information was forwarded to the Office of Police Accountability,” they added.</p>
      <p>Wollery was suspended after the bust.</p>
