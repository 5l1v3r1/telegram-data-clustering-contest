      <p>Abidjan - Football legend <b>Didier Drogba</b> helped launch a drive Friday to plant a million trees to halt deforestation in <b>Ivory Coast</b>.</p>
      <p>The "One Day, One Million Trees" campaign "is a first step, the start of the recovery," Forestry and Water Resources Minister Alain Richard Donwahi said in Abidjan, the country's main city.</p>
      <p>"Our goal is to recover at least 30 percent (of lost forest cover) by 2030," he said.</p>
      <p>Most of Ivory Coastâ€™s 20,000 square kilometres (7,700 square miles) of forests are considered badly degraded.</p>
      <p>Drogba said the "numbers are alarming," referring to projections that the tropical West African nation would lose all its forest cover in half a century if corrective steps were not taken.</p>
      <p>"I am proud to contribute to Ivory Coast's reforestation through helping awareness," the former Chelsea star said, describing the tree planting as a "noble initiative."</p>
      <p>Ivory Coast, the world's biggest cocoa producer and a major coffee exporter, plans to reforest eight million hectares (20 million acres) by 2045.</p>
