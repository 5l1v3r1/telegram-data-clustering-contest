      <p>London - <b>Rafael Nadal</b> headed home from the ATP Finals on Friday after defending champion <b>Alexander Zverev's</b> win against <b>Daniil Medvedev</b> confirmed the Spaniard's exit from the season-ending tournament.</p>
      <p>The world No 1 recovered to beat Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-7 (4/7), 6-4, 7-5 in the early round-robin match at London's O2 Arena but knew he was dependent on the later result.</p>
      <p>Zverev's 6-4, 7-6 (7/4) win meant he qualified for the semi-finals from Group Andre Agassi alongside Tsitsipas.</p>
      <p>Zverev's win ruined a mouth-watering semi-final between Nadal and six-time champion <b>Roger Federer</b>, as the Spaniard would have topped the group had Zverev lost to Medvedev.</p>
      <p>But instead it was Tsitsipas who topped the group and he will now play Federer in Saturday's semi-finals while Zverev will meet Dominic Thiem, who finished ahead of Federer in Group Bjorn Borg.</p>
      <p>German seventh seed Zverev broke the fourth-seeded Medvedev early, with the Russian knowing he was already heading out of the tournament after two defeats.</p>
      <p>But Medvedev dug deep in the second set, fending off the single break point engineered by Zverev and took it to a tie-break.</p>
      <p>The pair swapped mini-breaks but Medvedev double-faulted to give Zverev a 5-3 lead and the German held his nerve to seal his first match point with an ace.</p>
      <p>"I'm in the semis again, this arena is where I play my best tennis," said Zverev. "We don't play in this atmosphere anywhere else in the world.</p>
      <p>"Today because Daniil had nothing to lose he could just enjoy it, but for me it was must-win. He's been the best player since the summer so all credit to him."</p>

        <b>Nadal assured of No 1</b>
      </p>
      <p>Zverev, who beat Novak Djokovic in the final last year, has had a mixed season but now has the chance to end it on a high in London.</p>
      <p>Nadal, who has already secured the year-end number one ranking, has never won the end-of-season tournament and had a miserable start at the O2 Arena, being outplayed by Zverev in his opening match.</p>
      <p>But the 19-time Grand Slam champion produced an astonishing comeback to defeat Medvedev on Wednesday and give himself a chance of qualifying from the round-robin phase.</p>
      <p>Tsitsipas, 21, had already qualified for the semi-finals before Friday's match after beating Medvedev and Zverev.</p>
      <p>Serve dominated in the first set on Friday, with Tsitsipas taking it on a tie-break.</p>
      <p>But Nadal put increasing pressure on his opponent's serve and a single break in sets two and three were enough for him to seal the match.</p>
      <p>Following his win Nadal was in the strange position of not knowing whether he would qualify for the knockout rounds or not.</p>
      <p>He received the trophy for finishing the year as the top-ranked player on the court at the O2.</p>
      <p>"I'm super happy," he said. "Honestly, after all the things I went through in my career in terms of injuries I never thought at the age of 33-and-a-half I would have this trophy in my hands again.</p>
      <p>"It's something really, really emotional for me. A lot of work in the shadows to be where we are today."</p>
      <p>Federer secured a spot in the semi-finals for the 16th time in his career on Thursday by beating Djokovic in straight sets.</p>
