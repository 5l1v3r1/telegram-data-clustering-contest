      <p>COLOMBO: Gunmen fired on buses carrying minority Muslim voters in northwest Sri Lanka on Saturday, police said, as an election official admitted failures to protect vulnerable communities ahead of presidential polls.<br/>There were no immediate reports of casualties, but a police official said the attackers had burnt tires on the road and set up makeshift roadblocks to ambush the convoy of more than 100 vehicles.<br/>“The gunmen opened fire and also pelted stones,” said a police official in Tantirimale, 240 kilometers north of the capital Colombo. “At least two buses were hit, but we have no reports of casualties.”<br/>Muslims from the coastal town of Puttalam were traveling to the neighboring district of Mannar, where they were registered to vote, the official added.<br/>Sri Lanka’s minority Tamils and Muslims are seen as crucial to deciding a close contest between the two frontrunners — housing minister Sajith Premadasa and the opposition’s Gotabaya Rajapaksa.<br/>One of three Election Commissioners, Ratnajeevan Hoole, said the authorities failed to provide adequate protection to internally displaced minority Muslims in the multi-ethnic northwest.<br/>“They (the Muslims) asked for polling booths in the areas where they are living without having to travel a long distance to their original village to vote,” Hoole said in a statement.<br/>“They were sure that a disturbance like this would happen,” he said, adding that his pleas for protection were not considered by the Election Commission, which works through majority decisions.<br/>Police reinforcements rushed to the troubled area, cleared the road obstructions and escorted the convoy so passengers could cast their ballots.<br/>The incident came as police and troops were locked in a tense standoff in the Tamil-dominated northern peninsula of Jaffna where residents complained about military roadblocks ahead of voting.<br/>Police reported to the independent Election Commission that the army was illegally manning roadblocks that could discourage residents from freely traveling to polling booths.<br/>“After bringing to the notice of the army that the roadblocks were illegal at a time of a national election, they have dismantled them,” police said in a statement.<br/>Police sources said they had also warned local military commanders that any disruption to the election would be reported to courts and offenders prosecuted.<br/>The police also arrested 10 men who were unable to explain their presence in the Jaffna peninsula on the eve of voting.<br/>“We suspect they were trying to create trouble during voting,” a police official said.<br/>Local media reports say there are fears that a strong military presence in Jaffna, the heartland of the island’s Tamil minority, could influence voter turnout and favor Rajapaksa, a former defense ministry chief and brother of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa.</p>
