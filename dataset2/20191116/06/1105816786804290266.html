      <p><b>KARACHI: </b>With the shaadi season rapidly dawning upon us once more, there’s no better time to experiment with your makeup routine and try out some looks that is sure to turn heads.</p>
      <p>Luckily, celebrities of late have been seriously inspiring us with their creative ways to enhance their faces. Thinking of a glitzy look for New Year celebrations? Look no further than to fashion it-girl Gigi Hadid who is shining brighter than a star.</p>
      <p>Dark lips colours are also making their way back to the trending beauty cut. For a seriously sultry look, we see Sabeeka Imam hitting all the right notes.  Yumna Zaidi also shows us how to work red lipstick right.</p>
      <p>Here are some of our top picks by celebrities.</p>
      <p>

      <p>This smudged wing liner trend is popping up everywhere, with top beauty vloggers and Instagrammers showing us how the captivating look is achieved. Model Zara Peerzada certainly knows how to accentuate her eyes in all the right ways. Use a liquid black liner to draw a small flick, followed by dark eye shadow or pencil liner to follow the flick. Smudge slightly and line the inner bottom of your eyes. Pair with  matte, warm nude lipstick.</p>

      <p>Red lipstick is back baby and we are not complaining! For a truly soft and dreamy look, we love actor Yumna Zaidi’s take on the trend. Use a matching matte lip liner to lightly shape lips, then go in with a red shade by applying with fingers. Blot the sharpness of the red by putting mouth on a tissue. Use a baby pink blush on cheeks and nose, even for eye shadow. Keep eyes minimal with a flick of mascara.</p>

        <b>Classic red lips and cat eyes </b>
      </p>

      <p>Oh-la-la, mademoiselle. Get those classic french vibes with Pakistani–British model Sabeeka Imam by doing a cat eye and deep red lipstick for your next event. Keep eye shadow to a matte light brown or taupe and carefully make a sharp flick with waterproof liquid liner. Choose a deep red classic red lipstick to complete the look.<a href="https://tribune.com.pk/story/2096042/4-3-hairstyle-trends-hollywood-celebs-inspire-next-look/">3 hairstyle trends by Hollywood celebs to inspire your next look</a></p>
      <p>Beauty hack: Scared of not doing the flick right? Get some sticky tape and angle on both eyes to make a perfectly symmetrical line before going in with liner.</p>

        <b>Champagne evening glam</b>

      <p>Looking for all those right nude shades without seeming washed out? Sadaf Kanwal aces this makeup trend by selecting a warm, champagne nude lipstick to suit her skin tone. Use bronzer to warm and contour your face. Use a shimmery, champagne eye shadow and use finger to smudge on eyelids, as well as pencil liner. Slightly line watermark and blend.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Half-glitter eyeshadow</b>
      </p>

      <p>Yep, Gigi Hadid does it again. The American-Palestinian model serves major inspiration for a New Year’s event by donning this gold eyeshadow look that makes her shine brighter than a star. Rather than use a loose gold glitter all over the eyes, first use a neutral matte shadow over all the eyes and then use a brush to dust the glitter over half the lid. This gives a glam look without going overboard, keeping it classy. Pair with a cat-eye flick and and a war, shiny nude lip.</p>
