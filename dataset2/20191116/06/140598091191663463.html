      <p>These offer a more robust density than a regular waffle, but are still lighter than bubble and squeak, so no stodge.</p>
      <p><b>Prep time</b>: 20 minutes |<b> Cooking time</b>: 10 minutes</p>
      <h3>MAKES</h3>
      <p>Around 16</p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>50g butter, melted</li>
        <li>60ml buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, separated</li>
        <li>1 tbsp wholegrain mustard</li>
        <li>500g mashed potato</li>
        <li>500g cooked greens – anything robust (I like sprout tops, shredded sprouts, chard, kale)</li>
        <li>100g cheddar, grated (optional)</li>
        <li>85g plain flour</li>
        <li>½ tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ tsp bicarbonate of soda</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>METHOD</h3>
      <ol>
        <li> Heat your waffle maker to medium.</li>
        <li>Mix together the butter, buttermilk, egg yolks and wholegrain mustard, then stir in the mashed potatoes, greens and cheese, if using.</li>
        <li>Whisk the flour, baking powder and bicarbonate of soda with a generous amount of salt and pepper. Fold this through the batter, making sure you keep the mixing to a bare minimum.</li>
        <li>Whisk the egg whites to stiff peaks, then fold a tablespoon into the batter, just to loosen it slightly. Add the rest, again, folding in as gently as possible and keeping the mixing to the absolute minimum.</li>
        <li> Spread some of the mixture over your waffle iron, making sure you don’t overfill it – it should just barely cover the tips of the indentations. Cook until set and turning a rich brown on the ridges – often up to around 10 minutes, depending on your waffle iron.</li>
        <li> Keep the cooked waffles warm in a low oven while you make the rest.</li>
        <li> Serve with anything you like – I spread them with butter and/or top with bacon and maple syrup.</li>
      </ol>
