      <h1>Winter salad of red leaves, mackerel and orange recipe</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T06:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/catherine-phipps/" target="_blank">Catherine Phipps</a></address>
      <p>This is a good salad to prepare ahead and will keep well in the fridge as long as you follow the salting instructions below – if you skip this step, the vegetables will go soggy. There are other greens that work well in this salad. Horseradish leaves, when young, give a bit of a kick. Shred some finely and add to the serving greens. Mustard greens will give a similar effect; mizuna is also mustardy but much milder.</p>
      <p><b>Prep time</b>: 25 minutes, plus one hour to stand</p>
      <h3>SERVES</h3>
      <p>Four</p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>250g red cabbage, finely shredded</li>
        <li>2 heads of red chicory, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>1 large carrot, preferably purple, julienned</li>
        <li>2 sticks of celery (plus leaves from the centre of the bunch), sliced</li>
        <li>1 red onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>½ tsp caster sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp white wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1 blood orange</li>
        <li>400g smoked mackerel, skinned, deboned and roughly broken up</li>
        <li>2 tbsp capers, rinsed</li>
        <li>1 small bunch of dill, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 small bunch of mint, leaves only, finely chopped</li>
        <li>A few sprigs of tarragon, finely chopped</li>
        <li>A handful of baby beetroot leaves</li>
        <li>A few purple kale leaves, destemmed and massaged</li>
        <li>A few horseradish, mustard green or mizuna leaves</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>For the dressing</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>1 heaped tbsp crème fraîche</li>
        <li>2 tsp wholegrain mustard</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sherry vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp hazelnut or walnut oil</li>
        <li>Juice from 1 blood orange</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>METHOD </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Put the cabbage, red chicory, carrot, celery sticks and onion into a large colander and sprinkle with a teaspoon of sea salt, the sugar and vinegar. Mix thoroughly and set over a bowl or stand in your sink. Cover with a tea towel and leave to stand for an hour.</li>
        <li> Transfer the vegetables to a serving bowl. Prepare the orange by topping and tailing it, cutting away the skin and outer membrane, then dicing the remaining flesh, flicking out any seeds or large pieces of pith. Squeeze juice from the discarded skin into a bowl.</li>
        <li>Make the dressing by adding the crème fraîche, wholegrain mustard, sherry vinegar and oil to the orange juice. Season with salt and pepper and whisk together.</li>
        <li> Pour the dressing over the salad, then add the mackerel, capers and orange. Fold over gently to combine everything, then add the herbs and the celery leaves.</li>
        <li>Fold over once more. Serve on a bed of the remaining leaves.</li>
      </ol>
