      <h1>The rat runs you said are the worst in Bristol</h1>
      <h2>Some are not designed to cope with high levels of traffic</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T06:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Alexander Brock</a></address>
      <p>Bristol is notorious for lengthy <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/traffic-travel">traffic</a> jams and motorists can find themselves stuck in congestions for hours at times.</p>
      <p>It's not surprise then that some opt to use 'rat runs' - smaller roads, often through rural and suburban communities, which can get them to their destination quicker.</p>
      <p>However, some of these routes are simply not designed to cope with high levels of traffic, which could put pedestrians and other road users at risk and can delays for residents.</p>
      <p>Bristol Live asked motorists on social media to list their worst rat runs in the city and surrounding area - here's what they had to say.</p>
      <p>
        <b>1. Dunkeld Avenue, Filton</b>
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>Two people named this route through <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/filton">Filton</a> between Kenmore Crescent and Charborough Road as particularly bad for <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/traffic-travel">traffic</a>.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2. Broomhill Road, Conham</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sue Sedley said Broomhill Road is used as short cut, leading to heavy delays for those living on the road.</p>
      <p>She said: "We live there and have to go to work a hour or more early so we can just get off our driveway, and not get caught in a mile queue."</p>
      <p>
        <b>3. Old Quarry Road, <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/shirehampton">Shirehampton</a></b>
      </p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Kim Tudor said: "Drivers use this road to avoid the queue on Kings Weston Avenue.</p>
      <p>"Definitely an 'accident waiting to happen' as several near misses already!"</p>
      <p>
        <b>4. Park Crescent, St George</b>
      </p>
      <p>Claire Downie said Park Crescent in <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/st-george">St George</a> is "a total nightmare and a big accident waiting to happen".</p>
      <p>
        <b>5. Hengrove Lane, Hengrove</b>
      </p>
      <figure>

      <p>Lisa Goodman said: "<a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/hengrove">Hengrove</a> Lane is a rat run between West Town Lane and Wells Road to Airport Road despite it being 20mph."</p>
      <p>
        <b>6. Craven Way, Longwell Green</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to Jacqui Letheby, drivers use this as a rat run rather than waiting in the dual carriageway traffic on the A4174.</p>
      <p>
        <b>7. Queensholm Crescent, <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/downend">Downend</a></b>

      </p>
      <p>Similar to the above, Suzanne Davis said this road is used to avoid the ring road A1471.</p>
      <p>
        <b>8. Queen Street, <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/kingswood">Kingswood</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>This road between Hillside Road and the A420 Two Mile Hill Road was named by one motorist.</p>
      <p>
        <b>9. Long Cross, Lawrence Weston</b>
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>One motorist said vehicles used this road in <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/lawrence-weston">Lawrence Weston</a> as a cut through for <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/avonmouth">Avonmouth.</a></p>
      <p>
        <b>10. Whiteway Road, <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/speedwell">Speedwell</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>Mary O'Ryan said Whiteway Road is a "nightmare" to get through these days.</p>
      <p>
        <b>11. Crown Hill. St George</b>
      </p>
