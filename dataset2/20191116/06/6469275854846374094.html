        <b>A Preston man who was a prisoner of war during World War II has celebrated his 100th birthday with more than 70 family members and friends.</b>
      </p>
      <p>During the second global conflict, more than 170,000 British prisoners of war were taken by German and Italian forces.</p>
      <p>Between 1940 and 1942, they were held in a network of prisoners’ camps stretching from Poland to Italy.</p>
      <p>George Leslie Hall, born in Preston in 1919, was captured by German soldiers in 1942, in El Alamein, Egypt, where he was fighting with the Durham Light Infantry.</p>
      <p>He spent three and a half years as a prisoner, held by the Nazis in prisoners’ camps around Europe, and ended up in Italy, where he was set free at the end of the war.</p>
      <p>When asked what if feels like to be turning 100, George said: “I feel lucky, like a millionaire.”</p>
      <p>After the war, George returned to Preston and married Peggy, with whom he had three children.</p>
      <p>George had lost both his parents to TB when he was still in school, in 1932, and after the war he worked as a barber and as a bus driver in Preston until retirement.</p>
      <p>He added: “It is very important to remember those who have given their lives for this country.”</p>
      <p>Peggy and George had been married for more than 60 years when she died five years ago.</p>
      <p>Norma King, George’s daughter, said: “We feel very blessed to have him for so long, and he is doing really well.</p>
      <p>“He is very independent: I cook his dinner in the evenings, but he makes his own breakfast and sandwiches for lunch.</p>
      <p>“He had such a wonderful time at the birthday party, surrounded by his family and friends.”</p>
      <p>George’s five grandchildren and 10 great grandchildren joined the celebrations for his 100th birthday at Guardian Close retirement home in Fulwood.</p>
      <p>After a century on this Earth, he said that the secret to a long life is happiness.</p>
