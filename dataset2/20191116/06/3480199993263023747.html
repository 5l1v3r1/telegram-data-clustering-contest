      <p>Rebellious students and anti-government protesters abandoned their occupation of at least one major Hong Kong university on Saturday.</p>
      <p>But some other schools remained under control of demonstrators after a near week-long siege by police.</p>
      <p>Major traffic disruptions plagued Hong Kong even as schools and universities remained closed in the city of 7.5 million people.</p>
      <p>Police retook control of suburban Chinese University of Hong Kong after students and protesters left.</p>

      <p>Authorities said all northbound lanes of Tolo Highway, which the protesters had blocked, were reopened, and the southbound lanes would follow soon.</p>
      <p>Police and protesters fought intense running battles at the Chinese University campus Tuesday, which had been transformed into a fortress by hundreds of protesters.</p>
      <p>The presidents of nine universities issued a joint statement late on Friday calling on the government to resolve the political deadlock and restore safety and public order.</p>
      <p>“No political viewpoint gives a license to damage property, employ physical threats, or use violence against individuals,” the statement read.</p>
      <p>“It is regrettable that societal disagreement has led to university campuses becoming major political battlefields, and that the government response has so far not been effective.”</p>
      <p>The anti-government protests are now in their sixth month.</p>
