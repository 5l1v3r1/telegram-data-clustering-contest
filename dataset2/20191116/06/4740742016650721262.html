      <h1>The new laws coming into effect in Britain in 2020</h1>
      <h2>From organ donation to holiday pay</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T06:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Tristan Cork</a></address>
      <p>We have had a parliament in gridlock, a Government with no working majority, two Prime Ministers leading a coalition of sorts and everything stopping for <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> - but remarkably, there are new laws coming into effect in the next few months, and into 2020.</p>
      <p>They will affect our every day lives, and one in particular, goes to the core of the meaning of life, what happens when we're dead and what rights we have over our bodies.</p>
      <p>So here, in a nutshell, are the new laws that will come into effect in 2020 - that we know about already.</p>
      <h3>Keira and Max's Law</h3>

      <p>Then Prime Minister <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/theresa-may">Theresa May</a> named the new organ donation law after two children: A lad from Newcastle, called Max, who is know running around with the heart of a girl called Keira, who died at a hospital in Bristol following a car crash.</p>
      <p>Keira's parents were asked if they wanted to donate her organs, and said 'yes', and she went on to save four people's lives, including Max's.</p>
      <p>The new law comes into effect in the spring of 2020, and basically flips the current arrangement, which means someone has to have opted in to agreeing to donate their organs before they die, or their family has to give permission.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The new law will mean that consent will be presumed unless people have opted out. At the moment you have to tell your family beforehand, or get a donor card, if you want to be an organ donor should you be hit by a bus. From the Spring of 2020, you'll have to carry a card to say you DON'T want to be a donor.</p>
      <p>You still have a choice if you want to be an organ donor or not when you die, it's just that now doctors and the donation team will assume you do unless you said beforehand.</p>
      <p>There are excluded groups from this: children, those judged not mentally fit enough to make that informed choice, people visiting England or someone who hasn't lived here in England for more than year.</p>

      <h3>Driving</h3>
      <p>A whole host of new laws affecting driving were passed during 2019, with many taking effect on January 1, 2020, and into the new year.</p>
      <p>Then, of course we have Brexit, which is scheduled to take place on the last day of January 2020, albeit this may be subject to change.</p>
      <p>With climate change a growing issue and the technology around vehicles and driving always changing, we've put together this handy guide of the law changes you need to know about.</p>
      <h4>Low Emission Rules</h4>
      <p>Going to London?</p>
      <p>In April 2019 London’s new Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) came into effect, replacing the previous T-charge scheme.</p>
      <p>It aims to reduce harmful emissions in the capital and improving air quality.</p>
      <p>If a vehicle doesn’t meet ULEZ emission standards, the driver will have to pay a charge to drive in the area: £12.50 for most vehicles (cars, motorcycles and vans) and £100 for heavier vehicles like lorries.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Bristol looks set to ban diesel cars -<a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristols-controversial-clean-air-plans-3505457"> this has now been passed by the council,</a> and - subject to the Government changing in the law in 2020. If that happens, the Bristol diesel ban will come into effect the year after.</p>
      <h4>Tax changes</h4>
      <p>In April this year, Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) went up in line with inflation, according to the Retail Prices Index. These VED rises apply to all cars, and for most drivers they unfortunately mean annual car tax costs have already increased by £5.</p>
      <p>Existing owners of high emission cars will be charged up to an additional £15, while diesel car owners whose vehicles fail to meet the RDE2 emissions standard (that will become mandatory next year), will continue to pay higher tax rates. Meanwhile new car buyers could face an extra £65 on first-year car tax.</p>
      <h4>Smart Motorways</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.bristolpost.co.uk/incoming/article2687988.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Red-X-sign.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>
          <cite>(Image: Highways England)</cite>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h4> </h4>
      <p>It’s illegal to drive in a lane closed by a red X sign on a smart motorway. If caught, you could receive a fixed penalty of up to £100 and three points, and in some cases stronger penalties. Legislation is not yet completed on this issue.</p>
      <p>Highways England plans to start building in more emergency refuge areas across the smart motorway network, with work due to begin on the M25 later this year.</p>
      <p>With the conversion of many hard shoulders into running lanes on smart motorways, the RAC have been leading calls to grow the number of refuge areas to reduce the risk for those who may suffer a breakdown or crash further from a refuge area.</p>
      <h4>Intelligent Speed Assist</h4>
      <p>Intelligent Speed Assist is a feature which will become mandatory for the safety of new cars from 2022 under the EU’s revised General Safety Regulation. The goal is to increase road safety and minimise collisions.</p>
      <p>Other soon-to-be mandatory safety systems include warnings for driver distraction and drowsiness, cameras/sensors for reversing, advanced emergency braking, lane keeping assistance and a ‘black box’ data recorder for incident reporting.</p>
      <h4>Driving Permits and Green Cards</h4>
      <p>When the UK leaves the European Union, many of us may require new licences. In January this year the Government released new guidance informing Brits their current driving licenses will be useless on the continent in a no-deal scenario.</p>
      <p>If you’re planning to drive in the EU as a holidaymaker or visitor, you will have to spend £5.50 on an international permit if we leave without a deal. This will be available to purchase from Post Office.</p>
      <p>You will need to carry a motor insurance green card when driving in the EU and EEA. Contact your insurance provider one month before you travel to obtain green cards for your vehicle, caravan or trailer.</p>
      <h4>Parking surcharges and new legislation</h4>
      <p>Parliament's <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/transport">Transport</a> Committee is looking at the contentious issue of pavement parking and whether there are ways to increase safety for pedestrians and reduce costly damage to walkways. A pavement parking ban has been in place in London since 1974, however there could be new legislation introduced that would see restrictions extended across England.</p>
      <p>A blanket ban is opposed by some, so it’s unlikely that this will come into effect any time soon. The RAC has also been leading the charge to implement a new code of practice that will help protect drivers from unscrupulous parking companies by banning certain practices and create a single, independent appeals process throughout England.</p>
      <p>Nearly 10,000 people approached the Citizens Advice Bureau for guidance on parking tickets last year, the latest is that new legislation has been passed but the working group is yet to conclude new code of practice.</p>
      <h4>Recently qualified drivers</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.bristolpost.co.uk/news/motoring/article900430.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Learner-driver.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Recently qualified drivers could also face changes once they have passed, with the government even considering bringing in a graduated driving licence.</p>
      <p>Currently, new drivers who have been behind the wheel for less than two years face stronger penalties for offences like using a mobile phone.</p>
      <p>However, a whole range of restrictions could also be imposed.</p>
      <p>The RAC believes these are likely to focus on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Curfews - Times when they are allowed to be on the road</li>
        <li>Passengers - Limits for how many passengers a new driver can have</li>
        <li>Speed - Separate, lower speed limits to other drivers</li>
        <li>Engine sizes - Limits on how powerful their cars can be</li>
        <li>Mandatory P plates - These are currently optional, but could be made mandatory for up to two years</li>
        <li>Alcohol - Lower limits than the general driving population</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A pilot scheme for graduated licences will be tested in Northern Ireland from 2019 to 2020. This could lead to it being rolled out in England if successful.</p>
      <h4>Overtaking cyclists</h4>
      <p>People may soon be encouraged to use the "Dutch reach" when opening their car doors.</p>
      <p>Drivers will also be instructed to give way to cyclists and pedestrians when turning left.</p>
      <p>The reason this is happening is to provide some clarity to the current Highway Code.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/motorists-could-forced-always-give-13437796">Mirror</a>, the new guidelines would bring the UK in line with the US, where pedestrians always have priority.</p>
      <p>In 2017, 101 cyclists died in road traffic collisions in the UK.</p>
      <p>Some road safety campaigners have said the code does not do enough to explain how drivers should treat cyclists on the road.</p>
      <h4>Driving lessons on motorways</h4>
      <p>For years, it was the law new drivers could only use motorways once they had already passed their driving test. They are now allowed to use them as part of a lesson when they are accompanied by an instructor with dual controls in the car.</p>
      <p>However, this is only optional - it isn't compulsory for learners to have lessons on them.</p>
      <h4>New MOT rules</h4>
      <figure>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>There are new categories for defects with cars which drivers will have to understand, which are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Dangerous - Direct risk to road safety or the environment. Results in a Fail.</li>
        <li>Major - Could affect safety or the environment. Results in a Fail.</li>
        <li>Minor - No effect on safety, but should be repaired as soon as possible.</li>
        <li>Advisory - Could have an effect in future.</li>
        <li>Pass - Meets the current legal standards.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A variety of new requirements are also being included in the MOT for the first time.</p>
      <p>These checks include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Under-inflated tyres</li>
        <li>Contaminated brake fluid</li>
        <li>Brake pad warning lights and missing brake pads or discs</li>
        <li>Reversing lights (for vehicles newer than September 2009)</li>
        <li>Daytime running lights (for vehicles newer than March 2018).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Some things won't change though - the government considered lengthening the wait for a vehicle's first MOT from three to four years, but it will now remain unchanged.</p>
      <h3>Employment law</h3>
      <p>Lots of laws are changing in April 2020 concerning people's rights as employees, and what employers now have to do.</p>
      <p>The good people at <a href="https://www.brachers.co.uk/knowledge/article/employment-law-changes-preparing-for-april-2020">Brachers law firm</a> have produced <a href="https://www.brachers.co.uk/knowledge/article/employment-law-changes-preparing-for-april-2020">this handy guide</a> to these changes, which are summarised here.</p>
      <h4>Holiday pay</h4>
      <p>When people who earn varying amounts of money from week-to-week - particularly those on flexible contracts - take a paid holiday, the employer has to pay them holiday pay which equates to the average weekly wage they earned over the 12 weeks before that holiday.</p>
      <p>From April 6, 2020, that is changing. From then, employers will have to calculate the average weekly wage from an entire year - 52 weeks - rather than just 12 weeks. This is seen as more fair to the employee, as it is likely that in some cases someone going on holiday in a seasonal job might end up being paid less than they should - for instance if a hotel worker who books a holiday for May would've earned a lot less - so would be paid less holiday pay - than if it had taken into account a busy summer period where they earned more.</p>
      <h4>Parental bereavement leave</h4>
      <p>Back in October 2017, the Government confirmed it would be backing a Private Members bill which subsequently became law in September 2018, and is expected to come into force in early 2020.</p>
      <p>What it does is give workers the right to unpaid leave of up to two weeks, as a right, from day one of their employment, should they suffer the tragedy of their child dying under the age of 18.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.bristolpost.co.uk/news/article123453.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/SANDS-charity.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <p>Obviously, you'd hope most employers would give discretionary compassionate leave in such tragic circumstances, but some don't, and this enshrines in law that people are entitled to two weeks off - albeit unpaid - should their child die.</p>
      <p>This also applies to women who suffer a stillbirth or miscarriage from the 24th week of pregnancy.</p>
      <p>Brachers are urging employers to consider drawing up a written bereavement policy, and also that they should be aware of religious and cultural requirements around bereavement.</p>
