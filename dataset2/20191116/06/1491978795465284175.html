      <h3>Claire on Luke</h3>
      <p><b>What were you hoping for?</b><br/>Someone fun, friendly and easy to talk to. I try not to have high expectations to avoid being disappointed.</p>
      <p><b>First impressions?</b><br/>From a 5ft distance: cute, well-groomed and a good sense of style. Then I sat down and noticed his ring and big chunky necklace, which I was less happy about. I also immediately knew he was a smoker.</p>
      <p><b>What did you talk about?</b><br/>I was keen to know about his salsa dancing, and he was keen to know about my taste in music. We listened to a few songs – I like to think he was satisfied with my choices.</p>
      <p><b>Any awkward moments?</b><br/>He asked if I’d want to go to a swingers’ party, as a joke, but I didn’t know what that was. Later I said table tennis is the only ball game I’m good at: we laughed it off.</p>
      <p><b>Good table manners?</b><br/>Perfect, better than mine.</p>
      <p><b>Best thing about Luke?</b><br/>He can dance salsa.</p>
      <p><b>Would you introduce him to your friends?</b><br/>Yes – they’d want him to take them dancing.</p>
      <p><b>Describe Luke in three words</b><br/>Cute, polite, engaging.</p>
      <p><b>What do you think he made of you?</b><br/>I’m really not sure. He said he would describe me as hot to his friends.</p>
      <p><b>Did you go on somewhere?</b><br/>He wanted to, but I had to work the next day.</p>
      <p><b>And… did you kiss?</b><br/>Yes! Although I basically had to ask for it…</p>
      <p><b>If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?</b><br/>If I had eaten and drunk less, and hadn’t had to work the next day, I would have loved to go on with the night.</p>
      <p><b>Marks out of 10?</b><br/>A solid 7.</p>
      <p><b>Would you meet again?</b><br/>I would, probably as a friend.</p>
      <h3>Luke on Claire</h3>
      <p><b>What </b><b>were you hoping for?</b><br/>Someone who was easy to talk to and had the potential for a few more fun nights in them.</p>
      <p><b>First impressions?</b><br/>Pretty nervous and wearing a great outfit.</p>
      <p><b>What did you talk about?</b><br/>Salsa and <a href="https://www.last.fm/tag/bachata">bachata</a>, our families, the British and their lack of passion. I spent 15 minutes explaining what swingers’ parties are.</p>
      <p><b>Any awkward moments?</b><br/>When we considered having to run out of the restaurant because we didn’t know if the staff knew our meal was meant to be covered.</p>
      <p><b>Good table manners?</b><br/>Didn’t notice at all, so big thumbs up.</p>
      <p><b>Best thing about Claire?</b><br/>Her sense of culture and willingness to experience new music and activities.</p>
      <p><b>Would you introduce her to your friends?</b><br/>Definitely, they would all be able to bitch about me in languages I don’t understand.</p>
      <p><b>Describe Claire in three words</b><br/>Cultured, intelligent, gorgeous.</p>
      <p><b>What do you think she made of you?</b><br/>I think my British sarcasm may occasionally have come across as a little rude.</p>
      <p><b>Did </b><b>you go on somewhere? </b><br/>Just to the tube station – it was a school night after all.</p>
      <p><b>And… did </b><b>you kiss?</b><br/>What’s a date without a kiss?</p>
      <p><b>If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?</b><br/>Have the date on a non-school night; I would have loved to have gone dancing afterwards.</p>
      <p><b>Marks out </b><b>10?</b><br/>8.</p>
      <p><b>Would you meet again?</b><br/>Here’s hoping!</p>
