      <h3>Manchester United are preparing an offer for Red Bull Salzburg striker Erling Braut Haaland, according to a report in Norway.</h3>
      <p>Norwegian media outlet <i>Dagbladbet</i>, as quoted by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/ole-gunnar-solskjaer-instructs-manchester-united-sign-erling-braut-haaland-11124099/">Metro</a>, is reporting that Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is a big admirer of the Salzburg forward.</p>
      <p>The same article states that Solskjaer has instructed Manchester United to push ahead with their plans to sign the 19-year-old after working with Haaland during his stint at Molde.</p>
      <p>According to the same story, the Red Devils boss has informed the Manchester United board how much he believes they should pay for Haaland ahead of the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>The report goes on to suggest that Manchester United are now the favourites to sign Haaland in a big-money deal.</p>
      <p>Manchester United will more than likely have to wait until the summer to recruit Haaland as Salzburg are unlikely to want to sell the striker in January given their hunt for silverware this term, the story concludes.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils sold Romelu Lukaku to Inter Milan in the summer transfer window before Alexis Sanchez followed the Belgian striker to the San Siro on a season-long loan deal.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer’s squad is threadbare in forward positions as the Manchester United manager continues to rely on Anthony Martial, Marcus Rashford and Mason Greenwood up front.</p>
