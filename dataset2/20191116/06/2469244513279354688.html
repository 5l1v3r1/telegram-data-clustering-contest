      <p>"I think at the beginning most of my family thought it was some kind of phase that would pass! Slowly they realised it wasn’t," laughs Josie Blaber.</p>
      <p>We are sitting in the entrance of Lions Den MMA - a small, mixed martial arts gym on the outskirts of Exeter - as Josie talks about the first time she laced up the gloves five years ago.</p>
      <p>"I had just moved back home to Exmouth. I had all sorts going on and was on the lookout for something new to try," she goes on.</p>
      <p>"I thought about kickboxing so I tried Muay Thai. It was alright but it didn’t quite hit the mark.</p>
      <p>"Somebody else suggested I try MMA so I literally texted Dave (Matthews - trainer) asking if I could give it a go. He told me to come along for a session and see what I think. Fortunately I loved it and I haven’t looked back."</p>

      <p>Josie has come a long way since then.</p>
      <p>After years of hard training, sparring and fighting, she will walk out in front of thousands at Wembley Arena next week when she takes on Charlotte McIntyre as part of Bellator London.</p>
      <p>"It was just five years ago that I started, so not really all that long," Josie says. "I was 27 and I am 32 now.</p>
      <p>"It just suited me. I’m quite strong and I have always enjoyed chucking things around.</p>
      <p>"It suits me as a person too – you need to be quite dedicated. I’m a really active person and you need to have that drive too, which I think I do."</p>

      <p>Chatting to Josie, you probably would not put her down as a fighter at first glance.</p>
      <p>She has no black eyes, no split lips. She used to work on a farm, but is now at the Donkey Sanctuary looking after the animals near Sidmouth.</p>
      <p>But it is a different story watching her on the pads with Dave - a well-known coach in the area who helped fellow Exmouth fighter Craig White <a href="https://www.devonlive.com/sport/craig-white-ufc-diego-sanchez-1978944">reach the UFC</a> last year.</p>
      <p>Not only are her arms like pistons when she throws a punch, but her kicks hit the pads with a vicious thwack which make me glad I am not her opponent next Saturday night.</p>

      <p>"I love training in the gym and the people in there – it feels like family," she explains.</p>
      <p>"The atmosphere is a huge part of it. We all muck in and have a laugh. Dave's great too."</p>
      <p>If Josie is nervous about fighting in front of a huge crowd at the weekend then she is not showing it.</p>
      <p>There is plenty at stake. Not only has she spent hundreds on her medical tests proving she is fit and healthy, but the fight game is a fickle business and fighters can quickly fall down the pile if they do not quickly prove themselves.</p>

        <figcaption>"I just want to be as good as I can be," says Josie</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Josie says: "I’m honestly excited at the thought of fighting there.</p>
      <p>"Normally I get really nervous but not this time. Training’s going really well and I can't wait.</p>
      <p>"I thought I’d be really overwhelmed by the closer it gets, the more excited I am about it. I’ve got nothing to lose."</p>
      <p>Not surprisingly, reaching such a high level in the sport means she has had to make some sacrifices.</p>
      <p>That means training twice and day as well as being strict with her diet, although fortunately for Josie, Saturday's bout is at 145lbs - heavier than she normally fights at.</p>
      <p>Still, she does have to be extremely dedicated, which can take its toll on friends and family.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>"I train first thing in the morning at 6am and then again in the evening," she explains. "It is better fighting at this weight because I really love my food!</p>
      <p>"It is a lot of chicken and vegetables but I find it quite easy to stick to when I am in camp - I am able to just stick to it.</p>
      <p>"I also have dogs I have to look after so it can be difficult finding free time. Fortunately my friends and family understand when I am in fight camp and they know I am very busy and focused when I am doing that.</p>
      <p>"It is hard because I do struggle to find time to see them but they are very understanding.</p>
      <p>"My mum can’t watch though, she’d rather not know what goes on to be honest."</p>

      <p>So, what the final goal? Does she hope to forge a career out of fighting, or is she in it one fight at a time?</p>
      <p>"I just want to be as good as I can be," she answers.</p>
      <p>"I want to put everything I can into it and see how far I can go."</p>
