      <h1>'Very exciting' - What Aston Villa hero has said about potential Leeds United transfer</h1>
      <h2>Latest Aston Villa transfer news includes Liverpool midfielder James Milner's comments on potential Leeds return</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T06:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Shane Ireland, https://www.facebook.com/ShaneIrelandJournalist</a></address>
      <p>Former Aston Villa midfielder James Milner says he is constantly asked about returning to Leeds United – and admitted it would be ‘amazing’.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old is out of contract at Liverpool at the end of the season after four years at Anfield – although he is in talks about extending his stay.</p>
      <p>Milner came through the academy setup at Leeds and made over 50 senior appearances for his boyhood club.</p>
      <p>With the Whites pushing to return to the Premier League, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/milner-transfer-leeds-united-liverpool-17265659">Milner has been tipped to re-sign for them in the near future.</a></p>

      <p>He addressed the speculation in in his new book, ‘Ask a Footballer: My Guide to Kicking a Ball About’.</p>
      <p>“I get asked this all the time,” Milner said. “Any time I bump into a Leeds fan – or even my mates back home – it’s always, ‘When are you coming back? When are you coming home?’</p>
      <p>“There would be so many things to weigh up – not just for myself or my family, but for Leeds.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“If I was being released by another club, would they want me? It would be pointless for them and for me if I wasn’t needed at the time and it was just some kind of nostalgia trip.</p>
      <p>“You can probably tell from what I’m saying that I love the club, but I also love playing for Liverpool and I want to play at the highest level for as long as I can.</p>
      <p>“If my time at Liverpool came to an end and I was going to go somewhere else and Leeds were one of the clubs that were interested in me, then that would be a very exciting option for all the reasons I mention.”</p>

      <p>He left Leeds to join Newcastle United in 2004 before <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> came calling four years later to sign him on permanent deal after an earlier loan spell in the Midlands.</p>
      <p>“When I see the atmosphere at Elland Road and I hear the crowd, it makes me proud,” he said.</p>
      <p>“The fan relationship changes when you’re a professional player and you move on to different clubs, but I still follow them and look out for their scores every weekend.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Watching Take Us Home, you get a real feeling for how desperate everyone is for the club to get back to the Premier League, where it belongs.</p>
      <p>“To go back and play for my hometown club again would be amazing in so many different ways.”</p>
      <p>Milner became a popular player with Villa fans during his stay, which came to end in 2010 when Manchester City landed the former England international.</p>
