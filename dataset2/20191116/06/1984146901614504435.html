      <p>A pervert claimed to have vile images of children on his phone in order to 'stop himself sexually abusing kids'.</p>
      <p>Jordan Chambers made the comments to police when they found the sick pictures on his mobile in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/wallsend">Wallsend</a>.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old, who has past sexual convictions against youngsters, also claimed to have not been given any help for his perverse feelings while in prison, prosecutors said.</p>
      <p>He appeared at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/courts">North Tyneside Magistrates' Court</a> on Tuesday, where he pleaded guilty to three counts of making indecent images of kids.</p>
      <p>Rachael Glover, prosecuting, told the court that three pictures were found by police on Chambers's mobile phone, with one being of the most serious kind.</p>
      <p>He downloaded the photos between July 1 2019 and November 11 2019.</p>
      <p>Ms Glover said: "When interviewed about the images, the defendant explained, following previous offences, he had not received any help in regards to his sexual preferences for children and was unable to stop looking at these images."</p>
      <p>The prosecutor told the court Chambers, of Elton Street West, Wallsend, was using the sick pictures as a "coping mechanism" to prevent him having actual sexual contact with children.</p>
      <p>"He either goes out and commits offences with real children or he's got these images in his possession," Miss Glover added.</p>
      <p>"His phone is still with the police and they are in the process of doing a full download. They may be stored with iCloud, which the defendant could still have access to, even if he doesn't have a phone in his possession."</p>
      <p>Magistrates deemed that their powers in the case were insufficient and sent Chambers to <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-crown-court">Newcastle Crown Court</a> for sentence.</p>
      <p>He will next appear there on December 11.</p>
      <p>Miss Glover made an application to have Chambers remanded in custody in the meantime, claiming there was a risk he would commit further offences.</p>
      <p>Stuart Moore, defending, said: "He's currently on licence and he made full admissions in interview. He's asking for help and he's hoping, by his pleas today, that that would happen.</p>
      <p>"His wish is to get help and he won't be making an application for bail."</p>
