      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T06:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/rob-smith/" target="_blank">Rob Smith</a></address>
      <p>David Instone, who worked as a sports writer and Wolves correspondent, will appear at the Navy Club in Bellmans Yard at 7.30pm on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The talk will be followed by a question and answer session, and there will be a bar and raffle.</p>
      <p>The event is being held to support Newport's mayor Peter Scott's appeal for the town's food bank and the Newport Cottage Care League of Friends' new x-ray machine appeal.</p>
      <p>The mayor said: "Hear the history of our closest Premier League team. Special guests include Wolves legend John McAlle and others.</p>
      <p>"Tickets just £5 in advance or £6 on the door from Guildhall or Hey Jude. A night not to be missed for all Wolves and football fans."</p>
