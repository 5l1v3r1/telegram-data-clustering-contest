      <p>A fourth-quarter rally made the difference as the Orlando Magic beat the San Antonio Spurs 111-109.</p>
      <p>Playing without forward Jonathan Isaac, who sprained his right ankle on Thursday, the Magic were 99-92 behind with 4.42 left on the clock.</p>
      <p>But then Nikola Vucevic made a hook shot, Terrence Ross got a three-pointer and DJ Augustin knocked down a floater in the lane to draw the sides level.</p>
      <p>Evan Fournier then scored a three to put the Magic ahead with 2.23 left to play – a lead they retained.</p>

      <p>Their second win in a row moves Orlando up to eighth place in the Eastern Conference, while the Spurs fall to 10th in the Western.</p>
      <p>A Malik Monk three-pointer on the buzzer gave the Charlotte Hornets a 109-106 victory over the Detroit Pistons, snapping a four-game losing streak in the process.</p>
      <p>Detroit’s Langston Galloway scored a career-high 32 points, including seven three-pointers, but it was not enough for the visitors, who have now lost four in a row.</p>
      <p>The loss sees the Pistons drop to 13th on the Eastern table, while the win sees the Hornets move up to seventh.</p>

      <p>Houston’s James Harden scored 44 points as the Rockets beat the Indiana Pacers 111-102.</p>
      <p>Harden was gracious enough to say his side’s defence played a bigger part in the win than his haul, though. “It was huge,” he said. “That’s the game right there.”</p>
      <p>The Rockets have now won a season-high six games straight.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, the Oklahoma City Thunder beat the Philadelphia 76ers 127-119 in overtime, the Memphis Grizzlies scraped to a win over the Utah Jazz 107-106, the Minnesota Timberwolves lost at home to the Washington Wizards 137-116, the Golden State Warriors lost at home to the Boston Celtics 105-100 and the Los Angeles Lakers beat the Sacramento Kings 99-97.</p>
