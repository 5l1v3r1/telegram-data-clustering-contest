      <h2>The 2020 Let's Chalk About Mental Health Calendar has arrived</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T06:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Charlotte Vowles</a></address>
      <p>The woman behind October's <a href="https://www.devonlive.com/whats-on/whats-on-news/loads-people-writing-chalk-messages-3411037">Let's Chalk About Mental Health event</a> has created a cheeky new calendar-all to raise awareness and funds for mental health supprt.</p>
      <p>Let's Chalk Mental Health was created by mental health advocate, Gill Hayes, and saw people take to the streets of Devon and beyond, to write messages of support to those struggling with their mental health.</p>
      <p>Gill said: "Let's Chalk About Mental Health was a phenomenal success in terms of reaching it's objectives of challenging stigma and encouraging wider conversations around mental health and suicide. However, I wanted to do something more tangible to help people struggling with their mental health and came up with the idea of putting on a series of welll-being events from singing workshops, to yoga days, to surfing outings.</p>

      <p>"Let's Talk About mental Health was about raising awareness but the calendar is about raising cash to fund these important events."</p>
      <p>With Christmas fast approaching, Gill had a challenge to find people brave enough to pose, in an incredibly short space of time.</p>
      <p>She said: "On the morning of the shoot, I still had another 4 months to find [people for]. Just as people had been phenomenal in their support of the awareness campaign, this matter was so close to people's hearts that they were prepared to get their kit off at extremely short notice to support this project. People were arriving at work, not aware that before the end of the day I would have them posing for the calendar!"</p>

      <p>People from 12 Devon businesses and groups stripped off for the tongue in cheek calendar, including staff from The Recycled Candle Company in Exeter and singers from Devon's La La Choirs.</p>
      <p>Sam Abrahams is the musical director La La Choirs, she said many of the members found stripping off for the calendar photoshoot "Quite liberating."</p>
      <p>She said La La members truly understood the importance of mental health support as some members had been directly affected by suicide. Sam said: "We're supporting the calendar because awareness about suicide prevention is fundamental- it's important so people know they're not alone. The guys in the calendar absolutely loved it. It's great to do something fun and different to further benefit the campaign."</p>
      <p>The calendars are priced at £10 or two for £15 and will go on sale in November 20 in various Devon venues including:</p>
