      <h1>The Celtic right back dilemma Neil Lennon must solve for Rangers showdown - Chris Sutton</h1>
      <h2>Chris reckons the absence of Hatem Abd Elhamed will be a big problem for the Betfred Cup Final.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T06:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Sutton, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/chris-sutton/</a></address>
      <p>The Betfred Cup Final might still be three weeks away but <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a> is already facing his first selection dilemma after Hatem Abd Elhamed was ruled out of the Hampden showpiece.</p>
      <p>There is no getting away from the fact that the loss of the Israeli international is a huge blow for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic,</a> with the full back possibly even struggling to make it back for the derby in the league at the end of next month.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hatem-abd-elhamed">Elhamed</a> was a bit of an unknown quantity when he arrived at Parkhead from Hapoel Be’er Sheva in the summer and people who hadn’t heard of him looked at his track record and asked, "What’s wrong with him, he must be deficient in some area?"</p>
      <p>Now, after the news he’s sidelined for up to six weeks with the thigh injury suffered in the Europa League win over Lazio in Rome, fans are concerned about his absence.</p>
      <p>It was always going to be a tough task to replace Mikael Lustig and he’s a signing, for a fee of around just £1.6 million, who has made a seamless transition and been so impressive, really.</p>

      <p>Supporters aren’t slow to judge and the news of his arrival was hardly greeted with great enthusiasm from a lot of Celtic fans and it was only because of his track record.</p>
      <p>But as is the case at any club you have to prove yourself and it’s still pretty early days so let’s not get carried away. Elhamed, though, has certainly proved his versatility as he can play at right back or centre half and it looks a good piece of business.</p>
      <p>In terms of match-ups in the Betfred Cup Final I’d say defensively it’s a big loss for Celtic when you look at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> in the wide area and it looks like it might be Ryan Kent on that side.</p>
      <p>So you’d have to say it’s an advantage for Rangers that Celtic are missing their first choice and best defensive full back for such a huge game.</p>
      <p>It’s slightly premature to talk about line-ups for the Betfred Cup final but Neil Lennon has the choice of two replacements in Jeremie Frimpong and Moritz Bauer.</p>
      <p>You’d think professional football was quite an easy game the way youngster Frimpong has started his career in a Celtic jersey with really good attacking intent but we haven’t seen him seriously tested defensively.</p>

      <p>Frimpong is a fantastic athlete and it could be him or it could be Bauer who seems to be an adequate back-up - a good athlete with point to prove while on loan from Stoke City.</p>
      <p>Neil Lennon talks of having three good right backs but there’s no getting away from the fact the number one right back - the guy who had a superb game at Ibrox - is Elhamed and is a huge loss.</p>
      <p>If we’re stripping everything back then Elhamed is the more accomplished and experienced defender but that might be doing a disservice to Frimpong on the basis we haven’t seen him tested.</p>
      <p>He has been fantastic going forward and looks a really good talent and a brilliant personality but Old Firm players are judged on these big games.</p>
      <p>Ryan Kent is getting up to speed. He’s not quite at the level of last season but to be fair to him he had a turbulent pre-season in terms of his future being up in the air and then he pulled his hamstring early on at Rangers.</p>
      <p>These extra few weeks will have done him in good in terms of getting up to speed from a Rangers points of view with the countdown to the cup final well and truly on.</p>
      <p>I know a lot of fans are already fast-forwarding to December 8 at Hampden but it’s also an important spell league-wise because there is little margin for error for both clubs.</p>

      <p>Celtic and Rangers are setting a very high standard and you can’t afford a dodgy couple of games but there’s no getting away from the fact the final is huge.</p>
      <p>Every time the Betfred Cup final comes round we talk about the importance of getting your hands on the first major trophy of the season and it really cranks up the pressure on the losing manager.</p>
      <p>The winning manager will have a big sigh of relief and if it’s Celtic then it’s about whether they can win a fourth consecutive Treble.</p>
      <p>The likeliehood is they won’t because history tells us how difficult it is and the fact it’s a different Rangers this season as they have shown in the early stages in the league.</p>
      <p>They have the ability and confidence to really grind out games when they’re not playing at their peak and when they hit the form they’re capable of then, like Celtic, they’re really formidable. It’s good that Rangers are back and they are competing - it’s taken them a while!</p>
