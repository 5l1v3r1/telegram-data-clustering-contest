      <h1>The Schedule For Colin Kaepernick’s Workout Has Been Released</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T14:50:22+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 14:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matt-admin" target="_blank">Matt Lombardi</a></address>
      <p>Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who has been out of the NFL for three years, is scheduled to work out for at least 25 teams on Saturday afternoon. A short while ago, ESPN’s Chris Mortensen released the schedule for the event.</p>
      <p>Kaepernick’s workout will be in three phases. The first will be a preliminary workout, with measurables. Then it will be scripted passing with receivers. Interviews with team reps will come last.</p>
      <p>The workout is scheduled to start at 3:00 PM ET. It’s taking place at the indoor facility for the Atlanta Falcons.</p>
      <p>There’s been a great deal of confusion surrounding the event. But the biggest question is whether any of the teams in attendance will actually consider signing him to any kind of deal.</p>

      <p>Adam Schefter reports that the Falcons are supplying some personnel to help Kaepernick with the event.</p>

      <p>Kaepernick, a few months back, informed the public via a tweet that he’s continued to work out every day in the hopes of eventually securing an NFL job. It looks like he’s at least going to get a chance to show teams what he can do on a practice field.</p>
      <p>The NFL is not allowing media at the event, so we’re going to have to wait to hear the results from team scouts. We’ll keep you updated on what we’re hearing.</p>
