      <h1>ESPN’s Final Prediction For Nebraska-Wisconsin Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T14:00:11+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>There are plethora of rivalry games on tap for Week 12 of college football, which includes a showdown between Nebraska and Wisconsin.</p>
      <p>Both the Badgers and Cornhuskers have struggled in recent weeks. However, the winner of this matchup should gain some momentum heading into the final stretch of the regular season.</p>
      <p>Nebraska won’t have senior linebacker Tyrin Ferguson for the rest of the season. The football program decided to<a href="https://thespun.com/big-ten/nebraska-cornhuskers/nebraska-football-tyrin-ferguson-dismissal"> dismiss him from the team</a> on Friday.</p>
      <p>Wisconsin hasn’t looked great in over a month, but Jonathan Taylor willed the team to victory last Saturday against Iowa. He’ll try to have an encore this weekend.</p>
      <p>Taylor already has 1,259 rushing yards and 19 total touchdowns this season. Those numbers should increase this afternoon as he’ll face a Nebraska defense that surrenders 173.7 rushing yards per game.</p>
      <p>According to ESPN’s <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/game/_/gameId/401112244">Football Power Index</a>, the Badgers have an 85.8 percent chance to defeat the Cornhuskers.</p>

      <p>The Cornhuskers need a win to keep their hopes of making a bowl game alive, but they haven’t defeated the Badgers since 2012. We’ll find out soon enough if Scott Frost can pull off the upset.</p>
      <p>Kickoff for this game is at 12 p.m. ET from Memorial Stadium.</p>
      <p>Fans will be able to watch this rivalry matchup on the Big Ten Network.</p>
