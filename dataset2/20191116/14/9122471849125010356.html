      <h1>Photo: Baylor Fan’s ‘Girlfriend’ Sign Goes Viral At College GameDay</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T14:56:45+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 14:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>The college football season rolled on with a full slate of games in the Week 12 window. ESPN’s College GameDay broadcast live from Waco, Texas ahead of a huge Big 12 showdown between No. 10 Oklahoma and No. 13 Baylor.</p>
      <p>Before the game kicks off, the GameDay crew broke down all of the action coming up this season.</p>
      <p>Every Saturday as the crew gives their picks and predictions, the crowd gets in on the fun with signs. Now and then a sign pops up that takes the cake as the best sign of the day. This one had nothing to do with the actual game, though.</p>
      <p>No, one fan lamented the loss of their girlfriend.</p>
      <p>“My girlfriend breaking up with me was a quality loss,” the sign read.</p>

      <p>It’s all about quality losses at this point in the college football season. Nobody team believes that more than Alabama, which lost its first game of the season last weekend against LSU.</p>
      <p>The Crimson Tide hope their quality loss is enough to help them make the College Football Playoff. Nick Saban has never missed the playoff, but his team is on the outside looking in right now.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Baylor and Oklahoma kick off later tonight at 7:30 p.m. ET.</p>
