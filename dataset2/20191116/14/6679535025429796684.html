      <p>The student unions’ joint action committee (JAC) organised protests across the district demanding that the government shift the capital city and the High Court to Rayalaseema, on Saturday.</p>
      <p>All the public representatives’ residences were surrounded by the students in a bid to convince the MLAs and MPs to represent their concerns to Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy.</p>
      <p>The movement of students received wide acceptance among other public organisations, which also extended support to the protesters.</p>
      <p>Saturday marked the 82nd anniversary of the Sribagh pact, made by the leaders of Coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema in 1937. The pact suggests that when Andhra State would be formed, Rayalaseema people would have the right to choose between the capital city and the High Court.</p>
      <p>The students demanded that the government must adhere to the agreement made before the formation of Andhra State claiming that after bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana the State reverted to its previous status.</p>
      <p>The convenor of the JAC, B. Sriramulu, told <i>The Hindu</i> that they had split themselves into numerous small groups in a bid to protest at 16 different places covering the 14 MLAs and two MPs in the district. “We have also protested at the residences of the Ministers from Kurnool, Finance Minister Buggana Rajendranath Reddy and Labour Minister Gummanuru Jayaram,” he said.</p>
      <p>Apart from the local representatives, the students also stopped Education Minister Adimulapu Suresh, who attended meetings in Kurnool district. They gave Mr. Suresh a memorandum listing their demands.</p>
      <h3>Other demands</h3>
      <p>The students also made a slew of other demands which include the construction of pending irrigation projects, compensation for farmers who committed suicide, industrialisation of Rayalaseema and better job opportunities for the youth of the region.</p>
      <p>The students were also planning to stop the expert panel set up to study and suggest development strategies for the State, led by G.N. Rao. “When the panel comes to the district, we will without a doubt register our protests,” Mr. Sriramulu said.</p>
      <p>The students have also threatened to protest at the Chief Minister Y.S Jagan Mohan Reddy’s camp office as well as his residence if their demands were not met by the government.</p>
