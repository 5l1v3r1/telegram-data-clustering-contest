      <p>Ghanaian actress Beverly Afaglo has revealed how hard it is for her to get movie roles as a married woman. Beverly got  married to the love of her life, Choirmaster of Praye fame in 2012, and has two children with him.</p>
      <p>Beverly Afaglo explained in a recent interview with Graphic Showbiz that although she takes a lot of pride in her role as a wife and mother, her career as an actress took a big negative turn after her marriage.</p>

      <p>According to Beverly, producers didn’t consider it right for a married woman to play certain roles and that slowed her down.</p>
      <p>“Being married definitely slowed me down because some of the directors told me they couldn’t cast me for certain roles which I played previously because I’m a wife. I love that they give me such respect but as an actress, it is my duty to act irrespective of my marital status; so if I can perfectly play a role, I don’t see the reason why I should not be given the chance,” she stated.</p>
      <p>Beverly further disclosed that she also had to reject certain productions  that required her services late into the night because of her little children.</p>
      <p>“It’s not easy at all, especially when I started having babies and had to be with them all the time; yet, a director wants you on set in the evening and you are torn between your family and your work which is also fetching you money.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes, I have no choice than to sacrifice my work for my husband and children because they are my priority but now, I’m happy to say that the situation is much better since the children are older so I’m back to working full time,” she stated.s</p>
      <p>In her final statement Beverly bemoaned that she has been able to find a balance between her family and her career because she was blessed with an understanding partner who encouraged her in difficult moments.</p>
      <p>“As an actress, it is always best to be with someone who understands your work and will not frustrate you to bow to his rules in the home. If you have an understanding partner, he will help you effectively manage both aspects of your life and there will not be any disagreements,” she said.</p>
