      <h1>Video: Controversial Dunk At End Of Kansas-Monmouth Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T14:16:04+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 14:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>It wasn’t much of a contest between Kansas and Monmouth on Friday night, but the final seconds of the game were entertaining for all the wrong reasons.</p>
      <p>Kansas was leading by 55 points with under 20 seconds remaining. Bill Self’s team was more than content with dribbling out the clock.</p>
      <p>Monmouth guard George Papas clearly had other plans, though.</p>
      <p>While Tristan Enaruna was dribbling near half court, Papas came from behind and stole the ball. He went down the other end and threw down an emphatic dunk.</p>
      <p>Papas then decided to taunt the Jayhawks and unload a few choice words for his opponent – mind you, Monmouth was down by more than 50 points at this time.</p>
      <p>As you’d expect, the home crowd in Lawrence wasn’t happy with Papas at all.</p>

      <p>Some people commended Papas for not giving up on the game despite trailing by a wide margin. On the flip side, there are critics saying that he went against everything NCAA sports stand for.</p>
      <p>We’ve seen this happen in the NBA as well, but the taunting element of this is somewhat new.</p>
      <p>Following the game, Bill Self said he didn’t consider it a bush-league play.</p>
      <p>Do you think Papas was wrong for how he acted in the final seconds of the game?</p>
