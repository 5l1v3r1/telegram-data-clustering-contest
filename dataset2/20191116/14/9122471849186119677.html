      <h1>Paul Finebaum Reveals His ‘Upset Alert’ Pick For Week 12</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T14:29:31+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 14:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>Week 12 of the 2019 college football season kicked off on Tuesday with MACtion between Western Michigan and Ohio. College football has ruled every day of the week since and it continues this afternoon with a few marquee match-ups.</p>
      <p>Before the games kick off in a few hours, one ESPN analyst thinks a top-ranked program will go down today.</p>
      <p>College football analyst Paul Finebaum has one top team on “upset alert” heading into this afternoon.</p>
      <p>Finebaum thinks the Minnesota Gophers need to be careful with their trip to Kinnick Stadium for a battle against the Iowa Hawkeyes.</p>
      <blockquote>“They’ve been the focal point for a couple weeks now, but they have to win today,” Finebaum said. “I think the Hawkeyes get it done and the Minnesota dream goes down hard today.”</blockquote>
      <p>Minnesota won a huge game over Penn State last weekend to shoot up from No. 17 to No. 8 in  the College Football Playoff rankings. However, Finebaum clearly thinks the moment will be too big for P.J. Fleck’s program.</p>
      <p>Vegas thinks so as well. The Hawkeyes are actually favored by three points in the game, despite being a lower-ranked program.</p>
      <p>Minnesota and Iowa kick off at 4:00 p.m. ET. The game will be broadcast on FOX.</p>
