      <h1>Germany's Greens re-elect leadership duo after electoral wins</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T14:50:13+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 14:50</time> by <a rel="author">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Germany's Greens on Saturday re-elected the two people leading their party after strong performances in regional and European elections.</p>
      <p>And with the party polling at 20 percent or more, they made it clear they were aiming for a place in government.</p>
      <p>The 800 delegates gathered for their annual congress at Bielefeld, western Germany, voted overwhelming to keep Annalena Baerbock and Robert Habeck in place -- with 97.1 and 90.4 percent respectively.</p>
      <p>Both scores were significantly higher than the January 2018 votes that initially appointed them.</p>
      <p>The charismatic pair have been given the credit for the subsequent electoral performances, raising hopes in the party that they get to play a greater role in national politics in the future.</p>
      <p>The Congress still has to decide on who will be its named candidate for next year's legislative elections.</p>

      <p>That is expected to be between 49-year-old Habeck and Baerbock, who is 10 years younger.</p>
      <p>Both are seen as part of the more pragmatic, centrist part of the party, which is in constant tension with the more uncompromising radicals.</p>
      <p>The party's recent strong showings are at least in part due to growing concern about climate change, which many in Germany regard as a climate crisis.</p>
