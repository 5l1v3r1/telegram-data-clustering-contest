      <h1>Volkswagen's 200-HP Electric Motor Can Fit In A Duffel Bag</h1>
      <h2>Just imagine the EV swaps you could do with it.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T14:55:53+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 14:55</time> by <a rel="author">Jared Rosenholtz</a></address>
      <p>Next week at the 2019 Los Angeles Auto Show, Volkswagen will <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/volkswagen-id-space-vizzion-previews-futuristic-electric-wagon">reveal a new concept vehicle</a> called the ID. Space Vizzion. The Space Vizzion is the latest concept under VW's all-electric ID sub-brand and much to our delight, it sports a wagon body style. We still don't know if VW plans to put the Space Vizzion into production but we do know the first ID-branded vehicle to arrive in the US will be a crossover, <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/take-a-look-at-vws-electric-crossover-coming-to-america">likely called the ID.4</a>.</p>
      <p>Like the ID.3 hatchback revealed in the European market, the ID.4 should arrive with a rear-mounted electric motor delivering 201 horsepower and 228 lb-ft of torque. VW says this electric motor is extremely compact and has even released a picture of it fitting into a small duffel bag.</p>

      <p>The electric motor has a stationary stator made of copper wire coils inside it, which conducts an electric current creating a rotating magnetic field, causing it to spin. VW produces the APP 310 electric drive (named for its 310 Nm of torque) at various production sites before installing it in the ID.3. The rotor and stator, for example, are produced at the component plant in Salzgitter while the one-speed gearbox is built in Kassel.</p>
      <p>VW says the entire drive unit with the gearbox only weighs 90 kilograms (around 198 pounds) yet it generates as much power as the company's 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder used in the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/volkswagen/golf-gti">Golf GTI</a> from just a few years ago. Around 500,000 units of the electric drive will be produced in Kassel, Germany while another 700,000 will be built in Tianjin, China.</p>

      <p>Aside from its use in production VW models, we can already see a number of aftermarket uses for the APP 310 electric drive. Since the unit is so small, it would be perfect for an <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/this-high-school-class-teaches-kids-to-ev-swap-classic-vws">EV swap on a classic car</a> (VW or otherwise). Just imagine 201 silent horsepower in a <a href="https://carbuzz.com/features/finding-driving-nirvana-in-a-1984-volkswagen-gti">vintage VW Samba bus</a>. The idea sounds pretty great if you ask us.</p>
