      <h1>Paul Finebaum Predicts The Winner Of Baylor-Oklahoma</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T14:35:07+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 14:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>The biggest game on the schedule this weekend in college football is a Big 12 showdown in Waco, Texas. Baylor will try to keep its undefeated season alive when it hosts Oklahoma.</p>
      <p>Matt Rhule has done an exceptional job rebuilding Baylor’s football program. A win this afternoon would solidify his status as one of the hottest commodities on the coaching market.</p>
      <p>Even though Baylor has home-field advantage this Saturday, Oklahoma is the odds-on favorite to win this game.</p>
      <p>Oklahoma has an outside shot at making the College Football Playoff if it doesn’t suffer another loss.</p>
      <p>Earlier this morning, ESPN analyst Paul Finebaum was on <i>SportsCenter</i> to discuss the top games slated for this afternoon.</p>
      <p>Finebaum has the Sooners defeating the Bears, but he believes there is a chance an upset happens in Waco.</p>
      <p>Here’s what Finebaum had to say, via <a href="https://247sports.com/Article/Georgia-Bulldogs-Auburn-Tigers-Paul-Finebaum-predictions-Iowa-Hawkeyes-Minnesota-Gophers-Oklahoma-Sooners-Baylor-138652656/">247Sports</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“It starts today, an amazing opportunity for Matt Rhule,” Finebaum said. “Win today, you finish out and try to beat Oklahoma again. I would have a hard time imagining a committee turning them down if they run the table and finish undefeated. It would be an amazing accomplishment for Matt Rhule and the Bears.”</blockquote>
      <p>If the Bears finish the season undefeated, the selection committee would have to put them in the Playoff.</p>
      <p>There have been several skeptics out there wondering if Baylor is a legitimate contender. An upset win today over Oklahoma would certainly silence those doubts.</p>
