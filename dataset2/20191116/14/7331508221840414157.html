      <h1>NFL Week 11 upset picks: How the Jaguars can beat the Colts</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T14:48:06+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 14:48</time> by <a rel="author">Aaron Schatz</a></address>
      <p>The AFC wild-card race has developed into a very tight battle. Based on Football Outsiders' <a href="https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/playoffodds">playoff odds simulation</a>, there are currently six AFC teams with between a 15% and 55% chance of making the postseason. Those teams include Pittsburgh (5-4), Buffalo (6-3), Oakland (5-4) and three teams from the tight AFC South: Tennessee (5-5), Indianapolis (5-4) and Jacksonville (4-5). The latter two teams meet this Sunday at Lucas Oil Stadium in a game both teams desperately need to keep their realistic playoff hopes alive.</p>
      <p>If Jacksonville can upset Indianapolis this Sunday, both teams will be 5-5, but the Jaguars (36%) will have better playoff odds than the Colts (25%). If Indianapolis gets the win at home, the Colts' playoff odds go up above 50% while Jacksonville's drop below 10%.</p>

      <h3>Upset Watch: <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/jax/jacksonville-jaguars">Jacksonville Jaguars</a> at <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ind/indianapolis-colts">Indianapolis Colts</a> (-3)</h3>
      <p>You might be surprised to learn that DVOA ranks the Jaguars as <a href="https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/teameff/2019">the No. 14 team in the league</a> so far this year. They certainly don't feel like an above-average team, but they have been on a per-play basis.</p>
