      <p><b>COLUMBUS, OhioÂ (AP)</b> - The Ohio Supreme Court will hear arguments in February to decide whether a law prohibiting gun owners from carrying firearms while intoxicated should be applied inside a gun owner's home.</p>
      <p>Lawyers for a Clermont County man arrested in 2018 after he acknowledged having an unloaded shotgun while drunk say the law is unconstitutional when applied to homeowners.</p>
      <p>They say a person's sobriety or intoxication level should have nothing to do with possessing a weapon "in the hearth and home."</p>
      <p>Gun control advocates argue the safety of Ohio residents and responding police officers would be jeopardized if the court overturned the arrest.</p>
      <p>The court has scheduled oral arguments for Feb. 25. A decision isn't expected for months.</p>
