      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Mickey Carroll says his win lead to the best 10 years of his life but admits he'd probably be dead now if the money hadn't have run out</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T14:17:47+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 14:17</time> by <a rel="author">Louie Smith, Charlie Gall, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>It cost just £1 - and gave Mickey Carroll the best 10 years of his life, at least, that's what he claims.</p>
      <p>After scooping the £9.7m National <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/lottery">Lottery</a> jackpot back in 2002, Mickey, then 19, soon earned the nickname 'Lotto lout', as he spent his winnings on drugs, booze and hookers.</p>
      <p>The former binman gave £4m away to his family and then girlfriend and mother of his child, Sandra Aitken.</p>
      <p>But he admits he blew the remaining £5.7m on maintaining an extravagant lifestyle, including wild holidays to Puerto Banus on the Costa del Sol with his mates.</p>
      <p>He recalls: "We used to go to the local whorehouse because the girls there were better looking.</p>
      <p>"We'd get our own drugs first and be high on cocaine by the time we rocked up at the brothels.</p>
      <p>"I drank vodka and fresh orange, any lager, cider or whiskey, as long as it was wet. I'd wake up in some strange places."</p>
      <p>Mickey's raucous behaviour wasn't just confined to his trips away.</p>
      <p>Alcohol and narcotics were a part of his every day life.</p>
      <p>"I'd wake up, do three lines of Charlie and drink half a bottle of vodka before I got out of bed.</p>

      <p>"I was a full-blown alcoholic, doing two bottles of vodka a day."</p>
      <p>The drinking and the brothels put an end to his short marriage to Sandra, who was seven months pregnant with their daughter when his lottery numbers came up.</p>
      <p>She walked out in disgust shortly after they wed in 2003, accusing him of cheating on her with vice girls and surrounding himself with hangers-on.</p>
      <p>Mickey, who boasts of bedding 4,000 women, does not dispute any of Sandra’s claims.</p>

      <p>He says: “I spent the rest of the money on drugs and hookers, holidays and cars.”</p>
      <p>Hell-bent on becoming “King of the Chavs”, he appeared in court more than 30 times, often arriving in flash cars, swigging cans of beer.</p>
      <p>His Norfolk mansion “The Grange” was used for wild parties, and the lawn became a track for demolition car derbies. As a result, the luxury property soon fell into disrepair.</p>
      <p>He says: “It lay derelict for about 10 years. My mate’s mum and dad lived in it until I kicked them out.</p>

      <p>“I had another two houses, but it’s all gone – I sniffed ’em away.”</p>
      <p>By 2005, his accountant warned he was down to his last million and as the money dwindled, the “friends’” and hangers-on began to drift away.</p>
      <p>Enemies were also circling and one morning he found his six Rottweilers dead, their throats slit.</p>
      <p>Mickey, who was jailed for affray in 2006, says: “Gangsters sent me pictures of my family. They threatened to chop my daughter up, and my whole family.</p>

      <p>“They were dangerous guys, a Liverpool firm, so I paid them 130 grand.</p>
      <p>"They backed off for a while, then there was a bit of an altercation and the boys in London sorted it out for me.”</p>
      <p>By 2013, Mickey was broke, homeless and struggling to find work because of his reputation.</p>
      <p>He says: “I’d turn up at interviews and they’d say, ‘We just wanted to see whether it was you or not’.”</p>

      <p>He eventually followed Sandra to Scotland, moving to Moray, where he was so broke he lived in a squalid hotel for down-and-outs.</p>
      <p>He says: “It was a dive, but I had food and beer, all good.</p>
      <p>“That was 2013. I was homeless for three months. Easy come, easy go.”</p>
      <p>He worked at the Walkers biscuit factory in Aberlour before starting in a slaughterhouse.</p>

      <p>He says: “I stayed there for five years until it shut down. I do miss the slaughterhouse.</p>
      <p>"I loved it there. I’ve got my slaughterhouse licence. I’ll never lose that.”</p>
      <p>He later got his coal job and now works seven days a week.</p>
      <p>He says: “I’m a skint lottery winner. It’s got me quite a few women so I don’t mind. I’m living in a rented flat.</p>
      <p>“I’m happy. I don’t have to look over my shoulder any more, no one’s going to hit me over the back of the head and rob me.</p>
      <p>"I reckon I’m lucky to be alive. If I still had the money I’d probably be six feet under.”</p>
