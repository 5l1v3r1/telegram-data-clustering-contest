      <p>French police used a water cannon and fired tear gas in Paris on Saturday to drive back protesters marking the first anniversary of anti-government “yellow vest” demonstrations.</p>
      <p>On the Place d'Italie in the south of the city, demonstrators, many clad in black and hiding their faces, vandalised an HSBC bank branch.</p>
      <p>They set trash bins on fire and hurled cobblestones and bottles at riot police while building barricades.</p>
      <p>Two cars were overturned, a scooter and car were on fire and police responded with tear gas and a water cannon.</p>
      <p>Police said 33 people had been arrested by 10.30 GMT.</p>
      <p>Earlier, clashes broke out between demonstrators and police near the Porte de Champerret, close to the Arc de Triomphe, as protesters were preparing to march across town towards Gare d’Austerlitz.</p>
      <p>Police also intervened to prevent a few hundred demonstrators from occupying the Paris ring road.</p>
      <p>The so-called yellow vest protests, named for the high-visibility jackets worn by demonstrators, erupted in November 2018 over fuel price hikes and the high cost of living. The demonstrations spiraled into a broader movement against President Emmanuel Macron and his economic reforms.</p>
      <p>The protests lost strength in recent months, going from tens of thousands of participants to just a few thousand, but the movement’s leaders called for people to turn out on Saturday to mark the first anniversary.</p>
      <p>At its peak in late 2018, the movement grew to up to 3,00,000 people.</p>
      <p>Protests have been banned near tourists spots such as the Eiffel Tower and 20 subway stations were closed on Saturday.</p>
      <h3>Macron headache</h3>
      <p>The yellow vest movement was one of the toughest challenges to Mr. Macron’s presidency before it dwindled in the early summer.</p>
      <p>It evolved from nationwide road blockades into a series of often-violent demonstrations that pitted rowdy protesters with police and ravaged Paris and other major cities in the country.</p>
      <p>The yellow vest crisis forced Mr. Macron to make policy concessions and delay the next big wave of reforms, including overhauling the pension and unemployment systems.</p>
      <p>A survey by pollster Odoxa published two weeks ago showed nearly one in every two French people believed the protest movement might reawaken.</p>
      <p>Mr. Macron’s plans to simplify the unwieldy and expensive pension system, which he says will make it fairer, is particularly unpopular.</p>
      <p>“We have to be very careful,” one senior government adviser said of the current climate.</p>
      <p>“It’s a matter which requires prudence and compassion. Even if we didn’t have the reforms, we’d have to be careful because any little spark could quickly reignite things.”</p>
      <p>Trade unions have called on railway workers, Paris public transport staff, truck drivers and civil servants to strike against the pensions overhaul on December 5, and in some cases beyond.</p>
      <p>Students and yellow vest protesters have called for people to join forces with the unions.</p>
      <p>One slogan written on a wall on Place d'Italie on Saturday said: “December 5. Early retirement for Macron”</p>
