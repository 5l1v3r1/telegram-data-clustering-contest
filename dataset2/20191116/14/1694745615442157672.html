      <h1>Excuse My Single-Woman Tears as I Listen to Taylor Swift and Shawn Mendes's "Lover" Remix</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T14:05:03+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 14:05</time> by <a rel="author">Mekishana Pierre</a></address>
      <p>The title track from <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/Taylor-Swift-Lover-Album-Prologue-Letter-46535274">Taylor Swift's <b>Lover</b> album</a> just got <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Taylor-Swift-Lover-Music-Video-46530378"><i>that</i> much more romantic</a>, and it's thanks to Shawn Mendes. The "<a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Shawn-Mendes-Camilla-Cabello-Senorita-Music-Video-46300392">Se√±orita</a>" singer joined Swift for a supersweet remix of "Lover" that turns the ballad into a duet sure to have you reaching for someone special.</p>
      <p>"We can light a bunch of candles and dance around the kitchen, baby / Pictures of when we were young hang on the wall," Mendes croons on the single. "We'll sit on the stoop, I'll sing love songs to you / See I finally got you now honey, I won't let you fall." <i>Swoon</i>.</p>
      <p>Swift announced <a href="https://twitter.com/taylorswift13/status/1194589142841282560">the "collaborashawn" on her Twitter page</a> with a video praising the 21-year-old Canadian singer and revealing that Mendes "has taken 'Lover' and he has rewritten parts of it, which I think is so important because I love him as a writer, and I also think that everybody would write a different love letter to their lover."</p>

      <p>This isn't the first time the duo have worked together; Mendes has joined Swift on tour twice before, first during the <b>1989 World Tour</b> and more recently during 2018's <b>Reputation</b> tour. We'll be keeping our fingers crossed that the two perform their remix live during <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/taylor-swift-lover-tour-dates-and-festivals-46630008">Swift's <b>Lover</b> music festival</a>, but until then, we'll just leave the remix on replay all day long.</p>
