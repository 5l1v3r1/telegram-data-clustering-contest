      <h1>Crews work to clean up oil spill in Puget Sound near Anacortes</h1>

      <p>An estimated 19 litres of crude oil spilled into Washington’s Puget Sound Friday night during a transfer of oil from a docked barge to a Shell refinery.</p>
      <p>The spill occurred about 11:30 p.m. in Fidalgo Bay, near Anacortes on the Washington coast east of Victoria, during the transfer of about 20,000 litres of crude oil from a barge operated by Crowley Maritime Corporation to the Shell refinery. About 75 litres spilled on to the deck of the barge, with about 19 reaching the ocean.</p>
      <p>Crews from the Department of Ecology, U.S. Coast Guard, the Lummi Nation and the Washington State Maritime Cooperative — acting as incident commander for Crowley Maritime, the responsible party — are working to recover the spilled oil and minimize further environmental impacts. Shell is on scene supporting recovery efforts.</p>
      <p>Suzanne Lagoni, public information officer for the spill response team, said the source of the leak, which was a valve on the barge, was contained quickly. There will be an investigation into the cause of the incident.</p>
      <p>Lagoni said monitors at the site show no elevated levels of chemicals in the air.</p>
      <p>Most of the spill is expected to be recovered, she said. Recovery efforts will likely continue Sunday morning.</p>
      <p>Washington’s Department of Ecology said on social media that there was a crude oil sheen on the surface of the water within a containment boom — put in place during the transfer and prior to the spill — covering about 620 square metres.</p>
      <p>“We haven’t observed oil outside of the containment boom, and a second layer of protection is being added for more security,” the department wrote.</p>
      <p>Neither Shell nor Crowley Maritime could be reached for comment.</p>
      <p>Crews at the refinery dock stopped the oil transfer immediately and activated the refinery’s oil spill plan upon noticing the spill.</p>
