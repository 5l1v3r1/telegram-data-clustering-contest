      <p>Nov. 16 (UPI) -- A Texas judge ruled that a teen accused of opening fire and killing 10 people at Santa Fe High School is incompetent to stand trial, ordering him to undergo a third psychiatric evaluation.</p>
      <p>Dimitrios Pagourtzis faces 10 counts of capital murder for the <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2018/05/18/10-shot-dead-at-Houston-area-high-school-explosives-found/8831526653155/?upi_ss=Pagourtzis">May 2018 shooting</a> that left eight students and two teachers dead about 35 miles southeast of Houston.</p>
      <p>Texas District Court Judge John Ellisor on Friday ordered the 19-year-old <a href="https://abc13.com/santa-fe-hs-shooting-suspect-declared-unfit-to-stand-trial/5700171/">to be confined</a> at a Texas Department of State Health Services facility for up to four months. He also ordered a third psychiatric examination for the teen.</p>
      <p>Pagourtzis' lawyer, Nick Poehl, told the court in August that his client's <a href="https://www.khou.com/article/news/accused-santa-fe-gunman-formally-declared-incompetent-to-stand-trial/285-38aef371-1ac9-44af-902b-46a419f4996a">mental health</a> had deteriorated in the months since the shooting and that he didn't understand the legal proceedings.</p>
      <p>In February, Ellis ordered the trial, which was scheduled to begin in February, <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2019/02/28/Texas-judge-OKs-change-of-venue-for-Sante-Fe-High-School-shooting-trial/5601551386891/?upi_ss=Pagourtzis">to be moved</a> from Galveston County to Fort Bend County because Pagourtzis was unlikely to receive a fair trial in the county where the shooting happened and because of high publicity.</p>
