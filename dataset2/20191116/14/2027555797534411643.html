      <h1>Social goad may be key in reducing interest in drugs</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T14:06:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 14:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/pti" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>The presence of social stimulus reduces interest in cocaine, according to a study in mice which may lead to better intervention strategies against drug addiction.</p>
      <p>The study, published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology, said providing animals with a positive and relevant stimulus -- such as social interaction with another animal -- may reduce their preference for cocaine.</p>
      <p>The researchers, including Patricia Sampedro from the University of Malaga in Spain, studied the preference exhibited by 57 mice towards two different compartments towards which they were conditioned -- one where they were administered cocaine, and the other where the animals received saline.</p>
      <p>"After four days of observation, we detected that the animals preferred spending more time in the drug-paired compartment," Samperdo said.</p>
      <p>Next, the researchers introduced a juvenile mouse -- a highly positive stimulus for mice -- into the compartment where the animals had received saline and analysed whether they preferred spending more time in this place, or in the one where the received the drug.</p>
      <p>"We realized that most of the animals preferred spending more time in this social stimulus to exploring the context where they had received cocaine", said Sampedro.</p>
      <p>She emphasised that social interaction played a key role in reducing cocaine-seeking and the salience of the drug.</p>
      <p>The results were similar in both animal models that lived independently, and in those that lived in groups.</p>
      <p>"We carried out the same experiment but using an inanimate object as stimulus -a Rubik's cube- and, this time, we observed that the animals preferred the drug-paired compartment, which means that the social stimulus is in itself a highly relevant component to catch their attention," Samperdo said.</p>
      <p>The researchers suggest that social support is a key tool in the treatment of drug addiction.</p>
      <p>"Social interaction could constitute a valuable component in the treatment of substance use disorders by reducing the salience of the drug," the researchers wrote in the study.</p>
