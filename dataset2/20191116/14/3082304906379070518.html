        <b>Neil Harris has replaced Neil Warnock as manager of Championship club Cardiff City.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Cardiff City have appointed former Millwall boss Neil Harris as the club’s new manager on a two-and-a-half-year contract following the departure of Neil Warnock.</p>
      <p>Harris takes over with the Bluebirds 14th in the Championship after winning just one of their past six matches – a run that culminated in Warnock leaving the club by mutual consent.</p>
      <p>During a four-year spell in charge of Millwall, Harris helped the club to promotion from League One via the play-offs in 2016-17, but he resigned on October 3 following a run of seven winless matches.</p>
      <p>Cardiff said in a statement on Saturday: “Cardiff City FC can confirm the appointment of Neil Harris as the club’s first-team manager.</p>

      <p>“The 42-year-old has signed a deal at Cardiff City Stadium running until the summer of 2022.</p>
      <p>“David Livermore joins Neil in the dugout as assistant manager, while James Rowberry and Andy Dibble continue in the back-room team as first-team coach and goalkeeping coach, respectively.</p>
      <p>“Kevin Blackwell and Ronnie Jepson depart the Welsh capital with the club’s sincere thanks and best wishes.</p>
      <p>“Neil will oversee training at the Vale Resort on Monday ahead of his first City match away to Charlton Athletic on Saturday, November 23.”</p>
