      <p>Across 22 days, the powers that be granted the show’s stars Dingo Dollars which they could earn for achievements and trade for relative luxuries, often providing scant comfort in a series that compelled more than 14 million viewers to tune in at its peak.</p>
      <p>The small screen hit also saw viewers tend to vote out familiar faces from TV, with presenter <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/01/06/noel-edmonds-moving-new-zealand-shockingly-early-im-celebrity-exit-8314489/">Noel Edmonds</a> the first to be banished, swiftly followed by soap actors Malique Thompson-Dwyer, Sair Khan and Rita Simons.</p>

      <h3>Who won I’m A Celebrity 2018?</h3>
      <p>Although I’m A Celebrity had previously crowned a sporting winner as early as its second series, which was won by former cricketer Phil Tufnell in 2003, the odds were against 2019 winner <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/harry-redknapp/">Harry Redknapp</a> in a show the veteran football manager admitted he had never watched.</p>
      <p>Redknapp was the only contestant with a sporting background to enter the outback last year, but he soon charmed his newfound company and the audience, not least through his penchant for storytelling.</p>

      <p>The former candidate for the England hotseat earned all of the stars made available to him in the trials he faced during his time on the show and beat fellow finalist Emily Atack by winning almost 70 percent of the vote in the final.</p>
      <p>Speaking about his success, Redknapp told presenters Declan Donnelly and Holly Willoughby: ‘You’ve got to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/12/11/harry-redknapp-leads-pack-wife-sandra-im-celebrity-stars-begin-journey-home-8233483/">get your stars</a> to get any food and the food is not the greatest. I made so many good friends, though – it’s really been an unbelievable experience.’</p>
      <h3>What is Harry Redknapp doing now?</h3>
      <p>Although Redknapp spent almost 25 years managing the likes of current Premier League sides Bournemouth, Southampton, West Ham and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/25/harry-redknapp-predicts-tottenham-will-finish-premier-league-warns-liverpool-10983881/">Tottenham</a>, the revered manager has shown little sign of returning to the professional game.</p>
      <p>Capitalising on his I’m A Celebrity success, Redknapp has continued to appear regularly on TV – most notably in <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/03/19/im-celebrity-star-harry-redknapps-show-praised-highlighting-mental-health-8945245/">Harry’s Heroes</a>, a two-part ITV show screened earlier this year in which he trained an unfit group of former England players to take on their German counterparts.</p>

      <p>Harry’s Heroes was partly biographical, visiting Redknapp in his home and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/03/19/im-celebrity-star-harry-redknapps-show-praised-highlighting-mental-health-8945245/">telling the stories of the former professionals</a> in his hard-living, hard-playing squad.</p>
