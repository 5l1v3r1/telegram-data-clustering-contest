      <h1>Queensland advertising blitz to lure schoolies into apprenticeships</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T14:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author">Tony Moore</a></address>
      <p>School leavers and businesses are being asked to take on something big – an apprenticeship or an apprentice – as the Queensland government begins a four-month, statewide apprenticeship advertising blitz.</p>
      <p>From Sunday, the 38,000 Year 12 students who left school on Friday will be targeted to consider apprenticeships in 139 different areas.</p>

      <p>The multimillion-dollar advertising blitz is the latest stage of the Labor government's $32 million <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p52kjk.html">policy announced in August to pay businesses to train new apprentices</a>.</p>
      <p>The aggressive move comes as Queensland’s unemployment rate stubbornly remains at 6.4 per cent, well above the 5.2 per cent national rate.</p>
      <p>While Brisbane’s unemployment rate for the July quarter decreased to 5 per cent, in regional Queensland <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p531oo.html">it was in double figures in some areas.</a></p>
      <p>The government wants 60,000 new apprentices under 21 years of age in 139 traineeship areas across four years.</p>
      <p>Since August, businesses have already taken on more than 2200 apprentices.</p>
      <p>Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the timing of the advertising campaign – named "Take your future on" – was deliberate.</p>
      <p>"Right now, school leavers and their parents are thinking about the future," Ms Palaszczuk said. "The message of ‘Take your future on’ goes straight to this vital decision-making time.</p>
      <p>"And the government is ready to give young people a real good go with the quality training they need to secure employment."</p>
      <p>The campaign, which begins on Sunday and runs until March 2020, will feature heavily on Facebook, Instagram and online in areas where career advice is sought by young people.</p>

      <p>It will also feature on television, outdoor billboards, and in shopping centre displays.</p>
      <p>The program covers apprenticeships in electrical work, plumbing, engineering, health care, hospitality, early childhood education, baking, commercial cookery and hairdressing, among other areas.</p>
      <p>If a business signs up through an Apprenticeship Network Provider, <a href="https://desbt.qld.gov.au/training/employers/funding/freeapprenticeships">the Queensland Government will cover the cost of an apprentice’s training.</a></p>
      <p>It could save up to $3000 over the life of the apprenticeship for businesses, which currently fund the courses themselves.</p>

      <p>Ms Palaszczuk asked young school leavers to strongly consider their apprenticeship options.</p>
      <p>"Whenever I meet and talk with school-leavers, they often tell me about the fears they have concerning their job prospects and futures," she said.</p>
      <p>"Apprentices and trainees have always been an integral part of our state’s economy, and over the next four years, my government is committed to assist another 60,000 young people into a trade.</p>
      <p>"The statewide campaign is a call to action for employers and young people so they can hire an apprentice or start training in an apprenticeship knowing the training will be delivered for free."</p>
      <p>In October, as the latest figures were released, Queensland’s Chamber of Commerce and Industry <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p531oo.html">encouraged the government to take steps to reduce unemployment</a>.</p>
      <p>"The latest job print for Queensland is unacceptable, from both a business and economic stand point," spokesman Dan Petrie said.</p>
      <p>"This is a terrible read on the state’s job numbers where policy makers have to act to ensure every project that can be brought forward is done so without delay."</p>
