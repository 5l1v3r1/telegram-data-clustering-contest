      <p>There’s a very good reason why Devon’s children’s hospice hosts monthly open days for members of the public to come and have a look around.</p>
      <p>What you would imagine it to be like is nothing like the reality that awaits when you enter the grounds of Little Bridge House in Barnstaple.</p>
      <p>The large purpose-built property is designed to look like a big welcoming house with beautiful grounds to explore, and inside its walls is not the doom and gloom you’d expect.</p>
      <p>Far from having a clinical hospital feel, every effort has been made for it to be like home from home. The hub of the house is its large but cosy kitchen next to a lounge area, and the children’s bedrooms are made to feel cosy and comfortable with bedroom furniture and carpets alongside all the equipment they require during their stay.</p>

      <p>While most people will thankfully never find themselves having the need to use a children’s hospice, for those parents who do it is regarded as one of the most precious places in terms of the support, care and respite it provides.</p>
      <p>Little Bridge House is there for any child with a life-limiting condition to help them and their parents through their journey. It looks after around 200 children a year and more than 300 siblings.</p>
      <p>It is part of a group of three children’s hospices run by Children's Hospice South West, which was founded in 1991 by Eddie and Jill Farwell after they experienced for themselves the urgent need for hospice care for children in the South West.</p>
      <p>Their two eldest children, Katie and Tom, had life-limiting illnesses and they had to travel over four hours from their home in North Devon to Helen House in Oxford, then the country’s only children’s hospice.</p>
      <p>In 1995 Little Bridge House, the South West’s first children’s hospice, opened its doors to families from across the South West. It very quickly became oversubscribed, which led to the opening of the charity’s second hospice Charlton Farm located just outside Bristol, in 2007.</p>
      <p>In 2011, another hospice, Little Harbour, opened in Cornwall.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The aim of each one is to make the most of children’s short and precious lives by providing not just medical and nursing care to them, but enriching the lives of the children and their whole families.</p>
      <p>The services provided include specialist palliative care, respite for the whole family, a sibling service for brothers and sisters, emergency support, end-of-life care and a bereavement service for as long as is needed.  </p>
      <p>Andy Keeble, from the charity, said: “People are quite nervous when they first come to a hospice about what they will see or experience which is why we encourage members of the public to have a tour. We find that once people come here they come away with a very different impression than what they came with.</p>

      <p>“One thing people are always surprised about is it’s not clinical. It is made to feel as much of a home as possible.</p>
      <p>“People think we are here for children on that end-of-life journey, but it’s a very small part of what we do.</p>
      <p>“The idea is we offer the whole family care. They can unwind and receive as much or as little support as they need. Some parents are very hands-on and want to be involved in their child’s care while others want to use the hospice so they can do something they wouldn’t ordinarily do such as enjoying a walk along the beach or going for dinner while their child is cared for here.”</p>
      <p>The house has eight rooms for children to stay in downstairs and separate bedrooms upstairs for parents to sleep in. These have been described as like staying in the Hilton because of how spacious and welcoming they are. Although meals are provided, families also have the use of a shared kitchen and living room space during their stay to again make it feel more like a home.</p>
      <p>Most families stay either Monday to Friday or for a weekend, and the average timespan a family uses the services provided by the hospice is six years. Some then move on to adult services or receive the hospice’s end of life care.</p>

      <p>Enjoying much-needed respite this week has been the Copp family. Zoe and Gareth, both 39, live in Somerset and have four children. They visit Little Bridge House four times a year for the whole family to enjoy a much-needed break.</p>
      <p>Their two eldest children, Chloe, 19, and Oliver, 12, were both born healthy. However, their youngest two, William, 10, and Lewis, 9, have the same rare gene fault. Their condition is so rare it doesn’t even have a name and until the faulty gene was detected a couple of years ago the family had no idea what to expect.</p>
      <p>William spent the first nine months of his life in hospital and has been in and out of hospital since, just like his brother Lewis.</p>

      <p>Zoe said: “Throughout their lives it’s kind of been like just wait and see what happens. The main symptoms are breathing difficulties, they can’t walk and have not got a lot of movement, they can’t talk and all the nerves are affected, including their hearing and sight.</p>
      <p>“Lewis is affected slightly less in some areas, but has additional health problems. William is the more fragile one of the two and is close to end of life.</p>
      <p>“They are totally reliant on us. We are both full time carers which means there’s lots of things we can’t do at home.</p>
      <p>“Here we have a complete break from everything. We use the hospice to spend time with our older two children who miss out on that at home.</p>
      <p>“We see a difference in them when they come back from the hospice as they need the break too, especially Oliver as it has affected him a lot and he really struggles.</p>
      <p>“The responsibility is literally lifted off your shoulders when we get here. You feel guilty at first and it’s very hard to adjust but there are carers here to look after them and us. You are not judged or anything and it’s nice to have someone to offload and talk to.”</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Back at home, even though Zoe and Gareth have the help of some additional care support, they never get to walk out of the door together unless it’s a very rare family day out because one of them always has to be at home.</p>
      <p>Zoe said: “It’s just nice to be able to walk to town together and do normal stuff people take for granted every day when we are staying at the hospice.</p>
      <p>“It’s also time to do essential stuff like buying one of the other children a new pair of shoes. You can also have that quality time with the boys rather than just having to deal with all their medical needs.</p>
      <p>“It gives you a chance to have a proper rest which is one of the main issues we have. We get very tired and you get run down and then ill. There’s no time for us to be ill.”</p>
      <p>For Gareth, he enjoys being able to take a step back from his caring role but also get involved if he wants to.</p>
      <p>He said: “We can be involved in their care as little or as much as we want. Come the end of the week when you feel recharged again you find you miss it and find yourself getting involved.</p>
      <p>“Normally if a family has one child with a disability they have got two parents who can care for that child. But we have two children with two disabilities and also have two other children to look after and everything else on top of that.</p>
      <p>“We do get help at home, but it’s not enough.”</p>
      <p>Siblings are seen as very important at Little Bridge House as sometimes they can feel left out due to the constant care their brother or sister receives. A team dedicated to just them puts on a wide range of activities to enjoy which are either based at the hospice or weekends away.</p>

      <p>Sibling worker Nicky Jones has been working at the hospice for 15 years.</p>
      <p>She said: “It’s the sort of place that, once you start working here, it takes your heart and you can make a difference just by being here and being a friend.</p>
      <p>“You build a relationship with them, especially those who have been coming years and years. You see them throughout their whole journey.</p>
      <p>“Everyone says to me it must be depressing working in a hospice. Yes there are some very sad times, but there are still great things happening here at the same time. We make the most of every moment.”</p>
      <p>It costs £3.7m a year to keep the doors of Little Bridge House open and £10m a year for all three hospices.</p>
      <p>Of that, only 16 per cent is provided by an NHS grant and Devon’s Clinical Commissioning Group. The rest comes from fundraising which is getting increasingly difficult to reach its annual target.</p>

      <p>Community fundraiser Josh Allan said: “Our fundraising is split into two – fundraising and awareness raising. The reality is there’s lots more wonderful charities than there used to be, and money is tight, but we are lucky to live in a generous county largely.</p>
      <p>“Most of our donations are between £100 to £1,000. It’s those people who are doing things like hosting coffee mornings and schools doing non-school uniform days that really help alongside will legacies, etc.</p>
      <p>“We try to get people in here and once we show them they get it. A lot of people who live in Devon, even very close to the hospice, still don’t know we are here.”</p>

      <p>The hospice also has much more going on inside than people would imagine. It has a music room, sensory room, messy play room, jacuzzi, games room, quiet room and chapel called Doves with a special book of remembrance.</p>
      <p>Next to the chapel is a special temperature-controlled room called Star Born which is where families can go with their child once they have passed away and spend as much time as they need alone with them.</p>
      <p>Outside the hospice has a Narnia sensory garden which is very popular with families.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Head of care Tracy Freame said: “What makes us fairly unique is we offer family respite because that family time is very important.</p>
      <p>“We have a care plan for each child which has a huge level of detail. Most children can’t walk and are non-verbal so the signs are very subtle and we have a team of experts who pick up on those cues.</p>
      <p>“We pride ourselves on being responsive and caring.”</p>
      <p>If you’d like to find out more about Little Bridge House, you can book a place on a monthly tour. There are no planned family stays during these days, so although you won’t hear the usual noise and laughter that fills the home, it will give you a brilliant insight into the support the hospice offers local families.</p>
