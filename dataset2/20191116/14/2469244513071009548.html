      <p>Police and Highways officials say they are "shocked" by some of the tactics being used by drivers to avoid traffic on the <a href="https://www.devonlive.com/all-about/m5">M5</a>.</p>
      <p>There is severe congestion on the motorway after a serious crash this morning and a second crash hours later - both of which required traffic to be stopped.</p>
      <p>But the authorities dealing with the incidents cannot believe the way some motorists are choosing to handle the situation.</p>
      <p>Highways England Tweeted this shocking picture of a large lorry completely blocking both roads while trying to U-turn down a closed road.</p>

      <p>In the Tweet they said: "There is alot of congestion on the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/M5?src=hashtag_click">#M5</a> today due to multiple serious incidents.</p>
      <p>"This does not however provide anyone with the ability or excuse to go through roadwork closures, or go down the road the wrong way."</p>
      <p>Police have also shared their frustration with the behaviour of drivers.</p>
      <p>An off-duty officer for the Alliance Roads Policing Team tweeted this picture below showing drivers on the hard shoulder.</p>

      <p>The officer said: "Currently sat in stationary traffic on the M5 South due to road closure at J22 off duty.</p>
      <p>"Shocked how many people think it's acceptable to use the hard shoulder."</p>
      <p>Earlier Highways England also tweeted a picture of motorists trying to negotiate around cones to escape traffic by driving down a closed road.</p>
      <p>They shared the picture below, saying: "This action is ILLEGAL!</p>

      <p>"You are putting yourselves, our road workers and other road users at great risk!</p>
      <p>"The traffic has now been released, we ask for your patience during these stoppages."A serious crash around 6am this morning has left a woman in hospital with serious head injuries.</p>
      <p>The collision, which involved a car and a lorry, happened on the M5 Southbound carriageway between junctions 22 and 23.</p>
      <p>It is understood the A38 is also affected as traffic diverts onto the main road to avoid the motorway closure.</p>
      <p>A second crash around an hour ago left a car on its roof on the M5 Northdbound between Junctions 18 and 17.</p>
      <p>The road was blocked and traffic was stropped while police, fire and ambulance crews made their way to the scene.</p>
