      <p>One of the best musical trends to come out of 2019 is short, action-packed tracks. A lot can be done in under two minutes. When an artist utilizes their time properly, a short song can be fulfilling enough to have you running it back multiple times over. With our ever-shortening attention spans, songs can't afford to have any low points.</p>
      <p>Yung Mal's new loosie, "Started Acting' Funny", clocks in at 1:51. His verse only starts 20 seconds in, but once it does, its constant exhilaration. The Atlanta rapper has a semi-raspy vocal tone that sounds at home on haunting production. <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/yung-mal-enlists-gucci-mane-gunna-and-more-for-solo-debut-project-iceburg-new-mixtape.119528.html">His solo debut, </a><i><a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/yung-mal-enlists-gucci-mane-gunna-and-more-for-solo-debut-project-iceburg-new-mixtape.119528.html">Iceburg</a> - </i>which just dropped in August on <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/guccimane/profile">Gucci Mane</a>'s 1017 Eskimo/Alamo Records - was filled with this winning recipe. Before Mal kicks off his verse on "Started Acting' Funny", he appears to ad-lib, "I'm wearing heels right now." If this is the case, then he may have dropped one of the craziest flexes of the year. I could be mistaken, though.</p>
      <p>Yung Mal has been teasing a music video for this track, so keep your eyes peeled for that.</p>

      <p>I got big racks, I'm in the Maybach, ridin' down Melrose<br/>I used to trap in my shell toes, now I pull up at Wells Fargo<br/>I'm Louis V down to my ankle, run that shit up, got more money than bankers</p>
