      <p>When so many are struggling for connection, inspiration, and hope, Fantastic Fungi brings us together as interconnected creators of our world.  </p>
      <p>Fantastic Fungi is a consciousness-shifting film that takes the audience on an immersive journey through time and scale into the magical earth beneath our feet, an underground network that can heal and save our planet.  Through the eyes of renowned scientists and mycologists like Paul Stamets, best-selling authors Michael Pollan, Eugenia Bone, Andrew Weil, and others, we become aware of the beauty, intelligence and solutions the fungi kingdom offer us in response to some of our most pressing medical, therapeutic, and environmental challenges.</p>
      <p>This stunning documentary explores the power, beauty, complexity, and importance of the often-overlooked fungi kingdom, offering solutions to some of the most pressing medical and environmental challenges we face.</p>
      <p>Fantastic Fungi is being released in tandem with the book Fantastic Fungi: How Mushrooms Can Heal, Shift Consciousness, and Save the Planet. Edited by Paul Stamets.  The book will be on sale at the event. </p>
