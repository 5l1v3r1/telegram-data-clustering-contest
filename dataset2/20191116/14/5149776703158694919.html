      <h1>Meet the Notts couple on a 12-month European adventure in a campervan with their kids</h1>
      <h2>They plan to visit more than 15 countries</h2>

      <p>A simple trip to the supermarket could prove a challenging experience with three young children in tow.</p>
      <p>So spare a thought for <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/west-bridgford">West Bridgford</a> couple Rachel and John Day who are currently in the middle of a 12-month journey across Europe in a motorhome.</p>
      <p>The couple have been joined on the experience by their children Easton, one, Aurora, three and Savannah, five, who is being home-schooled along the way.</p>
      <p>Mrs Day, 38, who is on sabbatical from her job as a science teacher at <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/sixth-formers-work-climate-change-3536638">Nottingham Academy</a>, said: "My husband and I travelled quite a lot prior to having children.</p>
      <p>"It is something that we have always had in the back of our minds that we would do."</p>
      <p>The couple are aiming to visit more than 15 countries on their journey, which started in July, and they are currently pitched up in Portugal having toured countries including Holland, Germany and Switzerland.</p>

      <p>They have also visited Merano - a German speaking commune in Italy - and seen areas along the Camino de Santiago, a network of pilgrim paths in Spain.</p>
      <p>Mrs Day admits she had concerns about the journey as Savannah was due to start school in September.</p>
      <p>But she felt the youngster was advanced after early years schooling and added: "Social interactions was one of the key things I was concerned about, but having spent time in a school environment I thought she had those skills already.</p>
      <p>"Meeting people on the road has been great for her interaction and she is meeting children from different countries. We are doing lots of work [along the route] and she is reading and writing. We are also visiting lots of heritage sites so she is getting lots of culture.</p>
      <p>"Being put in different situations will set her up and and she will have more social skills than just the norm of going to school and being with your peers.</p>

      <p>"She is learning different languages as well. I know it is a bit controversial and with me being a teacher, but I would take my children out for another extended period as well. I wouldn’t do it during GCSE years or at crucial times, but I would do it again."</p>
      <p>It is the family aspect of the trip which was key in Mr and Mrs Day's decision to take on the journey.</p>
      <p>"You never get those years back so spending time with your children when you can is invaluable," she said.</p>
      <p>Mr Day, 38, who previously worked at the Environment Agency, added: "Travel is great but it can be intense having three children all the time, but no different to having them at home.</p>
      <p>"It’s different travelling with children but there is no way we wouldn’t do it."</p>
      <p>The family have set themselves a budget of £50 per day for the trip and they are parking up and staying in their motorhome at places which are either free or cheap. They say they are funding the trip through 'personal finances'.</p>
      <p>They are deciding where to go along the way and have described the trip as not being "really regimented".</p>
      <p>Having taken in much of western Europe, they now plan to visit Morocco at the start of 2020 and also want to take in much of southern Europe and the Balkans, with countries including Bulgaria and Romania high on their wish list.</p>
      <p>Mrs Day said: "It is just a pretty amazing life experience, it is so different and amazing to be doing it.</p>

      <p>"There have definitely been times when it has been testing but we are constantly together so it is really nice.</p>
      <p>"I am going to really miss seeing my children all the time when we go back home."</p>
      <p>The family are documenting their journey through the Instagram page, Children of Wanderlust.</p>
