      <p>Inter Milan forward <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/romelu-lukaku/">Romelu Lukaku</a> claims <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ole-gunnar-solskjaer/">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> wanted to keep him at <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a>.</p>
      <p>The Belgian joined the Serie A giants in a £74million deal in August after months of protracted negotiations with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/antonio-conte/">Antonio Conte</a>’s side.</p>
      <p>Lukaku was often shifted out onto the right wing under Solskjaer and the Norwegian made it clear that Marcus Rashford was his first choice central striker.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, Lukaku claims Solskjaer was desperate for him to stay at Old Trafford but he’d made his mind up in March to move to Milan.</p>

      <p>‘Solskjaer has my eternal respect,’ said Lukaku.</p>
      <p>‘He understood me when I said in March that it was time for me to leave England.</p>
      <p>‘I have been in the Premier League as an 18-year-old boy and now I am 26. Solskjaer wanted to keep me, but I was ready for something new.’</p>

      <p>United have struggled for goals in Lukaku’s absence, especially during Anthony Martial’s two-month absence.</p>
      <p>The Belgian on the other hand has thrived in Italy, scoring nine times for Conte’s side.</p>
