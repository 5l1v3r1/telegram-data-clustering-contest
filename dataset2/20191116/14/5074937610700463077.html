      <h1>Worawora Government Hospital gets new maternity block</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T14:30:18+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 14:30</time> by <a rel="author">Edward Williams, GNA</a></address>
      <p><b>   </b>  </p>
      <p>Worawora (O/R), Nov. 16, GNA - The Worawora Government Hospital in the Oti Region has commissioned a new maternity block to ensure quality healthcare delivery in the area.</p>
      <p>The maternity block, christened: "Mama Korankyewaa Memorial Maternity Ward," was handed over to the Hospital by Dr Geoffrey Otempong Kumi, a Specialist in Obstetrics and Gynaecology, an indigene of Worawora and Okadjakrom.</p>
      <p>The Maternity Block was built at an estimated cost of GH¢800,000.00.</p>
      <p>It has a first room, conference room, theatre, labour ward, Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) Ward, staff resting room, Kangaroo care room, lying-in ward, and private ward.</p>
      <p>Dr Kumi, also the Medical Director of Taifa Medical Centre, said the gesture was to help reduce maternal mortality.</p>
      <p>He expressed gratitude to the Management of the Hospital and the traditional authorities for their support towards the project, which started in October 2017, and asked that good care be taken of the facility to prolong its lifespan.</p>
      <p>Dr Pius Mensah, who represented the Volta Regional Director of Ghana Health Services (GHS), said highly trained and skilled human resources, adequate logistics, and health infrastructure were important components of quality health service delivery.</p>
      <p>He said the facility would help offer optimum healthcare to pregnant women and comprehensive obstetric care for women in general.</p>
      <p>Dr Mensah appealed to the Management to plan a good maintenance structure of the facility to enable it serve generations yet-to-be born.</p>
      <p>He expressed gratitude to Dr Kumi for the facility, which would go a long way to enable the GHS to deliver on its mandate.</p>
      <p>Dr Isaac Secorm, the Medical Superintendent of the Worawora Government Hospital, said the Hospital had gone through some renovations and had about 130 beds, recording a daily average of 140 Out-Patient Department (OPD) attendances.</p>
      <p>He said the old maternity block had only 17 beds with patients having to lie on the floor due to lack of beds adding that the new facility would solve most of such problems.  </p>
      <p>Dr Secorm was grateful for the establishment of the facility and pledged to take optimum care of it.  </p>
      <p>Mr Kwasi Owusu-Yeboah, Oti Regional Minister, said the Hospital had consistently improved on its performance in the Annual Hospitals Peer Review, which adjudged it the Best Facility in the then Oti Enclave 2016/17 Session, and First Runner-up in the Volta Region.</p>
      <p>He said the massive infrastructural development and the wide range of services it provided recommend it to be upgraded into a Regional Hospital.</p>
      <p>"Dr Kumi’s gesture is invaluable lesson in selfless and generous contribution by individuals to the welfare of society at large," he added.</p>
      <p>The Hospital, which started in 1951, serves as Learning Centre of the University of Health and Allied Sciences.</p>
      <p>It runs a paperless system, which reduces the congestion of rooms with patients’ folders.</p>
      <p>Among the dignitaries who witnessed the commissioning were the Biakoye Member of Parliament, the Jasikan DCE, reps of the Oti Regional Coordinating Council, the clergy, chiefs and queens of the Worawora Traditional Council</p>
