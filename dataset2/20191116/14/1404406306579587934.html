      <p>According to ESPN's Adam Schefter, a number of NFL clubs have been informed that a private workout will be held in Atlanta for Colin Kaepernick. The memo from the league read: </p>
      <p>"Earlier this year, we discussed some possible steps with his representatives and they recently emphasized his level of preparation and that he is ready to work out for clubs and be interviewed by them. We have therefore arranged this opportunity for him to work out, and for all clubs to have the opportunity to evaluate his current readiness and level of interest in resuming his NFL career."</p>
      <p>The session will include both an on-field workout and a subsequent interview. Schefter also reports that several teams have inquired about Kaepernick's readiness earlier this year. Just last month Kaepernick's reps said the 32-year-old has been "working out five days a week, for three years, in preparation to play again." </p>
