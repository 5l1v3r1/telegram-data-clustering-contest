        <b>A golden ring which once belonged to Irish playwright Oscar Wilde has been recovered nearly 20 years after it was stolen.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The ring was taken from Britain's Oxford University during a burglary in 2002.</p>
      <p>It was originally thought to have been melted down - but Dutch art detective Arthur Brand says it was actually stolen twice.</p>
      <p>It was a present from Wilde and a fellow Oxford student to their friend William Ward in 1876.</p>
      <p>The ring, thought to be worth around €40,000, bears an inscription in Greek.</p>
      <p>Mr Brand<b> <a href="https://www.afp.com/fr/infos/334/une-bague-doscar-wilde-retrouvee-20-ans-apres-avoir-ete-volee-doc-1mb5pd2">told AFP</a> </b>how the discovery came about.</p>

      <p>"Rumours started in 2015 in the art underworld that a Victorian ring has surfaced 'with some Russian writing on it'," he said.</p>
      <p>"I knew that Oscar Wilde's ring was stolen from Magdalen College at Oxford and that it had a Greek inscription on it. It could have only been the same ring".</p>
      <p>He, along with two other experts, managed to track down and negotiate the safe return of the stolen ring.</p>
      <p>But it is thought the ring also has another history tied to it:<b> <a href="https://www.newstalk.com/news/london-six-men-will-be-sentenced-over-hatton-garden-robbery-worth-millions-610245">the 2015 Hatton Garden heist</a></b> in London.</p>

      <p>The raid carried out over the Easter weekend that year was the biggest burglary in English history.</p>
      <p>The thieves used an industrial drill to break into the vault at Hatton Garden Safety Deposit and stole cash, gold and precious gems worth €18m.</p>
      <p>Mr Brand says there are "very strong indications" the ring's appearance is linked to the burglary.</p>
      <p>He also says he was given the ring right in front of the Hatton Garden Safety Deposit.</p>
