      <h1>Bayern Munich president lauds Pep Guardiola and sets sights on the 'best coach'</h1>
      <h2>Bayern Munich are pondering their managerial options and have been linked with an ambitious move to bring back Pep Guardiola from Man City</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T14:53:26+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 14:53</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>New Bayern Munich president Herbert Hainer vowed to get the "best coach for Bayern Munich" as he hailed Pep Guardiola.</p>
      <p>Guardiola has been linked with a return to the Allianz Arena after Sport Bild named him as one of three candidates to replace Niko Kovac alongside Erik ten Hag and Thomas Tuchel.</p>
      <p>Caretaker boss Hansi Flick will continue until at least the end of 2019 as the club search for their next permanent boss.</p>
      <p>They also have a new president after Hainer succeeded Uli Hoeness at Friday's AGM - and he hinted they could attempt an ambitious attempt to bring back Guardiola despite his ongoing contract with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> .</p>

      <p>"The board of directors will try to get the best coach for Bayern Munich," Hainer said, as quoted by <a href="https://www.sport1.de/fussball/bundesliga/2019/11/fc-bayern-und-pep-guardiola-hoeness-nachfolger-hainer-dementiert-nicht"><i>Sport1</i> </a>.</p>
      <p>"When I say the best, it means, on one hand, a coach who we want to have and, on the other, one who is available.</p>
      <p>"Pep Guardiola is a great coach but he has a contract with Manchester City.</p>
      <p>"For now I would say, let's wait until the board comes to us. Then we will deal with the options. But in principle, we want to have the best coach at Bayern Munich."</p>

      <p>Chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, meanwhile, explained Flick continuing as caretaker until the New Year.</p>
      <p>"Last Saturday, Uli Hoeness, Hasan Salihamidzic and I publicly announced that Hansi Flick is our head coach 'until further notice'," Rummenigge said.</p>
      <p>"And since we don't want to be asked every Saturday whether Hansi will be our head coach for the next match, I'll tell you, dear members: 'until further notice' means Hansi Flick will bear responsibility in terms of sport at least until Christmas, and potentially beyond.</p>
      <p>"[Flick has an] impressive concept of training and tactics. His handling of the players is very good, and we like his pleasant demeanour. I'm telling you with absolute conviction: We trust Hansi Flick."</p>
