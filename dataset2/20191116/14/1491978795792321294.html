      <p>Cardiff have appointed former Millwall boss Neil Harris as their new manager.</p>
      <p>The 42-year-old has signed a deal until summer 2022 to succeed Neil Warnock, whose three-year spell in charge came to an end last week.</p>
      <p>Harris, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/03/neil-harris-quits-millwall-manager">who resigned as Millwall manager last month</a>, will take charge of his first game on 23 November when Cardiff travel to Charlton. He takes over with Cardiff 14th in the Championship following their Premier League relegation last season.</p>
      <p>David Livermore has been named as Harris’ assistant, with Kevin Blackwell and Ronnie Jepson leaving the club.</p>
      <p>“I am pleased to appoint Neil as first team manager of the club,” said Cardiff owner Vincent Tan. “I have full confidence in Neil due to his principles on and off the pitch and enthusiasm to succeed. I am glad to offer him this opportunity and look forward to seeing what he is capable of achieving with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/cardiffcity">Cardiff City</a>.”</p>
      <p>Chairman Mehmet Dalman added: “Neil is a passionate manager who has all of the right attributes to take the helm at Cardiff City. I know he’s eager to get to work and we look forward to seeing him strive to get the best out of our tight-knit and talented group of players.”</p>
