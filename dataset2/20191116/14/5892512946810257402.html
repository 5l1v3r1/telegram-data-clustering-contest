      <p>Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) is just a few hours away from its upcoming UFC Fight Night 164 mixed martial arts (MMA) event, which takes place tonight (Sat., Nov. 16, 2019) inside Ibirapuera Gymnasium in Sao Paulo, Brazil, live on <a href="http://go.web.plus.espn.com/c/482924/595608/9070?sharedid=MMAMania&amp;subId1=xid:fr1573748915673hgd">ESPN+</a>.</p>
      <p>UFC Fight Night 164 will be headlined by the 205-pound showdown pitting <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/11/12/20961468/latest-ufc-rankings-update-zabit-volkov-improve-following-victories-moscow-mma">top ranked</a> contender Jan Blachowicz opposite former middleweight standout Ronaldo Souza in what marks “Jacare’s” highly anticipated light heavyweight debut.</p>
      <p>Blachowicz (24-8) has won five of his last six, three of them finishes, including last July’s brutal knockout finish over middleweight import Luke Rockhold. The power-punching Pole stands at <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/11/12/20961468/latest-ufc-rankings-update-zabit-volkov-improve-following-victories-moscow-mma">No. 6</a> in the official rankings.</p>

      <p>As for Souza (26-7, 1 NC), he’s looking to rebound from a disappointing decision loss to Jack Hermansson last April. “Jacare” has struggled in recent years, putting together a 3-3 record as he nears his 40th birthday in December.</p>
