        <figcaption>The laws on where you can park</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>As motorists, we're often left fuming as they try to squeeze their cars into tiny parking spaces.</p>
      <p>Or perhaps you're the motorist who leaves your car over the white bay lines, causing anger for others.</p>
      <p>Reversing into the bay and picking an isolated space are two of the top tips for better parking at supermarkets and out-of-town retail parks.</p>
      <p>Driving experts from LeaseCar.uk have given eight pieces of advice to help motorists remove the stress from getting their cars parked up at the shops.</p>
      <p>Other nuggets of wisdom include steering clear of the white lines that mark out the bays and considering whether it's better to be closer to or further from the store entrance.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Here are the eight pieces of retail parking guidance:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h4>1. Reverse in</h4>
          <p>It's much easier and often safer to back in to a space when you first arrive at a car park, especially if it’s likely to be busier later on. This means you’ll be able to see your surroundings more clearly when it’s time to go home, allowing a quicker, stress-free getaway.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>2. Keep it straight</h4>

          <p>Parking at a wonky angle or too close to the white lines at either side of your vehicle could leave you or a fellow shopper with a tight squeeze to get in and out of your car - or even unable to open the door altogether.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>3. Stay in the middle</h4>
          <p>Stopping your car in the centre of the parking bay can be crucial once you've finished shopping – too close to the bay in front or behind and you or another could be struggling to get potentially heavy bags in to the boot.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>4. Pick an isolated space</h4>

          <p>If you can see multiple consecutive bays are available upon entering a retail car park, don't make life hard for yourself by squeezing right up to another car - choose a central one with a vacant space either side of it to steer clear of hassle getting in and out.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>5. Use an end space</h4>
          <p>Pulling up in a bay at the end of a row improves accessibility for a car's occupants and for loading goods. It can also make parking and leaving easier and safer by providing extra space to manoeuvre your car and clearer lines of sight.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>6. Consider entrance distance</h4>
          <figure>

          </figure>
          <p>The location of a parking spot relative to the store you're using can make all the difference. Families with young children, shoppers purchasing heavy goods and the elderly or disabled should all try to get as close to the shop entrance as possible. Nervous parkers, those with large vehicles and drivers in no rush should park further away, where it's quieter.</p>

          <h4>7. Locate the trolleys</h4>

          </figure>
          <p>The last thing shoppers need after trawling around a supermarket is a long walk to deposit their trolley after loading bags in to the boot. To avoid this, keep an eye out for the trolley sheds as you enter the car park and try to park close by.</p>

          <h4>8. Choose a memorable location</h4>
          <p>If you have the luxury of lots of bays to choose from in larger retail car parks, it's wise to select a space that's near a tree, building, fixed sign or landmark so that you can easily find your vehicle after you've finished shopping. Randomly dumping a car where it could be lost or forgotten could easily lead to unnecessary distress.</p>
