      <p>CALGARY – One of the planks in the platform the Kenney government used to rise to power in the spring election was a restoration of the "Alberta Advantage," a term popularized during the Ralph Klein era.</p>
      <p>However, one Calgary school says that will never happen.</p>
      <p>The study, <a href="https://www.policyschool.ca/what-is-the-alberta-advantage-can-it-be-restored/">authored by Paul Precht at the University of Calgary's School of Public Policy</a>, says the Alberta Advantage won't ever be restored without a major energy boom to go along with it.</p>
      <p>In his paper, Precht says the Advantage came from non-renewable resource revenues (NRRRs) that ended up contributing a glut of Alberta's finances ever since Peter Lougheed was in office from 1971 to 1985.</p>
      <p>During Rachel Notley's tenure, those NRRRs dropped to just nine per cent, a fraction what they once were under Lougheed (48.4 per cent).</p>
      <p>Shortly after being elected, <a href="https://edmonton.ctvnews.ca/kenney-to-lower-business-tax-rate-to-bring-back-the-alberta-advantage-1.4420263">Premier Kenney pledged to lower taxes</a> in order to bring back the Advantage, but Precht writes that simply won't work.</p>
      <p>"Alberta’s economic booms have always resulted from high oil and gas prices, not low tax rates. Lowering of taxes did not precede Alberta’s economic booms; they always occurred during booms when operating budgets have been in surplus. Lower taxes were rewards to Albertans, not a stimulus – like dividends to citizens when NRRRs are high."</p>
      <p>He also adds many believe it is highly unlikely an oil and gas boom will ever occur, making the possibility for a return of the Alberta Advantage practically impossible.</p>
