      <p>Jeffree Star has gone all out for his 34th birthday as he celebrated with his best pal Shane Dawson in style.</p>
      <p>Did we expect anything else?</p>
      <p>The YouTube beauty guru, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/01/inside-shane-dawson-and-jeffree-stars-controversies-from-blackface-to-james-charles-feud-10819032/">who has faced controversy in the past</a>, shared snaps of donuts and flowers of every colour under the sun as he prepared for his party.</p>

      <p>Pride of place was a bright pink marijuana leaf, with the YouTuber’s cake being emblazoned with his logo.</p>
      <p>As you do.</p>
      <p>Donning a mint green suit and posing away with his boyfriend Nate Schwandt, the star looked to be having a blast as they shared a joint while their friends sang Happy Birthday.</p>

      <p>However, the day wasn’t without a spot of drama, after James Charles – who was embroiled in a feud with Jeffree after he sided with Tati Westbrook following her exposé video – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/james-charles-sister-slays-launches-youtube-beauty-influencer-competition-50000-prize-11165961/">launched his makeup competition series on the same day.</a></p>

      <p>Bit awkward.</p>
      <p>The influencer will be laying down his skills, expertise and all the sass, to uncover the next big thing in the beauty world – who will take home a $50,000 (£38,000) prize.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/shane-dawson-accused-copping-shortening-jeffree-star-series-removing-james-charles-drama-11089804/">Shane Dawson looked to be shrugging off the backlash</a> over his latest series with Jeffree after he was accused of ‘copping out’.</p>

      <p>Following the launch of his Conspiracy eyeshadow palette, Shane said he felt like he was ‘done’ with the series, admitting he had lots of footage he hadn’t used.</p>
      <p>More recently, he revealed there will be one more episode, saying: ‘Working on the last epsiode of the jeffree series now. i don’t wanna give a day cause i don’t wanna disappoint anyone if it’s not ready in time but just know me and andrew are working our hardest to make it good and to end it right.’</p>

      <p>While it’s not clear what exactly the final episode will show, the original plan was for a nine-episode series and the trailer showed a lot more than we’ve currently seen (including Shane’s reaction to the James and Tati Westbrook drama).</p>
      <p>Although some fans were still optimistic about the series, others slammed him, branding the episodes ‘nothing more than a huge promotion for your palette.’</p>
