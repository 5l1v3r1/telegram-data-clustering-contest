      <p>When people think of New York City, they often envision the hustle and bustle of Manhattan; however, the brownstones dotting the tree-lined streets of Brooklyn are famous in their own right. These romantic, historic structures <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/brooklyn-brownstone-historic-street-writers">have housed notable writers</a> such as Truman Capote, Arthur Miller, Truman Capote, and Hart Crane. While brownstones exist all over New York, the majority of them can be found in Brooklyn neighborhoods such as Brooklyn Heights, Fort Greene, Park Slope, and Bed-Stuy.</p>

      <p>They don’t call Oxford the “<a href="http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryMagazine/DestinationsUK/Oxford-City-of-Dreaming-Spires/">City of Dreaming Spires</a>” for nothing. Home to one of the world’s most famous universities, Oxford’s streets are studded with <a href="https://www.oxford-royale.co.uk/articles/8-beautiful-architecture-oxford.html">every major architectural style</a> of buildings in England, ranging from the Saxons to the present day.</p>
