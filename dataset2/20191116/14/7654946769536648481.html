      <h1>Trump’s Doral resort was added as possible G-7 site at last minute, secret service email reveals</h1>

      <p>President Trump’s Doral resort was added to the list of finalists for next year’s Group of Seven summit after the Secret Service had already narrowed down the search to four finalists, a Secret Service email <a href="https://www.citizensforethics.org/secret-service-docs-contradict-trump-doral-g-7/">released late Friday</a> shows.</p>
      <p>“Our original itinerary included Hawaii, Utah, California and North Carolina,” a Secret Service official wrote, describing a trip that a team of Secret Service personnel took in July to examine the finalists, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trumps-doral-resort-was-a-last-minute-addition-in-search-for-g-7-site-newly-released-email-shows/2019/11/15/f39056a0-07fa-11ea-8ac0-0810ed197c7e_story.html">The Washington Post reported</a>. “By departure, they had already cut two (California and North Carolina) and added Miami on the back end.”</p>
      <p>Miami referred to the financially troubled Doral resort near the Miami airport, which wasn’t among the original 10 sites the Secret Service started looking at in late May. The official wrote on July 12 that “yesterday was the first time we put eyes on this [Doral] property.”</p>
      <p>The email was released to the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which made a public-records request and then sued when government agencies did not comply.</p>
      <p>The White House<a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/17/trump-to-host-next-g-7-summit-at-his-national-doral-resort/"> announced in October </a>that Doral would host the gathering of the leaders of the world’s largest economies. When Trump nixed the plan a few days later, he blamed that Democrats, the “fake news media” and the Constitution’s “<a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/21/trump-blasts-phony-emoluments-clause-amidst-doral-g-7-controversy/">phony emoluments clause</a>” for forcing his hand, despite his pledge to <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/21/trump-i-wouldve-hosted-g7-at-florida-resort-for-free/">host the summit for free</a>.</p>
