      <h1>Cowboys Player Calls The NFL “Soft” After Myles Garrett Incident</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T14:07:01+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 14:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>We’re over 24 hours removed from Thursday night’s game between the Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers. However, the only headlines still revolve around what occurred between Myles Garrett and Mason Rudolph.</p>
      <p>The star defensive end received an indefinite suspension after <a href="https://thespun.com/nfl/afc-north/cleveland-browns/video-myles-garrett-ejected-after-swinging-helmet-at-mason-rudolph">ripping Rudolph’s helmet off and hitting him with it</a>. Rudolph only received a fine for his role in the brawl – which led to outrage among fans and players.</p>
      <p>On Friday, a current player called out the NFL for being “soft.”</p>
      <p>Dallas Cowboys defensive end Robert Quinn made it clear he’s not happy with the emphasis on defensive penalties in the NFL.</p>
      <p>Here’s what he had to say, via <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/sports/cowboys/2019/11/16/cowboys-de-robert-quinn-says-the-nfl-is-becoming-charmin-soft/">Dallas Morning News</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“You got to play full speed, they going to throw the flag. They going to throw the flag. They make so many rules changes, who knows what they’re going to call nowadays? So you just play and hope it doesn’t get to that point. Take it back to 1960 there was only two rules: score and stop them from scoring. Man up. But nowadays you can’t do that. Charmin, in a sense. Charmin. Soft. Tissue.”</blockquote>
      <p>The NFL placed an emphasis on player safety, which naturally lends itself to offensive players.</p>
      <p>That doesn’t mean the NFL has done a great job officiating – especially this season.</p>
