      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T14:18:51+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 14:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/south-south-regional/363517-its-a-sad-day-gov-dickson-says-of-bayelsa-election.html" target="_blank">Cletus Ukpong</a></address>
      <p>The Bayelsa governor, Seriake Dickson, sounded negative about the ongoing governorship election in the state, when he spoke with reporters about the general conduct of the election.</p>
      <p>“Gentlemen of the press, today is a sad commentary on our nation’s democracy,” Mr Dickson said to reporters around 12:20 p.m at his Polling Unit 5, Ward 2, Sagbama, as he arrived to cast his vote.</p>
      <p>He was accompanied by his wife and some aides.</p>
      <p>“As we are speaking, in this day and age, gun-wielding militiamen, with the aid of security forces, have overrun hapless electoral officials.</p>
      <p>“Most of the electoral officials in Southern Ijaw, as we speak, are kidnapped and held hostage.”</p>
      <p>Mr Dickson said election did not take place in Southern Ijaw, except Amassoma.</p>
      <p>He said, “Everyone knows APC has no structure in Bayelsa to win an election, but they have armed militias, surveillance contractors, who kill and maim for APC.</p>
      <p>“They also have the Nigerian army and rogue elements in the police force, working in concert with them to deny the citizens their right to vote.</p>
      <p>“This has been the lots, this has been what we have been managing since 2015, with the APC at the centre is not caring about the dignity of our people.”</p>
      <p>The governor accused the APC federal government of being “too hungry” to make Nigeria a one-party state.</p>
      <p>He described himself as a “man of peace” who would always stand for peace and respect for human dignity.</p>
      <p>The governorship election is not yet over in the state, as voting is still going on at some polling units were election materials arrived late.</p>
