        <p>“My body feels well currently. I don’t feel pain anywhere. I feel fresh, honestly. After having a long, difficult match like this, I feel like I can go out and play tomorrow the same way. So I don’t have any problem with that,” Stefanos Tsitsipas said after the round robin stage finished.</p>
        <p>While Federer added: “I’m happy to stick around. Hopefully [I can] go a step further than I did last year. I played a good match against Zverev last year, but he was unreal last year, so that was tough.”</p>
