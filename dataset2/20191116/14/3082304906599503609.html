        <b>Authorities in Italy have been informed after Inter received a letter containing threats with reference to coach Antonio Conte.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Inter received a letter containing threats against head coach Antonio Conte and have informed the relevant authorities, the club confirmed in a widely distributed statement.</p>
      <p>Reports claimed the letter, which arrived at Inter’s headquarters in Milan, contained a bullet along with references to the former Chelsea boss.</p>
      <p>Inter are second in Serie A following a five-game unbeaten run, including victories in their last three league matches.</p>
      <p>The club’s statement contradicted some reports that indicated the letter was sent directly to Conte.</p>
      <p>“In relation to the news published today, Antonio Conte has not personally received any threatening letter,” the statement said.</p>
      <p>“Consequently, he did not go in person to file a complaint.</p>
      <p>“It was the club that received a letter and, as per the practice in this kind of situation, proceeded to contact the competent authorities.”</p>
      <p>Inter’s next fixture sees them travel to Torino for a Serie A clash on November 23.</p>
