      <p>Ricky Hatton has been criticised for donning an X-rated fancy dress costume at a Benidorm family festival.</p>
      <p>The former boxer is at the popular Spanish destination during its fiesta season.</p>
      <p>The former welterweight - who once fought Floyd Mayweather - got involved in the annual British Fancy Dress Day celebrations during his trip.</p>
      <p>But Hatton has sparked a backlash after donning a jockey costume for the event, with a giant, sequin laden penis hanging in front.</p>
      <p>The post was shared on a Benidorm Facebook page, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/boxing/ricky-hatton-criticised-explicit-fancy-20893826">the Mirror reports</a> , with many criticising the 'bad taste' outfit.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>One said: "It's a bit much when there's kids around.''</p>
      <p>Back at home, Ricky is currently working with Love Island star Tommy Fury on his return to boxing.</p>
      <p>Tommy - the younger brother of Tyson - will make his return to the ring on December 12 and trains at Ricky's gym in Hyde, in Manchester.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The 41-year-old wasn't the only one having a great time as thousands of revellers descend on the resort every year to take part in the November celebrations.</p>
