        <b>Following his induction as Bayern Munich president, Herbert Hainer gave a warm endorsement of Pep Guardiola’s managerial abilities.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bayern Munich’s new president has praised Pep Guardiola and vowed the club will target the best possible candidate for the vacant head coach position.</p>
      <p>Herbert Hainer formally succeeded Uli Hoeness as president at Friday’s AGM, assuming the role amid the search for a full-time replacement for Niko Kovac.</p>
      <p>Hansi Flick will continue in a caretaker capacity for at least the rest of 2019 while the Bundesliga champions weigh up their options.</p>
      <p>Guardiola – along with Erik ten Hag and Thomas Tuchel – is one of three men being considered, according to Sport Bild, and Hainer has great respect for the Catalan, whose contract with Manchester City runs until 2021.</p>
      <p>“The board of directors will try to get the best coach for Bayern Munich,” Hainer said, as quoted by Sport1.</p>
      <p>“When I say the best, it means, on one hand, a coach who we want to have and, on the other, one who is available.</p>
      <p>“Pep Guardiola is a great coach but he has a contract with Manchester City.</p>
      <p>“For now I would say, let’s wait until the board comes to us. Then we will deal with the options. But in principle, we want to have the best coach at Bayern Munich.”</p>

      <p>Guardiola spent three seasons in charge of Bayern before leaving for Premier League side City in 2016.</p>
      <p>The Bavarians won three Bundesliga titles and lifted the DFB-Pokal twice during his time at the helm.</p>
