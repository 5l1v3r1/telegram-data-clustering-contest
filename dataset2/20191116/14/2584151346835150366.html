      <h1>Yellow Jacket protests mark a year of anger</h1>
      <h2>Their numbers are smaller but protesters are still wreaking havoc in Paris on their 53rd weekly demonstration.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T14:54:50+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 14:54</time> by <a rel="author">Sarah Wheaton</a></address>
      <p>A diminished Yellow Jackets movement showed it was nonetheless determined to make citizen anger felt in the streets of Paris as it marked the one-year anniversary of its first protest.</p>
      <p>The interior ministry <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2019/11/16/les-gilets-jaunes-veulent-rallumer-la-flamme-un-an-apres-leurs-debuts_6019430_3224.html">estimated</a> 4,700 protestors assembled in the French capital Saturday, a far cry from the hundreds of thousands who in earlier weeks swarmed into cities and towns around France from the countryside to protest rising fuel costs.</p>
      <p>However, Action 53 — marking the 53rd weekend of protests — had the same hallmarks of destruction and clashes with police as earlier demonstrations. By early afternoon Saturday, Paris’ Place d’Italie was in flames, a section of the city’s peripheral highway had been momentarily blocked and police had arrested several dozen protesters, including one of the founding activists, Thierry Paul Valette, according to <a href="https://www.bfmtv.com/societe/en-direct-1er-anniversaire-des-gilets-jaunes/?liveanchor=4aec3f86f83a01623acac49bb187f516#4aec3f86f83a01623acac49bb187f516">BFMTV</a>. By 8 p.m. police <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2019/11/16/les-gilets-jaunes-veulent-rallumer-la-flamme-un-an-apres-leurs-debuts_6019430_3224.html">reported</a> 147 had been arrested.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, authorities <a href="https://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/gilets-jaunes-a-paris-les-stations-de-metro-fermees-dimanche-17-novembre-20191117">closed multiple metro stations</a> in anticipation of further action.</p>
      <p>After launching in November 2018, protesters took to the streets weekly — and while their numbers gradually sagged, they had a concrete impact.</p>
      <p>As their rampages scared off tourists and impinged on the Christmas 2018 shopping season, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire in December said they were creating an “<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/gilets-jaunes-french-finance-minsters-yellow-jacket-protests-are-an-economic-catastrophe/">economic catastrophe</a>,” and President Emmanuel Macron withdrew his plans for a carbon tax, the original impetus for the protests. Five months later, he announced a “<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/emmanuel-macron-launches-national-debate-in-response-to-yellow-jackets-protests/">national debate</a>” to collect public opinion on matters like taxation, public services and shifting toward a greener economy.</p>
      <p>“This period has changed me,” Macron told reporters in April as he <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/emmanuel-macron-speech-yellow-jackets-response-tax-cuts-reform/">announced</a> a series of reforms aimed at addressing some Yellow Jacket anxieties, while rejecting core demands like a new tax on the rich.</p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://www.bfmtv.com/societe/sondage-bfmtv-63percent-des-francais-ne-souhaitent-pas-un-regain-de-mobilisation-des-gilets-jaunes-1805320.html">poll published Wednesday</a>, 55 percent of respondents generally support the Yellow Jacket protests. However, a greater proportion, 66 percent, don’t want to see the demonstrations ramp up again.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, protesters <a href="https://www.francetvinfo.fr/economie/transports/gilets-jaunes/direct-gilets-jaunes-forte-mobilisation-attendue-pour-l-anniversaire-du-mouvement_3705639.html">headed toward the Place de la Bastille</a>, while firefighters dodged projectiles as they responded to flames at the Place d’Italie — police barred a march slated to begin from the roundabout, citing violence. Hundreds of other actions took place around the country, involving an estimated 28,000 people in total.</p>
      <p>Distrust between police and citizens is one of the legacies of the Yellow Jacket protests, said David Le Bars, head of the French police commissioners’ union.</p>
      <p>“Nothing will be like before in the relationship between the police and a certain part of the population,” Le Bars <a href="https://www.francetvinfo.fr/economie/transports/gilets-jaunes/gilets-jaunes-plus-rien-ne-sera-comme-avant-entre-les-policiers-et-la-population-regrette-un-commissaire_3705617.html">told Franceinfo</a> on Saturday. “Parts of society are about to fracture.”</p>
