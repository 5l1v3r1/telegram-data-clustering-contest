      <h1>Rating every West Ham transfer made by Manuel Pellegrini and Mario Husillos</h1>
      <h2>The Hammers transfer duo, who have worked together for some time, have certainly spent the club's money over the past 15 months</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T14:45:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 14:45</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Inkersole</a></address>
      <p>Manuel Pellegrini and West Ham director of football Mario Husillos have broken the club's transfer record three times in 12 months as they assembled a squad they believed capable of qualifying for Europe.</p>
      <p>It didn't quite pan out last season as the Hammers eventually finished in tenth place having spent big on the likes of Issa Diop and Felipe Anderson, who was the club's record signing for just a year.</p>
      <p>That was smashed this summer by the £45m capture of Sebastien Haller from Eintracht Frankfurt after the club sold Marko Arnutovic to Shanghai SIPG and then missed out on number one target Maxi Gomez. That said, the signing of Haller has more than put any frustrations over losing out to Valencia for Gomez to the backburner.</p>
      <p>It's not quite gone to plan so far this season however. After a good start, the Hammers have slid down to 16th in the standings having not won in six games.</p>
      <p>That has seen Husillos come under some fire for the signings he has made, particularly this past summer. Both Roberto and Pablo Fornals have struggled to get going in claret and blue, Roberto has been a bit of a disaster, while Haller has just one goal since August.</p>
      <p>Pellegrini and Husillos have worked together for many years, Pellegrini insisted his Argentine mate be appointed as a director of football when he took the manager job, and the latter has been hailed in some quarters for the business he and Pellegrini have done so far - at a big cost.</p>
      <p>The duo splashed out £90m in the summer of 2018 and the best part of £75m in 2019 in order to build the squad that they have now. But how have those they brought in fared?</p>
      <h3>18/19</h3>
      <h4>Ryan Fredericks</h4>

      </figure>
      <p>The right back arrived on a free transfer from Fulham though wasn't technically a Pellegrini/Husillos signing as an agreement was already in place before the duo were appointed.</p>
      <p>After initially struggling with form and fitness issues, Fredericks has been excellent in 2019/20 and has nailed down the right back spot.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Grade: C</b>
      </p>
      <h4>Lukasz Fabianski</h4>
      <p>The bargain of the last few windows? Perhaps. At just £7m, Fabianski's signing from Swansea has been an absolute steal as he earned Hammer of the Year plaudits for last season thanks to some excellent displays. West Ham wouldn't have finished tenth in 18/19 without him.</p>
      <p>Started as he finished this season but is currently on the sidelines with a hip injury and he has been sorely, sorely missed.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Grade: A</b>
      </p>
      <h4>Issa Diop</h4>
      <p>The Frenchman was the first signing under Pellegrini to break the club transfer record for an initial £22m rising to £25m after earning a big reputation at Toulouse in France.</p>
      <p>Diop was thrown in at the deep end and responded well, looking the real deal despite the Hammers struggling for clean sheet. His form tailed off towards the latter stages of last season and was dropped for three games before returning.</p>
      <p>This season, he's looked a bit jumpy and not on the level he was last year, admittedly alongside a new partner in Angelo Ogbonna and subsequently Fabian Balbuena. A France international call-up is not far off however. He was linked with a big money move to Man Utd this summer but it was never a starter.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Grade: B-</b>
      </p>
      <h4>Andriy Yarmolenko</h4>
      <p>Signed from Borussia Dortmund for £17.5m, the move came out of nowhere as the club quickly closed a deal for the winger. He started well before seeing his 18/19 season completely wiped out after an achilles injury last October.</p>
      <p>He's bounced back with a bang so far this season, scoring three goals so far this campaign and is the cliché "like a new signing" for Pellegrini.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Grade: C</b>
      </p>
      <h4>Jack Wilshere</h4>
      <p>Pellegrini wanted to give Wilshere a three-year, £100,000 a week deal but the Hammers hierachy only wanted to give a one-year deal thanks to Wilshere's injury issues - Pellegrini won out, but it's backfired.</p>
      <p>Wilshere made just eight appearances in his first season in east London before two ankle injuries ruled him out for most of the season.</p>
      <p>After a good pre-season ahead of 19/20, Wilshere has failed to kick on and hasn't started a Premier League game since the second match of the campaign. He's injured again as well, which sums up his Hammers career so far.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Grade: D</b>
      </p>
      <h4>Felipe Anderson</h4>

        <figcaption>Felipe Anderson was West Ham's record signing<cite>(Image: West Ham United/Getty Images)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>After not scoring in his first ten appearances following his £42m move from Lazio and being booed off against Spurs in the Carabao Cup, Anderson went on a tear and netted seven goals in nine games in late 2018 to lead to claims he was the best player outside of the top six clubs.</p>
      <p>He's too inconsistent. World class on his day but can be frustrating as anything in equal measure. There is far too much potential in the Brazilian to give up on him but he constantly leaves us wanting more as we know its there.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Grade: C</b>
      </p>
      <h4>Fabian Balbuena</h4>
      <p>The Paraguayan established himself as a first choice centre back last season and his £4m fee from Corinthian looked like a complete steal last season, which was interrupted briefly by a knee injury.</p>
      <p>2019/20 has been different though as he was axed following the 5-0 thumping by Man City and Pellegrini admitted he shouldn't have played opening weekend and has since lost his spot to Angelo Ogbonna. He's got his spot back but hasn't looked anywhere near as good as he did last season.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Grade: C</b>
      </p>
      <h4>Carlos Sanchez</h4>
      <p>The Colombian midfielder was s surprise signing, if only as a backup player to Declan Rice especially considering Pedro Obiang was at the club.</p>
      <p>Sanchez committed a huge error against Wolves last season to underline where there were concerns about his signing. He's not going to displace Rice, he never was, but is highly unlikely to be staying beyond the end of his contract next summer. If the club could get a fee for him in January then they'll probably take it.</p>

        <b>Grade: E</b>
      </p>
      <h4>Lucas Perez</h4>
      <p>The Spaniard was a deadline day signing last summer and much more was expected of him than what we got - not that he was given much of a chance.</p>
      <p>Constant questions over his attitude never went away but when Perez did play, usually as a substitute, he did have an impact and scored six times in 19 appearances in claret and blue.</p>
      <p>But the club were never really convinced by him and he was sold to Alaves this past summer where he has found form, scoring in eight successive games.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Grade: D</b>
      </p>
      <h4>Xande Silva</h4>
      <p>The youngster was signed for the Hammers U23 setup but played so well, scoring seven goals in his first six PL2 appearances for the U23s and earning a promotion to the first team squad, debuting away at Burnley and making his first start in the FA Cup win over Birmingham.</p>
      <p>However, serious hernia injury and then undergoing emergency surgery for a bowel obstruction this summer has seen his career in east London stall. He's working his way back to fitness and is expected to push for first team honours once again.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Grade: C-</b>
      </p>
      <h4>Samir Nasri</h4>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>West Ham midfielder Samir Nasri battles with Manchester City's defender Vincent Kompany<cite>(Image: OLI SCARFF/AFP/Getty Images)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>He was the solitary signing in the January transfer window of last season and that was as a free agent after he completed his doping ban.</p>
      <p>Nasri struggled with injury throughout his short stay in east London though he did show glimpses that he still had a certain something on the pitch. We just didn't see it very much.</p>
      <p>He was released earlier this summer after the club didn't bow down to his wage demands.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Grade: E</b>
      </p>
      <h3>19/20</h3>
      <h4>Roberto</h4>
      <p>A free agent signing and the first to arrive this summer, Roberto has been thrust into the spotlight after the injury to Lukasz Fabianski. He looked shaky in pre-season and had plenty of chances to impress, but didn't.</p>
      <p>Having replaced the injured Fabianski, Roberto has demonstrated he is a good shot stopper by making 31 saves in six games. But, he's committed a couple of atrocious gaffes and has come under enormous fire, making his defenders nervous and as a result, the Hammers have been losing games. He's not the only problem, but is certainly a part of it.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Grade: E</b>
      </p>
      <h4>David Martin</h4>
      <p>The former Millwall keeper has yet to feature competitively for the first team.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Ungraded</b>
      </p>
      <h4>Pablo Fornals</h4>
      <p>A bit of a disappointment so far as the Spaniard takes his time to settle into the Premier League following a £25m move from Villarreal. It seems Pellegrini doesn't quite know where to use Fornals just yet, either as a ten or playing off the right.</p>
      <p>He's shown glimpses but nothing to set the world on fire just yet. You suspect there is more to come from Fornals and he will get better as the season goes on but he needs to start finding his feet.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Grade: D</b>
      </p>
      <h4>Sebastien Haller</h4>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>West Ham's club record recruit Sebastien Haller</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>He is the new club-record signing after a £45m from Eintracht Frankfurt and has looked the part so far, scoring four goals in seven appearances. He's not the game changer that Marko Arnautovic was, who could change a game by himself, but that's not Haller's game.</p>
      <p>He's equally adept at brining others into play as he he is scoring goals. Has scored just once since August though and has looked a bit shot of confidence and ambition in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Grade: B</b>
      </p>
      <h4>Goncalo Cardoso</h4>
      <p>Yet to feature for the first team but was on the bench for the Carabao Cup defeat to Oxford United following his move from Boavista.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Ungraded</b>
      </p>
      <h4>Albian Ajeti</h4>
      <p>An £8m deadline day signing from Basel, Ajeti's signing has looked an odd one so far as he's not gained he trust of Pellegrini.</p>
      <p>He's started to get more minutes off the bench in recent weeks but is still to start in the top flight. He's ypung and adapting too but yet to get off the mark for his new employers.</p>
