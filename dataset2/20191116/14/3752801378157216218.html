      <p>KwaZulu-Natal police have arrested seven men after a woman was handed a safe full of fake money in an apparent scam.</p>
      <p>In March a woman was allegedly convinced by the suspects to resign from her job and hand over her savings, which the suspects would then invest on her behalf for "massive returns", explains provincial police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele.</p>
      <p>When the woman was handed a safe, expecting to receive the return on her investment, she instead found it to contain counterfeit money and papers, Mbele says.</p>
      <p>Following the incident, a case of theft was opened at Ladysmith Police Station for investigation.</p>
