      <p>Chimchar’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/pokemon-go/38713"><i>Pokémon Go</i></a> Community Day will take place on <b>Nov. 16 from 11 a.m. until 2 p.m. in your local time zone</b>.</p>
      <p>During this time, Chimchar will spawn in abundance and they’ll have an increased chance to appear Shiny.</p>
      <h3>How do I get a Shiny Chimchar?</h3>
      <p>Just loitering around during the Community Day time period should net you at least one Shiny Chimchar. Simply tap all the Chimchar you see to check and make sure you don’t miss your chance on grabbing a pink monkey. After the Community Day is over, Chimchar will be added to the Shiny pool and will be able to be caught and hatched, but at a dramatically lower rate.</p>

      <h3>What’s the Community Day move for it?</h3>
      <p>Like the other fire-type starter Pokémon, Chimchar learns <b>Blast Burn</b>. Infernape with Blast Burn isn’t super meta-relevant, as it’s not as great as Blaziken, Chandelure, or Moltres, but if you have none of those, it’ll make a fine substitute. Evolve your Monferno up to a Infernape from 11 a.m. until 4 p.m. in your local time in order to get the move.</p>
      <h3>How do I make the most of this Community Day?</h3>
      <p>This Community Day has decreased egg hatch distance throughout the event, so load up on Incubators and hatch a bunch of eggs. Like every other Community Day, Lures will also last three hours, so plunk a couple of those down in your local spots to increase the Chimchar spawn.</p>
      <p>For the best Infernape, you should make sure it has <b>Fire Spin</b> and <b>Blast Burn</b> as its moves.</p>
      <p>If you’re deciding which Chimchar to evolve at the end of the day, try using one of the new search strings. Sort your ‘mons by “recent” using the lower right icon, then type “4*” in the search box at the top. This will let you know if you have any 100% IV Chimchar. Most people won’t be so lucky, so next you’ll want to type “3*” in the search box, which will show you any recent ‘mons that are 80% or above. Appraise these to see which one is best and then evolve your new buddy!</p>
