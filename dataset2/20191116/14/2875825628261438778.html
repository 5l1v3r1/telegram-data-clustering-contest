      <p>Mary Black has opened up about her experiences of postnatal depression, reminding people “there is light at the end of the tunnel”.</p>
      <p>Following the traumatic birth of her first child, Conor, the beloved singer said she did not feel well in herself, but thought she was simply feeling a bit down in the dumps.</p>
      <p>It was only after seeking help that Mary, who is also mum to Danny and Roisin, realised she could be happy and smile again.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Ryan Tubridy on the RTE Late Late Show on Friday night, Mary, 64, said: “It was postnatal depression and it’s a very frightening thing because nobody put a name on it.</p>

      <p>“This was more than 30 years ago - he’s 38 now so it was 37 years ago - and postnatal depression or any sort of depression was never talked about.”</p>
      <p>The singer, whose latest album, No Frontiers, was released in September, said: “And I think, having gone through it that first time - and I did get well shortly after - it was the fear of never being able to smile or be happy again.</p>

      <p>“I think the first time anyone is feeling depression - and I’ll say this to anyone out there that’s feeling bad - there is light at the end of the tunnel. It did happen to me again but it wasn’t as frightening because I felt, I was okay before, there is light and I’ll come back around.”</p>
