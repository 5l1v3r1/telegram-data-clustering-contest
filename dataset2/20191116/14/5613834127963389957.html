      <h1>‘Resident Evil 2’ and ‘Days Gone’ Win Big at the Golden Joystick Awards</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T14:08:10+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 14:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/author/harrison-abbott/" target="_blank">Harrison Abbott</a></address>
      <p>Despite being released all the way back in January, it would seem that Capcom’s outstanding <i><b>Resident Evil 2 </b></i>upgrade has left an enduring impression on gamers. How else would you explain its runaway success at this year’s Golden Joystick awards, where it not only picked up the prize for ‘’Best Audio’’, but also for ‘’Ultimate Game of the Year’’? </p>
      <p>Now in its 37th Year, the Golden Joysticks is one of the longest-running awards show in the industry and serves as a great litmus test of public opinion. After all, the winners are not selected by an exclusive jury or a select panel of critics, but rather by an online ballet that is open to absolutely anyone. To pick up one of the accolades is, therefore, a pretty big deal, with the 2019 ceremony receiving upwards of 3.5 million votes.</p>
      <p>This makes it all the more of an achievement for <i><b>RE: 2</b></i> to claim the top prize, especially when you consider the fact that it was going up against juggernauts like <b><i>The Outer Worlds</i>, <i>Gears 5</i>, <i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</i>, <i>Apex Legends</i>, <i>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</i></b> and, of course, <b><i>Untitled Goose Game</i>. </b>It’s not exactly a shock upset, as the remake received universally stellar reviews and sold very well, but it is still a pleasant surprise, all the same, proving that survival horror is still a big deal.</p>
      <p>In fact, this wasn’t the genre’s only victor of the afternoon, with SIE Bend’s <i><b>Days Gone</b></i> taking home a couple of trophies as well. Namely, the open-world zombie title was recognized for having the ‘’Best Storytelling’’  whilst also edging out <i><b>Concrete Genie</b></i>, <i><b>Dreams</b></i> and the <i><b>MediEvil</b></i> remaster for the ‘’Best PS4 Game’’. Meanwhile, <b><i>Gears 5</i></b> won the ”Best Xbox Game”,  <i><b>Devil May Cry 5</b></i> won ‘’Best Visual Design’’ and <b>Control</b> was bestowed with the ‘’Critics Choice Award’’. </p>
      <p>Unfortunately, neither of <b><i>RE:2</i></b>’s directors (Kazunori Kadoi and Yasuhiro Anpo) were able to make it to the London-based ceremony, but they did show their appreciation via a humble video message. Thanking the fans for their continued support, Anpo admitted that: ‘’The original [<i>Resident Evil 2</i>] is so beloved [and] we felt a lot of pressure during development. So to get this award as a result of our efforts has made us all so happy. ‘’</p>
