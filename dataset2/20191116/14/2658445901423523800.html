      <p>Christian lawyers in Nigeria have kicked against the Federal Government’s move to regulate the social media, saying it is an attempt to muzzle freedom of speech.</p>
      <p>The legal practitioners, under the auspices of Christian Lawyers Fellowship of Nigeria (CLASFON), asked the government to take the issue of security more seriously because Judges, lawyers and security personnel have become targets of kidnappers.</p>
      <p>CLASFON stated these in a communique issued at the end of its President-In-Council Meeting in Abeokuta, capital of Ogun State.</p>
      <p>The communique jointly signed by the National President and National Secretary, Arome Okwori and Tunji Omole respectively said, Nigeria has enough legislation to check the abuse of free speech through legal processes such as libel and defamation suit.</p>
      <p>According to the communique: “CLASFON observes with grave displeasure the attempt by the Federal Government to muzzle freedom of speech by its purported attempt to regulate the activities on the social media given the fact that we have enough legislation to check the abuse of free speech through legal processes such as libel and defamation suit.</p>

      <p>“We, therefore, call on the Federal Government to desist from this draconian approach against the Nigerian people.</p>
      <p>“CLASFON views with dismay the daily rising tide of insecurity in the Country. It is glaring that Judges, lawyers and other law enforcement officers are now endangered species and have become easy prey to kidnappers.</p>
      <p>“CLASFON, therefore, calls on the Federal Government to take seriously the issue of security and ensure the safety and security of all Nigerians particularly the Judges as it is the primary duty of any responsible government.” It said.</p>
      <p>The lawyers also asked the Federal and State governments to declare a State of Emergency on the welfare of the judicial officers, funding for State Judiciaries and working environment for the administration of justice nationwide.</p>
      <p>CLASFON also frowned at what it described as, the way and manner multiple taxes, rates and charges are being imposed on the already impoverished citizens of Nigeria and called on the government to reverse the trend and mitigate the hardship on Nigerians.</p>
