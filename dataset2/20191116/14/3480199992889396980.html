      <p>Sam Ricketts' side finished as runners-up in their group stage and should have faced an away tie but City and Manchester United's academy sides received dispensation from the league to instead play away.</p>
      <p>So the Etihad youngsters will head to Montgomery Waters Meadow for the first knockout round, which will take place the week commencing December 2.</p>
      <p>Town were paired with City's under-21s in last season's group stage where John Askey's side drew 1-1 thanks to a last-gasp Citizens equaliser, Shrewsbury did win the resulting penalty shootout.</p>
      <p>Town boss Ricketts made his intentions clear from the start of this season's competition and has named a strong side in each tie so far. Shrews beat the other 'invited' club they have faced in the competition this season, downing Newcastle United's under-21s 3-0.</p>
