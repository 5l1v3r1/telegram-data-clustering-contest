      <h1>RISE–Ghana supports maiden Upper East GJA Awards</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T15:37:57+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 15:37</time> by <a rel="author">Godfred A. Polkuu, GNA</a></address>

      <p>Bolgatanga, Nov. 16, GNA - The Rural Initiative for Self-Empowerment (RISE-Ghana), a Non-Governmental Organisation, has presented a cheque for Ghc3000.00 to support the Human Rights category of the maiden awards of the Upper East Regional chapter of the Ghana Journalists Association (GJA).</p>
      <p>RISE–Ghana, which is headquartered in Bolgatanga, advocates for human rights-based principles of participation, accountability, non-discrimination and empowerment.</p>
      <p>Mr Awal Ahmed Kariama, the Executive Director of RISE-Ghana, who presented the cheque to the leadership of the Association at the weekend, said the NGO was excited that the Regional GJA was scheduled to organise the awards.</p>
      <p>“Some of us thought that this award scheme should have come long ago considering the great work that journalists from this area are doing, the kinds of innovations that you bring to your work and the difficulty under which you work.”</p>
      <p>He said RISE-Ghana undertook series of programmes in health, education, governance and disability, and that for purposes of the awards, the organisation chose to support the Human Rights category.</p>
      <p>He explained that Human Rights was cross-cutting, adding; “When we address the issues of human rights, then we are addressing issues of poverty, dignity, survival and the right to life.”</p>
      <p>Mr Albert Azongo, a Member of the Regional GJA Awards Planning Committee, expressed gratitude to management and staff of RISE–Ghana for the support.</p>
      <p>He said the GJA and the NGO had had cordial relationships over the years, adding; “It is my belief that this support you have extended to us ahead of our Regional awards would further strengthen our working relationship.”</p>
      <p>Mr Azongo entreated colleague journalists in the Region to produce human rights-based stories to derive the intended purposes, and appealed to philanthropists, NGOs, individuals, and institutions to support the GJA.</p>
      <p>The regional awards were instituted by the National Executive Committee to reward deserving journalists across the regions for works done in 2018, as part of activities to climax the 70th Anniversary celebration of the GJA.</p>
      <p>The Upper East Regional awards programme, which has been postponed from November 9 to December 14, would have journalists awarded in the following categories; Most Promising Journalist, Health, Child Rights Reporting, Human Rights, Gender, and Disability.</p>
      <p>The rest are Business and Financial Reporting, Agriculture, Environment and Sanitation, Investigation, Domestic Tourism, Sports, Best Radio Station, and Best Social Programme on Radio.</p>
