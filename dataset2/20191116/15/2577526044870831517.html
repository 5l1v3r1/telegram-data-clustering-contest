      <h1>Path Of Exile 2 Will Introduce 19 New Ascendancy Classes</h1>

      <p><i><a href="http://www.kotaku.co.uk/2019/11/15/path-of-exile-is-getting-a-sequel">Path of Exile 2</a></i> is set to introduce 19 brand new ascendancy classes to the fray, in addition to the original 19 found in the first game.</p>
      <p>Several of these new ascendancy classes were shown off at ExileCon, and included the Ranger, Tactician and Beastmaster classes alongside teases for the Atmost, Marauder and Reaver.</p>
      <p>The Tactician was one of the more intriguing classes showcased, having access to a whole range of warfare abilities, including Siege Breaker, which supercharges placed ballista totems and Siege Warfare, that bolts enemies down with a snare.</p>
      <p>The other class given the spotlight, the Beastmaster, looked equally impressive, and included a Werecat form skill known as Born To Be Wild. This transformation allows the Beastmaster to supercharge their attacks while in beast form.</p>

      <p>The Atmost class was teased as a weather-manipulating class, while both the Marauder and Reaver ascendancy classes appeared to be heavily melee-based.</p>
      <p>These classes are designed to create a whole new experience in <i>Path of Exile 2</i> for new and returning players, as well as add to the depth and complexity of the game.</p>
      <p><i>Path of Exile 2</i> is currently undated.</p>
