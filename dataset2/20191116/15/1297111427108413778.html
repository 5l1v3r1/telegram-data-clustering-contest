      <h1>Searching for more firepower, Regina Pats pull the trigger on trade for Carter Chorney</h1>
      <h2>The Regina Pats believe that forward Carter Chorney — acquired Wednesday from the Swift Current Broncos — can develop into an offensive weapon.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T15:00:30+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 15:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/gregharderlp" target="_blank">Greg Harder</a></address>
      <p>Carter Chorney’s numbers don’t add up.</p>
      <p>The 18-year-old winger scored just one goal in 17 games this season with the Swift Current Broncos, who <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/hockey/regina-pats/regina-pats-deal-defenceman-to-swift-current-broncos-in-exchange-for-forward">traded him to the Regina Pats on Wednesday for 17-year-old defenceman Sam McGinley</a>.</p>
      <p>Despite Chorney’s lack of production, the Pats view him as a gifted shooter with untapped offensive ability.</p>
      <p>“I think Carter is going to be a good exciting young hockey player for us,” said assistant coach Brad Herauf. “He’s a guy who hasn’t scored as many goals as probably he would like and we expected him to score at the start of this year. But everyone goes through that.</p>
      <p>“The kid can really shoot the puck. If we get him in the right situation and get him playing with the right players, he’s a kid who’s going to score a lot of goals for us in the future.”</p>
      <p>Chorney showed flashes of his raw potential last season, compiling 14 goals and 26 points in 62 games with the Broncos and Spokane Chiefs.</p>
      <p>Spokane traded him to Swift Current on Dec. 4 as part of a five-player deal. The swap didn’t work out for Chorney, who apparently let the Broncos know he’d welcome a change of scenery.</p>
      <p>“Things weren’t really going too well,” he noted. “I talked to them and they said (Regina) wanted me so I’m happy to be here. I’m excited for the opportunity.”</p>
      <p>So are the Pats, who rank 18<sup>th</sup> out of 22 WHL teams with an average of 2.56 goals per game. Captain Austin Pratt — with eight goals in 16 games — is the only skater on the team who’s on pace to hit 30.</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen if Chorney can <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/hockey/regina-pats/pats-expect-forward-progress-despite-lack-of-star-power-up-front">provide a spark for the offensively challenged club</a>, but Herauf liked when he saw while scouting the Chiefs last season. He also thinks Chorney could add another element to Regina’s struggling power play.</p>
      <p>“He has the skill set,” Herauf said. “We could see it playing against him. We watched Spokane quite a bit last year. We’d done a lot of pre-scouts on him and he was always a person that I had really liked.”</p>
      <p>Chorney considers himself “a 200-foot forward” who “can play in every situation.” He was a scorer throughout minor hockey, culminating in 2015-16 when he had 31 goals and 66 points in 36 games with the bantam AAA Sherwood Park Flyers.</p>
      <p>That led to him being selected by Spokane in the second round (39th overall) of the 2016 bantam draft.</p>
      <p>“There is lots more for me to give in this league,” said Chorney, who’s slated to make his Pats debut on Saturday (7 p.m., Brandt Centre) against the Prince Albert Raiders. “I’ve been kind of up and down but I think this is a good fresh start.</p>
      <p>“I’ve talked to the coach (in Regina) and they’re excited to have me. They want me to be more of a shooter. I think of myself as a two-way forward but I can bring that scoring touch.</p>
      <p>“I’ll hopefully get some goals.”</p>
      <p>Chorney’s skating isn’t considered his best trait but he believes it has “improved tremendously” since he was a young player in Spokane.</p>
      <p>While his overall game remains a work in progress, the Pats see a lot of potential.</p>
      <p>“He’s a shooter,” Herauf added. “The biggest thing for him is just being able to get in the offensive zone, work to find the puck and work to create his own shot versus letting his linemates do the work for him. Once he’s involved, he’s going to be a real good player for us.”</p>
