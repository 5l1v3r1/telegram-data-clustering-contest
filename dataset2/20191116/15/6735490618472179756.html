      <p>Colbert also pointed out that Harbour, a.k.a. “king of the dad bod,” could no longer hold that title as he appears noticeably more trim than he was in the most recent season of “Stranger Things”.</p>
      <p>“I have slimmed down a little bit, yeah,” Harbour agreed.</p>
      <p>“Is this hangover from getting jacked for ‘Hellboy’?” asked Colbert.</p>

      <p>“No, the weight gain for season three [of ‘Stranger Things’] was hangover from getting jacked for ‘Hellboy’,” Harbour explained. “I didn’t realize this, but if you work out a lot and then you decide to stop working out and just eat donuts, your body remains very large. But it just transfers from up here [gesturing to his shoulders] to down here [gesturing to his midsection].</p>
