      <p>We’ve got a new episode of <b><i>VFX Artists React to Bad &amp; Great CGI</i></b> from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoRV6UBFSRM">Corridor Crew</a> and in this video the crew is joined by filmmaker and VFX artist Mike Diva. Together they break down and discuss the visual effects in films such as <b><i>TRON: Legacy </i></b>and <b><i>The Matrix Reloaded</i></b>.</p>
      <p><i>TRON: Legacy</i> was in the very early day of seeing older actors de-aged digitally with <b>Jeff Bridges</b>. This may have been the first time for a movie. While the end result of the de-aging process wasn’t the greatest, ten years ago it was still pretty cool to see! They did the best they could. All these years later it’s better, but as we saw with <b>Will Smith </b>in <i>Gemini Man</i>, the tech still has a ways to go.</p>
