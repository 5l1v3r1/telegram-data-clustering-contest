        <b>A manhunt was launched after a man was slashed by a gang in Bamber Bridge.</b>
      </p>
      <p>He was attacked in Cottage Lane at around 1.30pm today, with nearby Charnley Court cordoned off for nearly three hours so forensics experts could search for evidence.</p>
      <p>The man was taken to Royal Preston Hospital for treatment for cuts to an arm, and his back and head, police said. His condition was "not believed to be life-threatening".</p>
      <p>Three vehicles have been seized as part of the investigation, a statement by Lancashire Police said, while no arrests have been made.</p>
      <p>The force added: "Our enquiries are ongoing but we are treating this as an isolated incident and we do not believe there is any wider threat to the general public."</p>
      <p>Witnesses and those with any information that could prove helpful have been asked to call police on 101, quoting log reference number 695 of November 16.</p>
