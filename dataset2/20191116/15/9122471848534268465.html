      <h1>Huskers Insider Has Update On Nebraska’s Wan’Dale Robinson</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T15:15:22+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 15:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>Wan’Dale Robinson, Nebraska’s talented freshman receiver, is one of the most electric players in the country. It wasn’t surprising to see him as a finalist for the Paul Hornung award – given to the nation’s most versatile player.</p>
      <p>However, he hasn’t seen the field in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>Robinson left Nebraska’s last game, the Week 10 loss to Purdue, with a leg injury. Earlier this week, offensive coordinator <a href="https://thespun.com/big-ten/nebraska-cornhuskers/nebraska-issues-update-on-freshman-wandale-robinson">Troy Walters called him “very questionable”</a> for this weekend’s game against Wisconsin.</p>
      <p>The star wide receiver doesn’t appear to be on track to play this afternoon. According to a report from Nebraska insider Andy Kendeigh, Robinson was not on the team buses before today’s game.</p>

      <p>At 4-5, Nebraska needs to find two wins from this weekend’s home game against No. 14 Wisconsin, a trip to Maryland, and the season finale at home against No. 20 Iowa to become bowl eligible.</p>
      <p>Losing Robinson is a major blow to the Huskers chances at an upset.</p>
      <p>The freshman leads the team with 40 receptions, and is second on the roster with 453 receiving yards.  Robinson is also the team’s third-leading rusher, with 85 carries for 326 yards and three touchdowns.</p>
      <p>Wisconsin enters as a 14-point favorite, despite playing in Lincoln. The Badgers and Huskers kick off at 12:00 p.m. ET on Big Ten Network.</p>
