      <p>Infection control and prevention in five acute hospitals is being affected by overcrowding.</p>
      <p>A new report from Hiqa shows the issue is also being impacted by old and unsuitable infrastructure.</p>
      <p>Five hospital inspections were carried out between April and June.</p>
      <p>Of the five, maintenance and infrastructural deficits in three hospitals had not been addressed since the last inspection.</p>
      <p>Those hospitals were Croom in Limerick, Nenagh Hospital and Sligo University Hospital.</p>
      <p>It says Croom and Nenagh also had no one designated as the lead or coordinator for decontamination.</p>
      <p>However Hiqa does say all five hospitals have leadership, governance and management arrangements for infection prevention and controls were in place.</p>
