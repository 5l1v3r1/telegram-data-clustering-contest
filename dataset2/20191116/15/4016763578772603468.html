      <h1>Knowledge Drop: How Suge Knight Forced Dr. Dre To Change His Album Title To ‘2001’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T15:30:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 15:30</time> by <a rel="author">Grant Rindner</a></address>
      <p>Today marks the 20th anniversary of <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Dr-dre">Dr. Dre</a>’s <a href="https://genius.com/albums/Dr-dre/2001"><i>2001</i></a>, which redefined the West Coast icon’s legacy and career. But according to <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/1428265/dr-dre-changes-album-title-again/">an MTV article from 1999</a>, it was originally supposed to be released under the name <i>Chronic 2000</i>, a reference to his seminal 1992 debut <a href="https://genius.com/albums/Dr-dre/The-chronic"><i>The Chronic</i></a> and the then-impending new millennium. The change was forced upon Dre by <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Suge-knight">Suge Knight</a>, his former friend turned foe and <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Death-row-records">Death Row Records</a> co-founder, who released a compilation titled <a href="https://genius.com/albums/Various-artists/Suge-knight-represents-chronic-2000"><i>Suge Knight Represents: Chronic 2000</i></a>.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://twitter.com/fakeshoredrive/status/1124684730610475009">Andrew Barber on Twitter</a>, Suge’s <i>Chronic 2000</i> was advertised as featuring unreleased music from Snoop and even Dre himself, but neither artist appeared on the project.</p>
      <p>In May 1999, <i>Chronic 2000</i> was released to critical derision but a solid commercial performance, peaking at No. 11 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200. The record featured music from former Dre collaborators like <a href="https://genius.com/artists/2pac">2Pac</a>, <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Daz-dillinger">Daz Dillinger</a>, and <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Outlawz">Outlawz</a>. It also included diss songs against Dre collaborators <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Eminem">Eminem</a> (<a href="https://genius.com/Miilkbone-presenting-miilkbone-lyrics">“Presenting Miilkbone”</a>) and <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Snoop-dogg">Snoop Dogg</a> (<a href="https://genius.com/Swoop-g-dont-forget-where-you-came-from-lyrics">“Don’t Forget Where You Came From”</a>).</p>
      <p>The latter even features a jab at Dre that alludes to Suge taking his album title, where <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Swoop-g">Swoop G</a> raps:</p>
      <blockquote>Dr. Dre thanks a lot for that <i>Chronic</i> you dropped<br/>Now I’m droppin mine in ‘99<br/>The present is mine<br/>In the year two-thous, please believe we holdin it down</blockquote>
      <p>The rift between Dre and Suge was cemented in 1996, <a href="https://www.theringer.com/music/2019/11/15/20965194/dr-dre-2001-chronic-20th-anniversary-eminem-aftermath-death-row-snoop-dogg">when Dre left Death Row to found Aftermath</a>. Dre even released a maligned compilation of his own <a href="https://genius.com/albums/Dr-dre/The-aftermath"><i>Dr. Dre Presents… The Aftermath</i></a>, which featured artists like <a href="https://genius.com/artists/King-t">King T</a>, <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Scarface">Scarface</a>, and <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Rbx">RBX</a>.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, <i>2001</i> was still a massive success, going six times platinum and winning Dre and Eminem a Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group Grammy for <a href="https://genius.com/Dr-dre-forgot-about-dre-lyrics">“Forgot About Dre.”</a> With the help of producer <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Mel-man">Mel-Man</a>, Dre reinvented his sound, moving away from G-funk to something more gothic and string-heavy.</p>
