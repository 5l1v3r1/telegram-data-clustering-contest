        <b>The leader of the Scottish Conservatives has said "the rocks will melt with the sun" before his party supports Nicola Sturgeon's plan for a second independence referendum.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Speaking in Newton Mearns while campaigning in the East Renfrewshire constituency on Saturday, Jackson Carlaw claimed the SNP was attempting to "chuck away" the verdict of the 2014 independence referendum.</p>
      <p>He also took aim at Jeremy Corbyn following the Labour leader's visit to Scotland last week <a href="https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/jeremy-corbyn-rows-back-on-refusal-to-grant-indyref2-in-first-term-1-5045342">which saw him shift his position</a> on whether he would grant an IndyRef2 if he took power following next month's election.</p>

      <p>"But what we’ve learnt this week is that it goes much deeper than that. On one level, his visit to Scotland this week was just a shambles – and I’m pretty sure we all laughed at the sheer amateurism of it all. But this really is no laughing matter.</p>
      <p>"Because to see the leader of one of a once great political parties casually dismissing the need to stop the break-up of our country is chilling.</p>
      <p>"Time after time, Mr Corbyn had the chance to say no to Nicola Sturgeon. He had ample opportunities to say something positive about our United Kingdom – to talk up his belief in our Union. Yet he point-blank refused."</p>
      <p>He continued: "So, unlike Jeremy Corbyn let me make clear: the Scottish Conservatives will not, under any circumstances, support another referendum on independence. Not because we resist democracy – but because we demand democracy be respected.</p>
      <p>"We reject the First Minister’s concept of disposable democracy: the idea that you can chuck away a once in a generation decision because you’ve had enough of it.</p>
      <p>In short – and to borrow a phrase – the rocks will melt with the sun before we ever give in to Nicola Sturgeon demand for a second independence referendum."</p>
