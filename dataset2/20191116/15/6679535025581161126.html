      <p>Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari on Saturday announced financial relief to farmers whose crops were damaged in unseasonal rains, and ordered its immediate disbursal.</p>
      <p>The relief entails ₹8,000 per hectare up to two hectares for agricultural Kharif crops and ₹18,000 per hectare up to two hectares for horticulture/perennial crops, an official statement said.</p>
      <p>The Governor also exempted wards of the affected agriculturists from paying educational fees, it said.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/presidents-rule-imposed-in-maharashtra/article29954298.ece">Maharashtra has been under President’s Rule since November 12</a>, as no political party could form a government in the wake of a fractured mandate in the Assembly polls that failed to elect a clear winner.</p>
      <p>The Governor reviewed crop losses caused by untimely rains in various parts of the State during the months of October and November, the statement said.</p>
      <p>“The Governor has also announced exemptions of land revenue to the affected area and examination fee of school and colleges to the wards of affected farmers,” it said.</p>
      <p>The Governor also directed the State administration to disburse the relief immediately, it added.</p>
      <p>The then Chief Minister, Devendra Fadnavis, had on November 2 approved ₹10,000 crore as a special assistance for affected farmers.</p>
      <p>The NCP and the Congress had termed the assistance “meagre” and demanded it be raised to at least ₹25,000 crore.</p>
      <p>Unseasonal rains and delayed retreat of monsoon had damaged Kharif crops of farmers in many districts, with Marathwada and north Maharashtra regions bearing the brunt.</p>
      <h3>‘Assistance inadequate’</h3>
      <p>Meanwhile, Congress leader Ashok Chavan on Saturday said the assistance announced by the Governor was “inadequate”.</p>
      <p>“However, the administration should deposit this assistance in the accounts of farmers immediately. Additional relief will be declared when a government, of which Congress will be a part, is formed,” Mr. Chavan said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Another former Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan claimed that 92 lakh farmers were affected, as the withdrawing monsoon damaged crops on 88-lakh hectares.</p>
      <p>“The help is inadequate. An aid of ₹25,000 per hectare should be given as demanded earlier by Opposition parties. We expect the Governor will try to get as much help as possible,” Mr. Chavan said.</p>

      <p>NCP leader Dhananjay Munde said the affected farmers need a substantial financial aid that is commensurate with the extent of the damage caused to their crops.</p>
      <p>Shiv Sena MP Rahul Shewale also demanded more assistance to the farmers.</p>
      <p>The Sena leader said he had demanded that the Central government offer a substantial assistance to the affected farmers.</p>
      <p>At present, the Congress and the NCP are working out the possibility of forming a coalition government in alliance with the Shiv Sena, hitherto their arch rival in politics.</p>
      <p>Measures like a complete loan waiver for farmers were reportedly discussed ahead of finalising the draft Common Minimum Programme (CMP) for the three parties.</p>
