        <b>Gardaí are appealing for witnesses after an ATM theft in Co Louth.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It happened on Main Street in Dunleer at around 3.30am on Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>The ATM had been damaged in the Bank of Ireland branch - a digger and lorry were discovered at the scene.</p>
      <p>Gardaí say "a significant amount" of damage was caused to the premises.</p>
      <p>They are appealing to any person in Dunleer between 3.00am and 4.00am on Saturday and who saw anything unusual, or to any road users with camera footage, to make contact.</p>
      <p>Gardaí are also appealing to anyone who saw any suspicious vehicles in the Dundalk area at this time.</p>
      <p>They believe those responsible left the scene in a silver Toyota Land Cruiser, with a partial registration '04-MH', heading north of Dunleer.</p>
      <p>They are appealing for any person who saw this vehicle - or knows the whereabouts of the vehicle - to contact Drogheda Garda station on 041-987-4200, the Gardaí Confidential Line at 1800-666-111 or any Garda station.</p>
