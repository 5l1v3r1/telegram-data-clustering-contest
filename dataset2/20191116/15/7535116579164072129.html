      <p>Apart from that, 20% reported that they are bullied at work which contributes to the work stress and since they are spending long hours hunched over their laptops, 84% have reported that they were suffering from one or more musculoskeletal conditions. The survey wrote, as quoted by the <a href="https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2019/11/539026/survey-malaysian-employees-are-overworked-sleep-deprived-unhealthy">New Straits Times</a>,</p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>‚ÄúIn addition to long working hours, increased after-hours work connectivity and work-related stress are also factors associated with sleep problems, which could lead to the increasing probability of developing severe mental health condition among employees.‚Äù</b>

      <p>On top of these worrisome percentages, there are also other statistics that are equally bad. 42% of employees have reported that they are overweight and obese and for those who are suffering all these problems, 45% of the companies they work for do no provide any form of mental help.</p>
