      <h2>Carer Tracy Smith, from St Helens, underwent eight-hour surgery to rebuild her back with "bolts and screws" after having one of her first epileptic fit looking as she looked after a patient</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T15:01:29+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 15:01</time> by <a rel="author">Olivia Williams, Chris Flanagan</a></address>
      <p>A social care worker broke her back in four places and bit through her tongue while having a seizure as she was working in the community.</p>
      <p>Tracy Smith had her first ever epileptic fit two weeks ago while giving a patient a body wash - following which she woke up in "horrendous" pain and surrounded by paramedics.</p>
      <p>The 42-year-old, from St Helens, was rushed to hospital where she said doctors started running to see the X-ray due to the severity of her injuries.</p>
      <p>"I woke up that Wednesday fine, I went to work, had an epileptic seizure, broke my back in four places and was diagnosed with osteoporosis all in one day," she told the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/healthy-mum-shattered-spine-four-17253403">Echo</a> .</p>
      <p>"I just want to get my life I used to have back, it has changed so much I want to be back at work and my life back to how it was."</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Test results revealed she had broken her spine in four places - including a burst fracture - meaning parts of the spine shattered into surrounding tissue and possibly the spinal canal.</p>
      <p>Tracy was then transferred to the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/the-walton-centre-1">Walton Centre</a> where she had an eight-hour operation to rebuild the bottom of her back with "bolts and screws", before which she was warned she may never walk again.</p>
      <p>However, the operation was successful and Tracy now has a long recovery ahead - made more difficult after being diagnosed with osteoporosis - a condition that weakens the bones and makes them more likely to break.</p>
      <p>The  <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/st-helens">St Helens mum</a>  said she currently relies on using a wheelchair or a shopping trolley to get around the house and her 18-year-old daughter has to do all of her personal care.</p>

      <p>She added: "I'm still in shock, I cry sometimes. I used to have such a normal life and now I am in a wheelchair or I have to use one of those trolleys that elderly people use to get around the house.</p>
      <p>"My daughter has been amazing, she's only 18 and she was there from 8am to 11pm when I was in hospital.</p>
      <p>"She now does all of my personal care including washing and showering and I have my mum looking after me.</p>
      <p>"I just want the life I used to have. If I have to use a walking stick in the future I would like a pink one.</p>
      <p>"I am dead girlie, I always get my nails done and I work hard for that - I just want to be to be who I was before."</p>
      <p>Tracy said <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/nhs">doctors</a> are now waiting to see how her body recovers and will see a specialist in a few weeks time.</p>
      <p>The mum was provided some aids from the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/nhs">NHS</a> to help with her recovery at home and is on a waiting list for physiotherapy.</p>
      <p>However, her friends and family have set up a <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/tracys-troopers?utm_source=Facebook&amp;utm_medium=Yimbyprojectpage&amp;utm_content=tracys-troopers&amp;utm_campaign=projectpage-share-owner&amp;utm_term=Y5XMVbdQK&amp;fbclid=IwAR3Pxhp3E1Hbhp-bEtudvgmMBQPefcduLz9dp5e5m3zcfuuZmK_UWX18Ud8">JustGiving</a> page to get extra equipment to aid a quicker recovery and help the mum "get back on her feet" and the "chance to get her future back".</p>
