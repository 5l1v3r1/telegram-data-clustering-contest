      <h3>Missing Persons Helpline factfile 2</h3>
      <h3>How many people go missing each year?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Missing <u>people</u>: of the 180,000 people reported missing over <b>95,000 are adults</b> and over <b>80,000 are children</b></li>
        <li>Missing <u>incidents</u>: of the 340,000 reported incidents over <b>125,000 incidents are adults</b> and over <b>210,000 incidents are children</b></li>
        <li>Looked after children are at high risk of being reported missing. <b>1 in 10</b> looked after children are reported missing each year compared to <b>1 in 200</b> total children. Looked after children who are reported missing will be reported on average <b>6 times</b></li>
      </ul>
      <p>The number of missing incidents is higher than the number of individuals who go missing because some people go missing more than once. Most of the people who are reported missing are vulnerable or at risk and many are reported missing multiple times, making them even more vulnerable.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Devon and Cornwall Police have said they believe Mr Cooper may have driven towards Seaton and are urging residents to call police if they spot him. <br/><br/>Anyone with information or knowledge as to Gary's whereabouts is asked to contact Dorset Police at www.dorset.police.uk, via email 101@dorset.pnn.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting incident number 16:91.</p>
