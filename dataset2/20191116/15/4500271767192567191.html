      <p>United States Air Force Chief of Staff David Goldfein on Saturday pressed Gulf Arab states to reconcile differences and unify military capabilities as tensions with Iran simmer.</p>
      <p>Washington sees an ongoing dispute that Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and non-Gulf state Egypt have with Qatar as a threat to efforts to contain Iran and has pushed for a united front.</p>
      <p>“When a missile or a UAV (drone) is en route from Iran that is not the time to reconcile past grievances. That time is now. Today,” Goldfein told an air chiefs conference in Dubai.</p>
      <p>The US blames Iran for a series of attacks in the Gulf over the summer, including the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1505344/attacks-on-saudi-oil-facilities-knock-out-half-the-kingdoms-supply">September 14 missile and drone attack</a> on Saudi Arabia that temporarily shutdown half the kingdom’s oil production. Tehran denies involvement.</p>
      <p>Washington has unsuccessfully tried to mediate the dispute, in which the four nations have severed political, trade and transport <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1486296">ties with Qatar</a> since mid-2017 over accusations it supports terrorism.</p>
      <p>Doha denies the charge and says the embargo aims to impinge on its sovereignty.</p>
      <p>The United States is allied to all six Gulf states. Qatar hosts Al-Udeid air base, the largest US military facility in the region, while Bahrain is home to the Navy’s Fifth Fleet.</p>
      <p>“No one country has everything it needs to defend itself but together we have exactly what we need for collective defense,” Goldfein said.</p>
      <p>“We have the power to begin this right now as we face a common adversary who seems committed to malign behavior across the region.”</p>
      <p>Emphasising the principle of collective security, Goldfein said the best chance to defend the UAE could be from Qatar or neighboring Oman.</p>
      <p>“Neighbors to the right and to the left who by geometry-alone have a better shot,” he said.</p>
