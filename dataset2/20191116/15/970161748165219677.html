      <p>A former <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jeremy-kyle/">Jeremy Kyle</a> guest has shown off her incredible transformation after beating a 20-year drug addiction.</p>
      <p>Michelle Wallace appeared on the now-axed chat show seeking help from the host to try and help her combat her addiction to heroin.</p>
      <p>Sharing a picture to Tik Tok, the former prostitute is celebrating almost a year of being sober – and she look looks so much healthier and happier for it.</p>
      <p>The caption read: ‘Today a year ago I’m [sic] came to Luton off the jk show to rehab I’m gonna be a year clean on the 1/12/19.’</p>
      <p>Michelle returned to the ITV programme in April this year and spent 10 weeks in rehab – which cost her £120 a day.</p>
      <p>She finished her treatment back in May and at the time the show posted on Twitter: ‘We are happy to announce that [Michelle] has now finished her treatment and has left rehab – A brilliant achievement, well done!’</p>

      <p>The Jeremy Kyle show was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/05/13/jeremy-kyle-show-axed-today-suspended-indefinitely-guest-died-filming-9508614/">pulled off the air</a> in May after Steve Dymond, 62, died by suicide after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/05/15/jeremy-kyle-guest-cried-throughout-filming-collapsed-ground-cancelled-episode-9541593/">he failed a lie detector test</a> on the show.</p>

      <p>Since it was axed, several former contestants have come forward making some bold claims against the show and Jeremy Kyle himself.</p>
      <p>Most recently, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/former-jeremy-kyle-guest-to-take-host-to-court-after-he-almost-destroyed-marriage-with-fake-transgender-affair-11125569/">Stephen Beer from Plymouth has alleged that TV bosses staged a ‘fake affair’.</a></p>
      <p>Mr Beer made his first appearance after he accused his wife of cheating on him but since he has told how it ‘felt like a prison’ backstage.</p>
      <p>He continued: ‘They checked your bags and took your phones off you. You could be kept in one room for hours.</p>
      <p>‘The producers kept coming into say things to wind you up and told us that Jeremy had called me a “prat” and to have a go at him.’</p>

      <p>Mr Beer has also made some bold claims after accusing bosses of ‘staging an affair’. He appeared on the show again in 2016 along with Melissa Ede, in an episode titled ‘my transgender love rival is trying to steal my husband’.</p>
      <p>The episode saw transgender taxi driver Melissa go head to head with Stephen over allegations he was cheating on his wife with her.</p>
      <p>However new information has emerged since, as Stephen confessed the whole affair was set-up.</p>
      <p>He continued: ‘The producers staged the affair with myself and Melissa, who tragically passed away earlier this year.  She wanted to go on the show anyway but the story about the affair is fake.</p>

      <p>‘They also told us to send each other text messages so it would look like there was more going on, but none of it was true.</p>
