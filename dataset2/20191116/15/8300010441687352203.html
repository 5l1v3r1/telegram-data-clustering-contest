      <p>ATLANTA -- Nearly three years after playing his last NFL game, Colin Kaepernick is looking to make a comeback.<br/><br/>Representatives from more than two dozen teams <a href="https://abc7.com/sports/nfl-invites-kaepernick-to-attend-private-workout/5693540/">are expected to attend a workout organized by the NFL</a> at the Falcon's training facility in Atlanta, scheduled to begin at 3 p.m. EST on Saturday.<br/><br/>The practice, led by former NFL coach Hugh Jackson, is serving as a job audition of sorts to a man who's led a team to the Super Bowl. Jackson will be testing his arm strength, conditioning, and mental discipline.<br/><br/>"It'll be mostly area scouts, but it will be more than 24 NFL teams, and I think that's a turnout that has to please everybody involved," said ESPN's Adam Schefter.<br/><br/>The NFL gave Kaepernick five days notice of the practice with no room to negotiate, but that doesn't seem to deter the 32-year-old.<br/><br/>"I've been in shape and ready for this for 3 years," he tweeted.</p>

      <p>The NFL has been criticized for this scheduled practice, as scouts usually attend college football games and coaches are traveling for their weekly games on Saturdays.<br/><br/>"The whole thing seems to me to be a manufactured stunt ... We don't know whether they're going to send head coach, water boy, cheerleader - we'll wait and see," said Mark Geragos, Kaepernick's lawyer.<br/><br/>The once- star quarterback played six seasons for the San Francisco 49ers before his career was derailed. Around the time of President Donald Trump's 2016 election win, Kaepernick started taking a knee during the National Anthem to protest social and racial injustice shortly after.<br/><br/>He drew strong criticism from Trump and many others for his peaceful demonstration.<br/><br/>When he became a free agent the next season, no team would sign him, and he eventually sued the league for colluding to keep him out.<br/><br/>The NFL in February settled the collusion grievance Kaepernick and former teammate Eric Reid had filed. Reid now plays for the Carolina Panthers.<br/><br/>"If he has any hope and any chance of returning to the NFL -- that time is growing really short," Schefter said.<br/><br/><i>The Associated Press contributed to this story.</i></p>
