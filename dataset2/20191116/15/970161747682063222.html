      <p>The BBC have announced plans to scrap the after school slot for Newsround after 40 years as kids get most of their news online these days.</p>
      <p>The news bulletin aimed at children was previously shown in the morning as well as at teatime, but the BBC has submitted a proposal to Ofcom to reduce the amount of news on CBBC from 85 to 35 hours a year.</p>
      <p>The corporation is looking to invest the money it would save into online news for children rather than the TV programme.</p>
      <p>The show was launched in 1972 as John Craven’s Newsround after presenter John Craven who hosted it for the first 17 years.</p>
      <p>It’s been a staple in the after-school viewing schedules of kids for generations, so it’s no wonder Twitter was awash with commiseration that it would no longer be shown in the afternoon.</p>

      <p>They tweeted: ‘Surely not… Generations of kids were informed of the news in a way we could understand… John Craven gave me my interest in news and it’s never gone away.’</p>

      <p>Another added: ‘#Newsround being cut? Where the **** am I going to go when I need an explanation I can actually understand of the Irish Backstop and Israel v Palestine?’</p>
      <p>Many praised the way the show made news easily understandable: ‘Now this is truly sad news. Newsround was groundbreaking in so many ways. Never talked down to its audience. Broke many stories first, and in an accessible way.’</p>
      <p>Newsround broke several world news stories, including the loss of the Space Shuttle Challenger in 1986 and was also first bulletin in Britain to report an assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II in Vatican City in 1981 and the Windsor Castle fire in 1992.</p>
      <p>The BBC are yet to announce when the afternoon bulletin will be scrapped, but viewers will still be able to watch it in the morning as well as on their website.</p>
