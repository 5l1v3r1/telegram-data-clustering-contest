      <p>A road closure in the centre of a <a href="https://www.devonlive.com/news/devon-news/">Devon </a>town is likely to cause traffic and delays for a whole week.</p>
      <p>Devon County Council has revealed the B3149 Rolle Street in <a href="https://www.devonlive.com/all-about/barnstaple">Barnstaple</a> will shut every day from Monday, November 18 to Friday, November 22.</p>
      <p>The road, which is a main thoroughfare to Barnstaple from the Braunton direction, is being closed by to allow South West Water to renew a ataer pipe in the area.</p>
      <p>The council says during the closure that "delays are likely".</p>
      <p>A diversion will be in place taking motorists along Fair View and Pilton Causeway.</p>

      <p>However, as many motorists have pointed out on social media, Pilton Causeway is already part of another diversion route due to the closure of nearby Derby Road - which is also undergoing work from South West Water until January 31, 2020.</p>
      <p>North Devon Council took to Facebook to share the news - and many people were not happy.</p>
      <p>One person said: "What an earth are Devon County Council thinking of to allow SWW to do this??!! Pilton Causeway is already on a diversion route because Derby Road is closed.</p>
      <p>"Barnstaple fire station and the NDDH is at the end of the diversion route - how the heck is that going to work in a major emergency (or even a minor one) at a peak time?"</p>
      <p>Another person added: "Fair view already like a car park at busy times. That'll be me walking too and from work then as the other road closure has caused this. That's ridiculous."</p>
      <p>One commenter said: "Fantastic, more traffic past my house, what with Derby road closed for four months now this road!</p>
