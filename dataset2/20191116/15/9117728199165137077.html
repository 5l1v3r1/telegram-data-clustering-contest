        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lewis-hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> pipped <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/max-verstappen">Max Verstappen</a> and <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/charles-leclerc">Charles Leclerc</a> as the World Champion topped the timesheets in FP3. A quiet session saw Hamilton set the fastest lap ahead of his rivals.</b>

      <p>It looked for much of the session that <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/scuderia-ferrari">Ferrari</a> would replicate their form from FP2 on Friday but with just under 20 minutes remaining, Hamilton pulled out his quickest lap to top FP3. Hamilton's time of 1:08.320 was enough to top the timesheets with the pressure off now the title is wrapped up.</p>
      <p>Max Verstappen pulled out a 1:08.346 to pip Charles Leclerc to P2 as the Monegasque beat his teammate, <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/sebastian-vettel">Sebastian Vettel</a> to complete the top three. Ferrari looked strong in FP2 but they weren't able to repeat that performance as Hamilton and Verstappen showed their class.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/alexander-albon">Alex Albon</a> came through in fourth but it was a disappointing session for <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/valtteri-bottas">Valtteri Bottas</a> who finished sixth eight tenths down on his teammate. </p>
      <p>In a quiet session, the midfield was fragmented with three teams rounding out the top ten, <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mclaren">McLaren</a> the only team with both drivers in there. There was a moment of tension between <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/sergio-perez">Sergio Perez</a> and <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/romain-grosjean">Romain Grosjean</a> as the prior backed up the Frenchman, much to his frustration.</p>
      <p>However, that was as good as it got in terms of drama as the session went off without a hitch.</p>
