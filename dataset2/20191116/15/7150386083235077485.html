      </p>
      <p>Gujarat has been having a great run in the Syed Mushtaq Ali trophy with three back to back wins. Gujarat would look to continue the winning momentum when they take on Jharkhand in a Group E clash on Sunday. For Gujarat, the only concern is that their premier batsman Parthiv Patel has not been among the runs and the southpaw would like to change that against Jharkhand.</p>
      <p>Jharkhand, after their loss against Delhi, would like to get back to winning ways which will make it a mouthwatering clash.</p>
