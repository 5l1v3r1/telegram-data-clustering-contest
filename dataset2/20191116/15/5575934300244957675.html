      <p>Elon Musk and YouTube personality Casey Neistat shared a moment online as both appreciated a very long telescopic pole employed by a Tesla engineer to assess Neistat’s house for solar panels.</p>
      <p>Neistat shared a photo of the Tesla staffer at his house, with what he described as “the most boss selfie stick I’ve ever seen.”</p>

      <p>He appeared to be using the stick to work out the practicalities of getting Tesla solar panels onto Neistat’s home. Tesla Energy makes both panels and batteries to store the energy.</p>
      <p>On noticing Neistat’s appreciative post, Musk shared it with his own followers, noting: “Innovation comes in many ways.”</p>

      <p>Neistat retweeted that to his followers, and the cycle was complete.</p>
      <p>The YouTuber has a history of appreciating Musk and his products, though the two appear never to have met.</p>
      <p>In October 2018, Neistat responded to a tweet by Musk thanking Tesla owners, saying that his Tesla is the “greatest car I’ve owned.”</p>

      <p>He has also devoted several videos to Musk. One was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM16ZeR7oEU">a riff on Musk’s comments linking social media to unhappiness</a> in his infamous weed-smoking interview with Joe Rogan.</p>
      <p>Another was a tour of a prototype tunnel by Musk’s Boring Company in Los Angeles, where Neistat was one of a select group invited on a test drive, though he was not allowed to film it.</p>

      <p>This is likely not the end of their online bromance.</p>
