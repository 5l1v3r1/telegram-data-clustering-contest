      <p>Public donations of more than $160,000 have poured in for the devastated families of two teenagers murdered in the Saugus High School shooting massacre.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/dominic-blackwell-identified-as-saugus-high-school-shooting-victim/"><i>New York Post</i></a> reports the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner confirmed Blackwell and 15-year-old Gracie Anne Muehlberger were the two victims slain at the Santa Clarita high school by alleged shooter Nathaniel Berhow.</p>
      <p>As of early Saturday local time, two GoFundMe pages set up for the families of the two victims had raised $A160,000 - against a target of $A3000.</p>
      <p>“On November 14, 2019, this world lost a bright, shining light … personified by a goofy laugh, cheesy smile, and a huge, caring heart,” his GoFundMe page said.</p>
      <p>“He was taken from his family and friends in the most senseless of ways,” the page said. “His three brothers will miss their big brother greatly, and his parents’ dreams for him will never be realised.</p>
      <p>“Dominic’s family needs this time to pull together and mourn this unexpected loss.”</p>

      <p>Dominic was also remembered by a friend as a football player who played on a local youth team, <i>ABC Los Angeles</i> reported.</p>
      <p>A GoFundMe page has also been set up for Gracie Anne.</p>
      <p>“It is with the most unexplainable brokenness that we share our Gracie went to be with Jesus on Thursday morning,” the page reads.</p>
      <p>The two pages each had a target to raise $US1000 ($A1500). As of Saturday morning local time, more than $US63,000 ($A95,000) had been raised for Gracie’s family, and $US45,000 ($A66,000)</p>
      <p>Surveillance footage captured the suspect, who also attended the school, walking onto the campus’ quad, pulling a .45-calibre semi-automatic pistol from his backpack and shooting five fellow students before turning the gun on himself, police officials said.</p>

      <h3>ALLEGED SHOOTER ‘FUNNY AND LIKABLE’</h3>
      <p>The teenage boy who planned the attack that killed two students and wounded three others at his Southern California high school has been described as “quiet, but funny and likeable” by friends.</p>
      <p>Nathaniel Tennosuke Berhow, 16, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound sustained after he shot the others.</p>
      <p>His mother was present when he died, according to a Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department statement.</p>
      <p>Investigators have yet to uncover details and the motivation for him to bring a handgun to campus and open fire shortly after his mother dropped him off, authorities said.</p>
      <p>Berhow showed no outward signs of violence prior to the attack.</p>
      <p>After more than 40 interviews, police still don’t know what prompted him to commit such a crime, said Captain Kent Wegener of the department’s homicide unit.</p>
      <p>He said no manifesto, diary or suicide note had been found.</p>
      <p>“It still remains a mystery why,” Sheriff Alex Villanueva said. He said it was “a planned attack, it was deliberate,” but “we don’t have” the details behind it.</p>
      <p>Berhow opened fire around 7.30am local time Thursday on his birthday, after being dropped off at Saugus High School in the Los Angeles suburb of Santa Clarita.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Video surveillance showed Berhow walk alone to the center of a quad, drop his backpack, pull out the gun and start firing, police said.</p>
      <p>Sheriff Villanueva said after opening fire Berhow “cleared a malfunction” with the gun and kept shooting. He counted his rounds, firing about six shots and using the last bullet on himself. The attack took just 16 seconds.</p>
      <p>“As far as we know the actual targets were at random,” the sheriff said, adding that Berhow brought the weapon to school, handled it ably and kept track of the rounds fired. “It wasn’t a spur-of-the-moment act,” Sheriff Villanueva said.</p>

      <p>Three off-duty law enforcement officers were first on the scene and treated some of the wounded until paramedics arrived.</p>
      <p>The dead were identified as 15-year-old Gracie Anne Muehlberger and 14-year-old Dominic Blackwell.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Bryan and Cindy Muehlberger said they shared the news of their daughter’s death with “unexplainable brokenness.” They described her as their “Cinderella, the daughter we always dreamed to have,” and said her two brothers were heartbroken.</p>

      <p>“She will never get to drive a car, fall in love, build a career, get married, have children and do all the other things everyonetakes for granted in this short thing called life,” they said.</p>
      <p>“We miss her smile, laughter, sweet kisses, and her amazing sense of humor. We will even miss her constant pestering for Starbucksand Cold Stone and anything else with lots of sugar in it. It must have been the reason why she was so sweet.” Two girls woundedin the attack, ages 14 and 15, were shot in the torso and should be released from the hospital over the weekend, doctors saidFriday. A 14-year-old boy was treated and released.</p>
      <p>The names of the wounded were not released.</p>
      <p>Berhow was described as a quiet and smart kid who was a Boy Scout and had previously run track for his school.</p>

      <p>“You have the image of a loner, someone who is socially awkward, doesn’t get along, some violent tendencies, dark broodingand online strange postings - stuff like that,” Villanueva said. With this boy, investigators have found “nothing out of theordinary. He’s a cookie-cutter kid that you could find anywhere.” In fact, the stereotype of the loser sociopath is ofteninaccurate, according to the psychologist who wrote federal guidelines for assessing school shooting threats and has interviewed 10 shooters. What pushes most shooters is some kind of loss or disappointment, often recent, followed by the inability tocope with a feeling of being overwhelmed, according to Marisa Randazzo, a former chief research psychologist at the U.S. SecretService.</p>
      <p>“These are acts of suicide as much as homicide,” said Randazzo, who is now CEO of a firm that does threat assessments.</p>

      <p>Most shooters she studied were academically successful and weren’t social outcasts.</p>
      <p>Friends said while the boy could be introverted, he had a girlfriend and good social network focused on his cross-countryteammates.</p>
      <p>Randazzo said she expects investigators eventually will learn that someone had an inkling of trouble.</p>
      <p>Berhow’s father was an avid hunter who died two years ago. Police said they found several firearms at Berhow’s home and somewere unregistered. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is working with police to determine where Berhowgot the handgun used in the attack.</p>

        <b>HOW TEEN SURVIVED THE SHOOTING</b>
      </p>
      <p>One of the five students shot during the Saugus High School shooting in California has been identified as her aunt revealed how she managed to survive.</p>
      <p>The teenager, named only as Addison, had surgery and is expected to make a full recovery.</p>
      <p><i>Good Morning America</i> reported that Addison stumbled into a room where choir teacher Katie Holt sheltered 40 children behind a piano as gunfire broke out.</p>
      <p>“Addison rushed in. We cleared a space for her, I wrapped the wound,” Ms Holt said. “She had a gunshot wound. I should have never had to treat a gunshot wound as a choir teacher. I held a bleeding child today in a room of 40 children.”</p>
      <p>“I don’t think there’s any sort of training that can prepare you for this,” she said.</p>

      <p>Nathan Berhow, 16, is the reported suspect who shot five classmates after he pulled a gun from his backpack and began his 16-second attack at Saugus High School in the city of Santa Clarita.</p>
      <p>He then turned the .45 calibre semi automatic pistol on himself and is now in hospital in a grave condition.</p>
      <p>A 14-year-old boy died at a hospital. Earlier, a 16-year-old girl died at the school.</p>
      <p>The three surviving victims remain hospitalised.</p>
      <p>His .45-caliber handgun was found with no bullets remaining when it was recovered.</p>
      <p>LA County Sheriff’s Captain Kent Wegener revealed Berhow left a message on an Instagram account, which read: “Saugus have fun at school tomorrow.”</p>
      <p>The message was posted Thursday morning (US time) but it’s unclear when. They say it was later removed, and they don’t know who made the change.</p>
      <p>Wegener said it “may have some significance” as they have obtained a search warrant to raid his home for more evidence.</p>
      <p>NBC reports Berhow’s girlfriend and mother were being questioned by authorities.</p>
      <p>The FBI says there’s no reason to believe he was acting on behalf of a group or ideology or that there were any conspirators.</p>
      <p>Berhow is a half-Japanese, half-American student whose family lives in Valencia, California, about 3.2km from the school.</p>
      <p>He was a sophomore at Saugus, who ran track and field for the school and competed in the 800-metre and 1600-metre races, according to stats on Athletic.net.</p>
      <p>Surveillance footage of the young boy pulling the gun from his backpack, before firing at his classmates and then shooting himself in the head has also been uncovered.</p>

      <p>Berhow’s mother, Mami Matasuura, said she was praying for her son.</p>
      <p>“I don’t even know what to do right now, I am just praying for my son’s life,” she said.</p>
      <p>Students spoke of their terror and shock after the shooting, revealing some possible motives for Berhow’s violent act.</p>
      <p>LA Police have refused to identify the boy officially as the FBI joins their probe into why he carried out the fatal shooting.</p>
      <p>His peers have described him as “unsociable”.</p>
      <p>A childhood friend who only identified him by his first name of Ryan to KTLA, said he was quiet and introverted and had lost his father.</p>
      <p>He said the suspect’s father died about a year ago and speculated his death may have been linked to the shooting.</p>
      <p>Heavy reports Berhow’s father, Mark, died on December 5, 2017, aged 55.</p>
      <p>The media outlet also reports online records show that Mark Berhow and his wife began divorce proceedings in August 2016.</p>

      <p>Matasuura is referred to as the “petitioner” in those documents, meaning she filed for divorce. Records show that Matasuura was also filing for custody.</p>
      <p>“We were playing in the backyard … over the years we stopped talking, there was a disconnect (between us),” he said.</p>
      <p>“He was doing his own thing. It’s a shock to all of us. His father passed a year ago or something like that.”</p>
      <p>“His dad used to make bullets, so I’d assume he had bullets and stuff like that.”</p>
      <p>The weapon — a .45 semiautomatic pistol that had no remaining bullets — was recovered at the scene, Capt. Kent Wegener said.</p>
      <p>“Detectives have reviewed video that clearly shows the suspect withdraw a handgun and wound five people and shoot himself in the head,” he said.</p>
      <p>A next door neighbour, Jared Axen, told KTLA that he had known the suspect since he was a child.</p>
      <p>Mr Axen said his father used to go hunting, so firearms “weren’t a mystery to him”.</p>
      <p>“I can’t think of any red flags in our conversation, when he would think of handling his hurt in this manner,” he said.</p>
      <p>“He grew up with his father who was a hunter, and this was a normal activity for him.</p>
      <p>“He grew up around firearms, it wasn’t a mystery, he knew how to use it and understood how it worked, he was responsible. He came off as a very responsible person.”</p>
      <p>Authorities are working to obtain any other video from campus and mobile phone video from students.</p>
      <p>A White House spokesman said Donald Trump had been briefed on the shooting, but the US President had yet to make a public statement on the tragedy.</p>
      <h3>HOW THE SHOOTING UNFOLDED</h3>
      <p>The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said on Twitter that deputies responded to the shooting around 7.45am (2.45am AEDT) at Saugus High School in the city of Santa Clarita.</p>
      <p>Authorities say off-duty officers whose children went to Saugus High School in Santa Clarita were the first on scene and provided first aid to the victims.</p>
      <p>Collyn Nielson with the William S. Hart Union High School District says initial reports indicate teachers and students “knew what to do” and immediately barricaded themselves in classrooms, turned out lights and hid. Nielson says schools hold lockdown drills three times a year.</p>
      <p>He said in addition to one sheriff’s deputy Saugus High School has nine “campus supervisors” who act as security guards.</p>
      <p>There are a dozen security cameras and no metal detectors.</p>
      <p>Student Rosie Rodriguez said she was walking up the library stairs when she heard noises that “sounded like balloons” popping.</p>
      <p>She realised they were gunshots when she saw other students running.</p>
      <p>Still carrying a backpack laden with books, she ran across the street to a home, where a person she didn’t know gave shelter to her and about 10 other students.</p>
      <p>“I just heard a lot of kids crying. We were scared,” Ms Rodriguez said.</p>
      <p>On a normal day, she said, Saugus High School felt very safe.</p>
      <p>“We never really thought this would happen in our school,” she said.</p>

      <p>Henry Mayo Newhall Hospital tweeted that one female patient was dead, two males were in critical condition and one male was in good condition.</p>
      <p>It was unclear if there were any others injured.</p>
      <p>Initial reports fluctuated as high as six.</p>
      <p>The sheriff’s office said the suspect was in custody and being treated, an hour-and-a-half after reports of the shooting first surfaced.</p>
      <p>He was reported to be a 15-year-old student from the school, of Asian appearance, and wearing dark clothing.</p>
      <p>Another student said she initially mistook gunshots for instruments in a band class.</p>
      <p>Shauna Orandi was in her Spanish class working on homework when she heard gunfire.</p>
      <p>She said she thought her worst nightmare had come true.</p>
      <p>She said to herself: “This is it. I’m gonna die.”</p>
      <p>She was later escorted from the school and reunited with her father in a nearby park.</p>
      <p>Saugus High School and other schools in the area were locked down.</p>
      <p>That lockdown was later lifted.</p>
      <p>Television images showed police swarming the school and several people being moved on ambulance stretchers.</p>
      <p>Lines of students were escorted from the school by armed police.</p>

      <p>“We are all really upset. This is a peaceful neighbourhood and this is shocking. The kids are texting all of their friends and trying to figure out who the victims are.”</p>

      <h3>AMERICA REACTS TO THE SHOOTING</h3>
      <p>Actress Kristy Swanson, who starred in<i> Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i>, tweeted that she knows two students who attend the school, one of whom was barricaded in a classroom.</p>
      <p>She tweeted her young friend Madi was “barricaded in a classroom” but “OK”.</p>
      <p>Ellen DeGeneres tweeted that “my heart is with the community of Santa Clarita and Saugus High School”, while US talk show host Ryan Seacrest implored Americans to not “grow numb to this violence”.</p>
      <p>Democratic politicians also took to twitter to condemn the latest shooting, which has become an indictment on the ruling party’s inability to make serious gun reform changes.</p>
      <p>Democratic Presidential nominee frontrunner Elizabeth Warren said, “We shouldn’t have to live like this. Students shouldn’t live in fear when they go to school.”</p>
      <p>Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, had a crack at Republicans, tweeting, “What will it take for Republicans to stop blocking efforts to #EndGunViolence?”</p>
      <p>Kamala Harris said, “Our children and communities are being terrorised. We can’t accept this.”</p>
      <p>Bernie Sanders said: “We have a moral obligation to say: children’s lives are more important than gun manufacturers’ profits. We must pass common sense gun safety legislation.”</p>
