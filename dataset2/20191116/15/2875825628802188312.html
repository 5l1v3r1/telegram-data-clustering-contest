      <h1>Paul Merson insists Arsenal must consider Chris Wilder as Unai Emery replacement</h1>
      <h2>Arsenal boss Unai Emery is under pressure in north London and Gunners legend Paul Merson believes Chris Wilder would be a good replacement</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T15:17:42+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 15:17</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal legend Paul Merson believes Chris Wilder should be in contention to replace Unai Emery in north London.</p>
      <p>Emery finds himself under pressure after a difficult start to the Premier League campaign.</p>
      <p>He still retains the backing of the board but <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> sit sixth, eight points adrift of the top four during the international break.</p>
      <p>Sheffield United, who beat the Gunners at Bramall Lane last month, are ahead of them on goal difference with Wilder doing a wonderful job.</p>
      <p>And if Emery does find himself out of a job, Merson believes Wilder should be under consideration.</p>

      <p>"Chris Wilder has done a fantastic job at Sheffield United and deserves a crack at a really big job at some point," <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/spurs-arsenal-told-consider-sheffield-20892125">he told the Daily Star.</a></p>
      <p>“I think they have actually been a bit unlucky in some games this season but to see them up there in fifth is phenomenal.</p>
      <p>“I watched them play Arsenal and there was only one team who knew what they were doing. Arsenal had no idea. That’s good coaching.</p>
      <p>“Managers like Unai Emery and Manuel Pellegrini are under pressure, and okay, you never know for sure if a manager can make such a big step up.</p>
      <p>“But Chris Wilder has got to be in the conversation the next time a big job comes up. He deserves it.”</p>

      <p>Arsenal return to action after the international break with a visit of struggling <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> .</p>
      <p>They will hope to have clawed the gap on the top four back ahead of the festive period with clashes against Norwich, <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> to come.</p>
      <p>The Gunners do however have to take on <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> , United, <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> over Christmas and new year.</p>
