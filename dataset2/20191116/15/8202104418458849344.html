      <h3>No one likes to deal with a dirty diaper, but Pop + Tot Cloth Diapering Service is ready and willing to deal with the mess for you.</h3>
      <p>Of course, you still have to change the diapers yourself, but, instead of tossing disposables in the trash — where they can take around 500 years to decompose — simply put the soiled cloth diaper inserts into the provided diaper pail and twice-weekly, like magic, the dirty ones will disappear and new, clean inserts will be delivered.</p>
      <p>The idea to start the subscription diaper service was born after business owners Alex Archer and Tyson Schultz welcomed their daughter into the world in 2018. The young parents were already dedicated to the sustainability of cloth diapers but were not as excited about the work that went into laundering them.</p>
      <p>“There were so many times when we just said to each other that we would love to just pay anyone to do this for us,” Schultz said laughing.</p>
      <p>So, when they went online to search for a diaper service and didn’t find what they were looking for, they decided to fill the gap themselves.</p>
      <p>The duo’s business model is that of a subscription service with multiple options and price points so customers get as much, or as little, as they need. They have even partnered with Little Bum Baby — another local business — to provide premium, natural and cloth diaper safe baby care products in their subscriptions.</p>
      <p>“There are different tiers we have that come with some higher-end products like the creams or the (diaper) pail,” Schultz said.</p>
      <p>But, if you’re not interested in a subscription they also offer the option to purchase a package upfront — which makes it a perfect baby shower or Christmas gift for your favourite new parents.</p>
      <p>Though the pair knows disposable diapers are the first choice for many parents — and they admit there are times were disposable is better, such as while travelling — Archer and Schultz really want to change that attitude and help others see the many benefits of cloth diapering.</p>
      <p>“What it comes back to is the world we are leaving for our kids,” Archer said. “Each one of us has a part to play and this is a step that we can take in our lives, in cloth diapering our own daughter, and also supporting others in cloth diapering to reduce the amount of waste that we produce. We also know the aim of the city of Saskatoon is to reduce the amount of waste going to the landfill, so every family who has young children can also play a part in reducing that waste.”</p>
      <p>But, not only are cloth diapers more environmentally friendly, but they also contain the mess better — thanks to the strong elastic tops on both the insert and the diaper cover — have a lower risk of diaper rash and, best of all, help kids potty-train sooner than their counterparts using disposables.</p>
      <p>“They look great and are way cuter than disposables but they are also comfier and you potty train earlier,” Schultz explained. “If your baby is using cloth they feel when they are wet as opposed to the disposables which just suck the moisture into the SAPs (super absorbent polymer) … and when kids don’t feel wet when they are peeing, they aren’t able to put two and two together.”</p>
      <p>And using Pop + Tot’s unbleached cotton inserts also means no excess chemicals or dyes coming into contact with your child’s skin.</p>
      <p>Regardless of the benefits, Archer notes that there may still be some hesitance in embracing cloth diapers thanks to memories of the rubber pants — and the diaper rashes that accompanied them because of unbreathable material — that used to be required when cloth diapers were used in the past.</p>
      <p>“They ain’t your mother’s cloth diapers,” Archer finished with a laugh. “They are so much more modern, they have really come a long way since we were kids.”</p>
