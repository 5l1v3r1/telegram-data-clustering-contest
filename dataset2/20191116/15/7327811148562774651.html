      <p>WESTBURY, Long Island -- A prosecutor says a Nicaraguan judge has sentenced a man to 30 years behind bars in the <a href="http://abc7ny.com/police-investigate-killing-of-college-student-from-long-island/3198694/">killing of a young nursing student </a>in upstate New York.</p>
      <p>Broome County District Attorney Steve Cornwell said on Friday that defendant Orlando Tercero received the maximum prison sentence under Nicaraguan law in the 2018 killing of 22-year-old Haley Anderson.</p>
      <p>Authorities said Tercero strangled Anderson at his off-campus residence in Binghamton and then fled to Nicaragua. The Central American country rejected an extradition request from the U.S. but instead decided to try him. The Binghamton Press &amp; Sun-Bulletin previously reported that the defense argued he may have been provoked.</p>
      <p>The trial marked an exceedingly rare legal proceeding in which the defendant was prosecuted under Nicaragua's legal system for a slaying on American soil.</p>
