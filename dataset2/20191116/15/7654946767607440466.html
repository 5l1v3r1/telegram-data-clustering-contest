      <p>A petition shared by Queens Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/13/aoc-calls-on-stephen-miller-to-resign-over-leaked-emails/">demanding the resignation</a> of Stephen Miller now has more than 20,000 signatures.</p>
      <p>“Leaked emails show Stephen Miller peddling white nationalist conspiracy theories, ranting about “white genocide” and obsessing over the loss of Confederate monuments in the wake of Dylann Roof’s South Carolina terror attack, <a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1195488129479847936">she said</a>.</p>
      <p>“Now he’s in the White House directing mass human rights abuses against immigrants at the border, from family separations to child detentions. We cannot allow white nationalists in the White House. Sign below to call for Stephen Miller’s immediate resignation,” AOC added.</p>
      <p>The congresswoman has long been a persistent and frequent critic of Miller and his hardline immigration policies.</p>
