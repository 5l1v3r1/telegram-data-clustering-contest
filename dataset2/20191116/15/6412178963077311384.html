        <b>Jamaican stars Kevon Lambert and Junior Flemmings could be on the move to England, with the help of Chelsea legend Didier Drogba, we can reveal.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The international pair have been playing in America for Phoenix Rising – the club Drogba is a co-owner of – and he believes they could both have a future in England.</p>
      <p>Striker Flemmings, 23, bagged 23 goals last season, whilst Lambert, 22, is a 6ft 3in midfielder, who is very highly regarded.</p>
      <p>Both players are full internationals for Jamaica – who are now ranked back in the world’s top-50, which makes them appealing to English clubs as they could very well get work permits.</p>
      <p>Drogba has asked his former club <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/chelsea"><b>Chelsea</b></a> to take a look, whilst it is believed West Ham, Crystal Palace and Reading are also keen on the duo.</p>
