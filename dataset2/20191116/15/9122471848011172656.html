      <h1>LeBron’s Instagram Post About His Big Dunk Is Ruthless</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T15:13:56+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 15:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>Eventually, LeBron James will no longer be a dominant force in the NBA. That time hasn’t come yet though, as the four-time MVP continues to shine in his 17th season.</p>
      <p>The Los Angeles Lakers own a 10-2 record and look quite impressive this season in large part because of James. He isn’t showing any signs of slowing down as he’s averaging 24.3 points and 11.1 assists per game.</p>
      <p>Last night, the 34-year-old superstar threw down a ferocious dunk on Kings forward Nemanja Bjelica. Fans in the Staples Center went into a frenzy over the move.</p>
      <p>After the game was over James went on social media to share an image of his jaw-dropping dunk.</p>
      <p>James posted a ruthless message on Instagram with the following caption: “Y’all wanna see a dead body???? Me either so I let him keep standing! Ha!”</p>
      <p>Here’s the post, via his Instagram account:</p>

      <p>James received a ton of criticism last season for missing the playoffs. Clearly he’s on a mission to prove his doubters wrong.</p>
      <p>It might come off as a disrespectful post from James, but it doesn’t sound like he has any issues with Bjelica.</p>
      <p>Fans can watch James and the Lakers on Sunday night when they host the Atlanta Hawks.</p>
