      <p>Finally, the much-awaited night by the music lovers is here. While Katy touched the Indian grounds a few days back, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Dua-Lipa">Dua Lipa</a> landed here in Mumbai today. Today the two, very popular singers joined hands with other Indian singers for a musical concert which is held in Navi Mumbai today.</p>
      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Karan-Johar">Karan Johar</a> hosted a special bash for <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Katy-Perry">Katy Perry</a> and B-town graced it with full enthusiasm. Also, the king Khan had a special meeting with Lipa Dua today ahead of this musical concert and extended his wishes for the night. While browsing social media, we stumbled upon a few photographs from the concert and they are simply breath-taking.</p>
      <p>While Katy addressed the crowd, "Today, I will sing every song you love," says Katy Perry, Dua asked the crowd how excited they are for the night. She said, "Mumbai, how you feeling? I am so excited. I didn't imagine there will be so many people. Are you ready for the party?"</p>
      <p>Reportedly, Katy performed on a few famous songs of hers and audiences had a good time dancing and singing along with the star. On the other hand, Dua Lipa sang her brand new song "Dancing With Somebody" and "One Kiss" for the concert.</p>
