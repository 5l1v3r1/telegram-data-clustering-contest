      <p>Sun City - <b>Erik van Rooyen</b>Â revealed his disappointment despite finishing under par following his third round at the <b>Nedbank Golf Challenge</b> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old posted a 2-under par 70 to sit T17 at 3-under par heading into the final round.</p>

      <p>Van Rooyen had a flawless front nine and failed to drop a shot as he managed to score three birdies.</p>
      <p>However, the South African was left frustrated as he produced three bogeys and two birdies on the back nine.</p>
      <p>"It's just been that kind of week for me so far, some really good stuff but I'm a bit disappointed and frustrated," Van Rooyen told <b>Sport24 </b>on Saturday.</p>
      <p>"I would've loved to shoot a few under par on the back nine to be a bit closer but I can still go and shoot low tomorrow."</p>
      <p>On Saturday at the Gary Player Country Club, no golfer signed a bogey-free round and Van Rooyen admitted that it is a really tough golf course.</p>
      <p>"It's just a really tough golf course, it doesn't give you much. You have to hit it really well to make birdies that's why you can tell the leaders haven't really run away with it," he said.</p>
      <p>Despite being a bit lower down the leaderboard, Van Rooyen admitted that his plan for Sunday's final round will be birdies and more birdies.</p>
      <p>"I don't know what the guys ahead are going to do, they might be extremely nervous and mess that up or they might play really well. But I can't focus on that I just got to make as many birdies as I can," he said.</p>
      <p>"It's a frustrating one but there's more golf to be played."</p>
      <p>Van Rooyen has already booked his spot for next week's European Tour final, the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai.</p>
