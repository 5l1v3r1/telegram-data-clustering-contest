      <p>The grieving family of Brendan Grace have paid tribute to the comic legend and described their “last supper” with him in hospital.</p>
      <p>Brendan’s widow Eileen and their two daughters, Amanda and Melanie, have said they enjoyed a Chinese takeaway as their last meal with Brendan - but they didn’t realise how close he was to the end.</p>
      <p>The beloved funnyman passed away in July 11 at the age of 68, following a short battle with lung cancer, spending his final days in The Galway Clinic.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the Late Late Show on Friday night, Eileen described their last meal with him in hospital: “That was on the Sunday. He had been told on the Friday that his time was near.</p>
      <p>“We didn’t know that till that Monday, so it was only afterwards we heard this,” Eileen said.</p>

      <p>“And when he sat down to have that meal with us that night, he knew that his time was nearer than what we knew.”</p>
      <p>Daughter Melanie told show host Ryan Tubridy that they tried to make the meal a bit of an occasion.</p>
      <p>She said: “We set it up in the cafeteria, and Amanda went out and got balloons and plates, and we put all the tables together. It was the last day that he walked down that hallway with us.</p>
      <p>“We didn’t know that at the time and we all just sat at that table and we had a big Chinese meal and we talked and we cried and we laughed, and we considered it the last supper.”</p>

      <p>Melanie said it was hard to tell just how sick her father was, as he appeared to be very much alive and well.</p>
      <p>She said: “Every single time that we thought something was near, he’d wake up the next day, and the breakfast would be there and the lunch would be there.</p>
      <p>“And at one point we said to ourselves, ‘I think we need a re-diagnosis here’.”</p>
      <p>“He seemed so well for a sick man.”</p>

      <p>Referring to her father’s love of Maltesers, Melanie added: “The consultant said he was the only cancer patient that he had seen who managed to gain a stone and a half in hospital - and we all gained it with him.</p>
      <p>“Maltesers went out of business. If you couldn’t get Maltesers that week, there was a reason for it - we had them all.”</p>
