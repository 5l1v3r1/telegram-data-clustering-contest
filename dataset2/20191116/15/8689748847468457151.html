      <p>Fameye has torn Awal into shreds for badmouthing him recently when he said he took away his ¢500 for a no-show for their music video.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.ghbase.com/awal-calls-fameye-fraudster-after-chopping-his-gh%C2%A2500-failing-to-show-on-set-for-video-shoot/">Few days ago,</a> Awal revealed the ‘Nothing I Get’ hit maker charged him the said amount to shoot a music video with him but failed to honour his part of the bargain when he got the money.</p>

      <p>Fameye has responded in a brutal fashion, calling a Awal a ‘Talented Kid’ who does not deserve his attention.</p>
      <p>He said Awal is disrespectful and for someone who extended that uncouth behavior to people like Sarkodie, he’s not surprised he’s accusing him of something he knows nothing about.</p>
      <p>Fameye, whose interview was captured by Nkosuo TV, said he does not want to talk about the Awal issue because he has no dealings with him whatsoever.</p>
      <p>He then concluded by saying he has not any money from Awal and that the ‘small boy’ is just eager for fame.</p>
