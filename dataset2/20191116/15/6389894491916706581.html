      <p>Labour’s plans to nationalise BT’s digital arm to provide free internet would be illegal under European Union state aid rules according to the Conservative Party.</p>
      <p>The opposition pledged this week to provide the public and businesses throughout the country with free full-fibre broadband by 2030.</p>

      <p>But the £20bn plan was met with scepticism by BT, which said it would cost nearer £40bn.</p>
      <p>Today the Conservative Party has said it would likely be illegal under EU law too and as such is at conflict with Labour’s desire to remain in the bloc.</p>
      <p>“Their intervention will almost certainly fly in the face of EU state aid rules under EU law,” the Conservatives said in a statement. “Corbyn’s broadband plan will almost certainly be illegal under EU law.” </p>
      <p>Leader Jeremy Corbyn has insisted Labour will renegotiate a Brexit deal and then hold a second EU referendum if his party wins the general election on 12 December.</p>

      <p>In that campaign Labour has suggested it would back Remain, but the Tories believe staying in the EU would make Labour’s plans to nationalise part of BT impossible.</p>
      <p>They added in a statement: “Corbyn’s Labour won’t be able to introduce their scheme unless they ditch their plan to extend Britain’s membership of the EU and abandon their plans to hold a chaotic second referendum.”</p>
