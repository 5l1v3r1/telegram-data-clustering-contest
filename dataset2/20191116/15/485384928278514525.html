      <h1>Yuendumu police shooting sees officer Zachary Rolfe charged with murder, but what happens next?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T15:25:41+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 15:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/lauren-roberts/11604226" target="_blank">Lauren Roberts</a></address>
      <p>"Justice for Walker" was emblazoned on banners and chanted at protests around the country this week after the death in custody of 19-year-old Kumanjayi Walker in the Indigenous community of Yuendumu.</p>
      <p>One week ago, <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-13/police-officer-charged-with-murder-yuendumu-shooting/11702408">Mr Walker was shot by police in his home</a>.</p>
      <p>The police have said officers went there to arrest him for a breach of the conditions of his suspended sentence.</p>
      <p>NT Police has since charged one of its officers — 28-year-old Constable Zachary Rolfe — with one count of murder.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>Territory authorities have promised the community of Yuendumu there will be a thorough investigation of the events that unfolded that night.</p>
      <p>But a fundraising campaign has been launched by people connected to Yuendumu to pay for extra oversight of the official inquiries.</p>
      <p>The campaign has already attracted a $25,000 donation from a key Aboriginal group in the centre, the Tangentyere Council, which manages the town camps in Alice Springs.</p>
      <p>So, what investigations will there be into the death and what can we expect from them?</p>

      <h3>What investigations are underway or pending?</h3>
      <p>NT Chief Minister Michael Gunner said the investigations into the events which led to Mr Walker's death would be independent.</p>
      <blockquote>"There is a great deal of independence in how this process is being managed," Mr Gunner said after the shooting.</blockquote>
      <p>The NT Police investigation is being overseen by WA Police Assistant Commissioner Nick Anticich, who is already on secondment with NT Police.</p>
      <p>He will oversee the investigations run by the Major Crime Squad and the Professional Standards Command.</p>
      <p>Acting Deputy Police Commissioner Michael White says there will be oversight of those investigations by the NT Independent Commissioner Against Corruption, the Ombudsman and the coroner.</p>
      <p>Commissioner Jamie Chalker said questions would be answered "in the fullness of time" — without emotion and with objectivity.</p>
      <p>"The path we are on will be a search for the truth," he said.</p>
      <p>"Everybody must respect that anyone involved in this process is afforded natural justice.</p>
      <blockquote>"This process is free of political influence, of that you can be assured."</blockquote>

      </figure>
      <p>NT ICAC Commissioner Ken Fleming QC has also launched his own investigation, but the scope is very different.</p>
      <p>"The police are investigating the potential criminal aspects of what happened," Mr Fleming explained.</p>
      <blockquote>"They produce a brief, they send it to the Director of Public Prosecutions who makes the decisions whether or not the person will be charged — we have nothing to do with that.</blockquote>
      <p>"What we have to do with, is whether there has been improper conduct in respect to the event and the manner of which the investigation is done."</p>
      <p>Mr Fleming will look at the broader situation in Yuendumu — examining events that took place in the leadup to the shooting last Saturday, such as health workers leaving the community.</p>
      <p>There was no medical assistance for Mr Walker in Yuendumu that night because the local clinic staff had been evacuated over safety concerns and break-ins.</p>
      <p>Mr Fleming said he may release some of his findings in the coming weeks, but will not be able to hand down any conclusions which may affect a potential criminal trial.</p>
      <p>"We watch, we talk and we can make suggestions," he said.</p>
      <p>"We haven't seen any impropriety whatsoever in what has been done so far — the police have conducted these matters impeccably and quickly."</p>

      <p>A death in custody automatically prompts a coronial inquest, which will be open to the public but won't be heard until after any criminal proceedings are dealt with.</p>
      <p>Evidence which comes out in court may be considered by NT coroner Greg Cavanagh.</p>
      <p>Monash University Faculty of Law senior lecturer Stephen Gray said the future inquest could also take into account Mr Walker's life history — right back to his birth and his parents' upbringing.</p>
      <p>Mr Cavanagh may also look into Constable Rolfe's background and his experiences as an NT Police officer, Dr Gray said.</p>
      <p>"In a coronial inquest, they're basically trying to find a cause of death," he said.</p>
      <blockquote>"They could make recommendations to try to avoid these things happening in future."</blockquote>
      <h3>What's next in the criminal investigation?</h3>
      <p>Constable Rolfe is suspended with pay, he was granted bail this week and is currently in Canberra.</p>
      <p>On December 19, he will return to court in the Alice Springs Local Court for a brief mention and a time will be set for the next hearing.</p>
      <p>The NT Police Association has indicated Constable Rolfe will plead not guilty.</p>
      <p>The hearing held after December 19 will be a directions hearing — which will update the court on how the case is progressing.</p>
      <p>It is likely to be at least another year before any potential criminal trial begins.</p>
      <p>If the case proceeded to a criminal trial, Constable Rolfe would likely be tried in the Supreme Court, as most cases in the Northern Territory which attract a jail term of more than two years are heard there.</p>

      <p>Criminal Lawyers Association of the NT president Marty Aust said in the NT's Supreme Court there was no option to have a judge-only trial, which meant if a criminal case went ahead, it would be before a jury.</p>
      <p>If a criminal case proceeds, Mr Aust said it was "very hard to know how long" a potential criminal trial would take.</p>
      <p>"Generally with murders or other matters when someone has passed away, there's a lot of medical evidence, there might be eyewitness evidence, there might be video evidence — it's very difficult to tell how long these matters take," he said.</p>
      <p>"But it's very important that a proper investigation is done."</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Mr Aust also said that Constable Rolfe, like all Australians, had the presumption of innocence.</p>
      <p>Dr Gray said it was not that unusual for a police officer to be charged over a death in custody but he was not aware of any cases where there had been a conviction.</p>
      <blockquote>"That's never happened as far as I know."</blockquote>
      <p>In one example, in October 2003, Robert Jongmin was shot to death by then-acting sergeant Robert Whittington in the remote Territory community of Wadeye.</p>
      <p>Initially, Sergeant Whittington was charged with murder, but the charges were later quashed because they were not laid within two months of the incident, as required by the Territory's Police Administration Act.</p>
      <h3>What is the Yuendumu community asking for?</h3>
      <p>An online fundraiser to help ensure an independent inquiry into the police shooting has raised more than $70,000 in two days.</p>
      <p>Organisers say the money will pay for lawyers to travel to Yuendumu to "facilitate an independent inquiry into the shooting" and will also cover "associated forensic expertise" as part of the investigation.</p>
      <p>Warlpiri elder Ned Hargraves welcomed the funds, which he said would help pay for legal costs.</p>
      <p>He said while he did trust the official NT Police investigation, the community wanted a second investigation to ensure the truth came out.</p>
      <p>"I'm really glad that we are doing this," Mr Hargraves said.</p>
      <blockquote>"We like an independent investigation with this fundraising."</blockquote>

      <p>The distrust of the official legal process did not surprise Dr Gray.</p>
      <p>"Almost every time an Indigenous person dies in custody there is intense mistrust," he said.</p>
      <p>"The police are the ones that investigate themselves so there's a problem with the independence.</p>
      <p>"It's only natural in a sense that the family and the community are upset."</p>
      <p>Dr Gray said the story had resonated across the world.</p>
      <blockquote>"The killing of a person in custody — especially an Aboriginal person — that's an issue that's hugely controversial for a long time," he said.</blockquote>
      <p>"There's a long history of Indigenous people dying in police custody or prisons, it was the subject of a royal commission back in 1991.</p>
      <p>"There's a sense of 'oh no, not again, is it going to keep on happening?'"</p>
      <p>Mr Fleming said he understood why some members of the community did not trust the process.</p>
      <p>"Some in the community are a bit sceptical as to what is a blue-on-blue investigation, so we as an independent body are looking at what the police has done in respect of that," he said.</p>
      <p>In a statement, the organisers of the campaign raising funds for an independent inquiry said they would be pushing for an examination of broader issues affecting Aboriginal communities "especially around policing".</p>
