      <p><b>Matchup: <a href="https://www.nhl.com/sabres/stats/">Buffalo Sabres</a></b> (9-6-3) vs. <b><a href="https://www.nhl.com/senators/stats">Ottawa Senators</a> </b>(8-10-1)<br/><b>Where</b>: KeyBank Center<br/><b>When:</b> 7:25 p.m faceoff due to Hockey Night in Canada broadcast and pregame Hockey Fights Cancer Night ceremonies<br/><b>TV:</b> MSG<br/><b>Radio:</b> WGR 550</p>
      <p><b>Long-awaited debut:</b> The local analytics community howled on June 25, 2016, when then-Sabres GM Tim Murray made a deal just before the start of the second day of the NHL Draft in KeyBank Center. Defenseman Mark Pysyk, the longtime darling of the numbers crowd, was sent to Florida along with a couple draft picks for Dmitry Kulikov and a second-round pick.</p>
      <p>Murray thus moved up from No. 38 to No. 33 to get the man he wanted – Swedish center Rasmus Asplund. Kulikov had a disastrous one-season run in Buffalo while Pysyk remains in Florida but has been in and out of the lineup as a healthy scratch.</p>
      <p>For his part, right until he was fired after the 2016-17 season, Murray insisted the deal was about moving up to get Asplund and always felt the Swede would develop into a strong two-way player in the Buffalo lineup.</p>
      <p>We get our first look at Asplund tonight as the 21-year-old will make his NHL debut for the Sabres against the visiting Ottawa Senators. He will become the seventh player this season to make his Buffalo debut – but the first of that group to play their initial game in the NHL. Johan Larsson remains day to day with an upper body injury.</p>
      <p>"You're just looking back at all the workouts you did in all the summers past," said Asplund, who noted his family will be watching on TV back home at Sweden with the opening faceoff well past 1 a.m. "There's a lot of emotions going. I don't even know if I'm happy, nervous all at the same time."</p>
      <p>"We're looking forward to seeing him step in here today. He's ready," said coach Ralph Krueger. "It's a big hole to fill but we think Rasmus is more than ready for this opportunity. ... We haven't given him a big to-do list. The positive thing is training camp, all the principles and concepts have been laid out for him. They're working with the same language in Rochester."</p>
      <p>A big part of Asplund's emotion is rooted in tonight's celebration of Hockey Fights Cancer Night. He lost both of his paternal grandparents to the disease, with his grandfather passing away shortly after he returned home following the 2016 draft.</p>
      <p>"I visited him all of May every day, went to the draft, got home and he passed away the day after I got home," Asplund said. "He basically waited for me to get home from the draft, show him the draft jersey and all that. So this is pretty big, emotional for me and my family."</p>

      <p><b>The lineup</b>: Linus Ullmark (3-3-1, 3.12/.915) will be in goal as the Sabres try to snap their 0-4-2 slide. They will use the same six defensemen they did Thursday against Carolina, with Colin Miller and John Gilmour being healthy scratches. The most recent defense pairs had Jake McCabe with Rasmus Ristolainen, Rasmus Dahlin with Brandon Montour and Marco Scandella with Henri Jokiharju.</p>

      <p><b>Captain Jack looks to bounce back</b>: Sabres captain Jack Eichel has one goal in the last five games and that was his last-minute garbage-time tally in the second game in Sweden against Tampa Bay. Seeing the Senators on the other side might be what he needs. Eichel has 19 points (5-14) in 13 career games against Ottawa. The 19 points and 1.46 per game against Ottawa are his most against any NHL opponent.</p>
      <p><b>Sens Report:</b> Universally picked to finish 31st this season in a total rebuild under new coach D.J. Smith, Ottawa has been much better than expected. The Sens have won two in a row, including Friday's 2-1 home win over Philadelphia, and four of their last five. They have given up only six goals in the four wins while the loss was an 8-2 stinker Monday in Carolina. The Sens are 6-4 at home and only 2-6-1 on the road, but coming off a 4-2 win Wednesday in New Jersey in their last game away from Canadian Tire Centre.</p>
      <p><b>Old friends report:</b> Sens goalie Anders Nilsson, who was the NHL's First Star of the Week last week, stopped 26 of 27 Philadelphia shots in Friday's win to improve to 5-4-1, 2.76/.925. Robin Lehner's backup in Buffalo for the 2016-17 season will likely sit tonight on the back to back and give way to Craig Anderson (3-6-0, 3.33/.893), who has been excellent in his career against the Sabres (17-9-2, 2.34/.928).</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Tyler Ennis scored his fourth goal of the season Friday night and has eight points in 19 games after signing a one-year, $800,000 contract as a free agent on July 1 following a stint last season in Toronto. He also has a team-worst minus-11 rating. Ennis, who turned 30 on Oct. 6, is the last player to score a game-winning goal for the Sabres in the playoffs. It was his overtime goal in Game 5 that gave the Sabres a 3-2 lead in their first-round series at Philadelphia on April 22, 2011. The Sabres lost the next two games to drop the series and haven't been back in the postseason since.</p>

      <p><b>Best player nobody talks about:</b> That would describe Ottawa center Jean-Gabriel Pageau, who 11 goals on the season – and leads the NHL in plus-minus with a plus-19. That's a pretty remarkable stat for someone on a losing team. Pageau had a hat trick in Wednesday's 4-2 win at New Jersey.</p>
      <p><b>Numbers games:</b>  The Sabres' penalty kill has slipped to 27th in the NHL and is just 5 for 10 the last three games. The power play has dropped to ninth and is in a 0-for-12 slump the last five games. ... Tonight opens the fifth of Buffalo's 14 sets of back-to-back games – and the Sabres are 0-4 in the opener of each one.  They play Sunday night in Chicago. ... Curtis Lazar played 176 games for Ottawa from 2014-17 after being the Sens' first-round pick in 2013. He had 12 goals and 24 assists. ... Lazar became the 56th player in Sabres history to score in his debut game for Buffalo, the first since Kyle Okposo did it in 2016 at Edmonton. ... Thursday's loss to Carolina was the Sabres' 200th regular-season defeat in either overtime or a shootout. Buffalo is 198-200 in those games. ... It was 45 years ago tonight – Nov. 16, 1974 – that Rick Martin scored the 1,000th goal in Sabres history in a 7-5 loss at Boston.</p>
      <p><b>Busy, busy:</b> Today is one of two days on this season's NHL calendar that will see 30 of the 31 teams in action, with the other being the season finale day on April 4. Only Columbus is idle today.</p>
      <p>In other Atlantic Division games today, Tampa Bay hosts Winnipeg, Boston hosts Washington (after the Caps lost a 13-game point streak last night against Montreal), Montreal hosts New Jersey, Florida hosts the New York Rangers, Toronto is at Sidney Crosby-less Pittsburgh and Detroit is at San Jose.</p>
