        <li>Americans who work with a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/financial-advisor">financial adviser</a> are more optimistic about their financial situation, despite believing a recession is imminent, according to <a href="https://www.cfp.net/docs/default-source/news-events---research-facts-figures/190942-74-cfp-recession-deck-d4-jjm.pdf">a CFP Board survey</a>.</li>
        <li>Sixty-seven percent of people who work with an adviser feel financially prepared for an economic downturn, compared to 38% of those who don't have professional help.</li>
        <li>It's nearly impossible to recession-proof your money, but a good financial planner or investment adviser can help you protect it. </li>

      <p>There's a lot of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/smart-things-people-with-financial-advisors-do-with-money">upside to working with a financial adviser</a>, especially if you're worried about what the future holds.</p>
      <p>In partnership with Morning Consult, the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards (CFP Board) <a href="https://www.cfp.net/docs/default-source/news-events---research-facts-figures/190942-74-cfp-recession-deck-d4-jjm.pdf">surveyed</a> 2,200 Americans and found that just over half (55%) believe a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/best-advice-for-a-recession-focus-on-what-you-control">recession</a> is going to happen in the United States within the next year. </p>
      <p>The survey revealed that despite worries about the economy, those who work with a professional to manage their money appear to be in better shape. Two-thirds of the respondents who work with a financial adviser — a catch-all term that generally includes <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/financial-planner">financial planners</a> and investment advisers — say they feel financially prepared for a recession, compared to just 38% of those who go it alone.</p>
      <p>Not only do they feel more prepared, an even greater share feel positive. Seventy-eight percent of people who have a financial adviser report feeling optimistic about their personal or household financial situation. Of those who work specifically with a certified financial planner (CFP), 85% feel optimistic.</p>
      <p>If a recession did occur, 77% of the respondents who work with a financial adviser say they feel confident that person would successfully manage their money. </p>
      <p>An economic downturn can have wide-ranging effects on your financial health, from job insecurity to investment losses. Managing cash flow, paying down high-interest debt, and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/high-yield-savings-emergency-fund-2019-8">building up an emergency fund</a> are a few fundamentals that become even more <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-prepare-for-a-recession-financial-planner-advice-2019-8">important to prioritize</a> ahead of a recession, and a financial planner can offer guidance and an action plan for doing so.</p>
      <p>Folks <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-plan-for-retirement-in-10-years-2019-4">nearing retirement</a> can work with an adviser to adjust their investment strategy, and those gearing up to make a big purchase, such as paying for a college education or buying a home, can talk through alternative options.</p>
      <p>At the end of the day, it's nearly impossible to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/biggest-sign-your-money-will-survive-a-recession-2019-8">recession-proof your money</a>, but a good financial planner or investment adviser can help you protect it.</p>
