      <p>Stargazers and budding astronomers will be looking to the sky tonight in the hope of catching a glimpse of the spectacular Leonid meteor shower.</p>
      <p>The annual light show, which is known for being bright and clear, will peak over the UK this weekend with up to 15 shooting stars every hour.</p>
      <p>The shower is due to to get busier through the evening on Saturday, November 16, and peak after 12 midnight, <a href="https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/leonid-meteor-shower-peak-over-3542914">Hull Live reports</a> .</p>
      <p>Space agency NASA is advising viewers to look to the west in order to get the best view, but a nearly full moon and the recent bad weather could make seeing it harder than in previous years.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, tonight and tomorrow is expected to be mostly cloudy and occasionally misty. However, according to the Met Office, more southern areas of the Midlands will have clear spells which could make for good viewing conditions.</p>
      <p>If you don't get to see the shower tonight, then don't worry, the best view is forecast to be in 2034, when an estimated 2,000 meteors an hour will crash across the sky.</p>
      <p>The Geminids shower will also be around in about a month with about 120 meteors per hour</p>
