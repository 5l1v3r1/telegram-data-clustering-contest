      <h1>Why sharps pounced early on Navy over Notre Dame</h1>

      <p>A week ago, sharps bet Notre Dame on the road against an outmatched Duke offense that had been struggling in litmus tests. This week, early smart money faded the No. 16 Fighting Irish in a similar price range at home against a much more dangerous threat in No. 21 Navy (2:30 p.m., NBC).</p>
      <p>Why the interest in Navy at early lines? Weren’t sharps impressed by Notre Dame’s 38-7 win at Duke that covered the spread by 24 points?</p>
      <p>Sharps know Navy’s vaunted option attack will run over, through, and around defenses that aren’t prepared. The Midshipmen are 7-1 straight up this season against a schedule featuring a slew of vulnerable defenses. They’re 6-2 against the spread, with the misses coming by two points versus Memphis, and 1¹/₂ points against Tulane. Bowl-bound Navy’s just a few points away from a perfect 8-0 mark against market prices.</p>
      <p>Notre Dame’s rush defense has been disappointing. According to college football statistical reference site cfbstats.com:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Notre Dame ranks 52nd in yards-per-carry-allowed (3.94)</li>
        <li>Notre Dame ranks 62nd in yards-allowed-per-game (155.6)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Not horrible, but not very good by national standards. Navy has a chance to compete for the full 60 minutes, or to rally in garbage time against a rush defense of that caliber.</p>
      <p>Professional bettors do their homework. They were ready to attack early lines this week. Circa Sports was first up on the board last Sunday with Notre Dame -11. That dropped quickly, with the wise guys taking Navy +11, +10, +9, and so on across the globe until reaching a market floor of +7. Irish interest started to show at the key number, causing a midweek bounce up to 7¹/₂.</p>
      <p>Up to kickoff, we may see a war games battle between Notre Dame at -7 and Navy at +7¹/₂ or higher if squares back one of their favorite teams on game day.</p>
      <p>In other Saturday matchups involving ranked teams:</p>
      <p>No. 5 Georgia visits No. 13 Auburn (3:30 p.m., CBS) in an SEC showdown that should draw heavy betting interest. Through the week, the line has moved between Georgia -2¹/₂ and Auburn +3. Sharps definitely like this talented home underdog with the full three.</p>
      <p>No. 7 Minnesota travels to No. 23 Iowa (4 p.m., Fox) in a Big Ten battle that’s been sitting at Iowa -3 all week. Recreational bettors and sharps may look for more enticing options. Will Minnesota come out flat after upsetting Penn State?</p>
      <p>No. 10 Oklahoma hosts No. 12 Baylor (7:30 p.m., ABC) in a quirky Big 12 affair featuring an undefeated host possibly closing as a double-digit underdog. Baylor is still technically alive for a national playoff berth despite being power-rated well off the pace. Sharps betting early liked Oklahoma at anything below -10. Dog lovers are lying in wait for a higher price.</p>
      <p>Have you done your homework? Can the defenses you plan to bet disrupt opposing offenses? Are you in sync with the sharps, or about to sink with the squares?</p>
