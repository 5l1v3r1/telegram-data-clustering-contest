        <b>SCOTLAND nicked the win in Nicosia.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Aston Villa's John McGinn netted his fifth goal in five games as Steve Clarke’s side stunned Cyprus.</p>

      <p>Ryan Christie fired an early opener before George Efram made it 1-1 at the start of the second half.</p>
      <p>But McGinn won the points with a volley.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/298595/scotland-football-team/">Scotland</a> should have been behind after only six minutes and had there been VAR or goal-line technology to assist the officials then Clarke’s team would have been.</p>
      <p>Efrem smashed a shot from the edge of the penalty box which hit the underside of the crossbar and bounced down and in.</p>

      <p>But thankfully for Scotland the Austrian referee, Harald Lechner, and his assistant, Max Kolbitsch, both failed to spot what had happened.</p>
      <p>Had Scotland gone behind at that point, it may have been a set-back they couldn’t have recovered from given the confidence-sapped fragility of this squad.</p>
      <p>But the let-off proved to be a wake-up call with Clarke’s men storming into the lead with only 11 minutes on the scoreboard clock.</p>
      <p>Christie - playing off the right - burst inside after good work by McGinn to create an opening. He then smashed high into the net.</p>
      <p>Going ahead settled Scotland immediately.</p>
      <p>Cyprus lived dangerously at the back time and again and there looked a real possibility there would be more goals in the game.</p>

      <p>Liam Palmer had a crack from distance which didn’t miss by much, McKenna also powering a downward header from a corner which had to be cleared.</p>
      <p>Clarke would definitely have been optimistic about things going into the second half.</p>
      <p>But just two minutes after the restart Cyprus scored from a free-kick given away by McKenna.</p>
      <p>The Aberdeen centre back initially did well to read the play and step in to make an interception. But his touch saw the ball get away from him and he then stretched into a challenge he was never going to win.</p>

      <p>The ref booked him for his trouble.</p>
      <p>From the dead-ball situation Cyprus crossed into the box with Declan Gallagher heading clear, but the ball only went as far as Efrem who sent a stunning volley past David Marshall.</p>
      <p>It was a poor goal to give away, first the free-kick conceded needless and the defending at the set-piece nowhere near good enough. Albeit, the strike itself was something special.</p>
      <p>Scotland suddenly had to regroup and go again - and they did just that to take the lead again within just five minutes.</p>

      <p>Greg Taylor combined with James Forrest down the left with the Celtic defender whipping in a cross which looked like it was aimed for Naismith.</p>
      <p>But he stepped over it with McGinn latching onto it, with the Aston Villa star cushioning the ball into the bottom corner of the net.</p>
      <p>It was another excellent move from Scotland finished off brilliantly.</p>

      <p>Taylor was then involved in an altercation with Cyprus midfielder Jason Demetriou which resulted in both players being booked.</p>
      <p>But Taylor’s only crime was kicking the ball away - while Demetriou booted him with a kick which could easily have seen him shown a straight red card.</p>
      <p>Scotland were then dealt a blow on the hour mark with Naismith falling and twisting awkwardly as he tried to turn for a pass on the halfway line.</p>
      <p>At first it didn’t look good at all for a player with a history of knee problems. After gingerly getting back up onto his feet Clarke shouted from the sidelines for him to sit back down again as he quickly made a change.</p>
      <p>But while his pride came before a fall here Scotland’s didn’t.</p>
