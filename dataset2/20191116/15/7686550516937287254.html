      <p>Students are being urged to get in touch with their loved ones following a devastating fire in an apartment block in Greater Manchester.</p>
      <p>The blaze destroyed the student accommodation in Bolton and Mayor Andy Burnham said "not everyone" is accounted for.</p>
      <p>In a Tweet, Mr Burnham said: "Most people have been accounted for but not everyone and investigations are ongoing."</p>
      <p>Fire crews were called to six-storey building The Cube on Bradshawgate, close to the town centre, at 8.30pm on Friday, November 15.</p>
      <p>Residents are being asked to go to Orlando Village student accommodation and contact their loved ones to let them know they are safe.</p>

      <p>Mr Burnham said in a Tweet: "Last night, Manchester Fire implemented one of their own learnings from Grenfell by sending a second command team to deal explicitly with the evacuation."</p>
      <p>Residents had already started to evacuate the building as firefighters arrived.</p>
      <p>In total two people were treated by paramedics at the scene, including one person who was rescued by crews using an aerial platform.</p>
      <p>At its height, around 200 firefighters were tackling the blaze, with 40 fire engines, three aerial platforms and other specialist appliances in use.</p>

      <p>Assistant Chief Fire Officer Tony Hunter said: “Our crews have done a fantastic job bringing this fire under control, in what have been very challenging circumstances.</p>
      <p>"I want to praise their swift action, which has prevented the fire from spreading to adjacent buildings."</p>
      <p>He added: “I’m pleased the say that we are now scaling back our response and we will remain at the scene for the next few hours as we tackle the remaining pockets of fire.</p>
      <p>“Our priority now is ensuring that all residents of The Cube register at Orlando Village on Thynne Street, Bolton so we know they are safe and well.”</p>

      <p>The University of Bolton is supporting students who have been evacuated. They are urged to go to Orlando Village student accommodation on Thynne Street.</p>
      <p>Professor George E Holmes DL, President and Vice Chancellor of the University of Bolton, said: “Supporting the welfare of our students is our number one priority and we have moved swiftly to assist in any way we can.</p>
      <p>“University colleagues have worked through the night to make sure support is in place for students over the weekend.</p>
      <p>“We have assisted in ensuring students have been given temporary alternative accommodation at the Orlando student halls and in some Bolton hotels.</p>

      <p>“We have also arranged to provide necessities such as toiletries for all students affected and are opening the University over the weekend so students can be supported. We will also provide food for them.</p>
      <p>“I would like to stress that The Cube is not owned by the University of Bolton. It is owned and managed by a private landlord and the students were not on our premises when during this incident.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/swansea-university">Swansea University</a> Students' Union wrote on Facebook: "Our thoughts go out to those affected by the fire in The Cube accomodaton last night at the University of Bolton.</p>
      <p>"We're aware that over 200 students have been affected, with their belongings being lost in the fire and having to be allocated temporary accommodation."</p>
      <p>They are asking students in Swansea to donate anything they can, including clothes and toiletries, to support the students in Bolton.</p>
