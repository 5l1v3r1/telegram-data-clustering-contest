      <p>With Flavien Prat up, <b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/Extra_Hope">Extra Hope</a></b> worked five furlongs in 1:02.80 Saturday morning for Hall of Fame trainer Richard Mandella in preparation for the Grade 3, $100,000 Native Diver Stakes next Saturday at 1 1/8 miles on the main track.</p>
      <p>A 3-year-old son of Shanghai Bobby owned by Samantha Siegel’s Jay Em Ess Stable, Extra Hope was third in the seven-furlong Damascus Stakes on Nov. 2 at Santa Anita in his last start.</p>
      <p>“He worked (in company) with a young horse and went really nice,” Mandella said. “He had a nice prep race in the Damascus and we’re anxious to see how he does going longer.”</p>
      <p>Extra Hope is Grade 1-placed in last year's Los Alamitos Futurity, and he returned this season to emerge as a Kentucky Derby prospect when winning a Jan. 31 allowance race at Santa Anita. Fourth in a division of Oaklawn Park's Rebel Stakes (G2), Extra Hope was then freshened up for a fall campaign.</p>
      <p>Mandella’s promising 2-year-old, Goliad, came out of a runner-up showing in Thursday’s second race in good shape and is being aimed for the Grade 3, $100,000 Cecil B. DeMille on Dec. 1, closing day at Del Mar.<br/>“He showed some immaturity (Thursday) but he’ll be all right. He’ll learn from it,” Mandella said.</p>
      <p>
        <b>DECISION TO CANCEL THURSDAY CARD TOUGH BUT NECESSARY</b>
      </p>
      <p>Cancellation of a racing day due to weather hadn’t happened at Del Mar in the track’s 82-year history. But track officials, eyeing a forecast for heavy rain in the San Diego area in the middle of next week, made the decision on Friday to call off the program for next Thursday.</p>
      <p>“We met, as a group, as we always do, and given the forecast, and the fact that most horses ship in for this meet, felt it was best to get out in front of it,” Racing Secretary David Jerkens said Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>“We know this is unusual for Del Mar,” Del Mar Thoroughbred Club executive vice president for racing Tom Robbins said in making the announcement. “But equine and rider safety is always our primary concern.”</p>
      <p>An additional consideration was preservation of the Jimmy Durante turf course, which will be the venue for seven graded stakes from November 28-December 1, a “turf festival” as the meeting draws to a close.</p>
      <p>In the condition book for Thursday, from which races would have been drawn Saturday if not for the cancellation, four were scheduled on the grass.</p>
      <p>Jerkens said a double draw of entries for races next Friday and Saturday would be held Sunday morning and that efforts would be made to add races, to make up for lost ones, as the meet continues.</p>
      <p>The only previous cancellation of Del Mar racing came in August of 1985 due to a lack of entries after an INS raid of undocumented workers on the backstretch.</p>
      <p>
        <b>DEAD HEATS FOR LEAD IN BOTH JOCKEY, TRAINER RACES</b>
      </p>
      <p>Two wins Friday by Abel Cedillo moved the 30-year-old native of Guatemala into a tie for the lead in the jockey standings with Drayden Van Dyke at six wins each.</p>
      <p>Cedillo, who had been riding at Golden Gate Fields in San Francisco, came south at the start of the Del Mar summer meeting at the behest of agent Tom Knust. He shared the title in the recently completed Santa Anita fall meeting with Flavien Prat.</p>
      <p>“I’d say he has exceeded my expectations,” Knust said. “I knew he could ride, but I didn’t know his work ethic and dedication. I’ve had a lot of talented riders, but none with the work ethic he has. I think he can contend, and possibly win (the riding title). Business is good, I’m getting a lot of calls for him to ride.”</p>
      <p>Trainers Vladimir Cerin and Richard Baltas both saddled two winners on Friday to move into a tie for the lead with Peter Miller. Baltas and Miller have six wins from 14 starters while Cerin has gone 4-for-5.</p>
