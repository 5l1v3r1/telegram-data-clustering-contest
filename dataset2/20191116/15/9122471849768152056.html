      <h1>Odds Released For Which NFL Team Could Sign Colin Kaepernick</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T15:20:05+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 15:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matt-admin" target="_blank">Matt Lombardi</a></address>
      <p>Colin Kaepernick, who has been out of the NFL for three years, has a workout in front of at least 25 teams on Saturday. There are now odds out regarding which teams could sign him in the aftermath.</p>
      <p>BetOnline has odds for 17 different teams that could sign Kaepernick. The Cincinnati Bengals, the only winless team in the NFL, have the best odds at +350.</p>
      <p>The Pittsburgh Steelers, who are currently starting backup Mason Rudolph because of an injury to Ben Roethlisberger, have the next-best odds at +400.</p>
      <p>The Baltimore Ravens check in with the third-best odds at +600. Via OddsShark:</p>

      <p>Kaepernick’s workout is slated to start at 3:00 PM ET at the indoor facility for the Atlanta Falcons. It should last about two hours.</p>
      <p>The NFL is not allowing media at the event, so we’re going to have to wait to hear how Kaepernick performed from team scouts.</p>
      <p>It’s hard to know if any team will be willing to take a shot on Kaepernick – even if he looks good during the workouts. We’ll know more in a few days.</p>
