      <p>On Saturday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “AM Joy,” Representative Ted Lieu (D-CA) stated that House Democrats “want to look at all these instances of witness intimidation,” and will decide whether to make witness intimidation an article of impeachment.</p>
      <p>Lieu said, “What Donald Trump did looks like witness intimidation, and it’s not a one-off thing that Trump did. He’s done this before. He actually threatened Michael Cohen about his father-in-law, and we have other instances where Donald Trump is trying to intimidate witnesses. We do know that even Fox News hosts were shocked. … So, the Democratic caucus, we want to look at all these instances of witness intimidation, as well as obstruction, and we’ll make a decision as to whether we launch an article of impeachment on that issue.”</p>
