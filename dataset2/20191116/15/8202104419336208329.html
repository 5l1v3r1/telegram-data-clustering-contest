      <h3>Silverstone Developments is a smaller company — only building two or three houses a year — which means each build gets personal attention from the owner, Bill Kellins. Incorporated in 2007, the company also does big renovation projects, such as full kitchen or whole-house renos.</h3>
      <p>Their show home at 722 Bolstad Turn is a stylish family-friendly home with all the extras buyers are looking for.</p>
      <p>“We’ve built this floor plan a couple of times,” says Kellins. “We’ve had good success with it.”</p>
      <p>In fact, the 1906-square-foot family-friendly floor plan was so well-received, Kellins built the same home next door, just slightly larger.</p>
      <p>The popular butler’s pantry gets a lot of positive feedback, according to Kellins. The convenient space between the mud room and the kitchen provides easy access when bringing groceries in from the garage. The cabinetry, butcher block counter, built-in dishwasher, and shelving provide tons of storage. Homeowners will also get the convenience of having their morning coffee station out of sight and the dishwasher noise can be muffled behind a pocket door. It’s details like this that make the home feel like a custom build.</p>
      <p>The oversized mud room is sure to appeal to families with small kids. There are hooks for coats and lockers for storing boots and mittens. It’s also centrally located connecting the front door and the garage entrance.</p>
      <p>In the main living area, a gas fireplace with grey tile surround provides a warm, gathering point for the open concept main living area.</p>
      <p>The kitchen is right on trend with white cabinetry, grey quartz countertops, stainless steel appliances, engineered hardwood, and a textured tile backsplash. An island will make for quick prep work, while a stainless steel range hood adds a touch of sophistication.</p>
      <p>At the top of the stairs is what Kellins calls “a flex room”.</p>
      <p>“We call it a flex room because if you have small kids you could make it a playroom. It could be a computer room if you have teenagers. It could be a workout room if you’re empty nesters. It lends itself to a variety of different uses, so that’s why we try to keep it open,” explains Kellins.</p>
      <p>The extra bedrooms upstairs are large and spacious. The homeowner’s suite features a large walk-in closet and ensuite bathroom. Entrances to both are framed by stylish barn doors. The ensuite includes a large walk-in custom-tiled shower. Heated tile floors will keep your feet warm even on the coldest days.</p>
      <p>Located in the new neighbourhood of Aspen Ridge, the show home is listed at $549,900. Aspen Ridge residents will enjoy access to green spaces, trails, and proximity to the Chief Mistawasis Bridge. The bridge makes a quick five-minute commute to the north industrial area of the city.</p>
      <p>Add in a two-car garage, stone accented exterior, and a cover deck, and it’s easy to see how this floor plan remains so popular for Silverstone.</p>
      <p>This show home at 722 Bolstad Turn is open for viewing every Sunday from 2:30 to 4:30 p.m. To book a personal viewing, call real estate agent Sean Wilson at 306-242-6000.</p>
