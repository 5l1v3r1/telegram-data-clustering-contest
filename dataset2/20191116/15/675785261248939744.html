      <p>Jeremy Kyle and his pregnant fiancee Vicky Burton were spotted enjoying some couple time this weekend as she gears up to give birth to their first child together.</p>
      <p>Jeremy, whose ITV programme The Jeremy Kyle Show was axed earlier this year after the death of guest Steve Dymond, was seen carrying a bag of groceries as the two went for a stroll around Windsor.</p>
      <p>Vicky's baby bump was on full display as she walked down the street several steps behind 54-year-old Jeremy, who - ever the gentleman - was touting a Waitrose shopping bag along with a bouquet of fresh flowers.</p>
      <p>The former show host, who is expected to return to screen in 2020, wore a black padded jacket and grey jeans and black shoes to keep out the chill.</p>

      <p>His bride-to-be went for a casual look in black comfy leggings, grey ankle books and a black and white striped top with a white woolly hat in the cold temperature.</p>
      <p>The couple tend not to be pictured together, but are no doubt getting their love nest ready for the birth of their baby in a few weeks' time.</p>
      <p>The happy couple announced they were expecting their first child together back in August.</p>
      <p>"Vick and I couldn’t be happier to say we’re expecting our first baby together," he said at the time.</p>
      <p>"We've told our families and everyone is delighted."</p>

      <p>Jeremy is already dad to daughters Harriet, 29, Alice, 15, Ava, 13, and son Henry, 10, from his previous marriages to Kirsty Rowley and Carla Germaine.</p>
      <p>Vicky used to be the nanny to Jez's younger offspring, but it's believed the couple didn't get together until she had stopped working for the family in April 2016.</p>
      <p>Jeremy went his separate ways from ex-wife Carla after 13 years of marriage, in September 2015, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/jeremy-kyle-officially-divorces-wife-7349743">officially getting divorced five months later</a> .</p>
      <p>Carla, who met Jeremy while he was a radio DJ, cited her husband's "unreasonable behaviour" in their quickie divorce in 2016.</p>

      <p>The 54-year-old grandfather raised eyebrows when he proposed to his kids' nanny in February 2018 after a year of dating, but they had already known each other for a decade.</p>
      <p>When news of Jeremy and Vicky’s <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/isle-do-jeremy-kyle-marry-12002064">relationship first broke</a> , Carla said: "I'm in shock. She was my nanny for nine years. She looked after my babies. We were best friends. But I haven't heard anything from her."</p>
      <p>Jeremy and Vicky are believed to be planning their nuptials for the summer of 2020 in the Caribbean, where they holidayed together with his kids and Carla.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, his return to TV was announced in August by the Mirror.</p>

      <p>Head of ITV Ken Lygo confirmed ITV was "piloting" Kyle's new project and that his investigative series The Kyle Files would return in 2020.</p>
      <p>"We have an ongoing commitment to The Kyle Files which is his style of journo thing which will be ready next year sometime.</p>
      <p>"We are piloting something with him and we will just have to have a look because he is a consummate broadcaster and it would be absolutely wrong to apportion blame of the show against the presenter of it.</p>
      <p>"We don't hold him in any bad way. We will look to find another show with him but I think it is unlikely it will go in the same slot."</p>
