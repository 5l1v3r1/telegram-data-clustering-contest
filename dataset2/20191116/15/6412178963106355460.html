        <b>Cardiff have announced the appointment of former Millwall boss Neil Harris as their new manager.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 42-year-old has signed a deal until summer 2022 to succeed Neil Warnock, whose three-year spell in charge came to an end last week.</p>
      <p>Harris, who resigned as Millwall manager last month, will take charge of his first game on November 23 when Cardiff travel to Charlton.</p>
      <p>Harris takes over with Cardiff in 14th place in the Championship following their Premier League relegation last season.</p>
      <p>Owner Vincent Tan said: “I am pleased to appoint Neil as first-team manager of the club.</p>
      <p>“I have full confidence in Neil due to his principles on and off the pitch and enthusiasm to succeed. I am glad to offer him this opportunity and look forward to seeing what he is capable of achieving with Cardiff City.”</p>

      <p>Former striker Harris, who spent a brief loan spell at Cardiff as a player in 2004, managed Millwall for four years, winning promotion to the Championship in 2017.</p>
      <p>Chairman Mehmet Dalman said: “Neil is a passionate manager who has all of the right attributes to take the helm at Cardiff City.</p>
      <p>“I know he’s eager to get to work and we look forward to seeing him strive to get the best out of our tight-knit and talented group of players.”</p>
      <p>David Livermore has been named as Harris’ assistant, with James Rowberry and Andy Dibble continuing as first-team coach and goalkeeping coach respectively.</p>
      <p>Kevin Blackwell and Ronnie Jepson have left the club.</p>
