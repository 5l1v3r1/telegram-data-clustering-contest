      <h1>Glasgow edge out Faf-less Sale Sharks</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T15:22:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 15:22</time> by <a rel="author">By Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>DTH Van Der Merwe’s try gave <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/glasgow">Glasgow</a> a winning start to their Champions Cup campaign as they edged out <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/sale">Sale</a> 13-7.</p>
      <p>Dave Rennie’s <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/wp/sale-sharks-vs-glasgow-warriors/">team dominated the first half but should have taken more than a solitary try and eight points from the boot of Adam Hastings.</a></p>
      <p>With South Africa’s World Cup winning scrum-half Faf De Klerk still to return to action, Sale badly lacked tempo during the opening 40 minutes.</p>
      <p>Steve Diamond rang the changes early after the interval and got a response as <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/mitre-10-cup/teams/wellington/players/coenie-oosthuizen/">Coenie Oosthuizen</a> crossed over.</p>
      <p>Warriors failed to build on their tally but were relieved as they held on for victory.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>As well as De Klerk, Sharks were also missing fellow Springbok Lood De Jager as well as England’s beaten finalists <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/sale/players/tom-curry/">Tom Curry</a> and Mark Wilson.</p>
      <p>The hosts on other hand were almost at full strength, with <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/scotland">Scotland</a> lock <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/scotland/players/jonny-gray/">Jonny Gray</a> the only one of the 19 men they sent to <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/japan">Japan</a> yet to return to club duty and it showed as the Warriors bossed the early exchanges.</p>
      <p>With <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/sharks">Sharks</a> at least doing well to shut down attacking channels, Hastings went for an ambitious drop goal attempt but the ball sliced off his foot and drifted wide.</p>
      <p>His next effort off the tee did fly over as he nudged Warriors ahead on the quarter-hour mark.</p>
      <p>But it was a shaky kicking display from the Scotland fly-half as he again skewed past the poles with another penalty after <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/sale/players/jake-cooper-woolley/">Jake Cooper-Woolley</a> was penalised for handling in the maul.</p>
      <p>Glasgow were well on top but a three-point advantage was little reward for their efforts, so Hastings made certain to split the posts when he was handed another chance after an illegal <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/sale/players/byron-mcguigan/">Byron McGuigan</a> tackle on 27 minutes.</p>
      <p>The thermometer was sitting just a couple of degrees above zero but Sale looked frozen stiff with the ball in hand.</p>
      <p>And they were little better as Glasgow broke through for the opening try four minutes before the break.</p>
      <p>Fraser Brown’s line-out was plucked by <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/scotland/players/ryan-wilson/">Ryan Wilson</a> before <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/scotland/players/sam-johnson/">Sam Johnson</a> turned up the speed levels as he flicked a <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/scotland/players/george-horne/">George Horne</a> pass round the corner for Van Der Merwe and there was no catching the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/canada">Canada</a> international as he darted for the corner.</p>
      <p>Sale were hoping the change of ends would produce a change in fortunes.</p>
      <p>They got a stroke of luck when a cruel bounce denied Van Der Merwe a second try as he chased after a clever Hastings kick to the corner.</p>
      <p>And they finally built up the momentum that got them on the scoreboard on 63 minutes.</p>
      <p>Diamond waited just a couple of minutes after half-time before replacing his front-row and it was substitute prop Oosthuizen who squeezed over the line for the score that drew <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/currie-cup/teams/sharks">Sharks</a> back within six points of Rennie’s team.</p>
      <p>The Sale replacements had made a huge difference, giving them the upper hand at the set-piece and Glasgow’s nerves appeared to be jangling as the game moved into the final 10 minutes.</p>
