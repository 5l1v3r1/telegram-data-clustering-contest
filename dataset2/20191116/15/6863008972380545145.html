      <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's aide Andriy Yermak and U.S. lobbyist Bryan Lanza, who is close to U.S. President Donald Trump, may form a new communication channel between the White House and the Office of the President of Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Their meeting was reported on Twitter by Michael Weiss, a New York Times journalist, <a href="https://censor.net.ua/ua/news/3160023/yermak_i_lanza_mojut_staty_novym_kanalom_komunikatsiyi_mij_bilym_domom_i_ofisom_prezydenta_ukrayiny">Censor.net</a> reports.</p>
      <p>"Brian Lanza, a former Trump campaign official turned lobbyist, was meeting with Zelensky's aide (and former Rudy [Giuliani] contact) Andriy Yermak at Goodman steak house in Kyiv," the journalist wrote.</p>
      <p>Weiss also suggested that this could be a new "back-channel" between the White House and the Office of the President of Ukraine.</p>
      <p>"Traveling to Ukraine 'on business' is a very convenient cover story, after all," said Weiss.</p>
      <p>He also noted that an unknown source recorded and posted on Youtube a video of the meeting, which, apparently, was also attended by Yernak's PR consultant Daria Zarivna.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.pravda.com.ua/rus/news/2019/11/14/7231975/">Ukrainian Pravda</a> also reported on the meeting of Andriy Yermak and Bryan Lanza: it is reported that the meeting took place on the evening of November 13 at the Goodman restaurant in Kiev on Zhilyanska Street.</p>
      <p>At first, Lanza spent time in the company of Yermakâ€™s assistant, and at about 22:00, Zelensky's aide joined in.</p>
      <p>The reason for the meeting between Yermak and lobbyist Bryan Lanza, who is close to Donald Trump, is unclear.</p>
      <p>Previously, CNN reported that Brian Lanza was one of the lobbyists who worked toward the lifting of sanctions off companies of the Russian oligarch close to the Kremlin, Oleg Deripaska.</p>
      <p>Prior to that, Lanza was an advisor to Donald Trump during his presidential election campaign.</p>
      <p>According to U.S. media, the lobbyist is still in constant contact with White House officials.</p>
