      <h4>New image revealed</h4>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> have <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-reveal-amazing-new-3540790">revealed a new image of the proposed City Ground redevelopments</a> as the club's plans progress - and there has been insight into how long the project is hoped to take.</p>
      <p>The plans - which were initially unveiled earlier this year - are set to see the Peter Taylor Stand rebuilt to cater for an increased capacity of about 10,000 supporters.</p>
      <p>It is anticipated planning application for the project will be submitted before the end of this year, and should permission be granted, it is hoped work could get underway during the first half of 2020.</p>
      <p>According to lead architect and CEO of Benoy Tom Cartledge, plenty of work has been going on behind the scenes since the initial announcement in March.</p>

      <p>It is hoped the project to transform Nottingham Forest’s City Ground into a world-class venue will take 15 months from start date to completion.</p>
      <p>Redevelopment plans for the Reds’ home were announced earlier this year and will see the Peter Taylor Stand rebuilt to cater for an increased capacity of about 10,000 fans, as well as improvements made to the other three sides of the ground - with the Bridgford Stand also extended.</p>
      <p>It is anticipated the planning application will be submitted before the end of the year, following a public exhibition at the City Ground yesterday and today.</p>

      <p>If permission is granted, it is hoped work could get underway during the first half of 2020.</p>
      <p>And while it will take more than a year to complete fully, Benoy - the architectural firm behind the multi-million pound project - hope as many as 5,000 seats could be available in the new Peter Taylor Stand a few months into the work starting.</p>
