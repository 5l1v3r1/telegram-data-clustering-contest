      <h1>ESPN’s Lee Corso Isn’t Changing His Prediction For Alabama</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T15:42:45+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 15:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>On Saturday morning, ESPN’s College GameDay kicked off from Waco, Texas ahead of a huge came with College Football Playoff implications.</p>
      <p>No. 13 Baylor hosts No. 10 Oklahoma in a battle of Big 12 programs looking for a conference title. Before the day’s action kicks off, the GameDay crew broke down which teams can make the playoff.</p>
      <p>Lee Corso argued that, despite losing to LSU, Alabama will still make the playoff. He suggested a one-loss Pac-12 champion will still be behind Alabama in the final College Football Playoff rankings.</p>
      <p>“A one-loss Alabama is still in the playoff. That’s my story and I’m sticking to it,” Corso said.</p>

      <p>Kirk Herbstreit disagreed.</p>
      <p>He suggested a one-loss Pac-12 champion will definitely get into the playoff over a non-SEC champion Alabama team. If the Crimson Tide miss the playoff this season, it will be the first time Nick Saban’s squad hasn’t played in the playoff.</p>
      <p>Herbie also suggest a one-loss Oklahoma program will make the playoff over Alabama if the Sooners win the Big 12.</p>
      <p>Playoff talk is fun, but we won’t truly know anything until the regular season wraps up. Undefeated conference champions will be in, anything other than that is just speculation at this point.</p>
      <p>Stay tuned for the latest.</p>
