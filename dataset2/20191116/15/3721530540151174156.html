      <h1>Simpsons World vanishes, taking every episode to Disney Plus</h1>

      <p>And just like that, Simpsons World is no more.</p>
      <p>FX Networks said this would happen once <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/11/20959171/disney-plus-shows-movies-subscription-pricing-news-devices-and-more">Disney Plus launched</a>, and that happened on Tuesday, making full episodes of <i>The Simpsons</i>’ 31-season run available there. That mooted Simpsons World, which launched in 2014 and was available through a mobile app and a variety of streaming services.</p>
      <p>So what’s the big deal? Well, obviously Disney Plus is a premium service ($6.99 a month/$69.99 a year), whereas full episodes on Simpsons World was accessed with a valid cable TV subscription and login. (Clips and classic moments were available to anyone.)</p>
      <p>Moreover, as we’ve pointed out, the episodes are <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/12/20962035/disney-plus-simpsons-episodes-aspect-ratio-crop">shown in a 16:9 aspect ratio only</a>, with options for viewing them in their original 4:3 perspective (1989 to 2009) coming later. Also, <i>The Simpsons </i>on Disney Plus doesn’t have any bonus features, such as audio commentary from the Fox-published DVD sets.</p>
      <p>This is all part of Disney’s acquisition of 20th Century Fox and Fox Television (but <i>not</i> Fox News Channel), a $71.3 billion deal that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/12/14/16778224/disney-fox-deal-movies-tv-rights">took effect March 20</a>. Disney Plus, which includes original live-action series like <i>The Mandalorian</i>, launched on Tuesday with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/11/20956257/disney-plus-tv-shows-movies-full-list-star-wars-marvel-pixar-dcom">a massive back catalog of Disney and Fox’s most popular franchises</a>, both TV and film. It’s Disney’s skin in the over-the-top streaming service game, so of course it’ll be the exclusive home for <i>The Simpsons </i>as much as it is for Star Wars, Pixar and Marvel.</p>
      <p><b>Correction: </b>A previous version of this story (and its headline) incorrectly said all episodes of <i>The Simpsons’ </i>31 seasons are now on Disney Plus. That’s actually not true. 1991’s “Stark Raving Dad,” which guest-starred Michael Jackson, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/2019/3/8/18256129/the-simpsons-michael-jackson-episode-pulled-stark-raving-dad">isn’t on the service</a>. Disney pulled the show from syndication and streaming services before the launch of Disney Plus. It’s the only one of the 662 that isn’t available.</p>
