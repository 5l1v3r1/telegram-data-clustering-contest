      <h1>Key Aston Villa defender walking disciplinary tightrope as Manchester United and Chelsea clashes loom</h1>
      <h2>Latest Aston Villa news | Dean Smith's side currently face an injury crisis with their Premier League campaign set to continue after the international break</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T15:30:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 15:30</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Husband, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/ben-husband/, Mark Wakefield</a></address>
      <p>When <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> return to action after the current international break, Dean Smith faces a number of selection dilemmas.</p>
      <p>The Lions went into the break on the back of a 2-1 defeat to local rivals Wolverhampton Wanderers last week.</p>
      <p>That loss was Villa's seventh in the Premier League since their return to the top flight, and they are now one place above the relegation zone.</p>
      <p>And to make matters worse, Villa are in the middle of an injury crisis.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>As well as losing their most recent game against Wolves, they were dealt the cruelest of hands on the injury front.</p>
      <p>Jack Grealish, Bjorn Engels and Tom Heaton all missed the game completely, whilst second choice keeper Jed Steer and Matt Targett limped out of the action at Molineux.</p>
      <p>All those now face a race to be fit for their Villa Park clash with Newcastle United, but on the horizon are a series of daunting looking fixture for the Villans.</p>

      <p>Following the game against the Magpies, Villa face Manchester United, Chelsea, Leicester and surprise package Sheffield United.</p>
      <p>And one man that faces missing one of those games is Frederic Guilbert. The Frenchman has been in fine form since coming into the side after his January move.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>But he picked up his fourth booking of the season in the defeat to Wolves, meaning he is now walking a disciplinary tightrope. Bans for accumulation of yellow cards last up until 19 fixtures into the season, meaning in all likelihood, Smith will have to cope without his first choice right back in at least one fixture.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old has a reputation for getting on the wrong side of referees and has been booked a staggering <b>25 times</b> since the start of the 2017/18 season.</p>
