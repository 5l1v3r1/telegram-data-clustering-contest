      <p>Continuing their winning momentum in the longest format of the game, India kicked off their two-match Test series against Bangladesh with an emphatic victory. Dominating the visitors in both the departments of the game, the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/virat-kohli/">Virat Kohli</a>-led unit crushed their opponent by an innings and 130 runs to wrap the contest in just three days. With this win, India have now taken a 1-0 lead in the two-match series.</p>
      <p>After piling a gigantic 493/6 in response to Bangladesh’s 150 on Day 2, skipper Virat Kohli declared the innings and invited Bangladesh openers Shadman Islam and Imrul Kayes to kick-off the proceedings on the third day. Starting the day 343 runs behind the hosts, Bangladesh got off to a dreadful start, losing both the openers early in the first hour.</p>

      <p><a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/umesh-yadav/">Umesh Yadav</a> provided India with the first breakthrough as he cleaned up Kayes on six and <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/ishant-sharma/">Ishant Sharma</a> followed it up by dismissing his partner Islam in a similar fashion. The Indian seamers continued their dominance in the first session as Bangladesh were reduced to 60/4 at Lunch.</p>
      <p>In the second session of the day, the visitors showed some fightback as Liton Das along with Mushfiqur Rahim added 63 runs for the fifth wicket before the former was caught and bowled by R Ashwin on 35. However, experienced Rahim continued with his cautious approach and went on to construct another crucial partnership with Mehidy Hasan.</p>

      <p>However, Umesh struck in the first over after Tea as Hasan was beaten by his pace. The batsman returned to the pavilion after scoring a fighting 38.</p>
      <p>Wickets kept tumbling after Hasan’s departure while Rahim continued to resist the Indian attack. The 32-year-old was finally removed by Ashwin on 64 and in the next over bowled by the leg-spinner he removed Ebadat Hossain to bundle out the visitors on 213.</p>
      <p>The victory gave India 60 points, and strengthened their position in the World Test Championship table with 300 points in their kitty. The thrashing also completed a hat-trick of innings wins for them, having beaten South Africa in the second and third Test in the previous series.</p>
