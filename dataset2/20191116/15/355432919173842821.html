      <p>According to Swift's tweet, Braun and Borchetta, who own the rights to Swift's older songs, are prohibiting the 29-year-old from performing those songs live. </p>
      <p>The freshman congresswoman took to Twitter to show her support for Swift.</p>
      <p>"Private equity groups' predatory practices actively hurt millions of Americans," Ocasio-Cortez tweeted on Friday.</p>
      <p>"Their leveraged buyouts have destroyed the lives of retail workers across the country, scrapping 1+ million jobs. Now they’re holding @taylorswift13’s own music hostage. They need to be reigned in."</p>
