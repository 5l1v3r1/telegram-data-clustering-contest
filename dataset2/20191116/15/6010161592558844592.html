      <h1>Next Mass Effect game in “very early development” – report</h1>

      <p>Looks like BioWare is working on the next Mass Effect game, according to a report.</p>
      <p>BioWare working on a new <b>Mass Effect</b> game shouldn’t come as a surprise, but still, that’s a nice assurance for fans.</p>
      <p>News of the next game in the franchise came on the tail end of <a href="https://kotaku.com/sources-bioware-plans-a-complete-overhaul-for-anthem-1839892415">a Kotaku report</a> yesterday, which stated <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/11/15/anthem-getting-complete-overhaul-bioware-rumor/">Anthem was getting a complete overhaul</a>.</p>
      <p>According to the report, the new game in the space-RPG series is in “very early development,” at the Edmonton office under the direction of BioWare producer Mike Gamble.</p>
      <p>General manager Casey Hudson recently <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/11/08/mass-effect-concept-art-shows-ideas-havent-yet-brought-life/">shared some Mass Effect concept art on N7 Day</a>. In his tweet, he stated the artwork showed ideas that haven’t “yet been brought to life,” so maybe we’ll see some of it in the next title.</p>
      <p>On the <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2018/11/08/mass-effect-andromeda-xbox-one-x-patch-n7-day/">previous N7 Day in 2018</a>, Gamble said the team still has stories left to tell in the universe, and that “the future is bright.”</p>
      <p>BioWare is also working on the next Dragon Age title, <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/10/30/dragon-age-4-may-release-in-2022-or-2023/">but it’s quite a ways off</a>.</p>
