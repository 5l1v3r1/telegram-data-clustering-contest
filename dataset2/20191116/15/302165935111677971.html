      <p>NOVEMBER 16 — Championship club Cardiff City appointed Neil Harris as manager in succession to Neil Warnock today as the second-tier side look to reinvigorate their bid to return to the Premier League.</p>
      <p>“I am pleased to appoint Neil as first team,” said Cardiff’s Malaysian owner Vincent Tan.</p>
      <p>“I have full confidence in Neil due to his principles on and off the pitch and enthusiasm to succeed. I am glad to offer him this opportunity and look forward to seeing what he is capable of achieving with Cardiff City.”</p>
      <p>The 42-year-old former Millwall manager has signed a three-year deal.</p>
      <p>Warnock resigned last week after the Welsh club’s poor start to the season following their relegation from the top flight. Cardiff are currently 14th in English football’s second-tier league.</p>
