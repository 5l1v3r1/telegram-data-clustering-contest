      <p><b>News</b> by Wesley Yin-Poole, Deputy Editor Updated on 16 November 2019</p>
      <p>Games Workshop has announced Warhammer The Old World, an upcoming return to the Fantasy Battle-era of the tabletop game.</p>
      <p>We only occasionally dabble in tabletop gaming news here on Eurogamer (if you're after an expert view of the scene - and a lot of fun to boot - check out our friends over at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0jMXccxfvnwXvTpngFwbNA">Dicebreaker</a>). But I can't help but view this piece of news through a video game lens.</p>
      <p>For the uninitiated, back in 2015, Games Workshop destroyed Warhammer's much-loved Old World and replaced the Warhammer: The Game of Fantasy Battles tabletop with the Age of Sigmar. This was a resounding success in tabletop land, and Warhammer hasn't looked back since.</p>
      <p>But the world of Warhammer video games has stuck with the Old World - and developers have done some great work with it, too.</p>
      <p>Creative Assembly's wonderful Total War: Warhammer is a case in point. The sweeping strategy game is set in the Old World, and as such stars mythic heroes and armies from that era. Fatshark's first-person co-op game Warhammer: Vermintide is another Old World video game. Both these games were hugely successful, and have spawned sequels. Total War: Warhammer (I still think it should be called Total Warhammer!) is in fact getting a third game.</p>

      <p>While <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/2019/11/15/old-world-new-warhammer/">Games Workshop's announcement blog post</a> doesn't credit these games with rekindling the passion for Warhammer's Old World, anecdotally I know they've provided fans with an Old World fix as Age of Sigmar takes over the tabletop world. And to be fair, Games Workshop points to Total War: Warhammer and Vermintide in its announcement of Warhammer The Old World:</p>
      <p>"If you're itching to jump into the Old World right now, you can!" it says. "There is a fantastic selection of computer games, such as Vermintide and Total War: Warhammer, offering a chance to engage in the enduring appeal of the setting."</p>
      <p>Don't hold your breath for Warhammer The Old World, by the way. All there is right now is a logo, and Games Workshop said "this is a long way off. Years. More than two. Like three or more. Definitely not soon".</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, this is very much good news for Old World fans who also love good video games, and hopefully we'll see more quality games set in Warhammer's best era.</p>
