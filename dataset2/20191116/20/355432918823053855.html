      <p>Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, the widow of late Rep. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/elijah-cummings-0">Elijah Cummings</a> (D-Md.), is recovering after a successful double mastectomy Friday at Johns Hopkins Hospital, <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/bs-md-pol-rockeymoore-cummings-mastectomy-20191116-trguizaxqnbljfgfoxdw3uzfsi-story.html">The Baltimore Sun reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Cummings's campaign says she'll be back on the campaign trail soon.</p>
      <p>Cummings is running for her late husband's 7th Congressional District seat but announced this earlier in the week that she would have the preventive surgery due to a family history of breast cancer.</p>
      <p>“We are lucky to have a world-class institution like Johns Hopkins here in Baltimore and we are grateful to Dr. Mehrad Habibi, Dr. Gedge Rosson, and the rest of the wonderful Hopkins team that expertly performed Maya’s surgery,” Tucker Cavanagh, Cummings's campaign manager, said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"Most importantly, we are so glad that Maya is healthy and recovering, and she’s looking forward to getting back on the campaign trail in a few weeks," he added.</p>
