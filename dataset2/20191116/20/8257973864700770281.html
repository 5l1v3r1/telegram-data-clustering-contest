      <p>Nov. 16 (UPI) -- A car bomb in northern Syria killed multiple people and injured several others Saturday, Turkish officials said.</p>
      <p>The attack occurred in the al-Bab district of northern Syria,<a href="https://news.sky.com/story/at-least-12-killed-in-car-bomb-in-syria-near-turkish-border-11862627"> controlled by Turkey-backed</a> opposition fighters.</p>
      <p>"According to hosptial in al-Bab and our count, 15 [were] killed," Hassan Abu Salah, director of volunteer rescue group Syrian Civil Defense, known as the White Helmets, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/16/middleeast/al-bab-car-bomb-syria-intl/index.html">told CNN</a>. "Twelve bodies [have] been identified by name and three other bodies still not identified as a result of being charred and mutated."</p>
      <p>Turkey's National Defense Ministry, cited by <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/at-least-12-killed-in-car-bomb-in-syria-near-turkish-border-11862627">Sky News</a> and Turkish state-run <a href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/bomb-attack-kills-18-in-northern-syria/1647292">Anadolu News Agency</a>, said the death toll increased to 18, though CNN could not confirm that number independently.</p>
      <p>In a tweet Saturday, Turkey's National Defense Ministry <a href="https://twitter.com/tcsavunma/status/1195659923675332608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1195659923675332608&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aa.com.tr%2Fen%2Fmiddle-east%2Fbomb-attack-kills-18-in-northern-syria%2F1647292">blamed Kurdish groups</a> in the region for the attacks.</p>
      <p>"Inhumane and uncivilized PKK/YPG terrorists continue to target innocent civilians using the same methods as DAESH," the tweet said. "This time the terrorists detonated a car bomb in the Al-Bab bus terminal in the Op Euphrates Shield area, killing 10 civilians and injuring more than 15."</p>
      <p>Daesh is a transliteration of the Arabic acronym for the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Islamic-State/?tps=1">Islamic State</a></p>
      <p>"At the location of the explosion, the Syrian Civil Defense workers removed body parts and collected them in bags and were handed to hospitals," Salah said.</p>
