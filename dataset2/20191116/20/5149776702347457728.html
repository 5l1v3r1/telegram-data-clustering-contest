      <p>Supporters have praised Nottingham Forest's 'iconic' £100m stadium redevelopment plans - saying the project will 'bring us in line with some of the best grounds in the country'.</p>
      <p>More than 1,000 fans have been to a public consultation inviting discussion on the project which is expected to bring the City Ground up to a 38,000 capacity, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/nottingham-forest-stadium-redevelopment-see-2584320">making it the biggest stadium in the East Midlands</a>.</p>
      <p>While about 3,500 people have left feedback online and at the open event.</p>
      <p>A fresh image showing how the ground could eventually look was released this week with the Peter Taylor Stand expected to be <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-reveal-amazing-new-3540790">rebuilt catering for about 10,000 fans alone</a>.</p>
      <p>Forest also want to make improvements to the surrounding Trentside area and the three other stands.</p>
      <p>Work on the Bridgford Stand has the potential to add more seats.</p>
      <p>Fans praised the ambition of the club under the helm of Greek shipping magnate owner, Evangelos Marinakis.</p>
      <p>Shaun Dabell, 62, of Bulwell, a store keeper and season ticket holder in lower tier of the Trent End, said: "If the actual stands match the pictures it's going to be very impressive. All the redevelopment down Trentside as well it's going to be very iconic Trent Bridge is.</p>
      <p>"It's very important because we have gone through years under the last owner. He just ruined the club.</p>

      <p>"Marinakis has come in and actually transformed this club. The positivity around the ground is brilliant and the actual city as well."</p>
      <p>His son, Luke, 32, of Bulwell, an electrical engineer and lifelong Reds fan, said: "It's really good to see what they are going to do and bring us in line with some of the best grounds in the country.</p>

      <p>"Since they did this, the Trent End, nothing really happened. Now what they are proposing to do it looks amazing."</p>

      <p>Phil Rushton, 63, of Ilkeston, a steward at the club and supporter, said the proposals would make the City Ground "Premier League quality ready for when we do move up".</p>
      <p>"It's just going to make this area an absolutely fabulous place to visit for both fans like myself and visitors, they're going to come from all over the country. We're going to do this without having to move it (the stadium) to some soulless retail park in the middle of nowhere.</p>
      <p>"This retains our heritage, our history and gives a great start for the new season. I'm really looking forward to it."</p>

      <p>It is <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/redevelopment-nottingham-forests-city-ground-3383686">anticipated a planning application for the project</a> will be submitted before the end of this year, and, should permission be granted, it is hoped work could get underway during the first half of 2020.</p>
      <p>The development will involve around £100m of investment, delivering new state-of-the-art dressing rooms, a museum, club shop, executive boxes and media suites.</p>
      <p>Retired David Pickston, 69, of Newark, a season ticket holder in the upper tier of the Brian Clough Stand, explained he'd been a fan since 1959.</p>
      <p>"Development is exciting," he said. "At the end of the day, it's got to go hand in glove with success on the field.</p>

      <p>"They are not investing all this money to have a team in the Championship indefinitely."</p>
      <p>He said he thought the owner's ambitions weren't just to get promoted and make "up the numbers in the Premier League".</p>
      <p>"He wants Forest to be up there with the big boys again," said Mr Pickston, who used to work in financial services.</p>
      <p>Duncan MacLaren, 72, a solicitor of Southwell, a season ticket holder in the Peter Taylor Stand, added: "If we have got a state-of-the-art ground we need a state-of-the-art team to go with it. We have got the makings at the moment."</p>
      <p>A public exhibition took place at the City Ground on Friday (November 15) and Saturday (November 16).</p>
