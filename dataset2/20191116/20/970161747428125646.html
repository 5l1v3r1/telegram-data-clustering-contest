      <p>A suspected gunman and four others have been arrested after a mass shooting during a New Jersey high school American football game.</p>
      <p>Three people, including a 10-year-old boy who is in a critical condition, were wounded in the attack that authorities said was the result of ‘petty vengeance’.</p>

      <p>Atlantic County Prosecutor Damon Tyner said: ‘Unlike some of the shootings that have occurred on school premises throughout the country, this incident had nothing to do with the students of Pleasantville High School or Camden High School.</p>
      <p>‘The venue simply presented an opportunity for criminals to pursue their own form of petty vengeance against one another.</p>
      <p>‘As a result, an innocent child was caught and injured in their crossfire.</p>
      <p>‘Our community will not be held hostage by a few idiots intent on jeopardising our safety and the safety of our children.’</p>

      <p>The stadium’s stands were packed to watch the Greyhounds who had won its first division title in 43 years.</p>
      <p>Witnesses described the panic as the shootings began with spectators and players trying to flee, some knocking down the perimeter fence to escape.</p>
      <p>Children also became separated from parents during the chaos.</p>
      <p>Jonathan Diego, who was at the game, said: ‘It was mayhem, literally people coming in waves running away.’</p>
      <p>Mr Diego said his friend, a retired paramedic, gave first aid to the 10-year-old.</p>

      <p>‘He applied pressure to the little boy’s wounds on his neck, trying to slow down the bleeding until the ambulance could come up,’ he said.</p>
      <p>Video captured during the attack shows people hitting the ground, running from stands and jumping fences as gunfire rings out.</p>
      <p>At least six shots can be heard as the players stop play and run.</p>

      <p>Democratic Governor Phil Murphy lamented the violence and said: ‘High school playoff football should be a cause for community celebration, not the backdrop for panic and terror.</p>
      <p>‘Last night was a stark reminder that no community is immune from gun violence, and that we must not ever give up in our efforts to prevent such senseless acts.’</p>
