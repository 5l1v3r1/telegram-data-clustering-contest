      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: An investigation is under way at HMS Sultan training base in Portsmouth as the incident is further evidence of a drink problem blighting the Armed Forces</h2>

      <p>Sozzled sailors are in hot water after a drunken rampage that went way over the top.</p>
      <p>Three rookies were filmed passed out in a trashed bedroom at a training base.</p>
      <p>A mattress, table, chair and small fridge has been hurled from the first-floor window, while a bed is up-ended.</p>
      <p>Papers are strewn everywhere and an empty spirits bottle is on a table.</p>
      <p>A second clip – by which time the sailors have vanished – shows shocked senior ratings inspecting the damage as one of them says: “What is that? Jesus.”</p>
      <p>A warrant officer orders a colleague to find the rookies and ensure they are safe.</p>
      <p>There are strict rules on boozing in training establishments.</p>

      <p>The Armed Forces also has a duty of care which includes laying down rules to prevent personnel getting dangerously drunk.</p>
      <p>An investigation into the rampage is under way at HMS Sultan training base in Portsmouth.</p>
      <p>Mike Critchley, a retired lieutenant commander, said: “The situation will be viewed pretty seriously by command at Sultan and appropriately punished.</p>
      <p>" I would expect the sailors involved to be docked their pay and their leave.”</p>

      <p>A source added: “Those responsible could face court martial or fines.”</p>
      <p>The incident is further evidence of a drink problem blighting the forces.</p>
      <p>Some 120 servicemen are feared to be alcohol-dependent, 1,000 a year are treated for alcohol issues and up to 3,000 have been told to seek medical advice.</p>
      <p>MoD figures show up to 66,000 are potentially at risk of alcohol-related harm. Fifteen pints a week is the norm among the heavy-drinking brigade and cheap booze on base fuels the problem.</p>

      <p>The MoD has called in advisers from Public Health England to lead a service-wide alcohol reduction programme.</p>
      <p>A report in the Journal of the Royal Army Medical Corps said: “Alcohol misuse is a health care and organisational concern across the Armed Forces.”</p>
      <p>A Royal Navy spokesman said: “An investigation is under way. It would be inappropriate to comment further.”</p>
