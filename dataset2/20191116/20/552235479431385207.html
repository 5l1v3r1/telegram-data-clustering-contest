      <h1>Rangers star Steven Davis balloons crucial Northern Ireland penalty over bar during Holland qualifier</h1>
      <h2>The Ibrox midfielder has been a crucial presence for the national team in recent years but hit a poor penalty.</h2>

      <p>Rangers midfielder <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-davis">Steven Davis</a> missed a 29th minute penalty in Northern Ireland's crucial qualifier against the Netherlands.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/michael-oneill">Michael O'Neil</a> 's men need to win to have a realistic chance of progress in Group C.</p>
      <p>The penalty was awarded after Ajax defender JoÃ«l Veltman handled in the box but Davis smashed the ball wildly over the top.</p>
      <p>Davis has been a superb international performer, at the forefront of the nation's recent resurgence and has consistently delivered performances for his country.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old, who has enjoyed a solid season with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> so far, is earning his 114th cap tonight.</p>
      <p>Northern Ireland need to win tonight and away in Germany in their final game to ensure qualification through their extremely tough group.</p>
      <p>Manager O'Neil was appointed Stoke City manager just over a week ago but will job share until their <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/euro-2020">Euro 2020</a> campaign is over.</p>
