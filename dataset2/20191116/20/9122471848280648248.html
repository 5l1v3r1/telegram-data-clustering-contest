      <h1>Scott Frost Has Brutally Honest Comment After Loss To Wisconsin</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T20:47:34+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 20:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>Before Nebraska took the field this afternoon against Wisconsin, the athletic department announced a two-year extension for head coach Scott Frost. Unfortunately for the Cornhuskers, they couldn’t follow through with a win this weekend.</p>
      <p>Nebraska needed an upset win to really help its chances of making a bowl game this year.</p>
      <p>The Cornhuskers came out strong and matched the Badgers score for score during the first quarter. However, the defense just couldn’t stop Jonathan Taylor as the game went on.</p>
      <p>Following the loss to Wisconsin, Frost had a brutally honest comment about the team’s season.</p>
      <p>“I’m tired of looking for silver linings,” Frost told the media.</p>
      <p>He also said the team needs to figure out what it’s going to take in order to win.</p>

      <p>This four-game losing streak for Nebraska has really put a damper on the mood in Lincoln. Last month, the team owned a 4-2 record and felt optimistic about making a bowl game.</p>
      <p>At this stage of the season, Nebraska will have to win its final two games against Maryland and Iowa in order to be eligible for a bowl.</p>
      <p>Frost still has a vote of confidence from the football program’s decision makers, but the fans might be running out of patience.</p>
      <p>We’ll see if the Cornhuskers can bounce back next Saturday against the Terrapins.</p>
