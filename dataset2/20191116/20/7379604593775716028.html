And this year it's been particularly bad with the result leaking every single week. So instead of being able to wait and enjoy/suffer through almost 24 hours, someone will leak it online and everything will be ruined. Maybe it's time to move to results show to Saturday night?</li>

I'm looking at you all. But here's that offensive leaderboard just in case you've forgotten the hill that needed to be climbed.</li>

We don't have hours people. VOTE NOW. Don't ruin tomorrow night for us all. I'm going to be live blogging I'm A Celebrity's launch and you do not want me to start demanding crocodiles eat Caitlyn Jenner or EastEnders' Lauren. I can't guarantee that won't happen, but just vote for Michelle and Vogue-ing.</li>

You need to get clicking on't internet and dialling on your phones. I know most of Michelle's fanbase is already well into pre-drinks by now, but that Vogue was for you, so get voting. Plus, I won't stop. It'll be easier in the long run. If you think this is bad, how bad do you think I'll be if she goes home? EXACTLY. Vote. Now.</li>

But if Michelle goes home I think we can declare the experiment with universal suffrage over and done with. LOOK HOW HAPPY SHE WAS TO BE GOING TO BLACKPOOL. NO-ONE'S EVER THAT HAPPY TO BE GOING TO BLACKPOOL.</li>
