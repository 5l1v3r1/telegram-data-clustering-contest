      <h1>Raptors’ OG Anunoby to start vs. Mavericks in return from eye injury</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T20:04:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 20:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/author/sportsnet-staff/" target="_blank">Sportsnet Staff</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/players/og-anunoby/900535">OG Anunoby</a>, who has missed the the <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/teams/toronto-raptors/">Toronto Raptors</a>‘ last game against the Portland Trail Blazers with a right-eye contusion, will be in the starting lineup when the team takes on the Dallas Mavericks on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>The team announced the starting lineup before the game. Joining him will be Fred VanVleet, Norman Powell, Pascal Siakam and Marc Gasol.</p>
      <p>Anunoby was diagnosed with a right-eye contusion after former teammate Kawhi Leonard poked him in the eye while reaching for the ball during the Raptors’ loss to the Los Angeles Clippers on Monday.</p>
      <p>Following the incident, Anunoby went to the locker room and didn’t return. After the game, head coach Nick Nurse said the blow knocked out both of Anunoby’s contacts and left him bleeding.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old consulted with a specialist in Los Angeles before the Raptors’ trip to Portland, according to the team, and did not appear in Toronto’s 114-110 Wednesday night win against the Trail Blazers.</p>
      <p>Anunoby is averaging 13 points, 1.4 blocks, 1.3 steals and 6.2 rebounds across nine games this season, his third campaign in the NBA.</p>
