      <p>Bella Hadid has revealed why she didn’t feel comfortable modelling for Victoria’s Secret and how this superstar made her feel powerful ‘in her underwear’.</p>
      <p>During an onstage chat at the Vogue Fashion Festival in Paris, Bella Hadid admitted that she was never comfortable strutting her stuff in lingerie on the catwalk — that is, until the Savage x Fenty founder came along.</p>
      <p>She also revealed the pressures of being a runway lingerie model could sometimes “(make) you forget how your legs move”.</p>
      <p>“Rihanna’s amazing. For me, that was the first time on a runway that I felt really sexy,” the 23-year-old beauty confessed to director Loïc Prigent, per WWD.</p>

      <p>Hadid, who modelled in both the 31-year-old <i>Diamonds</i> singer’s inaugural Savage x Fenty show in 2018 as well as her second this September, also threw in a dig at Victoria’s Secret, for whom she’s walked the runway three times.</p>
      <p>“When I first did Fenty, I was doing other lingerie shows and I never felt powerful on a runway, like, in my underwear,” she said.</p>
      <p>Hadid added that it was Rihanna’s instruction to “walk any way she wanted” that helped boost her confidence.</p>

      <p>“I like being another character. I think at this point I don’t necessarily love being myself sometimes,” she explained. “Sometimes on the runway you get either nervous or you forget how your legs move.”</p>
      <p>Hadid then opened up further about on her past mental health struggles, saying, “I feel guilty for being able to live this incredible life, have the opportunities that I do, but somehow still be depressed. It doesn’t make sense.”</p>
      <p>In fact, she added, some of her darkest moments came when her fashion career was first taking off. “I would cry every single morning, I would cry during my lunch breaks, I would cry before I slept.</p>
      <p>“I was very emotionally unstable for a while when I was working 14-hour days for four months straight as an 18-year-old. I think I just wanted to breathe a little bit,” she explained.</p>
