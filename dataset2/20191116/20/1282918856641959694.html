      <p>Allies Congress and NCP have already worked out a common minimum programme (CMP) with the Sena for the government. Sources in the Congress and NCP said the draft CMP and allocation of portfolios between the three parties will be discussed in the meeting. The Shiv Sena, NCP, and Congress are busy discussing the nitty-gritty of government formation in the state which is under President's rule since November 12 after the BJP-Sena alliance fell apart over the issue of sharing of chief minister's post.</p>
      <blockquote>"Gandhi and Pawar will meet on Sunday evening to discuss the issues pertaining to government formation in Maharashtra," an NCP source said previously. The NCP wants Congress to be part of the government – instead of the grand old party extending support from outside – to ensure its sustainability, sources said.</blockquote>

      <h3>Three-party delegation’s meeting with Guv postponed</h3>
      <p>A three-party delegation of leaders from the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress, who were supposed to meet the Governor of Maharashtra, Bhagat Singh Koshiyari, to discuss ways to provide a stronger administration to the state has been postponed. Shiv Sena leader Eknath Shinde cited the reason in a statement said that the MLAs were on a tour of their constituencies to take stock of farmer distress and other matter. Earlier, the NCP had asserted that the three-party alliance will successfully complete a full term in Maharashtra. Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge on Friday said that all government formation rumours should be stopped until party chiefs Sharad Pawar and Sonia Gandhi meet. As per sources, the draft for the 'common minimum program', has been prepared and sent to the chiefs of Congress and NCP.</p>
