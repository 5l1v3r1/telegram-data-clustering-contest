      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T20:15:05+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 20:15</time> by <a rel="author">Molly Pike, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/molly-pike/</a></address>
      <p>Perrie Edwards is already getting into the Christmas spirit by giving herself a very festive - and very rude - new nickname.</p>
      <p>The Little Mix singer, 26, called herself "Tinsel T**s" as she sported a Christmassy corset in her latest <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> picture.</p>
      <p>Her eyewateringly tight top had a metallic pink gift bow on one breast and a yellow bow on the other.</p>
      <p>She teamed the corset with some matching frilly sleeves, giving the sexy outfit more of a vintage feel.</p>
      <p>Perrie's blonde bob was worn in chic beachy waves and she sported a striking coat of orange and yellow eyeshadow.</p>
      <p>She captioned the post: "Who's been naughty &amp; who's been nice?"</p>
      <p>Perrie added the hashtag #tinselt**s and included Christmas tree and present emojis.</p>
      <p>Her stunning snap was quickly flooded with compliments from her Instagram followers.</p>

      <p>One commented: "Perrie as a Christmas gift is what I'm living for.</p>
      <p>"Girl, WOW, you are unbelievable," another posted.</p>
      <p>A third wrote: "All I want for Christmas is Perrie Edwards."</p>

      <p>It comes after Perrie hitned that she is engaged to her man Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain after she misspelt his name.</p>
      <p>She claimed she would be able to spell his surname right when it belongs to her and she has to write it "all the time"</p>
      <p>It's only natural engagement talk was swirling as the couple have been going steady for three years and moved in together earlier this year.</p>
