      <p>The colder temperatures in recent days has already seen the first snow fall of the winter here in the South West with the white stuff falling on the moors on Thursday and Friday.</p>
      <p>Now weather experts are suggesting a 'collapsed polar vortex' is predicted to bring 'severe' weather to Europe and parts of the UK need to be braced to feel the bite of subzero temperatures.</p>
      <p>Frosty nights are set to continue over coming days as temperatures plummet to the single digits across much of the UK and winter continues to take hold of the country.</p>
      <p>Meteorologists are warning "severe" conditions are in store for the continent after snowstorms ravaged southeast France, causing at least one death.</p>
      <p>Nowhere in the UK will be spared tomorrow's chill, with forecasters predicting the mercury will drop to the single-digit highs across the country tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Here in the South West it looks set to be the coldest on Monday with temperatures dropping to 1C in both <a href="https://www.devonlive.com/news/devon-news/">Devon</a> and Cornwall, according to the Met Office.</p>

      <p>BBC Weather presenter Helen Willetts has been forecasting some of the cold that is set to take its grip on much of Europe, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/uk-weather-forecast-polar-vortex-20895595">the Mirror reports</a>.</p>
      <p>She said: “The central area of the Mediterranean looking to have some more severe weather.</p>
      <p>"Strong winds continue to push that water and those winds and that rain northwards.</p>
      <p>“Heavy snowfall once again across the Alpine region.</p>
      <p>“To the east of that temperatures are well above average.</p>
      <p>“Temperatures will steadily rise this week across Scandinavia but it’s still cold here, we’ve still got some snow to come.</p>
      <p>“But we’re got more of that rain to come on Monday in very similar areas with quite disturbed weather to come.”</p>
      <p> The Met Office forecast predicts temperatures sinking to  1C for parts of northern Scotland overnight tonight.</p>

      <p>Meteorologist Andrej Flis told <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/weather/1205297/bbc-weather-europe-warning-polar-vortex-snow-winter-floods-snowstorm">the Express </a>: “The weakening of the stratospheric polar vortex is well underway.</p>
      <p>“In the past days, the polar vortex reached 40-year record strength for this time of year. It would likely strengthen even further, but its rise to power was stopped and reversed, due to two pressure/temperature waves that press onto the vortex.</p>
      <p>“That reduces the speed of the stratospheric polar jet stream.</p>
      <p>“That is a strong sign of a collapsed polar vortex, and high probability of a sudden stratospheric warming event by the end of the year.</p>
      <p>“What all this means for our weather? Well, a collapsed vortex always greatly increases the chances for winter weather towards Europe.”</p>
