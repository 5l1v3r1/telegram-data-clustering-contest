      <p>Picture yourself zipping around town in a brand new 2020 GMC Terrain – all for a terrific cause.</p>
      <p>Tickets are on sale now for a car raffle to benefit Stettler’s Heartland Youth Centre, with the sleek and shiny new vehicle provided by Stettler GM.</p>
      <p>“We have been given the opportunity to do a car raffle through Stettler GM,” said Christel Shuckburgh, mentoring coordinator with the local Big Brothers Big Sisters office, which is under the umbrella of the Youth Centre.</p>
      <p>“They’ve donated the vehicle – a 2020 Terrain – in a burgundy/red colour.”</p>
      <p>The raffle was officially launched in September, with the draw date slated for next May.</p>
      <p>“We also have four adult train tickets for the Alberta Prairie Railways.”</p>
      <p>These draws will take place during the 1920s-themed Awesome Auction on May 30th.</p>
      <p>Prior to that, an early bird draw is set for Jan. 6th for a cash prize of $1,000. Should you be lucky enough to win the cash, your ticket will still be re-entered for the grand prize draw next spring as well.</p>
      <p>Tickets, which are $50 each, are available at several venues including the Heartland Youth Centre, Lawlor Jewelry, Woody’s Automotive, Stettler GM, the Shoe Closet, Brennan Auto Body Repair, Bagshaw Electric, Vintage Thistle, The Sweet House, i.d. Apparel and Cuttin’ Corners.</p>
      <p>“Plus, we are also trying to take in as many community events as we can,” added Winnie Bissett, the Youth Centre’s executive director. “Going into 2019, we were looking at different ways to diversify our funding (sources) with the economy getting tighter, so we started with ‘Landlord of the Month’. We’ve had great success with that.”</p>
      <p>Later on, Bissett said that the owner of Stettler GM, Brenda Esquirol, who serves on the Youth Centre’s board, came up with the idea for a car raffle.</p>
      <p>“She presented it to the board and they thought it would be a wonderful opportunity for us,” she said.</p>
      <p>“We also thought it was a great idea because our theme for the auction next year is ‘The Roaring 20s’. So at the auction, we will have some old cars featured. And then to actually be able to draw the winner for the new car is kind of fitting as well.”</p>
      <p>Ultimately, proceeds from all ticket sales will go to support Youth Centre programming.</p>
      <p>Shuckburgh said each donation of $50 via the ticket sales really does go a long way to helping out at the Youth Centre.</p>
      <p>For example, $50 will cover a family membership for one year; it will provide half a tank of gas, two days of snacks, one week’s worth of program materials, staff/volunteer development for one day, two days of fun for a child in the summer or two children’s program fees for a year.</p>
      <p>“By purchasing a ticket, you are also helping us subsidize those families who are in need of support,” added Bissett.</p>
      <p>There are indeed all kinds of worthwhile programs operated out of the Heartland Youth Centre, which is home to the Boys and Girls Club and the Big Brothers, Big Sisters of Stettler.</p>
      <p>A new hospitality program is currently making quite a splash at the Centre as well.</p>
      <p>“We are partnering with the Stettler Outreach School,” said Sara Wengryn, program director of the Boys and Girls Club.</p>
      <p>“The purpose of it is to teach youth various hospitality skills, different job skills, how to present yourself, resume skills, how to approach your supervisor – all of those really valuable, practical job skills.</p>
      <p>”And it really focuses in on the hospitality industry,” she explained. “It’s also a great opportunity for us to partner with the Stettler Outreach School.”</p>
