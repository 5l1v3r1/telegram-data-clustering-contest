      <p>This afternoon’s Michigan-Michigan State game has been ugly and we’re not just talking about the score. Dirty plays have arrived late in Ann Arbor.</p>
      <p>Michigan is leading Michigan State, 34-10, at the start of the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>It’s been a chippy contest all afternoon and we just had an ejection for a dirty play.</p>
      <p>Michigan State defensive lineman Jacub Panasiuk was ejected for a cheap shot on quarterback Shea Patterson.</p>
