      <h1>Damaged caused by Hurricane Dorian totals $3.4B in the Bahamas</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T20:07:46+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 20:07</time> by <a rel="author">Eileen AJ Connelly</a></address>
      <p>Damage from Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas totaled $3.4 billion, equal to about a quarter of the island nation’s annual economic output, a report by the Inter-American Development Bank said.</p>
      <p>That’s equivalent to the United States losing the combined economies of Florida, California and Texas, <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/article237435814.html">the Miami Herald reported.</a> The scale of the damage means the Bahamas has a difficult path to reconstruction.</p>
      <p>The official death toll from the monster storm stands at 67, but <a href="http://idbdocs.iadb.org/wsdocs/getdocument.aspx?docnum=EZSHARE-1256154360-486">the report said</a> 282 people were still missing as of late October. Nearly 29,500 people lost homes or jobs — or both — when the Category 5 storm <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/09/10/thousands-homeless-50-dead-in-bahamas-as-dorian-recovery-continues/">hit Grand Bahama and Abaco islands in early September</a>.</p>
      <p>Abaco was hardest hit, suffering 87 percent of the damage. More than 75 percent of all homes were damaged on the island.</p>
      <p>Reconstruction will require big investments and will take many years, the development bank said.</p>
      <p>Dorian was one of the most powerful Atlantic hurricanes ever to make landfall, unleashing a storm surge of up to 25 feet.</p>
