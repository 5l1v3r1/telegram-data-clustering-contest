      <p>Tess Daly looked utterly stunning tonight - but Strictly viewers were a little distracted by an element of her outfit.</p>
      <p>Wearing a silver wrap dress, she hosted the show tonight alongside co-star Claudia Winkleman.</p>
      <p>But fans kept getting drawn to one of the straps of her dress, which had slid down her shoulder.</p>
      <p>Viewers flocked to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> in frustration. and compared her to EastEnders Karen Taylor, who notoriously has one strap hanging off a shoulder.</p>
      <p>One tweeted: "Can't cope with the strap situation #StrictlyComeDancing2019 #strictlyblackpool #strictly."</p>

      <p>While another commented: "tess daly giving karen taylor a run for her money #Strictly."</p>
      <p>A third remarked: "I have been pretending that Tess's strap doesn't bother me but it does it really does #scd #strictly."</p>

      <p>His partner Katya Jones told him after they were voted out: "Honestly I’m so proud of him and I think after even this dance which I think was your best dance you can leave with your head held up honestly; and in my eyes you’re the winner. The only thing he has lost is weight.</p>
      <p>"He came in every single day giving his heart, soul, everything, 200% no matter what after every single dance off and thank you so much. I’m so sorry I couldn’t take to Blackpool."</p>
