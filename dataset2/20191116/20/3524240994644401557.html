        <b>Olufemi Atoyebi, Lokoja</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Independent National Electoral Commissioner in charge of Information and Voter Education, Festus Okoye has said that election<br/>results from polling units where cases of ballot box-snatching were recorded may be cancelled.</p>
      <p>There were instances of violence, ballot snatching and intimidation during the conduct of governorship and senatorial election in the<br/>Kogi state on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Okoye said results from volatile polling units could be cancelled depending on reports from the presiding officer in such units.</p>
      <p>He added that the commission had yet to be informed by the Peoples Democratic Party that Governor Yahaya Bello and the All<br/>Progressives Congress were allegedly forcing staff of INEC to sign prefilled results.</p>
      <p>He said, “If there were areas where ballot box-snatching was reported, the presiding officer is expected to write a report on such incident to the Electoral Officer stating the issues concerned and how they fill into the guidelines.</p>
      <p>“The report from the presiding officers from such units will help the commission to determine whether the results from such units will be cancelled outrightly or whether a rerun will be ordered or whether the unit will be awarded a zero score.</p>
      <p>“Until such a report is received from the officers on the field, the commission will not make a decision on it.”</p>
      <p>“We have some Resident and National Commissioners and other senior staff of the commission on the field. They are doing their job in accordance with the law.</p>
      <p>“We are not aware of such an incident (that Bello and INEC were forcing INEC staff to sign prefilled results) and if such an incident<br/>is taking place, there will be a report because we have some Resident Electoral Commissioners supervising a cluster of Local Government Areas.”</p>
