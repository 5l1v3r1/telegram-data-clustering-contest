      <p>Harlequins suffered a heavy defeat in their Heineken Champions Cup opener at <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/clermont">Clermont</a> Auvergne on Saturday, losing 53-21.</p>
      <p>The excellent <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/clermont/players/alivereti-raka/">Alivereti Raka</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/clermont/players/peceli-yato/">Peceli Yato</a> scored two tries apiece in a dominant display from the three-time finalists, who were making their return to the competition after failing to qualify for last season’s tournament.</p>

      <p>Clermont opened up a 22-0 lead inside 25 minutes and kept Quins firmly at arm’s length throughout.</p>
      <p>Raka raced clear for Clermont’s opening try after pouncing on a loose pass in the 11th minute, with <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/clermont/players/morgan-parra/">Morgan Parra</a> – who had earlier opened the scoring from the tee – adding the extras in front of the posts.</p>
      <p>Yato then powered over for the first of his double, dragging desperate challenger <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/harlequins/players/marcus-smith/">Marcus Smith</a> behind him, and brushed off <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/harlequins/players/glen-young/">Glen Young</a> to break Quins’ defensive line and charge towards the line for his second.</p>

      <p>Tom Lawday reduced the deficit when he touched down 11 minutes from half-time, but Clermont reasserted their authority on the match when <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/clermont/players/isaia-toeava/">Isaia Toeava</a> collected a <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/clermont/players/george-moala/">George Moala</a> offload to cross the whitewash.</p>
      <p>A driving maul produced a Quins try through <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/harlequins/players/elia-elia/">Elia Elia</a> in the 51st minute, before Clermont spread the ball out to the left wing with the help of a well-judged <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/clermont/players/camille-lopez/">Camille Lopez</a> kick for Raka to cross for his second of the match.</p>
      <p>Lopez was instrumental once again in his side’s sixth try, sending through a chip that was chased down by Moala.</p>
      <p>Quins’ final score of the match deserved better than to be on the losing side, with <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/harlequins/players/gabriel-ibitoye/">Gabriel Ibitoye</a> embarking on a scintillating run before sending <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/harlequins/players/james-lang/">James Lang</a> over.</p>

      <p>But Clermont had the final say in a match they controlled from start to finish, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/grenoble/players/mike-tadjer/">Mike Tadjer</a> applying the finish after a driving maul.</p>
