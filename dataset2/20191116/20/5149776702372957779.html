      <h1>Premier League club 'lining up' £12m January bid for Nottingham Forest ace</h1>
      <h2>Matty Cash has been in fine form for the Reds so far this season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T20:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 20:00</time> by <a rel="author">Sarah Clapson</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a>'s Matty Cash is a £12m target for Everton, according to The Sun.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old has <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-player-ratings-season-3532587">been in good form</a> for the Reds so far this season, helping them challenge towards the top of the Championship under new head coach Sabri Lamouchi.</p>
      <p>And his performances at the City Ground are said to have attracted the attention of Everton, with the Toffees claimed to be "lining up" a £12m move for Cash in January, when the transfer window opens for business.</p>
      <p>The Sun say scouts for the Goodison Park club have watched Cash in action for Lamouchi's Reds this season and <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/always-seen-nottingham-forest-ace-3533123">"like his versatility as a midfielder and full-back".</a></p>
      <p>Crystal Palace and Southampton are also said to be keeping tabs on Cash, who rose through Forest's academy into the first team.</p>
