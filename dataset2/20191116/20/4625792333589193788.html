      <h1>Trump undergoes third medical checkup since taking office</h1>

      <p>President Trump spent part of his Saturday getting his annual physical exam at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland.</p>
      <p>“Anticipating a very busy 2020, the president is taking advantage of a free weekend here in Washington, D.C., to begin portions of his routine annual physical exam,” White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Grisham said later Saturday that Trump had a "quick exam and labs."</p>
      <p>"The President remains healthy and energetic without complaints," she said, adding that he also visited with medical staff and met with the family of a special forces soldier injured in Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>It is Trump’s third medical checkup since entering the White House. He had <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/healthcare/trump-to-have-second-medical-checkup-as-president-on-friday">his last physical in February</a>, after which White House doctor Sean Conley said that Trump, 73, was in “<a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-doctor-says-president-in-very-good-health">very good health</a>.”</p>
      <p>The results of the checkup, however, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/healthcare/trump-neglected-doctors-orders-gained-weight-and-is-now-obese">showed Trump was obese</a>. At 6 feet, 3 inches tall, the president weighed 243 pounds, a 4-pound gain since his first medical exam as president in 2018.</p>
      <p>Trump’s dosage of rosuvastatin, a cholesterol-lowering drug, was increased in February.</p>
      <p>The media heavily scrutinized the results of Trump’s 2018 physical after then-White House doctor Ronny Jackson issued a glowing medical report. Jackson said that while Trump while had “incredibly good genes," he needed to lose weight.</p>
      <p>There are no laws that require presidents to undergo the annual medical exams or release the information to the public.</p>
