      <p>Success Nwogu, Abuja</p>
      <p>The Peoples Democratic Party on Saturday urged the people of Kogi and Bayelsa States to remain alert, resist all undemocratic, violent elements and take all legitimate steps to protect their votes.</p>
      <p>The PDP National Publicity Secretary, Mr Kola Ologbondiyan, in a statement, also charged the Independent National Electoral Commission and security agencies to ensure that nothing happens to the ballots at any level and that results reflect only the will of the people as expressed at the polling units.</p>
      <p>Ologbondiyan also called on the Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, and the military high command to be patriotic by taking measures to protect the people, in their quest to protect their votes.</p>
      <p>He said, “The PDP urges the people of Kogi and Bayelsa State to remain at alert, resist all undemocratic brigand elements and take all legitimate steps to protect their votes to the very end.</p>
      <p>“The party also charges INEC and security forces to ensure that nothing happens to the ballots at every level and that results reflect only the will of the people as expressed at the polling units.</p>
      <p>The IGP should, therefore, beef up security at the collation centres to ensure that only legitimate votes count. This is because any result that does not reflect the will of the people will surely not be accepted.”</p>
