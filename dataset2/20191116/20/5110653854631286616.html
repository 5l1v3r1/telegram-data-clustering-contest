      <h1>Jonathan Drouin injury update: Montreal Canadiens forward placed on IR</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T20:04:09+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 20:04</time> by <a rel="author">Tommy McArdle</a></address>
      <p>The Montreal Canadiens lost one of their top performers Saturday when they <a href="https://twitter.com/CanadiensMTL/status/1195782964094947331">placed forward Jonathan Drouin on injured reserve</a>.</p>
      <p>The team announced that Drouin sustained an upper-body injury during the third period of Friday's 5-2 win over the Washington Capitals.</p>
      <p>Drouin took a huge open-ice hit from Alex Ovechkin in the second period of that game,but <a href="https://twitter.com/renlavoietva/status/1195787388330659840">TVA Sports' Renaud Lavoie reported Saturday that the injury</a> is not related in any way to Ovechkin's hit — which rules out a concussion, head or neck injury.</p>

      <p>The 24-year-old briefly left Friday's game after the Ovechkin hit, but he <a href="https://twitter.com/JFChaumontJDM/status/1195522118366236672">returned for the third period</a>. Drouin finished the game with 12 minutes and 20 seconds played, and the Canadiens made no mention of his injury after the game.</p>
      <p>Losing Drouin for any length of time could prove a tough blow to this Montreal team.Although he has not scored in either of the last two games, his 15 points in 19 games played had put him on pace for a 64-point season, which would be a career-high out of his five NHL seasons. Drouin entered Fridays' game tied for the team's overall scoring lead with Tomas Tatar, who scored four points against the Capitals.</p>
      <p>In Drouin's absence, the Canadiens <a href="https://www.nhl.com/canadiens/news/hudon-recalled-from-laval-drouin-placed-on-injured-reserve/c-311382602?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=CHCcontent&amp;utm_content=EN-1116-HudonDrouin">recalled forward Charles Hudon</a> from their AHL affiliate, the Laval Rocket.</p>
      <p>The Canadiens host the New Jersey Devils on Saturday at the Bell Centre at 7 p.m. ET.</p>
