      <h1>'Vital' - Wolves' best player in the Premier League this season revealed</h1>
      <h2>Latest Wolverhampton Wanderers news | Nuno's side have picked up 16 points from their opening 12 Premier League fixtures - we take a look at who has stood out the most</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T20:50:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 20:50</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Husband, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/ben-husband/, Mark Wakefield</a></address>
      <p>Wolverhampton Wanderers have enjoyed a steady start to their second season back in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Going into the November international break, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/nuno-espirito-santo">Nuno Espirito Santo</a> 's side have racked up 16 points from their opening 12 league fixtures.</p>
      <p>Their final fixture before the two-week hiatus saw <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> claim a 2-1 win over local rivals Aston Villa at Molineux.</p>
      <p>As we are in the midst of the international break, we thought it would be the perfect opportunity to reflect on the campaign so far.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> reporter Alex Dicken has rated every old gold player after every Premier League game.</p>
      <p>Here's how they have fared and how they rank alongside their teammates:</p>
      <p>
        <i>Note: Four players have not been included as they have played less than 200 minutes in the league, their ratings are as follows: Ruben Vinagre (6.50), Pedro Neto (5.80), Morgan Gibbs-White (5.50) and Jesus Vallejo (5.00).</i>

      <h4>1. Adama Traore – 7.36 (Mins played 832)</h4>
      <p>Who would have thought that a player many questioned in the summer, would be unquestionably Wolves’ player of the season so far?</p>
      <p>He has become a vital cog in Nuno’s counter attacking plan and whether utilised at right wing-back or as part of the front three, he has thrived.</p>
      <p>Rivalling Matt Doherty is no easy task, but the Spaniard is now an able deputy, with many believing he warrants a start most weeks.</p>
      <p>And that Etihad performance will live long in the memory. As close to perfect as possible.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>2. Joao Moutinho – 7.17 (Mins played 990)</h4>
      <p>After a surprising name at the top of the list, second in the running will raise no eyebrows.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old continues to defy his advancing years and has been comfortably the best Wolves midfield player again. His calmness and composure is a joy to behold and his wave to the South Bank when he takes corners still makes thousands burst into spontaneous applause.</p>
      <p>Sign him up!</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>3. Raul Jimenez – 6.88 (Mins played 1036)</h4>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/raul-jimenez">Jimenez</a> , understandably, looked a little jaded at the beginning of the season with another busy summer behind him - but he's benefited hugely from a rest during October's international break.</p>
      <p>Jimenez has scored five in his last six matches for Wolves to take his tally to 13 across all competitions this season.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>4. Matt Doherty – 6.80 (Mins played 711)</h4>
      <p>Injuries have disrupted his early season form. But in the last few games, the right-back has returned to the form that made him one of the best performers in his position across the continent last term.</p>
      <p>He's also developed an excellent partnership with Traore down the right and could go close to his eight-goal haul from last season.</p>

      <h4>5. <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/rui-patricio">Rui Patricio</a> – 6.79 (Mins played 1080)</h4>
      <p>The Portuguese came to the club in the summer of 2018 with a reputation as one of the best keepers in Europe and his start to the season has done nothing to harm that opinion.</p>
      <p>One area that had been pinpointed for improvement was his distribution, but this season there have been no such issues. Absolutely irreplaceable.</p>
      <h4>6. Leander Dendoncker – 6.71 (Mins played 952)</h4>
      <p>Dendoncker was a model of consistency after his introduction at the turn of the year, allowing his Portuguese colleagues to flourish.</p>
      <p>He started this campaign slowly but Dendoncker has returned to his usual reliable self in the past couple of months. His transition to centre-back has been seamless.</p>

      <h4>7. Willy Boly – 6.50 (Mins played 720)</h4>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/willy-boly">Boly</a> has been absolutely immense at times this season and Wolves will miss him while he's out injured with a fractured fibula.</p>
      <p>The defender's performances were outstanding prior to his injury and his rating would be a lot higher had it not been for his dismissal at Everton in September.</p>
      <h4>8. <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/diogo-jota">Diogo Jota</a> – 6.50 (Mins played 725)</h4>
      <p>Jota scored the last-gasp goal at Crystal Palace which kick-started Wolves' Premier League season.</p>
      <p>After looking every bit the player that destroyed Premier League defences last term, Jota’s form has taken a downturn, although we have since learned that was due to injury.</p>
      <p>The all action forward has been showing signs of a return to form in recent weeks.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article16962334.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Crystal-Palace-v-Wolverhampton-Wanderers-Premier-League-Selhurst-Park.jpg"/>

      <h4>9. Ruben Neves – 6.50 (Mins played 872)</h4>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/ruben-neves">Neves</a> ' season has finally kicked into gear in recent weeks. The midfielder has been pushed further forward and he's thriving alongside Moutinho.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old's goal against Villa before the international break is hopefully a sign of things to come.</p>
      <h4>10. Ryan Bennett – 6.40 (Mins played 460)</h4>
      <p>Bennett is very much a fringe player now with Dendoncker, Coady and Saiss Nuno's first choice back three.</p>
      <p>Injury prevented Bennett from staking his claim to replace Boly and he'll now have to wait his turn for another chance to impress in the Premier League.</p>

        <figcaption>(Image: PA)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h4>11. Jonny Casto Otto – 6.32 (Mins played 910)</h4>
      <p>After a slow start, the Spaniard has now looked the player that Wolves saw enough in to splash £15m on in January.</p>
      <p>Now has a definite deputy in Vinagre, who while offers more going forward, is no match for Jonny’s defensive abilities.</p>
      <p>Jonny has so often been Wolves' unsung hero but fans have been quick to point out his tremendous showings of late.</p>
      <h4>12. Conor Coady – 6.25 (Mins played 1080)</h4>
      <p>It will come as no surprise that <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/conor-coady">Coady</a> has played every second of Wolves’ Premier League campaign so far.</p>
      <p>But his performances have come under scrutiny, particularly at the start of the season. Coady was at fault for goals against Everton and Chelsea but he's sharpened up in recent weeks and should climb this list.</p>

      <h4>2000+ VOTES SO FAR</h4>
      <p>Group Stages Last 32 Last 16 Quarter Final Semi Final Runner-up Winner</p>
      <h4>13. Patrick Cutrone – 6.08 (Mins played 283)</h4>
      <p>Already a cult hero on the terraces. The former AC Milan striker has endeared himself to supporters with his passionate and whole-hearted displays.</p>
      <p>Should have more than his solitary Premier League strike, after fluffing a number of chances, none more so than his one-on-one against Ederson in the win over City.</p>
      <p>Cutrone will have to bide his time for another chance with Jimenez performing superbly of late.</p>
      <h4>14. Romain Saiss – 5.94 (Mins played 604)</h4>
      <p>Has been Nuno’s preferred centre back since Bennett’s removal from the squad. Rather than Vallejo, Wolves have turned to the defensive midfielder to solidify a wobbly defensive unit.</p>
      <p>His red card against Crystal Palace was beyond poor, but he's improved a lot over the past few matches.</p>
