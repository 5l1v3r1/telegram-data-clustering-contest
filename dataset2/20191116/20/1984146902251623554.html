      <p>Chris Ramsey and partner Karen Hauer were the first to dance on Strictly and boy did they open the show in style!</p>
      <p>Dressed in fuchsia pink and accompanied by eight backing dancers, they did a funky salsa to Mark Ronson &amp; Bruno Mars' Uptown Funk. The audience were on their feet - and so were judges Bruno Toniolli and chief judge Shirley Ballas.</p>
      <p>Bruno said: "You really have started Happy Hour across the nation. You looked like you were in a boy band. Your hips have started to unclog - the Draino has worked. Much more serpentine."</p>
      <p>Chris tweeted afterwards: "Well, what did you think of that? Holy Moly!"</p>
      <p>The couple scored two nines - from Shirley and Bruno, an eight from Motsi and a seven from Craig who told him: "It lacked flow but the timing wasn't bad and you fitted in with the group which is no mean feat as they are all professional dancers. You have upped your game!"</p>
      <p>Motsi described the dance as "slick, fun and energetic" and Shirley said: "You hadn't danced in front of anyone nine weeks ago and look at you now! You brought your groove. You were all and everything I expected to start the show for Blackpool."</p>
      <p>The bookies had earmarked <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/chris-ramsey">Chris</a> as the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/latest-strictly-come-dancing-odds-17263049">one to leave</a> this week as the BBC1 show moved to Blackpool's Tower Ballroom. Wife Rosie chose to stay home with son Robin for a big family Strictly party at her mum's house in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/south-shields">South Shields</a> - and she Instagrammed the whole room screaming and jumping about in excitement at Chris's performance.</p>
      <p>And at South Shields Customs House the show had a free screening to support the home-town man of the moment. Dame Bella's tweeted: "Massive excitement here."</p>
      <p>Viewer Shona Tyler tweeted: "Hats off to Chris Ramsey, that was a great performance! You brought the fun to Blackpool" and Mark Jowett agreed, tweeting: "Great start from @IAmChrisRamsey and @karen_hauer . Some brilliant lead work from Chris in that Salsa as well! In time!"</p>
      <p>After the dance, which included him getting a lift as he went head over heels, Chris described the atmosphere as "electric" and said: "It's an honour to open the show. That was amazing, I always wanted to be in a music video and I feel like I have just lived it."</p>
      <p>In the next dance veteran Strictly star Anton Du Beke got his first 10s after 17 series for his foxtrot with celebrity partner Emma Barton.</p>
