      <p>The singer, whose real name is William Adams, detailed his clash with a flight attendant on a Qantas flight from Brisbane to Sydney.</p>
      <p>“I’m currently on a flight from Brisbane to Sydney. I’m sorry to say me and my group have experienced they [sic] worse service due to a [sic] overly aggressive flight attendant,” he said in a series of messages. “I don’t want to believe she racist. But she has clearly aimed all her frustrations only at the people of colour.”</p>

      <p>The incident appeared to have something to do with the performer missing an announcement due to his noise-cancelling headphones — an incident that ultimately resulted in police confronting him upon his arrival.</p>
      <p>“I think I was targeted,” will.i.am mused.</p>

      <p>“I was intimidated by 5 police officers when I landed…for what?” he asked. “I put away my laptop when she asked…why would she feel threatened by me to call the police? What did I do wrong? I wasn’t out of hand.. I was polite &amp; did what she asked… now you’re asking me to take abuse?”</p>

      <p>The Grammy-winner received backlash for airing his complaint publicly but argued that he was posting it so “this doesn’t happen again…it shouldn’t happen to a [sic] Aboriginal, Latino, African, LGBTQ White, Red or anyone.”</p>
      <p>“Everyone deserves to be treated with respect,” he continued.</p>

      <p>He also urged his followers to refrain from issuing threats of harm or hate, calling it “uncalled for.”</p>
      <p>“I don’t support abuse &amp; attacks like this,” he wrote in part. “I hope that everyone can be more compassionate &amp; understanding towards one another…because it was the lack of compassion that caused this #noH8.”</p>

      <p>“I don’t regret my actions of taking to public to speak for the other for those who don’t have the voice who felt the same disrespect… I am saddened that People chose to spread hate and attack… there were other people on the flight were disrespected,” he said.</p>

      <p>A spokesperson for Qantas <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/william-racist-airport-flight-attendant-laptop-police-australia-a9205401.html">denied</a> the accusations of racism in a statement to <i>The Independent</i>, describing the situation as a “misunderstanding on board.”</p>
      <p>“There was a misunderstanding on board, which seems to have been exacerbated by will.i.am wearing noise-canceling headphones and not being able to hear instructions from crew,” the spokesman said.</p>
      <p>“We completely reject the suggestion this had anything to do with race,” the spokesman added. “We’ll be following up with will.i.am and wish him well for the rest of the tour.”</p>
