      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T20:20:04+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 20:20</time> by <a rel="author">Phil Cardy, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/phil-cardy/</a></address>
      <p>Defiant Emmerdale star Michelle Hardwick has told of her pride at helping fans of the soap come out as gay.</p>
      <p>The lesbian actress revealed she gets trolled over her role as Charity Dingle’s fiancée Vanessa Woodfield – but the homophobic taunts are far outnumbered by messages of support.</p>
      <p>Michelle, 43, said: “I get a few, ‘You just need a real man’, or ‘Vanessa just needs a real man’ comments. You think, ‘Oh right, really?’</p>
      <p>“And then you look at their profile picture and you think, ‘Yep, you’d be it’.</p>
      <p>“But soaps are fabulous at normalising same-sex relationships. If you’re showing two males or two females, you are normalising it in people’s houses every night and that’s what we need to be doing.”</p>

      <p>Michelle, who married Emmerdale producer Kate Brooks in September, said fans are largely “very supportive” – and even thankful for her role as the show’s feisty vet.</p>
      <p>She said: “I had a tweet only the other day from a girl saying she was so scared to come out to her dad – but he said to her, ‘Look, as long as you’re happy, I’m happy’.</p>
      <p>"So I tweeted her and said, ‘I’m proud of you. I’m proud of your dad’. If we’re helping even just that one girl, then it’s absolutely brilliant.”</p>
      <p>She thinks Vanessa’s relationship with Charity, played by Emma Atkins, could also be a hit with fans “because we’re older women, in our 40s”.</p>
      <p>She added: “It might even be the way they got together. They didn’t necessarily like each other. It was an attraction that happened naturally and they were fighting it.</p>

      <p>Speaking about her first same-sex relationship at 18 she said: “I tried to fight it. I had a few boyfriends, but it never felt right. You just battle with it, don’t you? It was hard.”</p>
      <p>Michelle didn’t come out to her family until her late 20s. “I was scared about upsetting them,” she said. “But they’ve been so supportive.”</p>
      <p>Speaking about her recent marriage in Memphis to Kate, she added: “We’re still on cloud nine. It was the best day of my life.”</p>
      <p>But she’s not expecting Vanessa and ­Charity’s big day to go as well.</p>
      <p>She said: “If Emmerdale weddings are anything to go by, it can’t just go smoothly, can it? I’d be very shocked if it did.”</p>
