      <p>Anton du Beke's partnerships with some of the older contestants of Strictly Come Dancing are legendary but this week he scored his first 10s in 17 years on the show.</p>
      <p>Anton, who has never won, partnered Susannah Constantine last year and former partners also included Esther Rantzen, Ann Widdecombe, Nancy Dell'Olio, Judy Murray, Lesley Joseph and Ruth Langsford.</p>
      <p>EastEnders actress Emma Barton and Anton danced the American Smooth to Let's Face the Music and Dance complete with feathers, top hat and tails.</p>
      <p>Anton is dubbed "the king of ballroom" and Emma was absolutely thrilled saying it was "the most magical day ever."</p>
      <p>The couple got 10s from Shirley and Bruno, eight from Craig and nine from Motsi Mabuse. Anton fell to his knees as fellow competitors chanted Emma's name. "First ever 10s. Seventeen series, you don't understand. This is how Kevin Clifton feels!"</p>
      <p>Viewer Karen Dawson tweeted: "Awwww how lovely. First ever 10s for Anton. Beautiful dance."</p>
      <p>Anthony Turner tweeted: "First time I've seen Anton almost lost for words getting two 10s but well deserved."</p>
      <p>And Jessica Lawton tweeted: "I seriously just cried into my spag bol after Emma and Anton got 10s AMAZING" while Highkick AJ added: "17 series, Was that really Anton's first ever 10?? EVER??? Well BBC now you know the type of star to pair him up with next year, SOMEONE WHO CAN DANCE!"</p>
