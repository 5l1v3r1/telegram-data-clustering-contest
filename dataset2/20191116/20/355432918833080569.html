      <h1>Trump undergoes 'portions' of annual physical exam</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T20:58:26+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 20:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/brett-samuels" target="_blank">Brett Samuels</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a> on Saturday began portions of his annual physical exam at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, the White House said. </p>
      <p>"Anticipating a very busy 2020, the President is taking advantage of a free weekend here in Washington, D.C., to begin portions of his routine annual physical exam at Walter Reed," press secretary <a href="https://thehill.com/people/stephanie-grisham">Stephanie Grisham</a> said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Trump did not have anything on his public schedule on Saturday, but he departed the White House at 2:15 p.m. and arrived at the medical center about 30 minutes later.</p>
      <p>The president left Walter Reed at about 5 p.m. after "a quick exam and labs," Grisham said. He also spent time greeting medical staff there and the family of a soldier injured in Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>The White House said Trump "remains healthy and energetic without complaints," and pointed to his "repeated vigorous rally performances."</p>
      <p>It's unclear when Trump might undergo the rest of his annual checkup.</p>
      <p>Trump underwent <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/430089-trump-physician-releases-full-results-of-medical-exam">his most recent medical exam</a> in February. The president’s height was listed at 6 feet, 3 inches, and his weight was 243 pounds, up from 239 pounds in January 2018.</p>
      <p>Trump’s body mass index, a measure of body weight based on height, was listed 30.4, putting him in the category of obese. The president's total cholesterol was 196 mg/dL, down from 223 the prior year. But his daily dosage of the drug rosuvastatin was increased to 40 milligrams daily.</p>
      <p>Navy Cdr. Sean Conley, physician to the president, said at the time that there were "no findings of significance or changes to report on his physical exam, including the eyes, ears, nose, mouth, teeth/gums, heart, lungs, skin, gastrointestinal, and neurologic systems."</p>
      <p>The health report released in February did not indicate that Trump took a cognitive exam during his most recent checkup.</p>
