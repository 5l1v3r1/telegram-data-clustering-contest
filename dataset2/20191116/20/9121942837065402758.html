      <p>DALLAS (AP) — Luka Doncic had 26 points and 15 rebounds and the Dallas Mavericks beat the Toronto Raptors 110-102 on Saturday night</p>
      <p>Doncic scored nine points in the fourth quarter as the Mavericks added to a one-point lead. He made all seven free throws in the quarter and finished with a career-best 15 free throws in 19 attempts.</p>
      <p>Delon Wright finished with 15 points, and banked in a fadeaway with 5 seconds left in the third quarter to send Dallas into the fourth quarter with a 78-77 edge. Wright added six points in the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>Kristaps Porzingis had 20 points and matched his career best with 15 rebounds for Dallas. Seth Curry scored 15 points, and Dorian Finney-Smith and Maxi Kleber had 10 apiece.</p>
      <p>For Toronto, Norman Powell scored a season-high 26 points, including 13 in the fourth quarter. Fred VanVleet added 25 points, Pascal Siakam had 15 on 10-for-24 shooting, and Matt Thomas scored 10.</p>
      <p>The Mavericks used a 15-0 run in the first quarter to transform a 10-3 deficit into an 18-10 lead. Kleber scored the first five points, and Finney-Smith ended the run with a layup 3½ minutes later.</p>
      <p>Advertising</p>
      <p>Dallas led 32-22 after the first quarter, with Doncic scoring 14 points. VanVleet had 10 for Toronto, which shot 30% (6 for 20) from the floor.</p>
      <p>The Raptors roared back in the second quarter, shooting 61% (14 for 23) and outscoring the Mavericks 38-21 for a 60-53 halftime lead. Powell scored eight points in a 13-4 run that took Toronto from four points down five points ahead at 49-44.</p>
      <p>Porzingis stepped up in the third quarter, scoring nine points, beginning with a 3-pointer that stopped a 10-2 run and gave Dallas a 63-62 advantage.</p>
      <p>TIP-INS</p>
      <p>Raptors: In Matt Thomas’s ninth NBA game, he scored a career-high 10 points, all in the second quarter. He had scored eight twice before. … Norman Powell had a chance for a 4-point play in the fourth quarter, but he missed the free throw after Dallas’s Jalen Brunson fouled him on the shot.</p>
      <p>Mavericks: A video review showed that a shot by Kristaps Porzingis in the second quarter left his hand after 24 seconds expired, so 2 points were deducted from the scoreboard. … The game matched the NBA’s fifth-leading scorer Luka Doncic (28.7ppg.) and eighth-leading scorer Pascal Siakam (27.2 ppg.).</p>
      <p>UP NEXT</p>
      <p>Raptors: Return home for two games, beginning Monday against Charlotte.</p>
      <p>Mavericks: Play the second of a four-game homestand on Monday against San Antonio.</p>
