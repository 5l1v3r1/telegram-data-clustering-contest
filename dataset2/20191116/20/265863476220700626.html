      <p>Candiace Dillard is feeling the heat from her feud with co-star Monique Samuels. The Real Housewives of Potomac star took to Instagram to call out Monique for pulling a shady move.</p>
      <p>Dillard was scheduled to perform the National Anthem at a sports game in DC but has since been replaced.</p>
      <p>The Bravolebrity posted a photo of the flyer for the event and explained to followers: ‘When your lackey’s have nothing better to do than to crawl around on their hands and knees behind closed doors; attempting to throw dirt on my name, fighting a losing war alongside their harrowing employer…<br/>For my beautiful followers who were prepared to celebrate with me at the @washingtonfusion game as I performed the #NationalAnthem, I regret that I must inform you all: I will not be able to perform on Saturday. This turn of events and my removal from the program by @sweetcookie100 by way of #moniquesamuels is for the fulfillment of a personal vendetta over ones own indiscretions. I look forward your next hat trick, saints. For my friends and followers: stay tuned for my next ❤️AMAZING❤️project featuring some incredible talents for the collaboration of a lifetime. I can’t wait to share it with you!!! #ISeeYou.’</p>

      <p>Samuels clapped back in her Instagram Stories.</p>
      <p>‘Over here minding my business and here she go with my name in her mouth. Seriously? Boo bo you are not, never was and will never be that important to me. People with no REAL responsibilities crack me up!!! As if I have time to care about your failed attempts at being booked. You’re laughable. Keep showing the world how obsessed you are.’</p>
      <p>She went on to say that she will be speaking to her attorney about ‘harassment and defamation of character.’</p>
      <p>This all comes after it was revealed that Monique has counter-filed a complaint against Candiace for second-degree assault.</p>
      <p>Do you think these ladies will ever make peace?</p>
