      <h1>'She’s in a cult': George Conway 'can make' marriage work if Kellyanne leaves White House</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T20:29:19+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 20:29</time> by <a rel="author">John Gage</a></address>
      <p>George Conway reportedly wants to make his marriage with White House counselor Kellyanne Conway last but has been telling those around him she will have to get out of the White House "cult" first.</p>
      <p>Three sources close to George <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/11/kellyanne-caught-in-west-wing-cross-fire-as-george-goes-full-resistance">told</a> <i>Vanity Fair</i> this week that he has begun to grow distant from Kellyanne since the start of the impeachment proceedings against President Trump.</p>
      <p>"He tells people she's in a cult," one of the sources said, while a friend of his added, "He’s going through a tough time."</p>
      <p>"It's not going to get better until she's cast out of the cult," another source said.</p>
      <p>The sources alleged that he is still in love with his wife but said she needs quit working for the president before they "can make it work."</p>
      <p>This comes as <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/i-dont-frankly-want-to-be-on-television-george-conway-makes-rare-tv-appearance-for-impeachment-hearings">George made a rare cable</a> television appearance on MSNBC to weigh in on this week's public impeachment hearings. Kellyanne later <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/im-embarrassed-for-you-kellyanne-conway-steams-after-clip-of-husbands-msnbc-commentary-played">tore into both MSNBC</a> and CNN for giving her husband coverage, saying the networks were only doing it to get under her skin.</p>
      <p>"You wanted to put it in my husband’s voice because you think somehow that that will help your ratings or that you’re really sticking it to Kellyanne Conway. And let me be very clear. You didn’t stick it to Kellyanne Conway," she said Thursday. "I think you embarrassed yourself, and I’m embarrassed for you."</p>
      <p>The counselor to the president has objected to reporting on her marriage in the past, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/powerful-woman-kellyanne-conway-mocks-and-threatens-reporter-for-mentioning-her-husband-audio">telling a <i>Washington Examiner</i> reporter</a> last month, "He gets his power through me, if you haven’t noticed. Not the other way around."</p>
      <p>"I just am wondering why in God’s earth you would need to mention anything about George Conway’s tweets in an article that talks about me as possibly being chief of staff," she said before threatening to investigate the reporter's personal life.</p>
      <p>Kellyanne has found a defender in the president's son, Donald Trump Jr., who chastised George for <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/youre-a-disgrace-don-trump-jr-claims-george-conway-routinely-publicly-embarrasses-his-wife">"routinely &amp; publicly"</a> embarrassing his wife on Friday, tweeting, "I'm sure your family really appreciates it, George. You're a disgrace."</p>
