      <p>Harry Wilson scored once and set a goal up as well as Wales beat Azerbaijan this evening, keeping their hopes of automatic qualification for Euro 2020 alive.</p>
      <p>Wales will qualify without the need for a playoff game if they beat Hungary in Cardiff in the final fixture of their qualifying campaign and Slovakia drop points against Croatia later today or against Azerbaijan on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Kieffer Moore‚Äôs headed opener was provided by Wilson before he then scored this goal a few minutes later to give his country a crucial win.</p>
