      <p>IT IS often said that persistence pays off. This at least came true in the case of Anik Shah, whose helmet was stolen from an ATM at Thakur complex in Kandivali on July 10. With Shah continuously pursuing the case, the Samta Nagar police on November 11 registered an FIR on charges of theft against an unknown person for a helmet worth Rs 1,000.</p>
      <p>Shah, who is employed with a sales company, said the incident took place around 10 pm. “While withdrawing money, I kept my helmet on the top of the ATM. I forget it there and came home,” said Shah, adding that he didn’t realise that his helmet was missing until he had to go to work on July 12.</p>
      <p>“I returned to the ATM kiosk and could not find the helmet. I inquired with the guard at the ATM and then went to the Samta Nagar police station and filed a missing complaint,” he said. Following this, Shah persistently started to pursue the case with the police. “My week offs are on Monday. So, every Monday, I visit the police station,” said Shah.</p>
      <p>With not much progress being made and an FIR yet to be registered, Shah approached the bank, which had installed the ATM. The bank gave him access to CCTV camera footage of July 10. “In the CCTV footage, I could see that after I left the ATM, two men entered the kiosk and left after withdrawing money. After that another person came in. He spotted my helmet and took it away,” said Shah.</p>
      <p>He then went to the police station and told the officers about this. Following this, the police sent a constable with him to the bank, which handed over CCTV footages and details of transactions that had taken place between 10 pm to 11 pm on July 10. “I kept visiting the police station asking for updates and demanding that an FIR be registered. A few days ago, I got a call from the police. My statement was recorded and a case was registered,” he said.</p>
      <p>When contacted, senior Inspector Raju Kasbe of Samta Nagar police said, “We have registered a case and are trying to trace the culprit.” Asked about the delay in registering the FIR, Kasbe claimed: “He had approached us recently and not four months ago.”</p>
