      <h1>Falkirk sack Ray McKinnon as League One strugglers call time on ill-fated reign</h1>
      <h2>The 49-year-old has paid the price for an up and down start to the season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T20:56:04+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 20:56</time> by <a rel="author">Graeme Young, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/graeme-young/</a></address>
      <p>Ray McKinnon has been sacked as <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/falkirk-fc">Falkirk</a> boss after the League One side's latest stuttering result.</p>
      <p>The 49-year-old has paid the price for an up and down start to the season with the pre-season title contenders sitting in fourth place.</p>
      <p>And the Bairns have moved quickly to remove McKinnon after the 1-1 draw Dumbarton leaves them three points behind league leaders Airdrie.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dundee-united-fc">Dundee United</a> boss caused controversy when he left <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/greenock-morton-fc">Morton</a> in August 2018 to join Falkirk just weeks into his reign at Cappielow.</p>
      <p>And McKinnon couldn't revive slumping Falkirk as they were relegated from the Championship last season.</p>
      <p>He was backed in the summer transfer window but results haven't improved with just six wins from 14 league games.</p>

      <p>It comes just after Falkirk called time on American-based businessman Mark Campbell's pursuit of the club.</p>
      <p>The club released a brief statement on Saturday evening announcing his exit.</p>
      <p>It read: "Falkirk FC can confirm that Ray McKinnon and Darren Taylor have been relieved of their duties as first team manager and assistant manager with immediate effect.</p>
      <p>"Interim chairman, Lex Miller and the board of directors wish to place on record their best wishes to Ray and Darren for the future."</p>
      <p>McKinnon appeared in a sombre mood just hours ago as he discussed his side's dreary display against Dumbarton.</p>
      <p>He said: "The late goal is scant consolation. We come here wanting the three points, we've walked away with one. So I'm really disappointed with the performance and result today.</p>
      <p>"I just think today we were below average right through the team. There were a lot of stray passes and never had a flow to our game.</p>
      <p>"There's maybe a wee lack of confidence as well. If you pull all that together you get a below average performance and that's what we got."</p>
