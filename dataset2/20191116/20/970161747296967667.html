      <p>Holly Willoughby was forced to park her swanky Mercedes jeep in a disabled bay, after getting a flat tyre.</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old’s day in London wasn’t without a hitch after car troubles put a spanner in the works.</p>
      <p>She was spotted jumping out of the passenger seat of her £100,000 G-Class 4 x 4 – which was half-parked in a disabled spot – and waiting for help to arrive.</p>
      <p>And, thankfully a mechanic arrived shortly after, popping underneath the car to fix the issue so she could get back on with her day.</p>
      <p>Not even a flat tyre could hamper the This Morning host’s style stakes – she was all kinds of chic in a black and white coat, coupled with black trousers and a printed jumper.</p>
      <p>While <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/im-celebrity-stars-dive-right-ant-dec-kick-off-series-style-11149553/">she might not be in the Australian jungle</a>, she added a pair of black sunglasses to her outfit.</p>

      <p>‘We can’t wait to bring our audiences an even greater abundance of personalities, surprises, warmth and humour and a bigger and better schedule for 2020.’</p>
      <p>While Kevin Lygo, ITV Director of Television, said: ‘Live television is at the core of what ITV does and what we bring to viewers.</p>
      <p>‘Our new schedule presents the opportunity to engage with our audience throughout the first part of each day, with some of the most well-known shows on television, in a way that no other channel does.’</p>
      <p>Holly and Phil are collecting serious bag for that extra half-an-hour of work a day, with reports claiming they are set to earn £150,000 extra a year.</p>
      <p>Not too shabby…</p>
