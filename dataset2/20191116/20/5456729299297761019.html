      <p>The Nigerian Civil Society Situation Room has said electoral violence and vote-buying were rife in Saturday governorship election in Kogi State.</p>
      <p>The organisation said this in an interim statement on the poll on Saturday.</p>
      <p>It said attacks on electoral observers, vote-buying and electoral violence happened despite the heavy presence of security officials.</p>
      <p>The statement signed by Dudu Manuga and Celestine Odo decried the attitude of politicians and political parties.</p>
      <p>“At this time we are receiving incidents of vote-buying across the state with a systematic approach by politicians,” the statement said.</p>
      <p>“These occurred in about 60 per cent of the polling units where Situation Room observed.”</p>
      <p>“It was visible seeing politicians distributing N6,000 per person in Olamaboro LGA Ward at Ogugu polling unit 004,” it said.</p>
      <p>PREMIUM TIMES earlier reported how gunshots continued in various parts of Lokoja, the capital city, where hoodlums carted away several ballot boxes, ending the process abruptly for many voters.</p>
      <p>Election observers had predicted violence and disruption of votes but INEC and the police had assured of their preparedness to conduct the election in a peaceful manner.</p>
      <p>But the group said“the large presence of security officials has not deterred thugs from instigating and perpetrating violence.</p>
      <p>“In Ayingba Dekina LGA, PU 003, 005, 009, 025 and 026 etc, ballot boxes were snatched and some destroyed.</p>
      <p>“In Ijumu LGA at Aiyetoro ward 1, Polling Unit 004, thugs were seen snatching ballot boxes and a voter was shot.” they added.</p>
      <p>The election is mainly between Governor Yahaya Bello of the All Progressive Congress and Musa Wada of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party.</p>
