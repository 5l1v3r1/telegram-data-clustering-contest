      <p>NEWS RELEASE<br/>UNIVERSITY OF WATERLOO<br/>*************************<br/>A small, inexpensive sensor could save lives by triggering an alarm when children or pets are left alone in vehicles.</p>
      <p>The new device, developed by researchers at the University of Waterloo, combines radar technology with artificial intelligence (AI) to detect unattended children or animals with 100-per-cent accuracy.</p>
      <p>Small enough to fit in the palm of a hand at just three centimetres in diameter, the device is designed to be attached to a vehicle's rear-view mirror or mounted on the ceiling.</p>
      <p>It sends out radar signals that are reflected back by people, animals and objects in the vehicle. Built-in AI then analyzes the reflected signals.</p>
      <p>'It addresses a serious, world-wide problem.' said George Shaker, an engineering professor at Waterloo in the release, 'This system is so affordable it could become standard equipment in all vehicles.'</p>
      <p>Development of the wireless, disc-shaped sensor was funded in part by a major automotive parts manufacturer that is aiming to bring it to market by the end of 2020.</p>
      <p>Analysis by the device determines the number of occupants and their locations in a vehicle. That information could be used to set rates for ride-sharing services and toll roads, or to qualify vehicles for car-pool lanes.</p>
      <p>Its primary purpose, however, is to detect when a child or pet has been accidentally or deliberately left behind, a scenario that can result in serious harm or death in extremely hot or cold weather.</p>
      <p>In such cases, the system would prevent vehicle doors from locking and sound an alarm to alert the driver, passengers and other people in the area that there is a problem.</p>
      <p>'Unlike cameras, this device preserves privacy and it doesn't have any blind spots because radar can penetrate seats, for instance, to determine if there is an infant in a rear-facing car seat.' said Shaker, a cross-appointed professor of electrical and computer engineering, and mechanical and mechatronics engineering, in the release.</p>
      <p>The low-power device, which runs on a vehicle's battery, distinguishes between living beings and inanimate objects by detecting subtle breathing movements.</p>
      <p>Researchers are now exploring the use of that capability to monitor the vital signs of drivers for indications of fatigue, distraction, impairment, illness or other issues.</p>
      <p>Shaker supervised graduate students Mostafa Alizadeh and Hajar Abedi on the research.</p>
      <p>A paper on their project, low-cost low-power in-vehicle occupant detection with mm-wave FMCW radar, was recently presented at an international conference in Montreal.</p>
