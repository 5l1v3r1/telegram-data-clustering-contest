      <p>An Israeli walking Saturday morning in the Shaar Hanegev Regional Council noticed a suspicious balloon at the entrance to one of the Israeli communities.</p>
      <p>The man reported the suspicious object to Israel Police and a sapper team arrived at the site</p>
      <p>The object was revealed to be a balloon carrying an illegal weapon. The balloon, likely sent from Gaza, had fallen to the ground without detonating.</p>
      <p>Police closed the area to civilians, and the sappers began destroying the explosives. No one was injured.</p>
      <p>"Especially now, and in general throughout the year, the public's awareness of suspicious objects is extremely important and prevents harm to human lives," a police spokesperson said.</p>
      <p>"In every situation when a suspicious object is located, regardless of what it looks like - a balloon, a kite, or something else - you should immediately call the police and distance curious onlookers from the site until the police arrive."</p>
