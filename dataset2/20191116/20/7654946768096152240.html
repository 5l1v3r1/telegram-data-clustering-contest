      <h1>Kanye West’s Sunday Service teams with Joel Osteen’s megachurch</h1>

      <p>Christianity will get a star-powered boost from two of the religion’s most famous disciples — when Kanye West’s Sunday Service comes to Joel Osteen’s Lakewood Church.</p>
      <p>Osteen will interview the rapper-turned-evangelist Sunday at his 17,000-seat megachurch in Houston, a church representative <a href="https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Kanye-West-at-Joel-Osteen-s-Lakewood-Church-Housto-14828487.php">told the Houston Chronicle.</a></p>
      <p>The interview will air live on Sirius XM at 11 a.m. West will return at 7 p.m. for a performance with his gospel choir.</p>
      <p>The rapper began dabbling in the religious arena earlier this year with his pop-up choir performances. The “Sunday Services” feature only music, and no preaching, but have a “Christian vibe,” West’s wife, Kim Kardashian, <a href="https://www.elle.com/fashion/celebrity-style/a27025445/kim-kardashian-interview-caroline-lemke-sunglasses/">said in an April interview with Elle magazine. </a></p>
      <p>West is currently promoting his new album, “Jesus is King.”</p>
      <p>The flamboyant televangelist is expected to ask him about his “journey to his faith” in the 15-20 minute Q&amp;A, Lakewood representative Donald Iloff told the Chronicle.</p>
      <p>“Kanye and Joel are friends,” Iloff said. “He’s been wanting to come out for some time and it just worked out for this weekend.”</p>
