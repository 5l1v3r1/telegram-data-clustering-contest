      <h2>Strictly Come Dancing viewers were left bitterly disappointed when Karim's stunning performance missed out on getting a 40</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T20:43:56+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 20:43</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Strictly Come Dancing viewers were utterly furious this evening over Craig Revel Horwood's score for Karim Zeroual's Charleston.</p>
      <p>The other judges were on their feet after Karim and Amy Dowden's performance, with Motsi Mabuse even revealing that she would be scoring them 10 before it was officially confirmed.</p>
      <p>However viewers were left bitterly disappointed when Karim's stunning performance missed out on getting a 40 after being scored nine by Craig.</p>
      <p>Motsi waved her own 10 paddle in front of Craig's and the pair scored '39'.</p>
      <p>But angry fans flocked to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> in fury over Craig's score.</p>

      <p>His partner Katya Jones told him after they were voted out: "Honestly I’m so proud of him and I think after even this dance which I think was your best dance you can leave with your head held up honestly; and in my eyes you’re the winner. The only thing he has lost is weight.</p>
      <p>"He came in every single day giving his heart, soul, everything, 200% no matter what after every single dance off and thank you so much. I’m so sorry I couldn’t take to Blackpool."</p>
