      <p>It's been 22 years since the world watched Rose survive the Titanic by holing up on a floating door. But our hearts have gone on for Jack, who surely could have lived, too, if Rose had just scooted over.</p>
      <p>"Jack could have fit on that door" truthers on the internet still regularly bang the drum that a near-death Rose could have saved her steerage-class lover if she'd just made a little room on her makeshift floatation device, a door.</p>
      <p>Now, Céline Dion, the woman who gave voice to the <i>Titanic </i>theme song "My Heart Will Go On," is joining the fray.</p>
      <p>Looking fab in a poofy one-shouldered gold lamé situation, Dion delivers a feminist close reading of a still from the movie that depicts Rose on the door and Jack floating in freezing water. </p>
      <p>"He doesn't need an invitation," Dion says, looking coldly to camera. "Come on, baby."</p>
      <p>Watch the whole video for her full read of the situation. Finally, the queen has spoken. </p>
