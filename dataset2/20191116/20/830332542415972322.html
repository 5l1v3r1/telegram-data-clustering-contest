      <p>LINCOLN, Neb. - Wisconsin's Big Ten West title hopes are slim after dropping back-to-back road games at Illinois and Ohio State, but things are looking a bit different Saturday in Lincoln.</p>
      <p>After a half of big plays, the No. 14 Badgers lead the Cornhuskers, 27-14. </p>
      <p>Despite turning the ball over and falling behind 7-0, Wisconsin (7-2) found its groove on Aron Cruickshank's 89-yard kickoff return for a score. That's when the Badgers' offense took with a field goal, A.J. Taylor's 55-yard touchdown reception, an interception and a short-field score for Jonathan Taylor. </p>
      <p>But it was the Badgers team we've become familiar with that ended the half-ended the half on a four-minute ground-and-pound scoring drive and a field goal. </p>
      <p>Nebraska (4-5) has struggled all season and is looking for its first bowl in a couple of years, but extended head coach Scott Frost on Saturday morning before the game, despite starting his coaching career in Lincoln 8-13. </p>
      <p>Wisconsin returns home next Saturday to Camp Randall for Senior Day against Purdue. </p>
      <p>If Minnesota loses to Iowa later this afternoon and Wisconsin wins out (vs. Purdue, at Minnesota), the Badgers represent the division in next month's Big Ten Championship Game. </p>
