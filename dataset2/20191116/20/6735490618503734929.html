      <p>In the first intermission to air on Hockey Night in Canada without <a href="https://globalnews.ca/tag/don-cherry">Don Cherry</a> at his side, host Ron MacLean addressed viewers alone for almost five minutes, saying, “we are all hurting.”</p>
      <p>“I have collapsed a hundred times this week if not more,” he said. “We’re all disappointed.”</p>
      <p>MacLean says he has spent time “reflecting.”</p>
      <p>“I’ve sat all week long reflecting, listening to you, and I’ve heard you — I mean you the viewer,” he said.</p>

      <p>Before the hockey game kicked off, MacLean told viewers he planned to address his 85-year-old former co-host’s dismissal during the first intermission.</p>
      <p>MacLean opened Saturday’s show by saying there were “obviously mixed emotions” ahead of the broadcast, calling it “the end of an era.”</p>
      <p>The first intermission featured the 2019 Hockey Hall of Fame inductees, who are set for a Monday induction ceremony.</p>
      <p>On Friday, Sportsnet said it is considering new directions for the long-running segment.</p>
      <p>“We’re taking the time to explore new formats for the first intermission,” Sportsnet communications director Andrew Garas told The Canadian Press.</p>
      <p>Cherry was fired from his job on Monday after his Nov. 9 Coach’s Corner segment, in which he appeared to say newcomers to Canada don’t wear poppies, implying they don’t support veterans.</p>

      <p>“You people … you love our way of life, you love our milk and honey, at least you can pay a couple bucks for a poppy or something like that,” Cherry said in the televised segment.</p>
      <p>“These guys paid for your way of life that you enjoy in Canada, these guys paid the biggest price.”</p>
      <p>Sportsnet said he “made divisive remarks that do not represent our values or what we stand for.”</p>
      <p>In an interview earlier this week, Cherry didn’t apologize for his comments but said he would <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/6160099/don-cherry-defends-comments-hockey-night-in-canada/">have chosen different words</a> if he could do it again.</p>
      <p>MacLean issued an <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/6151647/don-cherry-immigrants-poppies/">apology </a>the day after Cherry’s comments, saying he wished he had handled it differently.</p>

      <p>Earlier on Saturday, Cherry addressed the events of the past week by thanking his supporters.</p>
      <p>“Again, I want to thank everyone who has called emailed, dropped by the house this past week. It will take weeks to personally get back to everyone, so I am again, thanking you all now,” he tweeted.</p>
