        <b>As in the rest of the country, also in this eastern Cuban province, the change of the PIN of the magnetic cards associated with accounts in the national banking system has begun. The gradual process seeks to streamline payments through POS terminals in the commercial network and strengthen the security of these operations.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Las Tunas, Cuba.– Gradually, when the holders of the cards associated with the banks of Credit and Commerce (BANDEC), Popular Savings (BPA) and Metropolitan, go to an ATM to carry out an operation, the system itself will request the change of PIN. Although, if the holders prefer so, they will be able to keep the current key.</p>
      <p>This change is necessary due to the installation of a new platform for the POS network; so that people only have to use their PIN as a means of authentication when paying and not to sign a document as is currently done.</p>
      <p>Yuslaidys Avila Puig, a specialist in Electronic Banking at the Bank of Credit and Commerce in Las Tunas, stressed that this novelty "will minimize the time spent on each operation by eliminating the cumbersome process of entering the cardholder's data in each transaction and improvements in security. Thus, the customers themselves will enter their PIN to carry out the operation."</p>
      <p>The use of the PIN together with an identity document is the most widely used international way to authenticate that who presents a magnetic card to make a purchase is its legal holder.</p>

        <b>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>In my municipality there are no ATMs, how do I change the PIN, is there an option in Transfermovil or on the web?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The PIN change will be a gradual process, which will be requested from customers through ATMs, so far this is the only option that offers the necessary security for this process; others are evaluated for the future.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What happens if I do not change my password on November 13?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Nothing will happen, in fact, the PIN change will not start on the 13th for all cards. It will be a gradual process, and just wait until the time comes to enable the change for your card. You will know this when you operate in the ATM and the blue screen of this publication is shown.</p>
      <p>
        <b>If I do not change my PIN, can I continue to make transactions at the ATM?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes, you can continue operating at the ATM and in the rest of the electronic payment channels. Once the screen inviting you to change the PIN at the ATM is displayed, you can make the change at that time or later, however, we recommend that you make the PIN change from the first time, to avoid displaying the screen each time you operate at the ATM. We remind you that this is a one-time process.</p>
      <p>
        <b>After the screen is displayed and I change the password, can I change my password again later if I wish?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes, you can change your password in the ATM every time you consider it.</p>
      <p>
        <b>When will the password be used in payments at POS terminals? Will it be at all POS at once?</b>
      </p>
      <p>It will be in 2020, on a date yet to be determined, which will depend on the progress that exists in the change of the keys.</p>
      <p>It will not begin to be enabled in all the POS at the same time, it will be enabled gradually starting with the locations with ATMs installed, where people have been able to make the change of password, a process that will be continuously monitored so as not to affect the service.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Will I be able to pay with my card without having changed the password at the POS where the password begins to be used?</b>
      </p>
      <p>No, the change of password is implemented so that you can use the card in the POS that activates the use of the PIN in payments. The use of the password in payments by POS will be enabled gradually in the localities where the conditions are created so that people have been able to change their password.</p>
