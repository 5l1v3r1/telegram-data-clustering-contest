      <p>After a week long of test driving, we’re now ready to give our video review of the BMW Z4 M40i Roadster. The written review was published a while back, and <a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2019/11/01/test-drive-bmw-z4-m40i-the-most-fun-bmw-in-a-long-time/">you can catch it here</a>. Before we let you jump into the video, lets do a quick recap of the car tested as well as of the driving impressions.</p>
      <p>Powering the BMW Z4 M40i is a 3.0 liter turbocharged inline-six engine making 382 hp and 369 lb-ft of torque and I can honestly think of no better engine for it. In a car as small and light as the Z4, the B58 engine turns it into a hot-road. All of its torque comes on like a sledgehammer, from low in the rev range all the way until its peak horsepower kicks in at the top half of the tach. From there, it keeps pulling and the BMW Z4 M40i can get from 0-60 mph in a claimed 3.9 seconds.</p>

      <p>But what makes Bavaria’s hot-rod engine even more special in the BMW Z4 M40i than in, say, an M340i, is the noise. More specifically, the fact that you can hear the noise without the nuisance of a roof interfering with it. With the top down, you can hear the engine’s full song and it sounds incredible.</p>
      <p>As far as the driving experience on some twisty roads, the BMW Z4 M40i steers with real precision, thanks to extremely aggressive front-end grip and a quick steering rack. But because the chassis is also well balanced and the back end likes to play, it will change directions very quickly, almost too quickly. It’s not hard to get its tail to step out but, thankfully, it’s easy to control and even to hold.</p>
      <p>In the end, we concluded that the BMW Z4 M40i is is one of the most fun BMWs we’ve driven in a long time. More so than even than the BMW M2 Competition, a car that’s supposed to be the pure driver’s car of the Bavarian lineup.</p>
