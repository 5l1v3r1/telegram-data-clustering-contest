      <p>The leader of Sinn Fein says any possible government they form in the Republic of Ireland must prepare for an Irish unity referendum in the first five years.</p>
      <p>On Saturday night during her leader’s speech at the conclusion of the party’s two-day Ard Fheis in Londonderry, Mary Lou McDonald repeated the stance that Sinn Fein would be willing to form a government with either of the Irish majority parties Fianna Fail or Fine Gael, if they could deliver a republican programme for government in Dublin.</p>
      <p>“Let the other parties tell us if they are willing to implement a republican programme for government,” she said.</p>
      <p>“If we have the chance to deliver housing and healthcare, to stand up for people and deliver a fair deal for families, to deliver on Irish Unity.</p>
      <p>“Then that is the only basis on which Sinn Fein would enter government.”</p>

      <p>The Good Friday Agreement states that the Secretary of State should call a referendum “if at any time it appears likely to him that a majority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the United Kingdom and form part of a united Ireland”.</p>
      <p>If in government, Sinn Fein could only ask the Northern Ireland Secretary of State to call a referendum, but would have no power to do so from Dublin.</p>
      <p>Ms McDonald added that the referendum on a united Ireland was a simply a question of when.</p>
      <p>“The Irish government and all who say that now is not the time to speak of unity are wrong,” she said.</p>
      <p>“Brexit has changed everything. Many people, for the first time, are now considering their future in a United Ireland.</p>
      <p>“A referendum on unity will happen, as set-out in the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
      <p>“It is not a question of if, but a question of when.</p>
      <p>“The referendum must happen in the next five years, let the people have their say.”</p>
      <p>On the current stalemate at Stormont, which has left Northern Ireland without a government for more than 1,000 days, Ms McDonald says her party stands ready to get back around the table with the DUP.</p>
      <p>“There is no contradiction between working for Irish Unity and seeking the restoration of the northern institutions,” she said.</p>
      <p>“Sinn Fein has never been the obstacle to powersharing or good government or doing a deal.</p>
      <p>“Three years on, we have no assembly and executive. This is unsustainable.</p>
      <p>“There is an immediate challenge to restore government in the North.</p>
      <p>“To bring accountable government for all the people.</p>
      <p>“Government of respect and equality leaving discrimination and exclusion to the past.</p>
      <p>“We are ready to do business.</p>
      <p>“I challenge the DUP and both governments to step forward. To resolve the issues and get government back in action.</p>
      <p>“We don’t need a drawn-out talks process. The issues have been well-rehearsed.</p>
      <p>“We need a good faith, purposeful engagement by political Unionism.</p>
      <p>“Sinn Fein negotiators stand ready.”</p>
      <p>The speech also outlined party manifesto items including a massive public housing programme, the introduction of a living wage and major cuts to the cost of childcare.</p>
      <p>“You are entitled to a good life, a full life that you can afford,” Ms McDonald told over 2,000 attending delegates.</p>
      <p>“Fine Gael and Fianna Fail have short-changed you.</p>
      <p>“If we are serious about solving the housing crisis we need to get back to public house building led by councils and increasing the supply of affordable homes.</p>
      <p>“This is something that will never be delivered by Fianna Fail or Fine Gael because their policies are about developers and landlords making profits.</p>
      <p>“My commitment to you is that Sinn Fein will deliver the largest public house building programme that Ireland has ever seen.”</p>
      <p>The party have also committed to a rent reduction by up to 1,500 euro a year through a tax relief and a three-year rent freeze, in order to tackle the ongoing housing crisis in the republic of Ireland.</p>
      <p>The party conference also had a concentration on the climate emergency, which Ms McDonald says a Green New Deal, like the policy currently being debated in the US, could be implemented in Ireland.</p>
      <p>“A Green New Deal for Ireland means zero emissions targets; a just transition, sustainable jobs; state investment in infrastructure and skills,” she said.</p>
      <p>In the coming weeks, the party plan to publish radical proposals from David Cullinane TD and Caoimhe Archibald MLA.</p>
