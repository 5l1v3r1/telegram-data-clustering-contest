      <h1>MI5 to recruit 'working class spies' in a black and ethnic minority diversity drive</h1>
      <h2>Called the Summer Diversity Intelligence Internship it is aimed at black and ethnic minority recruits who are 'full of enthusiasm, with a sense of team spirit and a passion for learning'</h2>

      <p>James Bond prefers an Aston Martin – but today’s spy chiefs are after ­candidates with Ford Fiestas.</p>
      <p>MI5 has launched a recruitment programme to lure interns from a wider social background.</p>
      <p>The posts are aimed at ethnic minority applicants from working class families.</p>
      <p>They must be problem solvers full of enthusiasm, with a sense of team spirit and a passion for learning, who are determined to make a positive impact, says the advert.</p>
      <p>Candidates are warned not to discuss their application for the £24,717-a-year post with anyone other than a close family member.</p>
      <p>Director general Andrew Parker said: “Keeping the country safe is a challenge that requires the best efforts of the richest mix of the most talented people.</p>

      <p>"So it is essential that ours is an inclusive workplace offering rewarding careers for all.”</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the Social Mobility Foundation charity named MI6 one of the top 75 UK employers for promoting social mobility.</p>
      <p>Charity boss David Johnston said: “They are very aware of the stereotype – you go to Eton, Oxford and then you become James Bond.</p>
      <p>“They also realise that there’s an awful lot of talent in the country that would not even consider working for them or think that they would be suitable candidates.”</p>
      <p>MI6 – which was bombarded with interest from working class applicants after last year’s Salisbury poison attack – is looking to appoint 800 new staff over two years.</p>
