      <h1>Snooker legend Willie Thorne has house repossessed in fresh heartache after marital split</h1>

      <p>Snooker star Willie Thorne has suffered fresh heartache after his marital split – his house has been repossessed.</p>
      <p>The star, who has been plagued by gambling problems down the years, lost the mock Tudor detached home after reports the mortgage had not been paid.</p>
      <p>The revelation comes just days after it emerged that troubled Willie, 65, had split from former Miss Great Britain Jill Saxby, his wife of 24 years.</p>
      <p>A source close to Willie told the Sunday Mirror: “He’s really struggling. To lose your wife and house is just awful. It’s been a rotten time.”</p>
      <p>Willie’s home in the picturesque Leicestershire village of Broughton Astley had fallen into disrepair while he and Jill were living in Spain.</p>

      <p>Now it is set to sell for £475,000, according to local estate agents.</p>
      <p>One told us: “The owner hasn’t paid the mortgage so the bank repossessed the property.”</p>
      <p>When approached by the Sunday Mirror, Willie did not want to comment. But he published a hastily-deleted web message which read: “Just so everybody knows and before rumours start, Jill and I have separated and she has gone back to the UK. I hope to be staying here in Spain.”</p>

      <p>Four years ago, Willie told how his gambling addiction had brought him to the brink of suicide in a hotel room – but he was saved by Jill. Speaking about his gambling habit earlier this year, Willie said: “I probably borrowed £1million over the years in order to gamble and I am still in debt from it all.</p>
      <p>“When I look back it upsets me. I do not think I have made many good money decisions.</p>
      <p>“The last three years have been a struggle, so I am trying my hardest to get work and get back on my feet.”</p>
      <p>Willie, who was declared bankrupt in 2015, has also told how money lenders threatened to chop off his wife’s fingers and take her jewellery.</p>

      <p>The dad-of-three’s fortunes have dipped dramatically since his playing career ended. Back in snooker’s 1980s heyday, Willie and stars such as Steve Davis, Alex Higgins and Dennis Taylor were pulling in TV audiences of up to 19 million. He was dubbed The Maximum Man for making more 147 breaks in practice than any of the <br/>other players.</p>
      <p>He was national under-16 champion in 1970 and twice reached the quarter-finals of the World Snooker Championship. He won the Classic in 1985, and after quitting in the mid-1990s became a BBC pundit for 20 years.</p>
