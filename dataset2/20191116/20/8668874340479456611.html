      <p>Munster opened their Heineken Champions Cup campaign with a 32-13 bonus point victory over <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/ospreys">Ospreys</a> at the Liberty Stadium.</p>
      <p>Tries from <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/munster/players/jeremy-loughman/">Jeremy Loughman</a>, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/ireland/players/keith-earls/">Keith Earls</a>, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/ireland/players/andrew-conway/">Andrew Conway</a>, and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/munster/players/james-cronin/">James Cronin</a>, along with 12 points from the boot of <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/munster/players/tyler-bleyendaal/">Tyler Bleyendaal</a> was enough to get <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/munster">Munster</a> over the line.</p>
      <p>All the Ospreys could muster was a late try from <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/ospreys/players/aled-davies/">Aled Davies</a>, with <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/ospreys/players/luke-price/">Luke Price</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/ospreys/players/james-hook/">James Hook</a> kicking eight points between them.</p>

      <p>Price opened the scoring with a successful penalty attempt after Munster were penalised at the scrum. But Munster began to build some pressure with and very nearly scored when Bleyendaal worked an overlap only, for <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/munster/players/mike-haley/">Mike Haley</a> to knock the ball forward with nobody in front of him.</p>
      <p>But Bleyendaal kicked Munster ahead as the Ospreys were forced to make a lot of tackles. Price levelled the scores but Munster finally turned pressure into points with Loughman powering his way over from short range.</p>
      <p>The try wasn’t initially awarded with television replays showing <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/ireland/players/conor-murray/">Conor Murray</a> may have spilled the ball forward. But the television footage proved inconclusive and the try stood. Bleyendaal converted to give the visitors a 13-6 lead at half-time.</p>
      <p>Munster carried on from where they left off in the early stages of the second-half with the Ospreys forwards unable to match the home sides dynamic ball carriers.</p>
      <p>The visiting forwards went through the phases before the ball was spun wide for Earls to sneak in at the corner.</p>
      <p>Earls try was referred to the television match official due to Hanno Dirksen’s brave tackle but the replays proved the wingers’ foot had not been in touch.</p>
      <p>Ospreys hooker <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/ospreys/players/scott-otten/">Scott Otten</a> cheaply surrendered possession from the restart which put the result beyond the hosts. The ball fell into the hands of Loughman who put Conway into the clear with the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/ireland">Ireland</a> international running in unopposed from 55 metres out.</p>
      <p>Bleyendaal was successful with the conversion and Munster went in search of a try-scoring bonus point. But to their immense credit, the Ospreys refused to throw in the towel with <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/wales">Wales</a> internationals <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/wales/players/nicky-smith/">Nicky Smith</a>, Aled Davies, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/ospreys/players/bradley-davies/">Bradley Davies</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/ospreys/players/adam-beard/">Adam Beard</a> a welcome sight from the replacements bench.</p>
      <p>And Davies grabbed a late consolation try for the hosts as Munster were caught napping when he took a quickly tapped penalty. Former British and Irish <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/lions">Lions</a> utility back Hook converted but Munster finished the game by laying siege to the Ospreys line.</p>
      <p>The Irish province were awarded a penalty and went for the corner. In what was the last play of the match, Cronin powered his way over the line off the back of a driving lineout to secure all five points for the visitors.</p>
