      <p>Samuel McCullum, 57, was found <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/felon-gets-life-sentences-dekalb-after-dna-helps-tie-him-cold-cases/y0mkBkCw4zjsaDhU5fdpWN/#">guilty</a> of murder, two counts of felony murder and two counts of rape in two separate DeKalb County cases, District Attorney’s Office spokeswoman Yvette Jones said in a news release. s</p>
      <p>McCullum was connected to the cases when his DNA was entered into the criminal database after he raped a 17-year-old girl in Kentucky. He was convicted in 2002 of sodomy and false imprisonment in that case, the news release <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/felon-gets-life-sentences-dekalb-after-dna-helps-tie-him-cold-cases/y0mkBkCw4zjsaDhU5fdpWN/#">said</a>.  </p>
      <p>Four years earlier, McCullum sexually assaulted 38-year-old Monica Blackwell on Porter Road in DeKalb before killing her, Jones said. The woman was only partially clothed and had suffered from blunt force trauma to the head.</p>
      <p>Then, the case went cold. </p>
      <p>In May 1999, McCullum offered a ride to a 21-year-old woman walking on Lawrenceville Highway, the news release said. He took her to a car shop where he worked and raped her three times. </p>
      <p>The victim then convinced McCullum to take her to her nearby apartment. When she got home, she immediately told her roommate, who convinced her to call police, Jones said. </p>
      <p>A rape kit was performed, but that case also went cold because the victim relocated out of fear, according to the news release. </p>
      <p>In 2017, authorities were able to extradite McCullum to DeKalb after he finished serving his Kentucky sentence, the news release said. </p>
      <p>His past convictions include sexual assaults in New Jersey in 1983 and in North Carolina in 1995. McCullum also faces charges in Fulton County in connection with a 1998 murder and rape, Jones <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/felon-gets-life-sentences-dekalb-after-dna-helps-tie-him-cold-cases/y0mkBkCw4zjsaDhU5fdpWN/#">said</a>. </p>
