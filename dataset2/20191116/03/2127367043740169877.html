      <h1>Rafael Nadal Bows Out Of ATP Finals After Alexander Zverev Beats Daniil Medvedev</h1>
      <h2>Rafael Nadal exited the ATP Finals but ended his season as the world number one and with a chance to lead Spain to Davis Cup glory.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T03:31:58+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 03:31</time> by <a rel="author">Agence France-Presse</a></address>
      <p>Rafael Nadal was unable to crown his season with a first <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/tennis/atp-finals-matteo-berrettini-makes-history-with-consolation-win-in-london-2132707">ATP Finals</a> title but he ends it as world number one and with a chance to lead Spain to Davis Cup glory. The Spaniard, who came to London under an injury cloud, had a terrible start to his week at the O2 Arena, crushed in straight sets by defending champion Alexander Zverev in his first round-robin match. But he produced a performance of <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/tennis/atp-finals-rafael-nadal-beats-daniil-medvedev-to-keep-dream-alive-2132098">astonishing grit to recover from 1-5 and match point down against Daniil Medvedev</a> and saw off Stefanos Tsitsipas in three sets on Friday. It was not quite enough to reach the semi-finals but Nadal leaves London after securing the year-end number one ranking for a fifth time, pulling level with Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic.</p>
      <p><a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/tennis/atp-finals-rafael-nadal-sweats-on-semis-spot-after-beating-stefanos-tsitsipas-2133305">Nadal was in the strange position after his win against 21-year-old Tsitsipas</a> of not knowing whether he would be heading home or playing Federer in the knockouts.</p>
      <p>Later, Zverev's win against Medvedev confirmed his tournament was over.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old, who was presented with the trophy for securing the number spot on court, said it was difficult to compare the achievement with winning a Grand Slam.</p>
      <p>Nadal is now on 19 majors, just one behind Federer after winning his 12th French Open this year and his fourth US Open crown.</p>
      <p>"I know it is something so important because to achieve this you have to play well for 11 months," he said.</p>
      <p>"To win a Grand Slam you have to play well two weeks. But it's difficult to compare. For me personally, when you win a Grand Slam, you win a Grand Slam winning the last point, and that feeling you, can't have it here. That's the big difference."</p>
      <p>But he said finishing on top of the world was a great achievement after his struggles with injuries earlier in the season.</p>
      <p>And he was delighted to pull level on five year-end finishes with <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/tennis/atp-finals-roger-federer-outclasses-novak-djokovic-to-reach-semis-2132796">Djokovic and Federer</a> -- the other two members of the "Big Three".</p>
      <p>
        <b>Grand Slam glory</b>
      </p>
      <p>Nadal can look back on another staggering year in which he has shown remarkable consistency, winning four trophies including two Masters titles.</p>
      <p>He reached the semi-finals at all four Grand Slams in a season for just the second time in his illustrious career.</p>
      <p>But it did not start too promisingly for the veteran, who was plagued by injuries early in the season, including a thigh strain and right knee injury.</p>
      <p>The injury jinx struck again late on, forcing him to miss October's Shanghai Masters with a wrist injury and his participation at the ATP Finals was in doubt after he withdrew from the Paris Masters at the semi-final stage with an abdominal strain.</p>
      <p>But now the dust has settled, Nadal can look back on another staggering season in which he overtook Djokovic in the final stretch to top the rankings.</p>
      <p>"My decision or our decision is to try to do the things to play as long as possible, so that's why I tried to do the conservative calendar in terms of saving the body and everything," said Nadal.</p>
      <p>"But the thing is when I have been playing, I have been playing very well. I achieved almost every single time the last rounds of every tournament.</p>
      <p>"So that's why I'm put in a position that I am where I am today, having this trophy with me."</p>
      <p>And it is not over yet for the Spaniard.</p>
      <p>Nadal has the chance to lead Spain to glory in the new-look Davis Cup in Madrid next week and he is raring to go.</p>
      <p>Changes to the tournament's format mean 18 teams will be vying for the title over the course of a week.</p>
      <p>"Let's see how the thing works," he said. "I am sure that they did great and it is going to be something really special. And playing at home even more.</p>
      <p>"So excited about it. I really hope that the team is working the right way during these previous days of the tournament, so I really expect to find a team very well-prepared when I arrive there."</p>
