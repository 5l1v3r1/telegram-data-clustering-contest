      <p><b>MINNEAPOLIS —</b> <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nba/bradley-beal-player-stats">Bradley Beal</a> scored 44 points for the second straight game and the <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nba/washington-wizards-team">Washington Wizards</a> snapped a three-game losing streak with a 137-116 win over the short-handed <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nba/minnesota-timberwolves-team">Minnesota Timberwolves</a> on Friday night.</p>
      <p>It was the third 40-point game of the season for Beal, who has topped 30 five times in his last seven games. His 44 points came on 15-of-22 shooting.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nba/moritz-wagner-player-stats">Moritz Wagner</a> came off the bench for Washington to add 30 points and 15 rebounds — both career highs. Wagner also drew three charges to help spark the Wizards’ defense in the first half.</p>
      <p>Washington dominated Minnesota down low all night. The Wizards scored 76 points in the paint, a season high.</p>
      <p>Minnesota big man <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nba/karl-anthony-towns-player-stats">Karl-Anthony Towns</a>, celebrating his 24th birthday, led the Timberwolves with 36 points. Towns, who missed the first meeting with Washington this season while serving a two-game suspension, scored 19 in the second quarter.</p>
      <p>The Timberwolves were without leading scorer <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nba/andrew-wiggins-player-stats">Andrew Wiggins</a>, who missed the game due to personal reasons. Wiggins was averaging a team-high 25.9 points through the first 11 games of the season.</p>
      <p>Wiggins had been especially effective over his last six games, in which he averaged 31.6 points.</p>
      <p>Washington led by 12 in the first half and took a 13-point lead early in the fourth quarter on a 3-pointer by Wagner.</p>
      <p>As the Timberwolves adjusted their lineup in Wiggins’ absence, point guard <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nba/jeff-teague-player-stats">Jeff Teague</a> stepped back into the starting five after coming off the bench Wednesday against San Antonio. He had 13 points and 11 assists.</p>
      <p>
        <b>TIP-INS</b>
      </p>
      <p>Wizards: Entered with the third-worst scoring defense in the NBA, allowing 120 points per game. … The Wizards scored 27 points off 20 Minnesota turnovers, a season high. … Washington’s 38 assists marked a season high.</p>
      <p>Timberwolves: Head coach Ryan Saunders didn’t know if Wiggins would be available Saturday against Houston. “I don’t comment necessarily on personal matters,” Saunders said. “But one thing I will say is family is family, and we are family. Andrew has the time that he needs to deal with any personal matters.” … Minnesota transferred two-way player <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nba/kelan-martin-player-stats">Kelan Martin</a> to the roster. Martin entered late in the first quarter, his second appearance with the Timberwolves this season. … The Wolves were 11 for 37 from 3-point range.</p>
