      <h1>Rasheem Dunn’s debut could give St. John’s what it’s missing</h1>

      <p>St. John’s was in the middle of watching film on Wednesday afternoon when the room exploded.</p>
      <p>No, this wasn’t new coach Mike Anderson ripping into one of his players. It was the Johnnies joyously celebrating with teammate Rasheem Dunn when he broke the good news that the NCAA had <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/13/ncaa-grants-st-johns-rasheem-dunn-eligibility-waiver/">granted him his legislative relief waiver</a>, making the Cleveland State transfer eligible effective immediately.</p>
      <p>“After that we couldn’t continue watching film,” junior forward LJ Figueroa recalled. “Everybody was so excited.”</p>
      <p>The timing couldn’t be better, as St. John’s prepares for its first legit test of the season, against American East favorite Vermont on Saturday afternoon in Queens (4 p.m., FS2, WMCA 570 AM). The Red Storm (3-0) have been impressive through three games, winning by an average of 24.3 points per game. But the Catamounts present a significant step up in class, a mid-major power that reached the NCAA Tournament a year ago and returns three starters, including reigning conference Player of the Year Anthony Lamb.</p>
      <p>“We’re going to have to play well, we’re going to have to defend, going to have to be able to score, make Lamb work for what he gets,” Anderson said.</p>
      <p>Dunn, a Brooklyn native and high school teammate of former St. John’s star Shamorie Ponds, is expected to come off the bench, but he will play significant minutes. He averaged 15.4 points per game two years ago at St. Francis Brooklyn, before transferring to Cleveland State and sitting out last season. The 6-foot-2 guard projects as the third scorer Anderson’s team needed, after All-Big East preseason second team selections Figueroa and Mustapha Heron. Figueroa and Heron are each averaging 20 points per game so far, while the next highest scorer is reserve Marcellus Earlington at 10 points per contest.</p>
      <p>“He’s going to impact our team, in terms of how we play, add more depth, add more toughness, add another guy that’s capable of scoring and scoring at a pretty good clip,” Anderson said of Dunn. “It’s not necessarily just contributing scoring. I think he can make other people better. He can cause some havoc defensively.”</p>
      <p>“People are going to key in on Mustapha, they’re going to key in on LJ. With the floor spaced out, you have to have people who can break down people and be able to create.”</p>
      <p>There is bound to be rust. Dunn last played a game on Feb. 28, 2018. He wasn’t able to take part in the Red Storm’s closed-door scrimmage against Temple or their exhibition against Queens College. But the hope is once Dunn finds his rhythm, he will be a difference-maker, a combo guard capable of playing on or off the ball, scoring and creating opportunities for others, another valuable defender in the Johnnies’ up-tempo pressing style.</p>
      <p>“’Rah’ is definitely a big piece to our team,” Figueroa said. “I think he’s going to help us out tremendously, just another experienced player we definitely need on our roster. [He] 100 percent makes us a better team.”</p>
