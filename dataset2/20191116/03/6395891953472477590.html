      <p><b>CLEVELANDÂ (AP)</b> - A person familiar with the injury says Cleveland Browns starting safety Morgan Burnett is done for the season with a torn Achilles tendon.</p>
      <p>Burnett got hurt in the first half of Thursday's 21-7 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers, one of his former teams. Tests taken Friday revealed the season-ending injury, said the person who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the team has not provided an update on his condition.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old Burnett, who signed with Cleveland in April as a free agent, had an interception in the victory. The Steelers waived him in April. He also played eight seasons in Green Bay.</p>
      <p>Burnett's injury is another shot to the Browns' defense and thin secondary. Safety Eric Murray has been out with a knee injury.</p>
      <p>Cleveland also lost star defensive end Myles Garrett, who was suspended indefinitely by the NFL after he swung a helmet and struck Pittsburgh quarterback Mason Rudolph in the head.</p>
