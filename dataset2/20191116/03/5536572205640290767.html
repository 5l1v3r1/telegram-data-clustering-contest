      <p>Dak Prescott likely never knew his pregame ritual that he does before every game would turn into the new thing to do, but here we are…</p>
      <p>The hip thrusting he displayed on Sunday Night Football before the game against the Minnesota Vikings has now made its way to the NBA.</p>
      <p>On Friday night, Charlotte Hornets player Devonte Graham was spotted on the court mocking the Dallas Cowboys QB with some hip thrusting of his own.</p>
