      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T03:52:26+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 03:52</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Michael Schumacher's wife Corinna has hit back at his former manager's claims that she is hiding the truth about the Formula One legend's condition.</p>
      <p>Seven-times F1 champion <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/michael-schumacher">Schumacher</a> suffered a serious brain injury in December 2013 in a skiing accident in the French Alps, which left him in a coma.</p>
      <p>Little has since been revealed about Schumacher's condition of the seven-time world champion since he moved to being treated at his family's Lake Geneva home in September 2014.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Willi Weber, his long-term manager, said he believed Corinna Schumacher <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/formula-1/michael-schumachers-ex-manager-claims-20865470">feared the truth about Schumacher’s condition entering the public domain</a> . He claimed she had knocked back several requests by him to see the former Ferrari driver.</p>
      <p>But now Corinna has hit back at Weber in a rare interview, saying 50-year-old Schumacher was "in the very best of hands" and she was following his wishes by keeping details of his condition under wraps.</p>

      <p>"He is in the best of hands right now and we are doing everything we can to help him," she said to <a href="https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/mercedes-me/inspiration/she/">She's Mercedes</a> magazine.</p>
      <p>"Try to understand that we follow Michael's desire to keep his health a secret.</p>
      <p>"You can be sure that he is in the very best of hands and that we are doing everything humanly possible to help him.</p>
      <p>"Please understand if we are following Michael's wishes and keeping such a sensitive subject as health, as it has always been, in privacy."</p>

      <p>Weber spoke out earlier this month in German TV documentary <i>The Michael Schumacher Tale.</i></p>
      <p>He said: "I know that Michael has been hit hard, but unfortunately I do not know what progress he makes <i>.</i></p>
      <p>"I’d like to know how he’s doing and shake hands or stroke his face.</p>
      <p>"But unfortunately, this is rejected by Corinna. She’s probably afraid that I’ll see right away what’s going on and make the truth public.</p>
      <p>"I firmly believe in Michael’s recovery, because I know he is a fighter. If there is a chance, he will use it. That cannot be the end.</p>
      <p>"I pray for him and am convinced that we will see him again."</p>
      <p>Schumacher's seven F1 crowns included five in a row between 2000 and 2004, after he also won back-to-back titles in 194 and 1995.</p>
      <p>Lewis Hamilton is one behind Schumacher's record after clinching the 2019 title earlier this month.</p>
