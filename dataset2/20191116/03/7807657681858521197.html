      <p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/Golden-Joystick-awards-2019-winners/">The Golden Joystick Awards</a> take place every year and they're voted on by the public. This year, some more winners were crowned for 2019. Two Microsoft games, Gears 5 and <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/minecraft">Minecraft</a>, won the Xbox Game of the Year accolade and the Still Playing Award. As you probably surmised, Gears 5 won the Xbox Game of the Year since it was a new release, and Minecraft bagged the Still Playing Award because it has hundreds of millions of players.</p>
      <p>Gears 5 is a third-person shooter that features a lengthy campaign and strong multiplayer modes. It garnered great reviews at launch, and the fact that it features some open areas with lots of exploration doesn't hurt the game either.</p>
      <p>Minecraft, as always, has received so many updates over the years that it keeps on attracting more players. It's great to see that it bagged the Still Playing Award because it has become an educational tool and much more in recent years.</p>
