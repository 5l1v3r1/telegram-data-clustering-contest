      <h1>Shooting at High School Football Game in New Jersey Leaves 3 Wounded</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T03:51:37+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 03:51</time> by <a rel="author">Neil Vigdor</a></address>
      <p>Five men were charged on Saturday in connection with a shooting at a high school football game in New Jersey on Friday night that injured three people, including a 10-year-old child, the authorities said.</p>
      <p>The shooting occurred at 8:29 p.m. in the third quarter of a playoff game at Pleasantville High School, which is just outside of Atlantic City and was hosting Camden High School.</p>
      <p>The sequence of events was <a href="https://twitter.com/6abcmike/status/1195523471721271297">captured on video by local news media</a> covering the game.</p>
      <p>“Unlike some of the shootings that have occurred on school premises throughout the country, this incident had nothing to do with the students of Pleasantville High School or Camden High School,” Damon G. Tyner, the Atlantic County prosecutor, <a href="https://www.acpo.org/5-men-apprehended-charged-in-connection-to-shooting-at-pleasantville-football-game/">said in a statement</a>. “The venue simply presented an opportunity for criminals to pursue their own form of petty vengeance against one another.”</p>
      <p>The authorities released no specific motive for the attack.</p>
      <p>One victim, a 27-year-old man, was in stable condition and will undergo surgery, officials said.</p>
      <p>At a news conference on Saturday, the police identified the adult victim as Ibn Abdullah. The gunman targeted Mr. Abdullah, who was in custody at the hospital after having been charged with an unlawful weapons offense, the police said. They did not specify if his charges were in connection to the shooting.</p>
      <p>The 10-year-old, who was also shot, was in critical condition. A third victim, a 15-year-old, was treated for a graze wound and released from a hospital.</p>
      <p>One of the five suspects, 31-year-old Alvin Wyatt, of Atlantic City, was charged with three counts of attempted murder, unlawful possession of a weapon and possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, the Atlantic County prosecutor’s office said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The other four men, Shahid Dixon, 27; Tyrell Dorn, 28; and Michael Mack, 27; all of Atlantic City, and Vance Golden, 26, of Pleasantville, were charged with unlawful possession of a weapon.</p>
      <p>“We are able to confirm that no Camden High students were injured or otherwise harmed during the incident,” Camden Schools <a href="https://twitter.com/CamdenSchools/status/1195536921881141248">said in a tweet</a> on Friday night.</p>
      <p>“A very special thank you to our coaches, faculty, and staff who were onsite and acted quickly to ensure the safety of all our students,” the school system <a href="https://twitter.com/CamdenSchools/status/1195536925383430146">said</a>. “Our thoughts and prayers are with the Pleasantville community in the wake of this unfortunate event.”</p>
      <p>The Pleasantville Schools superintendent did not immediately return a request for comment on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, a Democratic candidate for president, called the shooting “horrific” <a href="https://twitter.com/CoryBooker/status/1195731614464200704">on Twitter</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>“Praying for everyone at this high school football game in NJ last night &amp; the 2 people who were seriously injured by gunfire,” he said, adding the shooting was “not normal.”</p>
      <p>“When people are shot in church, schools, movie theaters &amp; football games we need to take action to change our gun laws,” he added.</p>
      <p>Aimee Ortiz and Derrick Bryson Taylor contributed reporting.</p>
