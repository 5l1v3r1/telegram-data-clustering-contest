      <p>One of the quickest ways frequent travelers can rack up bonus miles is by taking advantage of credit card sign-up bonus offers — an incentive that United Airlines has hiked on one of its co-branded cards recently as part of a limited-time offer. After making some major improvements to its <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/card-details/united-explorer-card/?utm_campaign=BGR_united_explorer&amp;utm_source=referral">United Explorer Card</a> over <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/news/united-new-explorer-credit-card/?utm_campaign=BGR_united_explorer&amp;utm_source=referral">the last year and a half</a>, the card is throwing in one more sweetener to tempt travelers with, one that will be on offer through January 9, 2020.</p>
      <p>The offer is an increased (and, we might add, a fairly generous) sign-up bonus of 65,000 miles which you will rack up after reaching two spending tiers with <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/card-details/united-explorer-card/?utm_campaign=BGR_united_explorer&amp;utm_source=referral">the card</a>.</p>
      <p>As we said, this is on the fairly decent side of the spectrum when it comes to offers of this kind from co-branded airline cards — the airline industry in general, of course, being known for many things but not necessarily its excess of giveaways for passengers. In terms of the <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/card-details/united-explorer-card/?utm_campaign=BGR_united_explorer&amp;utm_source=referral">United Explorer Card’s</a> temporarily expanded sign-up bonus (one of several nice offsets for the card’s $95 annual fee, waived the first year) here’s how you get it:</p>
      <p>New cardholders will need to reach two tiers of spending to earn the full offer of 65,000 miles. First, you’ll earn 40,000 United MileagePlus miles after you spend $2,000 on purchases within the first three months of card ownership. Then, you’ll earn another 25,000 United miles after you spend $10,000 total on purchases in the first six months.</p>

      <p>Before now, the sign-up bonus offer included 40,000 miles after new cardholders spent $2,000 within the first three months of card ownership, and then an additional 20,000 miles after spending $8,000 in the first six months. So, yes, with the new limited-time sign-up bonus offer, the spending requirement for the first six months is higher, but you’re rewarded for it (with an extra 5,000 bonus miles over the previous offer).</p>
      <h3>The final word</h3>
      <p>Beyond the sign-up bonus, other benefits of the <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/card-details/united-explorer-card/?utm_campaign=BGR_united_explorer&amp;utm_source=referral">United Explorer Card</a> to be aware of include the ability to get a <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/guide/how-to-avoid-checked-baggage-fees/?utm_campaign=BGR_united_explorer&amp;utm_source=referral">free checked bag</a> on United when you use <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/card-details/united-explorer-card/?utm_campaign=BGR_united_explorer&amp;utm_source=referral">this card</a> to buy your ticket, as well as priority boarding and two one-time United Club passes each year. Additionally, you can enjoy a 25% rebate on any in-flight purchases like food and Wi-Fi. The sign-up bonus offer of 65,000 miles will definitely make this a hard card to pass up for at least some frequent United Airlines fliers, but don’t forget — if you do want to grab <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/card-details/united-explorer-card/?utm_campaign=BGR_united_explorer&amp;utm_source=referral">this card</a> for those miles, make sure you act before the offer’s end date of January 9, 2020.</p>
