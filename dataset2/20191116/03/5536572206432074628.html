      <h1>Vontaze Burfict Calls Out Myles Garrett For His Behavior Against Steelers: ‘That’s Not Part of Football’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T03:56:27+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 03:56</time> by <a rel="author">Darrelle Lincoln</a></address>
      <p>When Myles Garrett ripped the helmet off of Mason Rudolph during Thursday Night Football, many people immediately started thinking of Vontaze Burfict and his name soon began trending online just because it was a dirty play and Vontaze is quite known for several of those.</p>
      <p>Burfict disagrees with those comparisons.</p>
      <p>The Suspended Raiders linebacker doesn’t want to hear any comparisons of himself to Myles Garrett hitting a player with a helmet and he made that clear when he spoke to The Athletic.</p>

      <blockquote>“Garrett, the Cleveland Browns defensive end, was suspended on Friday for the last six games of this season and perhaps beyond after striking Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph with Rudolph’s helmet Thursday night.<br/><br/>Burfict can relate on at least some level. He was suspended for final 12 games and any potential playoff games after a helmet-to-helmet hit on Colts tight end Jack Doyle on Sept. 29.<br/><br/>But there’s a key difference, he said.<br/><br/>“The NFL had to suspend somebody for that last night, since that wasn’t a football act,” Burfict said in a phone interview with The Athletic on Friday afternoon. “My suspension was a football act. I was hitting somebody. I wasn’t taking a helmet off and swinging it at somebody.”</blockquote>
      <p>Burfict also called out Garrett for his actions as he explained he had to turn the TV off because he didn’t want his daughters to see that fight.</p>
      <blockquote>“I don’t want them to see that,” Burfict said of his daughters in an exclusive interview with The Athletic. “Because that’s not what I do. That’s not part of football. I hit people on the field during the game. And they say that’s dirty, yeah, whatever. I get hit, too, during the games, so don’t complain. It’s football, bro.”</blockquote>
      <p>Neither Burfict nor Garrett will see the field again in 2019 due to their actions on the field.</p>
