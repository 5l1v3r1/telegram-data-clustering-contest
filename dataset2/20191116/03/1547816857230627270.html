        <b>Bigg Boss 13 has had its latest elimination and Salman Khan has announced that Rashami Desai's rumoured BF Arhaan Khan will be evicted from the controversial house. Exclusive update inside!</b>
      </p>
      <p>The journey of <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/bigg-boss-13-rashami-desai-s-rumoured-boyfriend-arhaan-khan-marks-his-grand-entry-on-salman-khan-s-show/5dbc3fb187fb571eff7e34b1">TV actor Arhaan Khan inside the Bigg Boss 13 house is over</a>. The actor who entered as a wild card contestant and was one of the most talked-about contestants ever since the season started will no longer be seen on the show. On the Sunday episode of Weekend ka Vaar, you will see Arhaan leave Rashami Desai and rest of the housemates shocked as he will be going back home due to less number of votes.Â <br/><br/>Arhaan was rumoured to have an affair with Rashami Desai. <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/bigg-boss-13-rashami-desai-s-alleged-bf-arhaan-khan-talks-about-their-marriage-rumours-and-her-journey-in-the-house/5daaf43a87fb571eff7e2b99">News reports also claimed that the two may even get married on the show but both the actors have been in a denial mode whenever asked</a>. However, with his entry fans were curious to see their relationship bloom but it didn't happen. <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/bigg-boss-13-rashami-desai-confesses-she-likes-arhaan-khan-reveals-she-is-planning-settle-in-matrimony-next-year/5dce3c4887fb571eff7e3e4e">Rashami was seen confessing her liking for him but he maintained to be a good friend</a>. And we think Bigg Boss and the audience were in no mood to give them more time to show their love story to the audience.</p>

      <p>Other than Rashami,<a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/bigg-boss-13-sidharth-shukla-blasts-rashami-desai-s-beau-arhaan-khan-says-main-kameena-aur-bekaar-hun/5dc176d787fb571eff7e3718"> we did see him coming out strongly and picking up fights with Sidharth Shukla and Asim Riaz but it seems that that was not enough to be in the game</a>. Though yesterday Rashami had been speaking about wanting to marry Arhaan and one of the BB cameras caught her say that.</p>
