        <b>After Argentina edged Brazil, Lionel Messi talked up the rivalry between the nations.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lionel Messi was delighted with Argentina’s win over Brazil, saying the rivalry between the South American nations was stronger than ever.</p>
      <p>On his international return, Messi scored the only goal of the game in Riyadh as Argentina recorded a 1-0 friendly win.</p>
      <p>The star tapped in a rebound after his penalty was saved by Alisson, while Gabriel Jesus earlier put a spot-kick wide for Brazil.</p>
      <p>The win over Brazil was Argentina’s first against their rivals since 2017 and Messi talked up the significance.</p>
      <p>“The rivalry is lived more than ever and it is always good to beat Brazil,” he said, via Ole.</p>
      <p>“When you win, you work better. The ideas of the coach are carried out on the pitch in another way and it is positive for what is coming.”</p>
