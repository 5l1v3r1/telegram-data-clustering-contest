      <p>INDORE: In contrast to his bold stroke-making in the Test arena these days, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Mayank-Agarwal">Mayank Agarwal</a> was quite the shy kid during his days as an under-19 cricketer for India. While he was an assured cricketer, he just wouldn't open up or communicate.</p>
      <p>"He used to be very shy. You needed to push him to talk. While most of us would have some story or the other to tell, Mayank would just smile and listen," Chhattisgarh captain and former Madhya Pradesh skipper Harpreet Singh, his former India under-19 teammate, recalled while speaking to TOI after Mayank's monumental double ton against Bangladesh on Friday.</p>
      <p>Apart from his shyness, there was another quality about Mayank that endeared him to his teenaged teammates: he was extremely forgetful, so much so that he was nicknamed 'Ghajini', from the popular Aamir Khan-starrer in which a tycoon suffers short-term memory loss. Harpreet recalled a funny incident during the South Africa tour in 2009. <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Chandrakant-Pandit">Chandrakant Pandit</a>, then the coach of India's under-19 team, had given the responsibility of the 'ball box' to Agarwal.</p>
      <p>"Mayank forgot to carry the box during one of the practice sessions. He was so scared the whole while. We named him 'Ghajini' because of his habit of forgetting little things and then suddenly recalling them after 15-20 minutes. It was so funny," he said.</p>
      <p>"He always had that class about him...those flowing drives and the way he would dance down the wicket to hit spinners. He was always very aggressive on the field, but totally opposite off it. We had a fabulous group... Mayank, KL Rahul, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Mandeep-Singh">Mandeep Singh</a>, Jaidev Undakat, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ashok-Menaria">Ashok Menaria</a>, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Manan-Sharma">Manan Sharma</a>, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Harshal-Patel">Harshal Patel</a>. None of us played selfish cricket and that's the reason most of us are still doing well," Harpreet said.</p>
      <p>Harpreet recently met Mayank during Vijay Hazare Trophy in Bengaluru. "He hasn't changed a bit. He has become more confident while talking. He now presents himself very well, which you expect from someone playing for the country. I am sure, he will have a long international career," he signed off. Needless to say, 'Ghajini' Mayank also won't forget his second double ton in Tests in a hurry!</p>
