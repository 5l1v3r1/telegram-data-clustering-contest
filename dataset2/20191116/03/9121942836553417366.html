      <p>MEDAN, Indonesia (AP) — Police say they have shot and killed two suspected militants who may have had links to a suicide attack at a busy police station in Indonesia’s third-largest city.</p>
      <p>North Sumatra police chief Agus Andrianto says three suspected militants refused to surrender and resisted by firing guns at members of a police counterterrorism squad in a raid Saturday in North Sumatra province’s Hamparan Perak village.</p>
      <p>He says two suspects were fatally shot, while an officer was taken to the hospital with a gunshot wound to his thigh.</p>
      <p>Police are still searching the third suspect, who escaped during the shootout.</p>
      <p>Police were tipped off to the suspected militants after interrogations of suspects arrested after Wednesday’s suicide bomb attack on a police station in Medan that wounded at least six people.</p>
