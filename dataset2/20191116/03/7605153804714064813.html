        <b><i>Bamako, Mali, Nov 16 – </i>Thousands of people took to the streets of Mali’s capital Bamako on Friday to support the West African country’s army, which has suffered heavy losses as it struggles to quell a jihadist revolt.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The rally came as a grim discovery in the fragile Sahel nation’s conflict-wracked centre illustrated the size of the challenge the army faces.</p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>“Twenty bodies, some abandoned in wells, were found” by soldiers in the village of Peh in the central Mopti region on Wednesday, the government said.</p>
      <p>The soldiers were sent to the village after reports of an attack by “unidentified individuals dressed in hunter’s clothes,” the government said in a statement Friday.</p>
      <p>The group “abandoned stolen herds and retreated” when the soldiers arrived, the statement added, without saying how the 20 people died.</p>
      <p>A rising jihadist insurgency that spread from the north to the centre of Mali has inflamed tensions between herders and sedentary farmers. Hundreds of lives have been lost in tit-for-tat assaults.</p>
      <p>In Bamako, protest organisers said around 15,000 people marched in support of the army, while the police put the number at “several thousand”.</p>
      <p>Demonstrators held up signs saying “No embezzlement of our funds” and “Long live FAMA (Malian armed forces)”.</p>
      <p>Opposition leader Soumaila Cisse said the government had betrayed the army.</p>
      <p>“Our soldiers are ill-equipped. We should be fighting for our military to be up to the job,” he said, blaming corruption.</p>
      <p>Former minister and opposition figure Mohamed Ali Bathily said “the military and ministers who are behind this corruption must be judged”.</p>
      <p>In the last month around 100 Malian soldiers have been killed in two of the deadliest attacks in the country’s history.</p>
      <p>The army has been battling to contain the Islamist insurgency despite help from France, African neighbours and the United Nations.</p>
