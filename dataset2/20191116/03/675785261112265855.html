      <h1>Liverpool 'buy Brendan Rodgers' £3.75m house and rent it to Jurgen Klopp for free'</h1>
      <h2>Klopp had been renting the property from his predecessor Rodgers - now Liverpool have bought it to reward manager for guiding Reds back to top of world game</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T03:07:21+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 03:07</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool have bought the house Jurgen Klopp was renting from Brendan Rogers and are allowing the Reds boss to live there rent free, it has been reported.</p>
      <p>Klopp succeeded Rodgers as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> manager in October 2015, and has turned the Reds into arguably the world's most feared football team.</p>
      <p>His Liverpool team won the Champions League in June having reached the final the previous campaign, and are huge favourites to win the Premier League this season, finally ending the club's 30-year wait for the top-flight title.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jurgen-klopp">Klopp</a> has been living in the same house where Rodgers was based when he was Liverpool boss, with the German renting the property from his predecessor.</p>
      <p>The seven-bedroom house in Formby in Merseyside was put up for sale by Rodgers last summer.</p>

      <p>And the club have now bought the property for £3.75million, according to the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7690841/AHEAD-GAME-Liverpool-buy-Rodgers-house-3-75m-allow-Klopp-live-rent-free.html">Daily Mail</a> .</p>
      <p>The Mail reports that Liverpool are believed to be allowing Klopp to live rent free in the house, although he will pay tax on its rental value as the perk is regarded by HMRC as an addition to salary as a benefit-in-kind.</p>
      <p>The purchase of the house is reward for Klopp's achievements in taking Liverpool back to the top of the world game - while the club are also looking at it as an investment, enabling them to do the same for future managers.</p>

      <p>Klopp's men are currently eight points clear at the top of the Premier League after missing out on the title by a point last term to treble-winners <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> . Rodgers' <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> City side are currently Liverpool's their nearest challengers.</p>
      <p>Rodgers also narrowly missed out on ending Liverpool's title drought, with his Reds side having finished two points behind City in the 2013-4 season.</p>
      <p>Klopp is contracted to Liverpool until the summer of 2022, and it is unclear at the moment whether he will stay at Anfield beyond that.</p>
