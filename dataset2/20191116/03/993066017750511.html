      <p>Anthology series American Crime Story will focus on Mr Clinton’s relationship with Monica Lewinsky, which rocked the US and nearly brought down the president.</p>

      <p>It was previously announced Beanie Feldstein will star as Lewinsky.</p>
      <p>Sarah Paulson will star as Linda Tripp, the civil servant who secretly recorded Lewinsky’s confidential phone calls about her affair with the president.</p>
      <p>Annaleigh Ashford will portray Paula Jones, who sued Mr Clinton for sexual harassment.</p>
      <p>The role of Hillary Clinton is yet to be cast. Lewinsky will serve as a producer on the series, which is created by prolific TV producer Ryan Murphy.</p>
      <p>Lewinsky was a 22-year-old White House intern when she had an affair with then 49-year-old Mr Clinton while he was US president between 1995 and 1997.</p>
      <p>She was subjected to intense public scrutiny following what he called an “inappropriate relationship” and later admitted her mental health took a battering during the scandal.</p>
      <p>Impeachment proceedings were launched but Mr Clinton was cleared of charges of perjury and obstruction of justice following a 21-day Senate trial.</p>
      <p>This will be the third season of American Crime Story. Season one, titled The People v O J Simpson, explored the murder trial of O J Simpson.</p>
      <p>Season two, titled The Assassination of Gianni Versace, featured the killing of the famed fashion designer.</p>
