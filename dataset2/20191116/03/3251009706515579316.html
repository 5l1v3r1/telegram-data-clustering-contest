        </i>
      </p>
      <p>There are four states that share a border with Pakistan, namely, Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Rajasthan, and Gujarat. The India–Pakistan Border is quite intriguing. Since India has installed 1,50,000 flood lights on around 50,000 poles, the border can be seen from space at night.</p>
      <p>It is also considered the world’s one of the most dangerous borders. Locally, it is also known as International Border (IB). The IB is stretched from Jammu and Kashmir at the north to the Zero Point between Gujarat in India and Sindh province in Pakistan. It is of a total length of 3,323 kilometres.</p>
