      <h1>Video: Alia Bhatt visits Priyanka Chopra at her Juhu residence and we can’t keep calm!</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T03:34:45+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 03:34</time> by <a rel="author">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Priyanka-Chopra">Priyanka Chopra</a> was busy shooting for her next venture in Delhi and returned to bay this week. From enjoying a paan to raising awareness about the pollution level in the capital, PeeCee shared several updates from the sets. The actress was snapped at the Mumbai airport on Thursday and on Friday evening she was visited by Bollywood’s favourite millennial <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Alia-Bhatt">Alia Bhatt</a>. The ‘Raazi’ actress was snapped by the paparazzi as she left from PeeCee’s Juhu residence late on Friday night. We can’t keep calm knowing that the two powerhouse stars were together and would give an arm and leg to be a fly on the wall!</p>

      <p>Last year the two contemporaries were snapped living it up in New York. While PeeCee was in NYC for an event, Alia was in the city with beau <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ranbir-Kapoor">Ranbir Kapoor</a> and his parents Rishi and Neetu Kapoor. Pictures of the two <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Bollywood">Bollywood</a> beauties soon went viral on the internet.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, Alia Bhatt recently replaced Priyanka Chopra in a film. <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sanjay-Leela-Bhansali">Sanjay Leela Bhansali</a> had planned to make ‘Gangubai’ with Priyanka, but eventually it was Alia who bagged the film. A source had informed ETimes, “‘Gangubai’ was initially to be made with Rani Mukerji in the lead. However, things didn’t work out with Rani and that’s when he decided to ask Priyanka Chopra while filming ‘Bajirao Mastani’. The project couldn’t take off as PeeCee was running on a tight schedule while also pursuing a career in Hollywood.”</p>
