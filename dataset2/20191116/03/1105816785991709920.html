      <p><b>ISLAMABAD: </b>Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Anwar Mansoor Khan has strongly defended setting up military administered internment centres, whose main purpose, according to him, is elimination of terrorism through reeducation of miscreants.</p>
      <p>Appearing before a Supreme Court five-judge larger bench, headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Asif Saeed Khosa, the AGP on Friday said internment centres are necessary to reeducate miscreants.</p>
      <p>He revealed that 72 individuals were rounded up and kept in an internment centre for two years where they were de-radicalized through education. Later, they were released and allowed to return home.</p>

      <p>He said under the law, the detainees might meet their families during their confinement. They could even write letters to their family after every 15 days, he added.</p>
      <p>However, he admitted that there are individuals who could not meet their families due to ‘certain reasons’. The AGP also offered to show videos about functioning of the internment centres, which, he said, were established to eliminate terrorism.</p>
      <p>The chief justice noted that the court is examining legality of these centres.  He asked the AGP to explain why these centres were established and what the law says about them.</p>
      <p>Another member of the bench said the term non-state actor was introduced after 9/11, adding that no state protects non-state actors working against its interests. “The US has set up a detention facility in Guantánamo Bay outside its territorial limits for such elements,” he said.</p>
      <p>However, he asked the AGP whether the state institutions have evidences to prove that the detainees are non-state actors. Anwar Mansoor Khan replied in the affirmative, saying they had evidence.</p>
      <p>The CJP observed that it might be possible that these internment centres were established on basis of the doctrine of necessity as the country is being targeted by enemy states.  The AGP said he will try to convince the bench that the internment centres are working legally and are a need of the hour.</p>

      <p>Justice Khosa noted that “no one is supporting terrorism. It should be dealt with iron hand and special measures should be taken.” Hearing of the case was later adjourned till next Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The larger bench is hearing the federal and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) governments’ appeal against the Peshawar High Court’s (PHC) order to annul the Action (in Aid of Civil Power) Ordinance, 2019.</p>
      <p>The ordinance issued by the K-P governor on August 5 gave a legal cover to several detention centres set up during military operations in the erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata) which was merged with the K-P last year.</p>
      <p>The ordinance also assigned wide-ranging powers to authorised officers and armed forces, besides giving an interning authority to detain a suspect until the continuation of action in aid of civil power by the armed forces.</p>
      <p>However, the PHC on Oct 18 declared it unconstitutional and in violation of all fundamental rights as enshrined in the Constitution. It directed the K-P government to share the list of inmates with the police department, while directing the provincial police chief to take over all ‘illegal’ internment centres.</p>
      <p>The federal and K-P governments later challenged the PHC order in the apex court.</p>
