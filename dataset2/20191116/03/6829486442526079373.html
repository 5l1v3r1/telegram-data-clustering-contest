      <h1>Kristen Stewart And Shia LaBeouf Went Wild Interviewing Each Other And The Internet’s Obsessed</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T03:04:45+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 03:04</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Earp</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://junkee.com/kristen-stewart-hot-ones/230124">Kristen Stewart</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_LaBeouf">Shia LaBeouf</a> have slowly — and somewhat surprisingly — become two of the most chaotic actors in Hollywood.</p>
      <p>In fact, their respective careers sit in close parallel with each other. Both started out as rosy-faced child actors in small, indie projects. Then, they morphed into the faces of big-budget Hollywood franchises — Stewart with <i>Twilight</i>, LaBeouf with <i>Transformers — </i>before finally bucking the process of altogether and becoming weirdo auteurs.</p>

      <p>LaBeouf just starred as his own father in the quasi-autobiographical <i>Honey Boy</i>, while Stewart just played American actress Jean Seberg in a dark and difficult film about her frequent run-ins with the FBI.</p>
      <p>So yeah, these aren’t exactly two of the most mainstream actors in Hollywood — something that only became more obvious when the pair were chucked in a room and forced to interview each other as part of <i>Variety</i>‘s Actors on Actors series.</p>
      <p>The interviews are designed to be the start of the Oscar race, an opportunity for the frontrunners to show to the Academy their most pleasant, agreeable side. Thus, most of the videos in this year’s series have seen the actors play it very straight: Eddie Murphy and Antonio Banderas had a serious and considered conversation about blaxploitation, Brad Pitt and Adam Sandler talked about the future of the industry, and Robert Pattinson and Jennifer Lopez discussed the male gaze.</p>
      <p>Stewart and LaBeouf, mind you, decided to talk about hands. Like, human hands. And then they completely forgot core details from their own movies.</p>
      <p>Feast your eyes, for instance, on this:</p>

      <p>The whole thing only gets more barmy from there, resulting in a series of alternately intense and hilarious asides about fame, sobriety, PTSD and hands (again.) I don’t know what more to tell you, because art like this must be imbibed, immediately, rather than being described:</p>
