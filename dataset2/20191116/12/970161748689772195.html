      <p>A taxi driver who used an interpreter to say his English was good enough for the job had his licence revoked for failing to mention his conviction for selling illegal tobacco.</p>
      <p>Yawar Latif was set to hit the road in a hackney carriage after passing all of Newcastle City Council’s licence checks, including having a good grasp of the English language.</p>
      <p>But question marks were raised over his honesty after background checks revealed he narrowly dodged a jail sentence for flogging 20,000 dodgy cigarettes from the back of a car.</p>
      <p>The former takeaway worker begged for his licence to be returned and said he believed he only had to disclose convictions for driving offences or violence.</p>
      <p>Magistrates had earlier questioned his grasp of English, so Latif told the court he would chat to passengers and didn’t have any problems understanding directions.</p>

      <p>But every word of the court hearing had to be translated for him by an interpreter.</p>

      <p>Officers at Newcastle City Council stressed drivers’ English did not have to be perfect although they should understand what was being said.</p>
      <p>Remarking on the time police found him with 20,000 cigarettes and 20.8 kilos of tobacco before his conviction, Latif said, through his translator, that he had made a ‘stupid mistake’.</p>
      <p>He added: ‘I learned from that a very, very good lesson.’</p>
      <p>He was handed 240 hours of unpaid work for the £10,000 plot while the council’s regulatory committee ruled this July that he was no longer a ‘fit and proper person’ to hold a licence.</p>
      <p>The applicant, who lived in Elswick at the time of his conviction, repeatedly pleaded for a second chance by claiming he had been ‘punished already’ by the courts.</p>
      <p>Joanne Bagshaw, prosecuting for the council, said his convictions were serious.</p>
      <p>She explained: ‘This is not a situation of someone buying a couple of extra sleeves of cigarettes back from their holiday.’</p>
      <p>Despite using an interpreter in his latest court appearance, he attended the hearing when his licence was initially granted on his own.</p>
