      <p>The story of how a Derbyshire man attempted to swindle the £1m jackpot prize on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire is being turned into an ITV drama.</p>
      <p>Charles Ingram, originally from Shardlow, cheated his way to win the seven-figure sum on the popular British game show in 2001.</p>
      <p>The ex-Army Major successfully answered all of Chris Tarrant's questions and was later found guilty of deception when a jury believed he used an accomplice who coughed when an answer was correct.</p>
      <p>The upcoming ITV three-parter, called “Quiz”, will feature Michael Sheen as TV presenter Chris Tarrant.</p>
      <p>The three-part drama is directed by globally renowned director Stephen Frears and written by playwright James Graham.</p>
      <p>It will star Matthew Macfadyen as Major Charles Ingram, Sian Clifford as Diana Ingram, Mark Bonnar as Celador Television chairman Paul Smith, Helen McCrory as Sonia Woodley QC, Michael Jibson as Tecwen Whittock and Aisling Bea as ITV entertainment commissioner Claudia Rosencrantz.</p>

      <p>Ingram has kept a low profile since the scandal 18 years ago.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/9739754/coughing-major-who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-cheat-charles-ingram-declares-bankruptcy-fourth-time/">The Sun</a>, Charles and Diana Ingram declared themselves bankrupt for the fourth time in 2016.</p>
      <p>The newspaper also reported he was selling homemade brooches for £5 and necklaces for up to £40.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the reboot of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, The Sun pictured him loading up his belongings into a van to move to a flat on a remote farm after the scandal turned him into a recluse.</p>
