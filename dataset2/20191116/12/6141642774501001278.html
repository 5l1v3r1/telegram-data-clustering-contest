      <p>Boris Johnson has been told to deliver on his Brexit promises or face receiving an unpleasant letter.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister knocked on doors in Mansfield in a bid to boost the election cause of Tory candidate Ben Bradley, who won the seat from Labour in 2017 by a majority of 1,057.</p>
      <p>They received a positive response from the four houses they visited in Millersdale Avenue, although one resident sought assurances over the Brexit deal on offer.</p>

      <p>She said afterwards her heart was going “ten to the dozen” and she was “absolutely shocked” to see Mr Johnson.</p>
      <p>She told the PA news agency: “I told him I was worried about the deal he was making and asked him specifically if their laws could overrule our laws because that’s what I’ve heard.</p>
      <p>“He said no, absolutely not, so I says to him if you’re wrong I’m going to write you a letter – and it won’t be pleasant.”</p>
      <blockquote>Jesus Christ, I cannot believe you are outside my mum and dad’s house<cite>Mansfield resident Lucy Camm</cite></blockquote>
      <p>At the first house, Lucy Camm met the PM outside before he could reach the door and took a photo with him.</p>
      <p>She said: “Jesus Christ, I cannot believe you are outside my mum and dad’s house. I cannot believe you’re in our street.</p>
      <p>“You have definitely got our vote. We do not like Jeremy (Corbyn).”</p>
      <p>Ms Camm told PA: “I just can’t believe he’s here.</p>
      <p>“I wish I was kind of dressed a bit more appropriately and didn’t come running out in my socks, but it’s good though.”</p>
      <p>Her mother Susan Camm, 70, also spoke with the PM.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson received a positive response at the second property while at the final house one man greeted Mr Johnson by saying: “It’s good to see you young man.”</p>
      <p>Further planned Nottinghamshire visits to plant a tree, in connection with one of the party’s pledges, and to meet farmers were cancelled due to a change in the PM’s schedule.</p>
