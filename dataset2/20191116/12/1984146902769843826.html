        <figcaption>The stats that have defined Sunderland's season so far</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Every Sunderland player is potentially playing for their future at the club, with January around the corner.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/phil-parkinson">Phil Parkinson</a> wants to strengthen his squad when the transfer market opens in the new year, and he has been assessing his squad closely since his arrival to see what areas he feels need strengthening most.</p>
      <p>And while meetings have already taken place with the scouting team over the kind of players Parkinson will want to add to his squad in January, he has also admitted that those already at the club can still impress him and change his opinion before the window opens.</p>
      <p>But with SCMP rules to meet, if Parkinson is to make additions to his <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland-afc">Black Cats</a> squad then it's likely some players might have to be moved on too.</p>
      <p>With nine games left before the window opens, here are eight players in particular who have a big point to prove.</p>
      <h3>Alim Ozturk</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/incoming/article16944220.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Benfica-B-v-Sunderland-Pre-Season-Friendly.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <p>Injury has resulted in the Turkish centre-back featuring for just 35 minutes under Parkinson so far.</p>
      <p>The defender is very much a no-nonsense style player and the manager, who puts particular emphasis on his defence, recently praised the 26-year-old.</p>
      <p>But even before Parkinson's arrival he fell down the pecking order at the Stadium of Light, with Joel Lynch and Jordan Willis building a potent partnership. Ozturk can also be clumsy at times, and with six months left on his contract, Parkinson might move him on in favour of adding a defender more suited to the high intensity style he wants Sunderland to play at.</p>
      <h3>Tom Flanagan</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>If Ozturk can get fit and take an opportunity, perhaps more in danger of facing the axe in January is Northern Ireland international Tom Flanagan.</p>
      <p>The ex-Burton man has struggled for form on Wearside and has often found himself in and out of the team as a result.</p>
      <p>Flanagan needs to impress with whatever opportunities he gets between now and January. With six months left on his contract, Parkinson may well look to get somebody else in who he feels he can rely on more.</p>
      <p>Away on international duty, he won't get the chance at Gillingham next week in the FA Cup replay, although injury concerns for both Joel Lynch and Jordan Willis at Scunthorpe mean Flanagan could still get his chance to impress yet.</p>
      <h3>Laurens De Bock</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Having missed pre-season at Leeds, the Belgian has struggled to get up to speed at Sunderland since his arrival, and missed Parkinson's first few games in charge through injury.</p>
      <p>When fit, Parkinson has since preferred young Denver Hume.</p>
      <p>Only on loan from Leeds, there's every chance Sunderland could cancel that loan if Parkinson can line up a better replacement in January.</p>
      <p>De Bock recently admitted he'd not spoken to anyone from Leeds since joining the Black Cats. For his own sake he needs a strong six weeks to ensure he at least spends the rest of the season at the Stadium of Light.</p>
      <h3>Dylan McGeouch</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/incoming/article16612245.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Benfica-B-v-Sunderland-Pre-Season-Friendly.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Dylan McGeouch of Sunderland<cite>(Image: Sunderland AFC via Getty Images)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Since his arrival, Parkinson has put faith in the midfield duo of Max Power and George Dobson, preferring their energy and athleticism compared to that of Grant Leadbitter and Dylan McGeouch.</p>
      <p>McGeouch has played just one game since Parkinson's arrival, and failed to impress in the defeat against Leicester City's under-21s.</p>
      <p>While he certainly has quality, there are question marks over whether he suits Parkinson's style of play, and he doesn't have long to prove otherwise.</p>
      <h3>Aiden McGeady</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Similar to McGeouch, McGeady is another who has question marks over his suitability to the high intensity, fast-tempo football that the Black Cats boss wants.</p>
      <p>McGeady missed Parkinson's big win against Tranmere, and also missed some of the best performances this season under Ross too - notably the home win over MK Dons.</p>
      <p>McGeady hasn't been in form of late at all, and his style means he quite often slows play down, when Sunderland need to do the exact opposite to break deep-lying defences down.</p>
      <p>That said, McGeady has undoubted quality. Despite being nowhere near his best yet he still has five goals and two assists this term. His great form of last season didn't start until around Christmas either, so there's hope yet, that he could still turn things around and spearhead Sunderland's promotion challenge.</p>
      <h3>Will Grigg, Charlie Wyke and Marc McNulty</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/incoming/article16668936.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_SAFCs-all-time-greatest-XI-1.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Will Grigg, Charlie Wyke and Marc McNulty</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>It's no secret that Sunderland are struggling for goals, and it's no secret that all three of Sunderland's strikers are struggling for confidence.</p>
      <p>Charlie Wyke has played just 45 minutes under Parkinson - injuring his ankle and coming off at half time of the new boss' debut at Wycombe. He's close to full fitness and should, on paper, suit Parkinson's style of play perfectly.</p>
      <p>Will Grigg will be hard to move on because of his wages and the price tag Sunderland paid for him just 12 months ago. But even owner Stewart Donald admitted right now they're not getting good value for money out of the misfiring striker. He has been the preferred choice of Parkinson, however.</p>
      <p>Marc McNulty, meanwhile, is on loan from Reading and had a great start to the season before injuries made it a rather stop-start campaign. He's had limited opportunities under the new boss who just doesn't seem to fancy him much right now.</p>
      <p>It's likely Parkinson would like to add a new striker in January, although, as Sunderland found with Grigg, they don't come cheap. He might have to terminate McNulty's loan early or find a new home for Wyke or Grigg is he's to do so.</p>
