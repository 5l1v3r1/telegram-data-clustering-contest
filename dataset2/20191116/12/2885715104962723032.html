      <p>People are out on the streets in Bolivia for over three weeks after the country’s first indigenous president Evo Morales was forced to step down due to military and public pressure over allegations of electoral fraud in the 2019 general elections. Though an interim administration has taken charge and called for fresh elections, the country is still under turmoil over the political uncertainty.</p>
