        <b>Leinster have made a late change to their starting XV for their Champions Cup opener against Benetton with Rory O’Loughlin replacing Joe Tomane.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 29-year-old New Zealand native has withdrawn from the matchday squad after suffering a tight hamstring during Friday’s captains run.</p>
      <p>O’Loughlin is set to make an appearance in the centre <a href="https://punditarena.com/rugby/kennedymarisa760/irish-provinces-champions-cup-weekend/">alongside Garry Ringrose</a> while Robbie Henshaw takes his place on the bench.</p>

      <p>The Ireland international had previously been left out of the squad with an illness that also saw him miss last week’s dominant inter-provincial win over Connacht in the Sportsground.</p>
      <p>Leinster have named a strong team as they get another European campaign underway with Johnny Sexton returning from international duty to captain the side.</p>
      <p>Kick-off in the RDS Arena this afternoon is 3.15pm.</p>
      <p><b>Leinster:</b> Jordan Larmour, Dave Kearney, Garry Ringrose, Rory O’Loughlin, James Lowe, Johhny Sexton, Luke McGrath; Cian Healy, Rónan Kelleher, Andrew Porter, Devin Toner, James Ryan, Rhys Ruddock, Josh van der Flier, Caelan Doris.</p>
      <p><b>Replacements:</b> James Tracy, Peter Dooley, Michael Bent, Scott Fardy, Max Deegan, Jamison Gibson-Park, Ross Byrne, Robbie Henshaw.</p>
