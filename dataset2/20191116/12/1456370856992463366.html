        <b>Five Years Ago</b>
      </p>
      <p>This week in 2014, the amicus briefs were rolling in on Google's <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141108/06411929085/computer-scientists-legal-experts-explain-to-supreme-court-why-apis-are-not-copyrightable.shtml">first attempt to get SCOTUS to hear the Oracle case</a>. We were surprised when Obama <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141110/06490829092/surprise-president-obama-calls-real-net-neutrality.shtml">called for real net neutrality</a>, and not so surprised when <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141110/08353029094/broadband-industry-title-ii-is-bad-because-only-broken-congress-awash-our-lobbying-cash-should-guide-net-neutrality.shtml">the broadband industry</a> and <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141111/05323229102/t-mobiles-ultra-hip-ceo-not-so-ultra-hip-when-it-comes-to-his-clumsy-status-quo-opposition-to-net-neutrality.shtml">T-Mobile's CEO</a> and <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141110/17372829099/anti-net-neutrality-crowd-reaches-deep-craziest-possible-response-to-president-obamas-call-real-net-neutrality-rules.shtml">the rest of the anti-net-neutrality brigade</a> freaked out in response. Meanwhile, Techdirt got dragged into the Roca Labs affair when Roca bizarrely <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141111/16161229110/roca-labs-sues-opposing-lawyer-marc-randazza-because-what-we-wrote-techdirt.shtml">sued Marc Randazza largely over a post <i>we</i> wrote</a>, just before it began issuing <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141112/06565329116/roca-labs-issues-bogus-dmca-takedown-notices-to-google-to-try-to-hide-pissedconsumer-reviews.shtml">bogus DMCA notices to Google</a> over PissedConsumer reviews. This was also the week we <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141112/16555429125/techdirt-podcast-episode-1-can-you-increase-privacy-with-more-surveillance-more-transparency.shtml">launched the Techdirt podcast</a>.</p>

        <b>Ten Years Ago</b>
      </p>
      <p>This week in 2009, a Danish anti-piracy group was <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20091106/1523206840.shtml">withdrawing all its lawsuits against individuals</a> after it lost most of them, though this just spurred the IFPI to say <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20091109/0932206853.shtml">it would start seizing computers to get more evidence</a>. The UK was moving towards <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20091109/1250546857.shtml">forcing ISPs to retain user data</a> and <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20091111/1412276902.shtml">kicking people off the internet</a>, while Rupert Murdoch was audaciously claiming that <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20091108/2223416852.shtml">fair use could be struck down entirely by the courts</a>, and we took a look at how a lot of Murdoch's own websites <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20091111/0049546883.shtml">contained aggregators just like the ones he was so angry about</a>. Verizon started <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20091113/1244356923.shtml">passing on RIAA letters to users</a>, the MPAA got a town's public wi-fi shut down <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20091110/0744136875.shtml">over one single unauthorized movie download</a>, and we looked closer at Bluebeat's <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20091109/1005266855.shtml">bizarre "psycho-acoustic simulation" copyright claim</a> on Beatles songs.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Fifteen Years Ago</b>
      </p>
      <p>This week in 2004, Monster Cable was establishing its <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20041110/0531219.shtml">reputation as a trademark monster</a>, Blockbuster was making the questionable decision to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20041111/0723216.shtml">buy more stores</a>, and the entertainment industry <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20041112/194244.shtml">just couldn't quite give up on self-destructing DVDs</a>. The <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20041111/1146208.shtml">deluge of video ads on the web</a> was just beginning, though it probably wasn't yet quite as annoying as <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20041108/1251234.shtml">AOL's very stupid TV commercials</a>. The notion of selling instead of going public was <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20041109/0522236.shtml">becoming mainstream for tech startups</a>, and Google's not-so-revolutionary IPO was not <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20041109/0511212.shtml">kickstarting the Dutch Auction trend many people expected</a>. And lastly, this was the week <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20041109/0534248.shtml">Firefox officially hit version 1.0</a>.</p>
