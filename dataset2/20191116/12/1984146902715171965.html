      <h2>Award-winning Northumberland brewery Twice Brewed Brew House is tapping into growing 'brew-it-yourself' interest in beer fans with brewing experience</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T12:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Mike Kelly</a></address>
      <p>Whilst mainstream pubs continue to struggle in challenging economic conditions, a booming industry can be found elsewhere in the brewing industry.</p>
      <p>Many North East areas boast their fair share of micro pubs and micro breweries, a ‘brew-it-yourself’ revolution whose influence continues to grow as more and more people aspire to go their own way.</p>
      <p>But how to get started? Well the Twice Brewed Brew House <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/northumberland">in Northumberland</a> is giving people the opportunity to spend two days as a brewer in their award-winning brewery.</p>
      <p>It is situated on one of the most dramatic stretches of Hadrian’s Wall in an area where brewing has gone back to Roman times, and aspiring modern-day brewers will be invited to spend two days with head brewer, Matthew Brown.</p>

      <p>“I came up with the idea for the ‘Become A Brewer’ experience after chatting with customers on brewery tours and other events,” Matthew revealed. “I learnt that there are a lot of people out there who would like to know a lot more about the process, as well as home brewers that would like to brew on a bigger kit.</p>
      <p>“So that made me think, why don’t we offer this as an experience? Something more that a brewery tour where they can ask in-depth questions and get hands-on experience in a commercial brewery.</p>
      <p>“They can then take the information they have learnt and brew their own beer on our small brew kit with full access to our malt and hop supplies. I will be there to help guide them, but they can brew any beer they like.”</p>
      <p>Those who take up the offer will get the opportunity to learn the whole brewing process, from the four raw ingredients right through to the final product.</p>
      <p>Matthew said: “The first day will be spent with me in the brewery, brewing one of the core beers from our range; they will get hands on experience of the whole process where I will be explaining how everything works and how it affects the final beer.</p>

      <p>“They will learn how to pick malt out to create different beers as well as what hops we use and what flavours we get from them.</p>
      <p>“The whole point of the first day of the experience is to give them an idea of how the process works so they can go into the second day with confidence when brewing their own beer.”</p>
      <p>Matthew’s career arc saw him initially start working in pubs that sold a lot of real ale, progressed to looking after the cellar and then on to being a manager.</p>
      <p>“Ordering and looking after beer from a pub side of things made me interested in beer and how it is made, as well how it should stored and served,” he added.</p>
      <p>“I am a curious person and I like to learn new things, so when the opportunity came up to work in a brewery I jumped at the chance.”</p>
      <p>From there he got hands-on experience as well as training courses at BrewLab in Sunderland. Eventually the position of Head Brewer came up and he was offered the role.</p>
      <p>The Twice Brewed Brew House was established in June 2017. The first beer to come out of the Brew House was Sycamore Gap, a 4.1% Pale Ale, followed by Twice Brewed Bitter, Ale Caesar Amber Ale and finally, Vindolanda IPA.</p>
      <p>Within a year of opening it launched its first dark beer, Steel Rigg Porter, which win a Silver award at the SIBA North East Awards in 2018.</p>

      <p>Later in 2018 they expanded the capacity of the Brew House by adding two more fermenting tanks, doubling its weekly production.</p>
      <p>At the start of 2019 it launched a range of cans, one of which, Northern Frontier IPA, went on to win Gold at the SIBA NE Awards.</p>
      <p>“Since then we also achieved second place at Newcastle Beer Festival for Nox, our cherry milk stout,” said Matthew, “and to round off the year we have just launched three new beers in bottles.</p>
      <p>“These beers celebrate space exploration as well as the Dark Skies park which the Brew House sits in. Luna, Apollo and Nox offer something new to our range as the styles are a bit more modern than our core beers.”</p>
      <p>Matthew said there is a rich history of brewing in the area with Atrectus, the first named brewer in British history, crafting beer at Vindolanda, which lies just one and a half miles away.</p>
      <p>“Atrectus brewed on the site from 79AD and was originally from Belgium - they believe they may have imported some Belgium beer,” he said.</p>
      <p>“There is also the camping grounds for the armies involved in the B<a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/hexham">attle of Hexham nearby</a>, these would also have had a brewer with them.”</p>
      <p>Beer was brewed for a couple of reasons, the main one being that the process is basically a way of cleaning and sanitizing water and then preserving it.</p>
      <p>“Boiling and hops are for cleaning and sanitizing, the alcohol is there to preserve it,” explained Matthew. “So after a long time of not much brewing in the area – traditionally it is a very lawless region with a lot of unrest – we decided to bring brewing back to the area and created the Brew House.</p>

      <p>“Taking the names of local features for our core beers and all our specials named after Roman gods and goddess, is a reflection of the impact the Romans have had on the area.”</p>
      <p>And maybe those taking up the Brewery Experience offer might, in the future, make a bit of an impact themselves.</p>
      <p>Matthew said: “If it inspires some people to seek out a career in the industry then that would be fantastic.</p>
      <p>“If you have an interest in brewing and enjoy learning new things then that is a great start; hopefully our experience can give you a taster of that and go on to inspire you.</p>
      <p>“I would love it if the ‘Become A Brewer’ experience inspired them to become a full-time brewer! I have a real passion and enthusiasm for the job, and I like to pass that on.</p>
      <p>“I don’t see other breweries as competition, I think a lot of brewers just like great beer so they want to see everyone making great beer – of course it’s nice when a customer picks your beer.”</p>
      <p>* The two-day (and two night) Brewery Experience at Twice Brewed Brew House and the Twice Brewed Inn costs £350 for one person of £540 for two people (based on sharing a room).</p>
      <p>The package includes bed and breakfast, lunch and dinner at the popular Twice Brewed Inn, which boasts a hearty home-cooked menu and 19 en suite bedrooms to choose from. For more information, visit <a href="http://www.twicebrewedinn.co.uk/">www.twicebrewedinn.co.uk</a></p>
