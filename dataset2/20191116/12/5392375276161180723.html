      <p>Google Drive backup stops working on Android mobile devices<br/>4.7 (93.33%) 3 votes</p>
      <p>Performing the function of backing up data to the Google Drive cloud service was unexpectedly problematic for some users of <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/Android">Android</a> devices.</p>
      <p>The first reports that users cannot save backups to the <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/">cloud</a> appeared nine months ago. But during this time, Google did nothing to solve the problem and the number of complaints only multiplied. Moreover, the company does not comment on the situation.</p>
      <h3>Google Drive: Android backup crashed</h3>
      <p>A failure occurs when you try to perform automatic and manual backups. Users are faced with the fact that the button that launches this function is inactive and all apps are indicated as those that are waiting for backup.</p>

      <p>All attempts to solve the problem by rebooting or re-authorizing did not succeed. The crash itself is observed on devices of various manufacturers running Android 9.0 Pie and Android 10.</p>
      <p>A message appeared on the XDA Developers forum that a series of manipulations using the Android Debug Bridge application debugging tool helps to solve the problem. But resorting to this method of “treatment” is only for those who are aware of the steps necessary for this type of action. And not for normal users.</p>
      <p>Google may not be telling us something. There could have been a big change but did not tell the Android community. Maybe it was waiting for us to only notice the change before it will publish an explanation.</p>
