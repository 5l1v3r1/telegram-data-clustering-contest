      <p><a href="https://science.slashdot.org/~pgmrdlm">pgmrdlm</a> quotes Futurism: <i>Massive Structures<br/>Galaxies millions of light years away <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/something-strange-synchronizing-distant-galaxies">seem to be connected by an unseen network of massive intergalactic structures</a>, which force them to synchronize in ways that can't be explained by existing astrophysics, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/zmj7pw/theres-growing-evidence-that-the-universe-is-connected-by-giant-structures">Vice reports</a>. The discoveries could force us to rethink our fundamental understanding of the universe.<br/><br/>"The observed coherence must have some relationship with large-scale structures, because it is impossible that the galaxies separated by six megaparsecs [roughly 20 million light years] directly interact with each other," Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute astronomer Hyeop Lee told the site.<br/><br/>There have been many instances of astronomers observing galaxies that seem to be connected and moving in sync with each other. A <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ab3fa3">study by Lee</a>, published in <i>The Astrophysical Journal</i> in October, found that hundreds of galaxies are rotating in exactly the same way, despite being millions of light years apart. And <a href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2014/12/aa24631-14/aa24631-14.html">a separate study</a>, published in the journal <i>Astronomy and Astrophysics</i> in 2014, found supermassive black holes aligning with each other, despite being billions of light years apart.</i></p>
