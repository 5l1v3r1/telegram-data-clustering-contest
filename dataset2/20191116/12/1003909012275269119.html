      <h1>Last: Wine, women and the Okanagan</h1>

      <p>For the longest time the wine industry, with some notable exceptions, had been male-dominated for longer than I care to remember. But change is inevitable, and changed it has. Happily the wine landscape is no longer a male domain, thanks in large part to women like Ann Sperling, one of B.C.’s most dynamic and forward thinking winemakers. She is modest about her role in this regard, preferring to hang her hat on her achievements as a winemaker, which are considerable. Her ancestors have a long history in the Okanagan, Italian immigrants who arrived in the valley in the early 1880s. They began growing grapes in the 1920s and eventually planted what are likely now the oldest vinifera vines in the valley, Riesling vines with 41 years of age behind them. She got her start working for Andres Wines in Port Moody and by 1991 she was serving as winemaker for Cedar Creek. She and her husband – wine consultant Peter Gamble – were instrumental in establishing Benjamin Bridge winery in Nova Scotia’s Gaspereau Valley in the year 2000, a winery that now produces what many consider the benchmark for sparkling wine in Canada. In 2005 she signed on with Ontario’s Southbrook Vineyards where she still serves as director of winemaking and viticulture. She is a leader in the organic and biodynamic viticulture movement (along with some natural wines), and by 2008 Southbrook became the first winery in Canada to achieve these certifications. If that’s not enough, in 2007 she and her husband partnered with Moray Tawse (of Tawse Winery fame in Ontario) and the McConnells (owners of Benjamin Bridge) to produce a wine called Versado made from an ancient Malbec vineyard they had discovered and subsequently purchased. Beneath her laid-back and affable demeanor is a woman who is clearly driven by the often challenging nature of the wine business.</p>
      <p>She’s not alone of course, in fact B.C.’s wine industry is quite progressive in that regard. There is an organization called Les Dames d’Escoffier, effectively an invitational organization of women leaders in food, beverage and hospitality whose mission is education, scholarship and philanthropy. They have chapters all over the world (Julia Child was a member) and many of B.C.’s female winemakers are involved in the organization. Mireille Sauvé serves as president of the B.C. chapter along with her other duties as winemaker and wine educator (she was also the youngest woman in Canada to become a certified sommelier in the mid-’90s). She produces a range of wines under the Dames label with 100 percent of the profits going to help support the organization. I could fill this page and many more with the names of the women who are changing the course of the wine industry for the better, both from B.C. and globally, but for now at the very least I am happy to recommend some of their efforts you can run out and try right now.</p>

        <b>Sperling Okanagan Valley Pinot Noir 2017 – $28</b>
      </p>
      <p>I’ve tasted some really good examples of Pinot Noir from the Okanagan of late and I think it has become apparent that there is a bright future for this grape in the valley. This is an elegant, nicely balanced expression of Pinot (and certified organic to boot) with a classic flavour profile. $28 represents good value for Pinot Noir from just about anywhere, let alone from one of Canada’s most talented winemakers. Try it with salmon or grilled chicken.</p>

        <b>Sperling Pinot Gris Okanagan Valley Pinot Gris 2017 – $22</b>
      </p>
      <p>Pinot Gris has become a signature white grape in the Okanagan; I’m not sure that was the right choice with some examples (Riesling and Chardonnay would get my vote for white varietals from this region) but this one is multi-dimensional (organic) with is nice expression of minerality, stone fruits and citrus. It would go nicely with shellfish or spaghetti carbonara.</p>

        <b>Versado Reserva Malbec 2013 – $58</b>
      </p>
      <p>Versado is Ann Sperling’s (and partners) Argentinian project produced from old vine Malbec, and as it happens the vineyard they purchased falls within very first sub-appellation to be designated in all of the Americas (Lujan de Cuyo). I find a lot of Malbec from Argentina to be a bit one dimensional but this wine is anything but. In the core black/blue fruits you will find notes of figs, fresh cut hay and spice with an enticing floral note. Lamb and game meat would be the way to go here.</p>

        <b>Haywire Pinot Gris Switchback Pinot Gris 2015 – $32</b>
      </p>
      <p>Christine Coletta is one the founding members and owners of Okanagan Crush Pad and another woman who has been instrumental in raising the bar in the B.C. wine realm. The Haywire Pinot Gris is a full-bodied interpretation of this grape with some tropical fruit and garrigue notes, rich enough to serve with roast pork, for example.</p>

        <b>Tinhorn Creek Oldfield Collection Syrah 2014 – $41</b>
      </p>
      <p>I think it’s safe to say that Sandra Oldfield is another Okanagan pioneer, and although she has left Tinhorn Creek after the winery was sold to Andrew Peller, her impact on the region and its wines will reverberate for many years to come. The Syrah sees a small addition of viognier and is a substantial wine with classic notes of spice, plums and a touch of savoury herbs. Try it with roast lamb of beef.</p>
