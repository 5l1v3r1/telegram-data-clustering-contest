      <p>The cast of <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!</a> 2019 have started landing in the jungle camp ahead of Sunday's launch.</p>
      <p>The stars were spotted looking a little nervous this morning as they took up their first task; making their way into the rainforest camp.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/anthony-mcpartlin">Ant McPartlin</a> and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/declan-donnelly">Declan Donnelly</a> were seen presenting together for the first time, concentrating as they watched the famous faces getting to grips with their challenge.</p>
      <p>At one point, Dec raised his arm as though to point something out to his best mate <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/ant-dec-1">Ant.</a></p>

      <p>Wearing red shirts to show which team they're on, Caitlyn Jenner and James Haskell were seen chatting together next to a helicopter before getting into a canoe and paddling their way over to the other shore.</p>

      <p>Good Morning Britain host Kate Garraway was also there, standing with the group as producers told them what they'd be doing.</p>

      <p>She was wearing a bright blue shirt, as was the comedian Andrew Maxwell, who could be seen in the back of a mud-splattered 4x4 with a huge grin on his face.</p>
      <p>Radio presenter Roman Kemp and Rak-Su singer Myles Stephenson are also on a team together, both wearing purple shirts.</p>
      <p>Nadine Coyle joined up with Adele Roberts for the yellow team.</p>

      <p>Ian Wright and Adele shared a hug before the task, with Ian wearing the colour green alongside a nervous Jacqueline Jossa.</p>
      <p>It means all 10 of the contestants are still in the programme, with no last-minute pull-outs.</p>
      <p>However, there may still be one late arrival left to come, as ITV bosses love to spring a surprise on the camp.</p>
      <p>I'm A Celebrity launches Sunday November 17 at 9pm on ITV, followed by Extra Camp</p>
