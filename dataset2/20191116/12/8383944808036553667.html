      <p>It is disrespectful to refer to the PKK's Syrian offshoots as "Kurds," President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said Saturday.</p>
      <p>"It is simply disrespectful to define YPG/PYD as Kurds," Erdoğan said in a joint groundbreaking ceremony of the Social Security Institution's district branches in Istanbul's Zeytinburnu district.</p>
      <p>The People's Protection Units (YPG) and its political wing, the Democratic Union Party (PYD), are the Syrian offshoots of the PKK, a designated terror organization in the U.S. and Turkey.</p>
      <p>Erdoğan was criticizing Western officials, especially the ones in the U.S., who refer to the terrorists as Kurds.</p>
      <p>Turkey launched Operation Peace Spring on Oct. 9 to eliminate YPG/PKK terrorists from northern Syria east of the Euphrates River in order to secure Turkey's borders, aid in the safe return of Syrian refugees and ensure Syria's territorial integrity.</p>
      <p>Ankara wants YPG/PKK terrorists to withdraw from the region so that a safe zone can be created to pave the way for the safe return of some two million refugees.</p>
      <p>On Oct. 17, the U.S. and Turkey came to an agreement to pause the operation to allow the withdrawal of terrorist YPG/PKK forces from the planned safe zone, where Ankara wants to repatriate millions of Syrian refugees it is currently hosting.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Erdoğan also said Turkey will not bow down to pressure by world powers and will continue to strive to independently meet its own defense needs, Erdoğan said.</p>
      <p>"We fulfilled our defense needs when some countries failed to sell us the products we wanted to purchase," the president noted.</p>
      <p>Over the last 16 years, the Turkish defense industry has gone through a profound transformation to domestically manufacture a series of military platforms, reaching up to 65% in domestic defense products as opposed to just 20% in early 2000.</p>
