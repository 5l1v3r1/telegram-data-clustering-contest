      <h2>The events will be happening at Ren's Pets in Kitchener and Waterloo</h2>

      <p>Santa Claus loves all the good boys and girls - whether they walk on two legs, or four! </p>
      <p>Calla Spencer is Senior Manager of Marketing and Communications for the Humane Society of Kitchener-Waterloo and Stratford-Perth. </p>
      <p>"We are bringing back our Pet Pics with Santa. We're very excited to be partnering again with Ren's Pets in both Waterloo and in Kitchener. And this year, we're really excited to be launching a new location at Fido's Playground in Stratford."</p>
      <p>If you're going to partake, you do need to keep some things in mind. </p>
      <p>"Make sure your pet is comfortable in a busy setting, with other pets around. We ask that all pets be on-leash or in a carrier. Preferably - not an extendable leash."</p>
      <p>Photos are $10 - and you can have as many as you'd like.</p>
      <p>"If you'd like to be in the pictures with your pet, or just have your pet with Santa, that's no problem at all. No appointments are required, you can just show up on the day and it's first-come first-serve."</p>
      <p>Spencer said last year, about 80 people showed up with their pets to have photos taken with Santa.</p>
      <p>"We had a variety of animals. We've had anything from cats and dogs, all the way from a snake show up for pet pics with Santa. So we're glad that Santa is normally reptile-friendly as well."</p>
