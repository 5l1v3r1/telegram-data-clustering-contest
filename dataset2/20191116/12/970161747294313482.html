      <h1>Gunmen open fire on buses carrying Muslims to vote in Sri Lankan election</h1>

      <p>Gunmen have opened fire on buses carrying Muslims to cast their ballots in the Sri Lankan presidential election.</p>
      <p>Attackers also threw stones and blocked more than a hundred vehicles with burning tires, according to a group monitoring election violence.</p>
      <p>Police officials confirmed the convoy of buses – carrying hundreds of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/muslim/">Muslim</a> residents from the north-west town of Puttalam – were hit on Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>There are no reported injuries and officers are investigating, said Manjula Gajanayake, spokesman for the Colombo-based Centre for Monitoring Election Violence.</p>
      <p>It is unclear whether any of the attackers have been arrested.</p>
      <p>The presidential election comes after 269 people were killed by Islamic extremists in a suicide bomb attack on Easter Sunday this year.</p>
      <p>Fears remain among minority Tamils and Muslims about a return to power of Gotabaya Rajapaksa, a hard-line former defence official under his brother, ex-President Mahinda Rajapaksa.</p>

      <p>The Elections Commission had encouraged Muslims – who fled their homes in the northern district of Mannar in 1982 when the separatist insurgency of Tamil rebels began to grow – to register to vote.</p>
      <p>However, they had not arranged enough transportation to bring them from their homes in the northwestern district of Puttalam, Mr Gajanayake claimed.</p>
      <p>Mr Rajapaksa had been expected to win over ruling party candidate Housing Minister Sajith Premadasa.</p>
      <p>However, the race appeared very close before voting day.</p>

      <p>President Maithripala Sirisena, who was elected in 2015, is not seeking re-election.</p>
      <p>Nearly 16 million of Sri Lanka’s 22 million population are eligible to vote to select a new president from a record 35 candidates.</p>
      <p>Results are expected as early as Sunday.</p>
