      <p>The script is ready, the cast is being listed, and it seems everything is in its place for the sequel of the 2005 comedy ‘No Entry’. However, director Anees Bazmee is yet to get the go ahead from producer Boney Kapoor.</p>
      <p>“We will make No Entry sequel. I have written a good script much bigger than the last one. It’s a good script and one of the best films I have written so far,” Deccan Chronicle reports the film maker explain.</p>
      <p>He went on to add, “But now, it depends on Boneyji to take the call about how we will take the film forward,” says Bazmee and reveals that the sequel will have much bigger cast. “In No Entry there were three actors but the new script has six actors in double role. There will be 10 girls instead of four.”</p>
      <p>Where the original starred Salman Khan, Anil Kapoor, Fardeen Khan, Bipasha Basu Grover, Esha Deol and Celina Jaitley, apparently the filmmaker wants to stick to the same cast. “I want the same cast in the sequel. I have done 11 films with Anil and Salman is always fun to work with. Fardeen did a good job in the film with all other actors,” Bazmee expressed.</p>
