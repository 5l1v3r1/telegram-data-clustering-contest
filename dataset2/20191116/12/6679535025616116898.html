      <p>Lack of illumination on Taramani – Perungudi –Velachery Link Road poses a risk to the motorists and the</p>
      <p>pedestrians after sunset.</p>
      <p>The stretch comes under the jurisdiction of Greater Chennai Corporation. The illumination from a few</p>
      <p>commercial establishments between Taramani and Perungudi railway station is the saving grace for the</p>
      <p>motorists and the pedestrians, S. Raman, a motorist, and a resident of Madipakkam, said.</p>
      <p>The worst affected are the pedestrians, who have to walk on the carriageway as the pavements along the</p>
      <p>Taramani- Perungudi Eri is dumped with trash and construction debris and unhygienic.</p>
      <p>To avoid getting caught in the traffic congestion during the rush hour in the evenings on Taramani – Velachery</p>
      <p>Link Road and Velachery Main Road, daily, countless number of motorists negotiate through the stretch at a</p>
      <p>good speed posing a risk to their counterparts. Adding to the woes of the motorists, lack of illumination and</p>
      <p>speed breakers is posing a challenge and troubling the motorists. On the contrary, the road along the two</p>
      <p>MRTS station is well lit.</p>
      <p>Given the capacity of vehicular traffic negotiating through the stretch after sunset, the Greater Chennai</p>
      <p>Corporation should take steps at the earliest to facilitate illumination facility on the stretch in the safety of</p>
      <p>road-users. Besides, at points on the stretch, speed breakers, reflectors and warning boards must be placed and</p>
      <p>installed to warn the undisciplined motorists, residents of Ezhil Nagar, Perungudi, said.</p>
