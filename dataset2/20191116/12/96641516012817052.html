      <p>In the latest installment of "things that will make you feel old," <i>Halo 2 </i>was released on November 9, 2004 -- which makes it 15 years old. <i>The Ringer </i>takes an in-depth look at the game's legacy, including how it made video games a shared experience and its lasting influence on things like streaming culture. Oh yeah, it was also the best-selling entertainment (not just gaming) release of all time when it debuted. Insane.</p>
