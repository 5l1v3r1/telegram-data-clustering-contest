      <p>A trending video has shown an angry man dressed in an Army camouflage on Saturday morning assaulting an official of the Lagos State Traffic Management Authorities (LASTMA) after he was challenged for allegedly disobeying traffic law.</p>
      <p>A Twitter user, who also shared the viral video that has been viewed for about 30,000 times, claimed the soldier drove along the BRT lane at Onipanu area of the city before he was flagged down by the traffic official.</p>
      <p>‘Na my motor, you can’t pass Ibadan…,’ the soldier said amidst his outburst as he made constant efforts to make telephone calls.</p>
      <p>Some other soldiers and policemen later joined the scene to calm the situation.</p>
      <p>Watch the video here:</p>

      <p>LASTMA spokesman, Olumide Filade, confirmed the incident to our correspondent.</p>
      <p>He added that “we got the cooperation of the Nigerian military and they are already taking actions on him. ”</p>
