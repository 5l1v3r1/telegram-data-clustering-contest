      <p>A D-Day veteran who took part in a secret reconnaissance mission to check out the Normandy beaches for the Allied forces is celebrating his 100th birthday.</p>
      <p>John Jenkins is marking his centenary with his family in his home city of Portsmouth.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, he received a standing ovation from the Queen and US President Donald Trump when he addressed heads of state during the D-Day 75 commemorations on Southsea Common.</p>

      <p>Describing being the centre of attention, Mr Jenkins said: "I've never been a nervous sort of person when faced by people of a higher rank because they are only human beings the same as I am."</p>
      <p>Despite reaching a century, Mr Jenkins said he does not "feel any different".</p>
      <p>"I think to myself 'how did I get here?' but there it is, time creeps up on you and before you know it you're in your 100th year, which is amazing really," he said.</p>

      <p>Mr Jenkins was awarded an MBE for his role as a Company Sergeant Major in the Territorial Army after the war. </p>
      <p>He said keeping fit is the secret to reaching 100.</p>
      <p>"I've always been a keen keep-fit chap, I always used to like PT at school," he said.</p>
      <p>"I became a physical training instructor in the Army, I also used to do a lot of amateur wrestling in my younger days so that kept me pretty fit."</p>
      <p>Mr Jenkins, who said football is a "big part" of his life, also keeps active through his role as boardroom steward at Portsmouth FC and as a volunteer at the D-Day Story museum.</p>
      <p>After leaving school, he became a bellboy for the Cunard cruise line in 1933 before he attempted to join the Royal Navy but was turned down because of his eyesight.</p>
      <p>He went on to join the Hampshire Regiment of the Army before moving to the Pioneer Corps, in which he served as a Platoon Sergeant during the Second World War.</p>
      <p>For his role in D-Day, Mr Jenkins was awarded the Legion d'Honneur - France's highest honour.</p>
      <p>Mr Jenkins said: "It's something you never forget. I landed on Gold Beach, someone said to me 'what did it feel like?' and I said 'it was terrifying', it was the only word I could think of at the time."</p>

      <p>His granddaughter, Alison Baynes, explained Mr Jenkins had also been involved in a secret mission to carry out a reconnaissance trip to the Normandy beaches ahead of the landings to take sand samples to select the appropriate landing sites.</p>
      <p>She said: "He was told to keep it a secret so he hadn't told anyone about it, not even his wife."</p>
      <p>Mr Jenkins went on to become a trolley bus driver after the war before working as a crane operator at Portsmouth Naval Base.</p>

      <p>In 2015, he became the oldest man to abseil down Portsmouth's Spinnaker Tower at the age of 95 and in 2012, he even carried the Olympic torch.</p>
      <p>In recent years, Mr Jenkins' volunteer work has been recognised.</p>
      <p>He was awarded Portsmouth Volunteer of the Year in 2016 and National Museum and Heritage Volunteer of the Year 2019.</p>
      <p>Mrs Baynes described her grandfather as a "remarkable man" who is "fiercely independent and a real inspiration".</p>
