      <h1>Jadon Sancho's reaction as supporter begs him to sign for Manchester United</h1>

      <p>Dortmund star Jadon Sancho gave a telling response as a supporter begged him to join <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> after an England training session.</p>
      <p>The winger earned his 11th cap for the Three Lions in their 7-0 mauling of Montenegro on Thursday and he’s likely to be involved again on Sunday against Kosovo.</p>
      <p>Sancho has been in good form for England but his club form has dipped and there’s been suggestions that he could leave in January after he was dropped and fined for being late for training.</p>
      <p>Manchester United were desperate to sign Sancho last summer and had been confident of doing so before their failure to qualify for the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/champions-league/">Champions League</a>.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils have retained their interest though and have even been linked with a January move for the 19-year-old.</p>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is keen on signing a right winger and Sancho is certainly the name on supporters’ lips, especially given his ties to Manchester City.</p>

      <p>And the reports were put directly to Sancho by a brazen supporter at one of England’s training sessions this week.</p>

      <p>The supporter says ‘Please sign for United’ after taking a selfie with the teenager and Sancho can be heard laughing as he diplomatically moves on.</p>
      <p>Sancho is believed to be keen on a return to the Premier League but United will face plenty of competition for his signature.</p>
      <p>Liverpool, City, Real Madrid and Barcelona have all monitored Sancho’s progress and Dortmund are likely to demand around £120m to let him go.</p>
