      <p>NAGPUR: The brilliant run of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kidambi-Srikanth">Kidambi Srikanth</a> came to an end in the semifinal of the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Hong-Kong-Open">Hong Kong Open</a> World Tour Super 500 badminton tournament at Hong Kong Coliseum on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Local hero <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Lee-Cheuk-Yiu">Lee Cheuk Yiu</a> ended Srikanth's bid to reach the first final of the year with a 21-9, 25-23 victory in 42 minutes. India's lone hope in the tournament, Srikanth squandered away seven game points to suffer a heart-breaking defeat.</p>
      <p>With this win, World No. 27 Lee avenged his earlier loss against Srikanth in the last year's India Open at New Delhi.</p>
      <p>It was a below par performance from Srikanth in the first game as he could not control the drift in the shuttles at the far end.</p>
      <p>The World No. 13 put up a far better performance in the second game. The 26-year-old Srikanth took an early 5-1 lead and was ahead 11-8 at the break. The Indian maintained his lead and had four game points at 20-16.</p>
      <p>However, the 23-year-old Lee reeled off four successive points to level the scores. Srikanth again had three game points to his credit but could not capitalize on them. Finally, Lee converted his second match point much to the jubilation of home crowd. Lee will face eighth seed Anthony Sinisuka Ginting, who eliminated sixth seed and Asian Games champion Jonatan Christie of Indonesia 22-20, 13-21, 21-18.</p>
      <p>Srikanth was disappointed after the close loss. "It was good match. I could not start well but I am happy with the way I played in the second game and should have won after leading 20-16. I am little disappointed with it but it's a game and things like these happen," Srikanth told TOI on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The former World No. 1 has left for Gwangju to compete in next week's Korea Masters tournament.</p>
      <p>"I want to forget this quickly and focus on my next tournament in Korea. Overall I am happy to reach semifinal in Hong Kong and looking forward to my next challenges," added Srikanth.</p>
