      <h1>Zigzagging white ramps encourage interaction at Huandao Middle School in China</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T12:00:10+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.dezeen.com/author/jon-astbury/" target="_blank">Jon Astbury</a></address>
      <p><a href="http://dezeen.com/tag/trace-architecture-office">Trace Architecture Office</a> designed zigzagging <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/ramps/">ramps</a> running round Huandao Middle School in Haikou, <a href="http://dezeen.com/tag/china">China</a>, to encourage interaction and play between students outside the classroom.</p>
      <p>Monolithic <a href="http://dezeen.com/tag/white">white</a> pillars surround the internal <a href="http://dezeen.com/tag/courtyards">courtyard</a> of the <a href="http://dezeen.com/tag/schools">school</a>, which sits within a dense residential area.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.t-a-o.cn/">Trace Architecture Office (TAO)</a>  said the design is intended "create a nurturing environment that celebrates creativity and interaction rather than examination-oriented learning cultures."</p>
      <p>A playground sits at the centre of the school along with a running track, with a teaching block and a dormitory facing each other across the open space.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>In order to maximise this outdoor area, the buildings are raised on <a href="http://dezeen.com/tag/stilts">pilotis</a> to allow the playground to become part of the ground floor level of Huandao Middle School.</p>
      <p>An inner courtyard sits at second floor level, providing another communal space sheltered from the sun and allowing natural ventilation to flow into the centre of the school.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Access to the courtyard is via a grand staircase that runs almost the entire length of the building.</p>
      <p>Huandao Middle School's accommodation occupies a long, thin slab block to the north, and the teaching block to the south has an angular plan surrounding the courtyard at its centre.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Classrooms are arranged along both sides of the teaching block, with those on the opposite side of the building area arranged as independent volumes, separated by wide circulation areas.</p>
      <p>This circulations blends into the <a href="http://dezeen.com/tag/ramps">ramps</a> and <a href="http://dezeen.com/tag/staircases">staircases</a> that connect the levels of the school and animate the facades, where they look down onto the playground.</p>

      <p>"Widened corridors form a series of interlaced, semi-open balconies that allow small groups of friends to observe and contemplate," explained the practice.</p>

      <p>"The zigzag ramps and stairs create more spaces for social interaction and also serve as vertical circulation."</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Music and dance classrooms have been given arched roofs, to improve their acoustics.</p>
      <p>At one end of the courtyard a tower with brightly-painted interiors provides a dramatic contrast to the predominantly white structure, creating a contemplative area illuminated by a skylight.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>In the accommodation block, the simpler facade is defined by the communal balconies from which the apartments are accessed.</p>
      <p>The stairwells have been clad with gridded panels to allow natural ventilation to travel through.</p>

      <p>To deal with its earthquake-prone location, the building's foundations have been fitted with a series of seismic isolators to absorb vibration.</p>
      <p>Trace Architecture Office was founded in 2009 by Hua Li. The practice recently completed a <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2019/02/15/trace-architecture-office-complete-xinzhai-coffee-manor-chinas-arabica-coffee-growing-region/">project combining a coffee processing facility with a hotel</a>, as well as a <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2019/09/08/bridge-house-tao-swan-lake-concrete-bridge-china-architecture/">visitor's centre housed in a concrete bridge above a wetland park.</a></p>
