      <p>Reliance Group chairman Anil Ambani on Friday resigned as the director of the bankrupt Reliance Communications (RCom). This follows the company's reported consolidated loss of ₹30,142 crore, the second highest in corporate India after Vodafone Idea.</p>
      <p>Chhaya Virani, Ryna Karani, Manjari Kacker and Suresh Rangachar have also resigned from the post of director, the company said in a filing to the Bombay Stock Exchange on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Company’s loss ballooned to ₹30,142 crore after provisioning for statutory licence fee and spectrum usage dues, versus a profit of ₹1,141 crore the year before.</p>
      <p>“The resignation of Manikantan V and appointment of D. Vishwanath as Executive Director and Chief Financial Officer has been put up to the Committee of Creditors [COC] for their approval. Upon approval, further disclosures will be made to stock exchanges. Since the company is under CIRP [Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process], the above resignations are being put before the COC members for their consideration,” said the statement.</p>
      <p>RCom had filed for insolvency under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) and has ₹47,000 crore as dues to the financial creditors.</p>
      <p>RCom shares on the BSE closed down 3.28% at 0.59 paisa on Friday, valuing the company at ₹<a href="tel:+4416317">163.17</a> crore.</p>
