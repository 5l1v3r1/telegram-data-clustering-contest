      <p>Cape Town - A New Zealand club rugby player has been banned for life after punching a referee during a match.</p>
      <p>According to the <b><a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=12285725">New Zealand Herald</a></b>, 28-year-old <b>Vaea Uelese</b> was playing for South Otago side Crescent against Strath Taieri on July 27 when he was sent off by referee Brandon Hale.</p>
      <p>Shortly after the game, the player was charged with assault but walked away without being convicted.</p>
      <p>The Otago Rugby Football Union confirmed on Friday that Uelese would not play rugby in New Zealand again.</p>
      <p>However, the Dunedin District Court confirmed that Uelese will be allowed to be involved in administration, officiating or coaching after the end of the 2020 season.</p>
      <p>This was partly due to a reconciliation process Uelese had with referee Hale, who told the Kiwi publication he has forgiven the player.</p>
