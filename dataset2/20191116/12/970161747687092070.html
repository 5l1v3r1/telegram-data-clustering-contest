      <p>Gary Neville admits he will never protest against the Glazer family and their ownership of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a>.</p>
      <p>The Glazers took control of United as part of a £790 million takeover in 2005 but the club have been saddled with a huge debt ever since.</p>
      <p>United supporters are now urging the Glazer family to sell following the club’s decline during their reign.</p>
      <p>But Neville believes that new owners could provide even more problems for United.</p>
      <p>‘Are they the worst owners in football? No. Are they the best? No,’ Neville said in an interview with <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/sport/gary-neville-are-the-glazers-the-best-owners-no-but-whats-the-alternative-06lx6fltp">The Times</a>.</p>

      <p>‘My biggest problem with the Glazer family over the past seven years is the campaign 2004-06 where Manchester United weren’t successful, Arsene Wenger came in with the Invincibles [Arsenal], Jose [Mourinho] came in [at Chelsea], that’s when there was a real hostility.</p>

      <p>‘All of a sudden in 2006 to 2012, where we were getting to three in four Champions League finals, and winning trophies, it went quiet.</p>
      <p>‘Then in 2014-15 when we started to get into a period of non-success again, it builds up again.</p>
      <p>‘The idea of screaming about the Glazers every ten minutes, saying they are not good owners, doesn’t get us anywhere.</p>
      <p>‘I’d love owners that pump every penny back into the club on to the pitch, that didn’t take out £20 million a year, or whatever they take out in debt against the club.</p>
      <p>‘But I can’t do anything about it. Just stand there and campaign and whinge? Stand on the front of Old Trafford in front of Best, Law and Charlton with my placard up saying ‘Glazers out?’</p>
      <p>‘I’m not going to do that because I haven’t got the solution.’</p>
