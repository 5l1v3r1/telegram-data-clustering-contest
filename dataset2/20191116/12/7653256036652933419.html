      <p>SABARIMALA: At least ten young women from <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Andhra-Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a>, who arrived at Pamba on Saturday to offer prayers at the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Lord-Ayyappa-temple">Lord Ayyappa temple</a> here, were sent back, police said.</p>
      <p>The women, in the 10-50 age group, were part of a 30-member group from Vijayswada.</p>
      <p>"After they reached Pamba, police checked their identity cards and found that they were in the barred age group and informed them about the current situation in <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Sabarimala">Sabarimala</a>.</p>
      <p>They did not proceed further," police said.</p>
      <p>The Pamba base camp is at the foothills of Sabarimala, about 5 km from the shrine.</p>
      <p>The Lord Ayyappa temple opened this evening for the two month long Mandala-Makaravillakku pilgrimage season.</p>
      <p>The state and temple precincts had witnessed protests by right wing outfits and BJP workers last year after the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/LDF-government">LDF government</a> decided to implement the Supreme court's verdict of September 28, 2018 allowing women of all age groups to offer prayers at the shrine.</p>
      <p>However, this year, even though the top court had not stayed its verdict on entry of young women into the shrine while posting various petitions on the matter to a larger bench, the government was exercising caution.</p>
      <p>Devaswom Minister <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Kadakampally-Surendran">Kadakampally Surendran</a> has made it clear that Sabarimala was not a place for activists to display their activism and said the government would not encourage such women who want to visit the shrine for publicity.</p>
