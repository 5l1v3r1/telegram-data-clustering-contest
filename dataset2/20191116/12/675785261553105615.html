      <h2>Romelu Lukaku admits he told Ole Gunnar Solskjaer he wanted to leave Manchester United in March, five months before completing his move to Inter Milan</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T12:59:17+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 12:59</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>Romelu Lukaku has claimed Ole Gunnar Solskjaer wanted him to stay at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> .</p>
      <p>Lukaku, 26, left United for Inter Milan in a £73m deal in the summer after falling down the pecking order under Solskjaer.</p>
      <p>The Belgian striker's absence has been felt with Marcus Rashford carrying the burden of being United's main attacking threat this season.</p>
      <p>After Lukaku's exit, Solskjaer suggested he 'happily' let him go, insisting: "Romelu's head was not here for us working forward as a group.</p>
      <p>"I have got lots of respects for Romelu but his time was up here."</p>

      <p>Lukaku has claimed Solskjaer wanted him to stick around but he was determined to leave, initially outlining his intentions to the United boss back in March.</p>
      <p>“Solskjaer has my eternal respect. He understood me when I said in March that it was time for me to leave," <a href="https://www.hbvl.be/cnt/dmf20191116_04719019/wij-kennen-geen-genade-meer">he told Het Belang van Limburg.</a></p>
      <p>“I have been in the Premier League as an 18-year-old boy and now I am 26. Solskjaer wanted to keep me, but I was ready for something new.”</p>

      <p>Lukaku has enjoyed a decent start to life in Milan, scoring nine times in 12 appearances.</p>
      <p>He has faced problems off the pitch though after being subjected to racial abuse from opposition supporters.</p>
      <p>Speaking ahead of Belgium's clash with Russia, he said: "I knew it would happen. I was prepared because I had spoken to other footballers about it.</p>
      <p>"But I'm having a good time in Italy. The people on the street are very good to me and it's on that, that I want to focus."</p>
