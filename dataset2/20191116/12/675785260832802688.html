      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T12:27:03+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 12:27</time> by <a rel="author">Emmeline Saunders</a></address>
      <p>Dan Osborne has got his hands full as his wife Jacqueline Jossa has jetted Down Under ahead of her I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! stint.</p>
      <p>The former TOWIE star, who was fired from the ITV reality show in 2015 <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/dan-osborne-sacked-towie-after-5561419">over threats to stab his ex-girlfriend</a> , put on a united front as he posed with his three children.</p>
      <p>In the topless snap, Dan snuggled up with his eldest son Teddy and his daughters Ella and Mia with Jac as they got used to life without their mum.</p>
      <p>"Morninggg not the best picture but this is us first thing in the morning, cuddles with daddy always first, then breakfast time," Dan captioned the shot.</p>

      <p>His former TOWIE co-star Mark Wright commented underneath: "V cute mate."</p>
      <p>New dad Dom Lever of Love Island fame also gushed: "Love this bro."</p>
      <p>And another follower joked, "Now mamas away, we need to see dad doing hair tutorials", to which Dan replied, "OK I'll give it a go", along with a crying-laughing emoji.</p>
      <p>It comes as ex-EastEnders star Jacqueline was spotted carrying out her first task for I'm A Celebrity: making her way to the snake and bug-infested jungle camp.</p>

      <p>She and the other stars - including Caitlyn Jenner, Ian Wright and Nadine Coyle - were seen arriving in mud-splattered 4x4s to a clearing in Australia's New South Wales before clambering into helicopters or canoes.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn and her Team Red buddy James Haskell were given a rickety canoe to get across to the other side of a river, while Team Yellow - Nadine Coyle and Adele Roberts - were tasked with jumping out of a helicopter.</p>
      <p>Ahead of her jungle stint, mum of two Jacqueline insisted it was <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/im-celebs-jacqueline-jossa-says-20862673">time for people to stop thinking of her as a pushover</a> , after several high-profile wobbles in her and Dan's marriage.</p>

        <figcaption>Jac and Dan got back together after their 2018 split</figcaption>

      <p>The pair temporarily split last year while Jac was heavily pregnant with Mia, and Dan moved out amid constant arguments before they later reconciled.</p>
      <p>"I think people think I am a pushover or a doormat," Jac commented this week.</p>
      <p>"I also think some people pity me. I want to show I am fine, I am up for a laugh and that I will go for it and try my best."</p>

      <p>And Jacqueline admitted she is going to struggle away from her two daughters during her jungle stint.</p>
      <p>The actress found it so difficult she didn't even explain to her children she was going to be on I'm A Celebrity.</p>
      <p>"I didn't know how to face even telling them. In the end, I thought the best idea was to say, 'Mummy is going away for work' and I would see them soon. My family is so close-knit and I will miss them all terribly," she added.</p>
