      <h1>This 10-year-old girl’s Christmas list is blowing people’s mind online</h1>
      <h2>Some of the requests were pretty standard at per with her age like dolls and bunnies but things went tad bit far when she included extravagant gifts like an iPhone 11 and a Macbook Air. And if that wasn't enough she cheekily also included whopping $4000 in her demands!</h2>

      <p>Christmas may be more than a month away but this little girl’s long list of items for the festive day has left all quite shocked online.</p>
      <p>Christmas wish-list put out by little children may be an innocent way to ask Santa for things they simply want as presents from parents, but this 10-year-old girl’s list with scores of expensive items has left people divided on Twitterverse.</p>
      <p>Some of the requests were pretty standard for her age such as dolls and bunnies but things went a bit far when she included extravagant gifts like an iPhone 11 and a Macbook Air. And if that wasn’t enough she cheekily also included whopping $4,000 in her list of demands!</p>
      <p>But what really baffled many online were items like “Gucci slides”, “Chanel purse” and a “Hydro Flask”!</p>

      <p>While most were amazed with her knowledge of fashion and make-up, others wondered what she was going to do with all that cash. While most were left in splits saying that her list is “goals” and they would totally use her list for their own, others reminisced about their childhood when the most expensive thing would probably be a Lego set or a video game.</p>
      <p>Here’s how people are reacting to the list:</p>
