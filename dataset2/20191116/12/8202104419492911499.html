      <h3>Just like our kids today</h3>
      <p>I found the article “<a href="https://nationalpost.com/news/world/u-k-researchers-taught-rats-to-drive-tiny-cars-by-rewarding-them-with-food">Rewarded with sugar, rats taught to drive</a>” (NP, Oct. 28) very interesting. It stated that rats held in a more stimulating environment with ‘various interesting objects’ keeping them active, actually had a greater ability to learn to drive a small vehicle around a rectangular track to a sugary cereal treat at the destination, then those kept in a cage. It did not mention anything about physical health after the sugary cereal treats.</p>
      <p>I see a correlation to today’s children and young people. If the only stimulation is from a screen and using their thumbs and the bulk of the rewards are sugary or fast foods … well then they have basically chosen their cage and a lower ability to learn and poorer health will surely follow.</p>

        <b>Trudeau reaching out to mayors</b>
      </p>
      <p>We had a national election on Oct. 21. We all know the outcome. A week later Prime Minister Trudeau reached out to western mayors to learn the concerns westerners have. Shouldn’t he have informed himself before the election?</p>
      <p>No wonder there is such a disconnect between Saskatchewan and Alberta and Ottawa. Trudeau’s actions say it all. He reaches out after the federal election. I can only shake my head.</p>

        <b>Taking IPCC out of context is no help</b>
      </p>
      <p>Geoff Galloway’s letter “<a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/opinion/letters/letters-to-the-editor-oct-31">Climate change cannot be predicted, only guessed</a>” (SP, Oct. 31) is a little bizarre.</p>
      <p>Galloway quotes the IPCC out of context to imply that there is no way of knowing if there is a climate crisis, but he ignores their recent and readily available special report urging strong and immediate action to keep warming to a modest 1.5 C.</p>
      <p>If the IPCC were not enough, on the day Galloway’s letter was published, the World Meteorological Organization issued a call to action, joining every scientific academy worldwide. The urgency of the crisis is now so great that many scientists feel that we have a moral duty to take radical action.</p>
      <p>Does Galloway really believe that among experts there is any argument that we are in a crisis? If so, it is because his mind is shut tight against real science.</p>
      <p>We in Saskatchewan and Alberta have profited magnificently from fossil fuels, and would like our profiting to continue, but at what expense? At the destruction of the life we hold so precious? Do you want to explain to your grandchildren that although the science was so settled in the 1990s as to lead to the Kyoto accord that 25 years later we were still pretending there is no problem?</p>
      <p>Climate change and many other aspects of global pollution need to be addressed, not ignored, for our sake and for the sake of our children.</p>
