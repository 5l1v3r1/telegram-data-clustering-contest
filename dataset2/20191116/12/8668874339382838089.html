      <h1>Gavin Henson says he'll take lie detector test over Gatland doping comments</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T12:07:19+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 12:07</time> by <a rel="author">By Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>Former Welsh playmaker Gavin Henson says he’s prepared to take a lie detector test following Warren Gatland’s comments about the suspected use of steroids by a Welsh player he previously coached.</p>
      <p>Gatland revealed he once had suspicions a player within the national squad may have taken drugs – but has no evidence anyone did under his tenure.</p>
      <p>Henson believes his former coach’s comments – made on an Irish sports’ podcast – need further investigation. Gatland took part in a wide-ranging discussion on the Off The Ball podcast, during which the subject of doping was brought up.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/wales">Wales</a> coach started with a general view on the issues, before then giving away some details of suspicions which came about from jokes made between team-mates.</p>
      <p>“The sad thing about professional sport, and whether it’s team sport or individual sport, when money’s involved, there’s that potential for it to be exploited with performance-enhancing drugs,” Gatland said.</p>

      <p>“I think we all want it to stay as clean as we possibly can.</p>
      <p>“I haven’t come across, personally, any players that I’ve coached from a Wales perspective that I would – well sorry, maybe one.”</p>
      <p>The former Wales boss added as he gave a short chuckle: “Yeah, maybe one, now that I think about it.”</p>
      <p>Asked if the person concerned had played for Wales, Gatland replied: “He may have done, yeah.”</p>

      <p>Pressed as to whether he had any misgivings about working with them, the former Wales coach moved to clarify his position.</p>
      <p>Asked if was more of a suspicion over possible doping, Gatland replied: “Yeah, absolutely… and that is the whole time I have been coaching Wales.</p>
      <p>Henson suggested that BBC Scrum V should carry out interviews using a lie detector. “BBC ScrumV you need to interview every player that played under Gats, a simple question – have you taken a performance enhancing drug? But strapped up to a lie detector.</p>
      <p>“It’ll take less than a minute! Let’s see who is up for it! I’m happy to be questioned. #canofworms”</p>

      <p>Gatland, 56, stepped down following the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/rugby-world-cup">Rugby World Cup</a> in Japan, where Wales reached the semi-finals before losing to <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/new-zealand">New Zealand</a> in the bronze medal match.</p>
      <p>The New Zealander had been in charge of Wales since 2007, guiding the squad to four <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations">Six Nations</a> titles as well as earning a place at the top of the world rankings.</p>
      <p>Gatland did suggest he felt the sport of rugby union, as a whole, was ‘clean’.</p>

      <p>“But I would like to think the sport is clean.</p>
      <p>“From a New Zealand perspective, I think it is pretty clean. When you go down levels we are seeing positives in Wales at junior levels and in other nations as well.</p>
      <p>“There’s always that temptation in players wanting to try and play at a higher level and taking the risks by taking drugs. I definitely don’t condone that.”</p>
      <p>Gatland continued: “It’s probably unfair of me to say I had suspicions because I’ve got no evidence or anything like that.</p>
      <p>“It’s kind of like just saying: ‘is there a possibility?’</p>

      <p>“It was more like a couple of people making jokes, sort of thing.”</p>
      <p>Asked if it was a case of ‘truth in humour?’, Gatland replied: “Yeah, exactly.”</p>
      <p>The Welsh Rugby Union declined to give any official comment when contacted by the PA news agency.</p>
      <p>It is understood the conversations Gatland recalled during the podcast came from when some Wales players were having a joke about one of their team-mates being in good shape.</p>
      <p>There were never any serious suspicions, because if there had been, the player concerned would have been reported and the relevant disciplinary procedures subsequently followed.</p>
