        <b>Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has reclaimed his position as the richest man in the world, knocking Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos off the throne once again. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The multi-billionaire philanthropist briefly took the top spot last month when Amazon reported a 28% drop in profits the three months ending in September, however Bezos soon climbed above again.</p>
      <p>Now Gates is back at number one with a net worth of $110 billion – and he’s there to stay, for now at least.</p>

      <p>The <i><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-15/gates-tops-bezos-as-world-s-richest-person-with-amazon-slide">Bloomberg</a> </i>Billionaire Index updates after US markets close, tracking the wealth of the richest 500 people across the globe.</p>
      <p>Gates’ rise above Bezos (who now has a net worth of $109bn), could be attributed to a recent Pentagon contract. Beating out Amazon, Microsoft signed a $10bn cloud-computing deal, prompting a surge in their shares – Amazon’s, however, dropped by about 2% after the announcement.</p>

      <p>Gates only owns around 1% of Microsoft shares. However, that equates to around $7.3bn, according to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-overtakes-jeff-bezos-as-worlds-richest-person-bloomberg-2019-11"><i>Business Insider</i></a> – this gave the Microsoft figurehead the boost over Bezos, with Microsoft’s shares increasing by 48% this year.</p>
      <p>Following Bezos’ split from his wife MacKenzie, his wealth was also took a hit. As part of their divorce settlement, she was given 19.7 million shares of Amazon.com valued at more than $38bn.</p>

      <p>Gates’ net worth could have been much higher over the years, but Bloomberg also reported that he has donated more than $35bn since 1994 through the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the recently proposed ‘wealth tax’ by Democratic presidential candidates, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, Gates said he’s already paid more than $10bn in taxes.</p>
      <p>
        <b>At <i>The New York Times</i> Dealbook conference, Gates said: </b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>If I’d had to pay $20bn, it’s fine. But when you say I should pay $100bn, then I’m starting to do a little math about what I have left over.</blockquote>
      <p>Gates also added that he wasn’t sure ‘how open minded [Warren] is… or that she’d even be willing to sit down with somebody who has large amounts of money’.</p>

      <p>However, in response, Warren recently said she’d love to explain the wealth tax to Gates.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Warren tweeted: </b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>I’m always happy to meet with people, even if we have different views. @BillGates, if we get the chance, I’d love to explain exactly how much you’d pay under my wealth tax. (I promise it’s not $100 billion.)</blockquote>
