      <p>Edwin van der Sar has signed a new long-term deal as Ajax chief executive, ending suggestions he could be Manchester United's new director of football.</p>
      <p>United are searching for a director of football with Van der Sar having been previously linked with the role.</p>
      <p>The former United keeper had said last month that he was <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/manchester-united/story/3964029/edwin-van-der-sar-on-manchester-united-role-of-courseim-interested">interested in the job</a>, but has now committed his future to Ajax until 2023.</p>
      <p>"Very happy with my contract extension at this beautiful club," Van der Sar said via <a href="https://twitter.com/vdsar1970/status/1195327569903652870?s=20">Twitter</a>. "I started as a goalie in 1991, 3 years ago I became Ajax CEO. We've had some difficult moments, but the good times are definitely back."</p>
