      <p>Takeaway shop manageress Tina Hassan gorged on the pizzas and kebabs she served and ballooned to a massive 22 dress size.</p>
      <p>Weighing in at a huge 18 stone 8 lbs she realised she needed to change her eating habits to get healthy.</p>
      <p>Suffering from daily migraines her doctor said it was her sheer weight that was the root to her symptoms.</p>
      <p>And she joined Slimming World in a bid to shed the pounds.</p>

      <p>Now the 39-year-old has reached her target weight of 11 stone 13 lbs and is now down to a slinky size 12.</p>
      <p>“It is so difficult working in the takeaway shop and serving the pizzas I loved but I do resist them now and think of the healthy recipes I can cook the Slimming World way,” said Tina, of Shiremoor, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/north-tyneside">North Tyneside.</a></p>
      <p>For six years Tina has worked in the Route 66 takeaway in<a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/shiremoor"> Shiremoor </a>and grew partial to the foods she dished out. But it was her unhealthy lifestyle that caused her severe migraines.</p>
      <p>She added: “I was suffering constant migraines on a daily basis and was hiding in the house because of them but also because of my low self confidence and my weight. I didn’t like how I looked and realised I had to do something about it.</p>
      <p>“It was the doctor at the hospital that said my weight was causing strain on my body. I had bad knees, a bad back and hips and that was the cause of the migraines. But now my aches and pains have all gone and I only get the occasional migraine, which I can cope with. I feel brilliant.”</p>

      <p>Tina now works out in the gym and has swapped the fatty foods for healthy options.</p>
      <p>“I’ve even figured out that the chicken kebabs with salad and chilli sauce we sell aren’t that fattening so I can have one of these now and again.</p>
      <p>“Before I never ate a vegetable and now my favourite is broccoli. I have dry fried broccoli with Cajun spice and I love it. I’ll eat dry fried vegetables with a low fat yogurt dip, you feel really good about yourself when you are doing it.”</p>
      <p>Mum-of-one Tina now is addicted to clothes shopping and visits Manchester regularly for retail trips with 19-year-old son Arron.</p>

      <p>“I like shopping more than him now, I’ve got three wardrobes full of clothes. Aaron is very proud of me as I am of him. He’s training to be a chef and he’s seen how healthy food has helped me.”</p>
      <p>Tina is winning compliments from her takeaway customers as they comment on her weight loss.</p>
      <p>“I love my job and have some fantastic customers, lots of which have noticed and mentioned the weight loss, which is lovely. I was definitely addicted to pizzas, kebabs and crisps but now I know how to cook things a healthy way,” added Tina.</p>
      <p>“I’m nearly 40 years of age and never knew how to cook things this way and I now love what I eat. I’m still amazed and proud of myself, I did it.”</p>
