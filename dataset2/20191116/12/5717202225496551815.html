      <h1>Robbie Fowler comments on Liverpool manger Jurgen Klopp</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T12:45:55+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 12:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/dom-toner/" target="_blank">Dom Toner</a></address>
      <p>Robbie Fowler has discussed the immense impact of manager Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool, as his team are the frontrunners in the Premier League title race.</p>
      <p>The Merseyside giants have 11 wins and one draw from their opening 12 Premier League games, which means they are running away with it at the top of the table.</p>
      <p>Leicester City and Chelsea are the closest to them sat eight points behind, while fourth-placed Manchester City are nine point adrift.</p>
      <p>Klopp’s team did win the Champions League last season, but ultimately ended up a point short to Premier League holders Manchester City and want to go one better now.</p>
      <p>The Reds are once again starting to look like a force in English football and there is no doubt that the German boss has played a pivotal role.</p>
      <p>Since joining in 2015, he’s managed to build one of the best teams in Europe that are defensively resilient and breathtaking at times in attack.</p>
      <p>Liverpool legend Fowler has raved about Klopp and believes he’s a perfect match with the club’s identity.</p>
      <p>“For the generation of fans who have never seen Liverpool win the title, there is a sense that Jurgen is giving the club its pride back,” <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/jurgen-klopp-helping-liverpool-reclaim-20890480">Fowler told the Mirror</a></p>
      <p>“He knows what he is doing. He understands the touchstone for success is straight from Bill Shankly’s philosophy: He wants to make the people happy.</p>
      <p>“That means playing the right way – whether it’s called rock and roll football, heavy metal football or whatever – with a work ethic that gives his team a realistic chance of winning. He recognises that success on the pitch has to be earned and is not a God-given right.”</p>

        <b>TBR’s View:</b>
      </p>
      <p>There is no doubt that Klopp understands the magnitude of football in Liverpool and he’s a dream candidate for the manager’s position at Anfield.</p>
      <p>It’s no surprise that he’s adored by the Reds supporters and he already seems a club icon after European success, but a first Premier League crown would cement his legacy.</p>
      <p>His team are in such a strong position to win a first top-flight since 1990, but the second they take their eye off the ball teams behind them could pounce.</p>
      <p>Liverpool face Crystal Palace and Brighton in their next two league games, which should be a brilliant opportunity to rack up another six points.</p>
