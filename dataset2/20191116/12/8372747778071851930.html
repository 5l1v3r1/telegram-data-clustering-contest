      <p>PLEASANTVILLE, N.J. – Five men have been arrested in connection with a Friday night shooting at a New Jersey high school football game.</p>
      <p>Three people were struck by the gunfire, including a 10-year-old who is listed in critical condition, a 15-year-old boy who suffered a graze wound, and a 27-year-old man who is in stable condition and will undergo surgery, according to the Atlantic County Prosecutor's Office.</p>
      <p>Video shows football players and attendees scrambling after shots rang out. People could be seen hopping fences, diving under bleachers and lying down on the field as the chaos unfolded.</p>
      <p>Gun Shots fired at the South Jersey High School Football playoff game at Pleasantville.</p>
      <p>Multiple people reported injured, including a young boy.</p>
      <p>Pleasantville &amp; Camden Players, coaches as well as Fans were running for safety.</p>
      <p>Alvin Wyatt, 31, is the man accused of opening fire at the game. He’s being charged with three counts of attempted murder, unlawful possession of a weapon, and possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose.</p>
      <p>Four other men at the game have been connected to the shooting. They’ve been identified as 27-year-old Michael Mack, 28-year-old Tyrell Dorn, 27-year-old Shahid Dixon, and 26-year-old Vance Golden.</p>
      <p>After the shooting, the prosecutor’s office says the four men fled in a vehicle from the Absecon Police Department into Atlantic City. While entering the city, one of the passengers allegedly threw a gun out of the vehicle.</p>
      <p>In the end, the four men were arrested on charges of unlawful possession of a weapon, and certain persons not to possess a weapon, according to the prosecutor’s office. Dixon is also being charged with eluding.</p>
      <p>“I want to thank the Pleasantville Police Department and the scores of off duty emergency personnel that assisted the victims and helped law enforcement promptly identify and locate those responsible for causing mayhem at the Pleasantville High School football game,” said Atlantic County Prosecutor Damon G. Tyner. “Unlike some of the shootings that have occurred on school premises throughout the country, this incident had nothing to do with the students of Pleasantville High School or Camden High School. The venue simply presented an opportunity for criminals to pursue their own form of petty vengeance against one another. As a result, an innocent child was caught and injured in their crossfire. Our community will not be held hostage by a few idiots intent on jeopardizing our safety and the safety of our children.”</p>
