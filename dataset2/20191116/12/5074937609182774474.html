      <h1>Intensify awareness on warning signs of diabetes </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T12:13:41+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 12:13</time> by <a rel="author">Dennis Peprah, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Sunyani, Nov. 15, GNA – The Ghana Coalition of NGOs in Health (GCNH), has called on civil society actors to support the Ghana Health Service to intensify awareness creation on warning signs of diabetes, as the world marks the 2019 World Diabetes Day.</p>
      <p>The need to create a day for the awareness of diabetes came in response to growing concerns about the escalating health threats from the disease.</p>
      <p>The day, first instituted in 1991 provides a platform to promote advocacy efforts throughout the year.</p>
      <p>In an interview with the Ghana News Agency (GNA), Ms. Evelyn Bema Darkwa, the Bono, Bono East and Ahafo Regional Chairperson of the GCNH, said diabetes was a life threatening disease responsible for several deaths in the country and expressed regret that education on diabetes was low compared to other communicable diseases.</p>
      <p>Ms Darkwa stated left untreated or managed, diabetes could lead to life changing complications - blindness, amputation, kidney failure, heart attack and stroke.</p>
      <p>The theme for this year’s celebration is “Family and Diabetes” which focuses on raising awareness of the impact that diabetes had on the family and support network of those affected.</p>
      <p>Ms Darkwa advised Ghanaians to stay safe by checking and controlling their eating habits and do regular physical exercises.</p>
      <p>She underlined the need for concerted and broader efforts to raise awareness on the impact that diabetes had on the family and support networks of the affected, and promote the role of the family in the management, care, prevention and education of diabetes.</p>
