      <p><i>Getaran Jiwa</i> is a song that any Malaysian can relate to and one that resonates in our hearts.</p>
      <p>The song, penned and performed by Malaysian actor, singer and songwriter Allahyarham Tan Sri P Ramlee, has seen its fair share of renditions being belted out through the years by fans here as well as overseas.</p>
      <p>Understanding that there are different styles of how the song is sung today, what one netizen came across whilst strolling the streets of Melbourne, Australia could be the best rendition yet.</p>
      <p>Shared by Facebook page <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=485151852086954">Era (Malaysia)</a>, here is the video of the lovely couple serenading others with their beautiful music.</p>

      <p>Beautiful right!?</p>
      <p>The video has taken Malaysia by storm and has been shared across various social media platforms, giving a sign that P Ramleeâ€™s legend lives on!</p>
      <p>Here is a little history lesson about the song â€“ written by S. Sudarmaji the song was sung by Allahyarham P Ramlee when he acted the role of Sazali in the film <i>Antara Dua DarjatÂ </i>(1960).</p>
