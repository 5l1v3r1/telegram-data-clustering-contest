      <h1>Why there's currently a hippopotamus on Level 4 of BALTIC</h1>
      <h2>Animals are to the fore in a big winter exhibition at the Centre for Contemporary Art. David Whetstone spoke to Animalesque curator Filipa Ramos</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T12:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">David Whetstone</a></address>
      <p>Plenty of puzzling creations have been shown at BALTIC over the years, but there’s no mistaking the snoozing hippopotamus on Level 4.</p>
      <p>The great beast, comically spreadeagled, is the centrepiece of a noisy and colourful new exhibition called Animalesque - Art Across Species and Beings, which looks at the animal kingdom and our place in it.</p>
      <p>A version of the exhibition was shown earlier this year in Sweden. Curator Filipa Ramos says some things, like <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-upon-tyne">Newcastle-based </a>Chris Watson’s animal recordings which add to the zoo-like cacophony, have been added and others taken away.</p>
      <p>But there is a lot to see and hear in an exhibition which seems certain to appeal to all ages (hence the busy education programme attached to it).</p>

      <p>Hope Hippo has featured in both showings, although <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/gateshead">the Gateshead </a>hippo will differ minutely from the Swedish version and from the original that was shown at the prestigious Venice Biennale in 2005.</p>
      <p>In each location the hippo has been reconstructed in clay to the specifications of artists Jennifer Allora and Guillermo Calzadilla, from the United States and Cuba respectively.</p>
      <p>It’s not just a sculpture. Periodically throughout each day, a <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/baltic-centre-for-contemporary-art">BALTIC </a>staff member will mount the hippo, leaf through a newspaper and blow a whistle whenever an article causes upset or alarm.</p>
      <p>“When they first made this work, I think they were trying to mock the tradition of monumental public sculpture,” says Filipa. “Instead of having someone on an elegant metal horse, they decided to have this bulky sleeping hippo.”</p>
      <p>But the artists, she explains, were also playing with the idea of whistleblowing – not quite as widely understood in 2005 as now, when whistleblowers are exposing all kinds of uncomfortable truths.</p>

      <p>These are turbulent times and since they are reported daily in our newspapers, that whistle should be heard a lot at BALTIC in the coming months. But will it wake the sleeping giant beneath?</p>
      <p>With daily dire warnings about our climate and the natural world, Animalesque seems topical.</p>
      <p>But Filipa says: “This is not an apocalypse exhibition about the end of nature and how it is going through a huge crisis, but more an invitation to rethink our place in the world and our relationship with other life forms.”</p>
      <p>Its contribution to saving species and the planet we live on is more subtle than scaremongering. Many of the exhibits will make you smile; even fill you with wonder.</p>
      <p>A wall of brightly coloured squares, each bearing an emoji-like symbol called a lexigram, is the work of Amalia Pica (born in Argentina, based in London) who was artist-in-residence at the Gashaka Primate Project in Nigeria.</p>

      <p>The piece is called Yerkish which is also the name of a language, developed in the 1970s, which enables great apes such as chimpanzees and bonobos – similar to chimps in appearance – to communicate with man.</p>
      <p>The apes learned that by indicating a lexigram they would be rewarded with a particular human response and also demonstrated that they could pass this knowledge on to others.</p>
      <p>“One of the chimps at the research station, when she wanted to go outside and play, would indicate Please, Open, Hurry,” laughs Filipa.</p>
      <p>The Yerkish-inspired Pica piece contains a greeting for visitors to the exhibition. If you’re a chimp, you might be able to understand it.</p>
      <p>Of the several screen-based exhibits, the one most likely to appeal to children is French artist Pierre Bismuth’s The Jungle Book Project from 2002.</p>

      <p>It is a complete screening of the famous 1967 Disney animation but with a difference. The soundtrack is a compilation taken from 19 foreign language versions of the film so each of the characters speaks a different language.</p>
      <p>Mowgli speaks Spanish, Baloo Hebrew and Bagheera Arabic. Elephants speak German, French and Greek, a wolf speaks Czech and the chimps chatter in Korean. The English speaker is Shere Khan, the tiger, voiced here – as in the original film – by British actor George Sanders.</p>
      <p>An array of the artist’s own cartoon versions of the characters with their allotted language is also on display.</p>
      <p>Filipa says: “He looked at all the different versions of The Jungle Book and decided to create a Tower of Babel version so only if you can speak 19 languages will you be able to understand the film.</p>
      <p>“It’s bringing back the incomprehensibility of the animals, so we don’t understand any more what they’re saying.”</p>
      <p>Will children mind or even notice? With their comfort in mind, an array of coloured cushions has been laid in front of the screen.</p>
      <p>Marcus Coates, an artist who has worked a lot in the North East and is inspired by wildlife, collaborated with primatologist Volker Sommer to produce a piece with a very long title.</p>

      <p>Degreecoordinates, Shared Traits of the Hominini (Humans, Bonobos and Chimpanzees) is a list of questions to which all the related creatures mentioned in that title could feasibly answer yes.</p>
      <p>Some are nice or at least OK – Do you hug? Can you wade in water? Do you climb trees? Others – Do you throw rocks? Do you eat soil? Do you eat your own vomit? – are less appealing.</p>
      <p>A noticeable feature of the exhibition is the number of women artists whose work, over many decades in some cases, has looked at the ways human and animal behaviour overlaps.</p>
      <p>“This isn’t a show about feminism but I thought it was interesting to bring these artists together,” explains Filipa.</p>
      <p>She points out the beauty and intricacy of Britta Marakatt-Labba’s embroidery. The artist, born in 1951 into a Sami reindeer herding family in the north of Sweden, blends landscape, animals and mythology in her work, along with a subtle dash of politics.</p>
      <p>The BALTIC pieces would grace anyone’s living room wall, particularly in this chilly season, but Filipa says Britta also spent a few years creating an epic, 60-foot work showing the history of the Sami people (more frequently referred to in this country as Laplanders).</p>
      <p>Then there’s the extraordinary frieze of collage drawings created between 1972 and 2011 by American artist Mary Beth Edelson. More than 100 of them are arranged on the gallery’s far wall.</p>
      <p>Beautiful from afar, they merit a range of responses when examined up close. The artist, we learn, pays tribute to women across history, their achievements and their various struggles.</p>
      <p>Among famous faces you might see here, incorporated into strange creatures which are either goddess-like or more like creepy crawlies, are the singer Grace Jones, the actors Elizabeth Taylor and Sigourney Weaver and the artists Louise Bourgeois and Yoko Ono.</p>
      <p>“Women-animal-spirits” they are called in the BALTIC programme. Filipa and a couple of gallery technicians spent a very long time assigning them a place on the wall and pinning them up.</p>
      <p>Visitors intrigued by these female artists who maybe haven’t enjoyed the profile of their male counterparts, will also want to see the other new exhibition at BALTIC, the first major UK survey of the work of American artist Judy Chicago who turned 80 this year.</p>
      <p>Both the Judy Chicago exhibition and Animalesque: Art Across Species and Beings run until April 19 next year.</p>
      <p>An Animalesque event at BALTIC on January 25 will feature artists Amalia Pica and Marcus Coates and Volker Sommer, professor of evolutionary anthropology at University College London. Find details at Baltic.art</p>
