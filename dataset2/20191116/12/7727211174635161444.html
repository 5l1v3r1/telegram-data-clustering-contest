      <h1>What ITV I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here's Kim Woodburn looked like young</h1>
      <h2>"My loves, if you’ve got it, flaunt it!" - and it seems she always has</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T12:58:57+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 12:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/rebecca-koncienzcy/" target="_blank">Rebecca Koncienzcy</a></address>
      <p>Kim Woodburn has quite a cult following that has been amplified a little more this year when she signed up to <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> .</p>
      <p>Fans were blown away recently when the 77-year-old <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/kim-woodburn-shows-toned-legs-17235005">posted a snap of her toned legs</a> as she said: "My loves, if you’ve got it, flaunt it! (And I’ve got it in truck loads!)"</p>
      <p>Many of her 22,000 followers commented under the photo of her in a white gown that she had hitched up top reveal her tanned pins.</p>
      <p>One, @BeckijoArcher said: "That you have Kim, that you have! Flaunt it sexy lady."</p>
      <p>The original cleaning queen has always liked to 'flaunt it' as is evident from her secret modelling past in Liverpool.</p>
      <p>The How Clean Is Your House star was born in Portsmouth but later moved to Merseyside and is believed to have lived on Bagot Street in  <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/wavertree">Wavertree</a> .</p>
      <p>After numerous jobs working in children’s homes, in retail, and as a social worker helping teenage girls in the city, the star - then known as Patricia McKenzie - embarked on a modelling career, doing jobs for Littlewoods in the late 1960s.</p>

      <p>In 1983, Kim appeared on TV show Pebble Mill at One, demonstrating knitwear, but her brush with fame was short-lived and she went on to work as a professional house cleaner in the UK and US.</p>

      <p>In 2003, Kim became a household name when she co-presented Channel 4’s How Clean Is Your House, with Aggie MacKenzie. The show saw the pair make the nation’s grubbiest homes habitable once more and was a big hit, with Kim reportedly becoming the highest paid female presenter on Channel 4 at the time.</p>
      <p>She went to the Australian jungle in 2009 to compete in ITV's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! finishing as a runner-up to winner Gino D'Acampo.</p>

      <p>In 2017, she appeared on Celebrity Big Brother where she was centre of a number of iconic moments, including being temporarily removed from the Big Brother house by a security team after an explosive row with Danielle Lloyd's ex-husband <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/jamie-ohara-admits-hes-sexually-12467814">Jamie O'Hara</a> , in which she screamed: "You adulterer, that two-timed your wife and she’s got three kids. These people, they put me through hell.”</p>

      <p>It was during her time on the reality show that her on-going feud with Loose Women pannelist Coleen Nolan began.</p>
      <p>Kim made no secret that she did CBB for the money and came third, with Coleen winning the show.</p>
      <p>After watching the footage back, the How Clean Is Your House? star did not think Coleen was a worthy winner, and felt she had been bullied by her fellow contestants.</p>
      <p>This lead to an explosive appearance on Loose Women 18 months later in in August 2018.</p>
      <p>After the interview spiralled, Kim called Coleen 'trash', then stood up in tears and walked off the set, while the panel said she had "shown her true colours".</p>
      <p>It lead to a number of Ofcom complaints suggesting Kim was bullied on the show and a petition was launched to remove Coleen.</p>
      <p>Since then Kim has put the disagreement behind her and, to the delight of her fans, is now flogging merchandise with some of her best-love catchphrases on.</p>
      <p>Recently, Kim praised Liverpool drag queen The Viviene for her impression of the cleaning guru on RuPaul's Drag Race.</p>

      <p>The Scouse queen is well-known for her impressions and won a round on the reality show playing Donald Trump, but she regularly slips into a bit of Kim on the BBC Three show.</p>
      <p>Retweeting The Viviene's impersonation, Kim said: "What an wonderful impression by @THEVIVIENNEUK very flattered!"</p>
