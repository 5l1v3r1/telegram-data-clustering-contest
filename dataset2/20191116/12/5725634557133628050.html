      <h1>Weekly Economic Release Summary: Watching The Deteriorating Transport Data</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T12:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Steven Hansen</a></address>
      <p>Summary</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sea container data continues to decline.</li>
        <li>The CASS Freight Index is in contraction and indicating a recession is near,.</li>
        <li>If nothing else, the U.S. is in a goods recession.</li>
        <li>This post reviews all the economic releases this past week.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>During the last 30 days, I have passed through the Panama Canal twice. My observation was that the container ships going through both the old and new locks were lightly loaded.</p>
      <p>I have gone through the Panama Canal every few years beginning in 1973. These lightly loaded container ships seemed unusual.</p>
      <p>Part of the problem is that the Gatun Lake level is down from lack of rain. This lake not only is part of the canal but provides the water for the operation of the locks. The maximum draft has been reduced a good seven feet from the design draft of 50 feet for the new locks. <a href="https://www.joc.com/port-news/panama-canal-news/panama-canal-draft-restrictions-limiting-container-ship-loadings_20190507.html">This translates to an approximate 10% reduction</a> in cargo-carrying capacity for the vessels using the new locks.</p>
      <p>Another issue that the rates for the new locks were initially set too high, and have been significantly reduced within the last year to be competitive with the Suez Canal. It seems too many Neopanamax and Panamax vessels from South Asia to east coast U.S. ports were using the Suez Canal and avoiding the Panama Canal.</p>
      <p>As coincidence would happen, the container counts for the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach were released during the crossing and showed a significant decline again pushing the year-over-year data deeper into contraction.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Now compare the above graph with U.S. import and export data (graph below). Container counts from the Ports of LA and Long Beach continue to correlate with import data. And the port data is released a month earlier than the trade data from the US Census.</p>

      <p>Some pundits think that the new Panama Canal locks have affected the West Coasts container counts - <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4257414-weekly-economic-release-summary-new-panama-canal-locks-affect-usa-transport-analysis">our analysis is that there is little impact</a>. Too many market thumpers are trying to talk down the falling LA port data - they are wrong on a variety of levels but the fact remains that the data correlates with other traffic data.</p>
      <p>Econintersect has been alerting its readers that transport has been behaving poorly - and that correlates with a weak economy. The CASS Freight Index (which covers truck, ship, and air freight) has been in contraction now for 11 months - and it too is warning of a very weak economy. Its October 2019 index has contracted 5.9 % year-over-year.</p>

      <p>A quote from their October report:</p>
      <blockquote>With the -5.9% decline in October, following the string of declines in May through September (ranging from -3.0% to -6.0%), we repeat our message from the previous five months: the shipments index has gone from "warning of a potential slowdown" to "signaling an economic contraction."</blockquote>

          <b>Economic Forecast</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>The <i>Econintersect </i>Economic Index (<a href="http://econintersect.com/pages/releases/permalink.php?dog=101">November 2019</a>) forecast fell marginally again this month and continues to show the lowest level of growth since the economic slowdown in 2016. The continuing weakness of manufacturing, transport, and exports/imports continues to weigh on our economic forecast.</p>
      <p>The fundamentals which lead job growth are now showing a significant slowing growth trend in the employment growth dynamics. We are currently predicting the jobs growth to be below the growth needed to maintain participation rates and the employment-population ratios at the current levels.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <i>The Producer Price Index for final demand increased 0.4 percent in October, seasonally adjusted, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Final demand prices fell 0.3 percent in September and edged up 0.1 percent in August. (See table A.) On an unadjusted basis, the final demand index advanced 1.1 percent for the 12 months ended in October, the smallest rise since a 1.1-percent increase in the 12 months ended October 2016.</i>

Our primary monitoring tool - the 3-month rolling averages for sales - improved. As the monthly data has significant variation, the 3-month averages are the way to view this series. Overall business sales are better than the low point in 2015 - but are well below average for the values seen in the last 2 years. Note that inflation-adjusted sales are marginally in expansion.</td>
