      <h1>Need for Speed Heat review: Lukewarm thrills in this generic open world racer</h1>
      <h2>This passable instalment of the driving game franchise doesn't offer as much speed or heat its title suggests</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T12:00:59+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">JC Suttun, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jc-suttun/</a></address>
      <p>Released with little build-up or hype, Need for Speed: Heat is the latest entry in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/electronic-arts-inc">EA’s</a> long-running racing franchise, and it’s fair to say that the experience, temperature wise, is more on the tepid end of the scale.</p>
      <p>Like most of its recent forebears, Heat is an open world affair, taking place in the Miami-inspired fictional locale of Palm City. You step into the shoes of an aspiring street racer who falls in with Ana, a racing crew leader without a crew. The police’s specialised High Speed Task Force has begun a strict crackdown on the petrolheads, and some of these officers may have a hidden, unscrupulous agenda of their own.</p>

      <p>Advancing the plot involves taking part in story missions, usually unlocked by reaching thresholds of ‘Cred’ and ‘Bank’, the game’s cringeworthy labels for XP and money respectively. These are earned by way of Heat’s most (and only) interesting feature. Gameplay is split between day and night, each with different events spread across drifting, off-road and straightforward street race categories. There’s no traditional in-game day/night cycle though, as you simply switch between the two in the menus or when using a garage.</p>
      <p>During the day, ‘legal’ races will earn you Bank, and the police tend to ease off a bit. Night time ‘illegal’ races earn you Rep, and you can rack up even more by getting involved in police chases. Getting more attention from the five-o increases your multiplier, but if you get busted before making it to a safehouse then all the Rep you’ve earned that night is lost. Yes, a bit like Dark Souls.</p>

        <figcaption>Everything feels more thrilling during the night time portions</figcaption>

      <p> </p>
      <p>This adds a certain thrill to the after dark segments as you juggle staying out and causing trouble to level up with the threat of ending up empty handed if the cops get the better of you. The pull of doing just one more race or baiting patrol cars into a high speed pursuit before a desperate dash home makes taking to the roads at night a more appealing proposition compared to the relatively pedestrian proceedings of the day.</p>
      <p>However, this is pretty much the extent of any innovation. The neat approach to accruing XP aside, Heat is a formulaic experience that is practically indistinguishable from most of the Need for Speed titles of recent years.</p>

      <p>I mean, the game looks pretty, with some lovely vehicle modelling and weather effects. There’s also the usual array of customisation options, letting you purchase new parts to improve performance and tune your motor, be it to your own specific tastes or for specialising in off-roading or drifting etc. If you just want your car to look all fancy, you’ll find plenty of paints and decals on offer, along with the ability to download designs created by other players.</p>
      <p>But Palm City itself feels flat and empty, especially during the day. In terms of handling, everything is just…OK. In trying to take the middle ground between the realism of the Forza series and the arcade style of the Burnout titles, the end result here is functional yet stiff, lacking the devil-may-care exhilaration of the latter and the believable simulation of the former. The sense of speed is a tad underwhelming and jumps are half hearted, but your car is somehow able to plough through lamp posts, concrete dividers and 90% of the city’s trees as if they were made out of cardboard.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>There’s a semblance of multiplayer, in that the main menu gives you the choice of playing online or playing solo. The online option allows other players to appear in your instance of Palm City, with the ability to challenge them to races. But there’s no real meat here if you’re looking to really get to grips with other human racers, especially when compared to, say, the comprehensive multiplayer suites in the most recent Forza Horizon games.</p>

      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>Need for Speed: Heat is a perfectly functional and serviceable <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/video-games">open world racer</a> , and if you haven’t played one in a while you could certainly do far worse. Its novel, mildly Dark Souls-y take on levelling up offers a nice level of tension during the admittedly more engaging night time segments, and losing a convoy of angry cops after leading them on a wild goose chase is always satisfying. It’s not an ugly game either, with the detailed cars and slick wet roads of humid Palm City looking impressive, at least on the PS4 version tested.</p>
      <p>But, it is the very definition of generic, with the tired, Fast and Furious lite, underground street racer motif we’ve seen dozens of times before.</p>
      <p>Heat fails to stand out from similar franchises, and joins the ranks of the more forgettable Need for Speed entries. There’s some measure of fun to be had here, but it’s clear that the series needs a shot of nitrous in the tank if it wants to stay relevant.</p>
