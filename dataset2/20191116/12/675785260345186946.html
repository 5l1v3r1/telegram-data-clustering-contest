      <p>A former driving instructor caused £3,000 of damage when he reversed his car into the front of a Derby takeaway.</p>
      <p>Wayne White, 32, had had a furious row with a man inside the Big Taste Caribbean Restaurant.</p>
      <p>Their dispute spilled outside where he got into his car and started driving backwards towards the other man, reports <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/">Derbyshire Live.</a></p>
      <p>As he did so his car then collided with the front of the takeaway.</p>
      <p>At the time White, of Littleover, had been teaching driving lessons and was working towards passing his final exams.</p>
      <p>But that employment came to an end as a result of the conviction.</p>

      <p>After having his sentence deferred for six months at Derby Crown Court following his original hearing in June, White has now had an eight-month jail term suspended for a year.</p>
      <p>Judge Jonathan Bennett said: “This was a serious event and when we last met here I told you custody was at the forefront of my mind.</p>
      <p>“On that day I deferred the sentence and set you targets.</p>
      <p>“One was to save up compensation and you have paid that directly to the victims.</p>
      <p>“And one thing that also influenced me was your employment.</p>
      <p>“I understand you have lost your employment as a driving instructor but you have got some other employment.”</p>

      <p>Derbyshire Police confirmed that the incident took place between noon and 1.30pm on March 21, 2018.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman said: “Following an altercation inside the Big Taste Caribbean restaurant, in Normanton Road, a man got into a car and reversed it into the establishment causing damage.”</p>
      <p>White, of Littleover, was charged with a number of offences and pleaded guilty to affray.</p>
      <p>The other charges have been dropped.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the June hearing, Judge Bennett said: "This affray was a serious incident and saw you use unlawful violence against another outside a takeaway.</p>
      <p>"You had a bit of trouble inside with someone, I don’t know what it was about, but you came out, and got in your car.</p>
      <p>"He came out and caused some damage to your car and at that point you committed the affray.</p>
      <p>“You reversed the car and fortunately there was no injury to that man but you caused substantial damage to the establishment.</p>

      <p>"The proprietors of that establishment have been a little reluctant to come to court but I have heard figures banded about of £2,500 to £3,000 of damage."</p>
      <p>As well as the suspended sentence White was ordered to carry out 150 hours unpaid work, pay an additional £300 compensation and £300 towards the prosecution costs.</p>
