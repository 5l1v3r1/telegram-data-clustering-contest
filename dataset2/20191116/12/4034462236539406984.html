      <h1>A More Powerful BMW X7 Is Coming</h1>
      <h2>This is our best look yet at Alpina's 600-hp BMW X7.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T12:25:53+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 12:25</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Bigg</a></address>
      <p>The luxurious <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/bmw/x7">BMW X7</a> is the German automaker's current flagship SUV, but reports claim it will be <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/bmw-x8-coming-way-earlier-than-we-thought">superseded by the first-ever X8 as early as next year</a>. While <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/don-t-get-your-hopes-up-for-a-high-performance-bmw-x7-m">BMW refuses to make a hardcore X7 M</a>, an M Performance version of the X8 has reportedly been given the green light.</p>
      <p>If, however, you can't wait for the X8 M, German tuner Alpina is working on an alternative. First spotted lapping the Nurburgring last October, Alpina's X7 M alternative will offer more power and a more aggressive exterior. Since our <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/this-is-the-600-horsepower-x7-m-bmw-refuses-to-build">last sighting of the Alpina XB7 back in August</a>, more camouflage has been stripped away, giving us a clearer look at the potent SUV.</p>

      <p>We can now see the Alpina XB7's new front bumper, which incorporates a deeper spoiler lip and larger air intakes. At the back, Alpina's signature quad exhaust pipes are integrated in a re-designed rear bumper. Also expect the final model to sit on Alpina's signature multi-spoke wheels. Inside, the interior will be even more luxurious, which is no small feat considering that the standard X7 is already BMW's most luxurious SUV on the market.</p>

      <p>The Alpina X7 is expected to come in two flavors, with a gasoline version planned for the US market and a diesel-powered XD7 variant in Europe. While the standard X7 produces 456 hp and 479 lb-ft of torque from a 4.4-liter V8 in the range-topping xDrive50i model, the Alpina XB7 is expected to increase the output to 600 horsepower, while the diesel-powered XD7 will produce around 450 horsepower.</p>
      <p>While America has missed out on many of Alpina's models such as the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/alpina-b3-touring-is-the-bimmer-wagon-we-want-but-cant-have">B3 Touring</a>, the XB7 will go on sale in the US alongside the 7 Series-based <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/bmw/alpina-b7">Alpina B7</a>. The Alpina XB7 is expected to debut within the next few months before first deliveries start in 2020.</p>
