      <h2>Kittiwakes have made the Tyne their home but not everyone's happy. Dr Helen Wilson's looked at whether co-existing with wildlife could become the norm</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T12:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Tony Henderson</a></address>
      <p>The thriving kittiwake colony nesting inland along the Tyne could be a sign of things to come as wildlife reacts to threats such as habitat loss and climate change.</p>
      <p>Many people welcome the Tyne kittiwakes in what is the species’ furthest inland nesting colony in the world.</p>
      <p>More than 100,000 signed a petition last year protesting at birds being trapped, with some fatalities, in deterrent netting on buildings.</p>
      <p>But not everyone is a fan of the kittiwakes, and how cities may have to learn how to co-exist with such arriving wildlife is part of a research project <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/durham-university">by Durham University</a> geographer Dr Helen Wilson.</p>

      <p>Helen, who started her Urban Kittiwakes Project two years ago, says: “I wanted to learn more about the Tyne colony and to better understand the issues. A lot of work has been done on the breeding aspect, but little on its social and cultural aspects.</p>
      <p>“Getting up close to wildlife in a city is something special and the colony has become an important part of Newcastle and Gateshead’s identity.</p>
      <p>“In many ways the colony has become a regional icon and part of the Tyne’s cultural heritage. The birds have been the subject of a children’s book and the focus of multiple art exhibits.”</p>
      <p>A webcam monitoring the kittiwakes nesting on the ledge fronting the<a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/baltic-centre-for-contemporary-art"> Baltic arts centre in Gateshead</a> has also built up an international following, and the birds have become a visitor attraction at the building, which has a viewing platform.</p>

      <p>“Although an important part of the region’s story, kittiwakes are not always easy to live with and can be a challenge,” says Helen. “They can be noisy and messy, which has required a variety of compromises over the years, especially when they have nested on businesses and residential premises.</p>
      <p>“There are a variety of views out there about the kittiwakes, so how can Newcastle and Gateshead address this to allow better co-existence with the birds?”</p>
      <p>Helen has forged links with the north Norwegian city of Tromso, where kittiwakes have begun to nest. She is working with ecologists Tone Reiertsen and Karl Otto Jacobsen and anthropologist Sanne Holmgaard, drawing on the Tyne’s kittiwake colony experiences.</p>
      <p>“Tyneside can play a really important part in forming policies and guidelines on how to live with a kittiwake colony,” Helen says. “Tromso can learn a lot from <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-upon-tyne">Newcastle </a>and Gateshead.”</p>
      <p>What has surprised Helen in her work on the Tyne colony has been the limited knowledge of many people about the birds.</p>
      <p>She says: “There is a lack of understanding about the birds, but when people learn more this changes their perception about the kittiwakes.”</p>
      <p>For example, many have been unaware that the birds are on the UK red list of threatened species. In 2017 they were classed as internationally vulnerable in the wake of a significant and ongoing population decline.</p>

      <p>It has been estimated that the worldwide population has fallen by 40% since 1975, and that in Norway kittiwakes could vanish from the mainland by 2050.</p>
      <p>The decline has been linked to commercial over-fishing of sand eels, a staple of the kittiwake diet. The fish may also have been impacted by climate change, leading to mortality levels and altering distribution.</p>
      <p>More severe weather events may also affect the birds’ ability to feed at sea, while high winds blow nests off coastal ledges.</p>
      <p>“Because kittiwakes are so reliant on fish they act as a barometer for the health of the oceans,” says Helen.</p>
      <p>The Tyne kittiwakes are also regarded under the general heading of “seagulls” by many people, and suffer from sensationalised new stories about gulls which “demonise” the birds, says Helen.</p>
      <p>“But the kittiwakes are not scavengers and spend half of their lives out at sea. Different species behave in different ways.”</p>
      <p>Kittiwakes were first recorded around the Tyne Bridge in 1948 and the first nest on the riverside followed a year later, on a<a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/north-shields"> North Shields building. </a>Last year the Tyne colony totalled 1,357 nests.</p>
      <p>In the early years the birds started nesting on industrial buildings in South Shields and Gateshead, but these were later demolished and now deterrent measures are used on some Quayside buildings.</p>

      <p>“Displacement has become a common theme in the story of the Tyne kittiwakes,” says Helen.</p>
      <p>But with kittiwakes moving into cities like Newcastle and Tromso, she asks: “As climate change and extinctions make headlines, could cities be the future for kittiwakes? If they are, how should cities like Tromso respond? “</p>
      <p>Examples of cities where wildlife has moved in include Austin in Texas, where 1.5million bats roost on its Congress Avenue bridge in the heart of the city.</p>
      <p>At dusk between March and November the bats become one of the city’s most spectacular sights as they emerge to feed.</p>
      <p>In 2010 the bats were made the official animal of Austin and are now a visitor attraction, with the city holding its first Bat Fest.</p>
      <p>”Other cities are learning to live with wildlife that is moving in following the destruction of their habitats, either from climate change or urban development,” Helen says. “Such shifts require new ways of thinking about cities and how we think about the place of wildlife.</p>
      <p>“If kittiwakes return to urban nesting sites every year, might they be considered an urban bird, and what are our obligations to the creatures which share our space with us at a time of environmental change and crisis?“</p>
      <p>Helen has staged a pop-up exhibition on her project at the Old Low Light heritage centre on North Shields Fish Quay, and would like to hear of people’s stories about, and experiences of, the kittiwakes. Contact kittiwakes.research@durham.ac.uk</p>
