        <b>Gunmen have fired on a convoy of buses carrying minority Muslim voters in Sri Lanka on Saturday, hours before polling in presidential elections got under way, reports NDTV.</b>
      </p>
      <p>There were no immediate reports of casualties, but a policeman said the attackers had burnt tyres on the road and set up makeshift road blocks to ambush the convoy of more than 100 vehicles.</p>
      <p>"The gunmen opened fire and also pelted stones," a police official in Tantirimale, 240 kilometres north of Colombo said. "At least two buses were hit, but we have no reports of casualties."</p>
      <p>Muslims from the coastal town of Puttalam were travelling to the neighbouring district of Mannar, where they were registered to vote, the police official added.</p>
      <p>Police reinforcements rushed to the area and cleared the obstructions on the road and escorted the convoy so that passengers could cast their ballots.</p>
      <p>The incident came as police and troops were locked in a tense standoff in the Tamil-dominated northern peninsula of Jaffna where residents complained of military road blocks ahead of voting.</p>
      <p>Sri Lankans have begun voting in a hotly contested presidential election where former military strongman Mahinda Rajapaksa's family is seeking a return to power after five years.</p>
