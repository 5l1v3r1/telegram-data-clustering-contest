      <h1>Chelsea great Gianfranco Zola talks contract offers as he states new job stipulation</h1>
      <h2>Former Chelsea star Gianfranco Zola has been speaking about his managerial future</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T12:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Clarke</a></address>
      <p>Gianfranco Zola has opened up on his future after departing <a href="https://www.football.london/chelsea-fc/">Chelsea</a> at the end of last season.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/gianfranco-zola">Zola</a> starred for Chelsea from 1996 to 2003 before he went into management three years after retiring in 2005.</p>
      <p>The Italian managed West Ham from 2008 to 2010 before he moved back to his homeland and took over a post coaching youth football at a national level.</p>
      <p>Stints at Watford, Cagliari, Al-Arabi and Birmingham City were next up but all ended without major success.</p>
      <p>Zola then re-joined Chelsea last year with Maurizio Sarri but left this summer following the latter's short stint as the club's manager.</p>
      <p>The 53-year-old is currently out of work but searching for the right fit, with the former Chelsea striker adamant he does not want to join a club mid-season ever again.</p>
      <p>Asked on Soccer AM if he was looking for a new role, Zola said: "Yes. Luckily I am not the type of person to go crazy, though. I give myself plenty to do.</p>
      <p>"There have been some opportunities but I want to make sure. The last two times I went on jobs during the season it didn't go well.</p>
