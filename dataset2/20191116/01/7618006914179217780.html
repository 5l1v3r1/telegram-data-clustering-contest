      <p>A question I have often been asked is whether or not it is possible to slow-<br/>cook – braise, perhaps – serious chunks of meat like, say, chunky beef ribs<br/>on a gas barbecue. And the answer? No problem…</p>
      <p>Pick up 2kg of beef ribs – short ribs, perhaps, or a couple of those stonking<br/>great whole ribs, each knocked into three. Any serious butcher will have or will<br/>obtain these for you and, if not, change butchers. Do not expect to find them<br/>in a supermarket which, in my view, is no place from which to source serious<br/>meat, anyway.</p>
      <p>Sprinkle the ribs generously with sea salt and my all-purpose dry rub from any<br/>of my books, or your favourite dry rub, and place them in a large. resealable<br/>plastic bag. Refrigerate overnight, or longer if you like.</p>
      <p>Now, fire up a gas grill or a kamado and prepare some braising liquid in a grill-<br/>friendly baking dish or, my preference, a large Le Creuset pan by combining<br/>two small bottles of wheat beer, 1 1/2 cups of water, 2 tbs raw sugar, two<br/>flattened (but unpeeled) garlic cloves and several sprigs of fresh thyme.</p>
      <p>Lightly oil (with EV olive oil) the ribs and return them to room temperature.<br/>Also, slice three red onions into thick (1.5cm) rounds, then spike each round<br/>with a metal skewer to hold the rings together. Oil and season.</p>
      <p>Clean and lightly oil the grill which should be reading at least 220C, or even a<br/>touch higher. Place the ribs and the onions on it. Cook them, moving them<br/>through 90 degrees after three minutes on the first side, and cook for a total of<br/>six minutes a side – covered, of course.</p>
      <p>Remove the onions and add to the braising liquid at this stage and continue to sear the ribs until they are<br/>comprehensively charred. Depending on the power of your grill, you may<br/>need to reduce the heat slightly while doing this, but keep the temperature<br/>fairly high. Actual cremation, however, as in life, should be avoided.</p>
      <p>Now lift the grill-marked, caramelised ribs off the grill and place in the pan with<br/>the braising liquid and onions. Cover with foil and place on the grill, reducing<br/>all burners to low and turning off the burner under the pan completely once a<br/>temperature of around 160 C has been reached in the barbecue.<br/>Or, alternatively, by placing a heat deflector in position if you are using a<br/>kamado.</p>
      <p>Cook, covered of course, for around 2 hours, or until the ribs are becoming<br/>tender.<br/>Remove the foil and continue to cook the ribs, barbecue lid down of course,<br/>until they are further caramelised and meltingly tender when you test them<br/>with a long, thin fork, and the sauce has reduced and thickened. If more liquid<br/>is required at any stage, simply add water. Do not let the pan boil dry.</p>
      <p>Lift the cooked ribs and onions from the tray with a perforated spoon and<br/>place on a warm serving dish. Tent with foil. Strain the sauce, ideally into a fat<br/>separating jug if you have one, or into a bowl and allow to settle before<br/>skimming off the fat.</p>
      <p>Use the thick liquid remaining as a sauce for the ribs, which are best served<br/>on steamed rice, with mash, or simply with boiled spuds. Be amazed.</p>
