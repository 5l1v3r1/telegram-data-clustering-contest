      <h1>Ski resorts selling mountain water is a risky move, critics say</h1>
      <h2>Alberta allowed ski resort in Kananaskis Country to sell about 50 million litres to third party</h2>

      <p>Alberta’s decision to allow a ski hill in a provincial park to sell water it’s not using and have it trucked away sets a bad precedent that could restrict the province’s ability to react to climate change, environmentalists say.</p>
      <p>“If we’re reallocating more and more water for commercial sale, that really ties up our choices and future generation’s choices,” Carolyn Campbell of the Alberta Wilderness Association said Friday.</p>
      <p>In October, Alberta Environment approved an application from Fortress Mountain ski resort in Spray Valley Provincial Park — part of vast and popular mountain playground called Kananaskis Country — to change its water licence.</p>
      <p>In the past, the resort was allocated just under 100 million litres of water a year from Galatea Creek for its kitchen and other on-site facilities.</p>
      <p>The government agreed to amend that licence Oct. 25 to allow it to sell about half that amount to a third party. The water is to be pumped into trucks and driven away for sale.</p>
      <p>Published reports have suggested it will be bottled and marketed as pure, glacier-fed water.</p>
      <p>Campbell acknowledges 50 million litres is a small amount of water in the context of the Bow Valley watershed, which cities such as Calgary depend on.</p>
      <p>But she’s concerned that allowing Fortress to sell water originally intended for local use could open the door for other companies to do the same.</p>
      <p>“Now, does everybody who isn’t using every drop of their water upstream of Calgary get to sell it?” she asks.</p>
      <p>Issuing water sale permits will make it harder for governments to manage water supply, she said — especially as climate change alters the region’s hydrology.</p>
      <p>The Geological Survey of Canada has already warned that the Rocky Mountain glaciers that keep prairie rivers and streams full during low-snow years are on their way out.</p>
      <p>“Every drop counts for the future given even natural variation without climate change,” Campbell said. “You layer climate change, it’s just a very concerning precedent for our mountain headwaters.</p>
      <p>“Mountain ecosystems use every drop of water. It’s better to leave it in the stream rather that try to commodify it from a protected area.”</p>
      <p>Fortress Mountain did not immediately return an emailed request for an interview.</p>
      <p>Alberta Environment acknowledged it received concerns about Fortress’ application. All were dismissed, said press secretary Jess Sinclair.</p>
      <p>“None of those who filed were found to be directly affected,” she said in an email. “None of the statements of concern filed were found to be valid.”</p>
      <p>The department did not provide an interview.</p>
