      <h1>Kim Kardashian meets with death row inmate as they learn of stay of execution</h1>
      <h2>Kim Kardashian has been lobbying for a stay of execution for Rodney Reed and expressed her delight after she was in the room as the news was broken to him</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T01:25:02+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 01:25</time> by <a rel="author">James Brinsford, https://www.facebook.com/james.brinsford</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kim-kardashian">Kim Kardashian</a> has expressed her delight at the stay of execution for death row inmate Rodney Reed, after she was with him when news came through he had been given a 120-day reprieve.</p>
      <p>The 39-year-old Keeping Up With The Kardashians star is a massive advocate for prison reform and she was able to meet Rodney face-to-face as time was running out before his execution.</p>
      <p>Rodney is on death row in Texas for the murder of Stacey Stites in 1996.</p>
      <p>TMZ has reported that police charged Rodney with raping, assaulting and strangling Stacey to death.</p>
      <p>He has maintained his innocence over the past 20 years and has always claimed that they pair had a consensual affair.</p>

      <p>The US media has reported recently that a former inmate has claimed that Stacey's own fiancé had confessed to him, saying that he had killed her for 'sleeping around'.</p>
      <p>Kim got involved, along with a number of celebrities, to try and stop Rodney's execution and for the crime to be investigated again.</p>
      <p>On October 19, the reality star tweeted: "PLEASE @GovAbbott How can you execute a man when since his trial, substantial evidence that would exonerate Rodney Reed has come forward and even implicates the other person of interest. I URGE YOU TO DO THE RIGHT THING."</p>
      <p>It would seem that she has got her wish and on Friday the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals issued the stay of execution, recommending a 120-day reprieve.</p>
      <p>Expressing her delight at the decision, the mum-of-four described the day in a series of tweets.</p>
      <p>Kim said: "Today, I had the honor of meeting #RdneyReed in person and the privilege of sitting with him when he got the news that the highest court in Texas had issued a stay of execution and remanded the case back to the trial court for further consideration."</p>

      <p>She continued in a second tweet: "Words cannot describe the relief and hope that swept over the room in that moment.</p>
      <p>"That hope had been building over the last few weeks around Rodney’s case. We have seen Democrats and Republicans come together. We have seen grassroots activists and lawmakers link arms."</p>

      <p>Kim then added: "We have heard people all around the globe speak up. And all because of a deep belief that every man or woman accused of a crime - especially one punishable by death - deserves the chance to have all available evidence considered."</p>
      <p>She concluded: "So grateful for the commitment and passion of everyone who voiced their support, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles for their recommendation to issue a 120 day reprieve, and the courts for issuing a stay!"</p>
