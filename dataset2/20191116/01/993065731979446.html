      <p>:: Where do you work?</p>
      <p>I own and work in The Lighthouse Bistro in Whitehead, Co Antrim.</p>
      <p>:: Are you calm in the kitchen?</p>
      <p>Generally yes, but if something interrupts the flow it can test my patience.</p>
      <p>:: When did you start cooking?</p>
      <p>At age 19 in Restaurant Hamlet in Helsinki. My grandmother owned three restaurants across the city at various times, which inspired me.</p>
      <p>:: What fires you up about food?</p>
      <p>Simple but good food. Tomato soup, for instance; everyone can make it but it takes skill to make it excellent. You can't fake it as there's nowhere to hide.</p>
      <p>:: What have you been cooking lately?</p>
      <p>Everything from chicken liver mousse to duck confit! I've been sourcing local lobster from our Islandmagee fisherman and pairing it with my handmade pasta for lunch service.</p>
      <p>:: Signature dish?</p>
      <p>Sprott's Portadown pork belly (which I smoke myself in the Bistro) with butternut squash and house chilli jam. It's a combination of classical French cooking and modern street food.</p>
      <p>:: Favourite thing to eat?</p>
      <p>Street food, especially tacos. It's not just about food, it's the whole experience, so hopefully enjoying some new flavours while on holiday with nothing to do.</p>
      <p>:: What chef inspires you most?</p>
      <p>Marco Pierre White for character and French chef Auguste Escoffier for classical cooking.</p>
