      <p>The Clark County Fire Department on Friday announced who will be its new leader following Chief Greg Cassell’s retirement in February.</p>
      <p>Deputy Fire Chief John Steinbeck will step into the role pending ratification of the appointment by the Clark County Commission on Dec. 3, according to a news release from the Fire Department. Steinbeck started at the department as a firefighter in 1990.</p>
      <p>Cassell’s last day as chief will be Feb. 6, the release said. Cassell, who was hired in June 1989, was appointed chief in <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/local-las-vegas/clark-county-fire-department-veteran-becomes-chief/">February 2015</a>.</p>
      <p>Recruitment for the fire chief position was done within the department, the release said.</p>
      <p>“The men and women that serve on our fire department are incredible and I am truly humbled by this opportunity,” Steinbeck is quoted in the release.</p>
      <p>Steinbeck has served as a battalion chief, training captain, suppression captain and has been a member of the Federal Emergency Management Agency search and rescue team since 1993, the release said. He was appointed deputy fire chief and emergency manager in February 2014.</p>
      <p>Steinbeck is also the chair of the Las Vegas Urban Area Security Initiative Working Group and the co-chair of the Nevada Homeland Security Working Group, according to the county’s website.</p>
      <p>After the Route 91 Harvest Festival mass shooting, Steinbeck was the incident commander for the Family Assistance Center and coordinated the <a href="https://rj.newsengin.com/gps2/">Vegas Strong Resilience Center</a>.</p>
