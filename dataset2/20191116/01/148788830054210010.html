      <h1>Disney Sets New Batch of Release Dates, Including For New Marvel Movies in 2023</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T01:50:05+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 01:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.slashfilm.com/author/ben-pearson/" target="_blank">Ben Pearson</a></address>
      <p>Some people say the holiday season is the most wonderful time of the year. Unfortunately, those people are fools. For if anyone ever makes such a claim to me, I loudly scoff in their faces and quickly set ’em straight: the <i>actual</i> most wonderful time of the year is whenever a major movie studio drops a batch of new release dates without any titles attached to them. And today’s my lucky day, folks, because The Walt Disney Company has just reorganized its upcoming release schedule, and there are Untitled Marvel Movies as far as the eye can see. *sniffs* It’s beautiful.</p>
      <p>Before we get to the Marvel stuff, <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/disney-fox-release-schedule-the-last-duel-the-kings-man-nimona-1202787773/">Deadline</a> points out that Matthew Vaughn’s <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/new-the-kings-man-trailer/"><i><b>The King’s Man</b></i></a> has been bumped from Valentine’s Day 2020 all the way back to <b>September 18, 2020</b>, meaning it will face off against Paramount’s action film <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/without-remorse-cast-jamie-bell/"><i>Without Remorse</i></a>. Meanwhile, Ben Affleck and Ana de Armas’s <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/deep-water-cast-ben-affleck-ana-de-armas/"><b><i>Deep Water</i></b></a> will open on November 13, 2020.</p>
      <p>Also worth noting is that Disney has given a release date to <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/the-last-duel-scott-affleck-damon/"><b><i>The Last Duel</i></b></a>, which stars Matt Damon, Adam Driver, Affleck, and Jodie Comer and was <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/new-matt-damon-and-ben-affleck-movie/">written by Damon and Affleck</a>. There was some question as to whether Disney would make this movie given its subject matter, but now it’s official: Ridley Scott’s period piece will open in limited release on <b>December 25, 2020</b> and then go wide on <b>January 8, 2021</b>.</p>
      <p>You can head over to Deadline to get into all of the nitty gritty details about the rest of the studio’s new release dates and the dates for a bunch of untitled Disney and Fox titles, but I know why you’re all here, so let’s jump ahead a couple of years, shall we?</p>

      <h3>Marvel Movies</h3>
