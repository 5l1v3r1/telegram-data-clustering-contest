      <p>MEXICO CITY &gt;&gt; Tropical Storm Raymond has formed in the eastern Pacific off Mexico and is forecast to head in the direction of the resort-studded Los Cabos area of the Baja California Peninsula.</p>
      <p>The U.S. National Hurricane Center reports that Raymond has maximum sustained winds of 45 mph.</p>
      <p>Its center was about 610 miles south of the peninsulaâ€™s tip as of 5 a.m. Hawaii time, and headed toward the north-northwest at 7 mph.</p>
      <p>Although Raymond is expected to strengthem a little over the next day or so, forecasters expect weakening to occur by Sunday, with the storm degenerating into a remnant low by late Sunday or early Monday.</p>
