      <p>
        <b>The Irish News, November 16 2009: AIB Ulster Club Senior Football Championship semi-final: Loup (Derry)1-12 Kilcoo (Down)1-11</b>
      </p>
      <p>A thunderbolt shot off Paul Young’s left foot, ripped into the back of the Down champions net nine minutes from the end of normal time.</p>
      <p>The goal was what Loup needed.</p>
      <p>Just four minutes earlier an exciting, hard-fought contest appeared, not for the first occasion, to be Kilcoo’s to win as Jim McCorry’s live-wire outfit led by four points.</p>
      <p>Young’s ability to nail Brian Doyle’s raking pass, spin on a sixpence and scamper left away from his marker to unleash a brilliant finish was the spark for a late revival from Derry’s Ulster title contenders.</p>
      <p>It left his manager John Brennan thrilled to bits and relishing now the prospect of a final shoot-out against Antrim champions St Gall’s the weekend after next.</p>
      <p>With two well-crafted points from play,Young matched wing half-forward and chief free-taker Paul McVey as their leading marksman.</p>
      <p>The fine contribution Donal Kane made to Kilcoo’s cause, scoring 1-4, edged that category overall, but that was no consolation to the devastated beaten semi-finalists.</p>
