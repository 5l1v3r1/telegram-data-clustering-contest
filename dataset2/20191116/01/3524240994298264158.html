      <h1>Joshua must overcome real adversity, says Fury</h1>

      <p>Anthony Joshua is entering ‘real men’s territory’ after witnessing the harsh reality of heavyweight boxing ahead of his rematch with Andy Ruiz Jr, says trainer Peter Fury.</p>
      <p>The British star battles Ruiz Jr again in Saudi Arabia on December 7, live on Sky Sports Box Office, just over six months since his world titles and unbeaten record were taken by the Mexican in a stunning stoppage loss at New York’s Madison Square Garden in June.</p>
      <p>Fury is fully aware of the bittersweet experiences as a heavyweight boxer, having worked the corner of nephew Tyson Fury, and his own son Hughie, and believes Joshua must overcome genuine adversity for the first time.</p>
      <p>“Look at the admiration he had when he was winning everything and then look what people do as soon as you have a hiccup,” Fury told Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>“You see who your friends are, you see a lot of stuff. Boxing can be very fickle. There’s a lot of imposters in it, there’s a lot of cheerleaders in it.</p>
      <p>“He’ll know where he stands. This is real men’s territory now. This is where real men sit up and realise ‘right, my back is against the wall, all these hangers on are gone, it’s me and him.’</p>
      <p>“I think he’ll do well. I think he’ll show that. He’s dedicated, he’s a proper athlete, and I think he’ll come through it.”</p>
      <p>The respected trainer is preparing Hughie to return against Pavel Sour in Monte Carlo on November 30, live on Sky Sports, and has revamped the 25-year-old’s boxing style after a points loss to Alexander Povetkin in August.</p>
