      <p>Wow.</p>
      <p>The lengths some desperate celebrities will go to for attention on social media is just astounding.</p>
      <p>Really, it's the ones who post photos of themselves hooked up to non-essential vitamin drips, prompting fans to raise concern for their health, that annoy me the most.</p>
      <p>However, when there is a positive message behind it, that's a different story.</p>
      <p>This week, in a bid to reach 50 million followers on Instragram, Men In Black mega star Will Smith pushed social media boundaries when he live-streamed his own colonoscopy.</p>
      <p>Now, I know it's not something many of us like to talk about (intimate health issues) however, I can't believe that in this day and age, some people are still too embarrassed to get these type of procedures carried out - despite the fact they can be life-saving.</p>
      <p>Well, not Will Smith.</p>
      <p>He's all about his health these days and wants everyone else to be too.</p>
      <p>The 51-year-old Independence Day actor filmed a visit to his doctor's office to undergo a colonoscopy. I could be unkind and suggest it was in the hope of picking up an extra 10 million followers but I'm sure that's not the only reason.</p>
      <p>In the narrated clip, the father-of-three talked fans through each step of getting ready for the procedure and also the importance of looking after our health.</p>
      <p>He told fans that his doctor had recommended the procedure as he is now in his fifties.</p>
      <p>The star added: "They said you can't get to 50 million followers on IG without showing your butt. So here I am, gettin' a colonoscopy for the clout".</p>
      <p>The Philadelphia-born actor then went on to talk about the importance of regular doctor visits.</p>
      <p>"It's 2019, gotta get our health right. There's a certain amount of commitment and embarrassment involved with being healthy. You just gotta do it, man".</p>
      <p>Later, when he awoke, doctors said the procedure had gone well.</p>
      <p>"I'm totally back, everything feels normal," he said.</p>
      <p>His doctor also revealed that a polyp had been removed revealing pre-cancerous tissue - and that a potential health disaster was likely averted with the detection.</p>
      <p>While I know some people will not be overjoyed by the nature of his video, what Mr Smith has done here is to be applauded.</p>
      <p>Finally, someone with a bit of influence has used social media for good.</p>
      <p>I'm not sure if he got his additional 10 million followers but his experience and the outcome is likely have been viewed by millions of fans who now may be prompted to make their own appointments to get checked.</p>
      <p>Job well done Will.</p>
      <p>Now put your clothes back on, we've seen just about enough.</p>
      <p>-----------------------------------------------------</p>
      <p>Legendary actress Jane Fonda has vowed to give up shopping for clothes.</p>
      <p>Known for her flawless red carpet style, the 81-year-old Book Club star made the announcement during her weekly climate change protest in Washington.</p>
      <p>The New York-born mother-of-three said the iconic red coat she has worn to every protest so far is the last piece of clothing she will ever buy in a bid to fight consumerism.</p>
      <p>Already arrested and having spent a night in jail, the double Oscar winner said she plans to get arrested every Friday at the protest.</p>
      <p>Whatever floats your boat Jane. We will watch this space.</p>
