      <h3>The Star Wars Holiday Special</h3>
      <p>In conversation with <a href="https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/jon-favreau-star-wars-life-day-1203405427/">Variety</a>, Jon Favreau reiterated he’s <i>legitimately interested</i> in directing a second <i>Star Wars Holiday Special</i> for Disney+.</p>
      <blockquote>Oh I would definitely be interested in doing a holiday special. And I’m not going to say who I would be interested in. But one of the people is the member of the cast in an upcoming episode of the show. So we’ll leave it at that for now. I’ve been thinking about it. It’s ready, the ideas are ready. I think it could be really fun. Not as part of this, but there’s an excitement around it because it was so fun and weird, and off and not connected to what Star Wars was in the theatre. The Mandalorian cartoon, the Boba Fett cartoon, from the holiday special was definitely a point of inspiration for what we did in the show.</blockquote>
