      <p>After brutally knocking former champion Luke Rockhold in the former champion’s debut in the light heavyweight division, Jan Blachowicz has once again been given the task of welcoming a former middleweight to 205. This time around, the 36-year-old is set to take on Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu ace Ronaldo ‘Jacare’ Souza. The former Strikeforce champ is, like Rockhold, moving up in weight for the first time in his career.</p>

      <p>Scheduled to take on Jacare in hostile territory, at UFC Sao Paulo, Blachowicz told <a href="https://sportv.globo.com/site/combate/noticia/blachowicz-promete-nocautear-ronaldo-jacare-no-ufc-sp-e-espera-comemorar-com-cerveja-brasileira.ghtml">Combate</a> that he intends to make the fight a quick one. He’s predicting another knockout win, and hoping not to find himself on the ground against one of the best jiu-jitsu practitioners in the UFC.</p>
      <blockquote>“I’ll knock him out in the second or third round, with a right a hook. I think it’s going to be a tough fight, really good to watch. I know the arena will be loud, and people will be cheering for Jacare, but I have to beat him and that’s what I’ll do.”<br/><br/>“I need to be very focused.” Jan continued. “Everyone knows his jiu-jitsu is the best, but he can punch, too, he can knock you out. I have to pay attention to his striking, but I think he’ll try to take me down and finish me on the ground. Jacare is a legend, a great fighter, it’ll be a pleasure for me. I respect him a lot, but in the Octagon, I must beat him.”</blockquote>
      <p>In order to acclimate to Brazil’s weather, Blachowicz arrived in the country three weeks ago—a decision that even allowed him some time to go sightseeing at Rio de Janeiro’s hills and beaches. However, there is one treat Jan will save for after the fight, Brazilian beer.</p>
      <blockquote>“I came to Brazil over three weeks ago, to acclimate. I went to TFT, in Rio, I sparred and trained there. I had a lot of fun. There’s a beach, I could see the ocean from my apartment. The city is really cool. We went up to Christ the Redeemer; and I love mountains, so we went to Pedra da Gavea. It was really cool. I walked through the jungle, climbed ropes and reached the top. That’s really good for cardio. I tasted acai, too. When I’m at a new place, I always try the food, which is delicious. I’ve been to a barbecue place. What I still need to try is Brazilian beer, but that’s only for after the fight.”</blockquote>
      <p>Blachowicz vs. Jacare is scheduled for the UFC on ESPN+ 22 main event in Sao Paulo. The card is expected to feature a co-main event between Mauricio ‘Shogun’ Rua and Paul Craig. Stay tuned to Bloody Elbow for all live coverage of the event.</p>
