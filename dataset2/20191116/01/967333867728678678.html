        <b>WASHINGTON (Sputnik) - The US has added five sub-entities owned by the Cuban military to its list of entities with which direct financial transactions are forbidden, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement on Friday, as Cuba commemorates Havana's 500th anniversary. It was specified later that the ''sub-entities'' refer to five hotels.</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>"Today, I am announcing an update to the Cuba Restricted List to add five sub-entities owned by the Cuban military to the list of entities with which direct financial transactions are generally prohibited", the statement said on Friday.</blockquote>
      <p>The State Department explained the United States generally prohibits direct financial transactions with entities and sub-entities because they would "disproportionately benefit the Cuban military, intelligence, and security services or personnel at the expense of the Cuban people or private enterprise in Cuba".</p>
      <p>Earlier in October, the Trump administration <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201910261077153141-trump-administration-to-block-all-flights-from-us-to-cuba-except-havana/">suspended commercial flights from the US to Cuba</a>, except for Havana.</p>

      <p>Since 2016, the United States has adopted a rough policy on Havana, restricting travel, boosting the economic embargo and imposing sanctions on Raul Castro, Cuba's Communist Party leader, over ''the ongoing repression of theÂ Cuban people and its support for the corrupt former Maduro regime in Venezuela''.</p>
