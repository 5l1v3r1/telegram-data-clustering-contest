      <p>The Presidency onFriday hailed  the elucidation of the Supreme Court ruling on the appeal filed by the Peoples Democratic Party’s presidential candidate in the February election, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar on the outcome of the polls.</p>
      <p>President Muhammadu Buhari’s  Senior Special Assistant on Media and publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, said in a statement moments after the court’s pronouncement  that the onus of proof must necessarily fall on those that challenged the vote.</p>
      <p>“As the Supreme Court has stated, the case failed this test ,” Shehu said.</p>
      <p>On the issue of qualification, he said, President Buhari has a long history of service to the Federal Republic of Nigeria.</p>
      <p>He said:”The questioning of this fact seems to fly in the face of all evidence.</p>
      <p>“However, now it is time for the PDP to take up the service mandated by this election.</p>
      <p>“The legislative agenda of the Ninth assembly is ambitious in both size and scope. It is critical the opposition is there to scrutinise bills and policies, rather than preoccupy themselves with unsustainable court cases.</p>

      <p>“We appreciate the PDP and their candidate for taking these claims to courts rather than expressing them in other ways, but now Nigeria needs a robust and rigorous opposition. The nation needs to move on.</p>
      <p>“While it is correct to give credit to the courts for affirming this electoral victory-and we commend the courage of the bench to arrive at the right conclusion given manifest and subtle pressures to do otherwise-the reality is that courts were convinced by arguments from the lawyers representing the APC and its candidate, President Muhammadu Buhari that results reflected the true wishes of a majority of our citizens.”</p>
      <p>He recalled that President Buhari won four million more votes than his closest rival, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar in the February poll.</p>
      <p>According to him, no serious electoral observers have challenged the result.</p>
      <p>“And now the Supreme Court has explained why the PDP appeal is unsubstantiated. We hope this finally puts the matter behind us.</p>
      <p>“We should now grasp this moment to move forward – together.”</p>
