      <p>With tweets on <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1195363882489065474">transcripts</a>, the <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1195464209594830854">stock market</a> and San Francisco’s <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201811061069554070-san-francisco-prop-c-midterms/">homelessness</a> and drug crisis, the <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1172853679642333185">“very stable genius”</a> himself had quite the day on social media outside of the so-called “Witch Hunt” on Capitol Hill.</p>
      <p>While <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1195337873882583042">this particular tweet</a> from the US president <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911041077217906-trump-pelosi-lost-her-mind-impeachment/">toward Pelosi</a> is unlikely to result in any repercussions, Trump may want to ease up on his Twitter tirades, because House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff (D-CA) <a href="https://twitter.com/politico/status/1195456991088521217">made it clear</a> to reporters on Friday following the hearing that he viewed 45’s posts referencing Yovanovitch as “part of a pattern to intimidate witnesses.”</p>

      <p>Then again, Trump could always attribute his tweets to <a href="https://twitter.com/ZekeJMiller/status/1195420327473483776">whomever was allegedly retweeting Republican lawmakers</a> from his account while he was giving an address.</p>
