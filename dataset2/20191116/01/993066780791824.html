      <p>“Two Tyrone defenders read it perfectly and if any player besides Michael had been in their vicinity it would have been safely clear. But he shoulders the ball loose and then manages to hit Brick Molloy on the turn. Brick is straight through on goal and he strikes low. He goes for broke and wheels away in delight. I feel relief more than elation.”</p>
      <p>Jim McGuinness, ‘Until Victory Always'</p>
      <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * * *</p>
      <p>BY the time he was 23, Dermot ‘Brick' Molloy had made 50 appearances for Donegal. In his back pocket were a Celtic Cross, three Ulster medals and a Division Two National League title.</p>
      <p>He'd been one of the key hands on the U21 team that reached the 2010 All-Ireland final, and they'd no sooner been beaten by Dublin than John Joe Doherty had pulled him into the senior setup.</p>
      <p>In that summer's club championship he shot the lights out, hitting a stunning goal in the final win over Killybegs as the Glenties reached their first Ulster club final, only to fall by the mighty sword of Crossmaglen.</p>
      <p>Molloy played all his senior football for the county under Jim McGuinness, and the curtain came down on them both in the aftermath of the 2014 All-Ireland final defeat.</p>
      <p>Brought on with six minutes to go, he was on the pitch just 20 seconds when he curled over a superb effort from the wrong side that pulled Donegal back within three.</p>
      <p>His only other touch of the ball was in stoppage time as cut in off the same wing, helping fashion the late goal chance that Colm McFadden pushed on to the base of the post.</p>
      <p>It was his last act in a Donegal jersey.</p>
      <p>Yet if you ask anyone to dig into the memory bank and pull out the first thing that comes to mind when they hear the name Brick Molloy, the answer never changes.</p>
      <p>It's always that goal against Tyrone. The 2011 Ulster semi-final and Donegal have spent the entire year aching for this game.</p>
      <p>Stoppage time, the sides tied and Michael Murphy strips Ciaran Gourley of the ball. Pops it in for Molloy, who doesn't have a second ill thought about popping it over the bar.</p>
      <p>It squeezes just under the body of Pascal McConnell, who plants his face on the turf knowing that he'd read the intentions right, but just couldn't keep it out.</p>
      <p>“Me and Pascal were at an Up For The Match in Killygordon last year and we had a good discussion about it. He seemed pretty sure about where I was going, into that corner.</p>
      <p>“There's plenty of times where people said you should have fisted it over the bar, but I've always been a player that if you're in those positions and there's a goal on, you go for it.</p>
      <p>“Tyrone had a chance after that, and a point might have levelled it and Donegal mightn't have been talking about Ulster championships or All-Irelands after that. It was in the moment.</p>
      <p>“There's plenty of nights when you went to bed and thought if you did miss it, you'd be the worst in the world. But it's history. It went in.</p>
      <p>“You still, even now, go on a night out and there's the odd one would come up and say ‘I mind that goal'. It's a nice feeling.</p>
      <p>“Make no mistake about it, for that Donegal squad when we left Clones that evening, we knew we had the Ulster title won. That was the game of all games – we had to get over Tyrone.</p>
      <p>“We talked about it from February, and it was just Tyrone crazy in our heads. Every night Tyrone were mentioned.</p>
      <p>“It was an amazing day for me, I was only a young fella, looking at boys you watched on TV for years – Brian Dooher, Owen Mulligan, Sean Cavanagh, all these boys.</p>
      <p>“Next thing you're pinning a goal that knocks them out of the championship when they're going for three Ulster titles in a row. It's just a very special moment, one that will live long in my lifetime.”</p>
      <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * * *</p>
      <p>WHILE he was very much in the tight circle of 20 men that McGuinness trusted to use in championship football, Molloy only ever started one game in the summer, their first of the whole journey against Antrim in 2011.</p>
      <p>He'd play full league campaigns but inevitably find himself squeezed into the dugout by the time the summer rolled around. It was a role he played diligently for four years, but when McGuinness left, Molloy felt it was time to go too.</p>
      <p>He initially answered Rory Gallagher's call to go back in but opted out in January 2015.</p>
      <p>“I suppose it got to the stage when Rory came in that I didn't feel there would be starts there that I would have wanted to get a good chance at it.</p>
      <p>“I just felt it was time to go. I didn't think it was worth it to hang on and be on the bench.</p>
      <p>“I was very aware at that stage that Naomh Conaill were desperate for a championship. That was probably the main thing, I was going to give one year out of my life to try and get Naomh Conaill over the line.”</p>
      <p>It was only meant to be a temporary hiatus, but that isn't how it's worked out.</p>
      <p>Glenties won back the Donegal title in 2015 and Brick won the club's player of the year award. And his form in helping them led him to think that he would go back.</p>
      <p>But as they chased the Ulster club title that they'd just missed out on in losing the 2010 final, injury struck for Molloy when he suffered a torn posterior ligament in his knee in the Ulster Club defeat by Trillick.</p>
      <p>“At the start of the game a high ball came in. I went up to grab it and as I came down, the knee jarred on me. Ray Moran did the operation in Santry and he was pretty sure it was the sprint afterward that did the damage.</p>
      <p>“I remember Mattie Donnelly going up the stand, there was no-one on him and I made a serious sprint to get back. That was when the damage was really done. I basically pulled the whole lot off the bone.”</p>
      <p>Anthony Thompson was sent off just as Molloy was forced off, and despite a huge second half effort to turn around a six-point lead, the Glenties went down by two.</p>
      <p>That was the start of a torturous spell of injuries. Molloy lost nine months to that knee injury. He was dogged by shoulder trouble for a while, and then just when he felt he was going well again, he ended up playing last year's championship on one leg.</p>
      <p>His uncle Hughie and father John, with whom he works in the construction business, were in charge of the Glenties in 2005 when Jim McGuiness broke his leg and famously stepped into coaching.</p>
      <p>A lot of the remnants of the gameplan he built 14 years ago remain to this day, although in Michael Regan, Michael McLaughlin and Shay Murrin they have a very shrewd managerial trio that Molloy speaks very highly of.</p>
      <p>A second Ulster club final, nine years on from the first, is in the eyeline. After getting through Donegal, they partied from the Wednesday night straight through to the Friday morning. They had a very small window to get ready for Castlerahan but had the nous to crawl over the line.</p>
      <p>Almost a decade on, so many of the same team are 60 minutes from a return to the provincial final.</p>
      <p>“There's a lot of us that are there since the 2010 Ulster final against Crossmaglen. We went in at half-time a point up and ultimately a lack of experience probably, we just didn't get over the line.</p>
      <p>“It's always in your head, ‘will we ever get back to an Ulster final?' It's so difficult to win a county title in Donegal, it's probably the last thing in your head until you do win it.</p>
      <p>“It's a massive ask to try and beat Clontibret now. Hopefully if we can play to the performance levels we've set for ourselves over the last year, we'll not be far off.</p>
      <p>“It's definitely something you dream of when you're playing with Naomh Conaill, trying to get back to an Ulster final. But I can assure you that we're not thinking of Ulster finals at the minute. It's Clontibret on Saturday, that's where our heads are at.”</p>
