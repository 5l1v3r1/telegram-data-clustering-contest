      <p>A police officer accused of being the gunman in the killing of Dumaguete City radio broadcaster and block timer Mercedario “Dindo” Generoso surrendered to authorities, an official said Friday.</p>
      <p>Patrolman Roger Rubio, one of the four alleged suspects in Generoso’s murder, was presented to reporters in Malacañang.</p>

      </p>
      <p>But Brig. Gen. Valeriano de Leon, chief of the Police Regional Office in Central Visayas, said the alleged involvement of policemen in Generoso’s murder was “an isolated case.”</p>
      <p>He said he had asked the Presidential Task Force on Media Security to treat Rubio with “utmost dignity” while the case was ongoing.</p>
      <p>Rubio, a 55, allegedly gunned down Generoso, 67, on Nov. 7 while Generoso was on his way to his radio program “Bai Radio” in Piapi village.</p>
      <p>“This case is actually very isolated, De Leon told reporters.</p>
      <p>Presidential Task Force on Media Security co-chairman and Undersecretary Joel Egco said Rubio, an active patrolman of the Negros Oriental Provincial Mobile Force Company, was the subject of a manhunt.</p>
      <p>Egco said Rubio turned himself in before Lt. Col. Judi Mar Bonilla, the commanding officer of the Negros Oriental Provincial Mobile Force Company, around 6 p.m. on Nov. 13.</p>
      <p>“This morning, we’re pleased to announce that Rubio is now in government custody,” Egco told reporters.</p>
      <p>Generoso was killed while driving his Hyundai Elentra and passing Piapi village in Dumaguete City.</p>
      <p>Rubio was said to have been aboard a Mitsubishi pick-up truck driven by a certain Teddy Salaw, and then transferred to a waiting motorcycle driven by former police Corporal Glenn Corsame to gun down Generoso.</p>
      <p>Tomasino Aledro, the alleged owner of the pick-up truck, has been included in the Bureau of Immigration’s look-out list.</p>
      <p>Corsame and Salaw were arrested on the same day Generoso was killed, while Aledro is still on the loose.</p>
      <p>On Nov. 8, murder charges were filed against Rubio, Corsame, Salaw, and Aledro.</p>
      <p>Lt. Col. Wilfredo Alarcon, officer-in-charge of the Dumaguete City Police Station, said Rubio was identified as the gunman based on the exchange of text messages from Salaw’s cellphone. </p>
      <p>“When we inspected the cellphone, we found the conversation between Teddy Salaw and a contact person named Roger Rubio from the PNP,” said Alarcon, who joined Egco at the press conference.</p>
      <p>He added there was no conversation as to who was the target.</p>
      <p>“There’s no immediate conversation regarding the killing, but it was based on the text messages that said, ‘I’m on my way. Let’s meet in this area. We’re here,’” he added.</p>
      <p>Generoso was an anchor for the development programs of the local government, including a controversial reclamation project that was recently stopped by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources.</p>
      <p>Egco said the motive for Generoso’s killing could be either “work-related or politics or both.” <b>With MJ Blancaflor</b></p>
