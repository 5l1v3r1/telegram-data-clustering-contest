      <p>Disney has announced five new Marvel movie release dates that include one in 2022 and four in 2023. There are no titles for any of the release dates but there will now be four Marvel films released in 2022 and four of them in 2023!</p>
      <p>There were already three release dates set for 2022 for February 18th, May 6th, and July 29th. May 6th is reserved for <i>Black Panther</i>. The new one added is dated for October 7th. Then there are the dates for 2023 which include February 17th, May 5th, July 28th, and November 3rd.</p>
      <p>As you can see Marvel Studios shows no signs of slowing down! They are ramping things up in a big way and Iâ€™m excited to see what these films end up being.</p>
      <p>The upcoming Marvel Studios films that have been announced include <i>Black Widow</i> on May 1, 2020, <i>The Eternals</i> on November 6, 2020, <i>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings</i> on February 12, 2021, <i>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</i> on May 7, 2021, Spider-Man 3 on July 16, 2021, <i>Thor: Love and Thunder</i> on November 5, 2021, and <i>Black Panther 2</i> on May 6, 2022.</p>
      <p>Marvel Studios has yet to confirm release dates for <i>Ant-Man 3,</i><i>Blade, Fantastic Four, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, Captain Marvel 2 </i>and<i> Deadpool 3</i>. What other Marvel project do you think will be announced to fill those other release dates?</p>
