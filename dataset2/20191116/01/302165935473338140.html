      <p>INDIANAPOLIS, Nov 16 — The Indiana Supreme Court has suspended three county circuit court judges without pay for getting into an early-morning fist fight outside a fast-food restaurant that ended with two of them getting shot.</p>
      <p>The altercation involving Clark County Circuit Judges Andrew Adams and Bradley Jacobs and Crawford County Circuit Judge Sabrina Bell was “not merely embarrassing on a personal level,” the Supreme Court said in a document released earlier this week, “they discredited the entire Indiana judiciary.”</p>
      <p>The fight took place in May, when the judges were attending a judicial conference in Indianapolis. Around 3am, as the jurists were walking to a White Castle restaurant after having drinks, the occupants of a passing car appeared to shout something out the window, the document said.</p>
      <p>Judge Bell responded by extending her middle finger. The car pulled over, and two of the occupants, Alfredo Vazquez and Brandon Kaiser, had a verbal altercation with the judges.</p>
      <p>“I drink and get mouthy, and I'm fiery and I'm feisty,” Judge Bell later told police in a recorded statement, according to the court document.</p>
      <p>The shouting match soon turned physical, the document said. Judge Jacobs held Kaiser on the ground, and Judge Adams kicked him in the back. Kaiser then pulled out a gun and shot Adams once in the abdomen and Jacobs twice in the chest.</p>
      <p>Both were transported to local hospitals. Adams had two emergency surgeries, including a colon resectioning, and Jacobs had two emergency surgeries and was hospitalised for 14 days.</p>
      <p>In September, Adams pleaded guilty to battery resulting in bodily injury and was ordered to serve two days in jail with the remainder of his 365-day sentence suspended.</p>
      <p>Adams was suspended from his job on the bench without pay for 60 days.</p>
      <p>A grand jury declined to bring criminal charges against Judge Jacobs.</p>
      <p>Jacobs and Judge Bell were suspended from their jobs without pay for 30 days.</p>
      <p>Reuters was not immediately able to reach representatives of Judge Bell or Adams for comment.</p>
      <p>An attorney for Jacobs, Larry Wilder, said the judge accepted his punishment and was happy to be returning to work.</p>
      <p>Jacobs “acknowledged that his behavior that evening, although not illegal, was unbecoming of a judge and that his actions were injudicious and reflected poorly upon him and his peers on the bench,” Wilder said in an email. — Reuters</p>
