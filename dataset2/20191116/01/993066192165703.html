      <p>Danske Bank Premiership: Cliftonville v Ballymena United (today, Solitude, 3pm)</p>
      <p>BALLYMENA United's 2-1 victory over Cliftonville at the end of September was a turning point in the season for both teams – but not in a way you would expect from such a result as the sides prepare to meet again at Solitude this afternoon.</p>
      <p>A second-half fightback from David Jeffrey's side meant that they remained unbeaten after eight games of the Premiership season. Meanwhile, that defeat was the Reds' third in their first nine games.</p>
      <p>Since then both have embarked on six-game league runs – Cliftonville winning all of theirs and Ballymena unable to earn a victory in that stretch.</p>
      <p>Even though the visitors arrive having picked up just two points from their last possible 18, Cliftonville boss Paddy McLaughlin said that they would do everything in their power to ensure that their winning streak is not book-ended by another loss to United.</p>
      <p>“Ballymena challenged for the title last year, they ran Linfield close,” McLaughlin said.</p>
      <p>“We'll certainly not be taking them for granted. We're expecting a tough game and any team managed by David Jeffrey is always going to be highly motivated.</p>
      <p>“They may be on a bad run at the minute but we're expecting a real battle.”</p>
      <p>Eighteen points from the last 18 has catapulted Clintonville right into the mix at the top of the table. McLaughlin admits that their ability to fly under the radar is waning, but he still feels that they can take care of business away from the spotlight.</p>
      <p>“I think the league is going to stay this way all the way through with five or six teams pushing,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It's brilliant for the league, brilliant for the supporters and it's exciting for the neutrals too.</p>
      <p>“We just happen to be where we are at and we know it's going to be very difficult to stay in touch with the leaders because they are good sides with big squads.</p>
      <p>“We just have to keep improving. That's what we're trying to do in order to stay in touch with the leaders for as long as we can.</p>
      <p>“We're quite happy to be floating below the radar for now. As long as the boys keep performing as they have been and keep their heads down, you never know where it could take you.</p>
      <p>“The performances from the boys have been excellent. The goals have been excellent and they have been keeping so many clean sheets. That's the reward they get for their hard work and maybe they'll get that wee bit of respect that maybe hasn't always been there for them.”</p>
      <p>Worryingly for Cliftonville supporters, McLaughlin said that a bout of flu has hampered their preparations for tomorrow's game.</p>
      <p>The Reds boss said that a decision would be made this morning on “two to three players” but he is still confident that they will not be disrupted too much.</p>
      <p>“There is a bit of flu going around the camp and a few people are having trouble with it,” he said. “It's the time of year for it but hopefully they will get the OK from the doctor.”</p>

      <p>Institute v Linfield</p>
      <p>(today, the Brandywell, 1pm)</p>
      <p>INSTITUTE will be bracing themselves for a Linfield backlash after the Blues suffered a humiliating 6-0 Champions Cup loss to Dundalk on Monday night. David Healy will demand a big performance to get it out of their system but they will be without Shayne Lavery who is on international duty. Institute have drawn their last three games, all of those against top six opposition, so they do carry some confidence into this fixture.</p>
      <p>H: 7/1 D: 15/4 A: 3/10</p>
      <p>Verdict: Linfield</p>
      <p>Cliftonville v Ballymena United</p>
      <p>(today, Solitude, 3pm)</p>
      <p>CLIFTONVILLE have won six league games in a row, scoring 16 and conceding just one goal during that run. Some players have showed symptoms of the flu this week but Paddy McLaughlin is still hopeful of having close to a full team to select from. Ballymena haven't won in their last six league games and Solitude is not the easiest of places to go right now to get back on track.</p>
      <p>H: 1/5 D: 5/1 A: 17/2</p>
      <p>Verdict: Cliftonville</p>
      <p>Dungannon Swifts v Larne</p>
      <p>(today, Stangmore Park, 3pm)</p>
      <p>DUNGANNON are just starting to look over their shoulders following five straight league losses. Some positivity would be most welcome here, especially with Glentoran and Crusaders still to come this month. The sides drew 0-0 at Inver Park earlier in the season but Larne will be targeting all three points today.</p>
      <p>H: 14/5 D: 13/5 A: 3/4</p>
      <p>Verdict: Larne</p>
      <p>Warrenpoint Town v Coleraine</p>
      <p>(today, Milltown, 3pm)</p>
      <p>IT'S top versus bottom and there's little chance of this game not following the form book. Barry Gray's return to Warrenpoint hasn't led to the new manager bounce and they have lost three from three. Gray has said that they will be looking bodies and, crucially, experience in the January transfer window. Coleraine's win over Glenavon last week was their eighth straight victory in all competitions. They should remain on top by the close of play tomorrow.</p>
      <p>H: 9/1 D: 5/1 A: 1/5</p>
      <p>Verdict: Coleraine</p>
