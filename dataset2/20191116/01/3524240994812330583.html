      <p>Nigerians have slammed the national U-23 side’s inability to qualify for the 2020 summer Olympics in Tokyo after failing to beat South Africa in their last Group B game.</p>
      <p>The U-23 side recorded one win, a draw and a loss at the ongoing U-23 AFCON in Egypt which also doubles as the Olympics qualifier.</p>
      <p>Nigeria lost their first match of the competition 1-0 to Ivory Coast before defeating Zambia 3-1 in their second group game needing a win against South Africa to secure passage to the semi-finals.</p>
      <p>Ivory Coast topped the group with six points after defeating Zambia by a lone goal in the other group game with South Africa finishing second with five points, Nigeria is third with four points while Zambia finished the group with a point.</p>
      <p>Reacting to the team’s failure to reach the semi-finals, Abenasports on Twitter said it is a shame how local coaches have failed to prove themselves with the job assigned to them.</p>
      <p>“Flying Eagles failed, Golden Eaglets fumbled and now Dream Team VII. Shame!! Local coaches can’t prove themselves.”</p>
      <p>Kenoke Atuegwu has called for the sack of the team’s coach, Imama Amapakabo.</p>
      <p>“How can a coach perform woefully at three different tournaments? This is not coincidence; the man is bang below average and should be sacked immediately they come back from Egypt! This is too much to bear, and having in mind the Olympics is every four years, so it is till 2024.”</p>
      <p>“Imama has set the worst record in the history of Nigerian football. He successfully crashed Nigeria out of three tournaments within a space of four weeks; WAFU, CHAN and U-23 AFCON,” commented Temitayo Ojotayo.</p>
      <p>Afolabi Obe also called for the coach’s sack, “This is sad, Nigerians have just lost 70 percent interest in the next Olympics, probably one of the slim chances we had for a medal. Imama should not go near any national football team again.”</p>
      <p>With the loss, Nigeria will not be represented in the football event of the Olympics after the Super Falcons also failed to book a spot.</p>
