      <h2>Nathaniel Berhow is believed to have opened fire at Saugus High School in Santa Clarita, California, using a handgun hidden in his backpack - before turning the weapon om himself</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T01:07:58+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 01:07</time> by <a rel="author">Joshua Taylor, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>A 16-year-old boy suspected of killing two classmates in a school shooting has died in hospital.</p>
      <p>Nathaniel Berhow is said to have shot himself in the head after killing the students, aged 16 and 14, at Saugus High School in Santa Clarita, California.</p>
      <p>The suspect died this afternoon with his mother next to him after his life support machine was switched off, according to police.</p>
      <p>The shooter pulled a handgun from his backpack and emptied it in a matter of seconds as the school day began.</p>
      <p>The gun rampage on Thursday - Berhow's 16th birthday - left two students dead and three more injured.</p>
      <p>Captain Kent Wegener, of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, said the entire incident, captured on videotape, lasted just 16 seconds as the young man stood in one spot and fired at one student after another.</p>
      <p>"From right where he was standing, he doesn't chase anybody, he fires from where he is until he shoots himself," Wegener said.</p>

      <p>The scene awas reminiscent of other mass shootings at US schools, including Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, where a former student with an assault gun killed 17 people in February 2018.</p>
      <p>It was the 85th incident of gunfire at a school this year, according to Everytown, a gun control advocacy group. </p>
      <p>Authorities have no clues about what sparked this latest bloodshed.</p>
      <p>"We did not find any manifesto, any diary that spelled it out," Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said at a briefing.</p>

      <p>Two girls, aged 14 and 15, remain in hospital in stable conditions. A boy, 14, who was also injured, has been released.</p>
      <p>The FBI is assisting in the investigation and police do not know yet where the suspect got the weapon.</p>
      <p>Katie Holt, a fine arts teacher, pushed the piano in the music room against the classroom door to create a barricade.</p>
      <p>"She turned off the lights... She locked all the doors. She pushed the piano to the door, totally barricading," said Eddie Mendoza, 17 in a phone interview, his voice still breaking from emotion and grief.</p>
      <p>One student was heard saying "I think I got shot" as a group locked themselves inside a choir classroom.</p>
