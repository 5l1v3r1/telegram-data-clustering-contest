      <p>Penticton drug users are being urged to exercise caution in the wake of a recent increase in suspected drug overdoses in the area.</p>
      <p>Interior Health is reporting a rise in the number of opioid overdoses in the Penticton community after people have used what was believed to be a stimulant or upper, such as amphetamines or methamphetamines.</p>
      <p>Anyone using illegal drugs is advised to take steps to reduce the risk:</p>
      <p>For safety sake:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>   Get your drugs checked for the presence of fentanyl available at the SOWINS (South Okanagan Women in Need Society) mobile outreach van. Call or text (250) 809-7054. For more information visit: <a href="http://www.drugchecking.ca/">www.drugchecking.ca</a></li>
        <li>   Remember, smoking substances can still lead to overdose, take measures to prevent overdose.</li>
        <li>   Avoid using different drugs at the same time or using drugs and alcohol together.</li>
        <li>   Don’t use alone. Leave the door unlocked. Tell someone to check on you.</li>
        <li>   Test by using a small amount, then go slow.</li>
        <li>   Carry a Naloxone kit and know how to use it.</li>
        <li>   Use at overdose prevention or supervised consumption site if one is near you. Know the signs of overdose and how to respond</li>
        <li>   Recognize the signs of an OD: slow or no breathing, gurgling or gasping, lips/fingertips turning blue, difficult to rouse (awaken), non-responsive.</li>
        <li>   Call 9-1-1 immediately</li>
        <li>   Open airway and give rescue breaths</li>
        <li>   Give naloxone (Narcan) if you have it.</li>
      </ul>
