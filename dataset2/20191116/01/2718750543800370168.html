      <h1>Disney+ Will Let You Watch <i>The Simpsons</i> in the Correct Aspect Ratio After All</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T01:16:56+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 01:16</time> by <a rel="author">Halle Kiefer</a></address>
      <p>If the first thing you attempted to watch among <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/Disney+/">Disney+</a>’s vast and overwhelming new offerings is <i>Simpsons</i> episodes that you loved as a kid, well, we can’t blame you. We also can’t blame you for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRq1Ksh-32g">grumbling</a> when the platform’s decision to stream <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/the-simpsons/"><i>The Simpsons</i></a> in today’s widescreen 16:9 aspect ratio inadvertently <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2019/11/the-simpsons-disney-plus-aspect-ratio-1202189361/">cropped out certain sight gags</a> from the series, which was largely made in a 4:3 aspect ratio. Among the true fans who noticed was Dorkly’s Tristan Cooper, who <a href="https://twitter.com/TristanACooper/status/1194298167824650240">posted examples</a> of sadly lost and distorted <i>Simpsons</i> images on Twitter. Well, according to Disney+, they have heard your plea and want to reassure you that you will be able to watch <i>The Simpsons</i> in the correct aspect ratio. Eventually.</p>
      <p>“We presented <i>The Simpsons </i>in 16:9 aspect ratio at launch in order to guarantee visual quality and consistency across all 30 seasons,” a Disney+ spokesperson said in a statement to Vulture on Friday. “Over time, Disney+ will roll out new features and additional viewing options. As part of this, in early 2020, Disney+ will make the first 19 seasons (and some episodes from Season 20) of <i>The Simpsons</i> available in their original 4:3 aspect ratio, giving subscribers a choice of how they prefer to view the popular series.” The show switched over to HD widescreen during its 20th season, meaning you will be able to see every <i>Simpsons</i> episode as God and Matt Groening intended. In a few months or so.</p>
