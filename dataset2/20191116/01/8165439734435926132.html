      <h3>Disciplinary action</h3>
      <p>Nearly 500 gardaí have faced disciplinary action in less than three years.</p>
      <p>Breaches of discipline can result in officers being sacked or having their wages cut.</p>
      <p>The figures show there has been a decline in disciplinary cases within the force over the past three years.</p>
      <p>The Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan released the information to Fianna Fáil's Jim O' Callaghan following a request.</p>
      <p>They show 190 officers were punished in 2017, 167 in 2018 and so far this year 136 members of on An Garda Síochána have been disciplined.</p>
      <p>The numbers also include 14 sergeants or higher ranked gardaí this year.</p>
      <p>As part of the "<a href="https://www.garda.ie/en/about-us/a-policing-service-for-the-future/">Policing Service for the Future"</a> report, a Discipline Review Committee has been set up to oversee the process.</p>
