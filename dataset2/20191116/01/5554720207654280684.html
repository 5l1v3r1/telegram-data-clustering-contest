      <p>Amitabh Bachchan recently joking revealed his fear of being physically assaulted by wife Jaya Bachchan while hosting his popular quiz show <i>Kaun Banega Crorepati. </i>Bachchan’s quirky response to a contestant from Jharkhand came days after the Bollywood megastar had regaled the KBC audience with his epic response on public praise for daughter-in-law Aishwarya Rai’s eyes.</p>

      <p>Addressing the contestant, Bachchan said, “I’ve heard that you will soon get your life partner. Let me tell the viewers that there’s a secret behind choosing his life partner. He (the contestant) said that the height of his future wife matched his and then he decided to marry her.”</p>
      <p>Bachchan continued, “Brother, I can’t speak about the height of a couple. Else, the one at home (Jaya Bachchan) will start using the rolling pin.” Once again, Bachchan’s quirky reference to the height gap between him and Jaya Bachchan caused a loud round of laughter from the audience.</p>
      <p>Bachchan is 6’2″ tall while Jaya Bachchan is believed to be 5’2″ tall.</p>
      <p>The Bollywood megastar has often used his popular quiz show to make funny references to the members of his family. Not too long ago, he had pretended to complain after a contestant praised the eyes of his daughter-in-law and former Miss World Aishwarya Rai Bachchan.</p>
      <p>A woman contestant from Delhi, Pooja Jha, was recently asked to name the film in which Shah Rukh Khan and Aishwarya had played the roles of twins. The contestant correctly answered the film <i>Josh, </i>but also added that she was a big fan of Aishwarya adding that she loved her mesmerising eyes. This had evoked quite a funny reaction from Bachchan, who <a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/entertainment/amitabh-bchchans-epic-reaction-to-kbc-contestants-comments-on-daughter-in-law-aishwarya-rais-eyes/270288/">complained</a> that the contestant had not given him compliments for his eyes. He, however, promised to convey the contestant’s compliments for his <i>bahu </i>to Aishwarya. “I am disappointed (that you didn’t praise my eyes) but I will inform her (Aishwarya),” said Bachchan.</p>
      <p>Days later, a reference to Jaya Bachchan on KBC had left Amitabh Bachchan, also known as Big B, quite sheepish. This was after KBC host asked the contestant a question on the Sanskrit word for gold.</p>
      <p>The question<i> </i><a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/entertainment/not-just-daughter-in-law-aishwarya-rai-even-mention-of-wife-jaya-bachchans-name-on-kbc-makes-amitabh-bachchan-sheepish/270946/">read</a>, “Which of these words also means ‘gold’ or ‘golden’ in Sanskrit?” The options were Hema, Leela, Jaya and Sushma. Bachchan informed that the correct answer Hema. The Bollywood megastar said, “Hema also means ‘earth’ or a beautiful woman. That’s why Hema Malini was named Hema. We shall not discuss the others.” Bachchan was referring to his wife Jaya Bachchan. His last line caused laughter from the audience.</p>
