      <p>The Kerala Police have launched a probe to track the source of a letter which was sent in the name of Maoists to the Vadakara police with a threat to manhandle Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan.</p>
      <p>The letter, which is said to have been posted from Kasaragodâ€™s Cheruvathur, said retaliatory action would be taken against Mr. Vijayan to get justice for slain Maoists.</p>
      <p>Enclosed with the handwritten letter were a few pro-Maoist leaflets threatening a sub-inspector at the Perambra police station. The writer, who identified himself as a leader of Maoists Urban Action Team, accused the sub-inspector of beating up people on various occasions and warned him too of retaliatory action.</p>
      <p>Police sources said the letter would be handed over to a special investigation squad. A case was registered under Section 189 (threat of injury to public servant), 153 (provocation with intent to cause riot) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code.</p>
