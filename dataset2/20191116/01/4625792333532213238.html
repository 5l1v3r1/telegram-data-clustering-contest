      <p>The 16-year-old suspect in a Santa Clarita, California, school shooting that killed two students and injured three others has died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.</p>
      <p>The gunman, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/alleged-california-high-school-shooter-identified">identified as</a> Saugus High School sophomore Nathaniel Berhow, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/us/santa-clarita-shooting-motive.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur">died</a> on Friday, complicating investigators' attempts to nail down a motive in the shooting.</p>
      <p>On Thursday morning, Berhow arrived at school on his 16th birthday, pulled out a semi-automatic .45-caliber pistol from his backpack, and <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/multiple-victims-reported-in-shooting-at-california-high-school">began firing</a> before shooting himself in the head. Prior to turning the gun on himself, he shot five students, and two of them, a 16-year-old female victim and a 14-year-old male victim, died at the hospital from their wounds.</p>
      <p>Berhow was also taken to a nearby hospital, where he was reportedly in "grave" condition as of Friday morning. However, he later succumbed to his injury, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/15/us/california-school-shooting-friday/index.html">said</a> Friday evening.</p>
      <p>According to authorities, the gunman was silent as he shot his fellow students and appeared to have selected them at random.</p>
      <p>“It doesn’t appear he had any interaction with anyone,” Sheriff Alex Villanueva said. “He was just standing by himself, at one point walked to the center of that quad area — dropped the backpack — withdrew with a firearm and just started firing.”</p>
      <p>There is no indication that the shooter's mother was aware he had a gun. Investigators are working on tracing the weapon, along with others found at his home, some of which are not registered. While police haven't identified a motive, they believe the attack was planned.</p>
      <p>“It wasn’t a spur-of-the-moment act,” Villanueva said.</p>
