      <h1>Nita Ambani’s current and future daughters-in-law Shloka Mehta and Radhika Merchant compete with each other in ‘red-hot’ avatars</h1>

      <p>Shloka Mehta recently set the internet on fire with her ‘red-hot’ avatar after she was spotted doing away with her no-makeup rule and looking stunningly glamorous in a single shoulder red lace mini dress with floral diamond danglers paired with white Greek-style slippers. While everyone’s focus was on Shloka and her sister-in-law Isha Ambani, who too was seen making a big fashion statement with a sleeveless <i>sharara</i>-saree designed by Anamika Khanna, not many paid attention to Radhika Merchant, the future daughter-in-law of Mukesh and Nita Ambani.</p>

      <p>Radhika, who’s believed to be in a relationship with Anant Ambani, too had gone for an Anamika Khanna outfit as the fashion designer took to Instagram to share her outfit designed for the pre-wedding function of Arjun Kothari, nephew of Mukesh and Nita Ambani. Radhika was seen slaying in her breathtakingly all-red ensemble. Her dress was the combination of Isha’s <i>sharara-saree </i>and the red colour <a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/entertainment/shloka-mehta-in-never-seen-before-red-hot-avatar-as-in-laws-mukesh-and-nita-ambani-welcome-aishwarya-rai-mira-rajput-at-home/272472/">chosen by Shloka.</a> What made her dress even more unique was the red cape. A fashion diva that she is, Radhika did not leave it here. She accessorised it with chandelier earrings and a layered neckpiece.</p>

      <p>While both Shloka and Radhika were seen slaying with their red-hot dresses, it was difficult to choose a winner here. What was, however, clear that Bollywood guests such as Aishwarya Rai and Mira Rajput were simply no match to the current and future Ambani daughters-in-law.</p>
      <p>Anamika shared Radhika’s look for the pre-wedding function of Arjun Kothari on Instagram.</p>

      <p>Unlike Radhika, Shloka had also opted for a second outfit with celebrity makeup artist and hairstylist Ojas Rajani working on her ‘red hot’ look. Once again, Anamika Khanna, was the person responsible for designing Shloka’s lace lavender separates with a similar colour long-line lace jacket and an emerald and diamond choker.</p>
      <p>Shloka got married to Akash Ambani in March this year, while Radhika is set to marry Anant.</p>
