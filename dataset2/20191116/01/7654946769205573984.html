      <p>Myles Garrett has one less thing to worry about now.</p>
      <p>The Browns defensive end, already <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/myles-garrett-suspended-indefinitely-for-browns-steelers-fight/">indefinitely suspended by the NFL</a> for<a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/myles-garrett-uses-helmet-to-clock-mason-rudolphs-head-in-fight/"> whacking Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph with his own helmet</a> at the end of a testy Thursday night matchup, won’t see any legal ramifications.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/1195491413124952066">NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport,</a> Rudolph won’t be taking any legal action against Garrett, considering the situation to be “exclusively an NFL matter.”</p>
      <p>The only way Garrett would face criminal charges is if the quarterback filed a police report, according to Cleveland police. As of Friday afternoon, Rudolph has not done so, Sgt. Jennifer Ciaccia told The Post.</p>
      <p>In the aftermath of the melee, which saw three players earn suspensions and the Browns and Steelers fined $250,000 apiece, Rudolph’s agent, Tim Younger, told ESPN that he was “gathering all the information” before deciding a course of action.</p>
      <p>Garrett’s attack “appeared to meet the elements of the crime of assault,” according to Sports Illustrated’s legal expert, Michael McCann. McCann, however, cited the lack of past examples of violence on the field reaching the courtroom. Garrett’s attack has been most commonly compared to a 2006 incident in which Titans defensive tackle Albert Haynesworth stomped his cleats on the unprotected face of Cowboys center Andre Gurode.</p>
      <p>“Gurode immediately needed medical attention and would require 30 stitches under his right eye,” McCann wrote. “He went on to suffer prolonged headaches and blurred vision. It was textbook criminal assault and had nothing to do with football, but there was no charge.”</p>
      <p>Garrett, the No. 1-overall pick in the 2017 draft, has been sidelined at least through the end of this season. He released a statement Friday apologizing for the incident and calling it “a terrible mistake.”</p>
