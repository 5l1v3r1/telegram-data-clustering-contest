      <p><b>Lille</b> forward, Victor Osimhen’s value has increased three times more than the actual price he was purchased by Lille in the summer.</p>
      <p>According to a research by The International Center for Sport Studies, the stock of the Nigeria international has risen thrice more than his original value in just three months at the club since joining from Belgian side, Sporting Charleroi.</p>
      <p>Osimhen, who joined Lille for €12m, has been valued between €40m and €50m, making him the second most expensive player in the club behind French international Jonathan Ikone,, who is valued between €70m – €90m.</p>
      <p>The CIES figures was confirmed in a tweet by LOSC Actualité.</p>
      <p>“After three months of competition, CIES has re-assessed the values of the LOSC players. Jonathan Ikoné is still the most expensive player in the squad (70-90M €) but Victor Osimhen saw his value triple in just three months (40-50M € ).”</p>
      <p>Osimhen has scored nine goals in 17 appearances in all competition for the French side.</p>
