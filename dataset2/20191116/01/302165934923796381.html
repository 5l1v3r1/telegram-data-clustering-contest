      <p>WASHINGTON, Nov 16 — The United States is set to extend a license allowing US companies to continue doing business with Chinese technology company Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, the <i>New York Times</i> reported yesterday, citing people familiar with the deliberations.</p>
      <p>An earlier reprieve issued by the US Commerce Department is set to expire on Monday, but the administration of US President Donald Trump is expected to extend it for a period of time, according to the report, which added that the decision could change given the ongoing trade talks between the US and China.</p>
      <p>Huawei and the Commerce Department did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment outside regular working hours. — Reuters</p>
