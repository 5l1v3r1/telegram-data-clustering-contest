      <p>SINN Féin deputy leader Michelle O'Neill has said her party stands ready to restore the Stormont institutions in the new year but she insists that any credible deal must include an Irish language act and reform of the petition of concern.</p>
      <p>The Mid Ulster MLA was speaking at the Millennium Forum in Derry last night, where up to 2,000 Sinn Féin members are gathering for the party's ard fheis.</p>
      <p>Today Ms O'Neill will face an unprecedented challenge to her deputy leadership from former Stormont education minister John O'Dowd.</p>
      <p>The contest, which was triggered when the Upper Bann MLA revealed in August that he was seeking nominations for the vice-president's position, is expected to be a low key affair.</p>
      <p>Mr O'Dowd previously said he was looking forward to “debate across the party and island”.</p>
      <p>However, the party's ard chomhairle subsequently ruled that there would be no hustings events, while the candidates were discouraged from speaking to the media about the contest.</p>
      <p>It was unclear last night whether Mr O'Dowd will be making his case to delegates during today's conference.</p>
      <p>The result is expected to be announced tonight prior to leader Mary Lou McDonald's speech, around 8.30pm.</p>
      <p>Ms O'Neill said last night that her party was “fully invested in and committed to the Good Friday Agreement”, including the element of the accord referring to a border poll. She said the 1998 agreement could not be “cherry-picked”.</p>
      <p>Ms O'Neill said the agreement also required an “assembly that works for everyone”, describing the current impasse as “unsustainable and unacceptable”.</p>
      <p>The Stormont assembly collapsed in January 2017 when the late deputy First Minsiter Martin McGuinness resigned in the wake of the RHI scandal.</p>
      <p>The Sinn Féin northern leader also accused the DUP of being complicit with the Conservative government in a strategy that had “stripped our public services of investment”.</p>
      <p>She said if a restored executive was to be credible then it needed to deliver on “public sector pay, safe staffing levels in the health service, economic policies that deliver prosperity for all and that invests in rural communities, and an appropriate welfare mitigation package”.</p>
      <p>She again reiterated her party's desire for an Irish language act and reform of the petition of concern, which enables the vetoing of assembly votes with the 30 signatures.</p>
      <p>An executive must also “deal with the legacy of the past”, she said.</p>
      <p>“The British government's refusal to deal properly with legacy issues is hindering reconciliation and wider political progress,” she said.</p>
      <p>“Three years after the RHI (Renewable Heating Incentive) scandal brought the assembly down people deserve and demand a functioning government and genuine power-sharing.”</p>
      <p>Ms O'Neill said agreement to restore the institutions had been reached in February last year but that the DUP “regrettably walked off the pitch”.</p>
      <p>“I stand ready to form a credible executive,” she said.</p>
      <p>“A new assembly and a new kind of politics in the new year is what I am working towards.”</p>
