      <h1>Man convicted on drug charges escapes jail time</h1>

      <p>A 30-year-old man who was caught possessing and selling drugs has been warned further offending will send him to jail.</p>
      <p>Darley man Jay May faced the County Court in Ballarat on Friday to appeal a 14 day jail sentence handed to him at the Bacchus Marsh Magistrates Court in July.</p>
      <p>Judge Michael Bourke re-sentenced May to a 12 month community corrections order with a requirement he complete 200 hours of unpaid community work and undergo assessment and treatment for drug use.</p>
      <p>"If you breach this you will come back before me - I couldn't see how I could not send you to jail," Judge Bourke said.</p>
      <p>Crown prosecutor Andrew Moore said police executed a search warrant at May's Darley home in February where they found a set of scales, methamphetamine and zip lock bags in a bag hidden on top of a water tank.</p>
      <blockquote>The fact you are not going to jail does not mean this is not a serious offence.<cite>Judge Michael Bourke</cite></blockquote>
      <p>The court heard police found two bags of cannabis in the bedroom and two zip lock bags containing cocaine and ecstasy in a safe inside the wardrobe.</p>
      <p>Records on May's mobile phone indicated he was selling drugs.</p>
      <p>In admissions at the police station, May said he was a 'functioning drug addict', had used cocaine during a bucks weekend and had bought cannabis to try but did not like it.</p>
      <p>Arguing against a jail sentence, defence lawyer Tony Danos said May had no relevant priors, worked as a concreter, his drug addiction had reduced since he was arrested and he was no longer selling drugs.</p>
      <p>"I don't see any point sending you to jail for two weeks," Judge Bourke said.</p>
      <p>"You should be punished for specific deterrence...The fact you are not going to jail does not mean this is not a serious offence."</p>
      <p>May was charged and convicted of trafficking methamphetamine, trafficking cannabis, possession of ecstasy and possession of cocaine.</p>
