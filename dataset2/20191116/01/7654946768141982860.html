      <p>The alleged gunman who <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/14/santa-clarita-shooting-students-recall-harrowing-escape-from-gunfire/">killed two teens at Saugus High School</a> in Los Angeles County and then turned the gun on himself has died from his self-inflicted bullet wound to the head, officials said Friday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/14/santa-clarita-high-school-shooter-identified-as-nathaniel-berhow/">Nathaniel Berhow</a>, 16, was pronounced dead at about 3:30 p.m., local time, on Friday, a day and a half after the shooting on the grounds of the Santa Clarita high school, the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department said.</p>
      <p>He died with his mother at his bedside, the department said.</p>
      <p>Berhow, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/santa-clarita-gunman-was-experienced-shooter-with-easy-access-to-firearms-cops/">an experienced gunman</a>, had first killed two classmates — 14-year-old Dominic Blackwell and 15-year-old Gracie Anne Muehlberger — and injured three others before firing his last bullet into his head and dropping his empty gun, police said.</p>
      <p>All six shootings happened in under a minute, authorities said.</p>
      <p>“As far as we know the actual targets were at random,” <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/santa-clarita-gunman-was-experienced-shooter-with-easy-access-to-firearms-cops/">County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said Friday</a>.</p>
      <p>“He was just standing by himself, walked to the center of the quad center, dropped the backpack, and just started firing.”</p>
      <p>Authorities recovered several firearms from the suspect’s home, as well as six firearms that were registered to the shooter’s late father, identified as Mark Berhow.</p>
