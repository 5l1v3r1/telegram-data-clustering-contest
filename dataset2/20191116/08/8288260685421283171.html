      <p>Coventry City boss Mark Robins has admitted Sam McCallum could leave the League One club in the January transfer window.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> are among the sides keeping an eye on the 19-year-old full-back who has impressed for the Sky Blues this season.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/monumental-bid-aston-villa-sent-16993483">Robins has previously told interested clubs it will take a ‘monumental’ bid to prise McCallum away</a> but concedes there’s nothing he can do if the right money is offered.</p>
      <p>Scouts from the Premier League and Championship have flocked to St Andrew’s to watch McCallum play this term as Coventry eye promotion.</p>

      <p>Asked if his side can hold onto the teenage talent, Robins told <a href="https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/sport/football/transfer-news/coventry-city-transfer-news-mccallum-17263092">CoventryLive:</a> “I would like to think yes, but I am not stupid.</p>
      <p>“Money talks and it’s not any different at any other club, regardless of where they are in terms of stature and division.</p>
      <p>“If someone comes in with the right money then people will be available, there’s no two ways about it.</p>
      <p>“But I am not looking to move anyone on. I am looking to maintain, first and foremost, and then add if I can."</p>
