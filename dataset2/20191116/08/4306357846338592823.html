      <h1>Jurgen Klopp makes Liverpool FC transfer admission about Zlatan Ibrahimovic</h1>
      <h2>Liverpool FC boss Jurgen Klopp says he might have signed Zlatan Ibrahimovic if the striker hadn't played for Man United already</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T08:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thesportreview.com/topics/football-transfers/" target="_blank">Transfer Agent</a></address>
      <h3>Jurgen Klopp says he might have considered recruiting Zlatan Ibrahimovic for Liverpool FC if the veteran striker wasn’t an ex-Manchester United player.</h3>
      <p>The former Sweden international is a free agent after the 38-year-old left Major League Soccer outfit LA Galaxy earlier this week.</p>
      <p>Ibrahimovic finished his MLS career with a respectable return of 53 goals in 58 games in all competitions.</p>
      <p>Manchester United have been linked with a move to re-sign Ibrahimovic given their striker crisis despite offloading Ibrahimovic to LA Galaxy less than two years ago.</p>
      <p>The former FC Barcelona striker scored 29 goals in 53 outings for the 20-time English champions during the Swede’s 18-month stint under Jose Mourinho at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>When Klopp was asked whether he’d consider signing Ibrahimovic to add more depth to his Liverpool FC squad, the Reds manager told <i>Sportbladet</i>, as quoted by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/zlatan-ibrahimovic-hadnt-played-man-utd-liverpool-might-considered-says-jurgen-klopp-11142629/">Metro</a>:</p>
      <p>“If he had not played for Manchester United before, then we might have considered him.</p>
      <p>“No, but I’m not even sure he wanted to play here. We’re a pretty intense team.</p>
      <p>“With that said, I couldn’t have had more respect for Zlatan. I love his whole career, love his efforts, love his confidence.</p>
      <p>“While it may not always be right, it is entertaining anyway. He’s a fantastic character and I really hope he doesn’t stop playing football. The world will miss him too much.”</p>
      <p>Liverpool FC are sitting at the top of the Premier League table following a 3-1 victory over defending champions Manchester City.</p>
      <p>The Reds are eight points ahead of their closest rivals Leicester City and Chelsea FC at the top of the table.</p>
      <p>The Merseyside outfit will make the trip to Crystal Palace in their next Premier League fixture on Saturday 23 November.</p>
      <p>Liverpool FC haven’t won the Premier League title but have finished in second place on four different occasions.</p>
