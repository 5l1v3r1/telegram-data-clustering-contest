      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T08:15:29+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 08:15</time> by <a rel="author">Will Stewart, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/will-stewart/</a></address>
      <p>A Russian MMA fighter labelled a freak’ for his Popeye arms has begun surgery to remove petroleum jelly he had used to bulk-up his biceps.</p>
      <p>Kirill Tereshin, 23, was warned he could die or face amputation if he failed to get rid of the fake muscles.</p>
      <p>Surgeon Dmitry Melnikov revealed Tereshin had injected three litres of a cheap Vaseline-like jelly - and not synthol as previously claimed.</p>
      <p>The "bodybuilder" was persuaded to undergo urgent treatment by WAG Alana Mamaeva, 32, a leading campaigner for victims of botched plastic surgery.</p>
      <p>She is seen on a video calling him by his nickname ‘Bazooka’ and describing how his artificial muscles were “horrible, horrible” compared to his "slim" body.</p>
      <p>The campaigner raised funds for his surgery, which she attended, and said: "We are going to try and help this young man.”</p>

      <p>Former army conscript Tereshin told her before the operation: “I am ready, I am even not afraid."</p>
      <p>Earlier he told how he did not have money for surgery.</p>
      <p>"For now I have removed the damaged tissues from one arm only," said Dr Melnikov from Sechenov Moscow State Medical University.</p>
      <p>"Petroleum jelly saturates the muscles, under skin tissues and the skin itself.</p>

      <p>"All that has to be removed, but we need to keep the vein, nerves and other functions of the limb."</p>
      <p>He warned: “Petroleum jelly is not designed for injection, only external application.</p>
      <p>"Kirill injected about three litres into each arm.</p>
      <p>"It saturated the muscle tissues, blocked blood flow.</p>
      <p>"As a result the tissue dies and gets replaced with a scar which is as tough as a tree, you can even knock on it and hear the usual sound. We have removed all this.</p>
      <p>"He had high fever, strong pain, and weakness."</p>

      <p>He was "lucky" that the damage had remained only in his limbs and not spread to the rest of his body.</p>
      <p>"Petroleum jelly affects the whole body, kidneys in particular," he said.</p>
      <p>"I think Kirill did not fully realise the consequences of what he had been doing."</p>
      <p>He underwent a "complex" two hour operation and faces “several more surgeries”, said the medic.</p>
      <p>The doctor warned that women are increasingly using petroleum jelly for cheap beauty fixes.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately, this is not a rare case," he said.</p>

      <p>"In the whole our country women are often injected with petroleum jelly and so get disfigured.</p>
      <p>"Instead of expensive plastic surgery, they agree to petroleum jelly injections and later come to us to remove it.</p>
      <p>"We have seen petroleum jelly injected into breasts, buttocks, and other parts of the female body.</p>
      <p>"We are warning that it is extremely dangerous.</p>
      <p>"It is traumatic for the body, leading to huge scars and without medical treatment it ends even with death."</p>

      <p>Another Russian doctor had warned him he “very likely” faced amputation of his arms if if did not undergo surgery.</p>
      <p>A video shows Tereshin’s mother spoon-feeding him in hospital after the surgery.</p>
      <p>Last month he was defeated in an MMA bout by Oleg Mongol, 43, a fighter twice his age.</p>

      <p>It was a second humiliation for Tereshin who earlier this year was floored by Russian slapping champion Vasiliy 'The Dumpling' Kamotskiy.</p>
      <p>The ex-soldier has also lost his fiancée model Olesya Malibu, 28, real name Olesya Kozhevnikova, who had urged him to enlarge his buttocks, say reports in Russia.</p>
      <p>Recently he was seen with another unidentified woman.</p>
