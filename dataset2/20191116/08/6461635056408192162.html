      <h3>Barcelona summer signing Antoine Griezmann has responded to criticism regarding his slow start to life at the Catalan club…</h3>
      <p>Antoine Griezmann has admitted the fact that he has found it hard to adjust to life at the Spanish champions but promised the Catalan fans that he is going to meet their expectations of him soon. There was a lot of flare surrounding Barca’s new summer signing Antoine Griezmann when he was presented at the Camp Nou and the Catalan faithfuls had high expectations from the French forward, but Griezmann’s performances have been below par. The World Cup winner has found the back of the net just <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.co.in/antoine-griezmann/leistungsdatenverein/spieler/125781"><b>4 times in 15 appearances</b></a> for Barcelona and his statistics are way below than what they were at this stage of the competition last year, when he was at Atletico Madrid.</p>
      <p>In yesterday’s match against Moldova, Antoine Griezmann was deployed in a more central role as opposed to the role he plays at Barca where he is often left alone on the flanks and finds it difficult to connect with his strike partners. In the post match press conference, Griezmann was asked about his life at Camp Nou and the Frenchman said the following to say to <a href="https://rmcsport.bfmtv.com/football/equipe-de-france-griezmann-savait-que-ca-allait-etre-dur-au-barca-1806472.html"><b>RMC Sport</b></a>:</p>
      <blockquote>” It is certain that playing on the axis is better for me. I have my bearings. I’ve been managing this position for years and years. I have a new club. I have to adapt. I am still learning. I knew on arrival that it was going to be hard, I knew it very well. “</blockquote>
      <p>Griezmann flourished under Diego Simeone’s 4-4-2 formation where he played a more central role. However, he has found it difficult to fit into Barcelona’s 4-4-3 style. His performances have dipped but the fans are hopeful that their new signing will soon get back to his old form. France coach Didier Deschamps also was supportive of Griezmann and said that he was not worried about the players lackluster performances for Barcelona. Per <a href="https://rmcsport.bfmtv.com/football/equipe-de-france-griezmann-savait-que-ca-allait-etre-dur-au-barca-1806472.html"><b>RMC Sport</b></a>, Deschamps had the following to say:</p>
      <blockquote>“He is there because he has the talent and the quality, he is used in positions different from those he can occupy in the French team, he has to adapt , the other players too. it is a very big club so there is a lot of expectation and demand. “</blockquote>
      <p>Griezmann is set to feature for France in their final Euro qualifying game as they face Albania and will return to Barcelona with the fans expecting him to perform well in the upcoming key fixtures against the likes of Real Madrid in La Liga and Inter Milan and Dortmund in the UEFA Champions League.</p>
      <p>Will Griezmann find his form soon enough to make a huge impact on the team?</p>
