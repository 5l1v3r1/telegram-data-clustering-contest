        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 16 – Detectives from the office of Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) are interrogating a group of university students who were arrested at Thika Road Mall (TRM) in company of a lady who had claimed to have been abducted.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 19-year-old Kenya Medical Training College (KMTC) student called her brother alleging to have been abducted by an unknown people who demanded Sh20,000 as ransom.</p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>The student’s brother sent her money via MPESA, but upon receiving the money she switched off her phone prompting her brother to report the matter to police.</p>
      <p>“The lady immediately switched on her phone &amp; called the mother saying she had just been dropped at Galleria Mall in Karen. Upon arrest, it was established that the Sh 20,000 was still in her Mpesa account,” DCI tweeted Friday night.</p>
      <p>After commencing the investigations, the lady’s phone signal was traced to the Mall where she was found partying.</p>
      <p>“Detectives launched forensic trails leading them to the party venue. While observing their reactions, the boyfriend was contacted and asked to go and record a statement with police on the issue.”</p>
