        <b>What just happened? Mahira Sharma who always yelled at Sidharth Shukla and did not like him even one bit in Bigg Boss 13 is now saying that he isn't as bad as she considered him to be. We are fainting</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mahira Sharma and Sidharth Shukla have been staunch enemies since the beginning of Bigg Boss 13. However, it seems she has had a change of heart. In a recent promo, we see her saying some good words about Sidharth Shukla. Boy, we never thought we'll see such a moment in the journey of Bigg Boss 13 and we bet, you'll be shocked to see it too. Mahira stated that she has started liking him and that he isn't as bad as she considered him to be.</p>
      <p>This happens during the task when contestants are supposed to give tags to other housemates. When choosing the 'entertainer' of the house, Mahira Sharma picks Devoleena's name and states that she is liking all the flirty things Devo is doing with Sidharth Shukla. Further, she states that Sidharth Shukla isn't as bad as she thought he is and states, 'ab mujhe voh bohot ache lagne lage hain'. Sidharth Shukla is in shock of course after listening to this and it seems quite a few ladies said good things about Sidharth. Like a proud man, he asks Paras Chhabra to change his place and sits near Mahira Sharma. Watch the video below.

      <p>Anything can happen in Bigg Boss 13 house and we are only expecting things to get better for Sidharth Shukla from here on. Last Weekend Ka Vaar, Salman Khan had bashed everyone for targetting Sidharth Shukla and it seems Mahira Sharma has taken it quite seriously. Paras Chhabra, we guess it is time for you to pull up your socks and your greatest support has found a new interest in Mr Shukla. </p>
