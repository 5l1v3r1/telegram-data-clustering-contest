      <p>ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) - Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari claimed that Pakistan will have a new Prime Minister by next year, and the PPP will form a public government.</p>
      <p>Speaking to media after the meeting of Core Committee, Bilawal said that the PPP fulfilled all its promises made to Maulana Fazlur Rehman. “We participated and addressed the Azadi March”, he expressed, adding that the PPP’s public campaign will remain intact.</p>
      <p>PPP Chairman said that the PPP will observe Foundation Day (Youm-e-Tasees) in Kashmir this year and will announce the future course of action there.</p>
      <p>The scion of Bhutto dynasty asserted the economic situation of the country is not moving into the right direction. He went on to say that those who are claiming that the economic situation of Pakistan is fine, they should look at the misery through which the unemployed people are suffering.</p>
      <p>Bilawal Bhutto expressed that the PPP wants democracy. He continued asserting that our foreign policy is going through a historic crisis. He added, “The burden of inflation should be less on the poor and more on the powerful, but the comman man of country has been laden with the effect of inflation.</p>
      <p>“Pakistanis are bearing the burden of government’s incompetency.</p>
      <p>“Ever since the ineligible government has came into power, the economic situation has worsened from bad to abysmal," he maintained.</p>
