      <p>On a day the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/jawaharlal-nehru">Jawaharlal Nehru</a> University Vice-Chancellor appealed to teachers for their “cooperation” in ending the protests on campus, the JNU Students’ Union decided to “reclaim” the administrative block, making it the nerve centre of their protests.</p>
      <p>V-C M Jagadesh Kumar in his appeal also asked teachers to “convince students that the changes in hostel charges are not only reasonable but vital for the financial viability of our hostels”.</p>
      <p>“I write to you to seek your cooperation in maintaining a peaceful academic atmosphere in JNU campus. The persistent agitations and protests by a section of students have adversely affected the university’s normal academic and research activities,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Such persistent protests involving occupation of the Administration Building, defacing of walls and floors and indulging in brawls with security guards and breaking open doors have maligned the image of JNU seriously,” he added.</p>
      <p>Kumar said the administration would “like to engage in a dialogue and discussion, but the process and form of any such interaction cannot be dictated through coercion and illegal methods”.</p>
      <p>The JNUSU meanwhile held a meeting Friday with Student-Faculty Committee members and decided to have continuous mobilisation at the administrative block. “At each time, some students should be here. We cannot surrender the administrative block,” JNUSU general secretary Satish Yadav announced at the protest meeting, where students narrated their “plight” over the hostel fee hike.</p>
      <p>One such student, Soumyatarini Mishra, said: “I come from a poor family. When I was joining MA, people told me ‘why are you studying, you should earn’. I earned money so I could study. By asking me to pays Rs 7,000 a month as hostel fee, you are killing my dreams…”</p>
