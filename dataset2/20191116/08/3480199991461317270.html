      <p>Britain’s second and newest aircraft carrier, HMS Prince of Wales, is set to sail into its home port of Portsmouth for the first time.</p>
      <p>The £3.1 billion warship left Rosyth dockyard in Scotland, where it was built, in September before undergoing eight weeks of sea trials.</p>
      <p>Shipping lanes into Portsmouth Harbour will be closed and an air exclusion zone put in place for the arrival of the 65,000-tonne ship.</p>
      <p>The carrier’s sister ship, HMS Queen Elizabeth, also based at Portsmouth Naval Base, is currently on a visit to the US to undergo trials of the F35 fighter jets ahead of its first operational deployment planned for 2021.</p>
      <p>Major upgrade work has been carried out at the jetties at Portsmouth so that the two giant ships can berth next to each other.</p>
      <p>During their 50-year service, the two 280-metre long aircraft carriers can be pressed into action for various work such as high intensity war fighting or providing humanitarian aid and disaster relief.</p>

      <p>They have been built by the Aircraft Carrier Alliance (ACA) – a partnership of BAE Systems, Babcock, Thales and the Ministry of Defence.</p>
      <p>Overall, six shipyards around the UK – Appledore, Birkenhead, Govan, Portsmouth, Rosyth and Tyne – have been involved in building various parts of the carriers.</p>
