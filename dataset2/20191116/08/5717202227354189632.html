      <h1>Could reported Domagoj Vida interest end make up January decision for Newcastle star?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T08:45:17+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 08:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/will-butcher/" target="_blank">Will Butcher</a></address>
      <p>Newcastle United are reportedly interested in raiding Besiktas in the January transfer window to sign commanding centre-back Domagoj Vida – but could a move for the Croatian powerhouse see an in-form Toon star wave goodbye?</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.takvim.com.tr/spor/2019/11/14/besiktasinhirvat-yildizi-vida-paylasilamiyor-ingiliz-kulupleri-onu-istiyor">According to Takvim</a>, Newcastle are interested in the 30-year-old who played in the World Cup final against France for his country in 2018. The Toon are not alone in their interest for the powerhouse.</p>
      <p>Indeed, Norwich City, West Ham United and Brighton are also said to be keen on the former Dynamo Kiev ace. He has a contract at Besiktas until the summer of 2022 – and it remains to be seen what kind of fee clubs would have to pay for Vida.</p>
      <p>Newcastle already have a multitude of options at centre-back, including Jamaal Lascelles, Federico Fernandez, Paul Dummett, Florian Lejeune, Fabian Schar and Ciaran Clark. The latter’s future, though, remains up in the air.</p>
      <p>The Ireland international has been in excellent form for Newcastle this season, after coming into the side at the start of October. Previously, he had not played a single minute of Premier League football during 2019-20.</p>

      <p>But he started and finished the 1-0 win over Manchester United and has kept his place since. In that time, Newcastle have turned a corner under Bruce, picking up 10 points from a possible 15 – and Clark has scored two crucial goals.</p>
      <p>Clark was asked if considered leaving Newcastle, and he said he did before Bruce told him to wait and see what the situation is like in January (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50416188">BBC</a>): “”He said we would see how the first part of the season goes and re-assess that come January.”</p>
      <p>Clark has broken into the team but has only made five appearances. With Lejeune close to a return, it remains to be seen if the Irishman will still have his place in the side. The signing of Vida, then, would see him kicked out of the starting eleven.</p>
      <p>Signing Vida, then, should make up £5million signing (<a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11678/10521446/newcastle-sign-defender-ciaran-clark-from-aston-villa">Sky Sports</a>) Clark’s mind ahead of the January window.</p>
