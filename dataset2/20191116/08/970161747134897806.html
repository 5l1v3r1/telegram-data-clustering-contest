      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> hope their willingness to loan Erling Haaland back to Red Bull Salzburg will aid their bid for the Norwegian sensation.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ole-gunnar-solskjaer/">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> dispatched his personal scout, Simon Wells, to watch over the 19-year-old earlier this season as United intensify their bid to sign the striker.</p>
      <p>Haaland has attracted attention from all over Europe after an astonishing start to the season in which he’s bagged 26 goals in 18 appearances.</p>
      <p>The teenager has already scored four hat-tricks this term and Solskjaer had hoped his personal relationship with the forward would see him pick Old Trafford.</p>

      <p>The United boss handed Haaland his first team debut at Molde in 2017 and the Red Devils are desperate to strengthen their frontline.</p>
      <p>However, the club know they are far from the only suitors for Haaland’s signature and United have attempted to usurp their competitors by offering to loan Haaland back to Salzburg to complete a move for the forward.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-utd-line-up-200m-20889527">The Mirror</a> claim United would allow Salzburg to keep Haaland for the remainder of the season, provided they can agree a deal in January.</p>
      <p>United hope that will see them keep ahead in the race against the likes of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/fc-barcelona/">Barcelona</a> and Real Madrid.</p>
      <p>But the club fear Haaland is more interested in a move to Spain.</p>
