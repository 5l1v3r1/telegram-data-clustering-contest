      <h1>Another Indian fighter jet crashes</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T08:05:18+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 08:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/7761/news-2/" target="_blank">News Desk</a></address>
      <p>A fighter jet of the Indian Navy crashed on Saturday near Goa, reported <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/navy-s-mig-jet-crashes-in-goa-pilots-eject-safely/story-7MtboiGOQoFgnOk3jhTqJP.html">Indian media</a>.</p>
      <p>The aircraft, a MIG-29k, crashed shortly after take-off. Both pilots ejected and a search and rescue operation is underway.</p>
      <p>The Indian armed forces suffer from chronic spare shortages and lax aircraft maintenance standards.</p>
      <p>The MiG-29K is an aircraft carrier version of the MiG-29. The aircraft which crashed today was deployed at Indian Navy Air Station Hansa Dabolim and deputed for aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya.</p>
      <p>According to Indian Navy, the trainer aircraft crashed as it suffered an engine fire. Indian media, however claimed that it was due to a probable bird strike.</p>

      <p>In September, an Indian Air Force (IAF) MiG-21 crashed near the Gwalior Air Force Base in Madhya Pradesh.</p>
      <p>According to another Indian media <i><a href="https://www.news18.com/news/india/frequent-crashes-obsolete-technology-downhill-road-for-mig-21-indias-flying-coffin-2053117.html">report</a>,</i> more than 170 Indian pilots and 40 civilians have been killed in air crashes since 1970.</p>
      <p>All these crashes involved fighter planes and most were attributed to MiG-21 jets, which have had 210 accidents from 1963-2015.</p>

      <p>The MiG-21 is also the aircraft shot down by the Pakistan Air Force in February this year, which led to the capture of IAF Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman.</p>
      <p>It is a Soviet-era single-engine multi-role fighter and ground-attack aircraft that was first inducted into the IAF in the 1960s and upgraded to the MiG-21 Bison version in 2006.</p>
