      <h1>'Wales have made me feel at home' says Nottingham Forest youngster</h1>
      <h2>Teenage sensation Brennan Johnson will hope to add to his Under-21 caps next week</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T08:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Barry Cooper</a></address>
      <p>Brennan Johnson’s long-term international future may yet to be decided, but the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> youngster has just one thought on his mind - and that's making his family proud.</p>
      <p>Having been watched by <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/no-surprise-england-monitoring-nottingham-3307717">England boss Gareth Southgate</a> recently after making a positive impact on the first team scene at the City Ground this term, the 18-year-old currently plies his trade for<a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/brennan-johnson-scores-wales-under-3293863"> Wales’ Under-21 side</a>, though until he earns a senior cap, the Three Lions could still tempt him their way.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/forget-messi-ronaldo-brennan-johnson-2740998">Johnson</a> is currently away on international duty with the Welsh side ahead of Tuesday’s qualifier with Bosnia in Wrexham, and for now, all talk of what may happen in the future is off the agenda.</p>
      <p>"I did play for England, but I can't fault Wales," the highly-rated Forest youngster told BBC Sport Wales, having represented the Three Lions at Under-16 and Under-17 level.</p>
      <p>"It's been really good.</p>
      <p>“Wales have made me feel at home and I am loving playing for them.</p>

      <p>"The Welsh link is all my mum's side of the family, who I have been really close with all my life.</p>
      <p>"I always see them - they always come round. They are all Wales fans and they have been telling me to play for Wales.</p>
      <p>"I am enjoying coming away with the Under-21s and hopefully things can progress. Hopefully I can keep making them proud."</p>
      <p>Johnson, whose father David came close to playing for Wales two decades ago before making his senior debut for Scotland, says he’s got the full support of the ex-Forest star.</p>
      <p>"It would have been nice if he had played for them as well,” said Johnson.</p>

      <p>"But he has liked seeing me play for Wales. He has been to watch the games and he is really happy with me playing for Wales."</p>
      <p>Johnson came off the bench late on against Derby County last Saturday, and in continuing to <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/brennan-johnson-wales-nottingham-forest-3540309">be a part of Sabri Lamouchi’s first team picture at Forest</a>, hopes that will see him develop both on the domestic and international front, with a senior call-up to Ryan Giggs squad firmly on his mind.</p>
      <p>“You can see the lads who were playing for Wales Under-21s last year and have now progressed to the senior side,” he continued.</p>
      <p>"It's really good to be part of that."</p>
