      <p>Russian nuclear tech corporation <a href="http://www.biblioatom.ru/anniversary75/documents/">Rosatom has declassified a secret Soviet goverment document</a> ordering the design for the USSR's first cruise missile - P-5 "Pyatyorka" (NATO codename SS-N-3C Shaddock) back in 1955.</p>
      <p>The previously classified order, as well as many others, was published by the company ahead of the 75th anniversary of the Russian nuclear industry, which will be celebrated next August.</p>

      <p>The Ministry of Medium Machine-Building Industry's order required the experimental design bureau No. 52 (OKB-52, currently known as NPO Mashinostroyeniya) to create 40 guided nuclear missiles and to place them on submarines.</p>
      <p>P-5 was launched in 1957, and inducted into service by the Soviet military in 1959, becoming the first sea-based cruise missile in the world. It was capable of сarrying a blasting charge or nuclear charge and could hit deep inside an enemy's heartland.</p>
