      <h1>Almost Christmas Ensemble enchants the crowd</h1>
      <h2>The Lowveld Chamber Music Association (LCMA) once again delivered an enticing performance on Sunday afternoon with their “Almost Christmas” concert.</h2>

      <p>MBOMBELA – Sweet harmonious melodies filled the air at the Penryn chapel during the light classical music performance.</p>
      <p>Talent from the Lowveld Community Orchestra, the Laudate Choir, the Sempre Vino Ensemble and several soloists came together in a musical marvel.</p>

      <p>Exceptional performances of the evening were Janette Rottcher’s performance of “Chopin’s Scherzo in B minor”, which drew a standing ovation from the crowd, and Sempre Vino’s performance of Fauré’s “Libera Me”.</p>
      <p>The “Libera Me” performance featured Conroy Scott, a baritone from Cape Town, who flew up especially for this concert. “I am very impressed with the organisation of this concert; I did not think that there would be so many people,” Scott told Lowvelder. He sang in Europe for six years before returning to South Africa two years ago. “He also plays the double bass for the Cape Town Philharmonic Orchestra, and is actually a qualified mechanical engineer,” Walter Fourie, the director of LCMA, explained.</p>

      <p>The programme for the afternoon was a wonderful blend of Christmas standards and light classical fare. Apart from Rottcher and Scott, the other soloists were Lusanti Brundyn, who played the violin, performing “Suite Italienne”, Cassandra Monnig, who played the flute, soprano Gugu Mahlalela, and Jurgens Naudé, a French horn player.</p>
      <p>Theresa Prinsloo, Alayna Kunzel and Karla Brits also performed on their harps, and Kimmy Skota, who sang for several years with André Rieu, performed “Gounod’s O Divine Redeemer”.</p>
      <blockquote>“Lowvelders can be very privileged that such excellent musicianship is on their doorstep,” Fourie stated.</blockquote>
      <p>Santie Barrish, who attended the concert, described the concert as fantastic, especially Scott’s performance in conjunction with the choir with whom<br/>he sang.</p>
