      <h1>Where to find the best Black Friday deals for 2019 - our predictions for the UK sale</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T08:52:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 08:52</time> by <a rel="author">Lela London, Katie Russell</a></address>
      <p>Come November 29, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/black-friday-2019-deals-when-best-sales-start-uk-shops/">Black Friday </a>will once again present shoppers with major discounts on TVs, tech, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/style/best-fashion-deals-black-friday-clothing-sale-uk-zara-hm/">fashion</a> and quite literally everything in between. Last year, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/amazon-black-friday-2019-best-deals-when-early-sale-start-uk/">Amazon</a> even sliced the price on <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Silver-Lilly-Pizza-Sleeping-Bag/dp/B073PMVBKV?tag=telegraphaffiliate-21&amp;ascsubtag=customid-21">a pizza-shaped sleeping bag</a>. Thankfully, there is much more to Black Friday 2019 than food you can sleep in - but we can definitely expect some exciting deals to come.</p>
      <p>Though the sales event was once a four-day affair (starting on the last Friday of the month and wrapping up with Cyber Monday’s online deals), Black Friday now lasts more than a week, with some of the best deals starting as early as Friday 22.</p>
      <p>The extra days and deals, chosen at each participating retailer's discretion, mean sale-loving shoppers are truly spoilt for choice. This year, perhaps, more than ever...</p>
      <h3>Where can I find the best Black Friday deals?</h3>
      <p>As you’re already bound to know, Amazon leads the pack. The retail giant is practically synonymous with Black Friday as it not only brought Black Friday to the UK, but it offers the widest range of deals in the widest range of categories. Each day of its Black Friday sales period starts with a handful of checkout-worthy new deals, but thousands of products are discounted across all categories throughout.</p>
      <p>Like most retailers, Amazon champions the most exciting products with the biggest discounts, including <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/best-tv-deals-black-friday-2019-uk-cyber-monday-sales/">TVs</a>, tech, mobile phones, appliances, laptops, tablets, consoles, smart devices and more. The choice across new tech alone can be overwhelming, so we advise you get acquainted with your general options (and the specifications which will work for you) beforehand.</p>
      <p>Cross-category retailers generally have the best deals on the nation’s most-wanted products, though there are exceptions. In recent years Argos, Currys, Very, AO, eBay and other familiar names have worked especially hard to beat Amazon’s best prices, becoming Black Friday favourites in their own right. They’re also a particularly good starting point for home appliances, which is worth keeping in mind if you have old kitchen equipment or white goods you’ve been meaning to replace.</p>
      <p>For specialty products or services, however, your best bet is often the place you’d choose to purchase them in the first place. For example, the best phone deals tend to be found directly through mobile network operators (ee, Three, Vodafone, etc) while the best travel deals are normally found through airlines directly (Air New Zealand, Cathay Pacific, Emirates, etc).</p>
      <p>It is always worth keeping an eye out on deals from smaller and category-specific retailers in the lead up to Black Friday, as well. Many try to ‘beat’ the crowd, marking Black Friday deals down weeks in advance, meaning you could get something special, like a high-end winter coat, directly from a designer at a fraction of the cost.</p>
      <h3>Our predictions for the best UK Black Friday deals</h3>
      <h4>Apple products</h4>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/apple-black-friday-cyber-monday-deals-best-predictions-2019/">Apple products</a> rarely receive major price cuts as the brand tries to keep the cost of its products as consistent as possible. Nonetheless, the demand for iPhones and AirPods reigns supreme, so there will definitely be deals kicking around. </p>
      <p>If you come across a Black Friday deal on an Apple product, it is likely a loss-leader for a retailer who has sacrificed its margin to get customers through the door. Because of this, you will be lucky to find recent Apple product releases more than five per cent off. Older releases are a smarter choice, as many have similar technology but can be found for 15-20 per cent off their retail price. For example, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Apple-27-inch-Retina-display-quad-core/dp/B072N2FQRH?tag=telegraphaffiliate-21&amp;ascsubtag=customid-21">this 5K Retina Apple iMac</a> has already been reduced from £1,949 to £1,325 - a major saving. on major tech, just because it’s the previous model.  </p>
      <h4>New mobile phones</h4>
      <p>If your mobile phone contract is up anytime soon, it may be worth waiting until Black Friday week to renew. New smartphone releases are one of Black Friday’s big-ticket draws and many of the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/predictions-best-mobile-phone-deals-black-friday-cyber-monday/">best deals on new handsets</a> come with a phone contract attached. We predict the Samsung Galaxy S10, Google Pixel 3, Sony Xperia 1 and Huawei P30 Pro will feature prominently.  </p>
      <p>Less bothered about the latest tech but still want to upgrade on Black Friday? You’re in luck. The last-gen models from most major manufacturers are sure to be seen at their lowest-ever prices. Recently, Amazon even priced the Samsung Galaxy S9 down from £999 to £699.</p>
      <h4>Video games and gaming consoles, particularly PS4 and Xbox One</h4>
      <p>Games and their associated consoles are often packaged together for Black Friday. Last year, the best value was found in a deal bundling an Xbox One S 500GB console with Doom, Wolfenstein 2, The Evil Within 2 and a NOW TV Movie pass, all for £229.99. This deal was found at <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=INH%2FSVPJb1Y&amp;mid=42508&amp;u1=customid&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.game.co.uk%2F">GAME</a>, and they are generally considered to be the best Black Friday <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/best-gaming-deals-black-friday-2019-sale-nintendo-ps4-xbox-games/">gaming deals</a> retailer. Amazon also offer a wide range of bundles and deep-pocket deals on individual games, ranging anywhere from £10 to £40 for popular titles. </p>
      <h4>4K TVs</h4>
      <p>Retailers know customers have high expectations from their TVs, so they make a habit of highlighting their high-tech models over everything else during Black Friday. This year, most TV deals should come in the shape of 4K Ultra High Definition (or ‘UHD’) models, like this 65-inch HDR-active model from LG (<a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3090&amp;awinaffid=73846&amp;clickref=customid&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.very.co.uk%2Flg-lg-65um7660planbsp65-inch-4k-active-hdr-ultra-hd-tv-with-advanced-colour-enhancer%2F1600371149.prd%3Futm_campaign%3Dcontent%26awc%3D3090_1567675967_4fb04ff66f360d225433a895a4423028%26aff%3Dawin%26affsrc%3D73846%26cm_mmc%3Dawin-_-73846-_-Editorial%2BContent-_-0_0%26utm_source%3Dawin%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_term%3DTelegraph%252Eco%252Euk_73846%26utm_content%3Dna">already £500 off at Very</a>). Sticking with brands you already know and trust, like Samsung, Toshiba and Panasonic, is wise as you are assured their technical claims (UHD, HDR, AI, etc) are upheld.</p>
      <p>We expect to see 4K TVs in every size imaginable as well as trend-led TVs (think curved screens, LED backlighting, etc) on sale this year.</p>
      <h4>Amazon devices</h4>
      <p>It wouldn’t be Black Friday without banner upon banner promoting Amazon’s own products, and this year should be no exception. Amazon devices are expected to retail at their lowest-ever prices for Black Friday 2019, making it the perfect time to grab the Fire TV Stick, Kindle or smart speaker you’ve been eyeing up.</p>
      <p>Last year, the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Amazon-Echo-Show-With-Screen-2nd-Generation-Alexa/dp/B0793G9T6T?tag=telegraphaffiliate-21&amp;ascsubtag=customid-21">Echo Show (2nd Gen) </a>was packaged with a Phillips White Hue Bulb and reduced from £219.99 to £169.99. We expect a similar tech combo this year at an even lower price point. ​Other Echo devices and Fire Tablets also feature regularly, often between £20 to £50 off. </p>
      <h4>Big retailers: Currys PC World, Argos and John Lewis</h4>
      <p>To stake a claim in the sales event, high street favourites Currys PC World, Argos and John Lewis go above and beyond for their Black Friday customers. </p>
      <p>Both John Lewis and Currys price-matches many of their competitors' best deals (making Currys an easy one-stop-shop for tech and, at John Lewis, higher-end products), while Argos is a go-to for smart tech and consoles (last year's Black Friday sale marked their biggest-ever day for video gaming). </p>
      <p>So far, Currys has already started offering discounts, in its "Why Wait?" sales, which started on Wednesday, November 13. The retailer has already offered significant savings on Smart 4K Ultra HD televisions, as well as the Fitbit and even a Nintendo Switch bundle. Even better, Currys has promised that, if the price for a product further drops during their Black Friday sales, you will be refunded the difference.</p>
      <p>See detailed predictions for <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/currys-pc-world-black-friday-deals-best-predictions-2019-sale/">Currys' Black Friday deals</a>, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/argos-black-friday-2019-deals-best-sale-predictions-toys-smart-home/">Argos' Black Friday deals</a> and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/john-lewis-black-friday-2019-deals-best-sale-predictions-headphones/">John Lewis' Black Friday deals</a> in their respective guides. </p>
      <h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
      <p>The sheer volume of deals available over the Black Friday and Cyber Monday period means we have to rely on both current sales and previous years’ sales to get a real sense of what’s to come. </p>
      <p>Generally, smaller tech items are a dime a dozen; smart watches, FitBits, headphones and beyond. Even beauty tech, like the impressively innovative Dyson Airwrap, which has already been reduced from £699 to £399 for the first time.</p>
      <p>Home tech and appliances are also bound to offer some of the best Black Friday deals, as they have in years past. We predict multi-retailer price wars on video doorbells like Nest and Ring, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/recommended/home/best-coffee-pod-machines/">coffee pod machines</a> like those from Nespresso, and KitchenAids. Perhaps even a robot vacuum or two to hit their lowest-ever price; the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/iRobot-Roomba-895-Connected-Programmable/dp/B07D7HV51G?tag=telegraphaffiliate-21&amp;ascsubtag=customid-21">iRobot Roomba</a> is already discounted more than half price.</p>
      <p>Naturally, we will keep you up to date with the best Black Friday deals over the coming weeks, as well as 24-hour updates over the sales period itself. So sit back and relax as we do the hard work for you.  </p>
