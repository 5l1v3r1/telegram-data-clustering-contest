        <b>Three people arrested in relation to the abduction of Kevin Lunney have been released without charge.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The two men and one woman were released in the early hours of Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>A mother and son were among those being questioned since Thursday over the incident in September.</p>
      <p>A file will now be prepared for the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP).</p>
      <p>Mr Lunney, an executive of Quinn Industrial Holdings, was attacked as he was driving from work to his home in Kinawley, Co Fermanagh.</p>
      <p>The 50-year-old was beaten and tortured by three men in an attack that lasted for about two and a half hours.</p>
      <p>He also said he had the letters 'QIH' cut into his chest with a Stanley knife.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.newstalk.com/news/kevin-lunney-describes-ordeal-kidnapping-assault-group-men-921899">Recounting the ordeal</a> </b>earlier this month, Mr Lunney feared he would never see his wife and children again.</p>
      <p>He was driven across the border to Co Cavan - to what he described as an "old farmyard space" and taken inside a horse box.</p>
      <p>He said the man with the Stanley knife said: 'You know why you're here. It's about QIH and you're going to resign.'</p>
      <p>Mr Lunney recounted: "He started to run the Stanley knife under each nail, deep enough so it was sore and painful.</p>
      <blockquote>"They poured bleach over my hands, then rubbed them over with a rag really hard."</blockquote>
      <p>The kidnappers then stripped Mr Lunney, cutting the clothes from his body and leaving deep cuts on his legs and arms.</p>
      <p>They then poured more bleach over the rest of his body and used a rag to rub it into the wounds.</p>
      <p>Mr Lunney said he was in excruciating pain: "I was screaming, I think. I don't remember."</p>
      <p>The kidnappers then told him they had been watching him, his family and the other Quinn directors.</p>
      <p>His leg was hit with what he thinks was a baseball bat or short fence post.</p>
      <p>Mr Lunney was then dumped at the side of a road in Co Cavan - 22 miles away from where he was abducted.</p>
      <p>Last week, Gardaí and the PSNI launched a cross-border taskforce to investigate the attack and the wider campaign - which included a number of death threats.</p>
      <p>The task-force was announced following a series of raids on both sides of the border and in England.</p>
      <p>Gardaí searched 12 locations south of the border while the PSNI searched five locations in the North.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, British police searched a home in Derbyshire.</p>
      <p>Police said one of the main suspects in the investigation, Irish man Cyril McGuiness, died during that raid.</p>
