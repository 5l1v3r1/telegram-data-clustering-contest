      <p>The stars of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/strictly-come-dancing/">Strictly Come Dancing</a> have reportedly been ‘banned’ from partying after the show due to fears for their safety while out and about.</p>
      <p>The show has moved over to the seaside town for their annual special in one of ballroom dancing’s most iconic locations, but <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/23/strictly-come-dancing-ups-blackpool-security-death-threats-attacks-pros-10791778/">security has been stepped up to keep the celebrities and their professional partners safe</a>.</p>
      <p>According to The Sun, more security has been put in place and anyone involved in the show has been told to ‘stay behind closed doors’.</p>
      <p>A source told the paper: ‘There have been a couple of issues in the past, so bosses have decided to act and banned the stars from hitting the town after the show.</p>
      <p>‘To soften the blow, they’ve agreed to throw a bash at the hotel where they are all staying. It’s safer and means they can be properly looked after at all times and enjoy the night without concerns.</p>

      <p>‘They’ve brought in additional security to ensure there are no problems while the show is away from its usual home at the studios in Elstree.’</p>
      <p>It comes after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2016/11/22/strictlys-gorka-marquez-breaks-silence-on-blackpool-attack-which-knocked-out-two-of-his-teeth-6274200/">professional dancer Gorka Marquez was attacked on a night out in Blackpool in 2016,</a> which resulted in him losing two teeth.</p>

      <p>It was also reported that the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/09/strictly-come-dancing-bosses-have-increased-security-after-celebrity-cast-and-dancers-received-death-threats-11071588/">BBC called in a private security firm to provide round-the-clock protection</a> for the stars after getting death threats from viewers earlier in the month.</p>
      <p>After Mike Bushell and Katya Jones were repeatedly saved from being voted off, Mike was subjected to vile messages from trolls, who also targeted his wife.</p>
      <p>Judge Shirley Ballas was also targeted for some of her judging decisions, including to vote off Dev Griffin and Dianne Buswell from the show.</p>
      <p>With Strictly’s trip to Blackpool’s Tower Ballroom being a highlight of every series and something the contestants strive to achieve, it’s no wonder that they’re making every effort to ensure it goes off without a hitch.</p>
