      <h1>Gateshead man found with sick images of kids on his phone and tablet</h1>
      <h2>Stephen Earl pleaded guilty to possessing indecent images, which he collected over a two-year period</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T08:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Sara Nichol</a></address>
      <p>A man was found to have vile images of children on his mobile phone and tablet.</p>
      <p>Stephen Earl had collected the pictures over a two-year period and some were category A, the most serious kind, a court heard.</p>
      <p>The sick images were discovered after <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/northumbria-police">police</a> raided the 56-year-old's home address in Crowly Avenue, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/gateshead">Gateshead</a>, and seized electronic devices.</p>
      <p>In total, 10 pictures were found, with three being in category A.</p>
      <p>Now, Earl is facing a possible prison sentence after he pleaded guilty to three counts of making an indecent image of a child.</p>
      <p>Oriana Frame, prosecuting at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/courts">South Tyneside Magistrates' Court</a>, said the photos were collected between March 2016 and July 2018.</p>
      <p>She said: "The defendant's home address was searched as a result of a warrant where he lives with his wife.</p>
      <p>"Multiple devices were seized as part of that search and they were analysed by police digital forensic examiners. Images were found on two devices - a mobile phone and a tablet.</p>
      <p>"Both belonged to the defendant and he admitted they were his."</p>
      <p>The court heard that three category A images, five category B and two category C were discovered on the two devices.</p>
      <p>Miss Frame submitted that the case was too serious to be sentenced at the magistrates' court.</p>
      <p>District Judge Davies agreed and Earl was released on conditional bail to next appear at Newcastle Crown Court on December 4.</p>
      <p>Full mitigation will be heard on that occasion.</p>
