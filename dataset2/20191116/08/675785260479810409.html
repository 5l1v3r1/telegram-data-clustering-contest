      <h1>Woman's tip for making mouldy shower tiles look good as new - without scrubbing</h1>
      <h2>A woman has shared the simple but very effective way she managed to remove the mould from the grouting in her bathroom, without doing any scrubbing</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T08:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Courtney Pochin, https://www.facebook.com/courtneypochinmirror/?modal=admin_todo_tour</a></address>
      <p>It's no secret that mould grows in warm, damp areas which have poor air circulation.</p>
      <p>One place it often thrives in is bathrooms, growing around windows or on the grouting around shower tiles.</p>
      <p>Trying to get rid of it can be incredibly tricky, but one woman claims to have found a solution.</p>
      <p>In a post on a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/cleaning">cleaning</a> tips and tricks <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> group, an unnamed woman revealed she'd found a simple hack for removing mould without doing an intense scrubbing - and it only cost around £2 to do.</p>

      <p>The woman initially posted a photo of her mouldy grouting on the group, asking fellow members for suggestions on how to get them looking good as new.</p>
      <p>Many people responded to her post, sharing ideas, including using toilet bowl cleaner and just re-sealing the tiles.</p>
      <p>After trying a few of the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/life-hacks">hacks</a> out, she finally found one that really did the trick, and all she needed were cotton wool and bleach to do it.</p>
      <p>The woman claims she soaked a pieces of the cotton wool in the cleaning product and packed them all around the edges of the tiles.</p>
      <p>The cotton wool was left on the tiles overnight and by the morning, the difference was incredible.</p>
