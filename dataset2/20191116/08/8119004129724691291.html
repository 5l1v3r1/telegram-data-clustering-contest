        <b>Bangladesh have plunged to a humiliating innings defeat to India inside three days of in the opening Test match at Indore on Saturday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Tigers began the day trailing India by 343 runs after the hosts declared on their overnight score of 493-6.</p>
      <p>But the visitors were skittled out for just 213 as seamer Mohammed Shami and off-spinner R Ashwin ran through the batting line up with only Mushfiqur Rahim (63) standing in the way.</p>
      <p>Mushfiqur made the most of a reprieve earlier in his knock to be 53 not out, having added 56 runs with Mehidy Hasan Miraz 38.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh's efforts to stave off defeat were dealt an early blow when opener Imrul Kayes (6) was bowled by seamer Umesh Yadav with the score at 10.</p>
      <p>Shadman Islam (6) fell shortly afterwards as a length ball by Ishant Sharma sneaked through his defence and crashed into the stumps.</p>
      <p>Captain Mominul Haque was the next to go after being trapped lbw by Mohammad Shami for 7.</p>
      <p>Mohammad Mithun followed the skipper back to the pavilion after a quick-fire 18, including four boundaries, when he miscued a short-ball by Shami straight to Mayank Agarwal at mid-wicket.</p>
      <p>A 63-run partnership between Mushfiqur Rahim and Liton Das offered some encouragement for Bangladesh supporters on an otherwise miserable day for the tourists.</p>
      <p>But hopes of a fightback were nipped in the bud when R Ashwin removed Liton for 35.</p>
      <p>Kolkata hosts the second and final match, which will be the first day-night test for both sides, from Nov 22.</p>
