      <h1>What Mets told Carlos Beltran regarding sign-stealing scandal</h1>

      <p>The Mets are playing by MLB’s investigative rules and they have told their center of the storm, new manager Carlos Beltran, just that.</p>
      <p>General manager Brodie Van Wagenen has told Beltran the Mets will let MLB handle the electronic sign-stealing scandal involving the 2017 Astros and Beltran, industry sources told The Post on Friday.</p>
      <p>On Thursday in Scottsdale, Ariz., at the GM meetings, Van Wagenen told reporters: “Anything that happened, happened with another organization, with Houston. … I have no idea if anything did or did not [occur], but at this point, I don’t see any reason why this is a <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/14/carlos-beltran-makes-astros-sign-stealing-accusations-very-much-a-mets-problem/">Mets situation</a>.”</p>
      <p>Van Wagenen and the Mets, according to those sources, wanted to make it clear to Beltran that MLB’s investigation must be completed before the Mets can do anything or react in any way. MLB is driving the investigative process and that is why Van Wagenen said what he said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The Mets simply know they cannot get in the middle of all this at this point. They do know this could become a serious situation that impacts the Mets if MLB decides on certain penalties, but they have to stand clear. Right now, this is in baseball’s hands, but it could become a messy situation for the Mets, and they are prepared to deal with the consequences if there are any for Beltran.</p>
      <p>MLB figures to go after higher-ups. Beltran was in the final year of his 20-year playing career in 2017. They are aiming much higher up on the Astros food chain.</p>
      <p>Still, Beltran is smack in the middle of the situation that involves the use of a center-field camera and a banging of a garbage can to alert hitters of coming off-speed pitches, according to information first revealed by The Athletic.</p>
      <p>The Athletic, citing sources, reported that Beltran (the primary designated hitter on the 2017 Astros) and Alex Cora (then Houston’s bench coach and now Boston’s manager) played a key role in devising the illegal sign-stealing system that their former pitcher Mike Fiers and sources revealed to The Athletic. In that system, The Athletic reported, the Astros are alleged to have used a center-field camera relayed to a monitor near the dugout to steal signs in real time.</p>
      <p>Beltran, on Thursday, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/14/carlos-beltran-doubles-down-as-mets-unfazed-over-mlb-sign-stealing-scandal/">doubled down </a>on what he told The Post’s Joel Sherman <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/12/carlos-beltran-astros-stole-signs-but-not-illegally/">earlier in the week</a>, saying in a text message to The Post:</p>
      <p>“I’m not concerned. There’s nothing illegal about studying your opposite team. We all have the same opportunity to look out for information and tendencies. I love and respect the game. I will be a student of it and apply all the lessons.”</p>
      <p>Now this is all in MLB’s investigative hands. The Mets are onlookers at this point. They just happened to hire the manager in the middle of the electronic sign-stealing furor.</p>
      <p>On Twitter late Friday, the Athletic’s Ken Rosenthal reported: “MLB investigators are moving quickly. They are now interviewing players.</p>
      <p>Mike Fiers is among those the league has contacted, sources tell me and @EvanDrellich. Fiers spoke to The Athletic about the #Astros’ sign-stealing operation.’’</p>
      <p>From there, MLB will move on to those named in the scandal, including the Mets’ new manager and what he says to them in their investigation.</p>
      <p>The Mets must wait and see where this all leads.</p>
