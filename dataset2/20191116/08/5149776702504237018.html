      <p>The <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/environment">mudslide</a> in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/mansfield">Mansfield</a> that has left 60 people unable to return home was "completely unforeseen" by the local authority, despite consultations being carried out before and after the homes were built.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/mansfield-mudslide-triggered-torrential-rain-3517304">mudslide, on November 7</a>, led to homes in Berry Hill Quarry on Bank End Close and Stone Bank being evacuated.</p>
      <p>Residents of 19 properties face a two-week wait until they are allowed home and are currently living in accommodation provided by Mansfield District Council.</p>
      <p>Plans for the site dating back to 2007 show that consultations led to the installation of a buffer-zone along the back of properties parallel to the cliff face.</p>
      <p>A consultant from Fairhurst - a specialist contractor who have been advising the council on how to manage the scene - said that the only risks that were recognised on the site were of "small scale rock fall."</p>

      <p>But the buffer zone was unable to mitigate the destruction of residents' gardens last week as a mudslide was "not anticipated to happen on this scale."</p>
      <p>The situation has meant the council has had to access dedicated emergency funding from the Government under the Bellwin scheme, which provides support across the country in case of disasters or emergencies.</p>
      <p>The scheme provides local authorities with financial assistance if they have to spend more than 0.2 percent of their annual budget in response to certain situations. It has helped the council remove around 1,300 tonnes of debris.</p>
      <p>Hayley Barsby, chief executive of Mansfield District Council, said: "As a result of the floods that happened last week and the incident here last Thursday, Mansfield has been identified as an area where help can be given through the Bellwin scheme.</p>

      <p>"The original planning application was in 1999 and things were considered more closely from 2007 onwards. Consultations were carried out to see what the dangers could be and as the houses were being built, a buffer zone was created behind them along the cliff as a safety measure."</p>
      <p>Call handlers from the council have been calling evacuated residents everyday to see if there is anything they need from their houses or any other assistance they need.</p>
      <p>Council workers have also provided information on how residents can access Nottinghamshire County Council's Flood Hardship Fund that allows those who have had to evacuate due to the weather to apply for a one-off payment of Â£120.</p>
      <p>Paul McMillan, geo-technical consultant with Fairhurst, added: "The failure mechanisms recognised when the houses were being built and afterwards recognised there only could be "small scale rock fall". The buffer zone was put there to catch the rocks that did fall.</p>

      <p>"What happened last week was completely unforeseen. It was a combination of things that had built up, including the weather. It was not anticipated to happen on this scale.</p>
      <p>"We are currently looking at ongoing preventative measures now we know that this can happen.</p>
      <p>"The vegetation can actually be helpful to prevent these kinds of slips because it soaks up the water along the top so we haven't removed it all. We are trying to find the balance.</p>
      <p>"The options for the permanent preventative measures that need to be taken are currently being discussed with various teams."</p>

      <p>Temporary measures being taken to allow the safe return of residents include installing concrete blocks and creating a temporary stone road behind people's homes to access areas where debris needs to be removed.</p>
      <p>The chief executive of Mansfield District Council added she is consulting with the Government over the next steps.</p>
      <p>She said: "Our initial objective is to facilitate and ensure people's safe return to their homes and then in the longer term we will be putting peoples garden's back in place.</p>
      <p>"The reality is that we do not want people in their gardens with the dangers present."</p>
      <p>The council is currently has teams looking at how the long-term prevention of a similar incident can be ensured.</p>
