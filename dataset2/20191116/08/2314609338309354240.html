      <p>Pakistan's raw pace attack have been given a wake-up call ahead of the Test series against Australia after struggling to fire against a youth-laden Cricket Australia XI outfit.</p>
      <p>In reply to Pakistan's 7(dec)-386, the CA XI were reeling at 2-6 in the two-day tour match at the WACA Ground after Mohammad Abbas and 19-year-old Muhammad Musa struck early in scorching heat on Saturday.</p>
      <p>But Pakistan struggled to make inroads from that point on, with a 122-run stand between Jonathan Merlo (78) and Matthew Spoors (54no) frustrating the visitors.</p>

      <p>The CA XI outfit, featuring just five players with first-class experience, finished at 7-245, with the match ending in a draw.</p>
      <p>Bradley Hope finished unbeaten on 50.</p>
      <p>Pakistan batsman Imam-ul-Haq went off the field for treatment after jarring his neck while fielding a ball during the morning session. Although the injury didn't appear serious, he will be monitored ahead of the first Test at the Gabba, starting next Thursday.</p>
      <p>The mercury soared past 40C on Saturday, and Pakistan made the hottest of starts to the day after declaring on their overnight score.</p>
      <p>Jake Carder fell for an 18-ball duck when he chopped Abbas onto his stumps.</p>
      <p>And Jayden Goodwin made just six before he edged Musa behind, leaving the home side in early strife.</p>

      <p>But the prospect of Pakistan ripping through the rest of the CA XI line-up were thwarted by fighting efforts from Merlo and Spoors.</p>
      <p>The brave display was in stark contrast to the powerful Australia A outfit, who got rolled by Pakistan for 122 at Optus Stadium earlier in the week.</p>
      <p>That performance sent a powerful message to Australia about the talent of Pakistan's pace attack.</p>
      <p>But they haven't been able to back it up with a glut of wickets against the CA XI.</p>
      <p>Naseem Shah, a 16-year-old who has been likened to Dennis Lillee, unleashed some ferocious bouncers on Saturday but wasn't able to snare a wicket during the first two sessions.</p>
      <p>Abbas (2-22 from 14 overs) was excellent, while Musa (1-24 from 10 overs) was economical.</p>
      <p>Imran Khan, who snared 5-32 against Australia A earlier in the week, and 19-year-old Shaheem Afridi are yet to bowl in the warm-up match, with Pakistan rotating through 15 players.</p>
      <p>Asad Shafiq's unbeaten 101 was the highlight of day one, with teenage spinner Lloyd Pope (5-100) also impressing.</p>
