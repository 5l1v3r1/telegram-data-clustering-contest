      <h1>Bounty Hunter: Savatiano makes off with Newcastle's $1million race</h1>

      <p>James McDonald couldn’t believe how easy Savatiano did it as she broke the track record to take the inaugural $1 million The Hunter at Newcastle on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The classy mare landed a series of big bets as she started a $4.60 favourite and was finally on the right end of a result at Newcastle.</p>

      <p>She had been a runner-up in the Newmarket Handicap and Tibbie Plate at her previous two visits, both to Princess Posh, but this time there would be no denying her as she crossed from an outside gate, led, controlled and then demoralised her rivals.</p>
      <p>“From the 600 I never thought I was going to lose,” McDonald said.</p>
      <p>“I just cruised across and never looked like losing. I was surprised how easy we got to the front and then I didn’t go that hard.</p>
      <p>“I couldn’t believe it when I asked her to go, how she just put them away. That is a top-class mare.</p>
      <p>"It was easy really and she was very comfortable.”</p>
      <p>McDonald open up the engine on Savatiano before the turn and she skipped three and four lengths clear. The only chaser from then was Tactical Advantage ($7), but the Street Cry mare held a 1½ length margin on the line with Bon Amis ($17) third, which had track the winner all the way, another three-quarters of a length away.</p>
      <p>It gave Godolphin trainer James Cummings the two features after Asiago won the Spring Stakes and topped a great spring campaign for Savatiano, which had won at group 2 level in Melbourne.</p>
      <p>"She was a very fit mare. It was a fabulous win and very deserving horse,” Godolphin representative Darren Beadman said.</p>
      <p>"She is quite electrifying. Just pure speed. Not a lot of horses can sustain that gallop, but she is able to; she conserves her energy mid-race. She has got a lot more substance to her now.</p>
      <p>"James wasn't overly positive early but just kept her in the race and from the 1000m he was able to back off the speed, to give her a chance. She relaxed nicely and she was really strong late. She loves the track and the course here.”</p>
      <p>It capped a wonderful day at Newcastle with more than 6000 punters turning up to give Racing NSW' extended spring another big tick.</p>
      <p>There were no excuses behind the winner. Nash Rawiller felt fleetingly that he was a winning chance when he got clear at the 300m mark back in the field on Tactical Advatage.</p>
      <p>“I was trying to find runs at the top of the straight, and when he got clear I thought he was a winning chance until I saw where the winner was,” Rawiller said. “He went super.”</p>
      <p>The Australian Bloodstock horse gave the syndicators placings in all three features – the Spring Stakes, Max Lees Classic and The Hunter.</p>
      <p>“This raceday is unreal, he’s a genius, Peter V’landys,” Australian Bloodstock’s Jamie Lovett said. “We are proud Novocastrians and, although we haven’t won a race, we have run three seconds, we feel like winners.</p>
      <p>“This bloke could be a Stradbroke horse next year.”</p>
      <p>Bon Amis was brave stretching out to 1300m for Broadmeadow trainer Jason Deamer but he found the class of Savatiano hard to match when she sprinted.</p>
      <p>“I surprised when the winner sprinted how quickly she left us. Even before the straighten she was gone but my bloke held on well,” Jason Collett said.</p>
      <p>Deamer was delighted to run third.</p>
      <p>“He didn’t let us down. He had been going very well into the race, but he just missed that run going into the race,” Deamer said. “He pinged the lids and Jason gave him a super ride. He just wasn’t good enough on the day.”</p>
