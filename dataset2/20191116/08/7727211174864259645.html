      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T08:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/charlotte-hadfield/" target="_blank">Charlotte Hadfield</a></address>
      <p>Christmas is one of the most exciting times of the year for children as they wake up in the early hours and rush downstairs to see what Santa has brought them.</p>
      <p>These days, children often ask for electronics on their <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> list, from Iphones to Xbox's.</p>
      <p>But back before the days of high tech equipment, many people hoped to wake up on <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> morning to a Mr Frosty machine, Polly Pockets and Walkie Talkies in their stocking.</p>
      <p>We asked our readers on social media to take a trip down memory lane and think back to what presents they once upon a time asked for on their <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas list growing up.</a></p>
      <p>And the responses came flooding in.</p>

      <h3>20. Mr Frosty</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>If you were lucky enough to own a Mr Frosty maker, you could make your very own frozen treats.</p>
      <p>The smiley snow man came with mixing dishes, an ice cube tray and ice lolly moulds.</p>
      <p>A lot of <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">ECHO</a> readers recalled asking for a Mr Frosty on their Christmas list, but few were lucky enough to get one.</p>
      <p>Hayley Jones, said: "I always wanted Mr Frosty and never got it. My mum said it was too cold for our bellies."</p>
      <p>Richard Hughes, added: "Any kid born in the early to mid eighties wanted a Mr Frosty, I don't know anyone that actually got one!!!"</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">ECHO</a> reader Donna Healey, said: "Me and my older brother wanted a Mr Frosty but never got one. Our younger brother who is ten years younger got one and it made him ill all Christmas we won't let him forget it."</p>
      <p>Similarly, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">ECHO</a> reader, Rachael Makin, said: "It makes me feel so much better that I wasn't the only deprived child with no Mr Frosty."</p>
      <h3>19. A Cabbage Patch Kid</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Cabbage Patch Kid's came complete with adoption papers from Babyland General Hospital and a unique name and birthday.</p>
      <p>For those who missed out on getting a Cabbage Patch Kid for Christmas as a kid your dreams are not quite dashed as you can still purchase one from Smyths Toys for £29.99.</p>
      <p>She said: "A cabbage patch kid! So when I had children I bought them both one!"</p>
      <p>Cathy Parlane, said: "I always wanted a cabbage patch doll."</p>
      <h3>18. Mousetrap game</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Mousetrap is a Christmas classic which everyone wanted back in the day.</p>
      <p>Players took turns to role the dice, before moving around the board and collecting cheese wedges along the way.</p>
      <p>With the aim of the game being to trap mice in the mousetrap, while avoiding getting trapped yourself.</p>
      <p>But for those who weren't fortunate enough to get Mousetrap for Christmas as a child, you can still buy an updated version of the game today.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">ECHO</a> reader, Christine Troilett, said: "I would have loved the game Mousetrap but I have not been left traumatised. Santa was always generous at our house."</p>
      <h3>17. Polly Pockets</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Polly Pockets were an iconic toy which were popular throughout the 90s.</p>
      <p>If you were lucky enough to own your own collection of Polly Pockets you'll recall the cute shell and heart compacts that transformed into a living space for the tiny dolls.</p>
      <p>You could spend hours dressing Polly Pockets in different outfits and taking them on trips in a stretch limousine.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">ECHO </a>reader, Megan McArdle, said: "I always wanted the Polly Pocket house with all the accessories but never got it."</p>
      <p>Similarly, Joanne Clare, said: "Mine was Polly Pockets...I’m sure I still have these in the loft too."</p>
      <h3>16. An Etch a Sketch</h3>

        <figcaption>Etch-a-Sketch<cite>(Image: Handout)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Many of us will recall asking for an Etch a Sketch on our Christmas list's back in the day.</p>
      <p>A traditional Etch a Sketch was red in colour and came equipped with a pen and two white wheels on each side, which you turned to create your drawing.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">ECHO</a> reader, Diane Lindfield, said: "I always wanted an Etch a Sketch but I didn’t get one. But actually, I was more than happy with my colouring book and felt tips, new slippers and a nightdress."</p>
      <h3>15. A Bionic Woman styling head</h3>
      <p>If you wanted to practice braiding and putting hair up in different styles - the Bionic Woman styling head was the go to present choice for many like <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">ECHO</a> reader, Jane Bridge, who said she was lucked enough to get one.</p>
      <h3>14. Tamagotchi</h3>

        <figcaption>If you grew up in the 90s you will recall everyone had a Tamagotchi at school<cite>(Image: Birmingham Post and Mail)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Keeping your Tamagotchi alive each day was a serious task for children throughout the 90s, who put them at the top of their Christmas list.</p>
      <p>The small hand-held devices required users to feed and nurture their pet creature to ensure it didn’t ‘die.’</p>
      <h3>13. A Furby</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>If you grew up in the 90s a Furby probably made an appearance on your Christmas list at one time or another.</p>
      <p>The owl like toys would drive parents made as they spoke and picked up phrases you said to them each day.</p>
      <p>One ECHO reader said: "I remember my dad having to put my Furby under the stairs with a towel over it's head just to shut it up!"</p>
      <h3>12. A La Carte kitchen</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Topsby Turvy Doll's came in a number of different designs and were a great present to ask for, for Christmas back in the day.</p>
      <p>From dolls with vibrant dresses to little red riding hood and Cinderella, you turned a Topsy Turvy Doll inside out to turn her into a different doll all together.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">ECHO</a> reader Christine Troilett said: "My best was my topsy turvy doll."</p>
      <h3>10. Subbuteo football set</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>The first Subbuteo football set's came out in the 1940's and gradually gained popularity among children.</p>
      <p>The football game came with playing figures on weighted based which were positioned across the tabletop pitch and a number of different team kits and accessories to choose from.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">ECHO </a>reader, Stijn De Nysm, said: "The best was a Subbuteo football set. The one that never came: a brother to play Subbuteo with."</p>
      <h3>9. Cadbury’s Dairy Milk Miniatures Dispenser Machine.</h3>
      <p>The Cadbury’s Dairy Milk Miniatures Dispenser Machine is a classic which many of us will remember putting on our Christmas lists.</p>
      <p>Unlike a normal piggy bank, the dispenser gave you something in return when you put money inside - a small miniature bar of chocolate.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">ECHO</a> reader, Julie Gault, said: "A bubble gum machine and a dairy milk miniatures vending machine."</p>
      <h3>8. Sega Mega Drive</h3>

        <figcaption>The Sega Mega Drive was a popular console throughout the 90s<cite>(Image: Internet Unknown)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The Sega Mega Drive was originally released in Japan in 1988, before it came to the UK in 1990.</p>
      <p>Before the days of Xbox's, the Mega Drive was the console every child wanted in the 90's.</p>
      <p>From games like Sonic Hedge Hog to Jungle Strike, you could spend hours playing on the Mega Drive with your friends.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">ECHO</a> reader, Craig Dillon, said: "As a kid it was probably Sega Mega Drive, SNES I got and a motorbike that I never got.</p>
      <p>While Andy Green, said: "Mine was a Sega Mega drive with Sonic 2. I must have clocked that game at least 100 times."</p>
      <h3>7. Raleigh chopper Bike</h3>
      <p>Raleigh Chopper bikes were a children's bicycle made by the Raleigh Bicycle Company and released in 1970s.</p>
      <p>The main features of the Chopper which made them unique, included a padded backed seat and high handlebars.</p>
      <p>The bikes were high on the Christmas lists of children of that generation, with many ECHO readers recalling putting them on their Christmas list.</p>
      <p>Lorraine Raftery, said: "I had a school desk which I sat at all Christmas day and loved it - that was 50 years ago but I never got a chopper cycle. x"</p>
      <p>While Lisa Jane Garland, said: "I wanted a Chopper but I got a Grifter instead so I can’t complain. I'm just still going on about it 40 years later!"</p>
      <h3>6. Sindy Doll</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article17263010.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Sindy-dolls-1982.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>A Sindy doll with a horse 1982<cite>(Image: Mirrorpix)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Sindy Doll's were a rival to Barbie's when they came out in 1963 and became the best selling toy in the UK in 1968 and 1970.</p>
      <p>The popularity of Sindy Doll's which you could dress up in different outfits, continued until the 90's when Barbie became a favourite among children.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">ECHO</a> reader, Maureen Mainwaring, said: "My daughter wanted the Sindy doll. I got it for her and her brother threw it off the 14th floor, I was fuming but I couldn't help but laugh."</p>
      <h3>5. Tressy Doll</h3>
      <p>Another doll which became popular among children throughout the 70's was the Tressy Doll.</p>
      <p>Unlike her rival Barbie, the Tressy doll came with the added bonus that her hair grew.</p>
      <p>After a press of her belly button, you could pull her hair out the top of her head to make it longer or shorter as you desired.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">ECHO</a> reader, Susan Peacock, said: "I always wanted a Tressie Doll because the hair would grow but I never got one."</p>
      <p>Similarly, Yvonne Owens, said: "A Tressy doll with hair that grows but I wanted a brunette Tressy and I got Blonde Tressy!</p>
      <p>"I was devastated at 9 years old. This was an important detail, so when the shops opened I bought a brunette colour shampoo and dunked her head in it for 30 minutes and ended up with a purple faced Tressy with strange lilac hair."</p>
      <h3>4. Johnny 7 toy gun</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>The Johnny 7 toy gun got its name from the seven different functions it came with.</p>
      <p>It became the best selling toy for boys' in 1964 and was something which ECHO readers recalled asking for but sadly never getting for Christmas.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">ECHO</a> reader, Frank Thomas, said: "The toy I wanted that Santa never brought was the Johnny 7 Gun.</p>
      <p>"I pestered my Dad for weeks. I used to see it in a shop window on Smithdown Road.</p>
      <p>"I went to get it a couple of weeks before Christmas and got there just in time to see it being removed from the window, sold! </p>
      <p>"He took no notice of the note in the window: "a small deposit secures any item".</p>
      <h3>3. A Fisher Price record player</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>The Fisher Price record player was a classic which has been around since the 1970's.</p>
      <p>But for those who didn't get one on their Christmas list as a kid, you can now buy an updated version of the record player from a number of different retailers.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">ECHO</a> reader, Helen Smith, said: "The one that I wished for and never got was a Fisher Price record player, I was obsessed with them."</p>
      <h3>2. Corgi Aston Martin DB6 James Bond toy car</h3>

        <img src="https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article17263328.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_James-Bond-007-Aston-Martin-DB6-car.jpg"/>

      <p>Those who grew up in the late 70's and 80's will recall the Corgi Aston Martin DB6 James Bond toy car, which came with an ejector seat.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">ECHO</a> reader, Frank Thomas, said: "The best was the James Bond DB6 Aston Martin with the ejector seat and all the bells and whistles.</p>
      <h3>1. Walkie Talkies</h3>
      <p>Long before the days of smart phones, walkie talkies were a fun way to communicate in secret with your friends and siblings.</p>
      <figure>
