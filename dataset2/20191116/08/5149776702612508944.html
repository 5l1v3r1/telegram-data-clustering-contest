      <h1>'Support the guy' - What Nottingham Forest fans have had to say on Aro Muric</h1>
      <h2>Nottingham Forest latest | The Manchester City loanee has seen Brice Samba replace him as first-choice goalkeeper following the opening month of the Championship season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T08:44:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 08:44</time> by <a rel="author">Josh Murray</a></address>
      <p>Nottingham Forest goalkeeper Aro Muric came close to helping Kosovo closer to an unlikely European Championship finals place last night.</p>
      <p>Kosovo suffered a dramatic 2-1 defeat to the Czech Republic in group A - the same group as England - in a result that secured the Czechs' qualification for Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/aro-muric">Muric's</a> Kosovo had threatened to cause an upset when a goal from Sheffield Wednesday Atdhe Nuhiu headed them in front just after half-time.</p>
      <p>At that stage, the visitors were set to boast a two-point lead over the Czech Republic with one fixture to go.</p>

      <p>The lead lasted until the final 20 minutes, as the Forest goalkeeper and his outfield teammates kept the home nation at bay.</p>
      <p>Their resilience was eventually broken by Alex Kral's stunning equalising strike, before Ondrej Celustka turned the result on its head by finding the net in the 79th minute.</p>
      <p>Despite the defeat, Muric was named Kosovo's man of the match ahead of their meeting with England on Sunday - and <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Forest</a> fans have been reacting to that news.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old is on a season-long loan at the City Ground from Manchester City, but despite starting the first four Championship matches of 2019-20, he has been overtaken in the starting XI by the in-form <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/brice-samba">Brice Samba</a> and has not featured since the Carabao Cup defeat to Arsenal in September.</p>

      <p><b>John CB:</b> Some of the tweets on here are laughable. Why not support the young man instead of slating the guy? God forbid Samba gets injured, Muric steps in and does a job?</p>
      <p><b>@JoeMF7:</b> He's had a bad start for us and Samba has been class, but Man City don't sign too many duds so let's support the guy. We might actually need him if Brice got injured so have a brain and think ahead.</p>
      <p><b>@Paramore1979:</b> Well played, Aro!</p>
      <p><b>redandgreen2:</b> Well done Aro!</p>
      <p><b>@kiieran_:</b> never thought i’d see that</p>
      <p><b>Lloyd:</b> But would never do that for us</p>
