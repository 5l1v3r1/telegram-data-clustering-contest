      <h1>McDonald's changing breakfast hours from next week</h1>
      <h2>Good news for fans of McMuffins</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T08:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Rachel Pugh</a></address>
      <p>Those of us who enjoy grabbing breakfast at McDonald's will now have an extra half an hour to cram in those McMuffins.</p>
      <p>New changes to breakfast hours are being introduced across the whole of the UK next week.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year McDonald's ran a series of trials in selected restaurants, which saw breakfast serving hours extended from 10.30am to 11am, <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink-news/mcdonalds-extending-breakfast-hours-uk-17260972">Manchester Evening News reports</a>.</p>
      <p>The trials were deemed a success and now the fast food giant has decided to roll-out the new hours across the UK.</p>
      <p>Michelle Graham-Clare, McDonald’s UK vice president food &amp; marketing, said: "We all understand the pain of missing out on a McMuffin by a matter of minutes.</p>
      <p>"We have listened to our customers’ pleas and are delighted to extend breakfast serving time until 11am, particularly as we head into the festive season when we see a rush of latecomers searching for those all-important hash browns."</p>
      <p>The new breakfast cut-off time of 11am will come into effect on Wednesday (November 20).</p>
