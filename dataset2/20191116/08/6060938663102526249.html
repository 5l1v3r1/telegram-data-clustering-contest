      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Shama-Sikander">Shama Sikander</a> perfectly knows how to turn up the heat on the internet, case in point being her latest monochrome click. The actress showed off her envious figure as she posed on a chair in an unbuttoned shirt. Adding a hat to her sultry avatar, Shama looked all things glamorous. Shama was recently seen in ‘Bypass Road’ and was happy with the film’s response. “I am overwhelmed and happy with the love that is coming my way post '<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Bypass-Road">Bypass Road</a>'. The audience and my fans have loved my performance and the portrayal of a strong character. Personally I met few fans at the screening and they praised the character. The people who matter in my life have loved my performance,” Shama told ETimes.</p>
