        <b>Sri Lankans trickled into polling centers early on Saturday to choose a new president for the island-nation still struggling to recover from Easter Sunday attacks on hotels and churches that have heavily weighed on its tourism-dependent economy.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Former defense secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who oversaw the military defeat of Tamil separatists 10 years ago, and government minister Sajith Premadasa are locked in a close fight, politicians and analysts say.</p>

      <p>Rajapaksa has vowed to overhaul national security, playing on the fears of the majority Sinhalese Buddhists following the April attacks claimed by Islamic State that killed more than 250 people.</p>
      <p>Premadasa has sought to fire up the countryside with promises of free housing, school uniforms for students and sanitary pads for women - touching on a topic rarely discussed in public anywhere in south Asia but which has drawn women to his rallies.</p>
      <p>Police said a group of unidentified men opened fire on buses carrying Muslims to a polling station in Anuradhapura district in central Sri Lanka. There were no injuries but witnesses said there were tires burning.</p>
      <p>At a polling station in Colombo, M Gunasekera, a 41-year-old homemaker, said the most important problem was widespread corruption and the lack of accountability of politicians.</p>

      <p>About 16 million people are eligible to vote, with the ballot allowing voters to choose up to three candidates in order of preference.</p>
      <p>Votes will be counted soon after polling stations close but the results are not expected before Sunday.</p>
      <p>Muslims who make up nearly 10 percent of Sri Lankaâ€™s 22 million population, say they have faced hostility ever since the April attacks.</p>
      <p>That division has come on top of long-standing grievances of ethnic Tamils, who say they are still to get justice stemming from the human rights violations during a 26-war civil war with Tamil rebels that ended in 2009.</p>
