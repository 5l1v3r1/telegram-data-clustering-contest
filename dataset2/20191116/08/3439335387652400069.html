      <p>Hulu is again raising prices for its online TV bundle, as other streaming-TV providers do the same.</p>
      <p>Hulu’s service, like AT&amp;T TV Now, Dish’s Sling and YouTube TV, are a replica of traditional TV but on the internet. They were once vaunted as a successor to traditional cable. But the market has lost steam as prices rise. One early entrant, Sony’s PlayStation Vue, is shutting down, and analysts expect others to follow.</p>
      <p>The entertainment industry’s attention has shifted to new and upcoming streaming services like Apple TV Plus, Disney Plus, AT&amp;T’s HBO Max and Comcast ‘s Peacock.</p>
      <p>Hulu with Live TV’s price will rise $10, to $55 a month, in December. Prices had risen $5 in February.</p>
      <p>The Disney-owned streaming provider’s traditional video-on-demand service will remain at $6 a month.</p>
