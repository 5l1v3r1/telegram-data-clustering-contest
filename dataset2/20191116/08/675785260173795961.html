      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T08:56:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 08:56</time> by <a rel="author">Emmeline Saunders</a></address>
      <p>We're now just <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/breaking-im-celebrity-start-date-20756848">a single day</a> away from this year's series of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! and ITV bosses have been hard at work behind the scenes roping in the biggest and best stars.</p>
      <p>And with the phenomenal success of last year's show - hosted temporarily by Holly Willoughby (who was standing in for Ant McPartlin) and Dec Donnelly - the 2019 series is set to be better than ever <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/ant-mcpartlin-confirmed-im-celebrity-14124866">with the jungle reunion of Ant and Dec</a>.</p>
      <p>From the looks of things, the line-up will be a cracker.</p>
      <p>The stars have all landed in Australia, having jetted in from all over the world.</p>
      <p>This year's line-up is even rumoured to include the highest-paid star ever, with them said to be commanding a fee of £500,000.</p>
      <p>Here's a look at the full line-up ahead of Sunday's launch.</p>
      <h3>I'm A Celebrity 2019: Confirmed contestants</h3>
      <h4>Ian Wright</h4>

      </figure>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Ian was the first star to jet into Australia for this year's show.</p>
      <p>The former footballer star turned pundit is already the bookies' favourite to win, with Ladbrokes offering odds of 5-2 that he'll be crowned King of the Jungle.</p>
      <p>And he's laughed off reigning King Harry Redknapp's comments that his temper could get him in trouble.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Told of Harry’s comments after touching down in Brisbane, he said: "Was Harry doing one of those tours where he’s talking? He’s got to fill it up hasn’t he?</p>
      <p>"The thing is, we play golf but I didn’t lose my rag.</p>
      <p>"What’s he on about talking about losing my rag? I don’t lose my rag anymore.</p>
      <p>"I’m much older and wiser. To be honest, nothing gets me angry anymore. I’ve been looking forward to this for so long."</p>
      <h4>Caitlyn Jenner</h4>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Caitlyn Jenner has touched down in Australia, amid reports she's commanding the biggest fee in the show's history - a whopping £500,000.</p>
      <p>The Keeping Up With The Kardashian star, 70, was the second contestant to land in Brisbane Airport for this year's jungle show.</p>
      <p>Asked if she was excited to be taking part in the show, Caitlyn said: “Yeah.”</p>
      <p>But she declined to answer further questions about whether any members of her family would be joining her or if she wanted to win and then got into a waiting car.</p>
      <p>Last Sunday, reports said Caitlyn won't be talking about anything her gender reassignment in camp.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Caitlyn - formerly Olympic gold medallist Bruce Jenner - had gender reassignment surgery in 2017, two years after announcing she was transgender.</p>
      <p>But she says: "It is not something I talk about. Yes, I had gender confirmation and that for me was important.</p>
      <p>"For many trans people it is not important to them. But for me it was.</p>
      <p>"Femininity and womanhood is in your brain and in your soul. That is the issue.</p>
      <p>"It is not what is between your legs. So yes, I had it done. But that is all out of respect to me, my privacy but also respect to the community. It is really not something you talk about."</p>
      <h4>Andrew Maxwell</h4>

      <p>After landing he told photographers he wouldn’t take his sunglasses off as “no one will know who I am anyway”.</p>
      <p>Asked about what he was scared of he said: “Snakes but I am going to fight them.</p>
      <p>"We don’t have snakes in Ireland and you should never trust an animal without shoulders who can’t shrug.”</p>
      <h4>Jacqueline Jossa</h4>

      <p>The 27-year-old star touched down at Brisbane Airport on Monday having flown in from the UK via Abu Dhabi.</p>
      <p>Asked about I'm A Celebrity, Jacqueline was coy and said: "I'm here on holiday, a girls' trip.</p>

        <figcaption>James Haskell arrives</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>He played down being on the show, saying: "I don't know what you are talking about, me and my mate here are just going to the gym."</p>
      <p>Told he might be entering an extreme situation in the jungle he added: "I am a professional rugby player for 16 years so you don't get more extreme than that do you?"</p>
      <p>Asked about the small rations in camp compared to what he normally eats as a fitness ambassador, he said: "I will cross that bridge when I come to it."</p>
      <p>Haskell was also asked if he had taken any advice from his famous family.</p>
      <p>He said: "Yeah my wife said make sure I sleep on the plane and stay hydrated and I wil' be alright."</p>

      <p>Myles landed in Australia last night ahead of his I'm A Celeb stint.</p>
      <p>But despite it being well-documented that he was heading into the jungle, the Rak-Su singer pretended he was in Oz to record music when quizzed about the show.</p>
      <p>Myles, 28, says he's planning to embrace single life following his split from Love Island's <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/gabby-allen-celebrity-big-brother-10781186">Gabby Allen</a>.</p>

      <p>He said: "I am single. I have just got out of a relationship but I think I want to be single for a bit and embrace single life!"</p>
      <p>In August, Gabby confirmed hr split from Myles after reports she'd caught him sexting other women.</p>

      <p>Kate was the eight celeb to land in Australia.</p>
      <p>The Good Morning Britain presenter, 52, is terrified of spiders, heights, being in a box covered with snakes - so basically everything she'll encounter Down Under.</p>
      <p>She said: "I am terrified of all of the things in the Jungle, especially heights – it is the crazy heights on thin bits suspended on bits of metal or wood. Or if you are in a little box with creepy crawlies or snakes in it!</p>

      <p>"But I am excited about doing the show because as you get older, you realise you don’t get many chances for pure adventure in life. I am going to give it a good shot and everyone can have a laugh and I hope it takes their mind off <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a>!"</p>

      <p>Girls Aloud star Nadine Coyle was the ninth star to arrive Down Under.</p>
      <p>Nadine told the Mirror: "I am so really looking forward to this huge challenge."</p>
      <p>Asked about her dramatic ITV promo video for the show where she had said she feared she could die on I'm A Celebrity, Nadine said: "That is absolutely the truth, it happens all the time, not in jungles but it is dangerous.</p>
      <p>"I am not a huge fan of rats and things like that."</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20865022.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_EH_CHP_121119Nadine-Coyle_2209JPG.jpg"/>

      <p>Ahead of the launch, she said: "I really want to try something completely new. I am scared of so many things. I used to be brave. In the past, I've opened a restaurant, had a record label, had my daughter and it was go, go, go with all of these.</p>
      <p>"Now I have got so fearful even being in the car, flying or general things. I think it is since I became a parent that I am much more afraid."</p>
      <h4>Roman Kemp</h4>

      <h4> </h4>
      <p>Capital FM DJ Roman is yet to land in Australia, but he's already tried on his jungle gear.</p>
      <p>He said: "I am not scared of the eating trials because I grew up with Dad’s cooking! I think the eating ones I will hate but I will do them. The show is iconic and you want to do everything."</p>
      <p>His Dad is, of course, Martin Kemp. Roman’s mum is Shirlie Kemp. So what do they think of their son taking part in I’m a Celebrity?</p>
      <p>"My Dad loves it," replies Roman. "He is ready to find the worst freeze frame possible of my face and put it out on social media! Mum will say she hates it up until the day I get in there. Once she sees the show, understands it and grasps I am in there, I think she will be alright. She is really nervous though!"</p>
      <h4>The other rumoured star...</h4>
      <h4>Andrew Whyment</h4>

      </figure>
      <p>Every year, bosses throw in a late arrival to shake things up - and rumours claim Andrew is 2019's bombshell star.</p>
      <p>The 38 year-old actor is a Corrie veteran, having starred as Kirk Sutherland for nearly 20 years.</p>
      <p>According to reports, he's the most recent jungle signing and the 11th celeb from the Cobbles to join, following in the footsteps of the likes of Helen Flanagan, Nigel Havers and Sair Khan.</p>
      <p>A source told The Sun that producers "were chuffed to get Andrew as viewers have watched him on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/coronation-street">Coronation Street</a> for the best part of two decades, yet know nothing about him away from Kirk".</p>
      <p>It's not his first taste of reality telly - he donned his skates in 2012's Dancing On Ice.</p>
