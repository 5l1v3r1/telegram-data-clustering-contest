      <p>A <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/greggs">Greggs</a> customer has hit out at a staff member over his 'banter' about how much she visits.</p>
      <p>Kathy Readon says she was told by an employee "you're in here every day, you're going to get sick of this eventually" as she bought a pizza at the branch in Alton, Hants.</p>
      <p>However the 21-year-old failed to see the funny side and responded that she couldn't afford to eat there every day - but claims the man continued his joke during the incident on Wednesday, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/greggs-customer-hits-out-staff-20887537">Mirror.co.uk reports.</a></p>
      <p>Kathy took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> to demand an explanation from the snack giant as to why she had received an apparent 'dressing down' for being a regular.</p>
      <p>Following her complaint, Kathy says Greggs issued her an apology, a £6.00 voucher and said that 'things are going to be done' as the staff member's conduct had been flagged to the area manager.</p>
      <p>She says that due to anxiety, the staff member's joke was like her "worst fears all happening all at once".</p>

      <p>Kathy, from Guildford, said: "Literally all that happened was I went in - I am a regular there, I work down the road and have been doing so for a year.</p>
      <p>"I'm very anxious, I don't really talk to people. But I went in, I ordered what I normally order and I think he was trying to be banterous with me but it did not come off that way.</p>
      <p>"He essentially just made fun of me for ordering pizza and it kind of felt like he was making fun of unhealthy habits.</p>
      <p>"It came across like he was picking on me. There were other people in the store and he kept saying that I was in there every single day.</p>

      <p>"I wish I had the income that would allow me to be at Greggs every single day but I don't.</p>
      <p>"When I said this he argued with me about it. During the interaction I also told him he was making me feel very anxious and he ignored it.</p>
      <p>"He carried on speaking to me in the same manner, saying the same things.</p>
      <p>"He said 'you're in here every day, you're going to get sick of this eventually' - talking about the pizza.</p>
      <p>"I have lots of mental health things so I fear public interaction on a daily basis. I'm always worried that something like that is going to happen. I invent it in my head.</p>
      <p>"But then it did happen in real life and it was like my worst fears all happening all at once."</p>
      <p>Kathy, an officer worker in Alton, said Greggs issued her an apology and a £6.00 voucher and said that 'things are going to be done'.</p>
      <p>She said: "Greggs have said they're very sorry and that this is not the behaviour they expect.</p>
      <p>"They said that they're going to let their area manager know and things are going to be done and apparently I will notice improvements, which is nice. To be honest, I'm quite happy with Greggs response."</p>
      <p>Mirror Online has contacted Greggs for comment.</p>
