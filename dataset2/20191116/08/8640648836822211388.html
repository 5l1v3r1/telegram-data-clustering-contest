      <p>Martin Blake threw a 17-yard touchdown pass to Donte McJoy after a botched field-goal attempt to lift Canyon Springs to a 24-20 victory over host Arbor View in a Class 4A Mountain Region quarterfinal game on Friday.</p>
      <p>The Pioneers won their fourth straight to advance to a rematch with Desert Pines. The Jaguars won the first meeting 49-14, part of an 0-6 start to the season for Canyon Springs.</p>
      <p>The game was a back-and-forth affair between the two schools with Daniel Mitchell and D’Andre Washington scoring rushing touchdowns for the Aggies. The latter gave Arbor View a 17-9 halftime lead.</p>

      <p>Easton Jones’ 42-yard field goal gave Arbor View a 20-17 with six minutes left in the game.</p>
      <p>Canyon Springs attempted a game-tying field goal of its own a few minutes later, but came up with something even better when the holder Blake had to scramble and throw for the score. The Pioneers’ defense then held the Aggies to preserve the win.</p>
      <p>Liberty 52, Foothill 21 — At Liberty, Daniel Britt threw for three touchdowns and ran for another score as the Patriots beat the Falcons for the second time this season.</p>
      <p>Trey Cain returned an interception 25 yards, while Zephania Maea and Edwards Gastelum had rushing scores for the Patriots (7-5), who beat Foothill 38-0 on Oct. 18.</p>
