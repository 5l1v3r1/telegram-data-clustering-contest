      <p><i>"Every weekend is important,"</i> Hulkenberg said to <a href="https://twitter.com/AlbertFabrega/status/1195041939609018369"><i>Albert Fabrega</i></a> when asked about how he will approach the rest of the season. <i>"I want to leave the team in the best way. Next year I will not be on the grid. I will not retire as a driver. But for now it will be a year without running. I don't know what will happen in the future I'm not in a hurry. I don't see myself as a test driver."</i></p>

      <p>Hulkenberg is a quality driver and it is possible that he could have a year away from Formula 1 before being resigned to a team for 2021. The Renault driver sees himself as being above being a reserve driver and will hope that opportunities open up before too long. </p>
