        <b>Atletico Madrid are reportedly interested in signing Real Madrid forward Mariano Diaz.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 26-year-old has not made a single appearance for Los Blancos this season. So far, He made Zinedine Zidane’s matchday squad for just one match, against Real Mallorca. According to <a href="https://www.donbalon.com/futbol/laliga/florentino-llama-atletico-le-dice-ni-os-ocurra-hacerlo-es-mio">Don Balon</a>, Atletico Madrid are eager to sign Diaz as a backup option for Alvaro Morata. The report claims that Diego Simeone is an admirer of the forward but Florentino Perez doesn’t want him to join Los Colchoneros.</p>

      <p>Atletico Madrid need some more firepower upfront since Diego Costa hasn’t done very well this season. The 31-year-old has amassed just two goals and three assists in 15 appearances across all competitions this season so far.</p>
      <p>Diaz who is valued at €20 million according to <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.com/mariano-diaz/profil/spieler/225020">Transfermarkt</a>, might prefer a move away from the Santiago Bernabeu given his current situation. If the 26-year-old joins Atletico Madrid, then he may not be a regular but will at least get first-team opportunities.</p>
