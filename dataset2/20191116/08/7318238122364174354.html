      <h1>In Las Vegas, Elon Musk's tunneling company digs in</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T08:57:37+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 08:57</time> by <a rel="author">Dennis Romero </a></address>
      <p>Billionaire Elon Musk's dream of using tunnels as re-imagined people movers kicked off in the real world Friday, as his Boring Company held a ceremony in Las Vegas celebrating the start of drilling for its first commercial project to get underway.</p>
      <p>The $53 million twin-tunnel "Loop" system is expected to take visitors to three stops spread across the length of less than a mile, 40 feet below the sprawling and expanding Las Vegas Convention Center.</p>
      <p>Convention officials said in a statement that digging started in earnest — several test tunnels were already developed — Friday.</p>
      <p>"This is the first commercial endeavor" for the Boring Company, they said.</p>
      <p>Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority CEO Steve Hill said getting across the 200-acre convention center site, which has a new addition, its West Hall, under construction, would have otherwise taken as long as 45 minutes by foot and included crossing busy streets.</p>
      <p>"From one end of the campus to the other will be little less than two minutes" with the Boring Loop, he told <a href="https://news3lv.com/news/local/tunneling-to-start-for-vegas-convention-center-people-mover">NBC News affiliate KSNV</a>.</p>
      <p>Rides will be free, convention officials said.</p>
      <p>The Boring Company, based in Hawthorne, California, has proposed similar subterranean projects in Los Angeles, Chicago and between Washington and Baltimore, Maryland.</p>
      <p>A test tunnel that begins beneath Boring's property in Hawthorne was <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/tech/elon-musk-puts-his-electric-car-tunnel-calls-it-future-ncna949686">opened to reporters last year</a> but raised as many questions about the company's Loop system as it answered.</p>
      <p>Although it's meant as a high-speed alternative to freeway driving, each tunnel in the system would be limited to the passenger capacity of a Tesla vehicle, and its ability to safely and comfortably facilitate high-speed travel as advertised is <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/vintage-roller-coaster-fans-see-familiar-tech-elon-musk-s-n951311">not clear</a>.</p>
      <p>In Las Vegas it's not apparent if off-the-shelf rides from Musk's Tesla electric vehicle company or promised "high-occupancy" autonomous electric vehicles, yet to be unveiled, will be used. <a href="https://www.boringcompany.com/lvcc">Promised speeds</a> of up to 155 mph won't be happening, Hill told KNSV.</p>
      <p>Speeds would be limited to 35 mph, he told the station, because the short length of the system wouldn't safely allow anything faster.</p>
      <p>Boring has also promised that its projects would be <a href="https://www.boringcompany.com/faq/">privately funded</a>, but the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority got its start with a green light from the state Legislature, which provided it with a stream of <a href="https://www.lvcva.com/who-we-are/mission-and-purpose/">hotel tax dollars</a>.</p>
      <p>Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority officials said the system was scheduled to be open by January 2021.</p>
