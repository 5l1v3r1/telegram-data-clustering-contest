      <h1>Denise Richards Narrowly Avoids Major Wardrobe Malfunction In Super Short Dress At Bravo Con</h1>

      <h4>Denise’s super sexy orange blazer mini didn’t leave much to the imagination as she strutted down a hotel hallway!</h4>
      <p>There’s no question that <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/celeb/denise-richards/"><b>Denise Richards</b></a>, 48, is in incredible shape! The <i>Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</i> star posted a boomerang video of herself wearing an insanely sexy orange blazer mini dress to Instagram on Nov. 16 — but nearly had a wardrobe malfunction as she showed off her outfit! The dress, by celeb go-to Retrofete, featured a low cut up top and v-shaped slit at the bottom, nearly giving followers a NSFW peek up her dress. Denise is currently in NYC for Bravocon and glammed up for an appearance at the evenings’ panel alongside other ladies from the show.</p>
      <p>“Fun great night!!, Denise captioned the spicy video, adding a re-post from her stylist. “@laurarugetti ・・・How 🔥 is @deniserichards !!!! MUA @glambypamelab ✨ Hair by 🙋‍♀️dress @retrofete.” Her hair and makeup was totally on point as she rocked a Malibu-inspired beach wave and perfectly golden tan, finishing the look with a sexy strappy sandal with on-trend clear details. The ’70s-inspired dress fit Denise perfectly, accenting her toned tummy and showing off her gorgeously shaped legs. The actress snapped a series of photos from the evening alongside her equally gorgeous co-stars <b>Lisa Rinna</b>, <b>Dorit Kemsley</b>, <b>Erika Girardi</b>, and <b>Kyle Richards </b>and looked absolutely stunning!</p>
      <p>Denise surprisingly joined <i>RHOBH </i>in 2018, but was an immediate hit on the show for her candor when it comes to sex, love and relationships. “Sometimes I’m a little too open [about my sex life],” Denise — who is married to <b>Aaron Phypers</b>, 47 — <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/11/15/denise-richards-aaron-phypers-sex-life-interview/">admitted to <b>HollywoodLife </b>EXCLUSIVELY</a> at BravoCon.</p>

      <p>In addition to appearing on the popular reality series, Denise also joined <i>The Bold and the Beautiful</i> as a full-time cast member, playing troublemaker Shauna Fulton and continues to act in various projects. In addition to acting on the soap, Denise also appeared in <i>BH90210 </i>over the summer and has a slew of other projects in the works including sci-fi series <i>FraXtur</i>, <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/10/13/denise-richards-new-movie-savannah-may-talks-playing-daughter-interview/">TV movie <i>The Secret Lives of Cheerleaders</i></a> and Christmas-themed project <i>My Adventures with Santa</i>. She confirmed to <b>HollywoodLife </b>EXCLUSIVELY that <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/10/26/denise-richards-not-shooting-rhobh-less-due-to-acting-career-interview/">she won’t be filming <i>RHOBH </i>less</a> due balancing her busy acting career, making her one busy lady!</p>
