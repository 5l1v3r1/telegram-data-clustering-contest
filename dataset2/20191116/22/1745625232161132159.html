      <p>Jessica Nigri revealed that she just recently got into the world of 'The Witcher.'</p>
      <p>Jessica Nigri teamed up with another popular <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/cosplay/">cosplay</a> model, Meg Turney, to channel two of the female characters from <i>The Witcher</i> fantasy franchise, and her Instagram followers found their collaboration absolutely enchanting.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, Jessica Nigri, who has become known as the “Queen of Cosplay,” took to Instagram to share two snapshots of herself and Meg Turney rocking costumes based on women from<i> The Witcher</i> world. Jessica is dressed up like “child of destiny” Ciri, the white-haired princess whose full name is a mouthful: Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon. Ciri is the adopted daughter of Geralt of Rivia, the main character in <i>The Witcher</i> fantasy novels, video games, and upcoming Netflix series.</p>
      <p>Jessica’s Ciri costume included a thick white wig and a billowy white blouse, which she wore over a lacy bra. She pulled her shirt down to expose the undergarment, which showed off her ample bust. She also sported a brown underbust corset and matching fingerless gloves. In her first slideshow photo, she isn’t wearing pants; she has on a black thong and knitted thigh-high stockings instead. In the second snapshot, she’s rocking black leather leggings embellished with silver studs. She also has on a pair of over-the-knee brown boots and a silver belt.</p>

      <p>Meg Turney is dressed like Triss Merigold, a sorceress who is like an older sister to Ciri. In Jessica’s first photo, Meg is wearing a bright red wig that has been twisted into a low bun. She has on a teal bra and matching sheer underwear. Over her lingerie, Meg is wearing a vest-like garment with a white collar and sleeves that have been embellished with pearls and blue-and-white trim in a grid pattern. She also has on a pair of long fingerless gloves in a bright red shade that matches the thick belt around her waist. Like Jessica, Meg is more covered up in the second photo; a brown faux leather shirt, pants, and boots have been added to her costume.</p>
      <p>In response to Jessica Nigri’s photos, her Instagram followers expressed their excitement over seeing Meg Turney with her.</p>
      <p>“I always love the collabs between you two! So awesome!! Hype!” wrote one fan.</p>
      <p>“There is nothing greater in this world than Jess/Meg collabs. Glad you’re enjoying the game,” another remarked.</p>
