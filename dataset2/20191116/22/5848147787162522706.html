      <h1>Oh, the ecstasy when you and a dress just click – and no, I don’t mean online</h1>

      <p>I had lunch with a friend a couple of months ago, and she was wearing a gorgeous lipstick pink velvet blazer.</p>
      <p>“Where did you buy that?” I asked.</p>
      <p>“I found this great boutique just near me,” she replied.</p>
      <p>“You should go.”</p>
      <p>And so when I found myself in the Kings Cross neighbourhood last week, I popped in.</p>
      <p>And the clothes were lovely, all designed by the owner for her label Baz Inc, and made in Australia.</p>
      <p>They had everything going for them; beautifully designed, wearable styles that had just the right amount of edge to keep them interesting, such as a fluorescent striped ribbon sewn down the sleeve of a crisp voile floral peasant blouse, a bomber jacket for evening in low key lurex and silk satin skirts with sporty details at the waist.</p>

      <p>The prices were reasonable, the fit forgiving.</p>
      <p>As I was flicking through the racks, Baz said “this just came in today” and handed me a navy blue silk satin tea dress, cut on the bias, finishing just about the ankle.</p>
      <p>“Try it on,” she urged.</p>
      <p>I rushed to the change room, praying that it would fit.</p>
      <p>I pulled it over my head, and felt it glide easily over my hips.</p>
      <p>Short sleeves that covered the tops of my arms, a v neckline that was not too low.</p>
      <p>It tapered under the bust, making me look like I have a waist.</p>
      <p>And, wait for it, it had pockets.</p>
      <p>This was my absolute dream dress come to life.</p>
      <p>“Oh and I have this one” she said, offering me another one in the same style, but this time in black silk with a fine pink spot.</p>
      <p>I was feeling giddy with excitement.</p>
      <p>The perfect dress. Times two.</p>
      <p>“And how about this?” she said, pulling out a bright electric blue version in a slightly stretchier fabric.</p>
      <p>It looked just as fab as the other two, and it was a colour I would never normally consider.</p>
      <p>“I can’t buy three in the same style can I?” I asked Baz.</p>
      <p>“No, I think you can have two,” she said sensibly.</p>
      <p>But which ones?</p>
      <p>The navy silk was a no-brainer.</p>

      <p>It had a bit of a vintage Downton Abbey feel about it, and I could see it with a red lip and diamante jewellery.</p>
      <p>And what’s not to love about a classic spot?</p>
      <p>“I don’t know that I’m going to wake up every day thinking I want to wear electric blue,” I mused.</p>
      <p>“I can always make you one later on in black,” Baz said helpfully.</p>
      <p>I left with the navy and the spot, and it hit me as I strolled back to the car what a brilliant experience it is to shop locally, in a boutique where the owner/designer/dressmaker knows you, and understands your style.</p>
      <p>This has been the bonding experience of many generations of women, who have walked past a shop window and seen a pretty dress that they simply had to have, and that made them feel a million dollars.</p>
      <p>Online shopping may be convenient but isn’t it great to know who made your clothes?</p>
