      <h1>Calgary-area UCP MLAs say they won't support conscience rights bill</h1>

      <p>A controversial private member’s bill meant to extend protection for physicians’ conscience rights will not be supported by a pair of Calgary-area MLAs who’ve spoken out against the bill they say could do more harm than good.</p>
      <p>Introduced in the legislature by Peace River UCP backbencher Dan Williams last week, Bill 207 would prevent patients from submitting a professional complaint or suing a health care worker for failing to provide a service if medical staff objects to it. The bill would also add “conscientious beliefs” as grounds protected from discrimination in the Alberta Human Rights Act.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Postmedia Saturday, Airdrie-East UCP MLA Peter Guthrie and Minister of Justice and Solicitor General Doug Schweitzer said they both object to the bill, which its opponents have said could further restrict patients’ access to abortions, contraception, and medical aid in dying.</p>
      <p>“I do worry about access to health care and there’s some challenges that are going to come from this — interpretations that are going to be made,” said Guthrie. “I think we have freedom of conscience, freedom of religion already and I think that as far as our mandate to reduce red tape, this will increase red tape.</p>
      <p>“Because of the ambiguity around it, and the nature of the bill, it has more questions that arise from it than solutions. I don’t think that this is something that’s going to help Albertans.”</p>

      <p>In talks with his Calgary-Elbow constituents, Schweitzer said he heard from a vocal community that opposes the bill.</p>
      <p>“The last few weeks I’ve heard from my constituents, talking to them about different pieces of legislation that are before us in Edmonton and when it comes to Bill 207, my constituents have been clear to me that we simply cannot support this type of legislation right now in Alberta,” said Schweitzer. “In its current form, it just simply does not work.</p>
      <p>“It’s controversial, it has the perceived and real potential impact on health care services against Alberta. That’s not what I campaigned on locally.”</p>
      <p>On Friday, Premier Jason Kenney said he hasn’t read the four-page bill, nor has he contemplated its implications adding he wouldn’t say if he supported it or not.</p>
      <p>Kenney also said his government will “always have free votes” on bills introduced to the legislature by individual MLAs, as compared to government bills.</p>
      <p>On Monday, a <a href="https://www.assembly.ab.ca/committees/docs/PB-1747-agenda.pdf">legislative committee</a> will consider whether all MLAs should have an opportunity to debate <a href="https://www.assembly.ab.ca/net/index.aspx?p=bills_status&amp;selectbill=207&amp;legl=30&amp;session=1">Bill 207</a>, or kill the Conscience Rights (Health Care Providers) Protection Act.</p>
      <p>Calgary Nose Hill MP Michelle Rempel tweeted Saturday asking why the bill was needed at all.</p>
      <p>“Why is it needed at all? Have there been any cases where Alberta physicians have had their conscience rights violated? Doesn’t existing practice already cover this?” she tweeted.</p>
      <p>“Removing the requirement to make an effective referral is highly problematic — just referring someone to a website likely places the rights of marginalized Albertans at risk.”</p>
