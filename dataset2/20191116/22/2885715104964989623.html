      <p>Highlighting the perils of fake news, Vice-President M <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/venkaiah-naidu">Venkaiah Naidu</a> on Saturday urged the media to always maintain objectivity, fairness and accuracy.</p>
      <p>Speaking at an event organised by the Press Council of India to observe National Press Day and confer National Awards for Excellence in Journalism, Naidu said, “The cardinal principle of journalism is to present fair, objective, accurate and balanced information to the reader and viewer without journalists assuming the role of the gatekeepers. With the electronic and social media providing news by the minute with alerts and flashes on smartphones, journalists will have to exercise greater caution and guard against ‘fake news’, disinformation and misinformation.”</p>
      <p>Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting Prakash Javadekar, who also attended the event, said that fake news is a bigger crisis than paid news.</p>
