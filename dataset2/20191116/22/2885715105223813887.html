      <p>Anil Ambani has resigned as director of Reliance Communications (RCom), which is currently going through the insolvency process. The company, on Friday, announced a loss of Rs 30,142 crore for the September quarter of financial year 2019-20.</p>
      <p>According to a stock exchange filing, Ambani, along with Chhaya Virani, Ryna Karani, Manjari Kacker and Suresh Rangachar, has resigned as a director of RCom.</p>
      <p>“Your good office may also note that Manikantan V has also tendered his resignation as a Director and Chief Financial Officer of the company earlier. The resignations shall be put up to the committee of creditors of the Company for their consideration,” the filing said.</p>
      <p>In May 2019, following a National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) directive, RCom informed the stock exchanges that the administration of the company would be taken over by the interim resolution professional (RP) and the corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) would resume. “The powers of the board of directors or the partners of the corporate debtor, as the case may be, shall stand suspended and be exercised by the interim resolution professional,” the company had said in the filing.</p>
      <p>On Friday, RCom posted a loss of Rs 30,142 crore for the September quarter of fiscal 2019-20 due to provisioning for liabilities after the Supreme Court ruling on statutory dues.</p>
      <p>The company had reported Rs 338 crore in losses for the June quarter (Q1), and a profit of Rs 1,295 crore in Q2 last year. It reported Rs 305 crore in revenue, down from Rs 866 crore in Q1.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel had reported a combined loss of Rs 74,000 crore for the September quarter.</p>
      <p>RCom has provided for estimated liability aggregating to Rs 25,588 crore up to September 30, 2019, of Rs 21,420 crore towards license fee (Rs 3,892 crore, Rs 4,967 crore and Rs 12,561 crore towards principal, penalty, and interest on principal and penalty respectively) and Rs 4,168 crore towards Spectrum Usage Charges (Rs 936 crore, Rs 355 crore and Rs 2,877 crore towards principal, penalty and interest on principal and penalty respectively) as exceptional items that may undergo revision based on demands from DoT and/or any developments in this matter, it said.</p>
