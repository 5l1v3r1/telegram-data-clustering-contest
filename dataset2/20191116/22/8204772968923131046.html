      </p>
      <p>Kilkenny are champions of the inaugural New York Hurling Classic after a convincing 24-point win over Limerick at Citi Field in Queens.</p>
      <p>The four-team, three-game tournament features a modified game of hurling called Super 11s – which is played on a soccer pitch by teams of 11 players and incorporates similar rules to hockey and basketball like penalty corners and shot clocks.</p>
      <p>Teams can only score goals in Super 11s and more points are awarded if a goal is scored from long range.</p>
      <p>Kilkenny demolished Tipperary with a ruthless 50-point drubbing earlier in the day, while Limerick eased to a 32-point win over Leinster champions Wexford in the first game of the afternoon.</p>
      <p>The Super 11s led to exciting, goal-crazy fare throughout the day and the 11,000-strong crowd was treated to an entertaining spectacle, particularly in the final.</p>
      <p>It was reigning champions Limerick who did all the early running in the showpiece event and they took the lead through Paddy O’Loughlin after just 80 seconds with a cool finish from inside the box.</p>
      <p>They found <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Eoin+Murphy">Eoin Murphy</a> in particularly resolute form in the Kilkenny goal thereafter, however, and failed to build on their dominance.</p>
      <p>The Glenmore club man made a string of superb saves to prevent the Treaty County from racing into a substantial lead inside the opening 10 minutes and Limerick were punished for their wastefulness by a ruthless Kilkenny attack.</p>
      <p>First, Ger Aylward latched onto a diagonal ball and rifled home an equaliser before scores from <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Liam+Blanchfield">Liam Blanchfield</a> and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Michael+Cody">Michael Cody</a> saw the Cats hit the front for the first time.</p>
      <p>Limerick briefly restored parity through quickfire scores from Pat and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Colin+Ryan">Colin Ryan</a>, but Kilkenny would begin to establish control on proceedings soon after.</p>
      <p>A low drive from <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Billy+Ryan">Billy Ryan</a> was followed by two penalties in quick succession from the unerring <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Alan+Murphy">Alan Murphy</a> and Kilkenny took a commanding 16-point lead with half-time approaching.</p>
      <p>A surging run from Gearoid Hegarty and a penalty from <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Pat+Ryan">Pat Ryan</a> brought Limerick back within a score, but Conor Fogarty’s brilliant strike from a corner on the stroke of half-time saw Kilkenny take a healthy 12-point lead at the break.</p>
      <p>Limerick showed signs of resistance after the interval, scoring twice through Colin Ryan and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Aaron+Costello">Aaron Costello</a> to reduce the arrears to just four points, but they would crucially not score again for a full 15 minutes and Kilkenny showed no remorse.</p>
      <p>The excellent Billy Ryan dispatched a penalty after 27 minutes to give Kilkenny breathing space once more, before Alan Murphy completed his hat-trick with yet another six-pointer.</p>
      <p>Pat Ryan emphatically converted a penalty to suggest that a fightback was on the cards but Kilkenny moved ruthlessly to snuff out any chance of a comeback.</p>
      <p>Billy Ryan tapped home an Alan Murphy rebound to complete his hat-trick and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Luke+Scanlon">Luke Scanlon</a> added another to give the Cats an 18-point buffer.</p>
      <p>Limerick lost Darragh O’Donovan to a red card for a reckless tackle on Eoin Murphy as the game continued to slip away from them.</p>
      <p>There was still time for the brilliant Alan Murphy to bury a penalty and for Ryan to add a final blow before Kilkenny were officially crowned champions for 2019.</p>
