      <p>Glee star Kevin McHale became the latest contestant to leave <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-x-factor/">The </a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-x-factor/">X Factor</a>: Celebrity tonight after a shocking sing-off with footballing legend Vinnie Jones – who offered to drop out of the competition.</p>
      <p>The two were pitted together after they both gave spirited performances during the show; with Kevin performing a cover of Donna Summer’s I Feel Love and Vinnie performing a medley of songs by The Clash.</p>
      <p>But it seemed that the American actor’s fate was sealed during the sing-off when X-men star Vinnie performed an Irish shanty acapella, seemingly in tribute to his late wife Tanya.</p>
      <p>There was one final twist as Vinnie pleaded with boss <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/simon-cowell/">Simon Cowell</a> to allow him to drop out of the competition, in favour of putting Kevin through to the semi-final.</p>
      <p>However, Simon didn’t seem ready to let his pal leave the show, and went against his wishes.</p>

      <p>Whilst Nichole Scherzinger and Louis Walsh both backed their own acts, it was down to Syco mogul Simon to decide their fate.</p>

      <p>‘The last person I want to fall out with is Vinnie Jones,’ he said, as the footballer looked on tearfully.</p>
      <p>‘But I think we’re about to because I’m going to ask you to stay in the competition.’</p>
      <p>It seemed uncertain for a while what was actually going to happen, but a clearly emotional Vinnie finally seemed to agree with Cowell.</p>
      <p>‘He’s the boss,’ he said simply to host Dermot O’Leary.</p>
      <p>And so, Kevin’s fate was sealed and he became the latest act to be eliminated from the competition in the most stressful sing-off yet.</p>

      <p>Have we all recovered from that yet? We’re only just about catching our breath.</p>
      <p>It was a true night of controversy too, as<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/the-x-factor-celebrity-safe-seats-scrapped-live-on-air-as-simon-cowell-changes-rules-again-11168793/"> Simon Cowell once again changed the rules live on air</a> by scrapping the controversial safe-seats.</p>
      <p>With one per judge, an act chosen for a safe seat would go automatically into the next week’s live show, thereby skipping the all-important public vote.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>But it seems, after backlash from fans, the music mogul had a change of heart.</p>
      <p>When grilled by host Dermot O’Leary, Cowell said: ‘I actually do read social media, and they said they hated [the safe seats] so they’ve gone.’</p>
