      <h1>CBS Analyst Makes Bold Cardale Jones Comparison For Alabama</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T22:12:46+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 22:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>Alabama already needed some help to make the College Football Playoff, after last week’s loss to LSU. Today, with the injury to Tua Tagovailoa, that became a lot more difficult.</p>
      <p>Nick Saban kept Tagovailoa, who has been nursing an ankle injury, in the game against Mississippi State up 35-7 with about three minutes left in the first half. The legendary head coach wanted to get his starting quarterback some reps in the two-minute drill during a real game, and was going to pull him after that drive.</p>
      <p>On a throwing play, he went down hard, and had to be airlifted to a hospital in Birmingham. It is now being reported that Tagovailoa suffered a dislocated hip and posterior wall fracture, and is <a href="https://thespun.com/sec/alabama-crimson-tide/breaking-tua-tagovailoa-is-reportedly-out-for-the-season">out for the season</a>.</p>
      <p>That puts the onus on Mac Jones, who has looked solid when he’s played for Tua Tagovailoa this year. Winning out, which would include an Iron Bowl game against Auburn, will be very difficult.</p>
      <p>During today’s big Georgia at Auburn game, CBS analyst Gary Danielson stumped for Alabama’s College Football Playoff candidacy, even without Tua. He argued that if Mac Jones steps in and wins out, it should be treated like the 2014 Ohio State situation with Cardale Jones.</p>

      <p>Of course, there are some key differences here.</p>
      <p>Whether or not Alabama’s Jones can be as effective as Cardale, the opportunity to impress the selection committee as much as Ohio State did is probably not there. Cardale Jones stepped in during the Michigan game, and led Ohio State to a 59-0 win over No. 13 Wisconsin in the Big Ten Championship.</p>
      <p>Auburn may be a comparable opponent, but barring something shocking happening to LSU, Alabama won’t have the opportunity to play for a conference title. The Tigers have a tiebreaker over Alabama, and a very manageable schedule going forward.</p>
      <p>Without an LSU collapse, Alabama will need significant help, with a number of teams with the ability to control their own destiny better than the Crimson Tide at this point.</p>
      <p>Of course, Saban’s team has never missed a College Football Playoff, and has snuck in without an SEC title before. Convincing the committee that it is one of the best four teams without Tagovailoa will be a daunting task.</p>
