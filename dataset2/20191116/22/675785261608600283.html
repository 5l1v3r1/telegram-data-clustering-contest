      <h2>Lionel Messi was making his international comeback in Argentina's friendly with Brazil on Sunday, in which he scored. But he had a come-together with Tite</h2>

      <p>Thiago Silva has laid into Lionel Messi for his behaviour during Brazil's international friendly with Argentina.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> superstar Messi returned to international football on Saturday after his three-match ban for claiming that the Copa America was "fixed for Brazil" - with the hosts beating the Argentines in the semi-final, before going on to beat Peru in the final - had elapsed.</p>
      <p>Messi netted a 13th minute penalty to settle the friendly, which took place in Saudi Arabia, after Gabriel Jesus has fired his earlier spot kick wide.</p>
      <p>But Messi's most eye-catching moment of the encounter came when he put his finger to his lips and told Tite to "shut up" - following the Brazil manager's remonstrations in trying to get the forward booked.</p>

      <p>Tite was not impressed by Messi's gesture and words.</p>
      <p>"I complained because he [Messi] should have been shown a yellow card and he told me to shut my mouth and I told him to shut his mouth," he said.</p>
      <p>"I don't want to answer anymore on it. You need a strong referee because he'll swallow you... It should have been a card, I was right to complain. And that was it."</p>

      <p>But defender Silva was more scathing of Messi's conduct.</p>
      <p>The Paris Saint Germain centre back told reporters that Messi needed to get educated despite the rivalry between the two South American nations.</p>
      <p>"He wanted to run the game, wanted to blow the whistle. He gave two balls to the ball and the referee did nothing. He argued with the referee and the referee kept laughing. Admiration has to be set aside," Silva said.</p>
      <p>"It's hard, because we talk so much about education and one of the most admired guys in football say... I'm not going to tell an old man, because he'll be mad at me, but have a coach shut up. As much as you have rivalry, education must come first."</p>
