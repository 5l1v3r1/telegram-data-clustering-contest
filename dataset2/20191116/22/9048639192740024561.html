      <p>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) - The Latest on Louisiana election (all times local):</p>
      <p>9:15 p.m.</p>
      <p>Republican Kyle Ardoin has won his first full term as Louisiana’s chief elections official, the secretary of state.</p>
      <p>Ardoin defeated Democratic challenger Gwen Collins-Greenup in Saturday’s election.</p>
      <p>The runoff was a rematch of the special election Ardoin won last year.</p>
      <p>Ardoin was a top deputy to former Secretary of State Tom Schedler, a Republican who resigned in 2018 amid sexual harassment allegations. Ardoin took over the position, then won the election to serve the final year of Schedler's term.</p>
      <p>Collins-Greenup has worked in notary and real estate businesses and is a former city court administrator and clerk of court employee. She’s did little fundraising to compete for the position.</p>
      <p>The two contenders never faced off in a public forum ahead of the election.</p>
      <p>__</p>
      <p>8 p.m.</p>
      <p>Polls have closed in Louisiana, where a runoff election is deciding if the Deep South’s only Democratic governor can reach a second term despite opposition from President Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>Saturday’s competition between Democratic incumbent John Bel Edwards and Republican businessman Eddie Rispone is tight. Trump made three visits to Louisiana during the race, trying to keep Edwards from victory.</p>
      <p>The president particularly wants to capture Louisiana’s governorship for Republicans after Democrats ousted a GOP incumbent in Kentucky. Trump’s made the race a test of his political prowess amid the Democrats’ impeachment hearings in Washington.</p>
      <p>Edwards ran on state-specific issues, trying to steer clear of national politics.</p>
      <p>Also on the ballot was a rematch in the Louisiana secretary of state’s race between Republican incumbent Kyle Ardoin and Democratic challenger Gwen Collins-Greenup.</p>

      <p>Louisiana voters are settling the nation’s last 2019 gubernatorial contest Saturday. They are deciding whether to give the Deep South’s only Democratic governor a second term or replace him with a Republican businessman favored by President Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>Democratic incumbent John Bel Edwards faces a strong challenge from Republican businessman Eddie Rispone.</p>
      <p>Rispone hopes Trump’s coattails help him secure a victory in the crimson state where the president remains popular. Edwards hopes his performance across four years gives him the crossover support to win reelection.</p>
      <p>Also on the ballot are a rematch for Louisiana secretary of state, 29 legislative races that will determine if Republicans gain a House supermajority, and the competition for a vacant state Supreme Court seat.</p>
      <p>Polls close at 8 p.m. Saturday.</p>
