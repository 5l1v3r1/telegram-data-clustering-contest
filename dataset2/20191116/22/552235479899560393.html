      <h1>Rod Petrie promises to address the Hampden bugbear that annoys every supporter</h1>
      <h2>The SFA president is adamant that taking control of the ground from Queen's Park will make a big impact as he outlines 2030 World Cup dream.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T22:29:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 22:29</time> by <a rel="author">Scott McDermott, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/scott-mcdermott/</a></address>
      <p>Rod Petrie wants to have a revamped <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hampden-park">Hampden Park</a> in place to host games at the 2030 World Cup.</p>
      <p>The SFA president admits the fan experience at the national stadium is nowhere near good enough.</p>
      <p>But he hopes when they take full ownership of the ground in August, they can begin to make gradual improvements.</p>
      <p>And if the UK are successful in their proposed joint bid for the World Cup in a decade – he’d love to have a fully renovated Hampden as one of the key venues.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rod-petrie">Petrie</a> accepts that a lot of hard work – on both the bid and the stadium - will need to be done to make it happen.</p>
      <p>But as president, he’s determined to make Hampden a better place to go for supporters in the future.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Petrie said: “Hampden will be European class next summer when it hosts Euro 2020 games.</p>
      <p>“But we are in discussions with other home associations about a 2030 World Cup bid which would give us a 10-year timeline to look at Hampden as a host stadium for that.</p>
      <p>“We’d all be delighted with that because we want a stadium which is entirely appropriate for the best competition in the world.</p>
      <p>“It’s early stages and a lot of work has to be done. We take over the stadium in August after Euro 2020 and that’s been a game-changer.</p>
      <p>“With access to Hampden 365 days a year, we can find ways to enhance the revenue for the benefit of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/">Scottish football</a> – and that will mean some changes to the stadium.</p>

      <p>“We have to have a plan, a target, an objective to achieve. And the 2030 bid could give us that.</p>
      <p>“I’m not going to sit here and say Hampden is perfect. But decisions made in the past have delivered what it is today.</p>
      <p>“In terms of being European class there have been enhancements, like big screens and digital turnstile access.</p>
      <p>“These things will make it comparable to the 11 other venues at Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>“But the supporter experience, as we all know, doesn’t score very highly.</p>
      <p>“The reason for that is the 24 degree factor rate of the stands compared to a 34 degree rate at the likes of Easter Road or Tynecastle.</p>
      <p>“So that’s the challenge for us. If we are getting a new stadium, why are we getting it?</p>
      <p>“Because we want to make things better for Scottish football. Then it’s about the vision, in terms of the enhancements we can make.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“For domestic football, we have to make it atmospheric when it’s not full – but ready to rock when it’s full.</p>
      <p>“And that’s also relevant when it might be a neutral venue for other big games that we might attract.”</p>
      <p>The venue of the 2030 World Cup will be decided by FIFA in 2024 and if the UK are successful, the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-football-association">SFA </a>would then look at how to pay for a new Hampden.</p>
      <p>Income from qualifying for major tournaments would help – but Petrie says his board are capable of finding funds from elsewhere.</p>
      <p>He said: “We have to look at the creativity of the people on the SFA board.</p>
      <p>“We have a big change now, by taking over the ownership of Hampden.</p>
      <p>“Generating money from qualifying and doing great things on the pitch would be a strong contributor.</p>
      <p>“But we have to be more creative and see if there are other ways to bring funding to the party for the things we want to see done.”</p>
