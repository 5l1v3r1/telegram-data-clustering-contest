      <p>As the entire Arrowverse braces itself for the coming Crisis, <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/supergirl-tv/">Supergirl</a> has to deal with Leviathan and the fearsome Rama Khan.</p>
      <p>The CW has released the official episode synopsis for Season 5's midseason finale, the final episode before the series joins the rest of the Arrowverse in the "<a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/crisis-on-infinite-earths/">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a>" special. The finale's title, as <a href="https://www.cbr.com/supergirl-final-pre-crisis-episode-wrath-of-khan-homage/">revealed last month</a>, is a direct nod to the <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/star-trek/"><i>Star Trek</i></a> film <i>Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</i>.</p>

      <blockquote>Supergirl’s (Melissa Benoist) struggle against Leviathan reaches a boiling point as she faces off against Rama Khan (guest star Mitch Pileggi). Meanwhile, as Lena (Katie McGrath) and Hope (Andrea Brooks) work to launch Project Non Nocere, Hope proves to be an invaluable asset to Lena. Marcus Stokes directed the episode written by Lindsay Struman &amp; Jessica Kardos (#508). Original airdate 12/1/2019.</blockquote>

      <p>Rama Khan <a href="https://www.cbr.com/supergirl-krypton-new-villain-promo/">debuted earlier this season</a>, as a seemingly immortal supervillain who has proved more than a match for Kara. With Leviathan and Lena Luthor escalating their respective plans, Supergirl will certainly have her hands full before the <a href="https://screenrant.com/supergirl-season-5-crisis-infinite-earths-setup-theory/">Arrowverse crossover</a>.</p>
      <p>Airing Sundays at 9 p.m. ET/PT on The CW, Supergirl stars Melissa Benoist as Kara Danvers, David Harewood as Martian Manhunter, Mehcad Brooks as Jimmy Olsen and Chyler Leigh as Alex Danvers.</p>
