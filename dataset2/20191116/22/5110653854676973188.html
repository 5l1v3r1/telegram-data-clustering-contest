      <p>After being tackled late in the second quarter of the No. 4 Crimson Tide's 38-7 win over the Bulldogs, Tagovailoa remained on the ground in pain, tried to walk off with the help of trainers, but eventually needed to be carted off the field. The junior was later airlifted to St. Vincent's Medical Center, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/CecilHurt/status/1195795898535686144">Tuscaloosa News</a>.</p>
      <p>Senior Bowl director Jim Nagy had an earlier report, which suggestedthe injury was as bad as it looked.</p>

      <p>Late last month, Tagovailoa underwent ankle surgery that caused him to be a game-time decision Saturday. Coach Nick Saban said the hip injury was unrelated.</p>
      <p>When Tagovailoa went down, Saban immediately faced questions of whether the starting QB should have still been in a 35-7 game. The drive Tagovailoa was injured on was going to be his last series, Saban told ESPN during a halftime interview, but Alabama wanted the practice of running a 2-minute drill at the end of the quarter.</p>
      <p>Backup quarterback Mac Jones replaced Tagovailoa. A sophomore, Jones has attempted 67 passes at Alabama, throwing five touchdowns to one interception.</p>
