      <p>“Around 10 students” have been named in an FIR registered by the Delhi Police, after <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/jawaharlal-nehru">Jawaharlal Nehru</a> University Saturday filed a complaint at Vasant Kunj North police station against the “vandalism” and “defacement” of the Vivekananda statue on campus.</p>
      <p>“The FIR has been registered under Section 3 of the Delhi Prevention of Defacement of Property Act,” an officer said.</p>
      <p>The complaint filed by Buddha Singh, chairperson of Swami Vivekananda statue installation committee and additional dean of students, states: “It is requested to register a complaint… and take strict punitive action against the miscreants.”</p>
      <p>“On November 14, at 6:30 am, I received information that the statue has been vandalised by some students. I reached and saw the base of the statue has been vandalised with objectionable messages and the cloth covering it has been partially torn off…These messages are directed towards a political party and a group of people donning saffron coloured clothes. They are obscene in nature,” he wrote.</p>
