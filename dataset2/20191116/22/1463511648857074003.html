      <h1>Cooperative societies want review of Act to meet international best practices</h1>

      <p>The Cooperative Rating and Award Society of Nigeria has appealed to the National Assembly to review the Nigerian Cooperative Act of 2004 to meet international best practices.</p>
      <p>The President of CRASON, Victor Oyegoke, made the appeal at the 2nd National Cooperative Awards and Symposium organised by the society in Abuja on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Oyegoke noted the law was outdated and was no longer in tandem with current realities in the sector.</p>
      <p>He also appealed to the Federal Government to support cooperatives, adding that they were contributing enormously to the Gross Domestic Product of the country.</p>
      <p>According to him, cooperative is contributing over N1 trillion to the GDP.</p>
      <p>They also create more than 600,000 employments both directly and indirectly in the country.</p>
      <p>“This is a very vital sector that the government needs to see how they can key into; we have over 30 million individual members and over 300,000 cooperatives.</p>
      <p>“Our law is outdated, we need to review it to accommodate the realities on ground and the government can help us.</p>
      <p>“There is a law reviewed already that has been sent to the Federal Executive Council.</p>
      <p>“FEC should help us send to the National Assembly for scrutiny and passage.</p>
      <p>“There is need for a platform to call stakeholders to review the Act to meet up with the current realities of global best practices.”</p>
      <p>Akintola Akintoye, the Chairman CRASON Advisory Board, said the objective of the society was to rate the operations of cooperative societies and proffer awards.</p>
      <p>Akintoye noted that the move was targeted towards encouraging deserving cooperatives.</p>
      <p>“Cooperative in Nigeria is a bit down because the sector is not 24th century compliant.</p>
      <p>“To be 24th century compliant, the knowledge base of practitioners need to be upgraded.</p>
      <p>“We need massive injection of funds for capacity training.”</p>
      <p>Shimite Bello, the Chief Executive Officer of the Quintessential Women Association, said that adequate information and technology was crucial to boost the operations of cooperatives in the country.</p>
      <p>Bello, in a lecture entitled: “Strengthening Cooperatives to serve as Catalyst for Nigeria’s Sustainable Socio-Economic Development,” called for more training for cooperative members to ensure proper management of loans.</p>
      <p>The News Agency of Nigeriareports that no fewer than 40 different cooperatives and individuals would bag the 2019 CRASON’s award for their outstanding operations.</p>
