      <p>Jose Mourinho told Manchester United NOT to pay more than £50million for Harry Maguire – and ended up costing the Reds a cool £20million.</p>
      <p>Maguire, 26, became the world’s most expensive defender last summer when he moved to Old Trafford from <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> in a deal worth £80million.</p>
      <p>But United had first registered their interest in the centre-back 12 months earlier when Mourinho had put him on his wish-list – and was lined up to make the switch for £60million.</p>
      <p>United, however, backed out of talks with the Foxes when Mourinho told club bosses that paying a penny more than £50million would “embarrass him.”</p>

      <p>A club insider said: “A move was made for Maguire in the summer of 2018 – with Jose Mourinho’s blessing.</p>
      <p>“But Jose’s interest in signing the player came with a proviso. He said that while Maguire was an excellent player, he wasn’t worth more than £50million.</p>
      <p>“In fact, he said paying more than £50million would embarrass him.</p>

      <p>“The club was armed with that valuation when they spoke to Leicester – who immediately made it clear they would not sell Maguire for less than £60million.</p>
      <p>“The deal was dead before United had even made a formal bid – and when it was decided to move for Maguire again a year later, his price had gone up to £80million.”</p>
      <p>Mourinho was sacked four months into the season - still complaining that Unite had failed to land his top transfer targets.</p>
      <p>It was Leicester’s refusal to budge on the price that prompted <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> to drop their interest in Sheffield-born Maguire.</p>
      <p>His form since arriving at United has mirrored that of the team, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men struggling for consistency.</p>
      <p>But Solskjaer has still seen enough of his record recruit to make him captain in the absence of club skipper Ashley Young.</p>
