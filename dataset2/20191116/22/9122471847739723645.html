      <h1>Michigan Releases Video Of Locker Room Celebration vs. Michigan State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T22:48:43+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 22:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>The Michigan Wolverines made a statement this weekend as they dismantled the Michigan State Spartans. Following the game, Jim Harbaugh and his players threw quite the celebration.</p>
      <p>Michigan received a dominant performance from Shea Patterson, who threw for 384 yards and four touchdowns.</p>
      <p>All the criticism that Michigan dealt with earlier in the season is officially gone. Harbaugh has the team playing its best football in recent memory.</p>
      <p>Even though Michigan State has struggled this season, Michigan was thrilled to pick up a win over its in-state rival.</p>
      <p>While addressing his team in the locker room, Harbaugh yelled “Who’s got it better than us?”</p>
      <p>Once the coaching staff was done speaking to the players, they brought out the Paul Bunyan Trophy and allowed the locker room to go crazy for a few minutes.</p>
      <p>Here’s the video of what went down in the locker room:</p>

      <p>Blowing out your in-state rival by 34 points does call for a celebration.</p>
      <p>Michigan has to keep this momentum going as it has a tough road matchup next weekend against Indiana. It’ll be the final away game on the schedule for the Wolverines.</p>
      <p>Just imagine how crazy the locker room would be if Michigan manages to defeat Ohio State in the regular-season finale.</p>
