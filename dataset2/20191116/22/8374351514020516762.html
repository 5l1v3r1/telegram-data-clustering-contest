      <p>The Department of Agriculture (DA) had sought help from World Bank to fund more than ₱25 billion worth of projects on top of the ₱27-billion Philippine Rural Development Project (PRDP), which is poised to get additional budget soon.</p>

      <p>In a statement, the DA said it has received “firm commitment” from World Bank (WB) to finance four of its proposed projects aimed at enhancing agri-fishery extension systems, providing livelihood assistance to fisherfolk and indigenous peoples (IPs), and updating the national farmers’ registry system.</p>
      <p>The proposed projects include the US$200-million provincial agricultural and fishery extension delivery system; $200-million coastal resilience and fisheries development project; and $100-million Mindanao inclusive agriculture development project.</p>
      <p>The first project is a new proposal, while the other two are now being evaluated by the World Bank.</p>
      <p>Aside from these, the DA also sought World Bank’s attendance to update and enhance the registry system for basic sectors in agriculture (RSBSA) that will contain, among other information, a list of legitimate farmers and fishers nationwide.</p>
      <p>“With an updated RSBSA, we will be able to focus the delivery of needed services and initiatives to our clienteles — most especially small farmers and fisherfolk — more effectively and efficiently,” said Agriculture Secretary William Dar.<br/>For this, the DA didn’t mention how much money it will need.</p>
      <p>The aforementioned projects are on top of the World Bank-funded PRDP, the largest project that the multilateral development bank is currently funding in the Philippines.</p>
      <p>Just more than a week into office, Dar said in August that World Bank is open to lend the Philippine agriculture sector additional loan worth US$640 million, or around ₱44 billion, within the next few months.</p>
      <p>“PRDP has a budget of almost US$760 million. There is a plan for World Bank to add fund… for the additional loan of US$240 million for PRDP,” Dar said earlier.</p>
      <p>Launched in 2013, PRDP began as a farm-to-market road (FMR) initiative and was eventually expanded to cover several livelihood components meant to improve the lives of agriculture workers in the country.</p>
