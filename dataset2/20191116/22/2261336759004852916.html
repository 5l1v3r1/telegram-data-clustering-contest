      <h1>Joe Rogan and Israel Adesanya believe Jorge Masvidal is UFC championship material: ‘He’s a different person now’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T22:30:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Mckeever</a></address>
      <p>Jorge Masvidal has undergone a serious transformation in the last year, going from a highly technical but overly cautious striker to a straight-up ‘bad motherf-cker’.</p>
      <p>Following back-to-back defeats to Demian Maia and Stephen Thompson in 2017, Masvidal has rebounded by accumulating three straight stoppage wins over Darren Till, Ben Askren and Nate Diaz, beating the latter in the UFC 244 main event to capture the ‘BMF’ title.</p>
      <p>While UFC commentator Joe Rogan and newly-minted UFC middleweight champ Israel Adesanya aren’t sold on the ‘BMF’ belt, both agree ‘Gamebred’ is championship material.</p>
      <p>“I feel like Masvidal is world championship caliber,” podcast host Rogan told Adesanya on a recent episode of JRE (h/t <a href="https://www.bjpenn.com/mma-news/ufc/joe-rogan-and-israel-adesanya-sing-the-praises-of-jorge-masvidal/">BJPenn.com</a>). “100%”</p>
      <p>“100%,” Adesanya agreed. “I’ve been a fan of that guy since way back. Everyone’s just finding out now, Street Jesus. I’m not a hipster like ‘oh, I knew him before he was cool man,’ I don’t want to be that guy, but I like his resurrection. I like how he rebranded himself. You have to do that. I see it in movies, I see actors do it, entertainment, you rebrand, new package, and then <i>boom</i>.”</p>

      <p>“He’s a different person now,” Rogan added. “Now he’s what he could have been. He is potential realized. He’s at 100% right now. He beat the f—k out of Diaz in that first round,” Rogan said. Adesanya followed by complimenting Masvidal’s kicks.”</p>
      <p>Masvidal, who is currently ranked #3 in the UFC welterweight rankings, is expected to challenge the winner of the upcoming title bout between Kamaru Usman and Colby Covington at UFC 245. The highly anticipated PPV takes place next month, Dec. 14 at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.</p>
