      <p><i>Knives and Skin</i> is an IFC Midnight movie to a tee, delivering a strange, chilling vision of a small town rocked by the disappearance of a teenage girl. When Carolyn Harper (<b>Raven Whitley</b>) goes missing, it disrupts the happy lives of the CW-ready teens and their image-obsessed parents. And things only get weirder from there. All vibrant, saturated colors and off-kilter neon lights, <i>Knives and Skin</i> looks destined to be a cult classic raved about at horror film festivals, and reviews certainly suggest as much, with critics <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/knives_and_skin">praising</a> its hallucinatory fever dream visuals, queer representation, and macabre humor.</p>
      <p><b>Jennifer Reeder</b> directs <i>Knives and Skin</i> which also stars <b>Marika Engelhardt</b>, <b>Audrey</b> <b>Francis</b>, <b>Tim</b> <b>Hopper</b>, and <b>Kate Arrington.</b></p>
      <p>Here is the synopsis to <i>Knives and Skin</i>:</p>
      <blockquote>What happened to Carolyn Harper? Part suburban nightmare, part neon-soaked teenage fever dream, this tantalizing mystery traces the wave of fear and distrust that spreads across a small Midwestern town in the wake of a high school girl’s mysterious disappearance. As the loneliness and darkness lurking beneath the veneer of everyday life gradually comes to light, a collective awakening seems to overcome the town’s teenage girls—gathering in force until it can no longer be contained. Unfolding in a hallucinatory haze of lushly surreal images, Knives and Skin is a one-of-a-kind coming-of-age noir that haunts like a half-remembered dream.</blockquote>
      <p><i>Knives and Skin</i> hits theaters, On Demand and digital on <b>December 6, 2019.</b></p>
