      <p>Head coach Craig Dickenson clearly had the response that Rider Nation has been waiting for regarding the health of Saskatchewan Roughriders quarterback Cody Fajardo.</p>
      <p>“Cody had a full week of practice and he will be the starter,” Dickenson stated during Saturday’s media availability in advance of Sunday’s CFL West final against the visiting Winnipeg Blue Bombers.</p>
      <p>“He has shown that he’s healthy and he will have some soreness and stiffness. He has shown he can execute and run the offence the way that we need to. We feel like he will be good.”</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/roughriders-head-coach-craig-dickenson-confirms-that-cody-fajardo-will-play-sundays-west-division-final">Fajardo has been sidelined since suffering an injured oblique muscle during a practice on Oct. 30. Whether Fajardo can go the distance with the injury, remains to be seen.</a>
      </p>
      <p>“Everybody on the field knows that you’re one big shot from being injured and he’s no different,” Dickenson said. “It hasn’t affected his mobility at all. We feel like he will be able to move and elude the pass rush like he has.</p>
      <p>“We’re hopeful that not practising a lot doesn’t make him rusty, but he’s done a good job in meetings and really being focused on what’s going on.”</p>
      <p>Fajardo initially said he felt like he had been stabbed and the pain from the injury was so intense that it dropped him to his knees.</p>
      <p>He was sidelined for the Riders’ 23-13 win over the Edmonton Eskimos on Nov. 2 that clinched first place in the West Division.</p>
      <p>“All things considered, it’s the best I’ve felt since the injury,” said Fajardo, adding he will expand on the severity of the injury after the season.</p>
      <p>“(The recovery) has been frustrating, taxing body-wise and mentally a little bit taxing. The medical staff did a tremendous job. We uncovered every stone possible to get me feeling as comfortable and confident as I can be.”</p>
      <p>Given the uncertainty of Fajardo’s injury, backups <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/riders-backup-qb-isaac-harker-is-ready-to-go-if-needed">Isaac Harker</a> and <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/bennett-moving-up-on-riders-quarterback-depth-chart">Bryan Bennett</a> are prepared to play on Sunday. Harker started in the Riders’ win over the Eskimos, completing 23 of 28 passes for 213 yards without any touchdowns or interceptions.</p>
      <p>“At any given moment in any given game, you can play all three quarterbacks,” Fajardo said. “You saw that with us in our first game against Hamilton. Zach (Collaros) went down, I got in concussion protocol, and Isaac had to play. It was one of the rare instances where you saw the third-stringer get meaningful reps in a game.</p>
      <p>“That comes in any given situation where you have a guy who is a little bit nicked up. If things don’t go according to plan (Sunday), then I would be removed from the game.”</p>
      <p>The Riders and Fajardo have been cautious in their approach to the injury and have limited his pass attempts.</p>
      <p>“Anytime you have an injury, you have to make up for it with your mind,” Fajardo said. “Early on in the bye week, I wasn’t at home resting. I was in the locker room watching film while those guys were out there practising.</p>
      <p>“You have to find a way to be productive, even though you can’t be physically productive. I think I did a good job of that.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>ZACH IS BACK</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sunday’s game marks a reunion of sorts, with Collaros slated to start for the Blue Bombers.</p>
      <p>Collaros began the season with the Riders, only to suffer a concussion on the third play of the regular-season opener due to an illegal hit to the head.</p>
      <p>Fajardo took over as the Riders’ No. 1 quarterback and performed so well that Collaros was eventually traded to the Toronto Argonauts. The Argonauts later sent Collaros to Blue Bombers, who were desperate for a quarterback, at the Oct. 9 trade deadline.</p>
      <p>“Zach is my enemy (Sunday), but after that we’ll be friends,” Fajardo said. “In between the 60 minutes, I want to beat the man across from me.</p>
      <p>“I’m just excited for him that he got a good fit in Winnipeg. It seems like he went in there and they welcomed him with open arms. It’s pretty cool to see for a guy who had been traded twice in one year.”</p>
