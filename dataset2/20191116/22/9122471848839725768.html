      <h1>LeBron James Sends Message To Colin Kaepernick Before His Workout</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T22:33:56+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 22:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>On Saturday afternoon, ESPN NFL insider Adam Schefter revealed the <a href="https://thespun.com/more/top-stories/colin-kaepernick-workout-being-moved-location">location of Colin Kaepernick’s workout for NFL scouts changed last minute</a>.</p>
      <p>Initially the workout was set to happen at the Atlanta Falcons training facility. However, just over an hour before the workout was scheduled to begin, Kaepernick’s camp decided to move the location.</p>
      <p>They released a statement revealing the decision for the change. The NFL did not want media to attend and film the workout, so Kaepernick changed the location to allow media and the fans to see the workout for themselves.</p>
      <p>Before the workout start, NBA star LeBron James sent a message to Kaepernick.</p>
      <p>“Best of luck to Colin Kaepernick in his workout today! Pulling for you over here Young King!!! Regardless the outcome you’re SPECIAL and I thank you for being TRUE!” James said in the tweet.</p>

      <p>The former star quarterback hasn’t played in the NFL since 2016, though not for lack of trying. More than 25 NFL teams were reportedly planning to attend the workout – though that was before the location change.</p>
      <p>It’s unclear if every NFL team that intended to attend the NFL-sanctioned workout is now at the high school.</p>
      <p>Stay tuned for the latest on Kaepernick’s workout and future options.</p>
