      <p>IMF Head of Mission Ron van Rooden has expressed hope that the reform momentum would be maintained and accelerated.</p>
      <p>On November 15, 2019, Prime Minister of Ukraine Oleksiy Honcharuk and Minister of Finance of Ukraine Oksana Markarova met with the Mission of the International Monetary Fund in Ukraine, namely Head of Mission Mr. Ron van Rooden and mission's economist Gabor Pula, the Cabinet press service reported.</p>
      <p>During the meeting, the parties discussed the conditions for opening of a new 3-year EFF Arrangement.</p>
      <p>"Ukraine has demonstrated and preserves its progress in the implementation of the reforms declared by the President, our Government and Parliament. In recent weeks, the Ukrainian Parliament has adopted a draft law on the turnover of agricultural land as a basis, and passed a bill on unbundling as basis and as whole. The latter has already been signed by the President. Therefore, we are looking forward to agreeing on a new long-term extended fund facility in the near future," stressed Oleksiy Honcharuk.</p>
      <p>The IMF Head of Mission, in turn, noted the importance of the reforms that the Ukrainian authorities had successfully pursued recently, and expressed hope that their momentum would be maintained and accelerated.</p>
      <p>As UNIAN reported earlier, the IMF staff mission started its Ukraine visit November 14.</p>
      <p>The National Bank has estimated the potential volume of the new EFF Arrangement at $5billion--$10 billion and suggested that the first tranche of $2 billion will be received as early as this year.</p>
