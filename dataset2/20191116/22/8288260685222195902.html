      <h1>Manchester United problem revealed - and it will encourage Aston Villa</h1>
      <h2>Latest Aston Villa news | AVFC take on the Red Devils in the Premier League at the start of next month</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T22:20:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 22:20</time> by <a rel="author">Shane Ireland, https://www.facebook.com/ShaneIrelandJournalist, Mark Wakefield</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United defender Victor Lindelof has admitted that the Red Devils have a recurring problem in the Premier League this season.</p>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side have come under scrutiny this season for not managing to put together a consistent run of wins, and Lindelof admits that is a problem for the club.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> are due to travel to Old Trafford at the start of next month, United defender Lindelof reckons complacency is kicking in far too often in games his side are expected to win.</p>
      <p>United endured their worst start to a season in 30 years under Solskjaer and although things have improved recently, they are still well behind the Champions League-chasing pack.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Crystal Palace, West Ham, Newcastle and Bournemouth have already beaten them this season and Lindelof told <a href="https://www.aftonbladet.se/sportbladet/fotboll/a/zGzjXr/lindelof-jag-ville-inte-visa-hur-orolig-jag-var">Sport Bladet:</a> “I generally think there is one thing we need to get better at if we are going to get back to the level Manchester United should be at; winning matches week in and week out.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes it does not have to be neat, but you should win anyway. Then a few days go by and we meet a slightly lower team, then we have to go in exactly the same way, not get comfortable.</p>
      <p>“Those tendencies have existed even in these matches. We start well, play fast and get to positions – but then we stop with it after 20 minutes, complicate it and play poorly.”</p>
