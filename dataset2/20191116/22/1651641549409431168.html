      <h1>Huawei might be in for a much shorter 2-week trade reprieve</h1>

      <p>The US is gearing up to grant Huawei a 2-week extension to allow it to minimise disruption with US businesses which rely on it for business purposes, Reuters reported. The US had previously granted two 90 day extensions, and this 14-day one is a far cry from what US businesses<a href="https://mspoweruser.com/us-offers-another-90-day-reprieve-for-huawei/"> received earlier in the year.</a> On the one hand, the Commerce Department is trying to wean carriers off Huawei’s telecommunications technology. On the other hand, they can’t do so fast enough, causing these endless delays.</p>
      <p>“There are enough problems with telephone service in the rural communities – we don’t want to knock them out. So, one of the main purposes of the temporary general licenses is to let those rural guys continue to operate,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said.</p>
      <p>The US may eventually grant Huawei leave to trade with Google, Microsoft, and others soon. While it was reported that this was certain to happen, the Department of Commerce has yet to grant requests for any licenses ever since the ban was issued.</p>
