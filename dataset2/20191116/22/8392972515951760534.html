      <p>Vinnie Jones offered to step down from <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/x-factor/">The X Factor</a>: Celebrity tonight (Saturday November 16) after landing in the bottom two.</p>
      <p>But Simon Cowell refused to let him leave and instead sent home Kevin McHale.</p>
      <p>Vinnie faced the former Glee star in the sing off.</p>

      <p>But once the two had performed, Vinnie insisted on speaking directly to the judges before they voted.</p>
      <p>He said: "I've had a fantastic time, I've really enjoyed it, it's been everything I needed since my wife passed.</p>
      <p>"This guy is a fantastic singer, I think he can win it, for his career, I would like to step down."</p>
      <p>But Simon insisted on having the final say and with both him and Vinnie's mentor Nicole Scherzinger opting to save Vinnie, Kevin's time in the competition was over.</p>

      <p>Simon said the last person he wanted to argue with was Vinnie, but he was willing to take the risk to keep him in the show.</p>
      <p>Kevin took the news well, and said everyone had done brilliantly tonight.</p>
      <p>Fans at home were shocked at the turn of events - with many insisting Simon was in the wrong not letting Vinnie leave graciously, and slammed him for making the show a joke.</p>

      <p>Earlier in the evening, viewers were <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/x-factor-celebrity-viewers-divided-over-megan-mckennas-performance/">left divided over Megan McKenna's performance.</a></p>
      <p>The former TOWIE star has been the runaway favourite week after week, performing beautiful self-penned songs and wowing both the public and the judges.</p>
      <p>But as she took to the stage to sing another ballad she had written herself, fans were left torn.</p>
      <p>While many insisted she was their winner, others felt it was a bit repetitive.</p>

      </p>
      <p>In fact, Nicole also agreed and said although the performance and vocals were stunning, she was hoping Megan would do something a bit more uptempo.</p>
      <p>Simon told her the performance was "as good as week one", but that he also wanted to see her more whacky side.</p>

      <p>In response, Megan said: "I can do uptempo, but I love to sing songs from my heart and put everything into it."</p>
      <p>Elswhere, fans hit out at the new format after the safe seats were ditched when Simon said the public didn't like them.</p>
      <p>And the star guest performer, Lizzo, took to the stage at the start of the show rather than halfway through.</p>

      <p>Viewers were also furious with the first ad break coming just SIX minutes in, with many hitting out at the format overall.</p>
