      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> are set for key talks with Tahith Chong’s representatives this week as the club bid to thwart interest from <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/juventus/">Juventus</a>.</p>
      <p>The winger is out of contract at the end of the season and is free to sign pre-contract agreements with foreign clubs in January.</p>
      <p>Chong remains on a basic wage at Old Trafford but United have already offered to significantly increase his salary to a figure that could reach £25,000-a-week with bonuses included.</p>
      <p>Reports that Chong had already decided to move on are wide off the mark but United still face a battle to convince the 19-year-old to stay at the club.</p>

      <p>But sources have told <i>Metro.co.uk</i> that United are confident Chong will eventually sign a contract and that the club can point to his integration this term into the first team as a signal of his progress.</p>

      <p>The teenager has made four appearances so far this season and is likely to feature in both of United’s remaining <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/europa-league/">Europa League</a> matches following their qualification for the last-32.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ole-gunnar-solskjaer/">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> has made the promotion of academy prospects a central aspect of his tenure and Chong is viewed as one of the most promising.</p>
      <p>Though Chong’s yet to shine in the first team, United remain convinced that he has what it takes to make it; provided he trusts in their handling of his future.</p>
      <p>Juventus’ policy of snapping up out-of-contract talent has proved fruitful in recent years and they made a hefty £89million in allowing Paul Pogba to return to Old Trafford in 2016.</p>
      <p>But United feel Chong is on the right track and they accept that his failure so far to impress in the first team may have been down to their hastiness in giving youngsters such as himself and Angel Gomes chances before they’re ready.</p>
      <p>That’s why United may look to send the pair out on loan in January but they’ll look to tie both players down to long-term deals before sending them elsewhere.</p>
