      <h4>Anastasia ‘Stassie’ Karanikolaou stepped out looking amazing in a white crop top that showed off her fit abs and tight black leggings as she attended a gallery opening in Los Angeles on Nov. 15.</h4>
      <p><b>Anastasia “Stassie” Karanikolaou</b>, 22, aka <b>Kylie Jenner</b>‘s BFF was seen looking absolutely gorgeous in Los Angeles, CA on Nov. 15! The blonde beauty stepped out in a stylish outfit that included a white crop top and black tight leggings when she attended a gallery opening in the City of Angels and she flaunted a confident strut as she let her long hair down and wore matching black boots. She also showed off her toned abs underneath her top as she accessorized with a diamond bracelet and revealed the arm tattoo she got with Kylie in honor of Kylie’s one-year-old daughter <b>Stormi</b>.</p>
      <p>Before her latest L.A. night out, Stassie, who has known Kylie for nine years, made headlines for stirring up rumors of a romance with the makeup mogul’s older brother, <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/celeb/rob-kardashian/"><b>Rob Kardashian</b></a>, 32. The rumors first started after Stassie and Rob were photographed looking cozy at <b>Kendall Jenner</b>‘s Halloween birthday party on Oct. 31. The famous hunk <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/11/01/rob-kardashian-stassie-pda-halloween-party-photo/">was seen putting his hand on her waist</a> while getting out of a car to go into the party venue and it definitely got the attention of many onlookers who suspected something more than friendship may be going on behind the scenes.</p>
      <p>Before jumping to conclusions, though, a source EXCLUSIVELY told <b>HollywoodLife</b> that Stassie and Rob are not dating and people are “reading way too much into” his simple gesture. “There is absolutely nothing going on between Rob and Stassie,” the source <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/11/02/rob-kardashian-stassie-romance-truth/">EXCLUSIVELY told us</a> on Nov. 2. “They have known each other for a long time and he simply looks at her as one of his little sister’s friends.”</p>
