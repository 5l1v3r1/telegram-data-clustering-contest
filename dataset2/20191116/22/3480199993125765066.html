      <p>Jenner is tasked with collecting tokens via a dizzying leap alongside former Girls Aloud singer Nadine Coyle.</p>
      <p>In scenes to air when the show return on Sunday, Jenner will comfort the terrified Coyle before the jump.</p>
      <p>The leap is one of the perilous methods the 10 contestants will use to arrive at camp, as a reunited Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly watch on.</p>
      <p>After a brief meet and greet, they will be seen swimming from a luxury yacht to shore, trying to secure their choice of partner to become a “power” pairing, which will enjoy special privileges in the camp.</p>

      <p>When the pairs are established, the terrified celebrities must face skydives, canoeing, and dizzying planks suspended hundreds of feet in the air.</p>
      <p>Former Arsenal favourite Ian Wright is one of the contestants who faces the high-wire challenge.</p>
      <p>He is joined on the show by singer Myles Stephenson, DJs Adele Roberts and Roman Kemp, comedian Andrew Maxwell, soap star Jacqueline Jossa, ex-England rugby player James Haskell and presenter Kate Garraway.</p>
      <p>I’m A Celebrity returns on Sunday evening at 9pm.</p>
