      <h1>Brandon Williams comes from boxing family and mean streak is impressing Man Utd team-mates</h1>
      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Brandon Williams is the new Man Utd academy graduate, having made his full Premier League debut just before the international break, but he has a feisty side</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T22:30:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Steve Bates, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/steve-bates/</a></address>
      <p>Brandon Williams is fighting his way to the top at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> .</p>
      <p>The teenage left-back has wowed boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and United fans since bursting on to the scene.</p>
      <p>And his impressive performances have left Luke Shaw – injured since August – battling for his Old Trafford future.</p>
      <p>Williams’ progress has been so fast and impressive that senior members of Solskjaer’s coaching staff believe he is on track to overtake Shaw – and has the potential to become United’s number one THIS season.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old starlet takes no prisoners – and club insiders say that even United hard man Marcos Rojo admires the youngster’s aggression and tenacity.</p>

      <p>And no wonder. Williams is a ­cousin of Super Feather-weight English boxing champion Zelfa Barrett – and clearly shares his love of getting stuck in after a string of dust-ups since breaking through to the first team.</p>
      <p>After being booked in his first senior game – the EFL Cup win over Rochdale in September – Williams showed he’s not one to back down after squaring up to Dani de Wit on his full debut in the Europa League draw against AZ Alkmaar in Holland.</p>
      <p>Williams also jostled with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> star Callum Hudson-Odoi in the EFL cup victory over Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, sending the England star over an advertising hoarding.</p>
      <p>And he clashed with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> attacker Neal Maupay in a similar tussle on his full Premier League debut ahead of the international break.</p>

      <p>Solskjaer and his staff are happy for England Under-20 star Williams to use his natural fire and competitiveness to get physical – as long as he stays within the rules.</p>
      <p>But he was warned by United coaches to cool it after being sent off in a pre-season friendly for head-butting Accrington Stanley captain Sean McConville.</p>
      <p>A source at United’s Carrington training ground said: “Brandon is making a big name for himself, especially among the senior players.</p>
      <p>“He is a talented footballer and everyone likes his attitude and willingness to get stuck in.</p>
      <p>“He’s got a mean streak that Marcos Rojo loves! Everyone inside the club thinks he’s got a big future ahead of him, and that’s been recognised with the manager happy to play him against Brighton.</p>
      <p>“There’s a lot of talk that he’s the future at left-back, sooner rather than later.</p>
      <p>“Trent Alexander-Arnold has been fast-tracked at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> and everyone can see the same happening with Brandon.”</p>
      <p>Williams’ eagerness to give everything for the cause is earning an army of United fans. But his rise is doing nothing for Shaw’s faltering career at Old Trafford.</p>
