      <p>The Saskatchewan Roughriders are about to travel down Memory Lane — as in Gary Lane.</p>
      <p>When <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/football-comes-first-for-the-family-of-saskatchewan-roughriders-quarterback-cody-fajardo">Cody Fajardo</a> calls signals in Sunday’s CFL West Division final against the visiting Winnipeg Blue Bombers, the Roughriders will use a quarterback in the playoffs in same year as his first CFL start for the first time in nearly half a century.</p>
      <p>For the deciding game of the 1970 West final, Lane replaced the injured <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/ron-lancasters-legendary-last-game-robs-green-time-machine">Ron Lancaster</a> against the visiting Calgary Stampeders. Calgary won 15-14 on a last-second field goal by Larry Robinson.</p>
      <p>Before Lane, the Roughriders had not gone with a first-year starting quarterback in a playoff game since Larry Isbell, back in 1954.</p>
      <p>Isbell started Game 2 of a two-game, total-points Western Interprovincial Football Union semi-final in place of Frank Tripucka (hip injury).</p>
      <p>In 2009, the Roughriders won the West during <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/durant-and-dressler-a-tale-of-two-rider-legends-robs-green-time-machine">Darian Durant</a>‘s first full season as a starter. However, Durant had also started four games in 2008.</p>
