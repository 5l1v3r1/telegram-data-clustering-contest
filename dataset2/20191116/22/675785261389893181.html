      <h1>Liverpool midfielder Adam Lallana transfer target for PSG as Edinson Cavani replacement</h1>
      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: PSG have just seen Edinson Cavani depart the Ligue 1 champions to join LA Galaxy and the French giants are looking at Liverpool star Adam Lallana to take his place</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T22:30:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Neil Moxley, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/neil-moxley/</a></address>
      <p>Adam Lallana is on the radar of Paris St Germain.</p>
      <p>The England international is wanted by the French champs who have just seen Edinson Cavani depart for America.</p>
      <p>Cavani is moving to LA Galaxy to fill the hole left by Zlatan Ibrahimovic – and that has opened up an opportunity for Lallana.</p>
      <p>The Reds’ star, who has struggled with injuries during the past 12 months, is out-of-contract this summer and will be free to negotiate a bumper deal with the monied French club.</p>
      <p>Lallana earns £7million-a-season on Merseyside and his lack of playing time has shown Jurgen Klopp that he can live without the forward.</p>

      <p>The Reds’ could use that money for Ryan Fraser who has been linked strongly with a move to Anfield.</p>
      <p>The Scot is asking £100,000-a-week from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> to re-sign for Eddie Howe’s Cherries and that outlay, particularly on a free transfer, would be more than offset by Lallana disappearing from the club’s wage bill.</p>
      <p>Lallana, who has also been linked with clubs in China and the MLS recently, netted the Reds' equaliser in their 1-1 draw with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> earlier this season.</p>

      <p>Afterwards Klopp had high praise for the midfielder.</p>
      <p>“A wonderful story. A wonderful, wonderful, wonderful story," the German said.</p>
      <p>“This weekend we had a long talk in general about our situation, and he is completely relaxed and fine and knows how difficult it is at the moment to come into the team.</p>
      <p>“But he just trains well and he deserved that; it was 25-30 minutes and he had a proper impact. Then scoring a goal… wow! That was really, really nice.</p>
      <p>“Then the heart rate went up a bit because VAR was involved – but he said he knew it would not be offside, so that was all fine. A wonderful story. A wonderful, wonderful story.</p>
      <p>“It would have been a better story if somebody would have scored a second one, but now we have to take that.”</p>
