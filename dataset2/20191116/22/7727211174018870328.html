      <p>Prince Andrew has denied allegations he was sexually involved with a teenager in an interview about his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>He told <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/bbc">BBC Newsnight</a> 's Emily Maitlis that a medical condition meant he "didn't sweat" as she described and that he spent the night he was supposed to have met Virginia Roberts Giuffre at home after his daughter's pizza party.</p>
      <p>The 59-year-old was interviewed by <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/bbc">BBC Newsnight</a> 's Emily Maitlis at Buckingham Palace on Thursday, but the interview was aired on Saturday night. </p>
      <p>Jeffrey Epstein was found dead on August 10, while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.</p>
      <p>Ms Roberts Giuffre, one of 16 women who have accused Epstein of wrongdoing, said in an interview that Epstein had directed her to have sex with other men including Prince Andrew - an accusation which Prince Andrew strongly denies.</p>
      <p>When Ms Maitlis asked the Prince about Ms Robert’s allegations that he was sweating when they danced in Tramp nightclub, the Prince said it was impossible, the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/prince-andrew-interview-live-duke-20895964">Mirror Online reports.</a></p>

      <p>“There’s a slight problem with the sweating,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I have a peculiar medical condition.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t sweat at the time because I had suffered what I would describe as an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands War when I was shot at and I simply... it was almost impossible for me to sweat.”</p>
      <p>He said that night <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/prince-andrew-didnt-sex-accuser-20897916">he remembered going to a Pizza Express in Woking with his daughter</a> , Princess Beatrice.</p>
      <p>Ms Matilis also asked the Prince why he stayed with convicted sex offender Epstein in 2011.</p>
      <p>Maitlis said: “He was released in July, within months by December of 2010 you went to stay with him at his New York mansion, why?</p>
      <p>“Why were you staying with a convicted sex offender?</p>
      <p>Andrew answered: “Right, I have always…ever since this has happened and since this has become, as it were, public knowledge that I was there, I’ve questioned myself as to why did I go and what was I doing and was it the right thing to do?</p>
      <p>“Now, I went there with the sole purpose of saying to him that because he had been convicted, it was inappropriate for us to be seen together.</p>
      <p>“And I had a number of people counsel me in both directions, either to go and see him or not to go and see him and I took the judgement call that because this was serious and I felt that doing it over the telephone was the chicken’s way of doing it. I had to go and see him and talk to him.”</p>

      <p>At the end of it all Maitlis asked whether the Prince felt shameful about his association with Epstein.</p>
      <p>“Do you feel guilt regret or shame?” she said.</p>
      <p>Prince Andrew: “It was the wrong decision to see Epstein in 2010.</p>
      <p>“As far as my association with him is concerned, it had some serious beneficial aspects to areas we aren’t discussing today.”</p>
      <p>“On balance, would I choose to have never met Jeffrey Epstein?</p>
      <p>“Probably not.”</p>
