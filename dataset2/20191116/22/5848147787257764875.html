      <h1>A-League: Jets upset United as all eyes turn to Sydney FC v Victory</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T22:06:43+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 22:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/newdaily/" target="_blank">The New Daily</a></address>
      <p>The A-League season is starting to heat up, with Newcastle Jets upsetting Western United 1-0 in Geelong ahead of Sunday’s big Melbourne Victory v Sydney FC clash.</p>
      <p>Newcastle deservedly took the lead after 36 minutes through 19-year-old striker Angus Thurgate and while United grew into the game, they were unable to find a response at GMHBA Stadium on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Matt Millar found Thurgate, who showed some terrific hold-up play to one-touch the ball to Dimi Petratos and continue his run.</p>
      <p>Petratos fed a well-weighted ball back through to Thurgate, who slid a delightful finish past Kurto for his second career A-League goal and the Jets first win of the season.</p>
      <p>In the other match Adelaide reeled off three A-League wins in a row for the first time since its 2015-16 championship after cruising to a 3-1 victory over Central Coast.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Sydney FC captain Alex Wilkinson says underdone Robbie Kruse will still pose a serious threat should he make his A-League return in the Big Blue.</p>

      <p>Kruse is likely to make his anticipated season debut when Melbourne Victory visit the harbour city on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The Socceroo has missed Melbourne’s first five games due to a hamstring issue, but has been rushed back into a squad depleted by injury and players on international duty.</p>
      <p>It will be Kruse’s first A-League game since leaving the Victory in 2011.</p>
      <p>“Obviously he’s had a fantastic career overseas in Germany and a lot of success with the national team,” Wilkinson told AAP.</p>
      <blockquote>It’s great to have him back in the league. He’s obviously a dangerous player. He’s got a lot of pace, great skills. He could score goals but he could also assist goals and lay on that final pass.</blockquote>
      <p>“How fit he is, I don’t know. I don’t know how many games he’s played leading in.</p>
      <p>“He’s one we’re going to have to watch, but we’re not going to solely focus on him.</p>
      <p>“You pay your opposition respect, but mostly it’s about what we’re going to do and how we’re going to control the game.”</p>
      <p>Sky Blues coach Steve Corica confirmed defender Rhyan Grant will play just three days after punching out a full shift for the Socceroos in Jordan.</p>
      <p>Andrew Redmayne was also in Saudi Arabia but was unused and will be fresh, while Michael Zullo returns from injury for his season debut.</p>
      <p>The game also marks Sydney FC striker Kosta Barbarouses’ first against his former club.</p>
      <p>For the Victory, Kruse’s inclusion somewhat offsets a side without Andrew Nabbout, Storm Roux, Kenny Athiu, Thomas Deng, and Elvis Kambosa.</p>
      <p>The clash will be the first at Nestrata Jubilee Oval since the Sky Blues knocked Melbourne out at last year’s semi-finals with a record 6-1 rout.</p>
      <p>Half the ground was relaid when the Sky Blues trained there on Saturday.</p>
