      <h1>Bolton fire: Terrifying footage shows just how fast blaze spread in student block</h1>
      <h2>EXCLUSIVE A video shows just quick the fire spread to the top floor but Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue said the cladding is not the same as Grenfell</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T22:50:47+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 22:50</time> by <a rel="author">Phil Cardy, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/phil-cardy/</a></address>
      <p>Terrifying footage shows devastating flames rip through the fourth floor right up to the roof of a student accommodation block in a matter of minutes.</p>
      <p>The video taken by Ryan Pardon, exclusively obtained by the Sunday People, shows flames engulf the building which is home to 211 students.</p>
      <p>Ryan, who filmed the blaze from a neighbouring flat, started recording when the fire had taken hold on the fourth and fifth floors of six-storey Cube in Bolton.</p>
      <p>But within 90 seconds it had spread to top level - and a mere 40 seconds later they were through the roof.</p>
      <p>Alarms can be heard going off throughout the video, as Ryan and his friend speculate about the cladding used on the block of flats.</p>

      <p>Fire crews were examining the cladding - which was a central factor in the Grenfell disaster which claimed 72 lives in 2017.</p>
      <p>Eyewitness Ryan told the Sunday People: “The speed it spread was terrifying.</p>
      <p>"The cladding has to be looked at. My building has the same cladding, they’re only four metres apart, and we were worried the fire would spread.</p>
      <p>“It’s a miracle that no-one was seriously hurt or killed. I couldn’t sleep last night, my mind was racing about what could’ve happened.”</p>

      <p>He added: “I’ve been told I won’t be able to go home for two or three days. Every building needs to be tested to make sure the cladding is safe. It doesn’t matter about the cost.”</p>
      <p>More than 200 firefighters fought through the night to bring the blaze under control while students made their way to safety.</p>
      <p>Shocked witness spoke of flames “crawling up the cladding” with every floor of the six-storey building alight.</p>
      <p>Yesterday bosses at Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue said the cladding on The Cube was NOT the same as Grenfell - but is under investigation because the fire spread rapidly on the outside.</p>

      <p>Assistant chief Fire Officer Dave Keelan said lessons learnt from Grenfell helped with the evacuation.</p>
      <p>He said: “The procedures and subsequent training we have done since then has paid absolute dividends. The fire spread extremely quickly, that’s why I can’t praise the firefighters enough for initiating a full evacuation as soon as they got here.”</p>
      <p>The Fire Brigades Union condemned the “complete failure” of the UK’s fire safety system and said not enough had been done to make cladded buildings safer.</p>
      <p>General secretary Matt Wrack said: “It’s deeply troubling to see fire spread rapidly up a building’s exterior again - a shocking indictment of the government’s shameful inaction after Grenfell.”</p>

      <p>The fire broke out at 8.30pm on Friday in the privately-owned building which houses students at the University of Bolton. Witnesses spoke of flames “tearing up and across” the building.</p>
      <p>Student Melissa McGarrigle, 18, said: “Everyone thought it was just the fire alarms acting up as usual until we heard people screaming.”</p>
      <p>Onlooker Dominic Walsh, 36, said: “We could see the embers in the sky. We could see the building glowing at the top.”</p>
      <p>Paramedics treated two people at the scene for minor injuries, including one person rescued by fire crews from an aerial platform.</p>
      <p>Rescuers believe there are no casualties but are appealing for students to confirm they are safe and contact their parents to re-assure them.</p>
      <p>Action group Grenfell United said the fire “brings back memories”.</p>
