      <p>Karli White rebounded a saved shot by Western Washington teammate Makenzie Burks in the 81st minute, providing the game-winning goal for the top-seeded Vikings over No. 2 seed Seattle Pacific, 2-1, in the final of the Great Northwest Athletic Conference women’s soccer tournament at Interbay Stadium.</p>
      <p>White was named the tournament’s Most Valuable Player. She had two goals in the two matches, netting the opening goal in Thursday’s semifinal, and finished with 12 shots.</p>
      <p>The late goal was the turning point for another epic postseason meeting between the two teams, which met in the final for the fifth time in eight years. Both teams netted goals in the first half with Seattle Pacific freshman Chloe Gellhaus tallying in the 19th minute and Western Washington senior Jordyn Bartelson getting the equalizer in the 26th minute.</p>
      <p>With the win, Western Washington (18-2) earns the conference’s automatic berth to the NCAA Division II tournament. SPU (12-8) will hope for an at-large berth when the tournament field is announced Monday.</p>
