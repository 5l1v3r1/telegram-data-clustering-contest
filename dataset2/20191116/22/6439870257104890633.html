      <p>SAN DIEGO (AP) — A husband and wife and three of their young children died Saturday morning at the family’s San Diego home in what police believe was a murder-suicide sparked by a bitter divorce.</p>
      <p>Police Lt. Matt Dobbs told reporters that officers arrived at the home shortly before 7 a.m. Saturday following a 911 call from the residence in which a dispatcher heard someone being asked to leave. As they traveled there another call came from a neighbor saying they heard a sound coming from the home that sounded like a nail gun.</p>
      <p>Officers looked through a window and saw a small boy inside covered in blood. They broke into the house and found a 29-year-old woman, her 31-year-old husband and their 3-year-old son dead and three other boys, believed to be ages 5, 9, and 11 badly wounded.</p>
      <p>Two were pronounced dead at a hospital. The third was reported to be in very critical condition, Dobbs told an afternoon news conference.</p>
      <p>Police originally gave the surviving boy’s age as 11 but said later they could not be sure if that was correct.</p>
      <p>They sought to reassure the community they are not looking for a suspect.</p>
      <p>“It appears to be a tragic case of domestic violence,” Dobbs said, adding the woman had recently obtained a restraining order against her husband and the couple had been living apart for some time.</p>
      <p>“He used a handgun to shoot his family before turning the gun on himself,” the lieutenant said.</p>
      <p>Police Chief David Nisleit said officers had visited the home on Nov. 1 to resolve a property dispute between the couple and they advised the woman at that time on how to obtain a restraining order.</p>
      <p>“Best we know they were going through some type of divorce process,” he said.</p>

      <p>Neighbors told the <a href="https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/public-safety/story/2019-11-16/san-diego-police-investigating-paradise-hills-shooting">San Diego Union-Tribune</a> they often saw the boys outside playing with their dog or riding their bicycles.</p>
      <p>“They were just living the kid’s life on the outside, but who knows what goes on behind closed doors,” said neighbor Gabriel Durazo.</p>
      <p>Dobbs said the crime scene was so gruesome it traumatized even the arriving officers, who carried the children out of the house in a desperate effort to save them. He said counseling will be made available for any officers who need it.</p>
      <p>“My heart goes out to the family and their friends,” Nisleit said. “As a husband and a father this incident is very difficult for me to even think about.”</p>
