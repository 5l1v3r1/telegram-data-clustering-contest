      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T22:30:24+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matt-admin" target="_blank">Matt Lombardi</a></address>
      <p>We’ve got a scary situation near the end of the half during the Auburn vs. Georgia game. A young photographer on the sideline for the contest was knocked unconscious after being run into by a Bulldogs player.</p>
      <p>Georgia running back Brian Herrien, after gaining a few yards on a pass, was pushed out of bounds and collided with a school photographer for his team. The photographer was instantly knocked unconscious.</p>
      <p>It took a few minutes for her to regain consciousness. She was eventually carted off the field. It seemed like she was able to at least speak, but there’s no official report on her status.</p>
      <p>Footage of the collision is scary. It seems like she took a knee to the head at a minimum.</p>
      <p>You can check it out below:</p>

      <p>Hopefully the young woman winds up being okay. If so, she gave the college football world quite a scare. We’ll keep you updated on her status.</p>
      <p>As for the game, Georgia leads Auburn 14-0 at halftime. The Bulldogs were able to punch in a second score just before the half.</p>
