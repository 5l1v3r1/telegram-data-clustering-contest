      <p>Details of how accused Claremont serial killer, Bradley Edwards, once spoke of trying to suppress his anger have been revealed for the first time after state prosecutors won their bid to argue emotional upset in Edwards’ personal life triggered “violent, sexual or murderous” impulses.</p>
      <p>Edwards has pleaded not guilty to the murders of Sarah Spiers, 18, Jane Rimmer, 23, and Ciara Glennon, 27, who all disappeared from the Claremont entertainment strip in the mid-90s.</p>

      <p>Six years before Ms Spiers vanished, the then-Telecom technician was called to Hollywood Hospital to fix some equipment.</p>
      <p>While inside the hospital, the then 21-year-old approached a 40-year-old social worker who was working at her desk.</p>
      <p>He grabbed her from behind and forced a dishcloth into her mouth to stop her from screaming before attempting to drag her into a toilet block.</p>
      <p>The woman struggled and kicked Edwards, causing him to loosen his grip on her and she broke free.</p>
      <p>He was held by security and arrested shortly afterwards.</p>
      <p>In a court-ordered psychological report aimed at gaining an insight into Edwards’ reasons for carrying out the 1990 attack, he revealed how he typically tried to suppress his anger.</p>
      <p>Details of the report were made public for the first time on Friday after Justice Stephen Hall - the judge who will preside over Edwards’ murder trial – granted the state permission to lead with evidence claiming moments of emotional turmoil in Edwards’ life formed his motive for murder.</p>
      <p>“From his own admission, he tends to control his emotions and tries to suppress his anger, as he feels he has a bad temper,” the 1990 report read.</p>
      <p>“It appears that Mr Edwards had been in a state of some distress in the week leading up to the offence.</p>
      <p>“He explained during the first interview that he had argued with his de facto wife on an evening prior to the assault, and was still disturbed by this argument the following day.</p>
      <p>“Mr Edwards explained that he had also been carrying a heavier emotional burden from the previous week, when his de facto wife had informed him of her infidelity (with a previous boyfriend) earlier in their relationship.”</p>
      <p>Mr Edwards went on to explain to the psychologist he was in a state of emotional distress when he attacked the woman, and that he had apologised to her afterwards.</p>

      <p>“Mr Edwards is unable to clearly identify why his pent-up anger should be released when it did, or why he acted it out on his victim, a woman whom he had only met that day,” the report read.</p>
      <p>“He acknowledged feeling angry that ‘nothing was going right for me’ but suggested that he was not angry with his victim.”</p>
      <p>It is this state of emotional distress Edwards spoke of in 1990 that state prosecutors claim reveals a tendency for Edwards to attack women he doesn’t know when he is upset.</p>
      <p>This turmoil, they claim, occurred between late 1994 and March 1997, when his marriage to his first wife – who was his girlfriend in 1990 – deteriorated.</p>
      <p>During this same period, Edwards has admitted to the abduction and rape of a 17-year-old girl who was walking alone after a night with friends in Claremont in 1995.</p>
      <p>On the night Sarah Spiers disappeared in January 1996, the state alleges Edwards showed up unannounced at his first wife’s parents’ house after she moved out of their matrimonial home to ask if she would like to attend the Australia Day fireworks with him.</p>
      <p>She declined and according to her account to police after Edwards’ 2016 arrest, he showed no emotion to her rejection at the time.</p>
      <p>In the days leading up to Jane Rimmer’s murder in June 1996, the state alleges Edwards was told by his first wife that she was pregnant by a man she had been having an affair with.</p>
      <p>Again, she claims the news was met without any overt showing of emotion and recalls Edwards “just went quiet”.</p>

      <p>Around two weeks before Ciara Glennon was killed in March 1997, Mr Edwards and his first wife signed the papers to sell their matrimonial home. The state claims it was the first significant interaction Edwards had had with his first wife since she had given birth to her child in December 1996.</p>
      <p>Edwards’ defence team had argued the state’s emotional turmoil evidence should not be submitted at trial.</p>
      <p>“There is said to be no direct evidence capable of meaningfully measuring the nature or severity of the accused’s state of emotional upset (if any) at any relevant time,” their submission to Justice Hall read.</p>
      <p>“By the time [of Ciara Glennon’s murder] the accused’s marriage to [his first wife] was over ... In these circumstances, the defence submits that the signing of the contract for [the house] sale could not properly be characterised as an unsettling event.</p>
      <p>“In particular it is not an event of a sort that might act as a trigger for the commission, some 12 days later, of the apparently premeditated abduction and murder of Ciara Glennon.”</p>
      <p>Justice Hall has ruled it appropriate for the prosecution to lead its emotional upset evidence at trial on a provisional basis.</p>
      <p>He will rule what parts of the evidence are relevant after the state has finished presenting its case in court.</p>
      <p>Edwards’ judge-alone murder trial is due to commence on 25 November and run for around six months.</p>
