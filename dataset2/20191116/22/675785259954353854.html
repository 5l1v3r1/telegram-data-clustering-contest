      <h2>Joshua suffered his first defeat at the hands of the unfancied Ruiz Jr after being sent to the canvas three times before the bout was called off in round seven</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T22:29:50+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 22:29</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/evander-holyfield">Evander Holyfield</a> has warned <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/anthony-joshua">Anthony Joshua</a> he faces being knocked out again after claiming Andy Ruiz Jr's win over the Brit was no fluke.</p>
      <p>The pair are set to rematch on December 7 after <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/andy-ruiz-jr">Ruiz Jr</a> beat Joshua in the seventh round of their clash in June.</p>
      <p>Former heavweight champion Holyfield sparred with Ruiz Jr when the Mexican was just 19, and feels he is being completely underestimated again.</p>
      <p>Speaking exclusively to <a href="https://www.worldboxingnews.net/2019/11/16/exclusive-evander-holyfield-andy-ruiz-jr/">World Boxing News</a> , he said: "Andy Ruiz Jr really can fight. He has fast hands and can really hit hard. But don’t nobody seem to know it.</p>
      <p>"Everyone is thinking it’s a fluke (that he won the first time), but the guy showed he can get up from being knocked down. He got took down and got back up to win."</p>

      <p>He added: "You look at Ruiz and he doesn’t look like he can fight at all. Nothing tells you he can fight, but he can fight.</p>
      <p>“I knew that he could fight because I sparred with him. At the time, I was 46 and he was 19. I couldn’t believe a 19-year-old could be that good and so aggressive, he would chase me down.</p>
      <p>“I’m like, ‘I’m the heavyweight champion of the world, who’s he trying to chase down?’ It was just amazing the confidence that he had and the persistence to cut the ring down even in sparring.</p>

      <p>“So, I know that persistently, he will fight that same fight that he fought last time. If he’s [Joshua] not ready to have someone in his face in the whole fight then it could end up the same way again.”</p>
      <p>Joshua has been busy sparring a number of opponents in preparation for the bout in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.</p>
      <p>No. 4 ranked Brit Dereck Chisora is <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/boxing/anthony-joshuas-five-sparring-partners-20894414">one of five heavyweights</a> who have put Joshua through his paces in the lead up to the rematch, where he is bidding to regain the IBF, WBA and WBO world titles.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Ruiz Jr claims he will be coming into the bout significantly lighter than their last meeting, but dismissed any suggestions he has lost too much weight.</p>
      <p>"Right now, I'm only three pounds less than when I fought Anthony Joshua," Ruiz Jr told iFLTV.</p>
      <p>"A lot of people are saying 'he looks too skinny, he won't be strong enough for the fight', but those are people who don't really know about boxing.</p>
      <p>"I just want to be 6lbs, 8lbs lighter than I was on June 1.</p>
      <p>"That's the goal, to be 8lbs lighter, and that's going to make me feel a lot better.</p>
      <p>"It's going to make me a lot slicker, a lot faster, and that's going to tell on December 7."</p>
