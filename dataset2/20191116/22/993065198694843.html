      <p>Vinnie Jones has made it through another week on X Factor: Celebrity, and said the show was everything he needed since his wife died.</p>
      <p>Tanya Jones lost her long battle with cancer in the summer of 2019.</p>
      <p>The actor and former Wimbledon footballer offered emotional thanks to the show’s judges for the chance to perform.</p>

      <p>Reduced to a sing-off with Glee star Kevin McHale, Jones offered to remove himself from the show having gained the therapeutic benefits he wanted.</p>
      <p>He said: “I feel that I’ve had a fantastic time. I’ve really enjoyed.</p>
      <p>“It’s been everything I’ve needed “since my wife passed.”</p>
      <p>Jones added on McHale’s talent: “This guy is a real singer. For his career, I’d like to step down, Simon.”</p>
      <p>Cowell turned down his request, and cast the final vote to save the former footballer from exiting the show.</p>
      <p>He said he was “going to vote with my heart”, and decided to send McHale home.</p>

      <p>Jones took to the stage on X Factor: Celebrity with a medley of hits by The Clash.</p>
      <p>He was dressed in a black and white Union Jack suit as he sang on the ITV show.</p>
      <p>Judge Nicole Scherzinger said: “You’re so raw, you’re so rough around the edge . You’re a beautiful representative of a true Brit.”</p>
      <p>X Factor: Celebrity returns next Saturday at 7.40pm.</p>
