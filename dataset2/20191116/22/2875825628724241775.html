      <p>England manager Gareth Southgate insists Raheem ­Sterling hasn’t been damaged by his ­bust-up with Joe Gomez – and backed the Three Lions star to prove he is one of the best in Europe.</p>
      <p>Sterling will return to Southgate’s side for the final Euro qualifier against Kosovo in Pristina tonight after being left out of the squad that beat ­Montenegro 7-0 to clinch their place in the finals on Thursday night following a scrap with <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> defender Gomez.</p>
      <p>Southgate believes Sterling will not let the issue affect him.</p>
      <p>Southgate said: “Raheem will play against Kosovo – and he’s looking forward to it.</p>

      <p>“What has been suggested [about the fallout of the Sterling-Gomez row] is so far removed from seeing the team socialise and train together, that it’s incredible.</p>
      <p>“They are so tight. We’ve seen Raheem’s <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> posts regarding Joe, and I have also had a long chat with Raheem.</p>
      <p>“He’s looking forward to playing and, if anything, I think what has happened will only help to strengthen the bond between the players.</p>

      <p>“Raheem is 100 per cent an important player for us. He’s one of the best players in Europe.</p>
      <p>“I’m delighted for him that we have qualified because he now knows that he’s going to get the chance to play in a European Championship, where he can be one of the star players.”</p>
      <p>Sterling issued a full and frank apology to Gomez for grappling with the 22-year-old Liverpool star less than 24 hours after <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> were beaten 3-1 at Anfield.</p>
      <p>Sterling also took to social media to defend Gomez – who has been ruled out of today’s clash with a knee injury – from a fans’ backlash after he was booed when coming on as a substitute at Wembley.</p>
