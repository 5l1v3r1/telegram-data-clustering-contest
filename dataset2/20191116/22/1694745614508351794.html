      <h1>How Many Times Have I Watched This Dance to Summer Walker's "Stretch You Out"? Too Many</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T22:00:13+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 22:00</time> by <a rel="author">Danielle Jackson</a></address>
      <p>I have a certain respect for dancers, especially those who can effortlessly move in high heels. That — other than the fact that I'm a "retired" dancer myself — would likely explain why I've watched this choreography video set to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w98GE4kHJzM">Summer Walker's "Stretch You Out"</a> an absurd amount of times. The seven-minute clip features a group of dancers at LA's Playground dance studio showing off their skills to the sexy slow jam.</p>
      <p>Created by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ciscochoreography/">Cisco Ruelas</a>, the choreography features hair flips for days, along with a series of sultry movements, stretches, and level changes that I probably couldn't pull off even if I had all the control in the world. There's a small part of me that's tempted to move every piece of furniture in my living room to see if I <i>can</i> move as flawlessly as these dancers, but the sensible part is just going to continue watching the pros at work. Watch the full video above for yourself.</p>
