      <p>It wasn’t long ago that Nokia Mobile announced the Nokia 6.2 and Nokia 7.2, as well as attractive feature phones like the Nokia 2720 and 800 Tough. It was 2 months ago, and while it seems like yesterday, at least to me, that’s a relatively long period in the smartphone market and we might soon see something new.</p>
      <p>Three unknown Nokia phones under the model numbers TA-1205, TA-1212 and TA-1234 were certified by the Eurasian Economic Commission and approved for the Russian market. All three of them appeared yesterday, on 15th November, on EEC’s website, without any other meaningful details revealed.</p>
      <p>The recent speculations mentioned Nokia 5.2, Nokia 8.2 and Nokia 2.3. Considering we have been hearing about a 5.2 for quite some time, that model might’ve been cancelled. Nokia 8.2 is at the moment developed in 2 versions – a 4G and a 5G version. No one can guarantee that the 4G version will appear at all, but Nokia Mobile might push it out before the Christmas season. Some of the certified devices might also be feature phones.</p>
