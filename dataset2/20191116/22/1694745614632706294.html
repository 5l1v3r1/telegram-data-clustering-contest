      <p>A <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/How-Get-Drunk-Quickly-44275316">drunken night out</a> with friends often results in some truly hilarious quotes (if you can remember them), and Lili Reinhart wasn't afraid to share a few of her own during an interview on <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/The-Tonight-Show-Starring-Jimmy-Fallon"><b>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</b></a> on Thursday night. Reinhart — who was on the show to reflect on her time as Betty Cooper on the CW's <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Riverdale"><b>Riverdale</b></a> — started by recounting one of her first drunken nights out in LA when the show began. "I thought that I was being so philosophical, or saying all of these revolutionary things that I needed to remember," <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/lili-reinhart-talks-about-her-riverdale-and-hustlers-costars-46809774">she recalled.</a></p>
      <p>Fallon then went on to read some of her "not sober" thoughts, including, "If you have a pet goat and you didn't name in Billy, who the hell are you?" Watch the full video here to see what a drunken Reinhart has to say about "skeleton jigs," her role in <b>Hustlers</b>, <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/when-will-riverdale-season-4-be-on-netflix-46746891">graduating from Riverdale High</a>, and more.</p>
