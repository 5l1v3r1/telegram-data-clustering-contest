      <h1>Man Utd eyeing Matheus Pereira transfer as Sporting Lisbon star impresses on West Brom loan</h1>
      <h2>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's scouts have been impressed with Pereira's performances since coming to England and could</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T22:30:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United are keeping tabs on West Brom loan star Matheus Pereira.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old Sporting Lisbon winger has excelled at The Hawthorns this season and has become a firm favourite with Baggies fans.</p>
      <p>But his form has also caught the eye of several top-flight clubs with <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">United</a> among them.</p>
      <p>West Brom have an option to sign Pereira for £8.25million but that won’t put off other admirers.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian spent last season on loan in the Bundesliga with Nuremburg and the previous campaign with Portuguese side Chaves.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, United are plotting a £200million double swoop for Jadon Sancho and Erling Haaland in January.</p>

      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has identified the 19-year-old duo as his priority targets, with United ready to move swiftly when the window re-opens, to try to land them ahead of their rivals.</p>
      <p>Both are likely to cost United close to £200million, with Borussia Dortmund and England winger Sancho valued at £100m and RB Salzburg and Norway striker Haaland at £85m.</p>
      <p>Sancho is having a difficult time at Dortmund, with United alerted to his potential availability in January, rather than next summer, when they had planned to move for him.</p>

      <p>Despite a clutch of goals and assists already this season, Sancho was hauled off after just 36 minutes of Dortmund's recent clash with title rivals Bayern Munich.</p>
      <p>That came on the back of Sancho being fined by Dortmund for returning late from England duty following last month's international break.</p>
      <p>The feeling at United is there is an opportunity to take advantage of the discord between Sancho and Dortmund, with a January bid that could ultimately suit both parties.</p>
      <p>With Haaland, United hope his relationship with Solskjaer, who managed him at Molde, can give them a head start over their rivals in the race to sign Europe's most prolific young striker.</p>
      <p>Haaland, son of former City and Leeds midfielder Alf-Inge, has made an explosive start to the season, scoring 22 goals in 16 appearances, including seven in the Champions League.</p>
