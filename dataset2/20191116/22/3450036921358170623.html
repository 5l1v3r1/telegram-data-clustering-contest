      <h1>Monumental Day For Bulldog Football In 24-14 Win</h1>

      <p>URBANA, Ohio – Jordan Salima rushed for a career-high 216 yards in his final regular season game and the Truman Bulldogs won their ninth game for only the seventh time in program history, first since 1992. The Bulldogs won the non-conference game against Urbana 24-14 and will await word on possible postseason opportunities.</p>
      <p>Salima carried the ball 32 times and nearly seven yards per attempt on the chilly afternoon. He finished with his second 1,000-yard rushing season (1,028) and his 12th game of over 100-yards or more. Salima also climbed up the career attempts chart into second place with 808, passing Chad Guthrie.</p>
      <p>Scoring was at a premium in the first half.</p>
      <p>Josh Scheiderer connected on a 26-yard field goal with 1:02 left in the first quarter to put Truman up 3-0 capping off 14-play, 70-yard drive.</p>
      <p>Jordan Siegel got into the act in his "game 44". Siegel picked off Izzy Sanders in the endzone with 5:47 left in the half. It was Siegel's fourth career interception.</p>
      <p>The Bulldogs turned the turnover into points with Jaden Barr connecting with fellow senior Monty Sharpe II for a 34-yard touchdown pass and a 10-0 lead right before half.</p>
      <p>Scheiderer hit from 39-yards on Truman's first possession of the second half to make it 13-0.</p>
      <p>Urbana got on the board later in the quarter when Sanders found Jesse Bray for a 42-yard passing touchdown to close the gap to 13-7.</p>
      <p>Sam Reeves' final career sack set up Truman's next score. Reeves and senior Jake Floyd teamed up to bring down Sanders on fourth and four early in the fourth quarter and Truman promptly used Salima seven times before he powered into the endzone to make it 21-7. It was 40.5 sacks for Reeves, which will rank in the top 10 of all Division II football.</p>
      <p>Senior Eric Yakle got into the act in the next Blue Knights possession. Yakle brought down Sanders for a sack and loss of six yards on fourth down at the Bulldog 44 and Schiederer again put it between the uprights from 30 yards out and a 24-7 lead.</p>
      <p>The Blue Knights got a late TD from Bray on a 25-yard reception but Truman recovered the onsides kick to seal the victory.</p>
      <p>Truman had nearly 38 minutes of possession time and gained 397 yards. Barr was 11-of-21 for 111 yards and became the all-time leader in career total offense with 9,076 yards passing Eric Howe's total of 9,040.</p>
      <p>Senior Travis Myerson led the defense in tackles with eight while Urbana gained 380 yards total.</p>
      <p>In winning their ninth game, Truman eclipsed 400 points for only the second time in school history. The Bulldogs scored 409 points, just shy of the 1982 record of 415.</p>
      <p>Truman will await word on any possible postseason opportunities. The NCAA will announce the Division II playoff field on Sunday, which Truman was not ranked in the latest regional poll, but could be invited to one of the five Division II bowl games played on December 7th.</p>
