      <p>Jeremy Loghman was awesome while Munster began the Champions Cup with a crucial bonus point win away to Ospreys.</p>
      <p>Ex-Leinster man Jeremy Loughman scored the only try in the first half at Liberty Stadium.</p>
      <p>Keith Earls and Andrew Conway added a couple of tries after the break and James Cronin scored the bonus point effort.</p>
      <p>Munster were 13-6 in front at half-time but it could have been more after a brilliant opening half from the visitors.</p>
      <p>Tyler Bleyendaal was inspirational but it was Ospreys out-half Luke Price who scored first, from a eighth minute penalty after Munster strayed offside.</p>
      <p>But Munster stepped it up a notch at the end of the first half with a couple of relentless drives towards the Ospreys line. The latter saw Loughman emerge at the end of the move to touch down a deserved try in the 34th minute.</p>
      <p>Munster’s second try came from a lineout when Tommy O’Donnell got through down the blindside.</p>
      <p>Loughman almost scored his second try but Earls scored when the ball was recycled.</p>
      <p>That score came in the 50th minute and two minutes later Conway raced clear down the right wing after Loughman was involved in the build-up again.</p>
