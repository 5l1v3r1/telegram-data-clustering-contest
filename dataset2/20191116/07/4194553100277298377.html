      <h1>‘Disappointing to see’: Van Dijk sticks up for his Reds teammate Gomez after Sterling row</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T07:26:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 07:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/mattaddison/" target="_blank">Matt Addison</a></address>
      <p>The fallout from Raheem Sterling and Joe Gomez’s bust-up in England training has continued with Virgil van Dijk asked about the situation while away on international duty with the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>The Dutchman was on the field when Sterling and Gomez clashed at Anfield in the Reds’ crucial victory in the Premier League title race, but since then, the pair clashed again in England training, with Gareth Southgate dropping Sterling for the win over Montenegro.</p>
      <p>When Gomez came on in that game, though, many Reds fans were furious to see that he was booed by some inside Wembley Stadium – despite being the innocent party in all this.</p>
      <p>Sterling caused a big scratch down Gomez’s face and by all accounts was the one in the wrong – and Van Dijk, as expected, has spoken up for him, telling everyone to leave him alone.</p>
      <blockquote>🗣 | Virgil van Dijk: “Everybody needs to move on [from the Sterling/Gomez situation] and leave Joe especially alone.” ❤️<a href="https://t.co/P67kHolGmE">pic.twitter.com/P67kHolGmE<br/></a>— Steven Gerrard (@Gerrard8FanPage) <a href="https://twitter.com/Gerrard8FanPage/status/1195435951339773955?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 15, 2019</a></blockquote>
      <p>After international duty, Gomez and Van Dijk could line up together as the Reds face Crystal Palace. Sterling and Gomez won’t face off again until the beginning of April, though there will have been another international break by then.</p>
