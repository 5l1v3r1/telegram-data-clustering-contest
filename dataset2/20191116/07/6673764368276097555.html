      <p><b>SPRINGFIELD, MASSACHUSETTS – </b>Bill Russell finally accepted his Basketball Hall of Fame ring.</p>
      <p>The 11-time NBA champion, five-time MVP, Olympic gold medalist and two-time NCAA champ said on Twitter on Friday that he was presented with his Hall of Fame ring in a private ceremony.</p>
      <p>The 85-year-old Boston Celtics great didn’t attend the induction ceremony in 1975. He said he didn’t deserve to be the first black player inducted, tweeting: “I felt others before me should have that honor.”</p>
      <p>His tweet mentions Chuck Cooper, who in 1950 was the first African-American player drafted by the NBA and who was posthumously inducted this year.</p>
      <p>Russell said the ceremony was attended by his wife, along with close friends and Hall of Famers Bill Walton, Ann Meyers and Alonzo Mourning.</p>
