            <b>JOZ vs NMG Dream11, Probable Playing 11, Toss, Pitch And Match Report: Agonising Jozi Stars find themselves slumped in the trenches of the league standings with the three wins in succession.</b>
          </p>
          <p>When you have ended up losing all three of your encounters in the league, questions are raised over the team composition to start with as the layers lining up the unit are taken a long hard look at. Unfortunately for Jozi Stars, there is no such predicament with the team being assembled with a solid sprinkling of worldclass players, something which only increases the exasperation over the team’s displays in the ongoing edition of the Mzansi Super League.</p>
          <p>Playing in the second edition of the marquee South African T20 league, what has emerged as the biggest food for thought for the side is the way they have faltered in their batting displays. The top-order is one capable of pummelling the best bowling unit in the world but the shambolic collapses have seen the side completely fail to cover themselves in glory.</p>

              <anchor name="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146">
                <p>The side fell apart against Cape Town Blitz in their last encounter, falling to a calamitous 57 run defeat as the team lost their way in pursuit of the 184 run target dished out infront of them. The 126 they managed to muster up was agonising, leaving the side slumped in last place, a position which they need to wrench out of to the earliest.</p>
                <p>Things are hardly going to get easier for them today though when they got at loggerheads against Nelson Mandela Giants, a side who recorded a win in their league opener to find themselves in third place. They defeated today’s opponents only in the last outing, a  17 run win as they defended the 163 runs put up by their bats with ease against Jozi Stars.</p>

                      <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                      <p>One of the finest tracks in the country, this is an exquisite and exuberant surface for the batsmen. The ball comes on sublimely onto the bat, allowing the batters to crunch the ball to the short square boundaries with the team winning the toss ascertained to come out and bat first.</p>

                            <h3>JOZ vs NMG Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>Heino Kuhn from Nelson Mandela Giants is our pick in the wicket-keeping department in our Dream 11 side. The player scored 47 runs in the side’s only encounter of the league, a solid knock which sees us earmark him for this docket.</p>
                            <h3>JOZ vs NMG Dream11 Batsmen</h3>
                            <p>He finds company in Ben Dunk while from the opposition we begin with their opener Chris Gayle. The West Indian has endured a horrid outing in the three matches he’s stepped out in but today’s surface is one which is completely devoid of anything for the bowlers. This is the ideal wicket for Gayle to rediscover his free flowing touch to see us keep him in our setup.</p>
                            <p>Reeza Hendricks’ 155 runs in three matches have seen him resonate the same enigmatic and euphoria filled displays from the previous campaign also comes in from the side along with Temba Bavuma who has managed to amass 133 runs in the same time.</p>
                            <h3>JOZ vs NMG Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>Scoring 48 runs against Jozi Stars the last time around sees us immediately move in for Farhan Behardien form Nelson Mandela Giants with Chris Morris being his partner for this one after returning with the three wickets till now. Simon Harmer becomes our only option from the other side of the docket with the player having snagged four wickets in three matches till now.</p>
                            <h3>JOZ vs NMG Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>On a track where the bowlers are going to have a tepid time, Imran Tahir’s legspin could be just what Nelson Mandela Giants need to curtail the opposition. The player is bound to be deployed early on against Gayle who has completely collapsed infront of spin, a narrative which could see him return with an early wicket in this one.</p>
                            <p>The three wickets for Junior Dala will also be our choice for the day from the side while from the other side we are wrapping up our unit with Kagiso Rabada.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>We have selected Hendricks to captain our side for the day whilst Kuhn will be our vice-captain.</p>
