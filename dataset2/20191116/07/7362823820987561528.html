      <h1>Kin to Michael Brown, Marine deserter accused of killing mom's boyfriend: 'Please, turn yourself in'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T07:14:43+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 07:14</time> by <a rel="author">Brie Stimson</a></address>
      <p>The mother and grandmother of Michael Brown, a decorated <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military/marines">U.S. Marine</a> now <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/manhunt">on the run</a> after <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/homicide">allegedly killing</a> his mother’s boyfriend in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/virginia">Virginia,</a> pleaded with him Friday to turn himself in.</p>
      <p>“Please trust us when we tell you to trust the authorities and turn yourself in,” his grandmother, Diane Hanson, told Roanoke's WFXR-TV.</p>
      <p>Brown, 22, allegedly deserted his post at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/north-carolina">North Carolina</a> last month after he was accused in the shooting death of Rodney Brown on Nov. 9.</p>

      <p>On Friday, authorities in North Roanoke cleared a search area after investigating a report of a possible sighting of Brown walking along train tracks. But authorities said they could not confirm Brown was in the area, <a href="https://www.wsls.com/news/local/2019/11/15/man-with-rifle-reportedly-spotted-in-northeast-roanoke/">WSLS-TV of Roanoke reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Also on Friday, the U.S. Marine Corps confirmed that Brown was considered a deserter, <a href="https://www.nbc12.com/2019/11/16/marine-corps-lists-va-murder-suspect-deserter/">WDBJ-TV of Roanoke reported</a>. A Marine Corps spokesman told the station Brown did not show up for duties Oct. 24, was listed as AWOL the next day, and was declared a deserter Nov. 10, the day after Rodney Brown was killed.</p>

      <p>“I don’t want you hurt, please,” his mother, Vanessa Hanson, said.  “Michael you’re my baby I love you please I can’t lose you. I’m scared for you.”</p>
      <p>Brown’s car was found in South Carolina last week, authorities said Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Several agencies in North Carolina and Virginia -- in addition to the U.S. Marshals, FBI, and Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) have been conducting a massive manhunt for him.</p>

      <p>His mother went on to say they would help him get a lawyer if he turned himself in.</p>
      <p>“I can’t lose another person,” she added.</p>

      <p>“Michael I know that you’re alone and afraid right now but there are people who want to help you," his grandmother told <a href="https://www.wfxrtv.com/news/breaking-news/exclusive-interview-with-the-mother-grandmother-of-michael-brown/">WFXR</a>. "We still care about you. Please turn yourself in. Nobody wants to see you die also."</p>
      <p>The Franklin County Sheriff’s Office in Virginia Monday issued a warrant for Brown’s arrest on second-degree murder charges.</p>
      <p>Authorities were still working to determine a motive. Neighbors told <a href="https://www.wsls.com/news/2019/11/11/neighbors-marine-murdered-man-he-grew-up-believing-was-his-father/">WSLS</a> the Marine recently learned Rodney Brown was not his biological father. He reportedly believed his mother’s boyfriend was his biological father for his entire life.</p>
      <p>Authorities said Brown should be considered “armed and dangerous.”</p>
