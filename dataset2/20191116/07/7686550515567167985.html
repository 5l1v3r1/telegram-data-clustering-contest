      <h1>Christmas 2019 is almost here and the question is: To shop or not to shop?</h1>
      <h2>Casting consumerism aside and opting for a handmade Christmas is all very 'woke' but...</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T07:30:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 07:30</time> by <a rel="author">Lynne Barrett-Lee</a></address>
      <p>Is it too early to talk about Christmas? Yes, rationally, because it’s only the 16th of November, which means it’s still less than 11 months since we trekked up to our respective attics and put away the last bits of last Christmas.</p>
      <p>But the point at which it becomes a ‘thing’ in our individual psyches is nothing to do with the calendar. No, it obviously depends on our particular location on this season’s festive stressometer.</p>
      <p>I should be way down this year. Proper bumping along the bottom. We’re spending Christmas in the Cotswolds, with Luke, Rex and Charlotte (which, hilariously, makes us sound like a right bunch of toffs) and, as Charlotte will by that time be 40 weeks pregnant, we’re just going to go with the flow - at least two of us might be spending it on a labour ward, after all.</p>
      <p>Which means, right now, in November, I have reasons to be jolly. To float along, moreover (which is the point of this column) on a plump cloud of unexpected virtue. Heck, given all the consuming I will be conspicuously NOT engaged in, I’m probably in line for a halo. Because saving the planet is what it’s all about, right?</p>
      <p>Which is something I’m fully up for, as regular readers know. I was at an ‘Eco-friendly, Sustainable, Community Christmas’ fayre recently, which as well as being a lot to fit onto a flyer, contained nothing that wasn’t pre-loved or home-made or crafted, all out of stuff people already owned.</p>
      <p>Which meant it energised my long-dormant PTA gene and inspired me to do what was once parental (not to mention fiscal) second nature - not buy in, but hand-make most of Christmas. To create all we need from the resources all around us, from the foliage in our garden (holly, ivy, all the staples), to the brown paper packaging that CAN go in the compost, to the raw materials (some half dozen huge boxes of Christmases past) up in the aforementioned loft, ready for repurposing. To not, in short, buy a single bauble.</p>
      <p>So far, so inspiring, so (tedious new term alert) ‘woke’.</p>
      <p>But I had somehow forgotten one salient point. That this week marks the advent of the Christmas-themed advert, as much of a tradition in our lives now as turkey. Suddenly, I cannot turn on the television - and that’s at any time of the day and night - without finding myself being exhorted to spend. To buy a new Christmas jumper. To express love through ‘gifting’. To lay on feasts so increasingly decadent and calorific that it makes the ‘prawn spoon’, once the very acme of sophistication (apparently), seem as exciting as a plate of bread and dripping.</p>
      <p>To make my home twinkle. To create a festive ‘tablescape’ (eh?). To bag a ‘delivered in time for Christmas!’ Christmas sofa. To respectfully observe the solemn nature of our most important religious festival. No, silly, not Yuletide. Black Friday.</p>
      <p>This is capitalism. How the world works. Or, increasingly, might not be. So I’m right to step away from it, aren’t I? Jeez - let’s get some planetary perspective!</p>
      <p>But one advert in particular gave me unexpected pause for thought. From the ‘high street’ (so presumably a retailers’ collective), it implores us to do our Christmas spending there. You might have seen it - various shopkeepers, victims of the wicked, wicked internet, warbling entreaties to us consumers to come and save them.</p>
      <p>And why wouldn’t they? Have you seen your local high street lately? Answer no, and you’re part of the problem. It was certainly a short hop to see ME as the problem, because I so rarely shop in town anymore. And though past Christmases have at least seen a ‘shopping day’ enshrined in the festive calendar (okay, fair play, ‘short shop, epic lunch day’, more accurately) I haven’t done that in five years now.</p>
      <p>So what of the poor shop-keepers? I spy Dickens’ A Christmas Carol. All those shop workers, freezing, in fingerless gloves, near penniless, no heating, no turkey for Tiny Tim. All because of that wicked, wicked internet.</p>
      <p>But it’s not much of a leap, then, given my consumption-free credentials, to start worrying about the staff there, as well. To find myself in the company of an internet retailer’s distribution centre worker, who, with less and less seasonal tat to distribute (I’m making my crackers out of newspaper and old loo rolls, remember) sees their zero hours contract set at zero. So it’ll be off to the soup kitchen for them too.</p>
      <p>Ditto everyone whose livelihood depends on Christmas spending. Because when the last fairylight goes out on the last retailer’s Christmas grotto (real or virtual), who is going to care about them?</p>
      <p>I’m overthinking this, obviously. The world adapts, obviously. But in the meantime, it’s back to merry stressmas.</p>
