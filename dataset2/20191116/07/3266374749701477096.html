      <h1>Transfer News: Manchester United plotting staggering £200 million double January move for Erling Haaland and Jadon Sancho</h1>

      <h3>Manchester United are reportedly lining up a mammoth £200 million double January swoop to strengthen attack by landing Jadon Sancho and Erling Haaland.</h3>
      <p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-utd-line-up-200m-20889527">Daily Mirror</a>, Manchester United are plotting a staggering mega-money double move for the January transfer window. The Premier League heavyweights are lining up a swoop for Jadon Sancho and Erling Haaland, in a ploy that could set them back by around £200 million.</p>
      <p>Jadon Sancho and Erling Haaland are two of the brightest spots in European football at the present moment. Haaland is enjoying a breakthrough campaign with Red Bull Salzburg and is making a name for himself as a goal machine, having already netted five hat-tricks this season.</p>

      <p>Sancho, on the other hand, is slowly starting to become a proven quantity as one of the best creative forces in Europe. For a second season running, the 19-year-old’s numbers make for an impressive reading, with 4 goals and 8 assists in 16 outings till date. And, the teenage duo’s exploits have earned them an admirer in Manchester United.</p>
      <p>Attack has been the Achilles heel for Manchester United this season, both on creative and finishing fronts. Apart from Paul Pogba, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer does not have reliable options to consistently deliver in build-up play, with regular forwards Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Daniel James more proficient for their directness.</p>
      <p>Andreas Pereira, who has been a regular this season, has flattered to deceive in the final third. And so, <a href="http://www.thehardtackle.com/news/2019/10/29/transfer-news-manchester-united-prepared-to-shell-out-100-million-to-land-jadon-sancho">Manchester United have had the need to pursue Sancho</a>, who could boost Solskjaer’s creative options considerably and take some burden off Pogba, when the Frenchman is back.</p>
      <p>As far as goalscoring is concerned, Solskjaer often has to look upon just Rashford and Martial, with the others only contributing on the odd occasion. Haaland is, thus, a viable target for Manchester United, who are <a href="http://www.thehardtackle.com/news/2019/11/15/transfer-news-manchester-united-lead-barcelona-in-erling-haaland-pursuit/">reportedly regarded as the front-runners in the race to sign him</a>.</p>

      <p>As far as Sancho is concerned, the original plan was for Manchester United to make a move for him next summer. But, things have changed in recent weeks, with reports suggesting that a January exit could be on the horizon, in the wake of the player being hauled off just 36 minutes into the first <i>Der Klassiker </i>of the season.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.thehardtackle.com/news/2019/09/03/transfer-news-manchester-united-target-jadon-sancho-opens-door-to-england-return">Sancho has already said that he is open to returning to England</a> and amid a brewing crisis at Borussia Dortmund, Manchester United are sensing an opportunity to sign him, as per the report. Daily Mirror suggest that a double move could cost United around £200 million, with Haaland valued at £85 million, while Sancho has a £100 million price tag.</p>
      <p>In order to tempt Salzburg to sell Haaland, Manchester United are also considering the option to loan him back after signing him in January, much like Christian Pulisic’s move to Chelsea. As far as Sancho is concerned, a permanent move could be in the offing. But, it remains to be seen if a mega-money double swoop for the two highly sought-after teenagers can see the light of the day.</p>
