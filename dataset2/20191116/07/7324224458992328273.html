      <h1>West Brom's Grady Diangana no surprise for Darnell Furlong</h1>
      <h2>Grady Diangana's impressive form for Albion has come as no surprise to team-mate Darnell Furlong.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T07:00:38+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/joseph-masi/" target="_blank">Joseph Masi</a></address>
      <p>The winger, who is currently away with England’s under-21s, has registered four goals and five assists for the Baggies since joining on loan from West Ham.</p>
      <p>Furlong first became aware of Diangana’s talent while he was at QPR with the defender taking on the Hammers in a pre-season friendly.</p>
      <p>And he admits Diangana was a player who immediately caught his eye.</p>
      <p>“Not really,” Furlong said when asked if Diangana’s form had surprised him this season.</p>
      <p>“There was a game at QPR in pre-season where we played West Ham, he played second half I played first half. I remember watching him in that second half thinking, ‘wow this kid’s sharp and really effective’.</p>
      <p>“That was all I really knew about him. But since he’s come in he’s been on fire, he’s a real problem for full-backs.</p>
      <p>“He’s really hard to deal with even in training.</p>
      <p>“I get to watch him every day and analyse him but for someone coming up against him on a single day it must be tough.”</p>
      <p>Furlong believes Diangana deserves credit for the way he has made himself a first-team regular at The Hawthorns.</p>
      <p>“He deserves credit for solidifying his place,” the defender continued.</p>
      <p>“He came in and was on the bench, coming off. There was a game I wasn’t involved in where he came off the bench against Luton to score to get us a good result.</p>
      <p>“Since then he’s taken off and will continue to do so.”</p>
      <p>Able to play on both the right and left wing, Diangana’s ability to go both ways has meant opposing full-backs have found it hard to stop him this season.</p>
      <p>But Furlong believes it’s his athleticism that makes him so effective.</p>
      <p>“He can go down the outside or come inside – that’s definitely hard to deal with,” Furlong added.</p>
      <p>“But overall, it’s his genetics. He’s a very good athlete, it’s hard to keep up with someone like that. And he’s a really nice kid who just wants to learn and work hard, he a credit to himself.”</p>
