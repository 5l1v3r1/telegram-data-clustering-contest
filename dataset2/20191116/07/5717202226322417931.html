      <h1>Eriksen to leave? 3 attacking midfielders who should be on Tottenham’s January wishlist</h1>
      <h2>Christian Eriksen’s contract is winding down.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T07:45:19+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 07:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/jay-williams/" target="_blank">Jay Williams</a></address>
      <p>It is no secret that Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Christian Eriksen is likely to leave in the near future.</p>
      <p>Whether that is in January or next summer remains to be seen. But Tottenham should try to sell the Denmark midfielder when the window opens in the new year.</p>
      <p>Eriksen’s presence in the squad is potentially unsettling his team-mates given the extensive media coverage surrounding his future. His form has dipped and Spurs will want to avoid losing him for nothing.</p>
      <p>If Tottenham do cash in this January, here are three potential replacements who need to be considered.</p>
      <h3>Bruno Fernandes</h3>

      <p>Spurs should have sold Eriksen and signed Fernandes when they had the chance in the summer. This can be fixed if Daniel Levy delivers the Sporting CP midfielder in January.</p>
      <p>With nine goals and six assists in 17 games this season, the Portugal international is a constant threat. The 25-year-old could provide the spark that has been missing for Spurs this season.</p>
      <h3>James Maddison</h3>

      <p>Silky playmaker Maddison is thriving at Leicester City. With six goals and two assists this season, the England midfielder has lifted Leicester City to second in the league.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Spurs are languishing in the bottom half and Eriksen is just not producing his magic. Maddison, 22, operates in a similar central role, picking passes, scoring goals and providing a threat with his set-piece deliveries.</p>
      <h3>Hakim Ziyech</h3>

      <p><a href="https://www.90min.com/posts/6494749-exclusive-spurs-consider-move-for-hakim-ziyech-as-christian-eriksen-replacement">According to 90min</a>, Ziyech is Tottenham’s number one target to replace Eriksen in January. If Levy could bring the Ajax and Morocco star to North London this winter, it would be a potentially season-changing signing.</p>
      <p>Ziyech is the ideal candidate to take over from Eriksen with his natural talent on the ball. The 26-year-old has six goals and 15 assists in 21 games this season, proving why he is so highly sought-after.</p>
