      <p>ONE of the largest indigenous groups of Sabah, the Murut people is made up of 29 sub-ethnic groups, including the Tagol, Timugon, Paluan, Nabaai, Kolor, Serudong, Bokan and Tangala.</p>
      <p>The name “Murut” means “hill people”. </p>
      <p>A large percentage of the Murut communities reside in the southwest interior of Sabah, in the districts of Keningau, Tenom, Nabawan, and Pensiangan, along the Sapulut and Padas rivers.</p>
      <p>The last indigenous group of Sabah to renounce headhunting, the Murut were known as the silent headhunters and called “pengait”, or the hook.</p>
      <p>Up until the 1960s, they beheaded their foes and collected the heads as trophies. – November 16, 2019.</p>
