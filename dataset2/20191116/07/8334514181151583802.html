      <p>BELGRADE (Reuters) - Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic has been admitted to a hospital after experiencing heart problems, his office said on Saturday.</p>
      <p>A government official who spoke on condition of anonymity told Reuters on Saturday: “The president is stable now.”</p>
      <p>Vucic, 49, was admitted to a military hospital in Belgrade due to cardiovascular problems on Friday, a statement from his office said.</p>
      <p>A former ultra-nationalist who turned towards the European Union, Vucic became prime minister in 2014 and was elected president in 2017.</p>
      <p>Although the presidential role is ceremonial he retains political control as head of the Serbian Progressive Party, which has been in power since 2012.</p>
