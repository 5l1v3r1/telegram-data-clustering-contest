      <h1>Christmas Toy Appeal is picking up pace - but we still need more help!</h1>
      <h2>There's only four weeks left to donate to the Advertiser's annual appeal.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T07:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Leona Greenan, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/leona-greenan/</a></address>
      <p>The Advertiser’s festive toy appeal is picking up pace with dozens of donations already handed in.</p>
      <p>But in order to give the county’s disadvantaged children a Christmas to remember, we need even more help!</p>
      <p>And with little over five weeks to Christmas Day, there is just under four weeks left to hand in your Advertiser toy appeal donations.</p>
      <p>Our deadline this year is Tuesday, December 10, in order to sort and distribute the gifts for the disadvantaged children of Lanarkshire by the end of that week.</p>
      <p>This will ensure that South Lanarkshire Council’s social work services team can get the toys to the families prior to their shutdown on December 20, and in time for Christmas Day.</p>
      <p>Advertiser reporter Leona Greenan, who coordinates the appeal, said: “With your help, we can all really make this a Christmas to remember for the children that the appeal supports.</p>
      <p>“Anyone who would like to make a donation can do so by handing it in to The Salvation Army on Burnblea Street, Hamilton, weekdays between 10am and noon; Happy Feet Nursery, Claude Street in Larkhall, daily from 9am to 5pm; or Starbucks Hamilton, Palace Grounds Retail Park, from 9am to 8pm.</p>
      <p>“We are also happy to announce that we have further support from restaurant Rocca, on Cadzow Street, Hamilton, as another drop-off point for toys and gifts. They are happy to accept your goods between 9am and 9pm, seven days a week.”</p>
      <p>Anyone who would still like to support the appeal can do so by purchasing a brand new gift, toy, gift voucher or clothing for a child aged between newborn and 18. Examples of items are prams, dolls, character sets, toy cars, make-up, fragrance, jewellery, games, Lego, footballs or outdoor toys – no matter the monetary value.</p>
      <p>The goodies will then be sorted by age range and gender and collected by South Lanarkshire Council’s social workers.</p>
      <p>They will then distribute the parcels to the needy children across Hamilton, Blantyre, Larkhall, Bothwell, Uddingston, Lanark and Carluke.</p>
      <p>For further information on the appeal, please contact Advertiser reporter Leona Greenan at leona.greenan@reachplc.com or call her on 01698 205179.</p>
