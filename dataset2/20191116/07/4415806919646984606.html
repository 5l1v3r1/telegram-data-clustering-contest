      <p>The countdown to a General Election and four byelections top the agenda for the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in Derry this weekend.</p>
      <p>Brexit, Irish Unity and a general election in the UK are also in the spotlight.</p>
      <p>The party has outlined 166 motions to debate solutions for critical issues facing citizens across the island of Ireland.</p>
      <p>Sinn Féin says this Ard Fheis comes at a critical time for the country - with the 26 counties on election countdown, byelections on November 29, a Westminster election next month and Brexit looming on the horizon.</p>
      <p>More than 2,000 members have registered to attend across the weekend, with Party Leader Mary Lou McDonald's keynote speech this evening.</p>
      <p>A fringe meeting will also take place this afternoon to discuss the economic merits of a United Ireland with Seamus McGuinness, the Professor of Economic Research at the ESRI.</p>
      <p>Along with Brexit and Irish Unity, the Ard Fheis is also debating issues such as the cost of insurance, the cost of childcare, sky-high rents and the need to deliver a large-scale public housing programme.</p>
