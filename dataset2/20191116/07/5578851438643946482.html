        <b>Supporters of a hardline Islamist party on Friday blocked highways across the country in an effort to pressure Prime Minister Imran Khan to resign, accusing him of bad governance.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Members of the JUI (F) (Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazlur Rehman) party held the sit-in protest in the Hub area outside Karachi, organized by regional leader Rashid Soomro, which immediately brought the traffic to a halt.</p>
      <p>Hub is the border city between Sindh and Balochistan, connecting Karachi to southern Balochistan via the RCD highway.</p>
      <p>â€œWe believe that our mandates and votes were snatched away from us in the general elections held on July 25, 2018, and a bogus government was imposed on us in the results of fraudulent elections. We have gathered here with our demands that new and fresh elections should be held in the country with immediate resignation of current leadership, Rashid Somroo, General Secretary, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam party.</p>
      <p>Passenger buses and transport trucks were also stranded in the traffic which compelled passengers to walk while carrying their belongings.</p>
      <p>Protesters vowed to continue with their action until their demands were met.</p>
