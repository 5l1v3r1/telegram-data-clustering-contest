      <p>Paris - France international flyhalf <b>Jules Plisson</b> has joined La Rochelle from Stade Francais, the two clubs announced on Friday.</p>
      <p>Plisson, 28, who has played 19 times for France but last appeared for his country in 2018, will join La Rochelle "with immediate effect".</p>
      <p>He had fallen out of favour at Stade Francais under South African coach <b>Heyneke Meyer</b>, who quit this week after the Paris club's poor start to the season continued with a 27-11 defeat to Brive in the European Challenge Cup.</p>
      <p>Stade Francais said Plisson "has left himself the option to return to the club in the future."</p>
      <p>La Rochelle are ninth in Top 14 with four wins and five defeats this season.</p>
