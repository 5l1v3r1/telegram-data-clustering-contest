      <p>DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- A search for a stabbing suspect was underway Friday night after a taxi driver was found dead in the parking lot of a Burger King in downtown Los Angeles.<br/><br/>The incident was reported shortly after 6 p.m. near the intersection of Grand and Cesar Chavez avenues, according to the Los Angeles Police Department. The call originated as a back-up call from fire officials who found the victim with a crowd forming around.<br/><br/>The driver suffered a "major trauma" after being stabbed in the facial area following some kind of dispute with the suspect, police said.<br/><br/>Witnesses say the driver, described as an elderly man, pulled into the parking lot with a passenger. Both of them then exited the car.<br/><br/>"The man razzled him down, I guess in an attempt to rob him or something, and stabbed him right in his neck," April Adams said.<br/><br/>Authorities were looking into surveillance footage from surrounding cameras, including inside the taxi.<br/><br/>Authorities described the suspect as a bearded man wearing a black zip-up sweater and pants.<br/><br/>A motive for the stabbing was under investigation.</p>
