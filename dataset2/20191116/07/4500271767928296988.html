      <p>KARACHI: The country’s external debts and liabilities increased by $543 million in the first quarter of this fiscal year while external debt servicing soared to over $3 billion.</p>
      <p>As per quarterly data released by the State Bank of Pakistan on Friday, the country’s external debts and liabilities rose to $106.891bn by September end, as compared to $106.348bn on Jun 30.</p>
      <p>Though the external debts and liabilities have increased during the quarter, its percentage with respect to gross domestic product has significantly declined.</p>
      <p>According to the publication, external debts and liabilities as percentage of GDP fell to 38.3 per cent as of Sept 30, versus 45pc on June 30.</p>
      <p>The debts and liabilities recorded a jump of $10.78bn from $96.11bn in end of September 2018.</p>
      <p>The country had to borrow on large scale during the year to meet the huge gap of about $20bn current account deficit which was reduced to $12bn which the government is trying to down to $7bn by FY20 end.</p>
      <p>Due to the high external debts and liabilities stocks, its servicing surged to a massive $3.074bn in the first quarter of this fiscal year. This represented a year-on-year increase of 25.36pc from $2.452bn in 1QFY19.</p>
      <p>The debt servicing amount comprises of long-term principal repayment worth $1.87bn, short-term $402m and total interest of $798m.</p>
      <p>If the quarterly debt servicing maintains its quarterly trend and magnitude, overall FY20 figure could be around $12bn, which well exceeds the SBP reserves of $8.3bn.</p>
      <p>The government can use only SBP foreign currency holdings to meet expenditures like debt servicing, which was recorded at $11.589bn in FY19.</p>
      <p>To contain the current account deficit and improve foreign exchange reserves, the government introduced import curbs which gave it some relief on the external front.</p>
      <p>However, the same strategy has adversely impacted economic growth as decline in imports have hurt business activity in the activity.</p>
      <p>Due to the government’s halt on borrowing from the central bank, most loans have been channelled towards short-term treasury papers and the longer duration investment bonds, which have noticed a healthy demand due to the high key policy rate of 13.25pc.</p>
      <p>The recent annual report of SBP on economy also suggested that activity witnessed negative impact of lower imports.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, data on central government’s domestic debt reveals an increase of Rs1.92 trillion over the quarter to Rs22.65tr as of Sept 30, from June end level of Rs20.73tr.</p>
      <p>Market treasury bills were the leading contributor, as Rs1.028tr worth of short-term securities were issued on a net basis, taking their stock by September end to Rs5.958tr, up from Rs4.93tr in previous quarter.</p>
      <p>Rest came from the Pakistan Investment Bonds which were added by Rs907bn, taking their total value to Rs11.84tr by the end of 1QFY20, as compared to Rs10.933tr on June 30.</p>
