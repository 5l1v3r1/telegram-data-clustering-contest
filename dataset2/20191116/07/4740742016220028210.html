      <h1>‘Kids throw digestives at overweight people’: Welcome to the most antisocial street in Bristol</h1>
      <h2>One shopkeeper says he has made 600 calls to police in just six months</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T07:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Conor Gogarty</a></address>
      <p>Yobs are reportedly terrorising a Knowle West street by hurling racist abuse, launching fireworks at police and lobbing digestive biscuits at shoppers.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/knowle">Newquay Road</a> saw more antisocial behaviour in September than any other street in Bristol, with 12 reports according to the Avon and Somerset <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/avon-and-somerset-constabulary">police</a> crime map.</p>
      <p>Premier convenience store owner Henry* says he has made 600 calls to police in the last six months because of “horrible” youths causing trouble outside the Newquay Road shop, though police say they only have a record of 30 calls from him.</p>
      <p>The 48-year-old estimates he has lost 25 per cent of his business in recent months because of yobs as young as 10 swearing at customers and throwing biscuits at them in mockery of their weight.</p>
      <p>He says is not aware of a single <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/crime">prosecution</a> and has accused police of failing the community.</p>
      <h3>‘Nightmare’</h3>
      <p>Henry said: “This nightmare has been going on for six months. I have been at this shop since 2001, and I always had a good relationship with the young ones before the last six months.</p>
      <p>“You get up to 20 of them outside the shop from the end of school-time until 10.30pm when we close each day.</p>

      <p>“If you have all those kids outside, do you think anyone will want to come in? They pressure customers to get them bottles of Coke. Of course the customers say no, then the kids swear and abuse them.</p>
      <p>“They throw digestives on the road so seagulls swoop down and cause chaos for the traffic. They think it’s funny. They are not afraid of anything.”</p>
      <p>Henry believes some of his customers are scared to visit the shop because they have been pelted with biscuits.</p>
      <p>“The kids throw digestives at overweight people,” he said. “They make personal insults about these people.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes they racially abuse me. They swear at me. You can’t do anything.”</p>
      <p>The shopkeeper says he often sees the youths throwing eggs at passing cars and flattening the tyres of parked vehicles.</p>
      <p>He added: “Over the last six months, it has become a place where kids come from Filwood, <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/hengrove">Hengrove</a> and all over to gather and cause trouble.</p>
      <p>“I have spoken to some of their parents. Mummy says ‘I will do something’ then drops them here again the next day. I was thinking, ‘Eh?’”</p>
      <p>Henry claims a boy aged around 17 ran into the shop and snatched a bottle of Coke on November 4.</p>
      <p>He said: “I gave the police my CCTV footage of this and they just said, ‘We don’t know who it is.’</p>
      <p>“This boy is outside my shop every other day. He keeps coming back to laugh at me.”</p>
      <h3>'They don't say a word'</h3>
      <p>Henry feels the police have done nothing to address the community’s fears about the youths.</p>
      <p>He said: “The only police presence is from PCSOs, who are so scared of the kids, they don’t say a word to them and just walk past.</p>
      <p>“If you call the police, they come, they watch the kids gathered outside and they go. They don’t do anything.”</p>

      <p>A <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-council">Bristol City Council</a> CCTV camera is perched metres away from the shop, which has left Henry puzzled over the lack of action taken on antisocial behaviour.</p>
      <p>Henry added: “I asked one officer why they do not do anything with the footage, and his excuse was: ‘The camera is not that good.’”</p>
      <p>“I told him he should do something about it and speak to the council.”</p>
      <p>The shop owner says police have issued 48-hour dispersal orders three times in the last six months, banning groups from gathering by the shop – but claims these were ignored by youths and not enforced by police.</p>
      <p>The area outside the shop was strewn with cigarette packets, fast food packaging and other litter when <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-live">Bristol Live</a> visited. Henry said the youths were responsible for this.</p>

      <p>Newquay Road is mainly a residential road of red-brick semi-detached houses. A mum-of-three who lives in a home near the Premier shop told <i>Bristol Live</i> about her experience of the “vile” yobs.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old, who did not wish to give her name, said: “I hear them until 11pm in the night banging on shop shutters, fighting each other, throwing fireworks down the road. It’s disgusting.</p>
      <p>“The PCSOs can’t do anything. The kids drive past on mopeds doing wheelies and take the mickey out of the PCSOs.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been here four years. I’m from Bath originally, so it’s been quite a reality check for me.”</p>
      <p>Another man who lives nearby claimed on one occasion in June police were called because youths were throwing biscuits at people.</p>
      <p>The resident, in his 40s, said: "When the police came, the youths chased the police car down the road, throwing biscuits at them. They drove away and didn't come back."</p>
      <h3>‘A poor reflection’</h3>

      <p>Newquay Road is home to the Eagle House community centre, where dozens of older Knowle West residents were socialising when we visited on a Wednesday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Around 15 men were enjoying pints in one room, while in the next a similar number of women played bingo.</p>
      <p>Despite being glad for a place to meet and talk, the common frustration for those in the centre was that it did not offer a similar facility for youngsters in the area.</p>
      <p>The building next door housed a youth club until around four years ago, when it closed due to council cuts.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Though most did not wish to be named for fear of reprisal, several people at Eagle House told <i>Bristol Live</i> they believe boredom and a lack of local activities is responsible for the antisocial behaviour.</p>
      <p>One 61-year-old man said his wife saw teenagers launching fireworks at police cars on Bonfire Night.</p>
      <p>Another man, aged 70, claimed he regularly sees 13 and 14-year-olds using cannabis by the shops.</p>
      <p>He added: “I’ve never felt intimidated, but kids on the street smoking a bit of the old Bob Marley is a poor reflection on the area.”</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old bartender in Eagle House revealed the neighbourhood’s problems have left her fearing for her six-year-old daughter’s future.</p>
      <p>She said: “I have lived in Knowle my whole life. When I was growing up, it was better.</p>
      <p>“Because of the youth club, we always had somewhere to go, and we knew if we behaved ourselves there would be a trip to look forward to at the weekend.</p>
      <p>“For the kids on the street, it’s the only place for them to go. They are constantly doing wheelies on scrambler bikes.</p>
      <p>“I can understand why it would worry older people. They come here from other areas because they know it winds up the people who live here.”</p>
      <h3>'It's frustrating'</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Anita Pearce, who was among the women playing bingo, lived in Newquay Road as a child and has dedicated her life to making Knowle West a better place.</p>
      <p>The 65-year-old, who worked in community development for the council, says man of the initiatives she helped run have since lost their funding.</p>
      <p>She added: “We used to have kids cleaning up outside the youth club, and helping older people get rid of their rubbish. That scheme stopped about 10 years ago.</p>
      <p>“I set up Knowle West Against Drugs in 1994, which was a group of mums fighting the drug problem in the area.</p>
      <p>“We did fact-finding missions, talking to prisoners and things like that so we could educate ourselves and help addicts. Now it’s merged with other groups because of funding cuts.</p>
      <p>“It’s frustrating to think what the residents and the community did to make Knowle a nicer place for their families. Without resources, it’s hard to keep those standards going.”</p>
      <p>She also pointed to Government cuts to police as a factor in the area’s recent crime problems.</p>
      <p>Her friend Pat Filer, 73, added: “I have grandchildren here and I want the best for them. The problem is the kids on drugs destroy the atmosphere around here.</p>
      <p>“People are frightened to come out. One woman at our local meeting with police this week said she was too scared to go to the shop after 5pm.”</p>
      <h3>Who is helping young people?</h3>
      <p>Battling the perception that there are no local youth activities is Knowle West Media Centre on Leinster Avenue, a 15-minute walk from Newquay Road.</p>
      <p>The charity’s director Carolyn Hassan said the centre has engaged with more than 250 youngsters in the last six months, many of whom attend every week.</p>
      <p>She added: “Each week during term time Knowle West Media Centre delivers three free evening sessions for young people with an interest in media, technology and the arts.</p>
      <p>“We also offer free half term and summer activities. However, we have waiting lists for all of these activities and, like other organisations, do not have enough resources to cater to the demand.</p>
      <p>"The area needs more street-based youth workers to build positive relationships with young people, and more support for locally based organisations to expand their existing work so it reaches all age groups and addresses a broad range of interests.”</p>
      <p>Ms Hassan also praised the youth support offered in the area by Streetspace, Youth Moves, Filwood Community Centre, The Park and Re:work.</p>
      <h3>What police say</h3>

      <p>An <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/avon-and-somerset-constabulary">Avon and Somerset police</a> spokesman said: "Newquay Road is a current priority for us and has featured as a priority tasking for the past six to eight weeks.</p>
      <p>"We are aware of the concerns of residents and businesses who have reported significant problems with anti-social behaviour.</p>
      <p>"However we do struggle to get people to provide information and intelligence who exactly is causing the problems in order to take positive action.</p>
      <p>"We have increased patrols in the area and continue to work with our partners such as youth services to try to provide targeted work with these young people."</p>
      <p>He added that officers have recently met with resident representatives to discuss "how the community could help in tackling some of this behaviour".</p>
      <h3>What the council says</h3>
      <p>A Bristol City Council spokesman said: “Bristol City Council is one of only a handful of local authorities in England that directly funds youth services in the city.</p>
      <p>"A £9million contract over three years is delivering targeted support for children and young people in the areas of the city in most need. This money is also being used by Quartet to provide small grants for projects looking to provide services for 8 to 19-year-olds and develop a stronger play sector.</p>
      <p>“Bristol’s youth offer is much wider that just council funded services with many organisations like sports clubs, theatre groups and scout associations offering activities across the city.</p>
      <p>"Groups like Jump Studios in Knowle West Media Centre on Leinster Avenue are examples of the excellent work being carried out to offer options for local young people.”</p>
