      <h1>Man, 87, recalls the time a massive tornado hit New Hanover - in 1948</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T07:29:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 07:29</time> by <a rel="author">Kamva Somdyala and Sharlene Rood</a></address>
      <p>When a tornado struck in New Hanover, KwaZulu-Natal, on Tuesday and wreaked havoc on the small town, it brought back memories for 87-year-old Valentin Volker of similar scenes more than 70 years ago.</p>
      <p>Then a 16-year-old pupil in Wartburg, Volker told News24 it was an afternoon in April when they noticed the tornado forming in New Hanover, which is north of Pietermaritzburg.</p>
      <p>"What I remember is that a classmate of mine's home was completely destroyed by the tornado," he said. "Then, surrounding communities banded together to help build a new home for the family," Volker recalled.</p>
      <p>When the most recent one hit the area – 71 years later – "it struck a memory … when these things happen, it revives things that happened in the past". "It's something that doesn't happen regularly in the country," Volker said.</p>
      <p>The extent of the damage caused by the tornado is yet to be determined, but the provincial government has said it could run into the millions.</p>

        <b>'There were no tiles on the roof'</b>
      </p>
      <p>On Tuesday, the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs activated councillors and volunteers to assist affected communities.</p>
      <p>A statement issued by municipality spokesperson Mandla Nsele on Wednesday warned: "Severe thunderstorms accompanied by heavy downpours are expected over most parts of KwaZulu-Natal from Thursday into Friday afternoon.</p>
      <p>"Improvement is expected from Friday evening, however, there will still be some rain in places over KwaZulu-Natal."</p>
      <p>Thuleyliwe Ndlovu, a mother of three, lost her 40-year-old daughter Sphe Ndlovu. She was distraught on Wednesday as rescue teams and officials arrived in the ravaged community.</p>
      <p>Ndlovu said there had been heavy winds and rain, which forced them to take shelter.</p>
      <p>"We ran into the house and closed the door. After we closed the door, I went to the bedroom to look for a jersey. While I was looking for the jersey, I heard the roof tiles making a huge noise. When I looked up, there were no tiles on the roof."</p>
      <p>She said a concrete block had fallen on top of her daughter.</p>
      <p>"I couldn't move the blocks because they were heavy. I tried and tried until the neighbours came to help me."</p>
