      <h1>Jon Gosselin Says Kate Wanted Legal Custody Of Their 8 Children Just To Remain Relevant!</h1>

      <p>During a new interview on Dr. Oz, Jon Gosselin made some shocking claims about his former wife, including the fact that he was the one who paid for her legal fees when they divorced, which amounted to no less than $1.7 million!</p>
      <p>However, what really grabbed everyone’s attention was when he claimed that she wanted to have legal custody of the kids just to remain relevant.</p>
      <p>You probably know that Kate and Jon had their own reality TV show called Jon and Kate Plus 8, which documented their crazy life raising 8 kids!</p>
      <p>Even though it was a successful show, Jon decided to walk away from it back in 2009 but, as it turns out, it was not an easy task!</p>
      <p>‘I literally hung a note on my gate saying if any crew members show up, I’ll have you arrested. [TLC] sued me for breach of contract,’ the man shared on Dr. Oz.</p>
      <p>In 2010, the reality TV show became a series of specials titled Kate Plus 8, which were all about her life as a single mom of 8 after the divorce from Jon.</p>
      <p>It all came to an end, however, when Jon’s lawyers issued a cease and desist which meant that the TLC cameras could no longer shoot at their family house.</p>
      <p>Now that Kate has her own show all about her dating life, Jon is convinced that all she cares about is fame.</p>
      <p>‘So, I financed [my divorce] by myself and she was financed by the network. I did not understand at first why, but now I understand — all she wanted was legal custody of the kids to sustain her lifestyle and lifestyle. And it gets all warped. That is fame though, it just twists things around,’ Jon shared his opinion.</p>
      <p>Do you think he is right about that or not?</p>
