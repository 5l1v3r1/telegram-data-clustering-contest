      <p>Aston Villa midfielder Marvelous Nakamba has revealed he doesn’t get surprised by Douglas Luiz’s eye for a cracking goal – because he always scores them in training.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian has found the net twice for Villa since his summer move from Manchester City and both strikes – first against Bournemouth and then against Norwich City – have been crackers from distance.</p>
      <p>His capability from range now frequently draws cries of ‘shoot!’ from the crowd when he picks the ball up in space.</p>

      <p>The star’s ability wows supporters on a weekend, but Nakamba has grown used to see him impress in training.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.avfc.co.uk/AVTV/2019/11/15/Interview--Marvelous-Nakamba">Speaking to the club’s official website</a>, he said: “He scores really really fantastic goals. Now it’s normal because sometimes even in training he always scores those fantastic goals.</p>
      <p>“He’s a really, really good player and also a good guy with good character.”</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – Villa’s secret weapon</h3>
      <p>Luiz’s superb ball-striking from distance is a real weapon for Villa.</p>

      <p>Sometimes when opponents sit in it can be hard to break them down with passing.</p>
      <p>So the fact that Luiz possesses such a powerful shot is good for the team in that, they can pass it to him to try his luck if they are struggling to create chances.</p>
