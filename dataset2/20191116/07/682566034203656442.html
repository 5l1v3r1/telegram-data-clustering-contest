      <p>Pristina - <b>Gareth Southgate</b> is set to bring <b>Raheem Sterling</b> back from his brief England exile in Sunday's Euro 2020 qualifier against Kosovo as he seeks to end the controversy over the Manchester City star's row with Joe Gomez.</p>
      <p>Sterling was dropped for Thursday's 7-0 rout of Montenegro after clashing with England team-mate Gomez in the Three Lions' training base canteen.</p>
      <p>It is believed Sterling was unhappy with Gomez following an altercation with the Liverpool defender during City's Premier League defeat at Anfield last weekend.</p>
      <p>Although Sterling was left out of the Montenegro game as punishment for his attack on Gomez, Southgate has confirmed the winger will return for England's final Group A fixture.</p>
      <p>Sterling and Gomez, left with a scratch under his eye after the incident, are said to have patched up their relationship, but the centre-back was jeered by England fans at Wembley when he came on as a substitute against Montenegro.</p>
      <p>Both Southgate and Sterling expressed their support for Gomez and criticised the booing supporters, with the England manager reportedly comforting the shocked 22-year-old and his family after the match.</p>
      <p>Now Southgate could include Gomez against Kosovo in a show of support for the Liverpool player.</p>
      <p>With England already guaranteed to qualify for Euro 2020 in first place in their group, Southgate already planned to make changes, although he is keen to ensure England finish with a win as they eye a top-six seeding in next year's tournament.</p>
      <p>"We will make some changes, for sure, but the seeding in the group could be critical and we know it's a big night for the Kosovans," Southgate said.</p>
      <p>"It's a shame for them that they're now out of this part of the qualification, although they've still got the play-offs in which I think they'll be a huge threat in that format.</p>
      <p>"So, it will be a good test for us because it will still be a lively environment.</p>
      <p>"The enthusiasm for the game is high and we want to finish the group with as many points as we can."</p>
      <p>Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson could return following a one-match ban, while Southgate has to decide whether to keep faith with Ben Chilwell ahead of Danny Rose at left-back.</p>
      <p>Harry Kane may have scored a hat-trick against Montenegro but it was Leicester's Chilwell who was named England's man of the match following a fine display in which he provided three assists in the opening 24 minutes.</p>
      <p>"Ben, I liked the hunger in his game, the enthusiasm to get forward," Southgate said.</p>
      <p>"The whole team pressed well but he also pressed well from that full-back position, got into overlaps, his quality of delivery was excellent."</p>
      <p>Although England have cruised through their qualifying group, Southgate believes the 2018 World Cup semi-finalists still have room for improvement as they chase a first major title since 1966.</p>
      <p>"There were a couple of chances we conceded that just shouldn't happen, so that's still part of our game that we've got to improve upon," he said.</p>
      <p>"If we are to be a team that are going to challenge seriously, although we're young, we've got to manage games well.</p>
      <p>"We've got to make sure that, although we're such a fantastic attacking threat, the rest of the team is right as well. There are things we've got to be better at."</p>
