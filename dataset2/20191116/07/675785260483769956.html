      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T07:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Finding wonderkids is what makes Football Manager such a challenge.</p>
      <p>Anyone can sign the world's best player - if they're interested in your club, that is - with an unlimited budget, but unearthing the next best thing for a bargain price and transforming him into Lionel Messi is what it's all about.</p>
      <p>We've been getting to grips with Football Manager's latest installment for 2020 and have found a smattering of wonderkids all over the globe.</p>
      <p>We've also found a healthy amount in the Premier League, but for your convenience have whittled the number down to just 10 of the very best.</p>
      <p>You'll have likely heard of most of these names, but they fit the wonderkid category given their age - and they just might revolutionise your side.</p>
      <h3>Mason Greenwood</h3>

      <p><b>Club:</b> Manchester United</p>
      <p><b>Position:</b> Forward</p>
      <p><b>Age:</b> 18</p>
      <p>Greenwood needs little introduction, despite his young age and the fact you'd expect him to be lost in the academy at this point in his career.</p>
      <p>He's proven he knows where the back of the net is in the real world, and on the game he has the potential to turn into it's best forward.</p>
      <h3>Troy Parrott</h3>

      <p><b>Club:</b> Tottenham</p>
      <p><b>Position:</b> <b/> Forward</p>
      <p><b>Age:</b> 17</p>
      <p>Spurs supporters will know all about this young striker, who was recently called up to the Ireland national team.</p>
      <p>In the game his stats are modest to begin with, but after a few seasons he'll be up there with the very best.</p>
      <h3>Eddie Nketiah</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20716983.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Leeds-United-v-Brentford-Sky-Bet-Championship.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <p><b>Club:</b> Arsenal</p>
      <p><b>Position:</b> Forward</p>
      <p><b>Age:</b> 20</p>
      <p>Currently on loan at Leeds, Nketiah is a proven goal scorer, but at 20 he's one of the older players on this list.</p>
      <p>Due to being older, and the fact he plays for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a>, he has a bigger profile and will therefore be harder to sign. But it's worth the try.</p>
      <h3>Phil Foden</h3>

      <p><b>Club:</b> Manchester City</p>
      <p><b>Position:</b> Midfielder</p>
      <p><b>Age:</b> 19</p>
      <p>Foden is both well known and has won silverware in the real world, meaning he'll be very difficult to sign on the game.</p>
      <p>If you can though, he'll transform into one of its best midfielders - perhaps even its best.</p>
      <h3>Hannibal Mejbri</h3>

      <p><b>Club:</b> Manchester United</p>
      <p><b>Position:</b> Midfielder</p>
      <p><b>Age:</b> 16</p>
      <p>He plays for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a>, but you may not have heard of this 16-year-old.</p>
      <p>According to Football Manager, you will in the next few years, as the game has tipped the teenager to turn into a world-beater.</p>
      <h3>Harvey Elliott</h3>

      <p><b>Club:</b> Liverpool</p>
      <p><b>Position:</b> Midfielder</p>
      <p><b>Age:</b> 16</p>
      <p>Elliott is already remarkably well known for a 16-year-old, having represented both <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fulham-fc">Fulham</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a>.</p>
      <p>Reds fans have enjoyed watching the youngster in action in cup competitions this season, and you'll no doubt enjoy watching him flourish into your team's best player on FM.</p>
      <h3>Bukayo Saka</h3>

      <p><b>Club:</b> Arsenal</p>
      <p><b>Position:</b> Forward</p>
      <p><b>Age:</b> 18</p>
      <p>Another player who needs little introduction is Saka, who has burst onto the scene at Arsenal this season.</p>
      <p>He'll cost a bomb, and the Gunners won't want to sell him, but he has some serious potential on the game.</p>
      <h3>Matteo Guendouzi</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20738839.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_BESTPIX-Arsenal-FC-v-Crystal-Palace-Premier-League.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Matteo Guendouzi is the most experienced player on the list (Image: Getty Images)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><b>Club:</b> Arsenal</p>
      <p><b>Position:</b> Midfielder</p>
      <p><b>Age:</b> 20</p>
      <p>The player with the most Premier League experience on the list, and another man Arsenal will not want to part company with.</p>
      <p>The good thing about Guendouzi, given how much football he has played at such a young age, is that you'll know exactly what he'll bring to your team from studying him in the real world.</p>
      <h3>Max Aarons</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20872517.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Bristol-City-v-Norwich-City-Sky-Bet-Championship.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Max Aarons is top-drawer on Football Manager 2020 (Image: Getty Images)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><b>Club:</b> Norwich</p>
      <p><b>Position:</b> Defender</p>
      <p><b>Age:</b> 19</p>
      <p>London-born full-back Aarons doesn't play for a Big Six team - the shock.</p>
      <p>But he's absolutely top drawer on Football Manager and a player you need to think about signing, especially as it's doable.</p>
      <h3>Gavin Bazunu</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article13360293.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Shamrock-Rovers-v-AIK-Europa-League-Qualifying-Round-One-First-Leg-Tallaght-Stadium.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <p><b>Club:</b> Manchester City</p>
      <p><b>Position:</b> Goalkeeper</p>
      <p><b>Age:</b> 17</p>
      <p>He plays for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a>, but you may not have heard of him.</p>
      <p>City view the young Irish keeper as one for the future, so it might be a challenge trying to sign him. But if you can, he has the ability to stand between your sticks for the next 20 years!</p>
