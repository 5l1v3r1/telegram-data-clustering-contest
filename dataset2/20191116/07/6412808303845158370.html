      <h4>A female ride-hailing driver in Palembang, South Sumatra is as serious about her safety as she is about supporting her family.<br/>The working mother has installed an iron cage to shield herself as she drives passengers around the capital city of the Indonesian province.</h4>

      <h4>According to her, she decided to take a somewhat extreme measure to safety after multiple instances of crime against taxi drivers last year</h4>
      <p>"In 2018, there were five incidents involving taxi drivers," the female driver told the Indonesian man who was interviewing her in the cab for a video story.<br/><br/>"Some were robbed and killed, so anticipating something similar might happen to me and because as a mother I fear more than just my life, I've taken this step."<br/><br/>She explained that in order to get the iron cage installed in her cab, she went to a welding workshop and had the welder there design this cage to fit her comfortably.</p>

      <h4>She revealed that she had to spend IDR700,000 (RM210)</h4>
      <p>However, the cage still has some finishing touches left to it.<br/><br/>"I want it to be covered with acrylic glass," she can be heard saying in the video.<br/><br/>Acrylic glass is a transparent thermoplastic often used in sheet form as a lightweight or shatter-resistant alternative to glass. It is often used in windows for submarines.</p>
      <h4>Meanwhile, the video interview has gone viral</h4>
