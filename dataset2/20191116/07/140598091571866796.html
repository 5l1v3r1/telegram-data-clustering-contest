      <h1>BBC embroiled in 'misogyny' row as drag performers criticise RuPaul's Drag Race over 'offensive' language  </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T07:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/jessica-carpani/" target="_blank">Jessica Carpani</a></address>
      <p>The BBC is at the centre of a "misogyny" row over its new drag queen reality show which highlights "unacceptable" language about women.</p>
      <p>RuPaul's Drag Race UK has been accused of using crude phrases to "ridicule" women, while LGBTQ+ artists added the programme failed to represent the full spectrum of British drag.</p>
      <p>The show sees drag queen contestants compete against one another in performance-related challenges such as singing, acting and comedy.</p>
      <p>The UK version aired on BBC Three for the first time last month following its successful 10-year run in the US.  A second series was commissioned by the BBC last week after recording positive audience figures. </p>
      <p>However, the show's language has attracted criticism from fellow drag performers and LGBTQ+ activists.</p>
      <p>Author and playwright Rose Collis said derogatory terms used in relation to the female anatomy were "pure misogyny".</p>
      <p>The BBC rejected the show was misogynistic, insisting it was instead "empowering" for its audience.</p>
      <p>Ms Collis told the Telegraph: "It seems to be acceptable still for women’s anatomies and women in general to be ridiculed. This is on BBC television and that is staggering. </p>
      <p>"I’m a woman and whether I watch it or not, I don’t want my license fee money going towards something that uses misogynistic terms about women and about women’s bodies.</p>
      <p>"The BBC has total responsibility."</p>
      <p>During a discussion about the show on BBC's Woman's Hour, artist Victoria Sin said : “A lot of drag is really misogynistic in a really unacceptable way. </p>
      <p>"We should definitely challenge drag queens and platforms that are promoting misogynist drag.” </p>
      <p>A BBC spokesperson said: “RuPaul’s Drag Race is an award winning show and is widely recognised as inclusive, celebratory and empowering. </p>
      <p>"Applications to be on the show are open to everyone and the UK version is proving to be a huge hit with young audiences on BBC Three.” </p>
