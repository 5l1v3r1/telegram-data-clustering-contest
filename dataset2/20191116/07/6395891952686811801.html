      <p><b>WELLINGTON, New ZealandÂ (AP)</b> - Former Washington Wizards guard Glen Rice Jr. has been arrested in Auckland after an altercation in a bar, 10 days after joining the New Zealand Breakers in Australia's National Basketball League.</p>
      <p>Breakers chief executive Matt Walsh confirmed Walsh was arrested Thursday morning.</p>
      <p>"Glen alerted us to an incident the other night that he was out and got into a scuffle with some guys," Walsh told Television New Zealand. "He told us and we're aware of it. We're trying to get information.</p>
      <p>"Like anyone on the team we'll give him the benefit of the doubt, innocent until proven guilty."</p>
      <p>Rice, who joined the Breakers as an injury replacement for fellow American Brian Hopson, remains with the team and is expected to play their next game against Perth on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old is the son of three-time NBA All Star Glen Rice.</p>
      <p>He attended Georgia Tech but was dismissed by coach Brian Gregory in 2012 after multiple suspensions, the last involving a shooting outside an Atlanta nightclub.</p>
      <p>Rice was taken by the Philadelphia 76ers as the 35th pick in the 2013 draft but later traded to Washington. He was waived by the Wizards in January 2015.</p>
