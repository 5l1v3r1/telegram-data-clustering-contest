      <p>Evan Fournier landed two late three-pointers as his 26-point haul led the Orlando Magic to a 111-109 NBA win over the San Antonio Spurs.</p>
      <p>Australian guard Patty Mills' 13 points in 19 minutes could not save the Spurs, who led by 16 in the first half before Orlando regrouped.</p>
      <p>The contest was tied at 104 apiece after a DeMar DeRozan lay-up with one minute and 32 seconds to play, before Fournier nailed his second key three-pointer to condemn the Spurs to a fourth-straight loss.</p>

      <p>Mills' compatriot Ben Simmons' 16 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists were also in vain as the Oklahoma City Thunder ended a two-game losing streak with a 127-119 overtime victory over the Philadelphia 76ers.</p>

      <p>Solomon Hill stripped Utah's Donovan Mitchell just before time expired to seal it as Memphis recorded their third straight win.</p>
