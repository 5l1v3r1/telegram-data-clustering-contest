      <h1>Newcastle to make loan offer for Arsenal outcast Granit Xhaka – report</h1>
      <h2>Newcastle United are ready to rescue Granit Xhaka from his nightmare situation at Arsenal, according to a report</h2>

      <h3>Newcastle United are ready to make a loan offer to sign Arsenal outcast Granit Xhaka in the January transfer window, according to a report in England.</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/14/newcastle-interested-signing-wantaway-arsenal-star-granit-xhaka/">The Telegraph</a> is reporting that Newcastle manager Steve Bruce believes he can convince Xhaka to consider a move to St James’ Park when the transfer window opens.</p>
      <p>The same article states that the Magpies would have to see off interest from Serie A giants AC Milan as Bruce looks to improve Newcastle’s options in the middle of the park.</p>
      <p>According to the same story, the Italian club are currently the favourites to sign the former Arsenal captain in January following Xhaka’s demise at the north London side.</p>
      <p>The <i>Telegraph</i> report goes on to add that the Newcastle manager is convinced Xhaka would improve his team despite the Swiss midfielder’s inconsistent form at Arsenal.</p>
      <p>Xhaka hasn’t featured for Arsenal since the defensive midfielders outburst at supporters following his substitution in a 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace last month.</p>
      <p>Arsenal manager Unai Emery made the decision to strip Xhaka of the captaincy despite appointing the Swiss midfielder as Laurent Koscielny’s replacement earlier this season.</p>
      <p>Xhaka moved to Arsenal in a £33m deal from Bundesliga side Borussia Monchengladbach in 2015.</p>
      <p>The Arsenal star has netted 11 times in 143 games in all competitions.</p>
