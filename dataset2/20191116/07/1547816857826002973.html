Milap sets out to do a Salim-Javed. Tara Sutaria plays a damsel in distress aka the wronged lover or sister of the 80s. Nora Fatehi struts around in a remix and you can go out for a few yawns and have a cup of tea. If and when you come back, nothing much would have changed. Suddenly, a thought might race in your head. Why is Milap synonym with cheap dialogues? Sample this: The height of hope is defecating on the sands and hoping that the waves will give you a wash. Imagine hearing this in Hindi! There is at least one more when it comes to the several others on heights, you see Riteish Deshmukh plays a dwarf longing for height"<br/><br/><br/><i>Images Source: instagram/sidmalhotra</i></p>
