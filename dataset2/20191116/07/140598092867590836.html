      <h1>Fun in the city: 10 of the best family-friendly hotels in Brussels</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T07:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/a/antony-mason/" target="_blank">Antony Mason</a></address>
      <p>Belgium as a nation is very family-oriented, and most of the best and most interesting hotels in Brussels are family-friendly: why (they might respond to the question) would they not be? This is witnessed first and foremost in the flexible accommodation offered; and breakfasts are almost always buffet-style, with a full gamut of choice. Some of these are top-end luxury hotels; others (such as Meininger Hotel Brussels City Center and the Train Hostel) are closer to hostels, but innovative, entertaining and attractively priced with it. Here's our pick of the best family-friendly hotels in Brussels.</p>

      <p>Exotic travel is the theme at this hotel, which makes staying in it a special experience. A wonderland lies behind the rather plain façade: you’ll find unique, theatrical décor and great value for money, close to Rue Antoine Dansaert and the Grand Place. Each room is designed in the style of a different nation or destination, inspired by the travels of the owners. Extra beds can be added to many of the rooms, and there is a deluxe duplex family room (China) sleeping four to six people. The lobby has a library of travel guides and leaflets, and staff are happy to advise about family-friendly activities in the vicinity. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/belgium/brussels/hotels/brussels-welcome-hotel//">Read expert review</a> From £ 83 per night <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/be/welcome.html?aid=839822;label=TMG-1travel1destinations1europe1belgium1brussels1articles1best0family0friendly0hotels0in0brussels-Brussels2Welcome2Hotel">Check availability</a> Rates provided by Booking.com</p>

      <p>The hotel building was the site of not just a Dominican Abbey, but also the home Jacques-Louis David, painter to Napoleon, in the early 19th century. The aesthetic is set by the flaming torches at the entrance, and the suite of stately, stone-flagged public rooms set around a courtyard. Yet there's also an emphasis on modern comfort and ease, as seen in the sleek bedroom furniture and extensive facilities. Dishes from a fine dining menu can be eaten anywhere in the suite of public rooms. The hotel provides extra beds and cots, and has some interconnecting rooms; there are five studio flats next door with kitchens. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/belgium/brussels/hotels/the-dominican-hotel//">Read expert review</a> From £ 108 per night <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/be/the-dominican.html?aid=839822;label=TMG-1travel1destinations1europe1belgium1brussels1articles1best0family0friendly0hotels0in0brussels-The2Dominican">Check availability</a> Rates provided by Booking.com</p>

      <p>The 'Louise' here refers to Avenue Louise, the chic shopping hub just to the south of central Brussels – and this boutique hotel, in a quiet street close by, is every bit as stylish. It is family-owned, which lends it a personalised charm. The core building dates from 1911 and still retains its historic charm, with an original six-storey stairwell, but everything has been upgraded with the flourish of a designer’s eye mixed with beguilingly ‘homemade’ touches seen in the individually styled rooms. There is a leafy courtyard at the back, and four family rooms with three beds and a cot (or double bed plus a single) are available. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/belgium/brussels/hotels/made-in-louise-hotel//">Read expert review</a> From £ 76 per night <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/be/louisehotel.html?aid=839822;label=TMG-1travel1destinations1europe1belgium1brussels1articles1best0family0friendly0hotels0in0brussels-Made2in2Louise">Check availability</a> Rates provided by Booking.com</p>

      <p>You know there's something special going on here from the railway carriage projecting over the street from the rooftop. The décor throughout is train-themed, with authentic railway memorabilia. Two historic railway carriages sit on the roof, one contains 14 low-cost shared ‘cabines’ (guests have to rent or bring their own sleeping bag and towel). The other carriage is an exclusive-use luxury suite with its own bathroom and rooftop terrace. There are a range of modern rooms providing flexible accommodation. The unique setting is a little children’s dream come true: if you’re game for a fun experience, it’s definitely worth the ride. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/belgium/brussels/hotels/train-hostel//">Read expert review</a> From £ 48 per night <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/be/train-hostel.html?aid=839822;label=TMG-1travel1destinations1europe1belgium1brussels1articles1best0family0friendly0hotels0in0brussels-Train2Hostel">Check availability</a> Rates provided by Booking.com</p>

      <p>This hotel is named after the area around Avenue Louise, the byword for high-end shopping in Brussels. Glamorous in itself, the hotel is also well-located for visiting the historic centre of Brussels and key Art Nouveau sites close by.

Following the Sofitel ‘MyBed’ system, the beds have a double mattress, with thin, super-comfortable upper mattress. Children will be delighted by the delicious cheeseburgers and tapas served at Crystal Lounge. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/belgium/brussels/hotels/sofitel-brussels-le-louise-hotel//">Read expert review</a> From £ 118 per night <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/be/sofitelbrusselstoisondor.html?aid=839822;label=TMG-1travel1destinations1europe1belgium1brussels1articles1best0family0friendly0hotels0in0brussels-Sofitel2Brussels2Le2Louise">Check availability</a> Rates provided by Booking.com</p>
