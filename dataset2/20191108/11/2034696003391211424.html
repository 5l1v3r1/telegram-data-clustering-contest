        <b>This is unexpected...</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="http://nme.com/artists/ed-sheeran">Ed Sheeran</a> is reportedly related to notorious Mafia hitman Frank Sheeran, the subject of Martin Scorsese’s new movie <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/movie/the-irishman-review-martin-scorsese-robert-de-niro"><i>The Irishman</i></a>.</p>
      <p>The mob movie, which hits cinemas today (November 8), sees Robert De Niro star as Sheeran and chronicles the Irish-American’s rise to power in the world of organised crime.</p>
      <p>Stephen Graham, who stars alongside de Niro as mobster Anthony Provenzano, says that Sheeran discussed his distant family ties to the mobster when they met a few months ago.</p>
      <p>“They’re related, you know. Honest to God — I swear on my nana’s life,” <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10301156/ed-sheeran-related-mafia-irishman/">Graham told The Sun.</a></p>

      <p>“That’s what Ed said, he says it’s his distant uncle.”</p>
      <p>Describing the film, Graham added: “It’s all based on true events, on Frank Sheeran. Before he passed away, he gave all this information to a ­journalist who turned it into a book.”</p>
      <p>The movie is based on Charles Brandt’s book <i>I Heard You Paint Houses</i>, in which Sheeran admits responsibility for the murder of US Union boss Jimmy Hoffa and provides key details about those involved.</p>
      <p>In a four-star review <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/movie/the-irishman-review-martin-scorsese-robert-de-niro">of The Irishman</a>, NME wrote: “If this is to be Pesci, De Niro and Scorsese’s final fling together, then they couldn’t wish to end on a better note. The director’s 26th feature film is a meditative and classy offering. Hollywood’s old cronies are still the real deal – magnetic, riveting and unique. Let’s hope we see them again soon.”</p>
