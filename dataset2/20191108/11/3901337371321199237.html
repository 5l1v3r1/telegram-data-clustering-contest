      <p>The 70-year-old, who has been linked with the Bayern Munich job, currently works as TV pundit for <i>beIN SPORTS</i>.</p>
      <p>He recently analysed Los Blancos' 6-0 win over Galatasaray, in which Belgium superstar Eden Hazard once again failed to impress.</p>

      <p>"I feel we have not seen the Hazard we know from England yet," Wenger said.</p>
      <p>"He was not physically fit after he was injured. He's not a player who is usually impressed by anything.</p>
      <p>"But he looked to me that he (doesn't have) the same confidence he had at Chelsea. He's not a type of guy to be (awestruck).</p>
      <p>"I think it was more down to physical reasons. He came too heavy, what you read in the papers.</p>
      <p>"If you want to make a horse lose a race, you put two kilograms on a horse of 500 kilograms and it's enough."</p>

      <p>Hazard joined Real for €100 million (R1.6 billion) ahead of this season, taking over the club's famous No. 7 shirt, but has scored just once in 10 appearances so far.</p>
