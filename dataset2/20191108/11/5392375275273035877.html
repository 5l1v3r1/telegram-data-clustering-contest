      <p>Yesterday, IDC released its first sale performance <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/07/idc-releases-its-first-sale-performance-report-for-5g-phones-in-china/">report for 5G smartphones in China</a>. The report shows that of the about 500,000 units shipped, Samsung has about 29% market share and its only second to Vivo with over 50% market share. As of now, all Samsung’s 5G smartphones are above the $700 mark. Nevertheless, it appears that we will soon have the first “cheap” 5G smartphone from the South Korean manufacturing giant. Samsung Galaxy A71 5G recently hit the web and it is supposed to be a “cheap” Samsung 5G phone.</p>

      <p>According to reports, Samsung is developing models SM-A7160 and Galaxy devices with 128GB of storage space. According to Samsung’s usual practice, the SM-A716B should be the Galaxy A71 5G global version. Also, considering that the Galaxy Note 10+ 5G with model number SM-N976B is the global version while the SM-N9760 is the Chinese version, the SM-A7160 should be the Galaxy A71 5G Chinese version.</p>
      <p>Regardless of whether it is indigenous or global, the SM-A7160 may be Samsung’s first mobile phone with Exynos 980 processor. Samsung currently uses the Snapdragon 855 and Exynos 9825 chipsets for its 5G smartphones. However, in order to reduce costs, Samsung recently launched the Exynos 980 processor for mid-range 5G phones.</p>
      <p>Thus, the Samsung Galaxy A71 5G could as well be a “cheap” 5G phone from Samsung with this chip. Nevertheless, it is the Vivo X 30 Series 5G phone that will launch the Exynos 980 SoC. This chip integrates the 5G modem that helps reduce power consumption. The Exynos 980 also supports the new Wi-Fi 6 standard, which is now unique to Samsung’s flagship smartphones and has other great features such as HDR10+ video decoding and support for 108MP camera sensors.</p>
