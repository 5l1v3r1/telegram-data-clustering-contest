      <p><b>TOMSK, Nov 8 – RIA Tomsk. </b>Organizers of the third film festival of the EU countries in Tomsk decided to sell tickets for sessions of 100 rubles to reduce excitement and increase the chances of more Tomsk citizens to get to at least one or more screenings, the employee of the press service of the festival Margarita Emelyanova reported RIA Tomsk.</p>
      <p>It was previously reported that the EU Film Festival has been held in Tomsk since 2017. The program includes films of different genres with a common idea of the value of diversity. In 2018, audience interest exceeded the expectations of the organizers, and the 12-day film marathon was extended for two days for repeated screenings. Entry to all sessions was free. The third festival will take place in the entertainment center Fakel from November 22 to December 4.</p>
      <blockquote>"This year the festival will not be free to attend, tickets will be sold at a symbolic price – 100 rubles... This is to ensure that everyone gets to the movie shows, because last year someone got on everything, and someone didn't get on any because of great interest. This year we decided to equalize the chances in this way", – Emelyanova said.</blockquote>
