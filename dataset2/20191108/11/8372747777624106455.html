      <p>LEE COUNTY, Fla. -- The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers says no changes are in their plans regarding water releases from Lake Okeechobee into the Caloosahatchee Estuary.</p>
      <p>The Corps had resumed water releases on October 5th at a rate of 650 cubic feet per second, averaged over seven days and measured at Franklin Lock and Dam. There had been several months of no water releases before that.</p>
      <p>They said Friday that no changes are being made. However, if local basin runoff meets or exceeds the targeted release amounts at W.P. Franklin Lock and Dam, no water will be released from Lake Okeechobee at Moore Haven Lock and Dam.</p>

      </p>
      <p>No scheduled releases through the St. Lucie Lock and Dam are planned at this time.</p>
      <p>"We continue to release water for environmental enhancement of plant and aquatic life in the estuary," said Col. Andrew Kelly, Jacksonville District commander. "October rainfall has resulted in the lake holding steady at about the same stage as it was near the end of September. This is helpful because the lake typically recedes a half-foot monthly during dry season. The steady lake levels put us in a better position moving forward."</p>
      <p>Today's stage at Lake Okeechobee is 13.35 feet, down 0.10 feet in the last week, and down 0.08 feet during the past 30 days.</p>
