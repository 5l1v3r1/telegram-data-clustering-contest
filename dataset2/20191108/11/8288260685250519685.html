      <h1>'Right direction' - Former Birmingham City starlet signs new contract</h1>
      <h2>Latest Birmingham City news | The former Blues defender left St Andrew's in the summer after being released by the club</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T11:42:04+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 11:42</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Wakefield</a></address>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Birmingham City</a> youngster Dom Bernard has been rewarded for his recent form with a new contract at Forest Green Rovers.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old was <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/under-23s-birmingham-city-decided-16007523">released by Blues at the end of last season</a> , leaving the club without a single first-team appearance to his name.</p>
      <p>The versatile defender was then taken on trial by Forest Green in the summer, and was handed an initial one-year deal with the League Two outfit.</p>
      <p>Bernard’s performances for Forest Green have impressed enough to see him awarded an extension on his previous deal, with the new contract running up to the end of the 2020/21 campaign.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The former Blues defender has gone on to make 18 appearances already this season in all competitions, showing his flexibility by playing at right-back, right wing-back and right of a defensive back three in that time.</p>
      <p>Bernard went on to express his delight at signing his new deal, and is determined to improve on his good start at his new club.</p>
      <p>“I’m happy to be at this great club which is going in the right direction,” Bernard told the club’s website.</p>

      <p>“Obviously I am happy to be involved in the majority of the games, I have adapted well and everything is going well at the moment and long may it continue.</p>
      <p>“With the formation we play, we’ve changed it around and I have played right-back and right centre-back as well, it’s ideal and the versatility of having to adapt to those positions, is quite comfortable for me.</p>
      <p>“We’ve been talking for a week now and I signed my contract in the summer and this is a good extension, something that I wanted to build on but that is off the pitch and I am glad that it is done.”</p>
