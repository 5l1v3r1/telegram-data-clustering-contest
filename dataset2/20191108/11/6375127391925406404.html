      <h1>MMDA enforcers get renewed accident insurance</h1>

      <h3>THE Metropolitan Manila Development Authority and Pru Life UK on Thursday renewed their partnership to provide employees insurance support in case of accident while in the line of duty.</h3>
      <p>MMDA Chairman Danilo Lim said Pru Life UK again extended its commitment to providing accident insurance coverage to MMDA’s 8,000 personnel with premiums fully waived for another year as he expressed gratitude to the private firm.</p>
      <p>“We thank Pru Life UK for granting our 8,000 agency employees - permanent, casual and job personnel - free accident insurance for the third consecutive year. The program will surely protect them and grant assurance to their loved ones in the event of an accident while performing their duty,” said Lim.</p>
      <p>The Memorandum of Agreement was signed during the MMDA’s 44th anniversary celebration.</p>
      <p>To date, 26 family beneficiaries of insured MMDA employees have received financial assistance under the partnership.</p>
      <p>The agreement is in line with the life insurance’s advocacy to raise awareness on the importance of safe road usage for the welfare of motorists, pedestrians and other road users through the Safe Steps Road Safety Program.</p>
      <p>The partnership, first established in 2017, has enabled the dissemination of Safe Steps Road Safety educational and awareness materials—created and developed by Prudence Foundation, the community investment arm of Prudential in Asia and Africa—across MMDA’s key communication platforms, including LED gantries on EDSA, steel pylons along main avenues in Metro Manila, as well as MMDA’s official website and social media pages, spreading awareness of key topics such as drunk driving, distracted driving, seat belts, speed limits, motorcycles and pedestrians.</p>
      <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that 1.35 million individuals were killed on roads globally every year, including 500 children every day. It was cited that road accidents are the number one cause of death of five to 29-year-olds and prevail as a life-threatening issue in Asia.</p>
