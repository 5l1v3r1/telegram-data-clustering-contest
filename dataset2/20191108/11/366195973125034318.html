      <p>Though the <i>Game Of Thrones </i>logic of "any man who must call himself king is no true king" is sound, it most certainly does not apply in the realm of hip-hop or RnB. In fact, the latter's world was thrust into a veritable succession struggle, when the title of King Of RnB became the most sought after property since the <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/Da-Baby/profile/">DaBaby</a> feature. Jacquees damn near made an entire marketing campaign about it, taking the process to its natural conclusion <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/jacqueess-king-and-randb-hosts-features-by-ti-young-thug-gunna-quavo-tory-lanez-and-more-new-mixtape.119752.html">with his brand new <i>King Of RnB </i>mixtape.</a> Though the verdict remains to be seen, it's nice to see Jacquees moving to stake his claim.</p>
      <p>On "Risk It All," Jacquees enlists a truly versatile Canadian, <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/ToryLanez/profile">Tory Lanez</a>, to play the King's Hand. What follows is a smooth dose of RnB vibes, bubbly enough to keep the finger off "skip." It's unlikely this one manifests into a timeless hit, but it's a testament to Jacquee's effortless nature; he makes this whole thing look easy, as a good ruler should. Did you listen to his latest yet? And if so, what say you?</p>
