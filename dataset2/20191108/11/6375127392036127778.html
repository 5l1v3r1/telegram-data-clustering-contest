      <p>MEMBERS of the Anti-Fraud and Commercial Crimes Unit of the Philippine National Police Criminal Investigation and Detection Group on Monday arrested an extortionist posing as an employee of the Department of Public Works and Highways during an entrapment operation at a fast-food restaurant in Araneta Center in Cubao, Quezon City.</p>
      <p>PNP-CIDG director Brigadier General Joel Napoleon M. Coronel said suspect Romeo Sanita along with his cohort identified as Anthony Reyes were arrested during a sting conducted by undercover officers of the CIDG-AFCCU following a complaint from Ramonito Bautista, the incumbent chairman of Barangay San Jose Malino in Mexico, Pampanga.</p>
      <p>According to the complainant, Sanita approached him and introduced himself as a DPWH employee in-charge of several DPWH projects including a flood control project in Calaylayan, Abucay, Bataan.</p>
      <p>The local official said he was convinced by the glib-tongued suspect that he could earn big money if he decides to invest on their projects. He added that he gave a total of P250,000 to the suspect who promised him that he will help him win the flood control project.</p>
      <p>However, the barangay captain’s suspicion’s grew when he found out that the suspect is now in any way connected or affiliated with the DPWH. He also learned that the construction projects in Abucay were already completed since 2018.</p>
