        <i>This profile of Matt Busby deals well with the horror of the Munich air disaster – but fails to reveal much about its subject</i>
      </p>
      <p>After cinema releases for documentaries about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/04/shankly-natures-fire-review-reverent-portrait-of-liverpool-fc-legend-bill-shankly-documentary">Bill Shankly</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/01/bobby-robson-more-than-a-manager-review">Bobby Robson</a>, it was only matter of time before attention turned to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jan/14/manchester-united-manager-matt-busby">Matt Busby</a>, who produced Manchester United’s glamour sides of the late 1950s and 60s and forged the club’s identity.</p>
      <p>There’s an understandably elegaic tone to this profile. Busby’s career as a manager was dominated – and interrupted – by the horrors of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/from-the-archive-blog/2018/feb/05/munich-air-disaster-crash-manchester-united-busby-1958">Munich air crash</a>, which claimed the lives of eight of his players. The best, and most interesting, material here is that which covers the aftermath of the disaster: the eerie atmosphere of the subsequent games, the absence of any counselling or indeed much sympathy for the survivors, Busby’s recovery period, and resolute team-building to plug the gaps in the devastated side.</p>
      <p>As the world knows, Busby found a new generation of stars and went on to his great triumph, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/may/23/manchester-united-1968-winners-wembley">winning the European Cup in 1968</a>. Although all this is pretty familiar from a thousand TV clip shows, the focus on Busby’s travails over the years makes a little more sense of the well-aired line that the players wanted to win it for him. And as with Alex Ferguson decades later, the succession did not go well: one manager after another failed to escape the giant shadow. But Busby was clearly someone who didn’t want to give much away: other than noting his occasional ruthless streak, this film, decent though it is, doesn’t really get past the public image.</p>
