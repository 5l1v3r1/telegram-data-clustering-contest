      <h1>Merry Hill issues statement after Mothercare collapse</h1>
      <h2>The child and baby retailer is expected to launch a closing down sale at intu Merry Hill today after collapsing into administration</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T11:37:17+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 11:37</time> by <a rel="author">Graeme Brown, https://www.facebook.com/graemebrum/?fref=ts</a></address>
      <p>Bosses of Merry Hill say they are working to ensure a "great mix of stores" after Mothercare became the latest victim of the High Street downturn.</p>
      <p>The child and baby retailer is expected to <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/black-country/mothercare-launches-massive-closing-down-17221834">launch a closing down sale at intu Merry Hill</a> and 78 other UK stores today after collapsing into administration.</p>
      <p>It is set to become the latest store to be lost to Merry Hill, after the likes of Cath Kidston and Druckers this year, although there has also been a spate of new openings.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson from Merry Hill said: “We await further details on Mothercare’s plans, and if these will impact the store at intu Merry Hill.</p>
      <p>"Our visitors can be assured that we will continue to work closely with existing and new brands to deliver the great mix of stores, leisure and entertainment that they expect, with the arrival of Mango and Hobbs both opening at the centre later this month.”</p>
      <p>Black Country Live revealed this morning that a closing down sale would launch today.</p>
      <p>There were no signs at the Merry Hill store this morning, and a member of staff told our reporter she was in the dark about it.</p>
      <p>But a Mothercare spokesman said: "To confirm, the sale rolls out across all stores today."</p>
