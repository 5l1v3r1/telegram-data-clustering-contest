      <p>The main suspect in the investigation into the kidnapping and torture of Northern Ireland businessman Kevin Lunney has died this morning, PA news agency sources have said.</p>
      <p>The man, in his 50s, took ill when police were searching his home in Derbyshire, England this morning.</p>
      <p>Searches are taking place at a number of locations in Ireland and the UK this morning in relation to Lunney's abduction and torture.</p>
      <p>As well as the operation in Derbyshire, five locations in Co Cavan, three locations in Co Longford and four locations in Dublin are also being searched. Meanwhile, the PSNI is also searching four homes and a business in Derrylin, Co. Fermanagh.</p>
      <p>Kevin Lunny was abducted on September 17 and subjected to a vicious criminal attack on September 17, before being found bleeding on a remote roadside after being dumped in Co. Cavan.</p>
      <p>Speaking to BBC Northern Irelandâ€™s Spotlight programme, he said he dragged his injured body across country roads fearing he would die before he could be rescued.</p>
      <p>His captors then told him they wanted him to resign from QIH, which he agreed to before the torture started.</p>
      <p>The attack was the latest in a series targeting the companies and directors that now control the business portfolio that was built up by fallen tycoon Sean Quinn.</p>
