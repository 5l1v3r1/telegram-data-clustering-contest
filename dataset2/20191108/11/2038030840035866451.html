      <p>Cape Town – Kanye West may run for president in 2024.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://people.com/music/kanye-west-run-for-president-might-change-his-name/"><b>People</b></a>, speaking at Fast Company's Innovation Festival, the <i>Jesus Is King</i> rapper first announced he was considering changing his name. "When people say it's crass to call yourself a billionaire, I say I might legally change my name to Christian Genius Billionaire Kanye West for a year until y'all understand exactly what it is," he said. "It will be on the license plate."</p>
      <p>He then continued, "When I run for president in 2024..." and when the crowd erupted in laughter continued, "What y'all laughing at?"</p>
      <p>It looks like Kanye started campaigning early – he went on to talk about prison reform and unemployment saying, "When I run for president in 2024 we would've created so many jobs, I’m not going to run, I’m going to walk," – but this isn't the first time the 42-year-old's mentioned his plans to become the leader of the free world.</p>
      <p>Hours before the release of his much-anticipated album, <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/Music/News/kanye-west-claims-he-will-one-day-be-us-president-20191025"><b>Kanye told Apple Music's Beats 1's Zane Lowe</b></a>, "There will be a time when I will be the president of the US, and I will remember... any founder that didn't have the capacity to understand culturally what we were doing."  </p>
