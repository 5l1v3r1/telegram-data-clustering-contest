      <p>DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - Vodacom Tanzania’s core earnings rose 9.3% in the six months to the end of September, driven by increased revenue from its financial and data provision services, it said on Friday.</p>
      <p>Tanzania’s biggest telecoms operator, which is partly owned by South Africa’s Vodacom, said revenue from its M-Pesa financial services operations grew 15.9%, while its data business posted 17.4% revenue growth.</p>
      <p>Earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation, known as core earnings, were 147 billion shillings ($63.91 million).</p>
      <p>The company added 760,000 new customers during the period, said Chief Executive Hisham Hendi, adding that he expected further growth momentum from the financial services business.</p>
      <p>M-Pesa expanded to Tanzania from neighboring Kenya, where it was launched by Safaricom, part of the Vodacom group, in 2007.</p>
      <p>It now contributes just over a third of Vodacom Tanzania’s total revenue, the firm said.</p>
      <p>Hendi said the company was rushing to comply with a government order to register all mobile phone subscribers using their biometric features to curb cyber-crime by the end of this year.</p>
      <p>“There are concerns (about) the wider impact of the envisaged deadline if customers have to be switched off to ensure compliance,” he said.</p>
