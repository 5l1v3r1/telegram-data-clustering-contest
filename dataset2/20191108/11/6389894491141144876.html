      <p>The Labour Party candidate for Clacton has stepped down after allegations he made an antisemitic remark to a fellow Labour councillor.</p>
      <p>Gideon Bull, who is a cabinet member in Haringey council, was accused of calling Jewish councillor Zena Brabazon “Shylock” during a private meeting.</p>
      <p>Bull denied he called Brabazon “Shylock” but admitted he used the term.</p>

      <p>Shylock is the Jewish moneylender in William Shakespeare’s The Merchant of Venice.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Bull said: “The allegation that I called a Jewish cabinet member ‘Shylock’ is entirely false. I used an analogy when referring to a housing decision being called in by backbenchers. I was not referring to the councillor, who was not part of the call in.</p>
      <p>“When she politely informed me that this saying was offensive, I immediately apologised and explained that I did not know that Shylock was Jewish and I would never have mentioned Shylock if I had known this.”</p>
      <p>Bull added: “I’ve decided that right now is not the best time for me to stand as a candidate.”</p>
      <p>Brabazon reportedly made a complaint about the remark, sparking a Labour Party investigation.</p>
      <p>Brabazon is the London borough’s deputy council leader and Bull is cabinet member for local investment and economic growth.</p>

      <p>The Labour Party has been repeatedly accused of institutional antsemitism since Jeremy Corbyn was elected as leader in 2015.</p>
      <p>Today, the <a href="https://www.thejc.com/comment/leaders/to-all-our-fellow-british-citizens-1.491812">Jewish Chronicle published a front page article</a> denouncing Corbyn and urging voters not to back him at the general election.</p>
      <p>“The vast majority of British Jews consider Jeremy Corbyn to be an antisemite. In the most recent poll, last month, the figure was 87 per cent,” the paper wrote.</p>
      <p>“If this man is chosen as our next prime minister, the message will be stark: that our dismay that he could ever be elevated to a prominent role in British politics, and our fears of where that will lead, are irrelevant,” it said.</p>
      <p>Brabazon and the Labour Party were contacted for comment.</p>
