      <p>About 130,464 pounds of raw ground beef products have been recalled<b> </b>because they may contain plastic, the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced Thursday.</p>
      <p>The products subject to the recall are 16-oz vacuum sealed packages of "Nature's Rancher 100% Grass Fed Organic Ground Beef 85% Lean, 15% Fat" and "Nature's Rancher 100% Grass Fed Organic Ground Beef 93% Lean, 7% Fat," the USDA said.</p>
      <p>These products, recalled by Rastelli Foods Group, have use or freeze by dates of 10/24/19, 10/31/19, 11/04/19, 11/07/19, and 11/11/19.</p>
      <p>The products were sent to distribution centers and then retail locations in Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois and Maryland.</p>
      <p>The recall was initiated by customer complaints, though there have been no confirmed adverse reactions from the products, the USDA said.</p>
      <p>The USDA said consumers who have purchased the beef should not consume it, and anyone concerned about illness should contact a healthcare provider.</p>
