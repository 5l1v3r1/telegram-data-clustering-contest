      <h1>Silk Road drug dealer laundered $19M in profits with Bitcoin</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T11:02:14+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 11:02</time> by <a rel="author">Yessi Bello Perez</a></address>
      <p>A Silk Road trader pleaded guilty to laundering over $19 million worth of profits with Bitcoin <a href="https://partners.etoro.com/B9157_A72407_TClick.aspx">BTC</a> after using the notorious marketplace to sell drugs.</p>
      <p>Hugh Brian Haney, who <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/dark-web-narcotics-trafficker-pleads-guilty-laundering-more-19-million">pleaded guilty</a> in Manhattan federal court earlier this week, was found to be a high-ranking member of Pharmville — a prominent narcotics vendor on the dark web — after law enforcement searched his home in Ohio last year.</p>
      <p>Additionally, agents found a computer that housed a document entitled “HBD daily to-do list,” which referred to Pharmville.</p>
      <p>In 2017 and 2018, Haney sent his Bitcoin earnings from an address connected to Silk Road, to an account he had with a cryptocurrency exchange.</p>
      <p>In correspondence with the exchange, Haney claimed he had legitimately earned Bitcoin through mining and trading, but it actually derived from his activity on Silk Road.</p>
      <p>U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said:  “Hugh Haney used Silk Road as a means to sell drugs to people all over the world.  Then he laundered more than $19 million in profits through cryptocurrency. Peddling drugs on the Dark Web does not provide anonymity forever, as Hugh Haney can attest.”</p>
      <h3>Cryptocurrency, drugs, and the dark web</h3>
      <p>Haney is certainly not the first drug dealer to have been caught after conducting his illicit operations on the dark web.</p>
      <p>Back in April, a Canadian judge <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/04/04/canada-confiscates-1-4m-in-bitcoin-from-dark-web-drug-dealer/">confiscated $1.4M in Bitcoin</a> from a dark web drug dealer. More recently, a judge in Texas <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/10/04/dark-web-fentanyl-cryptocurrency-dealer-sentenced-30-years/">sentenced an Iraqi man</a> to 30 years behind bars after he sold several narcotics in exchange for cryptocurrency on the dark web.</p>
      <p>Also in October, a father and daughter <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/10/04/dad-and-daughter-to-serve-time-over-mail-order-cryptocurrency-drug-ring/">received a combined prison sentence</a> of eight years after selling drugs in exchange for Bitcoin on the dark web.</p>
      <p>The proliferation of cryptocurrency-fueled activity on the hidden internet shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone.</p>
      <p>What’s interesting is that a recent study by Europol said <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/10/14/europol-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-underground-organized-crime-monero-privacy/">Bitcoin was still the dark web‘s favorite cryptocurrency</a> — but those looking to cover their tracks were slowly getting to grips with using privacy-focused alternatives.</p>
