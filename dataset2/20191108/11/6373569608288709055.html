      <h1>Odds on White Christmas in UK slashed by bookies</h1>
      <h2>It would be the first time since 2010 that snow has fallen on Christmas Day</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T11:33:44+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 11:33</time> by <a rel="author">Jamie Hawkins</a></address>
      <p>Bookies have slashed the odds on the UK having a White Christmas for the first time in nine years.</p>
      <p>Coral are offering odds of 4/5 that the UK will have a White Christmas in 2019 with forecasters predicting that snow will begin to fall as early as this week.</p>
      <p>
        <b>But what actually counts towards a White Christmas?</b>
      </p>
      <p>If there’s snowfall on Buckingham Palace, Aldergrove Airport in Belfast, Pittodrie Stadium in Aberdeen, Edinburgh Castle, Manchester’s Coronation Street or the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff that will count towards a bookie’s payout just as well.</p>
      <p>William Hill has also revealed odds on a White Christmas at some UK airports, including one in Cornwall.</p>
      <p>The bookmaker has current odds of snow on Christmas Day at Penzance (RNAS Culdrose) at 12/1.</p>

      <p>Coral's Harry Aitkenhead told the <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/white-christmas-odds-slashed-bookies-20823202">Daily Star</a>: ""The big winter freeze is about to get underway and there's a definite chance of the next few months breaking the record for the coldest winter since records began.</p>
      <p>"Snow is set to sprinkle over the UK in the next week and it's raising excitement about the prospect of a White Christmas this year. We currently make it odds on that we do get a dash of the white stuff somewhere in the UK on the big day."</p>
      <h3>What is a white Christmas?</h3>

      <p>The definition that the Met Office uses to define a white Christmas is for one snowflake to be observed falling in the 24 hours of 25 December somewhere in the UK.</p>
      <p>Traditionally we used to use a single location in the country to define a white Christmas, which was the Met Office building in London. However, with the increase in betting on where will see a white Christmas, the number of locations have increased and can now include sites such as Buckingham Palace, Belfast (Aldergrove Airport), Aberdeen (Pittodrie Stadium, Aberdeen FC), Edinburgh (Castle), Coronation Street in Manchester and the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.</p>
      <p>We also analyse the data from our observing stations around the UK to provide a complete picture of where snow has fallen or was lying on Christmas Day.</p>
      <h3>How likely is a white Christmas?</h3>
      <p>We can accurately forecast if snow is likely on any given Christmas Day up to five days beforehand. In terms of the statistical likelihood of snow based on climatology, we know that a snowflake has fallen somewhere in the UK on Christmas Day 38 times in the last 54 years, so we can probably expect more than half of all Christmas Days to be a 'white Christmas'.</p>
      <p>However, the Dickensian scene of widespread snow lying on the ground on Christmas Day is much rarer. There has only been a widespread covering of snow on the ground (where more than 40 % of stations in the UK reported snow on the ground at 9 am) four times in the last 51 years.</p>
