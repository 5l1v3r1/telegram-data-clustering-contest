      <p>Toni Kroos has been one of Real Madrid's best players this season. After the win over Galatasaray, the German spoke about teammate Gareth Bale's call up to the Wales team.</p>
      <p>Bale has not played for Madrid since the last international break but looks set to return for Wales next week as they look to book their place at Euro 2020 with two qualifying games.</p>
      <p>"It seems inconvenient to return from your national team, not playing with your club and then to be in the right condition again when you have to return to the national team," Kroos told Realtotal.de.</p>
      <p>"The moment may not be the best. I hope he will be fine again when he returns [from international duty]. I am convinced that we will still need his quality in many matches."</p>
      <p>Bale has not played for Madrid since Oct.5 against Granada. After failing to secure a move away in the summer, rumours how now resurfaced that he could leave in January.</p>
      <p>"I do not know what will happen," Kroos added. "He was about to leave in the summer. After something like that, it is not so easy to get back to normal, but I get the impression that he is very motivated."</p>
