      <p>The Pokémon Company has released a quirky new tool on its official Japanese website, allowing fans of the series to relive their favourite moments from the last couple of decades.</p>
      <p>You can access the tool <a href="https://greatstory.pokemon.co.jp/">right here</a>; the whole thing is in Japanese, but you'll just about be able to get by with the standard (if pretty poor) translation tool available within the Google Chrome browser. Fans are asked to select the regions they've discovered - so whether you started playing Pokémon way back in the old days with <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/pokemon_red_and_blue"><b>Red and Blue</b></a>, or much more recently with <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/pokemon_sun_and_moon"><b>Sun and Moon</b></a>, you'll definitely be covered.</p>
      <p>From there, it's a simple case of choosing highlights from each game such as your starter Pokémon, memorable battles, and memorable story scenes. Once you're done, a shareable video will be created which you can post to your social media platform of choice. You can also generate a standard URL for your video, so feel free to grab those and post them in our comment section below.</p>

      <p>You'll notice that the end of the video also adds in a few scenes from the upcoming <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_sword_and_shield"><b>Pokémon Sword and Shield</b></a>, which we're sure plenty of you will be tucking into next week. Can you believe the games are out in exactly a week's time?</p>
