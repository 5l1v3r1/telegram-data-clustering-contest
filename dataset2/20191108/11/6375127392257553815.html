      <h3>LUCENA CITY— The Quezon Police Provincial Office is now tracking down a police Sergeant who reportedly went AWOL (absent without official leave) after he was tested positive for shabu.</h3>
      <p>Quezon police director Col. Audie Madrideo said he has ordered his operatives from Provincial Intelligence Branch and Lucena City police station to locate PSSG Mark Reil Canilon, assigned at the City Drug Enforcement Unit (CDEU) and resident of Rizal province.</p>
      <p>Madrideo said he issued the order in consonance with the instruction of Calabarzon police director Beig. Gen. Vicente Danao, Jr. to find Canilon and have him disarmed.</p>
      <p>“Once accounted and disarmed of his service pistol, Canilon will also be asked to explain why he did not report to duty shortly after undergoing a surprise drug test on Wednesday”, said Madrideo.</p>
      <p>He said the on the spot drug test of 24 police non- commisioned officers — most of them members of CDEU and Intelligence Section of the City police station — was ordered by Danao on Wednesday after the regional director received reports that some of them are in cahoots with drug syndicates.</p>
      <p>There are also reports that some of the cops even recycle confiscated shabu, Madrideo said.</p>
