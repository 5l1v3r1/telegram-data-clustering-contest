      <p>Facebook employees repeatedly chafed at what they viewed as anti-competitive or unethical practices by the company, internal chats show. But their concerns, voiced in 2012 and 2013, were <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-08/facebook-staff-lamented-unethical-practices-but-were-rebuffed">overruled by senior managers including Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg</a>, who argued that the survival of the social network was more important. From a report:<i> The messages come from a roughly 7,000-page trove of leaked documents that were part of a years-old lawsuit in San Mateo County, California. The interactions are likely to be scrutinized further as Facebook faces ongoing antitrust investigations. In multiple discussions found in the documents, employees, including some top executives, argued against policies that would cut off competitors' ability to advertise on the platform and access Facebook's audience and user information, which it provided to non-competing companies.<br/><br/>Zuckerberg, in a November 2012 email, justified the decision to not provide services to competitors. Facebook software that helped app developers increase sharing "may be good for the world but it's not good for us unless people also share back to Facebook and that content increases the value of our network," Zuckerberg wrote. The company's ultimate goal should be "to increase sharing back into Facebook," he added. In later messages, Zuckerberg also argued against giving competing companies access to other Facebook services.</i></p>
