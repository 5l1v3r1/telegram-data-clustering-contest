      <p>"The festive season has begun on a good note for Renault India, and we are thankful to our customers for the encouraging response to our new game changer, the Renault Triber. With 10,000 cars already delivered and a strong bookings pipeline, we have ramped up the production and are taking concerted efforts to further accelerate production to enable faster deliveries and the best in class quality. Together with the metro cities, Renault Triber has seen wide acceptance in the rural markets as well, and we have a robust strategy to build our presence across these markets, which offers significant growth potential," said Venkatram Mamillapalle, Country CEO and Managing Director, Renault India Operations.</p>

      <p>The prices for the Triber start at Rs 4.95 lakh ex-showroom. The MPV is available in four trim levels and following is a price-wise break-up for the same.</p>
      <p><a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/renault/triber/rxe-v8483/">Renault Triber RXE</a> - Rs 4.95 lakh ex-showroom</p>
      <p><a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/renault/triber/rxl-v8486/">Renault Triber RXL</a> - Rs 5.49 lakh ex-showroom</p>
      <p><a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/renault/triber/rxt-v8489/">Renault Triber RXT</a> - Rs 5.99 lakh ex-showroom</p>

      <p>Powering the Triber is a 1.0-litre 3-cylinder engine mated to a 5-speed gearbox. Currently, the Triber is available in petrol guise only and the manufacturers have not disclosed any plans to introduce a diesel variant. The petrol variant of the Triber is yet to meet the new BSVI norms to be set in the country which could hike the price of the Triber significantly (by Rs 20,000-30,000 across all variants).</p>
