      <p>The Brazilian government has announced it will create a network of eight research facilities focused on artificial intelligence (AI). <br/><br/>The minister of science, technology, innovation and communications, Marcos Pontes, made the announcement during the opening speech of an event focused on public sector innovation in the country's capital, Brasília. <br/><br/>"[The creation of the centers] has been one of the priorities [for the Ministry] in order to improve the country's capabilities around AI," Pontes said. <br/><br/>Specific timescales and details around locations, investment and potential partners are currently being defined and should be announced in a soon-to-be-released tender. <br/><br/>According to the minister, one of the labs will focused on edge AI technology in areas such as cybersecurity and will involve the Brazilian Army.</p>
      <p>The other seven centers will work on applied AI. Four of these venues will be working on the technology in line with the national Internet of Things (IoT) plan. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/brazilian-iot-plan-inches-closer-to-reality/">The four core verticals of Brazil's IoT plan </a>are Smart Cities, Healthcare, Agribusiness and Manufacturing. The plan was preceded by a study, funded by Brazil's National Development Bank (BNDES) and carried out by a consortium led by consulting firm McKinsey.</p>
      <p>Another AI center within the network announced by minister Pontes will be focusing on the application of artificial intelligence technologies in government. <br/><br/>The Brazilian government has already put the wheels in motion to get the building blocks ready to fully exploit AI in the public sector. For example, it has announced <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/brazilian-government-to-create-single-citizen-database/">the creation of a single citizen database</a> in October, which will contain a wide range of personal information about the country's population of over 200 million people, to be fully shared across departments.<br/><br/>"What has made a difference throughout history is the ability to work in teams; the ability to reason, plan and think about the future; and our ability to create tools to solve problems and improve quality of life, " Pontes said during his speech.<br/><br/>"We have created magnificent things, we have gone through many transformations - machines, engines, electricity, electronics, computers, airplanes - and we have reached a point now that is very special, which is digital transformation," he added. "We now have [technology] that aids the creation of other tools that help us plan and work in teams."<br/><br/>The announcement of the AI lab network follows the creation of a partnership between IBM and the São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) to launch a <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ibm-to-launch-ai-research-center-in-brazil/">major AI research center in São Paulo next year. </a><br/><br/>The AI center will be the first Latin American institution of IBM's AI Horizons Network. <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/university-of-sao-paulo-wins-tender-for-brazils-largest-ai-research-center/">It will be jointly run by IBM, FAPESP and the University of São Paulo</a> to pursue "a disruptive research program", with the potential to "promote paradigm shifts in AI."</p>
