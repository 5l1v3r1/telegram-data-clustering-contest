      <h3>AN arriving Filipina  passenger was arrested by agents of the Bureau of Customs for attempting to smuggle in six kilos of crystallized substance believed to be Methamphetamine Hydrochloride or shabu with an estimated street value of P40.8 million early yesterday morning at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport.</h3>
      <p>According to the office of BoC-NAIA District Collector Carmelita ‘Mimel’ Talusan, the suspect identified as Marie Guillermo Ruzol, 28, was intercepted upon her arrival at NAIA Terminal 3 via Cebu Pacific flight 5J258 from Siem Reap, Cambodia, at around 4 a.m.</p>
      <p>When customs personnel, in close  coordination with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, subjected Ruzol’s baggage to physical examination, they found white crystalline substances in her two handbags placed inside the backpack. The white crystalline substances were concealed in a tea foil pack.</p>
      <p>Talusan said a similar shipment of shabu from Cambodia was seized in Terminal 1 last September. Another shipment in the same terminal was intercepted last month.</p>
      <p>Talusan added that her team remains steadfast in implementing border security measures. She said, the apprehensions were the result of Customs Commissioner Rey Guerrero directives to all ports to be vigilant in the entry of illegal goods country.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Three persons who were online sellers of marijuana were arrested in a buy-bust and seized from them P1.4 million worth  of ready-to-use marijuana leaves yesterday morning in Quezon City.</p>
      <p>QCPD director Col. Ronnie Montejo said suspects Jon Paulo Flores, 29, of Caloocan City, Ryan Erpelo, 29, of Batangas City, and Kees Van Paul Lorenzo, 34, of Bgy. Sta. Lucia, Novaliches, were initially monitored through Facebook messenger.</p>
      <p>A confidential informant tipped off the QCPD about the suspects’ alleged transactions in a group chat.</p>
      <p>The suspects were arrested in front of a fast food store on Susana Road in Bgy. Novaliches Proper, after the suspects agreed to deliver P40,000 worth of marijuana to a policeman who acted as poseur buyer.</p>
      <p>During interrogation, Lorenzo admitted that he has more stocks at his house on Maximo Drive, in Bgy. San Agustin, Novaliches. Police were able to seize an approximately 12 kilos of dried marijuana leaves worth P1.4 million inside a van.</p>
