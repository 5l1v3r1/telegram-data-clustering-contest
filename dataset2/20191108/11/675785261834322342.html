      <h1>Riverdale season 4 fans fear Betty Cooper will become a serial killer</h1>
      <h2>Riverdale fans are worried for the Lili Reinhart character following the latest episode, Witness for the Prosecution</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T11:50:15+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 11:50</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Knight, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/lewis-knight/</a></address>
      <p>It's all kicking off in Riverdale this week.</p>
      <p>The latest episode of the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/netflix">Netflix</a> teen drama saw Veronica Lodge (Camila Mendes) deal with her parents facing trial and the shocking arrival of her half-sister, while Archie (KJ Apa) worked to defend the town, and Jughead (Cole Sprouse) continued his sleuthing techniques.</p>
      <p>However, one aspect that's making conversation is now that Betty Cooper (Lili Reinhart) has joined the junior FBI and has revealed a latent ability: serial killer detecting skills!</p>
      <p>As if that wasn't enough, Betty also had a totally normal flashback to when she murdered her cat Caramel as a child, albeit on her father Hal's (aka the Black Hood) orders.</p>
      <p>Despite being an apparent mercy killing, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/riverdale">Riverdale</a> fans will no doubt be worried about the emergence of Dark Betty.</p>

      <p>One fan concerned on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> , saying: "So what's Betty's deal, is she a serial killer in the making? <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23riverdale">#riverdale</a> "</p>
      <p>Another is less convinced, saying: "I can't believe Betty thinks SHE'S a serial killer while her FATHER literally made her do that"</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, another fan was more concerned with her serial killer detecting abilities: "So it took most of season two for Betty to realize her father was the black hood but she was able to identify serial killers from thier mugshots? <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Riverdale">#Riverdale</a> "</p>
      <p>This feeling was shared by another viewer too: "So... Betty is able to tell if someone's a serial killer from looking at mugshots but couldn't tell that she was living with one her whole life???? <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Riverdale">#Riverdale</a> "</p>
      <p>Finally, one viewer was just processing the insane plot developments going on: "Season 4 character read so far. Archie is a night vigilante, Betty is a potential serial killer, Jughead has mad anger issues and Veronica has a hot older half sister "</p>
      <p>Can't say it's ever dull in Riverdale.</p>
