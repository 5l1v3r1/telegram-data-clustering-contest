      <p>The head of the Muslim World League (MWL) has stressed that the approach adopted by the MWL was to constantly call on Muslims and all minorities to abide by the constitutions and laws of their countries, and not to receive religious fatwas from outside parties which had nothing to do with where they were living. <br/><br/>Dr. Mohammed bin Abdulkarim Al-Issa has met with US congressman John Curtis who praised Al-Issa’s important role on behalf of the MWL in strengthening ties between countries and peoples. <br/><br/>Al-Issa also held talks in Washington with Michigan representative, Debbie Dingell, who lauded his work in encouraging religious minorities to adapt in their communities, emphasizing that they had benefited from these efforts in her state of Michigan, which had the largest Muslim community in the US. <br/><br/>Also, Al-Issa met with the chaplain of the US Senate, Dr. Barry Black. <br/><br/>They reviewed a number of topics of mutual interest, most notably the means of establishing religious and national harmony in societies of religious and ethnic diversity, and the need for coordination among world faith institutions in promoting the message of tolerance.</p>
