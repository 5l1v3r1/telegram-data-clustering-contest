      <p>BANGKOK (Reuters) - Police in Thailand on Friday blamed the worst attack in years in the country’s restive south on the region’s main Muslim insurgent group, the Barisan Revolusi Nasional.</p>
      <p>Fifteen people, including a police officer and many village defense volunteers, were killed on late on Tuesday when suspected separatists stormed a security checkpoint in Yala.</p>
      <p>It was the worst single attack in years in a restive region where a long-running Muslim insurgency has killed thousands of people in a fight against central government rule in overwhelmingly Buddhist Thailand.</p>
      <p>There has been no immediate claim of responsibility, as is common with such attacks in the region.</p>
      <p>“We have evidence indicating that it was the BRN,” said Ronnasilp Pusara, a police commander in the south, referring to the Barisan Revolusi Nasional, the main insurgent group operating in the south.</p>
      <p>“We have captured one suspect, who is now being interrogated. He also belongs to the BRN,” he said.</p>
      <p>Reuters could not immediately reach a representative of the BRN for comment.</p>
      <p>The separatist insurgency in Thailand’s largely ethnic Malay-Muslim provinces of Yala, Pattani, and Narathiwat has killed nearly 7,000 people since 2004, says Deep South Watch, a group that monitors the violence.</p>
      <p>In August, the BRN told Reuters it had held a secret preliminary meeting with the government, but any step toward a peace process appeared to wither after the deputy prime minister rejected a key demand for the release of prisoners.</p>
