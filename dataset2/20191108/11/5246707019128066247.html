      <p>A few hours ago, we shared the news that <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stretchers"><b>The Stretchers</b></a> - a new Nintendo-published game - <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/nintendo_releases_the_stretchers_a_new_co-op_rescue_game_for_switch">appeared out of nowhere on the Japanese eShop</a>. It's now making its way to other regions worldwide (Europe can download it as we write this), and we have a bunch of new screenshots and some extra information to share with you.</p>
      <p>The game is a comedic puzzle co-op title developed by Tarsier Studios and published by Nintendo. You'll find it available on the eShop for £17.99 and it looks to be a rather quirky affair. Here's a description straight from Nintendo, as well as those screenshots we promised:</p>
      <blockquote>Players can take on the role of two medics by sharing Joy-Con with a friend or set off alone to rescue troubled civilians, known as Dizzies, in all kinds of wacky ways.<br/><br/>To rescue Dizzies, players will drive to each scene in their ambulance, and this is where the chaos begins: break through walls, soar through the sky and face other wild perils on the way to each rescue. Once they’ve arrived, players will need to cooperate to pile Dizzies up on their stretcher (or grab them by the limbs) and bring them back to their trusty ambulance, dodging dangers and cracking conundrums along the way. Furniture can be moved to block zapping lasers, wrecking balls can destroy walls, and more. Finally, after another thrill-filled road trip back, rescued Dizzies can be cured, just in time for another call to action!</blockquote>

      <blockquote>Players can pass a Joy-Con to team up with a friend to avoid traps, find bonus treasures and solve puzzles together, all while helping those who need a hand. Solo players can also go it alone, controlling both medics at the same time.<br/><br/>On top of rescuing dizzy citizens in need, the game offers several side missions that span sawing down trees, building ramps, blowing up rocks with fireworks, and even games of hide-and-seek.</blockquote>
