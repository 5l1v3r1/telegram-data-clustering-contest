      <h1>Isko shrugs off death threats</h1>

      <h3>“I’M already made and I have nothing to lose”.</h3>
      <p>This was the reaction of Manila Mayor Isko Moreno who continues to receive threats through text messages while delivering a speech at a forum yesterday in Makati City.</p>
      <p>“These are the kinds of text (messages) na di mo gustong matanggap on a daily basis. May pinarerekisa kasi ako kaya ako nakakatanggap ng ganyang text. Ang sa ‘kin naman, I have nothing to lose kasi galing ako sa wala. Para sa akin, made na ako. Wala na akong mahihiling pa sa Panginoon,” Moreno said.</p>
      <p>When Moreno began implementing his plans to revive  Manila including dismantling of syndicates handling illegal vendors, death threats started to pour in. He simply shrugged them off and continued in his work.</p>
      <p>“Isosoga ko lahat ng aking political capital. Samahan n’yo ko, this is your chance,” the mayor said, saying he remains focused on meaningful programs for the benefit of Manileños.</p>
