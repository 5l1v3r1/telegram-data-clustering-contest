      <h1>BT's Halo Broadband and Mobile Plan is a Thing and it Launches Today</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T11:30:17+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 11:30</time> by <a rel="author">Shabana Arif</a></address>
      <p>BT announced its Halo network <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/10/bt-5g-launch-day-october/">last month</a> and now it's here, even though we forgot all about it.</p>
      <p>BT's MVNO provides mobile, broadband, and phone - the latter being a reference to the archaic practice of maintaining a landline so that cold callers don't go jobless, presumably. It offers unlimited data and calls on mobile and at home, and to make you feel extra fancy and appreciated, customers will have access to a new team of 900 Home Tech Experts. 5G has been tossed in there as well, of course, because this isn't the dark ages.</p>
      <p>"We’ve designed the ultimate converged plan to meet the needs of the modern family," said Pete Oliver, managing director of marketing BT. "Halo really is the best of BT – it offers unlimited, reliable 5G and fibre connectivity, and a host of other great features, including dedicated tech specialists who will come to customers’ homes, aimed at taking the stress away from our customers – and allowing them to spend more time on the things they love. A bonus for those of us who spend needless hours trying to get to grips with home tech issues and wrestling with the connectivity in our homes.”</p>
      <p>BT is going hard on the connectivity angle, dispatching its Smart Hub 2 as part of the package, and - as part of its <i>Keep Connected Promise</i> - if your broadband is playing silly buggers, or you move house and need the internet as soon as you set foot in your new place, BT will send out a 4G Mini Hub to tide you over.</p>
      <p>Halo is available right now, and I imagine you're so excited, you're already scrapping your existing network for the switch over. It's £57.99 per month for new customers, and for once it seems that existing customers will be party to the most tantalising deals, so if you're with BT already, give them a call to "discuss options".</p>
      <p>Oh, and there's a series of pictures of Louise Redknapp 'getting to grips' with all her home tech shit for some reason, so enjoy that.</p>
