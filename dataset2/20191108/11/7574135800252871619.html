      <p><b>Pete Doherty</b> (The Libertines, Babyshambles, etc) has been arrested in Paris for allegedly buying cocaine, according to Paris authorities. <i><a href="https://apnews.com/b504dd1ea2ed49bcb38e921f0118f284">The Associated Press</a></i> report that the Paris prosecutor’s office say Doherty spent Thursday night into Friday in detention after being apprehended during a drug transaction, but wouldn’t confirm reports that he was carrying 2 grams of cocaine, or that the arrest happened in the former red-light district of Pigalle.</p>
      <p>This arrest is one of many drug related offenses Doherty has been collared for since his ascent to fame in the early 2000s, including possession, driving under the influence and with a suspended license, and automobile theft.</p>
      <p>The Libertines are scheduled to begin a European tour later this month, which runs through December; no word has come from the band yet on how Doherty’s arrest could affect those dates.</p>
