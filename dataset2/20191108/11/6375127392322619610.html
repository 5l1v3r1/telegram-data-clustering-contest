      <h3>Authorities will look into the two drugs cases which slain Ilocos Sur regional trial court Judge Mario Anacleto Bañez handled in an attempt to solve his senseless murder.</h3>
      <p>Chief Justice Diosdado Peralta bared this during his first Meet the Press event at the Supreme Court yesterday morning, saying these cases could be the reason why he was assassinated.</p>
      <p>Peralta continued that Bañez’s dismissal of a murder case against a Cordillera health worker as motive was very unlikely.</p>
      <p>Last September, Bañez acquitted Cordillera health worker Rachel Mariano of murder.</p>
      <p>Mariano was accused by the army as a New Peoples Army (NPA) rebel who masterminded an ambush of members of the 81st Infantry Battallion in 2017 in Quirino, Ilocos Sur, where one soldier died.</p>
      <p>In his decision, Bañez condemned the killing, but said: “It would be more deplorable and unfair to convict the accused of all these serious crimes charged against her upon the quality of the evidence adduced by the prosecution.”</p>
