      <p>Cape Town - Third on the Absa Premiership log will play fourth in an epic league encounter on Friday as <b>Bidvest Wits</b> welcome <b>SuperSport United</b> to Bidvest Stadium.</p>
      <p>The hosts go into the game in good spirits having romped past Mozambican club UD Songo 6-0 on aggregate to progress into the CAF Confederation Cup group stages.</p>
      <p>The Clever Boys are still very much in the title race as they have only played six games in the league thus far compared to the ten outings log leader Kaizer Chiefs have had.</p>
      <p>The Students have plenty of ground to make up though as they are 10 points adrift but do have games to make up the points difference.</p>
      <p>SuperSport, meanwhile, will want to get back to winning ways having not won a league match in their last three outings, playing to successive draws.</p>
      <p>Matsatsantsa have faltered of late but they are still up in the goal-scoring department with the strike duo of Bradley Grobler and Thamsanqa Gabuza in good form.</p>
      <p>Aubrey Modiba has also rediscovered his form having netted two goals in his last four matches that has seen him earn a Bafana call-up for the Afcon qualifiers.</p>
      <p>The match will kick off at 19:30.</p>
