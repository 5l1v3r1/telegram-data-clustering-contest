      <p>TOKYO: Japanese authorities have seized a record-breaking 400kg of cocaine worth an estimated US$73 million in a bust at a port in the city of Kobe, a customs spokesman said Friday (Nov 8).</p>
      <p>The discovery in the western city was made last month but came to light on Friday, with officials saying they could not provide additional details because the investigation was ongoing.</p>

      <p>"This is record-breaking, in terms of volume" for a cocaine bust, the spokesman told AFP.</p>
      <p>It far exceeds the previous record set just months earlier in August, when authorities seized 177kg of cocaine at another port, in central Japan's Aichi prefecture.</p>
      <p>It was unclear yet where the cocaine came from, and Kyodo News agency, citing unnamed investigative sources, said the drugs may have been sent to Kobe by mistake.</p>
      <p>Japan has strict drug laws and users face severe public opprobrium if caught.</p>
      <p>Drug use and possession by even moderately famous people, including television actors and little-known athletes, can make national headlines for days.</p>
      <p>Experts warn however that casual drug use among young people is becoming a growing problem.</p>
      <p>Drug sales are a major financial pillar for Japanese organised crimes, including the infamous yakuza.</p>
