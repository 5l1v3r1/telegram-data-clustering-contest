      <p>Paris authorities report that British singer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/petedoherty">Pete Doherty</a> has been arrested in Paris for allegedly buying cocaine.</p>
      <p>The Paris prosecutor’s office said the 40-year-old <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/libertines">Libertines</a> and Babyshambles frontman was placed in detention on Thursday night after being stopped by police during a drugs transaction.</p>
      <p>The office would not comment on French media reports that Doherty was carrying two grams of cocaine and was arrested in Pigalle, an area known for its late-night bars. The Guardian has contacted representatives of Doherty for comment.</p>
      <p>Since rising to fame in the 2000s, Doherty, the former boyfriend of model <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/kate-moss">Kate Moss</a>, has been repeatedly arrested for drug offences.</p>
      <p>The reunited Libertines are preparing for a tour of Europe that starts on 18 November in Brussels. The band has not yet issued information as to whether Doherty’s arrest will affect the forthcoming concerts.</p>
