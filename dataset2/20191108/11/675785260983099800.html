      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T11:06:48+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 11:06</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Kitching, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/chris-kitching/</a></address>
      <p>Hundreds of residents have been forced to flee their homes due to raging <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/floods">floodwater</a> that surged after a month's worth of rain fell in a single day.</p>
      <p>As many as 400 homes in Kirk Sandall, near Doncaster, in South Yorkshire, were evacuated as the River Don burst its banks and reached its highest recorded level.</p>
      <p>A major incident was declared as firefighters brought in boats to rescue residents who were stranded by the rising river, where five severe flood warnings were in place.</p>
      <p>Firefighters in South Yorkshire rescued more than 100 people and received more than 500 emergency calls as the county was hammered by heavy rain for much of Thursday and into Friday morning.</p>

      <p>A spokesman for South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue said: "Our 999 control operators took more than 500 emergency calls- mostly from people trapped in cars or properties.</p>
      <p>"We rescued around 100 people from Parkgate Shopping Centre and neighbouring retail outlets who were stranded by flood water.</p>
      <p>"Most of our other work currently involves providing reassurance to people affected by flooding and moving the most vulnerable to safety as required.</p>
      <p>"It's a multi-agency approach involving partners from other emergency services, local authorities and the Environment Agency."</p>
