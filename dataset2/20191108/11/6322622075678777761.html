      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 8): The Communications and Multimedia Ministry is partnering with Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios (SIE WWS) to establish the global games powerhouse’s very first Southeast Asia studio in Malaysia next year.</p>
      <p>Its Minister, Gobind Singh Deo, said the partnership is a strong recognition of Malaysia as the heart of the games industry in this region.</p>
      <p>“With this establishment, Malaysia will be working closely with SIE WWS to create more opportunities for the local and regional games industry.</p>
      <p>"Together, we will work to uplift the talent pool in Malaysia and even establish a partnership with our local educational partners," he said in his speech at the LEVEL UP KL 2019, Southeast Asia's top industry event for game developers, organised by Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC).</p>
      <p>Gobind said the collaboration with SIE WWS is to ensure the accelerated growth of games industry in the country will be supported.</p>
      <p>Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios Malaysia Sdn Bhd (SIE WWS Malaysia) will provide art and animation services as part of the SIE WWS activities, developing global exclusive titles for PlayStation platforms.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Gobind said a new Digital Creative Ecosystem (DICE) Policy that will focus on strengthening the digital content industry will be rolled out next year.</p>
      <p>“This new policy will focus on strengthening the digital content industry by putting into place initiatives that attract more investments — both local and foreign — to develop and improve local talent and companies,” he said.</p>
      <p>The DICE policy also aims to reinforce the digital content ecosystem and further enable the advancement of market research and new content development while seeking to enhance the export potential of these productions.</p>
      <p>In terms of exports, Gobind said the MSC Malaysia Annual and Quarterly Industry Report reported that games exports grew by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 118 percent to RM681 million between 2014 and 2018.</p>
      <p>The domestic landscape features 53 game studios, many of which are developing local games and creating intellectual properties while also nurturing talent for both local and international projects, said Gobind.</p>
      <p>“There is no doubt that this industry is now a critical driver for our digital economy.</p>
      <p>“More than that, it is the ‘next big thing’ that many of our youths have a keen interest in, in terms of career choices,” he said.</p>
      <p>The annual LEVEL UP KL is part of MDEC’s mandate to spearhead the digital economy in Malaysia through the growth of the nation's games industry.</p>
      <p>The goal is to create a platform for gamers, public, game developers, corporates, and esports, enabling then all to leverage on the biggest entertainment market as a key economic growth driver for the region.</p>
      <p>LEVEL UP KL 2019 is taking place from Nov 2-10, featuring a variety of activities from and for the Southeast Asia games industry and the public.</p>
