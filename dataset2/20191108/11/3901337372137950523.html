          <u>Click through the mini-gallery above to see the three right-sided central midfield options for SA's Real Madrid Dream Team!</u>
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Option 1: Gutierrez Hernandez, aka "Guti" (1995-2010)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Guti joined the Real Madrid academy (La Fabrica) as a youngster and played through the ranks. The technically gifted creative midfielder made his first-team debut in 1995, against Sevilla. His intelligence allowed him to make the game look like fun as he eased past opponents, and his audacious back-heel assists trademarked the type of player he was. Breaking into a star-studded Los Blancos side, he was a rare case of an academy player cementing a spot in the first team at the Santiago Bernabeu. His trophy cabinet is laden with winner's medals, including three UEFA Champions League titles, five LaLiga trophies and a UEFA Super Cup.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Option 2: Zinedine Zidane (2001-2006)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Zidane, a 1998 FIFA World Cup winner, was always a joy to watch and one of best midfielders in the world in his prime. He was one of few players who could control and dictate a football match from the middle of the park. Moving from Juventus to Real in 2001, for a then world-record fee of €75 million (R1.25 billion), his silverware collection, perhaps surprisingly, isn't as impressive as it ought to be. He, too, won multiple trophies during his time in Madrid, namely one UEFA Champions League title, a LaLiga trophy, two Spanish Super Cups and one UEFA Super Cup. To date, many still remember his superb volley against Bayer Leverkusen in the 2001/02 UCL final.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Option 3: Toni Kroos (2014-present)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bayern Munich president Uli Hoeness told <i>Sport Bild</i> earlier this year that his club's sale of Toni Kroos in 2014 was a mistake, and few would argue with him. The Germany star is undeniably one of the world's best midfielders, and one of Real's most important players in recent years. His move to Los Blancos, though relatively understated, helped set the course for Los Blancos' European success over the past few years. To date, the 2014 FIFA World Cup winner has played 245 times for Real so far, scoring 16 goals and assisting another 61 strikes. His trophy cabinet is filled with silverware, including four UEFA Champions League titles, one LaLiga trophy, four UEFA Super Cups and five FIFA Club World Cups.</p>
