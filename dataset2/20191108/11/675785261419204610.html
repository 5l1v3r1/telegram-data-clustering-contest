      <h2>Leicester City face Arsenal knowing three points would put them nine clear of the Gunners in the Champions League race - and heap more pressure on Unai Emery</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T11:55:37+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 11:55</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Richards, https://www.facebook.com/AARichards/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brendan-rodgers">Brendan Rodgers</a> has played down speculation linking him with a move to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> as replacement for Unai Emery.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard is under pressure at the Emirates, and takes his side to the Midlands to face Rodgers’ <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> City on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Victory for the high-flying Foxes, currently third in the Premier League, would see them move nine points clear of the Gunners.</p>
      <p>And Rodgers has played down suggestions he could potentially leave Leicester to take charge in North London, if Emery is dismissed.</p>

      <p>Insisting he is already in a “top job”, Rodgers told <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11712/11857175/leicester-boss-brendan-rodgers-says-he-already-has-a-top-job">Sky Sports:</a> "If you work well, it's a natural consequence of what happens in this game - you'll get linked to other jobs.</p>
      <p>"People link me, at times, to top clubs - I'm already in a top job.</p>
      <p>"This is a fantastic club, a great job for me and in this moment with the ownership we have, the players I have, I'm absolutely loving every minute of it.</p>
      <p>"All the gossip and speculation, whether it's for you or against you, is part of the game.”</p>

      <p>Arsenal have won just one of their last six games in all competitions.</p>
      <p>And they will face Leicester without Dani Ceballos, who picked up a hamstring problem in the 1-1 Europa League draw with Vitoria Guimaraes on Wednesday night.</p>

      <p>That could allow <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/granit-xhaka">Granit Xhaka</a> to return in midfield, with the Swiss having been stripped of the captaincy following his “f*** off” outburst at fans.</p>
      <p>Also, with continued questions about Mesut Ozil's long-term future continuing to be asked, Rodgers admits he understands the difficulties Emery is currently going through.</p>
      <p>When you're a manager you always have empathy for another manager," he added. "You understand the pressures, you understand the climate we work in.</p>
      <p>"But as a manager you really focus on what you can control. Unai is a proven coach, he's an experienced coach, so he'll be focusing on the performance of the team and not get involved in all the background noise that goes on."</p>
      <p>Leicester striker Jamie Vardy has been named Premier League player of the month for October.</p>
