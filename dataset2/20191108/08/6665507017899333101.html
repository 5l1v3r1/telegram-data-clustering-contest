      <p>Actor-turned-political <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/rajinikanth/">Rajinikanth</a> said on Friday that the <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/tag/bjp/">BJP</a> had made efforts to to paint him “saffron” and that he, like an ancient Tamil poet Thiruvallur, would not fall for it. He was referring to the BJP releasing a photo of Tiruvalluvar in saffron clothes that created controversy.  </p>
      <p><i>PTI</i> quoted Rajinikanth as saying, “No offer has been made (from BJP to join the party)... definitely not. Attempts are being made to paint me with BJP colour...  trying to paint me with saffron like Thiruvalluvar was done with.. Neither Thiruvalluvar nor I will get trapped.” </p>

      <p>The actor clarified that while certain parts of the media were trying to insinuate that he would join the BJP, it was a decision that he needed to make. </p>
      <p>“Some people and media are trying to give an impression that I am a BJP man. This isn’t true. Any political party will be happy if anyone joins them. But it is on me to take a decision,” <i>ANI</i> quoted him as saying. </p>

      <p>When asked about senior BJP leader Pon Radhakrishnan’s recent meeting with him and the former’s repeated assertions that the actor should join the party, Rajinikanth said no such has invitation has been made to him.</p>
      <p>“No offer has been made (from BJP to join the party)..</p>
      <p>definitely not,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Attempts are being made to paint me with BJP colour..</p>
      <p>trying to paint me with saffron like Thiruvalluvar was done with.. Neither Thiruvalluvar nor me will get trapped,” he said with a big laugh.</p>
      <p>On November 1, the BJP’s Tamil Nadu unit on its Twitter handle had written a couplet from Thiruvalluvar’s classic “Thirukkural,” questioning the use of education if the Almighty was not worshipped.</p>
      <p>Tagging the couplet, the saffron party targeted the Dravidar Kazhagam, DMK and the Left parties for allegedly deriding God and for berating believers and questioned “what is the use of their education.”</p>
      <p>Also, the party had posted a picture of Thiruvalluvar in saffron robes with sacred ash on his forehead.</p>
