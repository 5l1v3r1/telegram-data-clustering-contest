      <h1>Gini Wijnaldum responds to "strange" Pep Guardiola diving comments on Sadio Mane</h1>
      <h2>Liverpool's Dutch midfielder says that it was a little odd that the Manchester City manager opted to single out Mane ahead of Sunday's titanic clash at Anfield</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T08:51:17+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 08:51</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mark-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Gini Wijnaldum says he finds it "strange" that Pep Guardiola would choose to single out Sadio Mane for diving criticism ahead of Manchester City's trip to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The City boss <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/pep-guardiola-aims-dig-sadio-20798235">chose to speak about Mane</a> in the immediate aftermath of his side's 2-1 win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> last Saturday, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/man-city-boss-pep-guardiola-20818956">although he later backtracked</a> .</p>
      <p>Mane had just scored a last-gasp winner for Liverpool at Aston Villa on the same afternoon, but he was also booked for diving in the first half of that clash at Villa Park.</p>
      <p>The Senegalese has won penalties in Liverpool's recent victories over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> , but Wijnaldum says that with VAR in place this season then there is no place for "divers" to hide anyway.</p>

      <p>“I heard what he (Guardiola) said,” the midfielder told reporters, via <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/wijnaldum-questions-guardiolas-strange-diving-claims/1rzowugiavhw117zzwubefy0y6">Goal.com</a> .</p>
      <p>“He gave his opinion about us and the way he thinks. Nothing bad in that. That is his opinion. In his opinion Sadio is a diver. What can you say about that?</p>
      <p>“I didn’t see the Villa one back, so it’s difficult to give my opinion on that, but I can’t remember Sadio doing it before. Now we have VAR as well, so…</p>

      <p>“How many players of ours have had a yellow card for diving? Sadio was the first, I think? So to say that we are divers, I think it’s a little bit strange. That’s my opinion.”</p>
      <p>Wijnaldum - who scored Liverpool's opening goal in their 2-1 win over Genk in the Champions League in midweek - is looking forward to facing City, who could look to stage a repeat of last season's Anfield tactics as they contained the hosts on the way to a 0-0 draw.</p>

      <p>“Maybe they will play different,” he added.</p>
      <p>“I think it suits every team if it is a more open game, but it is also a sign of respect if they play differently.”</p>
      <p>The Reds would go nine points clear of Guardiola's side with a win.</p>
