      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ashley-graham">Ashley Graham</a> has revealed the sex and due date of her baby for the first time. </p>
      <p>On Thursday, the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/sports-illustrated"><i>Sports Illustrated</i></a> model appeared on <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/the-ellen-degeneres-show"><i>The Ellen Show</i></a> to discuss her <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Pregnancy">pregnancy</a> when presenter <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/EllenDeGeneres">Ellen DeGeneres</a> suggested the pair play a version of “Lightning Round” – a game Graham plays on her podcast, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/pretty-big-deal-with-ashley-graham/id1437469957"><i>Pretty Big Deal</i></a>, which involves guests answering a round of rapid-fire questions.</p>
      <p>While Graham is usually the one asking questions, DeGeneres decided to switch roles and put the model in the hot seat. </p>
      <p>DeGeneres began by asking Graham a series of trivial questions including “besides your husband, who do you have a crush on?” and “what has been your most embarrassing wardrobe malfunction?”</p>
      <p>However, in the final seconds of the game, DeGeneres asked: “Are you having a boy or a girl?”</p>
      <p>Graham promptly responded: “I’m having a boy! I’m gonna be a mummy to a boy!”</p>
      <p>The model also revealed details of her due date, saying the baby was due in “January sometime” but that she had been told it could arrive early or late.</p>
      <p>When DeGeneres asked if the baby could be born around the same time as her birthday, which falls on 26 January, Graham added: “A little before”. </p>
      <p>The 32-year-old <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/ashley-graham-pregnant-baby-first-child-instagram-video-husband-justin-ervin-a9058436.html">announced that she was expecting her first child</a> with husband, Justin Ervin, in August.</p>
      <p>The couple, who have been married for nine years, celebrated their wedding anniversary in a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B1JWcqCgUSI/">video</a> of themselves on <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/instagram">Instagram</a>.</p>
      <p>In the clip, the pair could be seen adjusting the camera’s focus before zooming out to show Ervin caressing Graham’s baby bump. </p>
      <p>“Surprise,” the pair say in unison, before sharing a kiss.</p>

      <p>In the caption to the post, Graham wrote: “Nine years ago today, I married the love of my life. It has been the best journey with my favourite person in the world!</p>
      <p>“Today, we are feeling so blessed, grateful and excited to celebrate with our GROWING FAMILY! Happy anniversary, @mrjustinervin. Life is about to get even better. [sic]"</p>
