      <p>NEW DELHI: Amid rising concern about their future, Air India chairman <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ashwani-Lohani">Ashwani Lohani</a> on Friday assured employees of the cash-starved and divestment-bound airline that their interests will be taken care of. He told Air Indians that divestment could be a “viable alternative for sustainable survival.”</p>
      <p>The Modi government is soon going to make a second attempt to sell off the airline which has a total debt-cum-payables burden of close to Rs 72,000 crore after a failed move last year.</p>
      <p>“AI has been going through an extremely stretched financial situation, primarily due to huge debt servicing liabilities that has been affecting the airline…. It is but natural that many of you would be concerned about the future in light of the disinvestment scenario as any change in ownership brings about changes in the work culture and environment. Kindly rest assured that the management fully shares your concerns and is taking necessary steps to protect the genuine interests of all Air Indians. There is however absolutely no cause for any undue concern,” Lohani said in the letter to employees.</p>

      <p>He urged employees to ensure that the AI “brand, the most well-known Indian brand across the globe, retains its sheen even in the present testing times.” Lohani told employees why it is difficult for a commercial enterprise facing intense competition from nimble private sector players to survive in government ownership.</p>
      <p>“(AI’s financial) position gets compounded due to lega cy issues and the constraining environment that being a PSU (public sector undertaking), we are forced to live with. Being an airline we function in a highly competitive environment, an environment in which our competitors are not constrained by the procedures restrictions and oversight that we at Air India face placing us at a handicap both financially as well as operationally,” Lohani’s letter says.</p>
      <p>“You would appreciate that the above scenario constrains our sustainable survival with disinvestment perhaps emerging as a viable alternative. It may enable sustainability as well as help in attaining the full inherent potential of the national carrier, thereby also helping the nation in attaining its economic goals. At this juncture, despite considerable constraints, it is essential that Air Indians as always continue to put in their best efforts in their area of responsibility,” he added.</p>
