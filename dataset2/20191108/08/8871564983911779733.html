      <p>In a rare spot of good news, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) today announced that 134 <i>Noche Buena</i> products — or food items typically bought for a festive spread on Christmas Eve — will remain the same price as last year, while six products will actually decrease in price.</p>

      <p>Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez <a href="https://www.dti.gov.ph/media/latest-news/13330-no-price-hike-for-134-noche-buena-products-6-products-have-decreased-prices-dti-chief?fbclid=IwAR2I87OVBfLbNCl8Lfpipp73AzxWWUIEkiwfkeg9sxeoo1Qd08s4ZS2Fn4U">said</a> that 134 brands, which include <i>queso de bola</i> (Christmas Edam) and other cheeses, sandwich spread, mayonnaise, and various dried pastas and pasta sauces, have maintained the same prices as last year. He added that certain other cheeses, pastas, and tomato sauces would actually drop in price.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Going on to tell Filipinos several things they already knew, Lopez advised that when shopping for Noche Buena, consumers should prepare a shopping list (good idea!), that they should buy products at supermarkets monitored by the DTI (okaayyy), and that they should look for promo bundle packs or those that combine several Noche Buena products in one (who’d have thought?!).</p>
      <p>Finally, putting the icing on the obvious cake, Lopez added that people should “look for products that are not expiring soon.” (Duh.)</p>
