      <h2>WARNING: CONTAINS NUDITY AND GRAPHIC CONTENT - Comedian Duckie L'Orange shocked the judges on Das Supertalent with her X-rated act</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T08:46:21+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 08:46</time> by <a rel="author">Vicki Newman, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/vicki-newman/</a></address>
      <p>A comedian appearing on the German version of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/britains-got-talent">Britain's Got Talent</a> left judges horrified when she ate a string of sausages with her bum.</p>
      <p>The X-rated act left the Das Supertalent judges and audience so shocked they turned away and covered their eyes.</p>
      <p>People couldn't believe what they were seeing when act Duckie L'Orange dropped her trousers and turn round to reveal the face of a dog drawn onto her back and bottom.</p>
      <p>She sat down on the stage and shuffled backwards to a string of sausages that she'd placed front and centre.</p>
      <p>Duckie then appeared to gobble up the sausages with her bum - or the dog's face - while the judges screamed in horror and turned away, refusing to watch.</p>

      <p>One of the judges, model Bruce Darnell, was so shocked he ran off from his desk and into the audience, muttering "Oh my God" repeatedly.</p>
      <p>Fellow judge Sylvie Meis, a Dutch TV star, gasped in horror and covered her mouth, while musician Dieter Bohlen immediately turned his back before slipping off his chair and ducking under his desk.</p>
      <p>Duckie L'Orange, describes herself on her website as "a Berlin based performance artist with a twist".</p>

      <p>She also describes herself as a children's performer.</p>
      <p>Her bio reads: "She does weird and wacky interactive performances for kids, and equally wacky but significantly dirtier shows for adults."</p>
      <p>Duckie boasts skills including puppetry, children's entertainment and burlesque.</p>
      <p>The German show is one of many international spin-offs of Simon Cowell's Britain's Got Talent.</p>

      <p>Many contestants on the British version of the show have gone for the shock factor before, but an act quite like this has never made it onto the programme.</p>
      <p>Among the most outrageous British acts have been topless burlesque performers and daredevils risking their lives for entertainment.</p>
