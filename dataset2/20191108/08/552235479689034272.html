      <p>It’s been one of the nation’s favourite shops for decades, but on Tuesday, <a href="https://fave.co/2OAlxlk">Mothercare</a> went into administration and announced it is closing all its remaining stores across the UK.</p>
      <p>Customers can expect to find a huge range of discounts and bargains in stores and online as all stock must go.</p>
      <p>According to store management, stock levels are high as warehouses are cleared, so there is plenty of choice and shoppers are advised to take advantage of the heavy discounts as soon as possible.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://fave.co/2OAlxlk">website</a> will remain live until further notice and discounts will also be available online as long as the website is live.</p>
      <p>Any product warranties or guarantees will remain valid and customers are encouraged to spend any gift cards as soon as possible. </p>
      <p>Gift cards will no longer be available to purchase.</p>
      <p><a href="https://fave.co/2OAlxlk">Mothercare</a> has been the UK's number one retailer for prams, pushchairs, car seats, baby clothes, maternity clothes, nursery furniture, toys and gifts and has been a staple on the high street since 1961.</p>
