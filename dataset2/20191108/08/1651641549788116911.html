      <p>Microsoft <a href="https://twitter.com/bojorchess/status/1192653905504530433">Program Manager Roberto Bojorquez announced the feature</a> on twitter, saying if you reply to a message with a single emoji, this will now be of a much larger size.</p>
      <p>The feature is currently rolling out to 50% Windows 10 Insiders who are also using the Your Phone app with Android handsets.</p>
      <p>Microsoft has been rapidly polishing the Your Phone app, and besides big emojis in the Your Phone, Microsoft is also adding the ability to <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/your-phone-app-will-soon-support-making-calls-from-your-desktop/">make and take phone calls using your desktop</a>, the <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/your-phone-now-allows-you-to-preview-images-within-the-app/">ability to preview pictures in full size</a> and of course the ability to control your phone directly.</p>
