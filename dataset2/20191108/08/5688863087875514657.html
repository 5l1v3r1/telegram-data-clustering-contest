        <b>Australia wicketkeeper Peter Handscomb has been roped in for a two-year deal by Middlesex county. The 28-year-old has played 40 international games so far and will captain the English county side for the next two seasons across both the County Championship and one-day competitions.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Handscomb, the current captain of the Victoria cricket team, has been involved with county cricket stints in England before. He has represented Gloucestershire in 2015, Yorkshire in 2017 and played for <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/team/durham_county">Durham county</a> in 2019. </p>
      <p>As captain of Victoria, the 28-year-old has led the team to three titles and now as captain of Middlesex, is expected to be available for the entire season.</p>
      <p>Middlesex head coach Stuart Law said in an official statement, on Thursday, that Handscomb is a great person to captain the side as he has personally worked with Peter at the National Cricket Centre in Brisbane and looking at his success as captain could be an asset for Middlesex.</p>
      <p>“I have known Peter for some time and worked with him at the National Cricket Centre in Brisbane seven or eight years ago, so I know what a top bloke he is,” stated Law, as quoted by Sportstar.</p>
      <p>“Peter is a fine player and he will fill a couple of the gaps that have been created. He is a successful captain, a fine middle-order player and the sort of character who will help create a strong positive environment that will keep moving the club forward”</p>
