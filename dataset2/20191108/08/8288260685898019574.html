      <h1>'Massive asset' - Aston Villa sent Rangers transfer warning</h1>
      <h2>Aston Villa transfer news | Dean Smith's side have been heavily linked with Ibrox hot-shot and now they have been sent a warning by the Scottish Premiership side</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T08:50:44+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 08:50</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Cusack</a></address>
      <p>Rangers boss Steven Gerrard has lavished praise on Aston Villa target Alfredo Morelos.</p>
      <p>The Colombian hotshot fired in his latest goal of the campaign in a 2-0 defeat of FC Porto in the Europa League last night.</p>
      <p>Rangers striker Morelos netted after 69 minutes and then set up Steven Davis, who put the game to bed and his side three points clear of Feyenoord in third place, level with Group G table-toppers Young Boys.</p>
      <p>Morelos has been heavily linked with <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> ahead of the January transfer window, the 23-year-old's fine form reportedly attracting suitors in the Premier League and abroad.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/rangers-receive-aston-villa-transfer-17220994">has scored 21 goals in 25 matches in all competitions</a> , adding seven for his team-mates, so it's easy to see why Gerrard is so keen to keep hold of his star man.</p>
      <p>"I loved the play before it, Tav (James Tavernier) being positive, sliding and getting the ball to Jacko when he was second favourite to get there," Gerrard said.</p>
      <p>"I liked that Jacko didn't cross early, he showed composure and picked out the pass.</p>
      <p>"But the touch and finish was stunning. That's the reason we talk about him every two or three days.</p>
