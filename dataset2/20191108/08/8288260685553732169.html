      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T08:42:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 08:42</time> by <a rel="author">Steve Wollaston, https://www.facebook.com/stevewollastonjournalist/</a></address>
      <p>The latest news in the world of Wolves transfers and elsewhere in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>In what is fast becoming the 2019 version of 'Andre Silva to Wolverhampton Wanderers', AC Milan midfielder Franck Kessie has once again been linked with a switch to Molineux.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> were extensively linked with the 22-year-old in the most recent window, with some claims suggesting Kessie turned down a move to the Black Country.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Despite that deal not getting over the line, reports in Italy still suggest that Wolves bosses could be planning another San Siro raid in the new year.</p>
      <p>Kessie's former Rossoneri teammate Patrick Cutrone arrived on WV1 last summer, where despite his popularity with the fervent fanbase, he was deemed surplus to requirements.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>And now Kessie, who initially arrived in Milan in 2017, could face a similar fate, with the Italian giants looking to further boost their own transfer coffers.</p>
      <p>Mediaset, as relayed by <a href="https://www.calciomercato.it/news/356187/milan_ritorno_di_fiamma_per_kessie_ecco_la_cifra">Calciomercato,</a> have claimed that Wolves 'are back in love' with the Ivorian and will again try and bring him to the club in 2020.</p>
      <p>Kessie has been a regular starter this season but it is reported that a bid of €25m could be enough to see a move 'really materialise in the coming months'.</p>

      <h3>Elsewhere in the Premier League </h3>
      <p>Red Bull Salzburg are reportedly looking to land a €100million (£86m) fee for star striker Erling Braut Haaland.</p>
      <p>The Norwegian wonderkid has been linked with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> and other top European clubs after his stunning breakthrough this season.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old ace, son of former Leeds and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> star Alf-Inge, has already bagged 12 goals in 11 Austrian top flight games as well as six in three in the Champions League to alert more than 20 clubs.</p>
      <p>Whilst the Austrian champions have publicly declared they do not intend to sell Haaland, Italian newspaper <a href="https://www.tuttosport.com/news/calcio/serie-a/juventus/2019/11/05-63041782/juve-haaland_il_salisburgo_vuole_100_milioni_e_asta_con_real_e_united/?a=2">Tuttosport</a> claim they are already putting out feelers to interested parties.</p>
      <p>They claim that the club are willing to encourage a huge transfer battle as they demand a massive fee for the youngster, knowing top clubs could enter a bidding war.</p>
      <h4>Timo time?</h4>
      <p>Liverpool could strengthen their fearsome forward line by swooping for Timo Werner in January, according to Emile Heskey.</p>
      <p>Reds boss Jurgen Klopp opted not to sign senior players in the summer following the Reds' Champions League triumph.</p>
      <p>But Heskey reckons Klopp must spend in the new year as he bids to keep his side ahead of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> in the race for the Premier League title.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/timo-werner">Werner</a> has been linked with both <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> , and the 23-year-old centre-forward has scored eight goals in all competitions for RB Leipzig this season.</p>
      <p>Liverpool of course have Sadio Mane, Mo Salah and Roberto Firmino as their first-choice forwards, as well as Divock Origi and Rhian Brewster as back-up.</p>
      <h4>Havertz</h4>
      <p>Manchester United are weighing up a sensational £80million move for Bayer Leverkusen forward Kai Havertz.</p>
      <p>German midfielder Havertz is expected to be one of next summer's hottest transfer properties after admitting that he may be willing to depart the club for pastures new at the end of this season.</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old has previously been linked with interest from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> as well as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> and Borussia Dortmund.</p>
      <p>And under-pressure United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is seemingly desperate to pip his rivals to Havertz's signature, having identified a right-sided midfielder as his No.1 priority.</p>
      <p>West Ham and Newcastle fight for striker</p>
      <p>Premier League duo West Ham and Newcastle United are set to battle in the transfer market for the services of Genk striker Mbwana Samatta, the BBC reports.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old scored in the Belgian side’s 2-1 defeat to Liverpool in the Champions League this week and reportedly has a release clause of around just £10m in his deal.</p>
      <p>An international for Tanzania, Samatta has netted six goals in 13 league matches this term and struck 25 goals last year as Genk won the title.</p>
      <h4>Chelsea prepared to sell three veterans</h4>
      <p>Chelsea are ready to shuffle their deck in the January transfer window by allowing Olivier Giroud, Marcos Alonso and Pedro to leave Stamford Bridge, the Daily Mail states.</p>
      <p>The trio have all struggled for first-team opportunities so far this season, with both Giroud and Pedro able to discuss contracts with foreign clubs in the New Year ahead of their contract expiry at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>Alonso, meanwhile, has seen his future come under speculation amid continued links suggesting the Blues will move for Leicester City’s Ben Chillwell.</p>
      <h4>Ajax star open to Premier League switch</h4>
      <p>Ajax star Quincy Promes has opened the door to the Premier League after catching the eye in his side’s dramatic 4-4 Champions League draw with Chelsea, the Mirror reports.</p>
      <p>Liverpool and Arsenal have both previously been attributed with an interest in the Netherlands international and, despite only returning to his homeland in the summer from Sevilla, is open to a Premier League switch.</p>
      <p>"To me, if I have a chance, maybe in the future,” he told reporters after the game.</p>
      <h4>Chelsea backed to sign Leicester defender</h4>
      <p>Leicester City defender Ben Chilwell has been tipped to complete a transfer to the Foxes’ top-four rivals Chelsea by Darren Bent, Leicester Live reports.</p>
      <p>Currently under a transfer ban, Chelsea have appealed for the ban to be overturned and, if successful, Bent believes that Chillwell would be the ideal recruit.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know how much money they’re going to have if this ban is overturned, but if they can go and get Ben Chilwell I think that’s really the only position where you’d say ‘well, if we can strengthen somewhere, it will be there.’”</p>
      <h4>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</h4>
      <p>Arsenal have reportedly promised Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang they will listen to offers if he decides he wants to leave the club.</p>
      <p>Aubameyang is yet to commit his long-term future to the Gunners and reports suggest he will consider moving on at the end of the season if they cannot secure a return to Champions League football.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://eldesmarque.com/madrid/real-madrid/noticias/174929-florentino-perez-mete-a-james-rodriguez-en-la-operacion-ultima-hora-en-el-real-madrid-ed">El Desmarque</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> president Florentino Perez is keen on a £69million move for the Gabonese striker, with the possibility of including James Rodriguez in a swap deal to lower the price.</p>
      <p>And they claim <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> chiefs have told Aubayemang they will be open to offers if he decides his future lies elsewhere.</p>
