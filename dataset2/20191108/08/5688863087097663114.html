        <b>England has recalled wicket-keeper batsman Jonny Bairstow to replace Joe Denly, who has been ruled out due with a damaged ankle, for the upcoming two-match Test series in New Zealand. The white-ball English side is currently battling the hosts in an ongoing five-match T20I series.</b>
      </p>
      <p>England are currently touring New Zealand for a limited-overs tournament, which will be followed by a two-match Test series, starting on November 21. The five-match T20I series ends on Sunday, November 10, and Englandâ€™s Test squad has already arrived in Auckland this week. The red-ball specialists will join the rest of the squad on Monday. There will be two practice matches held ahead of the Test series spanning from November 12-November 17.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Denly has not played since he damaged his right ankle ligaments in training a little over two weeks ago. While he did join the net practice on Thursday, the 30-year-old has not been declared fit yet. Consequently, Bairstow - who due to a lack of runs in a drawn Ashes series- was called back to join the team in New Zealand.</p>
