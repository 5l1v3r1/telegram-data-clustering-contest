      <p>Huawei’s daughter company, Honor, just released a new variant of their latest smart TV series. The Honor Vision TV lineup now comes in a 4GB RAM variant which will go on sale with a starting price of 3799 Yuan, which is just around $550 or 490€.</p>

      <p>The RAM upgrade will be available both for the Basic version and the Pro one. Meanwhile the amount of storage is 32GB on the first and 64GB on the latter. Along with the increase of RAM, on November 11 the TVs will also receive new software features such as AI Fitness, AI Kids, Child Mode and many more.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile the older model with 2GB of RAM will drop its price to a mere 2999 Yuan ($430 or 388€). It’ll also get 12 months interest-free instalments and a 3-year warranty.</p>
      <p>For those who have missed the official launch, we’d like to remind you that Honor’s Vision TV series is the first ever device to equip Huawei’s Harmony OS. Plus it does that using home-developed chips such as the Honghu 818, NPU and Hi1103 Wi-Fi module.</p>

      <p>The Vision TV series also pioneered a system-level video calling function, creating a “new way” to communicate between smartphones and TVs. While on the smart TV side we have total control with voice commands and a totally ads-free operative system.</p>
      <p>Finally, hardware wise, the Honor Vision TV Pro comes with a large 55-inch panel. With a full-screen design and a 94% screen to body ratio. We then find a 6.9mm ultra-thin body and a hidden camera that pop-ups at the top when indeed. There are also six 10W speakers for a more immersive sound experience.</p>
