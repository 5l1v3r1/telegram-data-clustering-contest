        <b>The Welsh Tories have said they are "deeply sorry" for the circumstances around a collapsed rape trial involving a former aide to Alun Cairns.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ross England caused the case's collapse when he gave evidence a judge had ruled inadmissible.</p>
      <p>Eight months later he was selected to stand for the Conservatives in the 2021 Welsh Assembly elections.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman said the party was sorry for the distress caused to the victim at the centre of the trial.</p>
      <p>A row over what Mr Cairns knew about the collapse of the court case <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-50302173">led to his decision to quit as Welsh secretary on Wednesday</a>.</p>
      <p>Mr England <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-50225606">had been accused by a crown court judge of sabotage</a>.</p>
      <p>The defendant James Hackett, a friend of Mr England's, was subsequently convicted of rape at a retrial.</p>

      <p>On Thursday morning Lord Davies of Gower, who has been the chairman of the party in Wales since 2017, said he "deeply regrets" the situation has arisen but added: "There will be an apology if I find out that one should be forthcoming."</p>
      <p>Following the interview a statement was sent to BBC Wales in which a party spokeswoman said: "We are deeply sorry for the circumstances surrounding the collapse of the trial and the deep distress this must have caused the victim, her family and friends.</p>
      <p>"Mr England has been suspended from the party and a full investigation is under way.</p>
      <p>"We are proud to support the many women who work for or engage with our party and employ a strict ethical code for staff and volunteers as part of our human resource strategy."</p>
      <p>In evidence to the April 2018 trial Mr England made claims of a casual sexual relationship with the victim, which she has denied.</p>
      <p>The judge Stephen John Hopkins had earlier told the trial that evidence of the sexual history of the victim was inadmissible.</p>
      <p>He told Mr England: "You have managed single-handed, and I have no doubt it was deliberate on your part, to sabotage this trialâ€¦ get out of my court."</p>

      <p>Mr Cairns, the Conservative general election candidate for the Vale of Glamorgan, had claimed he did not know about Mr England's involvement in the collapse of the trial until last week.</p>
      <p>He resigned from the cabinet after BBC Wales obtained <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-50302173">an email from August 2018</a> that had been sent to him discussing the case.</p>
      <p>In his resignation letter Mr Cairns said: "I will co-operate in full with the investigation under the ministerial code which will now take place and I am confident I will be cleared of any breach or wrong doing."</p>
      <p>David TC Davies, the party's candidate for Monmouth, said he did not believe Mr England should be eligible to stand as a candidate for the Welsh assembly elections.</p>
      <p>Other candidates standing in the Vale of Glamorgan include Belinda Loveluck-Edwards for Welsh Labour and Anthony Slaughter for the Wales Green Party.</p>
      <p>The close of nominations is 14 November.</p>
