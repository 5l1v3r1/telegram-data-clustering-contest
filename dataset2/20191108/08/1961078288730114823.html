      <h3>The President Doth Protest</h3>
      <p>On Thursday, The Washington Post reported that Attorney General William P. Barr declined President Trump’s request to hold a news conference in order to say that the president had not broken any laws in his July call to Ukraine. Trump angrily tweeted in response, denying there was any truth to the story.</p>

      <blockquote>“Bill Barr refused to publicly defend the president? Something is seriously wrong. That’s like Nicolas Cage turning down a movie role.” <i>— STEPHEN COLBERT<br/></i><br/><br/>“In a series of rage tweets this morning, he wrote ‘A fake Washington Post con job.’ ‘Totally untrue and just another fake news story,’ ‘lowlife reporters,’ ‘pure fiction’ from a ‘garbage newspaper.’ He said this ‘never happened’ and there were ‘no sources,’ which means it definitely happened and there are multiple sources.” <i>— JIMMY KIMMEL<br/></i><br/><br/>“Of course, there’s only one way to make sure a story about Trump is true, and that’s if he rage-tweets his denial: ‘Bill Barr did not decline my request to talk about Ukraine. The story was a fake Washington Post con job with an ‘anonymous’ source that doesn’t exist. Just read the transcript. The Justice Department already ruled that the call was good. We don’t have freedom of the press!’ I’m not sure what to make of that last sentence. Is that a complaint or is that a new executive order?<i> [imitating Trump]</i> ‘We don’t have freedom of the press. Write that down. While we’re at it, we’re also getting rid of that one where we can’t covet other people’s wives. Have you seen that chick Jared’s with? Exactly my type.” <i>— STEPHEN COLBERT</i></blockquote>

      <h3>The Punchiest Punchlines (Foistered Edition)</h3>
      <blockquote>“Donald Trump is nothing if not a pioneer of the English language. You might think he’s just making up words or doesn’t know how to read. But that is not the case, you see. Trump doesn’t make errors; he makes discoveries — he’s like a scholar. He spends all night scouring obscure 15th century medieval texts looking for previously unknown words. <i>[as Trump]</i> ‘Eureka, I’ve found it! ‘Lawmakers.’’ And recently, Dr. Trump has made yet another profound linguistic discovery.” <i>— SETH MEYERS<br/></i><br/><br/>“‘Foistered.’ And it wasn’t just like a slip of the tongue because he did it again on Tuesday in Lexington and Friday in Tupelo. He used the word ‘foistered’ three times in a week. It’s a combination of ‘foisted’ and ‘forced,’ which also happen to be his two favorite ways to meet women.” <i>— JIMMY KIMMEL<br/></i><br/><br/>“That’s right, ‘foistered.’ He sounds like Daffy Duck trying to say faster. <i>[as Daffy Duck]</i> Foister! Foister! The Democrats are after us!’” <i>— SETH MEYERS<br/></i><br/><br/>“Trump is surrounded — surrounded by so many sycophants that no one was willing to tell him ‘foistered’ is not a word, so he used it twice. Soon, his underlings are going to start using it, too. <i>[as Trump underling]</i> ‘This administration is moving foister and foister than any administration in history, but we’re being stonewalled by Democratic ‘lawmakers.’’” <i>— SETH MEYERS</i></blockquote>
