      <p>BEIJING -- A Chinese maker of rabies vaccine that was fined 9.1 billion yuan (US$1.3 billion) in a quality scandal that set off a crackdown on the industry said Friday it has been declared bankrupt.</p>
      <p>Changchun Changsheng Life Sciences Ltd., which lost its production licenses last year, said in a statement that a court issued the ruling after concluding the company was insolvent and couldn't pay its debts.</p>
      <p>Revelations that authorities failed to act immediately after finding the company might have falsified production records led to an outcry among a public already upset over deaths and injuries due to fake or shoddy medicines, milk, toys and other products.</p>
      <p>Changsheng Life Sciences used expired materials, mixed different batches of products and failed to test them properly, according to regulators. The company destroyed records to conceal its misconduct, they said.</p>
      <p>The country's No. 2 leader, Premier Li Keqiang, said the company "violated a moral bottom line."</p>
      <p>No injuries were reported but authorities recalled the company's products from China and foreign markets.</p>
      <p>Rabies is endemic in parts of China.</p>
