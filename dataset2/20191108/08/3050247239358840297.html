      <h1>Ethereum Istanbul Hard Fork Release Date Confirmed By Core Developer</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T08:17:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 08:17</time> by <a rel="author">Marie Huillet</a></address>
      <p>Team lead at the Ethereum (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price-index">ETH</a>) Foundation Péter Szilágyi has confirmed Dec. 4 as the expected date for the network’s forthcoming Istanbul hard fork.</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/peter_szilagyi/status/1192360910314262529?s=20">two</a> tweets posted on Nov. 7, Szilágyi indicated that Istanbul will commence at block 9069000. He provided Geth mainnet node operators with a link to a <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/releases/tag/v1.9.7">new maintenance release</a> designed to begin the hard fork’s initialization. </p>
      <p>Geth is the name given to one of the two most popular clients used to <a href="https://docs.ethhub.io/using-ethereum/running-an-ethereum-node/">operate nodes</a> on the Ethereum network — the other being Parity, which will update upon the activation of Istanbul but is now in the review stage.</p>
      <h3>Ethereum gets closer to 2.0</h3>
      <p>Following the Constantinople upgrade — which was completed in February of this year —  Istanbul represents the latest hard fork in the network’s eventual transition to Ethereum 2.0, dubbed Berlin, intended to be Ethereum’s final upgrade which is set to take place in 2020.</p>
      <p>Berlin’s most significant feature is rumoured to be the implementation of a new programmatic proof-of-work (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/pow">PoW</a>) algorithm dubbed “ProgPoW,” which is intended to combat the advantage that ASIC miners have on the network.</p>
      <p>“ASIC” refers to mining hardware that uses Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/asic">ASIC</a>) chips, which are tailored to efficiently mine cryptocurrency based on a specific hashing algorithm.</p>
      <p>By contrast, set-ups that use graphics processing units (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/gpu">GPU</a>s) are less specialized, and have therefore <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bear-market-and-declining-hashrates-mean-mining-eth-no-longer-profitable-analysis-finds">to date struggled</a> to compete for rewards on the network with those that deploy ASICs.</p>
      <p>Ethereum’s developers decided to split the implementation of Istanbul into two stages, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereums-istanbul-hard-fork-implementation-delayed-to-early-october">beginning</a> with a version that included a selection of six Ethereum Improvement Proposals (<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/">EIPs</a>) for <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/early-arrival-of-ethereums-istanbul-hard-fork-causes-testnet-split">testnet integration</a> in October. </p>
      <h3>Aragon DAO platform declare opposition to Istanbul </h3>
      <p>Earlier this month, community members of Aragon — an open-source software project for creating Ethereum-based decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) — <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/aragon-opposes-change-to-ethereums-mining-algorithm-before-20-version">proclaimed</a> themselves against the protocol’s shift to ProgPow.</p>
      <p>Aragon One CTO Jorge Izquierdo had <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/aragon-expects-ethereums-istanbul-hard-fork-to-break-680-smart-contracts">indicated</a> in late October that Istanbul would result in breaking of roughly 680 smart contracts on the Aragon platform, stating:</p>
      <blockquote>“The issue we’re going to have hasn’t been deemed important enough for this hard fork not to happen, which from our point of view is unfortunate [but] it’s a hard balance we understand.”</blockquote>
