        <b>Ross Brawn has admitted rule changes cannot keep being blocked by Formula 1 teams in the future after the idea for a reverse-grid qualifying races was dismissed by two F1 teams.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The idea of the reverse-grid qualifying races for just three races of the 2020 Formula 1 calendar was "blocked completely" by two unnamed F1 teams recently and this has left the motorsport director of the sport very frustrated.</p>
      <p>However, there is a new governance coming into F1 and this will mean an easier process of new rules coming into the sport: <i>"When the new governance comes in, that will take over and allow the development of the rules as they are now," </i>Brawn said to <i>RaceFans.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>"But I think one of the crucial things about the governance going forward is we don't have the situation where we get blocked completely from any change in the future.</i>
      </p>

        <i>"The governance has to be a nicer and better balance of stability for the teams with the ability to make developments when they're really essential."</i>
      </p>
      <p>Many did criticise the idea of a reverse-grid qualifying race, saying it's too "gimmicky" and perhaps the serious aspect of Formula 1 would be lost a bit. However, Brawn has insisted the ideas are for the good of F1.</p>
      <p><i>"The priority for Formula 1, the priority for the FIA is just to make the sport as great as possible," </i>Brawn added. <i>"We don't have any other objectives, so our objectives are purely that."</i></p>
