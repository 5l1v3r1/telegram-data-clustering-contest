      <h1>Laws around 'honest belief' and consent need to be changed: Law Reform Commission</h1>

      <p>Current laws that allow a man accused of rape be acquitted if he honestly believes the woman consented to sex need to be reformed, The Law Reform Commission has said.</p>
      <p>The Commission says the defence of "honest belief" needs to be removed.</p>
      <p>The Commission is recommending that the defence of honest belief in a case where the accused believes a woman has consented to sex, even when she did not, should be replaced with a provision that such belief must be "reasonable".</p>
      <p>A detailed examination of the law was carried out on the request of the attorney general following a 2017 supreme court ruling that focused on what the defendant believed in relation to consent, rather than whether it was a reasonable belief.</p>
      <p>The commission is recommending that where an accused argues that he had a reasonable belief that the woman consented to sex, the commission recommends the jury in the trial should consider a "specific list of circumstances" relating to the personal capacity of the accused, and what steps the accused took to ascertain whether the woman consented to sex.</p>
      <p>Ellen O'Malley Dunlop is the Chair of the National Womenâ€™s Council and Fine Gael candidate in the Dublin South West. She said of the proposed change: "They want an objective definition of whether a person knew the person they were having sex with, was giving consent.</p>
      <p>"I understand the Law Reform Commission's recommendation is for an objective definition of reasonable belief."</p>
