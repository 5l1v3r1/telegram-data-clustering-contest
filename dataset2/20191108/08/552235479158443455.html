      <p>These are the first pictures of the Scottish man whose arm was bitten off by a shark in the Indian Ocean</p>
      <p>The man has been named locally as Richard Martyn Turner from Edinburgh.</p>
      <p>The 44-year-old went missing while snorkeling off the coast of the French island of Réunion, in the Indian Ocean, reports say.</p>
      <p>An arm found in a captured shark's stomach has been identified as his after his wife recognised the wedding ring on one of the fingers.</p>
      <p>Mr Turner's wife, Verity, reported his disappearance on Saturday and was asked by police to check the remains extracted from the shark, it is claimed.</p>
      <p>She told cops she recognised the ring on one of the hand's fingers, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10301372/pictured-shark-ate-british-tourist/">The Sun</a> reports</p>
      <p>A police source told the newspaper: ''The hand and forearm of a man was found inside the stomach of one of the captured tiger sharks.</p>
      <p>"The sharks were caught because they were swimming way out of their natural habitat. They were in the lagoon area which is shark-free because of the coral.</p>
      <p>"But they somehow managed to find a way in."</p>
      <p>DNA tests are underway to confirm whether the limb is Mr Turner's.</p>
      <p>The Sun reported that the man who vanished in Reunion on Saturday was named locally as Mr Turner.</p>
      <p>The arm found in the shark belonged to him, according to the newspaper.</p>
      <p>Police are not sure if the man who the arm belongs to was killed by a shark or whether he was eaten after drowning.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the local search and rescue crew – the Centre Regional Operationnel de Surveillance et de Sauvetage told the Daily Mail: “The victim was certainly swimming but it is not clear whether he was attacked or he was already dead when he was eaten.</p>
      <p>“One possibility is that he became unwell while in the lagoon and was taken by the currents into deeper water.”</p>
      <p>Mr Turner and his wife were staying at the island's prestigious Lux hotel, celebrating her 40th birthday.</p>
      <p>An investigating source previously said: "The tourist and his wife were spending a week on the island and he had gone out swimming in the Hermitage Lagoon, off Saint-Gilles, alone on Saturday.</p>
      <p>"When he did not get back, his wife sounded the alarm, and a full search was launched, involving boats and a helicopter.</p>
      <p>"Divers searched around a coral reef in the area, and there were also patrols on land involving sniffer dogs. Sadly, the man could not be found."</p>
      <p>A police source told the Scottish Sun that the sharks were three to four metres long. </p>
      <p>It is understood that the shark was killed because it was considered a threat to holidaymakers, the Scotsman reported.</p>
      <p>There are frequent shark attacks around Reunion, which is 500 miles from Madagascar.</p>
      <p>The island, which sits on the so-called 'Shark Highway' between South Africa and Australia, has had 10 fatal shark attacks since the year 2000.</p>
      <p>Tiger sharks have a record second only to Great White sharks for attacks on humans.</p>
