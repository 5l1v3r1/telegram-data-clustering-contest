      <h1>Japanese automaker Honda cuts profit outlook as sales slip</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T08:40:19+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 08:40</time> by <a rel="author">YURI KAGEYAMA, AP Business Writer</a></address>
      <p><b>TOKYOÂ (AP)</b> - Honda has become the latest automaker to report weaker earnings as global demand softens.</p>
      <p>The company said Friday that its profit in the July-September fell 6.7% from a year earlier to 196.5 billion yen ($1.8 billion) as vehicle and motorcycle sales slipped.</p>
      <p>An unfavorable exchange rate also hurt earnings, the Tokyo-based automaker said.</p>
      <p>Honda Motor Co.'s quarterly revenue declined 2.9% to 3.7 trillion yen ($34 billion) as sales declined in the U.S., Japan, the rest of Asia and Europe.</p>
      <p>Honda, which makes the Odyssey minivan and Asimo robot, said higher tax expenses also hurt results.</p>
      <p>Honda lowered its full-year net profit forecast for the fiscal year through March 2020 to 575 billion yen ($5.2 billion). That's down from the 645 billion yen ($5.9 billion) estimate given in August, and below the 610 billion yen earned in the previous fiscal year.</p>
      <p>Honda said its financial services business did well, helping to offset some of the damage from other divisions.</p>
      <p>Honda officials acknowledged to reporters that more needed to be done to reduce costs. They said a promised restructuring was underway.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, Honda's Japanese rival Toyota Motor Corp. reported its sales grew in key global regions, helping Japan's top automaker post an increase in quarterly net profit despite a strong yen, which hurts the earnings of Japanese exporters.</p>
      <p>Nissan Motor Co., a Japanese automaker that has seen its brand power tarnished amid a financial misconduct scandal, reports earnings next week.</p>
