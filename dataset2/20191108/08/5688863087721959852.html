        <b>Mumbai head coach Jorge Costa has stated that it would be his job and responsibility to turn things around in the Mumbai camp after consecutive home losses for last year’s semi-finalists. Reflecting on the goals his side has been conceding of late, Costa has termed them as ‘gifts’ for opponents.</b>

      <p>After conceding four goals against Odisha FC, Mumbai weren’t expecting things to improve against a more prolific <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/fc_goa">FC Goa</a> side on Thursday, and the Gaurs ended up scoring four goals at the Mumbai Football Arena. </p>
      <p>The Islanders, who had conceded 20 goals in 18 matches last season, have already shipped in eight goals in four matches so far. And the fact that those came in home matches alone, would be a huge concern for coach Costa, who has promised to resolve the issue by the time the international break ends.</p>
      <p>“It is my job and I must turn things around. Eight goals conceded in two matches, and today, three were from set-pieces. The goals we conceded were silly and I must fix this, and I hope after this (international) break I have the conditions to fix this,” said Costa at the post-match press conference, reported ISL website. </p>
      <p>“After the game I spoke with the team and I don’t know if it is a lack of concentration. All the eight goals, with all respect to Odisha and Goa, I think they were gifts from us. We worked on defending set-pieces this week. My players knew what to do but still, they did not. If you do not do as I say, then I need to change you. I believe my players want to do it, but they cannot. </p>
      <p>“And if they cannot then I will not close my eyes. When I came here it was to succeed. I think we had a very good first season. I am not here for holidays, so the things must be as I want. I’m the boss, I must take decisions and stop these silly goals,” he further added.</p>
      <p>However, despite the numerous individual errors in the last two matches that have led to Mumbai conceding goals from the most harmless of situations, the Portuguese didn’t resort to any blame game. </p>
      <p>“These things can happen in the biggest clubs as well. We knew that we could score. But I’m sad with the result and the silly goals we conceded, but I’m not sad with the team. We worked hard and played well. We created some chances in the first half, but something was missing. We had the power to come from 2-0 to 2-2 and I can promise you that hopefully after the break we will be a much better team.”</p>
      <p>“We conceded silly goals and we had the opportunities, but we didn’t score. We are not yet dead; we are still there (in the league)... I think that Mumbai City can be so much more. This loss is to remember and not forget, and I can promise that after this break we will be back, and we will fight till the end,” Costa added.</p>
