      <p>The Premier League is back and nothing excites English football fans more than the prospect of watching two heavyweights battle it out. That’s right, we have the perfect end to the last Gameweek before yet another international break and it’s a firecracker of a fixture. <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/manchester_city">Manchester City</a> and Liverpool lock horns in what will be a title clash despite the fact that we’re only twelve games into the season.</p>
      <p>It shows just how tight things have become but it’s not the only game on show. Arsenal visits <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/leicester_city">Leicester City</a> and the King Power Stadium in the final game on Saturday with the hopes that they can resurrect their season against a top-four contender. Then there’s <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/manchester_united">Manchester United</a> taking on Brighton, Wolverhampton Wanderers hosting Aston Villa and a relegation three-pointer as Norwich City host Watford.</p>
      <p>Another relegation three-pointer also happens to be between <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/southampton">Southampton</a> and Everton, while Chelsea play hosts to a London derby against <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/crystal_palace">Crystal Palace</a>. But if Premier League football isn’t for you, then in Spain, Real Betis play hosts to Sevilla and Granada battle Valencia in the marquee clashes of the week. In Germany, we have the first Der Klassiker as <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/bayern_munich">Bayern Munich</a> host <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/borussia_dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a> but with just five points separating 10th place and 1st place every game in the <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/tournament/bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> is important.</p>
      <p>In Italy, we watch as <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/juventus">Juventus</a> battle <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/ac_milan">AC Milan</a> and Brescia take on Tornio. And finally, in France, we watch as Marseille host Olympique Lyon. A lot of football to watch and this week has a little something for everyone.</p>
