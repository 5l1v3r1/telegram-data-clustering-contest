      <p>The pressure is mounting for Norman Mapeza in his role as the head coach of relegation-threated Chippa United.</p>
      <p>Chippa remain the only team without a win in the Absa Premiership so far this season, with their most recent loss to Kaizer Chiefs on Wednesday evening. </p>

          <b>3 Players Shine As Golden Boot Race Heats Up </b>

      </p>
      <p>Going into the weekend’s away match to AmaZulu, Chippa are currently having their camp resembling a hospital ward, with a number of the team's regulars sidelined by injuries. </p>
      <p>Elvis Moyo, Boikanyo Komane and Frederic Nsabiyumva are the latest players to have picked injuries at the Port Elizabeth club.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the Chilli Boys will be without Tercious Malepe, who will sit out the second of his two-match suspension. </p>
      <p>Despite having lauded his team for improvement after the 2-0 loss to Chiefs, Mapeza has come under pressure as the gap in points between bottom-placed Chippa and other teams widens. </p>

      </p>
      <p>As reported by the Siya crew, before Mapeza’s appointment as Chippa coach, there had been deliberations between the Zimbabwean mentor’s representatives and the club on the clause that the Eastern Cape outfit wanted to include in the contract to review his performance after three games.</p>
      <p>However, the proposal was dismissed by the coach’s camp saying that it was unreasonable, as Mapeza was joining a team he didn’t assemble and was not part of the side's pre-season preparations.     </p>
