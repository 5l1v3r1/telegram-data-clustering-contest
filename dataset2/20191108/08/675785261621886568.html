      <h1>Virgil van Dijk is the right answer to Ballon d'Or question after exemplary 2019</h1>
      <h2>Liverpool won the Champions League and are setting new standards while Holland are enjoying a renaissance, with Van Dijk at the heart of both teams</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T08:50:22+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 08:50</time> by <a rel="author">John Cross, https://www.facebook.com/johncrossmirror/</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/premier-league">Premier League</a> title showdown at Anfield will showcase the very best of English football.</p>
      <p>Liverpool, the European champions, trying to dethrone the reigning back-to-back Premier League champions Manchester City with the likes of Mo Salah, Sadio Mane, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling at the heart of the battle.</p>
      <p>But if you asked most neutrals if there was one player who stood out from the rest this weekend, the player that could make the difference, then it would almost certainly be a defender.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/virgil-van-dijk">Virgil van Dijk</a> stands head and shoulders above the rest both physically and metaphorically, the main reason why <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> won the Champions League last season and why Holland are enjoying a renaissance.</p>

      <p>And as the voting closes this weekend for the Ballon d’Or, it should be van Dijk who wins the award and becomes the first defender since 2006 to be recognised.</p>
      <p>There are 180 journalists voting on a 30-man shortlist and surely there can only be one winner.</p>
      <p>Van Dijk is the favourite with the bookmakers but, bizarrely, the odds are shortening on Lionel Messi which would be unthinkable if you think back upon the year just gone.</p>

      <p>It has been Van Dijk who has made the world of difference for Liverpool and his towering performances in defence which won them the European Cup and has given them the edge of City this season.</p>
      <p>City will always - and understandably - trumpet Aymeric Laporte as their defensive kingpin but you can flip that on its head and see the difference during his absence.</p>
      <p>That is what van Dijk gives to Liverpool.</p>
      <p>And, after all, it was at Anfield where Messi suffered one of the worst nights of his life and, as he has admitted on several occasions, he is still haunted by the Champions League defeat.</p>

      <p>Barcelona were 3-0 up from the first leg, were blown away by Liverpool and if that is not enough as proof as to why van Dijk should get the nod over Messi then the fact that Jurgen Klopp’s men went on to win the trophy should be the clincher.</p>
      <p>They are judging on three categories:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Individual and collective performances</li>
        <li>Player class (talent and fair play)</li>
        <li>Overall judgement of the player’s career</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Now, everyone understands that Messi is one of the greatest of all time, he got the FIFA gong this year but it was van Dijk put Holland back on the map as an international force and helped Liverpool rule Europe.</p>
      <p>He also won the Champions League and his individual performances in that team effort made him the best defender in Europe.</p>

      <p>Van Dijk was man of the match in the final against Tottenham and is both elegant on and off the pitch. A class act and an example to all.</p>
      <p>Messi won the Best FIFA Men’s Player award earlier this year where he finished ahead of Van Dijk who was expected to come out on top but that should not cloud judgement on the Ballon D’Or.</p>
      <p>Cristiano Ronaldo and Messi have both won it five times, Luka Modric broke their dominance last year after Real Madrid won the Champions League and Croatia reached the World Cup final.</p>
      <p>It was a good decision because the player was judged on the year.</p>
      <p>No defender has won the Ballon d’Or Award since Fabio Cannavaro in 2006. The Italian led his country to World Cup success that year and, in a similar way, that should be the reasoning behind van Dijk.</p>
      <p>It was van Dijk who led Liverpool to European glory, the Champions League is the most prestigious club trophy and it is the reason why the Dutchman should get the vote.</p>
