      <p>Gfycat is <a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/11/08/gif-site-gfycat-announces-mass.html">threatening to sue Archive Team for archiving the site's old, anonymously-posted images</a> that are <a href="https://twitter.com/GfycatHelp/status/1191770073259577344">marked for deletion</a>. Gfycat's CEO, Dan McEleney, <a href="https://twitter.com/textfiles/status/1192518136878321664">says</a> archiving the memes it hosts is a "denial of service attack" and demands compensation. From a report: <i>The fallout is ongoing on Twitter, with users of the site panicking about their old content and the company asking for (and being refused) private negotiations with Internet Archive, which [Archive Team founder Jason Scott] <a href="https://twitter.com/textfiles/status/1192595714905432065">points out</a> is not the same entity as the legally-threatened Archive Team.</i></p>
