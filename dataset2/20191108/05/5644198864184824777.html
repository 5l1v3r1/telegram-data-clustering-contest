      <p>GoPro Inc beat analysts' estimates for third-quarter revenue on Thursday, boosted by demand for its new Hero camera, sending its shares up 11per cent in after-market trading.</p>
      <p>REUTERS: GoPro Inc beat analysts' estimates for third-quarter revenue on Thursday, boosted by demand for its new Hero camera, sending its shares up 11per cent in after-market trading.</p>
      <p>Through its flagship "HERO" line, the company is trying to differentiate its premium-priced offerings from smartphones with improved cameras, as it looks to lure back action junkies.</p>

      <p>GoPro launched two new cameras including a ramped up version of its HERO line in October.</p>
      <p>"Both products (HERO8 Black and MAX) appear to be unquestionable hits with consumers and we're optimistic about their impact on our business going forward," Chief Executive Officer Nicholas Woodman said.</p>
      <p>The action-camera maker's revenue fell about 54per cent to US$131.2 million (Â£102.36 million), beating estimates of US$126.4 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>The company's net loss widened to US$74.8 million, or 51 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, from US$27.1 million, or 19 cents per share, a year earlier.</p>
      <p>Excluding items, the company lost 42 cents per share, smaller than the expectations of a loss of 48 cents.</p>
