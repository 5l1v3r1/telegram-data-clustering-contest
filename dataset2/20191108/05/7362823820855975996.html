      <p>Publisher Judith Regan told <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/11/06/ex-msnbc-journo-mark-halperins-publisher-condemns-cancel-culture/">The New York Post</a> she blamed a “guilty-until-proven-innocent, cancel culture” for the low sales and stressed that Halperin shouldn’t be condemned to a lifetime of unemployment "for an accusation that’s 12 years old.”</p>

      <p>"He’s tried to become a better person. He had a right to write it, and I have a right to publish it," she added. "He really has changed.”</p>
      <p>The book was widely criticized when it was announced in August and many major news organizations have refused to do interviews with the author.</p>
      <p>Halperin was fired from his contributor jobs at Showtime, NBC and MSNBC – he was a frequent guest on "Morning Joe" – after multiple women accused him of sexual misconduct, including allegedly grabbing former ABC coworkers’ breasts and pressing his clothed and erect penis against them.</p>
      <p>He initially acknowledged he caused “pain” by pursuing “inappropriate” relationships with coworkers and in April he said he wanted to apologize again “to the women that I mistreated, who told their stories, and who were hurt by me."</p>
