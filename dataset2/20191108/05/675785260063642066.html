      <h2>Leicester host Arsenal in huge clash for both teams' top-four hopes this weekend, and Vardy could have been on the opposite side for teatime kick-off</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T05:35:41+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 05:35</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Brendan Rodgers has revealed why Leicester ace Jamie Vardy turned down the chance to join <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> as a huge clash between the two sides looms on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Arsenal visit <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> on Saturday looking to boost their top-four hopes by closing a six-point gap to Leicester, with Rodgers' team currently third in the Premier League and on course for a Champions League spot.</p>
      <p>The Gunners will face a Leicester team spearheaded by an on-form <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jamie-vardy">Vardy</a> , who is currently the Premier League's top scorer with 10 goals from the first 11 games.</p>
      <p>But it could have been a different story for the England international after Arsenal had a bid for the striker accepted in 2016, after Vardy had helped fire Leicester to the Premier League title.</p>

      <p>However, Vardy turned down the move, and the 32-year-old will be looking to prove he made the right decision as the Foxes bid to open up a nine-point gap on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Speaking ahead of Saturday's teatime kick-off, Leicester boss Rodgers reflected on the player’s decision not to join Arsenal when he had the chance.</p>
      <p>“The one thing I know from Jamie Vardy is he’s a team player," said Rodgers in quotes reported by <a href="https://www.football.london/arsenal-fc/transfer-news/jamie-vardy-leicester-arsenal-transfer-17221621">Football.london</a> .</p>
      <p>"It’s about the team. Of course he’s a top striker but he loves competition. You see it every day in our working time together."</p>

      <p>Rodgers dismissed the idea that Vardy rejected the move because he feared the competition at the Emirates, saying: “He’s the type of guy who’s proven himself all his life, all his career, and he’s proven himself to be one of the top strikers in Europe.</p>
      <p>"It wouldn’t have been because of that, that he didn’t go to Arsenal.</p>
      <p>“There were a number of things: he was probably offered a good deal here, felt comfortable here, stable here, his family.</p>
      <p>"It’s an incredible club. Especially with all the paraphernalia around the Premier League.</p>
      <p>"This is a club that’s pure in its community spirit, doesn’t get carried away with all the stuff that the Premier League can bring, and he’s the type of guy who will have enjoyed that, being looked after.”</p>
