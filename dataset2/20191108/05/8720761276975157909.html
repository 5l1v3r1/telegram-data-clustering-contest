      <p>Small-satellite startup Kepler and its nanosatellites <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/07/kepler-achieves-a-world-first-for-satellite-broadband-with-100mbps-connection-to-the-arctic/">have successfully demonstrated achieving over 100Mbps of network speed to a Germany icebreaker sea vessel</a> that acts as a mobile lab for the <a href="https://www.mosaic-expedition.org/">MOSAiC</a> research expedition. TechCrunch reports: <i>This is the first time there's been a high-bandwidth satellite network for any central Arctic ground-based use, Kepler says, and this connection isn't just a technical demo: it's being used for the researchers in the MOSAiC team, which is made up of hundreds of individuals, to transfer data back and forth between the ship and shore-based research stations, which improves all aspects of working with the considerable quantities of data being gathered by the team. On the icebreaker floating research ship, Kepler has demonstrated 38Mbps down, and 120Mbps up.</i></p>
