      <p>A study looking at the impact on women who discover their partners have committed a sexual offence has detailed how one woman decided to have a child with her husband after learning of his offending.</p>
      <p>Given the nature of his offence — accessing child sexual abuse imagery on the internet — he has never been allowed to spend time alone with his two-year-old daughter.</p>
      <p>Only one woman of the eight who participated in the research ended her marriage immediately. She had been married 20 years when she discovered her husband had raped her niece.</p>
      <p>Six said they intended to stay in their marriages and attributed this to their husband’s engagement in treatment to address his offending behaviour.</p>
      <p>The catastrophic impact of finding out their husbands had engaged in sexual offences is captured in a paper which will be presented today at the Psychological Society of Ireland’s annual conference in Kilkenny.</p>
      <p>The research, by Trinity College Dublin (TCD) student Eileen Conmy, who has a doctorate in Counselling Psychology, was inspired by her experiences at Patrick Randall’s Forensic Psychology Service where she encountered these women.</p>
      <p>One study participant wept as she said: “If you put 100 people in a room, he would be the last person that you would think would do it. The last person, I just trusted him so much.”</p>
      <p>Six participants were married to men who committed non-contact offences — possession of child sex abuse imagery (CSAI), production and possession of CSAI, possession and distribution of CSAI, and possession of illicit pornography.</p>
      <p>One was married to a man who committed incest offences and one was divorced from a man who raped a 15-year-old girl.</p>
      <p>In the aftermath of learning of their husbands’ behaviour, the women reported fear of sleeping, of going to the shops, and of experiencing paranoia.</p>
      <p>The betrayal the women experienced was “aggravated by the trauma of having their houses raided,” the study stated.</p>
      <p>Five women described experiencing internal conflict regarding how they viewed themselves — as a woman, wife, and mother. One husband told his wife that her personal appearance had been a contributing factor in his offending.</p>
      <p>Three of the women believed a death would be easier to deal with. Seven of the participants described a future filled with uncertainty.</p>
      <p>“They were waiting to discover if their husbands would go to prison, and if the offending would become public knowledge by being reported by the media,” the study stated.</p>
      <p>All said their lives would never be the same. They said they viewed themselves as secondary victims and feared social reprisal.</p>
      <p>Barbara Hannigan, professor of Counselling Psychology at TCD, said as a result of the study, Garda policy has changed.</p>
      <p>Now when raids are carried out on suspected offenders’ homes, their partners are given information leaflets and contact details for support services.</p>
      <p>“Garda policy has actually changed as a result of this study,” she said.</p>
