      <h1>Sparkbrook traders fear they will be kicked out in city council Christmas sell off plan</h1>
      <h2>A baker, a classic scooter lover, a laundry and an ice cream maker are among the small businesses in Sparkbrook who fear for their futures because of council plans to flog Montgomery Street Business Centre.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T05:30:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 05:30</time> by <a rel="author">Jane Haynes, https://www.facebook.com/politicsandpeoplebrum/</a></address>
      <p>Defiant traders in the heart of Birmingham have launched a fighting fund to try to thwart a council sell-off that they say could put 80 jobs at risk.</p>
      <p>The small business owners at Montgomery Street Business Centre in <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/sparkbrook">Sparkbrook</a> hope they can persuade cash-strapped Birmingham City Council to abandon plans to sell the site where their companies are based to the highest bidder at auction next month - and instead let them buy it themselves.</p>
      <p>They say a sale to a developer who could kick them out or hike rents would be a devastating blow for their mostly fledgling businesses, which include an ice cream maker, cake baker, vegan food producer, metal polisher, printer, number plate maker, <a href="https://www.vespa.com/sg_EN/">Vespa scooter</a> refurbisher, organic veg delivery firm, laundry, youth training centre and chocolate maker.</p>
      <p>Together around 80 jobs are at stake.</p>
      <p>They want the council to back their alternative vision of selling the site to them to run as a non-profit business hub, owned and run by tenants - but so far they have been knocked back and told instead to take their chances at the auction.</p>

      <p>"We believe this estate should stay out of the hands of profiteers and remain available for people with business dreams to start up their ventures, just like we have all done," said cooperative founder and vegan food producer Alex McDonagh.</p>
      <p>They have just launched <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/save-montgomery-street-business-centre">a gofundme page</a> to try to encourage anyone who supports their vision to back them.</p>
      <p>The units, built in the 1980s, are due to go for <a href="https://www.bondwolfeauctions.com/properties/93882-property-auction-birmingham/">auction on December 11th,</a> with a guide price of more than £500,000.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Traders say they were furious to find out about the auction when one of them spotted the site in an auction catalogue from <a href="https://www.bondwolfeauctions.com/">Bond Wolfe Auctions.</a></p>
      <p>A mooted sale earlier this year had fallen through, so the entrepreneurs thought the plan had been abandoned. "Nobody from the council approached us to discuss the new sale plan, we have been kept in the dark," said Alex. "It means we have only got a few weeks if we hope to raise the money to put in a bid ourselves."</p>

      <p>The newly formed Montgomery Street Cooperative, supported by Cooperative Futures, say they need to earmark 'at least' £150,000 as a reasonable deposit to stand any hope of winning the auction.</p>
      <p>"There are very few business units of this size and cost locally," added Alex.</p>
      <p>"What worries the traders on this busy estate is that a developer might be keen to redevelop the land. The tenants are on six month rolling leases, which means they would have limited protection if a commercial owner wanted to maximise profits by hiking rents, bringing in alternative tenants or redeveloping the site.</p>

      <p>"We have very little protection. It's a really worrying time for us all. It would be really hard for businesses here to find alternatives - most other industrial units in the city are too big, or too expensive, or both," said Alex.</p>
      <p>Their fears are amplified by a comment in the auction brochure that states: "There is an opportunity for a redevelopment of this site to take advantage of the prominent location, canal access and distinctive historic buildings."</p>
      <p>The tenants, who currently pay an annual rent of around £61,000 between them, are researching other ways to protect their estate, including applying for it to be listed as an <a href="https://mycommunity.org.uk/help-centre/resources/land-and-building-assets/assets-community-value-acv/">Asset of Community Value</a> . If successful, it would mean they would have to be offered first option on any future sale.</p>

      <p>In a letter to the council urging them to reconsider an auction, traders say: "The units at Montgomery Street Business Centre were built by the city council to help incubate small start-up enterprises. They are small, low rent units that are ideal for small businesses in the community.</p>
      <p>"We understand our units are very unique in this respect and are a real asset to our community that deserve preservation. There are also some listed buildings circling our site which are very much a part of Birmingham’s industrial legacy.</p>
      <p>"We understand from a famous local historian that our site was originally a Council Works. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Union_Canal">Birmingham Union Canal</a> which runs adjacent to our site was used to ferry building materials, unloaded to construct the housing and serve the factories of Sparkbrook and Small Heath.</p>

      <p>"We are very committed to saving our units at Montgomery Street along with our jobs, and we are confident we can cooperate together to secure the site and improve it for generations to come."</p>
      <p>The site is opposite the grade II listed Marlborough pub.</p>
      <p>Sunny Chana, who owns <a href="https://www.sunnydigitalprints.com/">Sunny Digital Prints</a> , said he was concerned about the risk of needing to relocate if a developer took over the land, including moving his specialist printing equipment. The business provides a wide range of printing services and employs three people - two of them, like Sunny, are deaf.</p>
      <p>"My business has grown this year and I am concerned if rent goes up or if I need to relocate," he said.</p>
      <p>The tenants' interest in buying the site comes despite concerns about the lack of investment which has seen the estate deteriorate. The site currently has no electronic security gates and areas of obvious disrepair, including leaks in roofs, disrepair to roads, pavements and windows.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>The tenants say they currently pay high service charges, but don't believe they see a comparable amount of investment in the area.</p>
      <p>"We are a close knit bunch so we look out for each other but the estate is run down and security is an issue. It's not just that - there are leaks and disrepair, broken fences, a broken access gate, and anti social behaviour and thefts to contend with," added Alex. Nitrous oxide canisters litter the paths and roads around the estate, and litter is a constant issue.</p>
      <p>The businesses have raised their concerns with the city council.</p>
      <p>Our pictures, above and below, highlight some of the areas they are worried about:</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>The traders were backed by their then Hall Green MP Roger Godsiff, who wrote to the council pressing their case. In his letter he asked the council to support the business owners, saying: "The city council are seeking to encourage and promote employment and these 30 units provide 80 much needed jobs in the Sparkbrook area."</p>
      <p>He suggested that, as a minimum, the auction should include conditions that protected the units long term, including rent caps.</p>
      <p>In a statement about the sale proposal, the council said: “The Montgomery Street Business Centre is due to be sold via auction on 11 December, when any interested parties will be able to make bids.</p>
      <p>“The co-operative is of course welcome to bid on the day and our officers would be more than happy to meet with members beforehand to explain the process."</p>
      <p>The business centre was one of nine prime sites earmarked for sale by the city council in a glossy prospectus last year.</p>
      <p>In the brochure, marketed to developers and investors, council leader Cllr Ian Ward and corporate director of economy, Waheed Nazir, say the sites are "surplus" and their sales will help the council "realise our ambitions for Birmingham and to support the great citizens of this city."</p>
      <p>Also earmarked in the prospectus are Port Hope Road and Kyotts Lake industrial estates in Sparkbrook, and nearby Sydenham Road Business Centre.</p>
      <h3>The businesses of Montgomery Street Business Centre</h3>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>Beet the System</h4>
      <p>Alex McDonagh is a plasterer by trade but was keen to break away from the industry 'for the good of my health'. He now operates a vegan worker cooperative, where he and his workers own and control the business.</p>
      <p><a href="http://beetthesystem.co.uk/">Beet the System</a> supplies eateries and shops with plastic-free, organic vegan food including fresh tempeh - a fermented food high in plant protein that originated in Indonesia. They also supply soy free tempehs using locally grown pulses and are bringing in misos and koji very soon.</p>

      <p>He has used his experience and contacts to spearhead the creation of a cooperative at the trading estate, supported by his trading neighbours.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>Togri Bakery</h4>
      <p>Former scientist Tom Grimmett, 36, from Perry Barr, set up his business four years ago making unique birthday cakes for delivery across Birmingham and Solihull.</p>
      <p>He's got a physics degree and Master's qualification but his first love is baking. "I wanted to run my own business rather than just work for others. The centre is ideal - it is very cheap as it's aimed at small businesses, and the support we give each other is great."</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Tom first heard of the council's plans to sell the centre in December 2018, and then that it had been sold - only for the sale to later fall through. It is now up for sale for a second time, he said.</p>
      <p>The attraction of being based at the trading estate was that it was both cheap and great for small start-ups. He said his business has grown by 30% in the past year and he was now on the verge of going full time in the business - but the uncertainty of a new owner would impact his future plans.</p>
      <h4>Youth and Training Centre CIC</h4>
      <p>Mohamed Hishaam, from the Youth and Training Centre CIC, is backing the buyout bid. His organisation provides training and support to local residents, including members of the Somalian community, providing textile classes and help with filling in forms.</p>

      <h4>Richard Tyler Engineering</h4>
      <p><a href="http://www.richtyler.co.uk/">Richard Tyler</a> is a classic Vespa specialist, who restores and sells this iconic scooter brand. He also re-engineers parts. Richard's had a lifelong passion for the Vespa, from when he bought his first Vespa aged 15. In the picture below he is sat on his 'pride and joy".</p>
      <p>In March this year he made the bold move of abandoning his engineering career to go it alone. "When I was looking for premises in the city there were so few small units available, this was one of the very few there were. I'm just at the start of things so if I had to leave here it would be really difficult," said Richard, 50.</p>

      <h4>Vegetropolis</h4>
      <p>Tom Thompson runs <a href="https://vegetropolis.com/">Vegetropolis</a>, a 100% vegan organic fruit and veg wholefoods delivery service from his unit. It's a business he has slowly grown, turning it into a thriving online enterprise. He delivers fresh organic fruit and veg boxes to homes and businesses across the city.</p>
      <p> But Tom fears his that a forced relocation or a big rent hike could threaten his future.</p>
      <p> "This has been hanging over me and others on the site. I attended a public consultation about the council budget last February, when the leader Ian Ward said he was not aware our site was being sold. We have had no communication since."</p>
