      <p>SANTIAGO: Chile's President Sebastian Pinera on Thursday (Nov 7) announced a series of measures to tighten public order in the wake of three weeks of anti-government protests that have left 20 people dead.</p>
      <p>The legislative package, aimed at curbing violent demonstrations and looting, includes measures that would ban protesters from wearing hoods and burning barricades, and provides greater protection for police.</p>

      <p>"We are convinced that this agenda represents and constitutes a significant and important contribution to improve our capacity to safeguard public order," said Pinera, who has rejected calls to resign.</p>
      <p>He also said a special prosecution team would be established to try offenders while, in the longer term, intelligence gathering would be revamped.</p>
      <p>Pinera's announcement came after demonstrations on Wednesday spread into Santiago's wealthiest neighborhoods for the first time.</p>
      <p>Unrest that began on OctÂ 18 with protests against a rise in transport tickets and other austerity measures has descended into burning, looting and daily clashes between protesters and police.</p>
      <p>Police said on Thursday nearly 10,000 people had been arrested during the unrest, most being released shortly afterwards.</p>
      <p>The conservative president last week reshuffled his government and announced a series of measures aimed at placating the protesters, including a law guaranteeing a minimum monthly wage of some US$467.</p>
      <p>But protesters have continued demanding that the right-wing billionaire step down.</p>
      <p>Pinera said in a BBC interview broadcast on Tuesday that he would not resign over the protests, arguing that Chile's social problems "have been accumulating for the past 30 years."</p>
      <p>The president said he had convened a meeting of Chile's National Security Council on Thursday afternoon to discuss the ongoing crisis.</p>
