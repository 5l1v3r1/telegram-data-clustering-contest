      <p>A Ming masterpiece, discovered when a Cork family brought it for a routine valuation, has sold under the hammer at €610,000, €490,000 more than it was expected to fetch.</p>

      <p>The rare Chinese moon flask, estimated at €80,000 to €120,000, was found at an antiques valuation at Blarney Castle in September.</p>
      <p>Its sale at Sheppards in Durrow yesterday was greeted by a round of applause, according to Auction house Antiques and Art Ireland.</p>
      <p>Sheppard’s Irish Auction House in Durrow, Co Laois, imposed a special condition of no internet bidding on the piece.</p>
      <p>Registered bidders were required to pay a deposit and attend the saleroom in person.</p>
      <p>The value of the heirloom was revealed in September, when a Cork family visited the evaluation event with the piece, which they thought might be worth a few thousand euro.</p>
      <p>“From the minute it came out of the box, we knew it was an important piece,” said auctioneer Philip Sheppard.</p>

      <p>“Everything about it was consistent with being an authentic Ming blue and white flask, dating from the Yongle period.”</p>
      <p>The Yongle Emperor, the third Emperor of the Ming dynasty, reigned from 1402 to 1424.</p>
      <p>Mr Sheppard would not name the owners of the piece, other than to say they are “an old Cork family, with connections going back to a colonial past — India during the Raj”.</p>
      <p>The family inherited it more than 50 years ago from a cousin and they brought it to the valuation in Blarney out of curiosity.</p>
      <p>Mr Sheppard believed the piece to be a Ming flask, based on its colour, its weight, touch, and bubble distribution beneath the glaze, which was consistent with a piece from the 15th century.</p>
      <p>Its discovery prompted international interest.</p>
      <p>“We will literally have guys flying in from Shanghai and Hong Kong for this,” said Mr Sheppard.</p>
