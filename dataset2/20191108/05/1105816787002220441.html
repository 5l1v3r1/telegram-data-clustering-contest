      <h1>'Uncharted territory' as bushfires rage across Australia's east</h1>

      <p><b>SYDNEY: </b>Dozens of bushfires raged out of control across eastern Australia on Friday, blocking escape routes for residents and shuttering the main highway linking major cities on the country’s Pacific coast.</p>
      <p>More than 90 blazes pockmarked the New South Wales countryside, 50 of them uncontained, tearing through tens of thousands of hectares.</p>
      <p>“We are in uncharted territory,” New South Wales Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told public broadcaster ABC. “We have never seen this many fires concurrently at emergency warning level.”</p>
      <p>Authorities said fires had breached containment lines and forced the closure of the Pacific Highway linking Sydney and Brisbane in two places.</p>

      <p>Emergency warnings were introduced for 14 flashpoints, bringing warnings to evacuate immediately.</p>
      <p>In some areas, residents were told to simply “seek shelter as it is too late to leave”.</p>
      <p>Local radio stopped normal programming and provided instructions about how to try to survive fires if trapped at home or in a vehicle.</p>
      <p>A prolonged drought, strong winds, low humidity and high temperatures have conspired to make the landscape a tinderbox.</p>
      <p>“It’s a very dynamic, volatile and dangerous set of circumstances,” said Fitzsimmons.</p>
      <p>Bushfires are common in Australia, but the country is gearing up for busy bushfire season with record temperatures predicted for the summer months.</p>
