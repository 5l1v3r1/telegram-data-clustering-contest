      <h1>Twenty-four-hours is all it takes to lose your life savings - and retire penniless</h1>
      <h2>Nearly two-thirds of people would trust someone offering pensions advice out of the blue – one of the main warning signs of a scam. That's despite pension cold calls being officially banned earlier this year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T05:00:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author">Emma Munbodh, https://www.facebook.com/EmmaMunbodh</a></address>
      <p>Victims of pensions scams could lose 22 years' worth of savings in just 24 hours, according to new figures.</p>
      <p>The average amount victims lost to scams in 2018 was £82,000 - which typically takes 22 years to build in a pension pot.</p>
      <p>The report by The Pensions Regulator (TPR) found that one in four people would take less than a day to decide on whether to accept a pension 'offer'.</p>
      <p>Worryingly, overconfidence could also lead to savers missing the signs of a scam.</p>
      <p>Despite nearly two-thirds saying they feel well informed about their pension decisions, the same proportion would trust someone offering pensions advice out of the blue – one of the main warning signs of a scam.<anchor name="m_-7748508675095684229__Hlk23769127"/>   </p>
      <p>Further still, the more highly educated the person, the more likely they are to fall for a pension scam.</p>

      <p>Those with a university degree are 40% more likely to accept a free pension review from a company they’ve not dealt with before, and 21% more likely to take up the offer of early access to their pension pot. Both common scam tactics.</p>
      <p>Pension fraud can be devastating. Victims can be left facing retirement with limited income, and little or no opportunity to build their years of savings back up.</p>
      <p>As a result, regulators are warning savers to get to know the warning signs of a scam, be ScamSmart and always check who they are dealing with before making a decision on their pensions.</p>
      <p>Mark Steward at the FCA, said: "We know many people have big plans for their retirement, whether it’s seeing new places, learning new skills or helping their families out financially. Pension scammers destroy those dreams, often forever.</p>
      <p>"So be ScamSmart. Reject unsolicited approaches offering ‘help’ with your pension and get advice from an FCA authorised firm before making big changes to your pension fund. Make sure your lifetime savings stay yours."</p>
      <p>Nicola Parish, of Frontline Regulation, TPR, said: "Pension scammers ruin lives, stealing away decades’ of savings with professional-looking websites, ‘expert’ advice and an easy manner making it tough to spot the fraud. But once you sign on the dotted line, often there’s no second chance.</p>
      <p>"Scams can happen to anyone, so before making any decision about your pension, take your time, be ScamSmart and always check who you are dealing with."</p>
      <p>Tom Selby, senior analyst at AJ Bell, added: "Hubris and trusting the 'advice' of strangers are proving to be the undoing of scam victims. This is a recipe for disaster as fraudsters prey on the good nature of hard-working savers.</p>
      <p>"The results of scams are often heartbreaking, with thousands of people losing pensions they have worked their entire lives to diligently build up. In many cases victims are left with little or nothing to fall back on, and have to face up to working longer or living in penury in retirement.</p>
      <p>"Sadly, despite interventions from Government and a drive to raise awareness, scammers aren’t going anywhere, so savers need to be more suspicious when they receive offers out of the blue.</p>
      <p>"For many people their retirement pot could well be the most valuable thing they own, so spending a bit of time researching before parting with it could save a lot of pain."</p>
      <h3>4 simple steps to protect yourself from pension scams</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Reject unexpected pension offers whether made online, on social media or over the phone</li>
        <li>Check who you’re dealing with before changing your pension arrangements – check the  <a href="https://register.fca.org.uk/">FCA Register</a>  or call the FCA helpline on 0800 111 6768 to see if the firm you are dealing with is authorised by the FCA</li>
        <li>Don’t be rushed or pressured into making any decision about your pension</li>
        <li>Consider getting impartial information and advice</li>
        <li>Be extremely wary of any investment ‘opportunities’ that come out of the blue – for example through a cold-call – or people claiming to be ‘advisers’ offering a ‘free pension review’. Professional advice is never free and so following the old maxim ‘if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is’ is a sensible approach.</li>
        <li>Make sure you know who you are dealing with. After all, your pension could be the most valuable asset you own, so don’t hand it over to someone unless you know their credentials check out.</li>
        <li>Slick fraudsters will sometimes pretend to be a bona fide company when in fact they are nothing of the sort, so have a look at the FCA register and Companies House to see if the firm you are dealing with actually exists.</li>
        <li>Don’t be rushed or pressured – such tactics should set off a big red warning light in your mind and are often indicative of a scam.</li>
        <li>If you’re at all unsure speak to a qualified, regulated financial adviser. You will need to pay for this but usually the benefit far outweighs the cost.</li>
      </ol>
