      <h1>Conservatives much better at dating than liberals, survey says</h1>

      <p>It’s a Grand Old Party — especially if you’re single.</p>
      <p>Conservatives are much better at dating than liberals, according to a new survey by the over-50 <a href="https://lumenapp.com/">dating app Lumen</a>.</p>
      <p>The company found that right-wingers are more direct than their left-wing counterparts. They clearly state to potential lovers what they are looking for in terms of life and romance, according to the findings.</p>

      <p>They also value family and friendships higher than liberals and have a smaller, more intimate group of friends. By contrast, liberals tend to thrive in larger social groups. But left-leaners have their advantages, too — they are generally carefree and more fun than conservatives. And they’re more inclined to explore and travel the world than those who lean right, Lumen found.</p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, people who share the same political opinions flock together like birds of a feather.</p>

      <p>Conservative women are twice as likely to chat with their right-wing peers than to initiate a conversation with their liberal counterparts, according to the survey. Left-wing women are similarly set in their ways, as are liberal lads, who are three times more likely to chat with fellow liberals than conservatives.</p>
      <p>Lumen, owned by the same holding company as Bumble, made the findings after analyzing data from its 1.5 million user base.</p>
      <p>The survey comes after The Post reported that <a href="https://nypost.com/2016/06/09/this-dating-site-is-for-trump-lovers-only/">dating can be difficult if you back Donald Trump</a>, especially in blue cities such as New York and Los Angeles.</p>

      <p>“I think there’s a special stigma when people say they’re supporting Trump because of some of the brash things that he’s said,” lifelong Republican David Goss, founder of <a href="https://twitter.com/trumpsinglescom?lang=en">TrumpSingles.com</a>, told us in June.</p>
      <p>“That immediately gets [projected] on his supporters and makes it hard for them when trying to date.”</p>
