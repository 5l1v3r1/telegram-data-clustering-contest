        <b>KAMPALA, Uganda, Nov 8 – Dismas Indiza followed up his round one showing with a 2-under par score in the second round, to maintain the lead at the Lake Victoria Serena Golf Resort Open, on a day that saw Kenyans dominate the top ten slots in the competition.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Up until the par-3 15th hole, Indiza was on course for a 4-under par score, having not dropped a shot through the 14 holes, with four birdies in the bag. He however hit a double boy at the 15th, to settle for a 2-under par, 70 score after 18 holes, to take his overall score to 6-under par, 138.</p>
      <p>It was a round of strong Kenyan performances with nine of the eleven players in the top seven, being Kenyan professionals.</p>
      <p>Vet Lab’s Edwin Mudanyi finished the round in second place, one shot behind Indiza, after shooting a round of 2-under par, off one bogey and three birdies, to take his gross score to 5-under par, 137. Three shots ahead of Golf Park’s David Wakhu, who sits on a score of 2-under, 142 in third.</p>
      <p>The second round belonged to the other Johnnie Walker sponsored professional, Greg Snow and the 2019 Entebbe Open winner, Justus Madoya who shot round leading scores of 3-under par, 69 to see them climb 13 places up the leaderboard to T4, on a gross score of 1-under par, 143.</p>
      <p>Greg Snow put behind a challenging couple of rounds stretching back to the Entebbe Open, to start off round two with a birdie on the par-4, first and set the tone for the round.</p>
      <p>He would hold steady through the next six holes, before hitting another birdie on the par-5 eighth, a dropped shot at the par-4 ninth, saw him return a turning score of one under par, 35.</p>
      <p>Back-to-back birdies on the 13th and 14th saw him take his score to 3-under par, before a bogey on the tricky 15th halted his progress, he however recovered well with a birdie on the par-5 17th, to return to 3-under, a score he would maintain to the end of the round.</p>
      <p>On his part, Madoya shot a bogey on the par-3 third while holding par through the other eight holes in the front nine, it was at the back nine where he got going, with birdies on the 12th, 13th, 14th and 18th to take his score to three under par, 69.</p>
      <p>The duo is tied with Windsor Golf Club’s Sujan Shah, who slipped two places down the leaderboard.</p>
      <p>Herman Mutebi and Ronald Rugumayo finished the round as the best placed Ugandan professionals, in 7th place, alongside Kenya’s Mathew Wahome, Eric Obura and CJ Wangai.</p>
      <p>A total of twenty players, including 12 Kenyans made the CUT to play in round three and four, which was set at 4-over par, among the players who missed the cut include Golf Park’s Jacob Okello, Muthaiga’s Kopan Timbe and Nyali Golf Club’s Njuguna Ngugi.</p>
