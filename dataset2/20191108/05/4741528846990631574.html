      <p><b><a href="http://bit.do/Wealthng-Fixed-Income">Wealth.ng</a> via their eponymous website</b> has onboarded a lot of investors old &amp; new to engage in investments from the comfort of their homes which is now a huge trend currently.</p>
      <p>Recently, they took the convenience of their service a step further as they have now released their investment app first for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ng.wealth">Android</a> and then for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ng/app/wealth-ng/id1484576276">iOS</a>, which users can sign up and invest with, in addition to a user experience upgrade of the platform on the web.</p>
      <p><b>The service has garnered praise</b> and acclaim for both the web and mobile apps as seen on social media and in app store reviews</p>
      <p>According to one of the numerous reviews, <i>“navigation has been swifter than when using web browser. I’ve been anticipating this app for a long time and I’m glad that its out.”</i></p>
      <p>And another comments <i>“This is great, and I love the development and I will be expecting more from you like foreign stock and others.”</i></p>
