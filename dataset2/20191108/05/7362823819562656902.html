      <p>OAKLAND, Calif. â€” Josh Jacobs scored on an 18-yard run with 1:02 remaining and the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/oakland-raiders">Oakland Raiders</a> had a late winning touchdown drive for the second time in five days, beating the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/los-angeles-chargers">Los Angeles Chargers</a> 26-24 on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl">Thursday night</a>.</p>
      <p>Derek Carr led the Raiders (5-4) down the field methodically 75 yards after Philip Rivers threw a 6-yard pass to Austin Ekeler that gave the Chargers (4-6) a 24-20 lead with 4:02 remaining.</p>

      <p>The victory didn't come easy as Daniel Carlson missed the extra point, putting more pressure on the tired Raiders defense to stop Rivers. Trayvon Mullen was called for holding on a fourth-down pass to extend the drive, but Karl Joseph then intercepted a fourth-down pass from Rivers to seal it.</p>
      <p>Joseph also had the game-sealing pass breakup Sunday against Detroit after Carr threw a TD pass to Renfrow in a 31-24 victory.</p>

      <p>Rivers threw interceptions on his first two drives, falling into a 10-0 hole when Erik Harris took the second back 56 yards for a TD. But Rivers responded by throwing two TD passes, including the go-ahead score to Ekeler in his final start at the Coliseum.</p>
      <p>The Raiders blew a chance to open up the game in the third quarter, settling for a field goal after driving to the 4 on the opening drive and then missing a 53-yard field goal in the next drive after DeAndre Washington got stuffed for no gain on third-and-1.</p>
      <p>The Chargers settled for a field goal after getting inside the 10 later in the quarter.</p>

      <p>Melvin Gordon had 22 carries for 108 yards and a TD that put the Chargers up 14-10 in the second quarter.</p>
      <p>The Raiders responded with their first sustained drive of the game and took a 17-14 lead at the half on Carr's 9-yard pass to rookie fullback Alec Ingold with 20 seconds remaining in the second quarter.</p>
