      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T05:26:14+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 05:26</time> by <a rel="author">James Brinsford, https://www.facebook.com/james.brinsford</a></address>
      <p>Ed Sheeran has found that he is connected to a ruthless mobster, who is the subject of Martin ­Scorsese’s new film.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old singer's family tree has revealed that he is related to Mafia hitman Frank Sheeran, who is portrayed by Robert De Niro in The Irishman.</p>
      <p>The murderous gangster was infamous for "painting houses" with his victims' blood, during vicious slayings that were ordered by his Mafia bosses.</p>
      <p>Ed has reportedly revealed his connection to Frank in a conversation with De Niro's co-star in the movie, Stephen Graham.</p>

      <p>The 46-year-old actor, who recently starred in the latest series of Line of Duty, said: "They’re related, you know. Honest to God — I swear on my nana’s life.</p>
      <p>“That’s what Ed said, he says it’s his distant uncle.”</p>
      <p>While the events in The Irishman are deeply unsavoury, they are based upon real events according to Graham.</p>
      <p>He said about the film: "It’s all based on true events, on Frank Sheeran. Before he passed away, he gave all this information to a ­journalist who turned it into a book.”</p>

      <p>This biography was called I Heard You Paint Houses, and it was written by Charles Brandt.</p>
      <p>He wrote that Frank, who was 6ft 4in, was working for Mafia bosses Russell Bufalino and Angelo Bruno.</p>
      <p>They are depicted in Scorcese's movie by Joe Pesci and Harvey Keitel.</p>
      <p>Sheeran, the gangster - not the singer, also worked as muscle and security for union boss Jimmy Hoffa, who is played by Al Pacino in the movie.</p>

      <p>Brandt has claimed that Frank Sheeran killed Hoffa, after he went missing in 1975.</p>
      <p>Ed himself confirmed the family connection on social media, as The Irishman opened in cinemas before heading to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/netflix">Netflix</a> on November 27.</p>
      <p>The chart-topping singer wrote: "Robert De Niro is playing a top Irish gangster in a new Martin Scorsese film. The gangster he is playing is called Frank Sheeran. True story.”</p>
      <p>Frank died of cancer in 2003, aged 83.</p>
