      <h1>EU's Vestager Says Google's Antitrust Proposal Not Helping Shopping Rivals</h1>

      <p>Google's proposal to <a href="https://tech.slashdot.org/story/19/03/18/2150218/google-seeking-to-promote-rivals-to-stave-off-eu-antitrust-action">create a level playing field for price comparison shopping rivals</a> to stave off fresh fines has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-alphabet-antitrust/eus-vestager-says-googles-antitrust-proposal-not-helping-shopping-rivals-idUSKBN1XH2I8">not led to more traffic for its competitors</a>, Europe's antitrust chief said this week. From a report:<i> European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager two years ago <a href="https://tech.slashdot.org/story/17/12/18/189219/googles-record-fine-of-28-billion-was-a-deterrent-eu-says">slapped Google with a $2.65 billion fine for favoring its own price comparison shopping service</a> and told it to stop its anti-competitive business practices. The world's most popular internet search engine subsequently offered to allow competitors to bid for advertising space at the top of a search page, giving them the chance to compete on equal terms. <br/><br/>The proposal does not seem to be doing the trick, Vestager said. "We may see a show of rivals in the shopping box. We may see a pickup when it comes to clicks for merchants. But we still do not see much traffic for viable competitors when it comes to shopping comparison," she told a Web Summit conference. British price comparison service Foundem, whose <a href="https://search.slashdot.org/story/18/11/22/1452240/in-an-open-letter-to-eus-competition-commissioner-14-european-shopping-comparison-services-say-google-is-not-making-the-search-for-products-fairer">original complaint triggered the EU case against Google</a></i></p>
