      <p>Dropbox Inc beat analysts' estimates for third-quarter revenue on Thursday, as the online file hosting company added more individual and business customers.</p>
      <p>REUTERS: Dropbox Inc beat analysts' estimates for third-quarter revenue and profit on Thursday, as the online file hosting company signed up more individual and business customers to its platform.</p>
      <p>Dropbox, which competes with Alphabet Inc's Google, Microsoft Corp as well as Box Inc , has relied on its "freemium" model to attract more customers. The model allows customers to use the platform's basic features for free, but charges for additional services.</p>

      <p>It acquired e-signature company HelloSign earlier this year and has partnered with rivals Microsoft and Google's file storage platforms, aiming to expand its reach and convert free users to paid customers.</p>
      <p>Dropbox had 14 million subscribers at the end of the quarter, up from 12.3 million a year earlier and ahead of estimates of 13.89 million, according to FactSet.</p>
      <p>Average revenue per user rose to US$123.15, beating Refinitiv estimates of US$122.82.</p>
      <p>The company's deferred revenue, which measures future business for subscription-based software vendors, was US$541.1 million, above estimates of US$534 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>Revenue rose 19per cent to US$428.20 million in the third quarter, beating analysts' estimates of US$423.48 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>However, net loss widened to US$17 million, or 4 cents per share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, from US$5.8 million, or 1 cent per share, a year earlier.</p>
      <p>On an adjusted basis, Dropbox earned 13 cents per share, beating analysts' estimates of 11 cents per share.</p>
      <p>Shares of the company, which initially went up 5per cent in extended trading, were last down 3per cent.</p>
