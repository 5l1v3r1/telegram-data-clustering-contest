        <b>New Zealand's left-arm speedster Trent Boult hopes to make a strong comeback against England in the fourth T20I at Napier. Boult was not a part of the New Zealand T20I side since February 2018 as he was preserved for more important Test series and the all important Cricket World Cup 2019.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Trent Boult is set to make a comeback for the national T20 team after a gap of more than a year and he is pumped up and hopeful of creating an impact for the team in order to win the ongoing T20I series against England. New Zealand lead the series 2-1 with the fourth T20I to be played in Napier and Boult is confident of putting in a good show and spearheading the New Zealand bowling attack with new-ball partner and stand-in skipper <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/tim_southee">Tim Southee</a>.</p>
      <p>"It's the same mindset that I always take into most formats: trying to be aggressive, trying to take wickets, and trying to do my role for the side," Boult told CricBuzz.</p>
      <p>"I'll try and do that [be aggressive] over the next couple of nights."</p>
      <p>Boult's absence from the national T20 team did not mean that he had lost contact with the format as he played the 2018 edition of the IPL and was impressive for the Delhi Capitals with 18 wickets. He knows that New Zealand are closing in on a series win and can make that possible if he is at his absolute best.</p>
      <p>"There's a series on the line here at the moment. And obviously I'm eager to come in and put my best step forward. It's a format that I haven't been involved in much at the international level over a period [of time], but I'm looking forward to coming in and trying to do my thing," Boult asserted.</p>
      <p>"Â It's 2-1 in the series, and hopefully we can put a good performance forward and seal off a nice victory in the series," he added.</p>
