      <p>Walt Disney Co's theme parks unit and a remake of "The Lion King" boosted quarterly earnings past Wall Street targets on Thursday as costs rose ahead of the launch of the company's big streaming entertainment bet.</p>
      <p>REUTERS: Walt Disney Co's theme parks unit and a remake of "The Lion King" boosted quarterly earnings past Wall Street targets on Thursday as costs rose ahead of the launch of the company's big streaming entertainment bet.</p>
      <p>Shares of Disney rose more than 3per cent to US$137.54 in after-hours trading.</p>

      <p>Disney is trying to transition from a cable TV leader to a powerhouse in the streaming video market dominated by Netflix Inc . Its family-friendly digital entertainment service, Disney+, is set to debut on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Excluding certain items, Disney earned US$1.07 per share for the quarter that ended in September, above average analyst estimates of 95 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>Speaking on CNBC television, Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger said the company had reached a deal to have Disney+ distributed on Amazon.com Inc's Fire TV devices.</p>
      <p>Investments to build streaming media services increased form a year earlier. The direct-to-consumer and international unit reported an operating loss of US$740 million from July through September, up from US$340 million the previous year, but less than the US$900 million that Disney had forecast.</p>
      <p>Disney+ will offer a deep library of TV shows and movies from Disney, Pixar Animation, Marvel Studios, the "Star Wars" franchise and the National Geographic Channel, plus original programming such as a new "High School Musical" series and a remake of "Lady and the Tramp." It will cost US$7 per month, less than the US$13 for Netflix's most popular plan.</p>
      <p>The offering is a cornerstone of a major shift in Disney's strategy to capture audiences that have ditched cable and migrated online. The company also offers ESPN+, which streams sports not seen on the ESPN cable channel, and recently took full control of online video service Hulu.</p>
      <p>At the same time, Disney is integrating film and TV businesses it purchased from 21st Century Fox to feed its digital ambition.</p>
      <p>At the theme parks and consumer products unit, operating income rose 17per cent to US$1.4 billion (Â£1.09 billion). Disney opened a costly "Star Wars"-themed land at Walt Disney World in Florida during the quarter. A nearly identical section debuted at Disneyland in California in May.</p>
      <p>The movie studio benefited from remakes of "The Lion King" and "Aladdin" plus Pixar sequel "Toy Story 4." Profit at the division jumped 79per cent to nearly US$1.1 billion.</p>
      <p>The company's media networks division posted a 3per cent decrease in operating income to US$1.8 billion, Disney said. Sports network ESPN experienced higher programming, production and marketing costs.</p>
      <p>Overall revenue rose 34per cent to US$19.10 billion, edging past analysts' average estimate of US$19.05 billion.</p>
