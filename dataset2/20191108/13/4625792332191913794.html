      <h1>Beto O’Rourke tells campaign staff he’ll ‘absolutely' stay in politics after failed presidential bid</h1>

      <p>In a farewell call to his staff, Beto O’Rourke told his supporters he will “absolutely” stay involved in politics.</p>
      <p>O’Rourke <u><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/beto-orourke-drops-out-of-2020-presidential-race">ended his presidential bid</a></u> last Friday after his campaign failed to recapture the momentum it had in its first weeks.</p>
      <p>Despite losing a senate race in 2018 and a presidential race in 2019, O’Rourke told his team he has no plans to stop being politically active.</p>
      <p>He told supporters he owes it to the American democratic process to stay involved.</p>
      <p>“Any of you out there who have run for office before and come up short — some part of you wants to go deep into a cave and never come out again,” he told his team. “That’s a natural part of the reaction, but I don’t think you get that pass in a democracy.”</p>
      <p>He claimed that watching future elections unfold from the sidelines would fail future generations.</p>
      <p>“This country is counting on all of us, and if any one of us fails to do our part to the best of our ability, then we will fail this country and the generations that follow that are counting on us,” he said.</p>
      <p>O’Rourke explained that he plans to help other Democrats up and down the ballot in 2020, but noted that he doesn’t know “in what capacity” that help will take place.</p>
      <p>He added, “All of us have to commit to get behind the nominee from this party to make sure that she or he is successful against Donald Trump and then to make sure that once they become president, they help to heal this very divided country.”</p>
      <p>O’Rourke entered the race positioned as a moderate candidate fresh off his Texas Senate bid but pivoted to the left after a mass shooting near his hometown of El Paso, Texas. His campaign promise to confiscate assault-style weapons was <u><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/beto-orourke-tears-into-schumer-for-doing-absolutely-nothing-on-guns">criticized by Republicans and Democrats</a></u>.</p>
