      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T13:14:12+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 13:14</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp has allayed fears over Virgil van Dijk ahead of Liverpool's clash with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> .</p>
      <p>Van Dijk missed training on Thursday, leading to fears he could miss the visit of the Premier League champions to Anfield.</p>
      <p>The defender returned to his homeland to meet and have lunch with the Dutch Royal Family.</p>
      <p>Speaking ahead of the visit of City, Klopp insisted: "Virg was for other reasons not here yesterday but is completely fine."</p>
      <p>Klopp also insisted Jordan Henderson is fit to start but Joel Matip remains sidelined, as does Xherdan Shaqiri.</p>

      <p>Klopp has also issued a rallying cry to Liverpool's supporters and believes they can make the difference inside Anfield on Sunday.</p>
      <p>"The improvement the boys have made is obvious. We have to play our best game on Sunday," Klopp said.</p>
      <p>"Absolutely in the stadium has to be in absolutely top shape, the guy who sells the hot dogs has to be in the top shape. Get early to the stadium, wait for the warm-up, be there.</p>

      <p>"It's a big game between two really good teams.</p>
      <p>"The good news it is at Anfield, that is cool. Floodlights. Big game.</p>
      <p>"We will see, everything is on a plate, so nobody hides. We cannot only be offensive but if we are not brave v Man City we have no chance. We have to create."</p>
      <p>"In the last two years it feels like each game we play is the most decisive of the season. There's not one where someone has said 'oh, you can lose that'."</p>
