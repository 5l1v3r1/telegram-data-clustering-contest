      <h2>The collapse of Thomas Cook meant more than just high street shops and planes were made available to buy - with Jet2.com taking advantage to bag extra airport take off and landing slots</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T13:42:25+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 13:42</time> by <a rel="author">James Andrews, http://www.facebook.com/jameswritesmoney/</a></address>
      <p>Jet2.com has bought Thomas Cook’s landing slots at Manchester, Birmingham and Stansted airports.</p>
      <p>Thomas Cook's liquidators didn't disclose how much Jet2 paid.</p>
      <p>Airport slots allow an airline to schedule a landing or departure during a specific time period - this means that Jet2's purchase of Thomas Cook's old ones will allow it to schedule more flights.</p>
      <p>Jet2 chief executive Steve Heapy said: “The acquisition of these key UK airport slots will play an important role in supporting our continued growth at Birmingham, London Stansted and Manchester Airports.”</p>
      <p>“We have been adding more flights and aircraft, resulting in increased capacity, at each of these bases for many years.</p>
      <p>"Today’s announcement is the latest demonstration of our commitment to providing holidaymakers with more choice and flexibility when it comes to flying to sun, city and ski destinations with our award-winning airline.”</p>

      <p>The news comes just hours after it was announced <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/breaking-easyjet-buys-thomas-cooks-20839609">easyJet has bought Thomas Cook's slots at Gatwick and Bristol airports</a> for £36million.</p>
      <p>Last month it emerged Hays Travel would buy all 555 remaining high street travel agents from Thomas Cook and look to re-employ hold of as many of its staff as possible.</p>
      <p>Ryanair is also taking advantage of Thomas Cook's collapse - using the opportunity to grow its Austrian brand Lauda by picking up pilots and planes.</p>
      <p>"With A320 aircraft and pilots recently released from the failure of Thomas Cook and Adria Airways, Lauda plans to grow from a fleet of 23 A320s in Spring-summer 209 to 38 for spring-summer 2020," Ryanair said earlier this month.</p>
