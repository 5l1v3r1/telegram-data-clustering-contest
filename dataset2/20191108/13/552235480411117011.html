      <h1>Brendan Rodgers reveals ultimate Celtic hope as he recalls his hardline Santa's grotto stance</h1>
      <h2>The Irishman also pinpointed why he believes he can rub people up the wrong way.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T13:57:45+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 13:57</time> by <a rel="author">Graeme Young, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/graeme-young/</a></address>
      <p>Optimistic <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/brendan-rodgers">Brendan Rodgers</a> is increasingly hopeful he will one day be welcomed back by Celtic fans scorned by his exit.</p>
      <p>The Irishman left the Hoops fanbase seething when he departed for Leicester in February with the club in the midst of a treble Treble chase.</p>
      <p>Neil Lennon answered the Celtic SOS and the 48-year-old is currently riding a crest of a wave after securing Europa League last 32 qualification with two games to spare after a storied 2-1 win over Lazio in Rome.</p>
      <p>But Rodgers' controversial move is also reaping rewards with the high-flying Foxes currently third in the Premier League.</p>

      <p>The former Liverpool boss has spoken in the past about supporters eventually coming round to his sudden exit and he believes it will be memories of his winning football that will eventually ease tensions.</p>
      <p>He told <a href="https://theathletic.co.uk/1351094/2019/11/08/james-rodgers/?redirected=1">The Athletic</a>: “People talk about a legacy, and it’s always visual what they talk about. For me, it’s about what people feel. So with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> , for example, we won seven trophies and we created history there.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"And once they take away how I left, hopefully there’s a feeling of, ‘That was a very good team. I loved going to watch them play and how they played.’</p>
      <p>“And for me here (at Leicester), it’s the same idea really. Hopefully there’s a feeling that the people are energised and inspired by watching the team.”</p>

      <p>Rodgers' passion for devising and overseeing every training session is well known, ditto his meticulous planning ahead of matchday.</p>
      <p>The Irishman, who keeps a binder for every pre-match tactical breakdown, admits his crystal clear vision is what has reaped rewards in coaching.</p>
      <p>And Rodgers reckons his burning desire to succeed can rub some people up the wrong way but insists he will never change his key principles in the search for success.</p>
      <p>He added: “I hope when I finish my career I’ll be respected as a coach, and people can judge me on being a coach, and what he did in terms of players’ improvement, teams’ improvement, supporters enjoying teams that I put out for them, and that is all I can ever worry about.</p>

      <p>“I think that sometimes where there is a British coach or a British manager who has an ambition, maybe there is something that is not liked.</p>
      <p>“But I always promise three things when I come into any club, with players and boards. I always promise my communication is open. I’ll give you quality in the work — I’ll be able to maximise your investment, improve and develop players. And I have ambition."</p>
      <p>And Rodgers' non-stop quest for success isn't a new phenomenon.</p>
      <p>The 47-year-old recalled a time during his days with Swansea, without their own training base, when he was asked whether his small office space would be made available for a Yuletide transformation.</p>
      <p>He added: “Around about mid-November, the leisure centre manager came up to me and said: ‘Brendan, will you be using the office — this area — on these dates in December?’</p>
      <p>“I said, ‘Well, I’ll need it all the time.’ He said: ‘It’s just that if you weren’t, we use this as Santa’s grotto."</p>
