      <p>US top diplomat Mike Pompeo, who is visiting Berlin to meet with his German counterpart Heiko Maas and negotiate with Chancellor Angela Merkel, is holding a speech dedicated to the 30th anniversary of the Berlin Wall's fall, a major event marking the end of the standoff between the East and the West.</p>
      <p>The wall, which became one of the symbols of the Cold War in Europe, was built in 1961 and separated the country until 1989, when the border was opened – just a year before the reunification of East and West Germany. The physical demolition of the wall officially began on 13 June 1990 and was completed in November 1991.</p>
