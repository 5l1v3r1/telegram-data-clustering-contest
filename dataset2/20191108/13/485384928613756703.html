      <h1>#MeToo-inspired comics anthology shines light on women cartoonists' experiences of sexual harassment, assault</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T13:13:06+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 13:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/teresa-tan/9250964" target="_blank">Teresa Tan</a></address>
      <p>In October 2017, the <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-10-16/what-is-the-metoo-campaign/9055926">#MeToo movement went viral</a> and an avalanche of high-profile sexual assault allegations dominated headlines. Women and artists all over the world were responding in their own ways — and for US cartoonist and editor Diane Noomin, that meant words and pictures.</p>
      <p>A key figure in the underground comics scene, she invited other women cartoonists to illustrate their personal experiences of sexual assault, harassment and rape culture.</p>
      <p>Released in late September this year, Drawing Power: Women's Stories of Sexual Violence, Harassment, and Survival features 63 visual testimonies from women of diverse ages, sexualities and backgrounds, from around the world.</p>
      <p>Edited by Noomin, the non-fiction comics anthology calls "upon the power of storytelling and comics art to confront sexual trauma", as she writes in the preface.</p>

      </p>
      <p>In US cartoonist Lee Marrs's 1968 flashback Got Over It, a neighbour trespasses into her home and justifies assaulting her by saying: "You're asking for it — in that bathing suit!" She fights him off.</p>
      <p>On another page, a gaggle of male club go-ers aggressively surround and intimidate UK comics maker Bridget Meyne in the bathroom and demand a kiss.</p>
      <p>Other vignettes tackle incest and catcalling.</p>
      <blockquote>"The artists in this collection present themselves not as victims but rather as truth tellers, shining light on the dirty secrets of abusers," Noomin writes.</blockquote>
      <p>The list of contributors features underground comics luminary Aline Kominsky-Crumb, 2018 Eisner Award winner Emil Ferris, ethnographer Ebony Flowers — and three Australian comics artists: Rachel Ang, Sarah Firth and Meg O'Shea.</p>

      <h3>'That's why you draw, right?'</h3>
      <p>Melbourne-based comics artist Rachel Ang had never spoken to anyone beyond her therapist about the abusive relationship she depicts in Destroy Everything You Touch.</p>

      <p>Initially she was unsure of contributing a story to Noomin's anthology: "I didn't want to draw myself in that position," she says.</p>
      <p>"I'd done a lot of really hard emotional work to not be that person anymore."</p>
      <p>Ang says she is not an angry person, but found herself scrapping her "poetic" first drafts in order "to be a lot more direct and angry".</p>
      <p>"I don't think of myself as a victim anymore, I am the older person who is looking back, is angry and wants justice. That is the real me," she says.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Destroy Everything You Touch is about knowing an abuser is continuing their toxic behaviour and preying on other young women.</p>
      <p>"And [he] just gets to live and go through life making other people miserable, you know? He destroys."</p>
      <p>Ang has found a sense of power in defining herself and her story.</p>
      <blockquote>"Drawing allows you to be the author of yourself and people can't take that away from me. It gives you a sense of agency."</blockquote>
      <p>As a medium, she believes that comics can communicate something that cannot be articulated in words alone, helping her to make sense of the world.</p>
      <p>"That's why you draw, right?"</p>
      <h3>'A gut punch and rally cry all at once'</h3>

      <p>In Sausage Fest, Melbourne-based comics creator Sarah Firth depicts a toxic workplace where a culture of sexual harassment was allowed to fester. With each panel, the harassment escalates: from inappropriate language and intimidation by way of a crudely defaced staff photo of Firth, to a Stanley knife left on her chair, and copper pipes spelling out the word 'slut' on the floor.</p>
      <p>Firth's mother cried after reading her daughter's story, later sharing that she too had experienced harassment and intimidation in the workplace in her early 20s. She was eventually bullied out of a career in physics.</p>
      <p>Firth says her mother isn't an "emotional personal" but as a woman in her mid-70s, she was saddened to see that a generation on, while things have changed, they haven't changed a lot.</p>

      </p>
      <p>"That's why these stories are so important," Firth says.</p>
      <blockquote>"It's only when others see their stories out there that there is a sense of permission and acknowledgement that what has happened to them and others is actually not OK."</blockquote>
      <p>Drawing Power is not an easy read, but an important one.</p>
      <p>After reading it cover to cover, Firth says: "I feel sad. I feel proud. I feel so angry. I feel like it's like a gut punch and a rally cry all at once."</p>
      <p>As the Melbourne-based contributor puts it, the book lets the reader really see "the root of the pain" in each story.</p>
      <p>"There's this vulnerability, empathy and 'being seen-ness' that is gut wrenching, heart wrenching, but also really empowering, because it's so true and so honest."</p>
      <h3>More than an online joke</h3>
      <p>South-Korea-based artist Meg O'Shea says she draws comics as a way "to document and work through things that have happened [to me]".</p>
      <figure>

      <p>In Asian Girls, her contribution to Drawing Power, she examines the festishisation of Asian women.</p>
      <p>"I faced particular treatment because of my race back home in Australia," says O'Shea, citing in particular "a build-up of racist jokes".</p>
      <p>This played a role in her decision to move to South Korea, where she is <a href="https://thenib.com/a-part-of-me-is-still-unknown">exploring "being Korean" and her "existence as an adoptee"</a>.</p>
      <p>"I talked about a lot of stuff [in Asian Girls] that I would find incredibly difficult to speak to people about, in real life," she says.</p>
      <blockquote>"If someone finds you attractive because of your race — something you have absolutely no control over — it's a very reductive way to be considered."</blockquote>
      <p>She sees this dynamic play out in South Korean bars: "There is a trope here of guys from overseas really digging Korean women because of stereotypes like submissive behaviour."</p>

      </p>
      <p>Like Ang, O'Shea was hesitant to contribute a story to Drawing Power.</p>
      <p>"I guess I'm scared of a backlash," she says.</p>
      <blockquote>"There are just so many highly publicised negative repercussions for women who talk about their own experiences of harassment and abuse."</blockquote>
      <p>Despite this, O'Shea acknowledges the importance of seeing your experiences reflected in others.</p>
      <p>"It helps reduce feelings of isolation," she says, hoping that by sharing her story, one less person might feel alone.</p>
      <h3>'We all deserve better'</h3>

      </p>
      <p>US cultural commentator and author Roxane Gay penned an introduction for the Drawing Power anthology.</p>
      <p>In it, she says: "By using the power of drawing, [these artists] show us the condition of the lives they have lived, the condition of our culture, and the vital work we must do to render the need for an anthology like this obsolete.</p>
      <p>Ang was gripped by fear and anxiety ahead of the book's launch in Melbourne, and says: "I still wouldn't want my parents to read my story. I think that they would, in some sense, blame me for what happened."</p>
      <p>But despite this, she hopes that when women read Drawing Power, they too will recognise: "It's not you. You are not the problem. You didn't deserve for this [bad thing] to happen to you.</p>
      <p>"This is systemic. It's the society that we live in. You did nothing to deserve abuse, harassment or rape."</p>
      <p>It's a sentiment Firth echoes</p>
      <p>"We all deserve better," she says.</p>
