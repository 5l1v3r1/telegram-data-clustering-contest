      <h2>In June, the think tank RAND ("Research ANd Development") said that the greatest danger to the United States and its allies from the Russian Armed Forces is the possibility of a major land war.</h2>

      <p>The Russian Armed Forces possess enormous capabilities in their ability to quickly deploy ground forces and air defences and deliver nuclear and non-nuclear strikes at strategic ranges, according to <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2573.html">a report</a> by the American research centre RAND ("Research ANd Development").</p>
      <p>The report stated that as part the modernisation of its armed forces, the country created well-protected bulwarks in a number of locations, in particular, in <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911061077234320-former-us-diplomat-calls-on-washington-to-review-status-of-crimea/">the Crimea</a>, the Kaliningrad Region, and the Kuril Islands. The document notes that these positions can absorb the first blow in the event of a military conflict involving Russia, allowing for retaliatory training of the military inside the country, as well as being used by Moscow to "threaten its neighbours".</p>
      <p>In October, Richard Hooker, a senior researcher at the Jamestown Foundation (USA), published a report according to which a potential military conflict between Russia and NATO countries in the Baltic States would primarily lead to the loss of the Kaliningrad Region.</p>
      <p>Jeffrey Harrigan, Commander of the United States Air Force in Europe, said in September that the Pentagon has a plan to break through the multi-layer air defence of the Kaliningrad Region.</p>
