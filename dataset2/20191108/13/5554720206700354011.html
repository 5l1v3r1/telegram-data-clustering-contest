      <p>Unable to convince partner Shiv Sena, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis resigned from his post on Friday. He met the Governor to submit his resignation. The incumbent chief minister drove to Raj Bhavan in south Mumbai and submitted his resignation to Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari.</p>

      <p>Moments later, a visibly exasperated chief minister addressed the media expressing his disappointment over his party’s inability to persuade the Shiv Sena to form a coalition government headed by him.</p>
      <p>Speaking to reporters, Fadnavis denied that the 50:50 formula was ever discussed between the two parties ahead of the elections. He also said that he had made several phone calls to Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray but the latter had refused to answer his calls.</p>
      <p>Ever since the assembly polls were announced on 24 October, the Shiv Sena has been demanding the implementation of what it said was a 50:50 formula whereby both coalition partners will have their chief ministers for half the term each.</p>
      <p>The Shiv Sena and BJP alliance had won 161 out of 288 seats in the state assembly. In the polls, the BJP won 105 seats, Shiv Sena-56, NCP-54 and the Congress won 44 seats.</p>
      <p>The term of the current assembly session is ending on 9 November. If the parties are unable to stake their claims on the government formation by the deadline, then the Governor can impose President’s Rule in the state.</p>
