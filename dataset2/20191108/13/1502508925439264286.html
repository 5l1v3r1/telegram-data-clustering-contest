      <p>Saugata Gupta, MD and CEO of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/marico">Marico </a>Ltd and Vipin Sondhi, former MD and CEO-India, South East Asia &amp; Pacific of JCB Ltd will be joining Ashok Leyland's Board.</p>
      <p>Gupta will be an independent director and Sondhi will be a director in the Board, said the company.</p>
      <p>Dheeraj Hinduja, chairman, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ashok-leyland">Ashok Leyland </a>said, "The induction of both Saugata and Vipin into the Board of Directors at <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ashok-leyland">Ashok Leyland </a>will add significant strategic depth to the company given their rich and unique experience across the FMCG and Automotive sectors in lndia and international markets. I look forward to collaborating closely with them to help achieve Ashok Leyland's vision to be amongst the top 10 commercial vehicle manufacturers globally".</p>
      <p>Gupta is credited with transforming <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/marico">Marico </a>into a high-performing business, responsible for driving growth and operations both in lndia and across international markets, with a commitment to sustainable development, it said.</p>
      <p>Sondhi, whose appointment into Hinduja Group's leadership team earlier in August 2019, is to focus on consolidation, growth and future strategy of Hinduja Group's global automotive portfolio.</p>
      <p>He will formally join the Hinduja Group later this month from JCB, where he is the MD &amp; CEO - India, South East Asia &amp; Pacific and a member of their Global Executive Leadership Team.</p>
      <p>The development comes at a time the company is in the process of appointing MD&amp;CEO.</p>
      <p>Hinduja said they are in the final announcement of company's new CEO.</p>
