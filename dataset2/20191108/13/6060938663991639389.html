The much-awaited Rumi Jaffery mystery-thriller was initially set to lock horns with <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Vicky-Kaushal">Vicky Kaushal</a>'s horror film 'Bhoot Part One: The Haunted Ship’ and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Anurag-Basu">Anurag Basu</a>'s yet-to-be-titled film which stars <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Abhishek-Bachchan">Abhishek Bachchan</a> and Aditya Roy Kapur in lead roles.</p>
