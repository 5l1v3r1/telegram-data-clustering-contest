      <p>An American <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/general/airlines">Airlines</a> flight from Charlotte, N.C., to Salt Lake City, Utah, was diverted to Tulsa International <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/general/airports">Airport</a> late on Tuesday night after a "disruptive passenger" allegedly assaulted a mother and daughter.</p>
      <p>The mother and daughter reportedly notified a flight attendant of the man’s behavior, claiming that he groped both of them while they slept, according to <a href="https://www.fox23.com/news/man-arrested-at-tia-accused-of-groping-woman-and-her-daughter-on-flight/1006133325">Fox 23</a>. The pair was subsequently separated from the man by the crew as the flight prepared to divert.</p>
