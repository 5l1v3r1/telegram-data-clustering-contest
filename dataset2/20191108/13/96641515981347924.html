      <h1>'Death Stranding' for PC will come to both Epic Games Store and Steam</h1>
      <h2>You won't have to be picky about where you buy Kojima's magnum opus.</h2>

      <p>When you heard that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-07-death-stranding-is-a-great-movie.html"><i>Death Stranding</i></a> was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/28/death-stranding-pc-summer-2020/">coming to PCs</a> next summer, did you cringe at the rumors that it might be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/04/03/epic-to-continue-game-store-exclusives/">yet another</a> Epic Games Store exclusive? You can relax. Kojima Productions and 505 Games have <a href="https://505games.com/hideo-kojimas-death-stranding-available-to-pre-order-on-pc-now/">confirmed</a> that the game will be available through both <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1190460/Death_Stranding/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/death-stranding/home">Epic's store</a> at the same time for $60 (Â£55) when it's ready in summer 2020. You can already pre-order if you're intrigued by the game's genre-bending mechanics and big-name acting talent.</p>
      <p>It's a mild surprise in an era when game developers frequently choose only one major store for PC releases (or accept timed exclusives), but it makes sense for a title like this. While <i>Death Stranding</i> is Kojima Productions' first game, it's a high-profile release from a legendary game designer -- Kojima and crew don't need the monetary perks that would come with a PC exclusive. This also ensures that as many people can play on PC as possible, whether or not they're 'loyal' to Steam.</p>
