      <p>Thousands of high school students across Lebanon skipped classes Friday for a third day in a row to carry on the flame of the country's anti-graft movement.<br/><br/>Lebanon has since October 17 been gripped by massive cross-sectarian protests demanding a complete revamping of a political system they say is corrupt and inept.<br/><br/>With youth unemployment running at over 30 percent, school students have joined en masse since Wednesday demanding a better country so they don't have to emigrate.<br/><br/>In Beirut, a teenage student who gave her name as Qamar was among thousands of pupils chanting slogans outside the ministry of education on Friday, AFP reported.<br/><br/>"So what if we lose a school year compared to our entire future?" she said. "I don't want to study in Lebanon and then have to travel abroad" to find a job.<br/><br/>Around her, students waved red-green-and-white Lebanese flags, as others set off yellow, green, blue and purple flares into the sky.<br/><br/>"We missed classes to kick your asses," read one poster in English.<br/><br/>Across Lebanon, students protested outside state institutions and banks including in the southern city of Saida, Tripoli in the north and the east's Baalbek.<br/><br/>What started as a spontaneous and leaderless movement has become more organised in recent days, with protesters targeting institutions viewed as particularly inefficient or corrupt.<br/><br/>Early Friday, dozens of activists and retired army officers for the first time briefly closed down the entrance to Beirut's port.<br/><br/>According to AFP, Lebanon's cabinet stepped down last week but no official consultations have started on forming a new government, and outgoing premier Saad Hariri remains in a caretaker capacity.</p>
