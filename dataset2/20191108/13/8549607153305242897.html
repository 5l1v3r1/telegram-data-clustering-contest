        <b>Head of Calibra, the Libra cryptocurrency wallet, David Marcus, stated that bitcoin is a digital equivalent of gold and not to be considered as a currency. Per a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/06/facebook-executive-david-marcus-says-bitcoin-is-an-investment-not-currency.html?__source=twitter%7Cmain">report</a> by </b>

        <b> on November 6, 2019, the Calibra Chief opined that BTC was not a good medium of exchange. </b>
      </p>
      <h3>Bitcoin is Digital Gold, Not Currency</h3>
      <p>Speaking at the New York Times DealBook Conference held in New York, Marcus spoke about Libra, the stablecoin introduced by the blue and white Menlo Park-based messaging giant Facebook, regulatory backlash faced by the team, among other topics.  </p>
      <p>When asked about his opinion on bitcoin, the Calibra chief stated that the number one digital currency is a digital equivalent of gold. </p>
      <p>Marcus buttressed the opinion, saying: </p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>“I don’t think of bitcoin as a currency. It is actually not a great medium of exchange because of its volatility. I see it as digital gold.”</b>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The Calibra head further stressed that bitcoin’s volatility is the major reason people do not use the digital currency to purchase items. Also, the flagship virtual currency does not pose a threat, because it is “decorrelated from the rest of the market.”</p>
      <p>Though the jury is still out of bitcoin’s suitability as both a store of value and medium of exchange, several commentators like Twitter chief Jack Dorsey have stated that the top-ranked crypto is <a href="https://btcmanager.com/jack-dorsey-twitter-libra-decentralized-protocols/">odds on favorite</a> to become the de facto native currency of the internet.</p>
      <p>Already, bitcoin is seeing <a href="https://btcmanager.com/bitcoin-price-rise-venezuela/?q=/bitcoin-price-rise-venezuela/&amp;">massive adoption</a> in areas experiencing economic stress. BTC is also experiencing increasing usage in cross-border transactions, especially in countries with strict capital controls. </p>
      <p>Furthermore, it could be argued that Marcus’ comments seem ironic given that the proposed Libra currency is seen by some as a walled garden under the control of a few privately-held companies. Bitcoin by distinction runs on an immutable consensus network. </p>
      <h4>Regulatory Headaches Still Linger for Libra</h4>
      <p>While Marcus considers bitcoin as just gold’s digital equivalent, the European Union is planning on banning cryptocurrencies like Libra, that in its opinion, are “too risky.” According to a <i>Reuters </i><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-cryptocurrency-regulations/alarmed-by-libra-eu-to-look-into-issuing-public-digital-currency-draft-idUSKBN1XF1VC">report</a>, the EU in a draft document recommended that the European Central Bank (ECB) create a digital currency. </p>
      <p>Per a report on <i>BTCManager </i>recently, five members of the EU, including France and Germany among others, formed an <a href="https://btcmanager.com/europe-five-largest-economies-libra/">anti-Libra coalition</a> that would make it near impossible for Libra to function in Europe. The coalition echoes the sentiments of the French Minister, Bruno Le Maire, who <a href="https://btcmanager.com/france-finance-minister-libra-cryptocurrency-europe/">vowed</a> not to allow Facebook’s cryptocurrency to develop in Europe. </p>
