      <h2>The 39 people who were found in the back of a lorry in an industrial estate in Grays have been named by Essex Police as the investigation into their deaths continues</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T13:37:39+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 13:37</time> by <a rel="author">Milo Boyd, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/milo-boyd/</a></address>
      <p>All 39 people who were found dead in the back of a lorry in Essex have now been named.</p>
      <p>Sixteen days after police officers found the pile of bodies in the back of the refrigerated lorry trailer in the early hours of October 23, the names, ages and origins of all the victims have been made public for the first time.</p>
      <p>As feared by several traumatised communities in the south Asian country, all those who tragically lost their lives were from Vietnam.</p>
      <p>The victims include 10 teenagers and 31 people who were from the Ha Tinh region.</p>
      <p>The horrific discovery was made on an industrial estate in Grays.</p>
      <p>Nguyen Huy Hung and Dinh Dinh Binh were both just 15-years-old.</p>
      <p>The senior officer in charge of the enquiry, Assistant Chief Constable at Essex Police Tim Smith, spoke about the challenges the force faced when it came to identifying the victims.</p>

      <p>He said: “This was an incredibly important process and our team has been working hard to bring answers to worried families who fear their loved one may be among those whose tragic journey ended on our shores.</p>
      <p>“Our priority has been to identify the victims, to preserve the dignity of those who have died and to support the victims’ friends and families.</p>
      <p>“It remained of paramount importance to us to ensure that an individual’s next of kin were informed, and that they were given some time to absorb this tragic news before we publicly confirmed their loved one’s identity.</p>
      <p>“We have worked closely with the National Crime Agency, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and the Vietnamese Authorities to identify and locate their families."</p>

        <figcaption>Pham Thi Tra My was 26-years-old when she died</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Pham Thi Tra My's family from Ha Tinh paid roughly £30,000 for her to travel to UK in a bid to start a new life.</p>
      <p>She messaged them on Tuesday night - hours before the 39 bodies were found - and said: "I am really, really sorry, Mum and Dad, my trip to a foreign land has failed.</p>
      <p>"I am dying, I can't breathe. I love you very much Mum and Dad. I am sorry, Mother."</p>
      <p>Her family had begged her not to go and "tried to talk her out of it because it would be a very difficult journey for her as a girl".</p>

      <p>The family of teenager Anna Bui Thi Nhung claim she had paid £8,000 in the hope of a new life in Britain working in a nail bar.</p>
      <p>Anna's family, who live in the village of Yen Thanh in north-central Vietnam, resigned themselves to the fact she is one of the deceased before the beginning of November.</p>
      <p>Her mother has been left bed-ridden with grief as they wait for news, while a makeshift shrine has also been created for the teen.</p>

      <p>Nguyen Dinh Tu had been working illegally in Romania and Germany before he lost his job.</p>
      <p>The blow led him to ask his wife Hoang Thi Thuong to help raise £11,000 to cover the cost of a trip from Germany to the United Kingdom where he hoped to find work.  </p>
      <p>"I lost contact with him on October 21," his devastated wife said.</p>
      <p>"I have a big debt to pay, no hope, and no energy to do anything".</p>

      <p>Nguyen Dinh Gia said he was told by his son Nguyen Dinh Lurong two weeks before the journey that he planned to travel from France to Britain.</p>
      <p>He said was going to pay around £11,000 for the journey and hoped to work in a nail salon when he arrived.</p>
      <p>But his father claims he received a call several days ago from a Vietnamese man saying: "'Please have some sympathy, something unexpected happened'."</p>
      <p>Gia added: "I fell to the ground when I heard that.</p>
      <p>"It seemed that he was in the truck with the accident, all of them dead."</p>

      <p>Hoang Van Tiep left home two years ago after his family got a £13,500 loan to pay for him to travel to Russia and on to France.  </p>
      <p>He had left his family in Yen Thanh to risk his life getting into the UK. </p>
      <p>His father Hoag said his teenager son had also told him that he would be travelling by taxi to the UK. The family had raised the £17,500 to pay people smugglers get the teen into the UK.</p>

      <p>Hung Nguyen, 33, had been working in France as a dishwasher before his trip to Britain. </p>
      <p>His family paid smugglers £13,400 last year to get him to France, and were asked for a similar amount last week.</p>
      <p>He was reunited with his cousin Hoang Van Tiep for the final leg of the journey to Britain.</p>

      <p>Le Van Ha left his poor and agricultural village in Vietnam in search of a better life in the UK.</p>
      <p>His father Le Minh Tuan was captured in a heartbreaking photo that shows the agony etched upon his face as he sobs while clutching his young grandson.</p>
      <p>"He's left us with a huge debt," he said.</p>
      <p>"I don't know when we can ever pay it back. I'm an old man now, my health is poor, and I have to help bring up his children."</p>

        <figcaption>Nguyen Huy Hung</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Nguyen Huy Hung is believed to be the youngest victim of the tragedy.</p>
      <p>His older sister claims the 15-year-old had longed to be reunited with his parents Nguyen Huy Tung and Nyguen Thi Huyen.</p>
      <p>She revealed he had spent the past two months travelling to the UK to see them</p>
      <p>Formal identification has been established via an Identification Commission, overseen by Her Majesty’s Senior Coroner for Essex, Caroline Beasley-Murray.</p>
      <p>She said: "May I take this opportunity to offer my deepest condolences to the victims’ families. My thoughts are with them at this unimaginably difficult time.”</p>
      <p>The victims were found dead inside the container at an industrial estate in Grays, Essex, in the early hours of October 23 after it arrived on a ferry from Zeebrugge, Belgium.</p>
      <p>The ferry landed at a port in Purfleet and paramedics and police were called to the industrial estate, where the trailer was found attached to a lorry, just over an hour later.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old driver of the lorry, Mo Robinson, of Craigavon in Co Armagh, Northern Ireland, has been charged with 39 counts of manslaughter, conspiracy to traffic people, conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration and money laundering.</p>
      <p>Police have started extradition proceedings to bring 22-year-old Eamonn Harrison from Ireland, where he is in custody, to the UK.</p>

      <p>Harrison, of Newry in Co Down, Northern Ireland, faces charges of 39 counts of manslaughter, along with human trafficking and immigration offences. </p>
      <p>Detectives have also urged Ronan Hughes, 40, and his brother Christopher, 34, said to have links with the road haulage and shipping industries, to hand themselves in.</p>
      <p>The pair, from Armagh in Northern Ireland, are wanted on suspicion of manslaughter and human trafficking.</p>
      <p>Three other people arrested in connection with the incident - two men aged 38 and 46 and a 38-year-old woman - have been released on bail.</p>
      <p>Vietnamese authorities have arrested two people in Ha Tinh province and nine in Nghe An.</p>
      <p>They face charges of organising people smuggling overseas.</p>
      <p>An official from the Nghe An police force told Vietnamese media on Thursday that the bodies would be flown from the UK to Noi Bai airport in the capital Hanoi.</p>
      <p>The bodies will then be handed over to families for burial.</p>
