      <h1>Michael O'Neill Stoke double duty as boss makes Northern Ireland concession</h1>
      <h2>O'Neill was announced as the new Potters manager after the the recent sacking of Nathan Jones.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T13:22:45+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 13:22</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Doyle, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/chris-doyle/</a></address>
      <p>New Stoke boss <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/michael-oneill">Michael O'Neill</a> will still take charge of Northern Ireland for their remaining Euro 2020 games against Holland and Germany and any potential qualifiers in March - despite joining the Potters.</p>
      <p>The Championship side announced O'Neill's arrival after the recent sacking of Nathan Jones.</p>
      <p>The 50-year-old guided the national side to the last 16 of Euro 2016 and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/northern-ireland-football-team">Northern Ireland</a> hopes he can help them achieve that same feat as they were able to negotiate his return in the short-term as he departed for Stoke.</p>
      <p>Irish chief executive Patrick Nelson said: "We reluctantly agreed to allow <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/stoke-city-fc">Stoke</a> to talk to Michael after they met the compensation requirements. Michael has now agreed terms with the Championship club.</p>

      <p>"Naturally, we are extremely disappointed that Michael is leaving us, however we are delighted all parties have agreed Michael will be in charge of the Northern Ireland team for the games against Holland and Germany and potential <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/euro-2020">Euro 2020</a> play-off matches in March.</p>
      <p>"Everyone in the GAWA family is grateful for Michael's inspirational contribution over the past eight years. After a difficult start to his managerial reign with Northern Ireland he honed an excellent squad and took us to the round of 16 at Euro 2016, our first major tournament in 30 years.</p>
      <p>"And, of course, he also took us to a play-off for World Cup Russia 2018 and the team have performed extremely well during the Euro 2020 qualification campaign.</p>
      <p>"He has instilled incredible belief among our players and inspired countless young people to play football and aspire to play for Northern Ireland. He has also given our wonderful fans plenty to cheer about in recent years."</p>
