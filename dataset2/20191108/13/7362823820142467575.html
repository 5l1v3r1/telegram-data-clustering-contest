      <p>The sudden incident caused the Airbus A320’s inflatable slide to deploy on the tarmac, as 86 horrified passengers “screamed” in confusion, according to the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/drunk-passenger-rips-plane-door-20838507">Daily Mirror</a>. The offender was quickly pinned down by aviation officials, removed from the plane and detained.</p>
      <p>Local media described the man as a “crazed foreigner” who was “allegedly intoxicated,” per the Mirror. His door-destroying stunt is said to have caused over $19,700 in damage.</p>

      <p>Though flight WE169 was scheduled to depart at 3:40 p.m., the incident delayed takeoff by about an hour and twenty minutes, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/travel/10303383/drunk-passenger-thailand-plane-door?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=sharebarweb">The Sun</a> reports, as officials investigated and safely closed the emergency exit door.</p>

      <p>On behalf of Thai Smile, a subsidiary of Thai Airways, a spokesperson for the parent company apologized for the unexpected turn of events.</p>
      <p>''The incident occurred when the plane was about to depart from Chiang Mai International Airport for Suvarnabhumi International Airport in Bangkok,” they said. ''After the aircraft door had been successfully closed there was a wait for a taxi to take off.</p>
      <p>''A foreign male passenger ran to open the emergency exit door next to the left wing of the plane. The incident caused the emergency door to be opened entirely and an emergency slide unfolded,” the spokesperson continued.</p>
