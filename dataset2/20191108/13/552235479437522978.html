      <p>“You don’t need to be a problem drinker for alcohol to cause problems in your life. It can affect your health, your family, your work and you might not be aware of the scale of the impact”.</p>
      <p>That’s the stark message from the chief executive of a Dumbarton-based support group ahead of Alcohol Awareness Week which starts on Monday, November 11.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Dumbarton Area Council on Alcohol (DACA) aims to help people and their families affected by alcohol misuse and Mags Mackenzie is determined to spread the message to the wider community.</p>
      <p>They will have a stall in the Chest Heart and Stroke Community Hub in Dumbarton High Street on Wednesday, November 13 and are also hosting a series of other events across the area which will include therapy tasters, quizzes and information stalls.</p>
      <p>The events are all part of the national Alcohol Awareness Week which, this year, focuses on the impact alcohol has on our bodies, our lives and our loves.</p>
      <p>Mags, explained: “Alcohol is a legal drug. It’s ingrained in our culture in Scotland so it can make it difficult for people to recognise when it is having a negative impact on their lives.</p>
      <p>“People who are drinking between 14 and 35 units of alcohol a week are often very surprised to learn that their drinking is at a level where they are building up some health harms even although they tend to be unseen.</p>
      <p>“Alcohol is connected to over 60 health disorders, including seven different types of cancer.</p>
      <p>“People are generally surprised that having a glass of wine a night — which they don’t see as problematic — puts them into a harmful drinking habit.</p>
      <p>“We have got to give people informed choices.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Although alcohol is associated with socialising and relaxation, it is also a depressant. DACA’s steps to wellbeing team will be joining some of the pop-up sessions to offer therapeutic tasters as a healthy alternative to booze.</p>
      <p>Mags added: “Our steps to wellbeing team provide a range of complementary therapies. They have been offering this service to people accessing support at DACA for nearly a year and the benefits it has both on drinking and overall wellbeing are significant.”</p>
      <p>In addition to the steps to wellbeing team, DACA offers a range of other groups which help engage people in a more positive way.</p>
      <p>Mags went on: “Not everyone needs to have a really complex long-term counselling relationship.</p>
      <p>“We tell people about counselling services, peer support, social groups and diversionary activities and sometimes that’s helpful.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes just being part of a group of people who have the same focus in changing their behaviour and having some peer support and maybe a bit of company is what they need.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Although their focus during Alcohol Awareness Week is on making the wider community think about what they are drinking, DACA continue their day-to-day work with people who have already engaged with them for support.</p>
      <p>Mags continued: “Here at DACA, we deal with people at both ends of the spectrum, including people who are dependent on alcohol and are in the risk category for experiencing significant harms including death.</p>
      <p>“That tends to be more older adults — usually men.”</p>
      <p>However the chief executive does acknowledge that other groups are at risk.</p>
      <p>She added: “There’s quite an increase in terms of younger, professional women drinking. A lot of the alcohol marketing is targeted towards women.</p>
      <p>“We try and dispel some of the myths that people have and misinformation that exists around drinking.”</p>
      <p>Although drug deaths are seen as the scourge of Scotland following shock figures published earlier this year, in West Dunbartonshire, there were more alcohol-specific deaths than drug fatalities for 2018.</p>
      <p>Thirty four people died as a result of alcohol throughout the year across the region, with 20 dying as a result of drugs.</p>
      <p>In a bid to address this on a national level, the introduction of the minimum price of alcohol came into effect in May last year, making it illegal for Scottish shops, off licences and supermarkets to sell alcohol for less than 50p per unit.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Mags says this hasn’t had the negative effect which was feared as there was concern people may turn to other substances or even produce their own alcohol to offset this.</p>
      <p>However she says, since its introduction, DACA has seen an increase in need for its service.</p>
      <p>She explained: “Clients aren’t telling us they are feeling significant impact and the official early statistics are positive.</p>
      <p>“We also expected that there would be an uptake in services like ours and we have had that.”</p>
