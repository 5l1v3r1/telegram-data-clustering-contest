      <h1>2 prime Real Madrid targets flatly turn down Barcelona’s offers</h1>

      <h3>Real Madrid’s transfer ambitions have been handed a massive boost after two players targeted even by Barcelona have rejected the Catalans.</h3>
      <p>Barcelona are having all kinds of problems right now. Ernesto Valverde is unable to get the best out of the side and faces the sack, while the club’s most recent transfers such as Ousmane Dembele, Philippe Coutinho and Antoine Griezmann who were all signed for over 100 million euros each have not lived up to the reputation and expectation.</p>
      <p>Lionel Messi is now 32, but it always looks as if the whole team is over reliant on him. Nearly every passage of play heavily involves the Argentina international and a roster with Barca’s quality must certainly not be banking on a one-man show for most of the season. To make things worse, Busquets, Pique and Suarez- the core of the team- are depleting too.</p>
      <p>Real Madrid and Barcelona have been battling each other for two mutual targets- Fabian Ruiz and Kylian Mbappe. <a href="https://www.diariogol.com/fcbarcelona/muy-fuerte-no-quiere-hundirse-con-messi-en-el-barca-y-prefiere-irse-con-zidane-al-real-madrid_20008049_102.html"><b>Diario GOL</b></a> has now provided news that will further deject most of the Catalans’ faithful, claiming that the duo prefers to negotiate and take things further with Real Madrid instead of the defending La Liga champions who they see as a sinking side.</p>
      <p>Napoli’s Fabian Ruiz has been seen as a replacement for Andres Iniesta due to his supreme attacking style of play. Barca are yet to replace the Vissel Kobe man, and even though they did sign Arthur Melo and Frenkie de Jong over the last two summers, the two youngsters are players who are more similar to Xavi than they are to Iniesta.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Mbappe is an in-demand European sensation and has been on Real Madrid’s radar since the last few years. Barca look at the record breaking teenager as a replacement to Lionel Messi, but even Mbappe prefers to play for the Whites who seem to have a much stable future squad and project as compared to the Blaugrana who look bleak from a few corners.</p>
      <p>Which other players must the Blaugrana now look at over potential transfers in the coming months?</p>
