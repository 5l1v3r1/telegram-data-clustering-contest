      <h1>Lionel Messi vetoes Barcelona president’s choice of new coach</h1>

      <h3>Barcelona boss Ernesto Valverde may not be in the club’s dugout by the end of this year and a hunt for replacements has already begun.</h3>
      <p>Barcelona host Celta Vigo in Saturday’s La Liga clash at the Camp Nou. After two winless matches, the Catalans are expected to bounce back in front of their own faithful but they may receive a hostile reception which will be in light of the recent performances and particularly directed at first-team coach Ernesto Valverde.</p>
      <p>Levante and Slavia Prague both managed to pull out results versus the Blaugrana against the odds and there were demands for Valverde to be thrown out during the week. However, it looks like the Barca board will keep the manager for another month, with December 18 being the landmark date until the 55 year old can save his job.</p>
      <p>Ronald Koeman is thought to be Barca’s prime choice to be in the dugout as Valverde’s replacement, but the Dutchman will only pay attention to the Blaugrana once the Euro 2020 campaign for Netherlands is over next summer. Marcelo Gallardo is another option, but he is not a very proven manager to be managing a club of Barcelona’s calibre.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.diariogol.com/fcbarcelona/sustituto-bomba-para-valverde-bartomeu-lo-elige-y-messi-no-lo-quiere-en-el-barca_20008160_102.html"><b>Diario GOL has reported</b></a> that Ajax Amsterdam manager Erik ten Hag has been shortlisted as another replacement by the Camp Nou outfit. The Eredivisie champions employ a similar playing style like that of Barca, so it is no secret that he is also one of their options. Moreover, the fairy tale campaign that he led his side to in 2018/19 has still left many in awe.</p>
      <p>Lionel Messi has apparently vetoed the Ajax Amsterdam manager’s move, and even the boss himself stated last week that he will stay with his current employer until the end of this season. Messi is thought to be in favour of Ronald Koeman or Marcelo Gallardo, but is almost certainly against Valverde staying for a much longer time with the club.</p>
      <p>Do you think Erik ten Hag will be able to lead the Catalans to the summit of Europe?</p>
