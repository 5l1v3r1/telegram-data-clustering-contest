      <h1>Iran downs unidentified drone near Gulf coast: reports</h1>

      <p><b>TEHRAN: </b>The Iranian army shot down an unidentified drone near the port of Bandar-e Mahshahr on the Gulf coast on Friday, Iran’s semi-official <i>ISNA</i> news agency reported.</p>
      <p>The unmanned aircraft was downed over Iranian territory with a domestically manufactured Mersad surface-to-air missile, said <i>Tasnim</i> news agency which is close to the ultra-conservatives.</p>
      <p>Neither news agency gave any further details of the incident which comes amid soaring tensions between Tehran and Washington since President Donald Trump unilaterally abandoned a landmark 2015 nuclear deal last year and reimposed crippling sanctions.</p>
      <p>Trump in June authorised a military strike after Iran shot down a US drone, only to call off the retaliation at the last moment.</p>
      <p>Washington insists the aircraft was in international airspace, but Iran says it was over its territorial waters.</p>
      <p>The crisis deepened with the September 14 attacks on Saudi energy giant Aramco’s Abqaiq processing plant and Khurais oilfield which halved the kingdom’s crude output.</p>
      <p>Yemen’s Iran-backed Huthi rebels claimed responsibility, but the US says the attacks involved cruise missiles from Iran and amounted to “an act of war”.</p>
      <p>Washington has responded with a military build-up in the Gulf and on Thursday launched an operation with its allies to protect navigation in Gulf waters.</p>
      <p>Since May the United States has increased its 70,000-strong presence in the Middle East by 14,000 personnel, according to Pentagon figures, most of them deployed to the Gulf region.</p>
