      <p>(Reuters) - Gap Inc (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/GPS.N">GPS.N</a>) said on Thursday Chief Executive Officer Art Peck will leave the company, a surprise exit in the middle of a restructuring that comes as the apparel retailer slashed its full-year earnings forecast, sending its shares down 7%.</p>

      <p>Since taking the helm in 2015, Peck has tried to re-energize sales at the Gap brand, once a trend setter with its casual logo emblazoned hoodies and Khaki cargos, but it has recently struggled to keep pace with fast-fashion rivals such as Zara and H&amp;M.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, the company estimated a 4% drop in third-quarter same-store sales, with declines across all its key brands including Old Navy.</p>
      <p>The drop comes as the Gap brand also has heavily discounted in a competitive retail environment.</p>
      <p>“Gap’s whole portfolio is having a brand erosion crisis that we expect to only deepen with the current leadership vacuum,” said Camilla Yanushevsky, research analyst at CFRA.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Gap said it will separate its better-performing Old Navy brand and shutter about 230 stores of its namesake apparel business, a process likely to be completed by 2020.</p>
      <p>Peck, who was to head the new Gap Inc, is credited with developing the company’s “omni-channel” strategy that uses its retail stores and its digital platform to fulfill orders.</p>
      <p>“Peck deserves a lot of credit for decisive corrective action and starting to rationalize the retail store base and deserves credit for streamlining the supply chain in a challenging international environment,” said Burt Flickinger, managing director of Strategic Resource Group.</p>
      <p>“Where he missed was their marketing and merchandising and pricing and promotional program.”</p>
      <p>Robert Fisher, a member of the founding family behind Gap and its non-executive board chairman, will become the chief executive officer on an interim basis, effective immediately, the company said.</p>
      <p>But the company’s dismal forecasts indicated that Peck’s efforts are yet to yield results.</p>
      <p>Gap also now expects full-year adjusted earnings per share of $1.70 to $1.75, down from its previous forecast of $2.05 to $2.15.</p>
      <p>The quarter was “challenging”, Chief Financial Officer Teri List-Stoll said, adding macro impact and slower traffic deepened the hit from product and operating challenges across key brands.</p>
      <p>“(The) results also reiterate our skepticism that the spin-off of touted stronghold Old Navy can unlock value,” analyst Yanushevsky said.</p>
      <p>Shares of the company were down 7.4% at $16.71 in extended trading. The stock has lost nearly a third of its value this year.</p>
