      <h1>Royal Mint releases coin for Remembrance Day 2019</h1>
      <h2>It marks 100 years of remembrance</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T13:46:19+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 13:46</time> by <a rel="author">Neil Shaw, Jamie Hawkins</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://fave.co/32vrqls">Royal Mint</a> has released a new coin for this year's Remembrance Sunday.</p>
      <p>This year marks 100 years since the first Remembrance Day which was held in the grounds of Buckingham Palace by George V on November 11, 2019, a year after the guns had fallen silent.</p>
      <p>World War One officially ended with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles on June 28, 1919.</p>
      <p>Many countries changed the name of Armistice Day to Remembrance Day during World War Two, while the US changed the name to Veteran's Day.</p>

      <p>A spokesman for the Royal Mint said: "The coin commemorates 100 years since the first formal Remembrance service and features a red Flanders poppy and the iconic phrase from the fourth stanza of Laurence Binyon's poem 'For the Fallen'."</p>
      <p>The £5 coin is now on sale from the <a href="https://fave.co/32vrqls">Royal Mint</a>.</p>
      <p>The fourth stanza of the poem reads: "They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old: Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn. At the going down of the sun and in the morning We will remember them."</p>
