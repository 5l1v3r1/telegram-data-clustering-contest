      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T13:38:50+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 13:38</time> by <a rel="author">David McDonnell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-mcdonnell/</a></address>
      <p>Ederson is out of Manchester CIty's title showdown at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool </a>on Sunday.</p>
      <p>City's first-choice goalkeeper suffered a thigh muscle strain in the 1-1 Champions League draw away to Atalanta in midweek.</p>
      <p>Pep Guardiola had hoped Ederson would recover in time to play at Anfield, but the City boss confirmed today that he is out.</p>
      <p>It means Claudio Bravo, who was sent off in Italy after coming on as a substitute, will play in goal for City in a game they cannot afford to lose if they are to stay in touch with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> in the title race.</p>

      <p>Guardiola said: “He [Ederson] is not able to play. [But] We have another top keeper - Claudio Bravo can do it too.</p>
      <p>"We won the Carabao Cup thanks to Claudio. He's an exceptional keeper, he played a lot of games for Chile."</p>

      <p>Bravo's last Premier League start for CIty was 18 months ago at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> on the final day of the 2017-18 season, when City had already won the title.</p>
      <p>Asked whether he was confident in the Chilean, Guardiola declared: "Why shouldn’t I be confident in my players? I would not like to be a player if my manager doubts me.</p>
      <p>"I see him every day in training and how good a goalkeeper he is, we’re not going to lose because of Claudio.</p>
      <p>"The red card at Atalanta is because we lost the ball in a dangerous position. He won the Copa America, respect that guy, he’s an incredible goalkeeper.”</p>
      <p>Guardiola also said he hopes there is no repeat of the attack on the City team coach, which saw Liverpool fans pelt the vehicle with missiles before a Champions League quarter-final tie in April 2018.</p>
      <p>The City boss said: “Hopefully it will be an incredible game and hopefully not the same is going to happen like two seasons ago, when it was more than one bottle [thrown]."</p>
