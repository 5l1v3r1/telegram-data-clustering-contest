      <h1>Rodent paw prints and gnaw marks among reasons for closure of 14 food outlets last month</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T13:50:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 13:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>Fourteen food outlets were ordered to close last month due to issues including dead rats in a dry goods storeroom, rodent paw marks on dusty shelves and gnaw marks on coffee bean bags.</p>
      <p>They include a restaurant and a takeaway in Dublin, a takeaway in Roscommon, another in Cork and a restaurant in Meath.</p>
      <p>The Authority also issued 17 enforcement orders, which is the highest in a month so far this year. FSAI chief Dr Pamela Byrne described it as "an unacceptable number".</p>
      <p>She added: "It is imperative that a proper pest control system is in place and that this is checked very regularly in order to avoid infestations of rodents and insects.</p>
      <p>"With the busy Christmas period nearly upon us, food businesses must be especially vigilant to ensure compliance with the law and to protect the health of their customers.</p>
      <p>"Special attention should be given to food safety training for both full and part-time staff to cope with any extra demand."</p>
