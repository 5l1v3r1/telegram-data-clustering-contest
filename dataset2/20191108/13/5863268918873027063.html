      <p>ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – Defence Minister Pervaiz Khattak on Friday said that ordinances had been passed as per the constitution and law of the country and constitution allows us to pass the ordinances and we follow the law.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the floor of the House, while hinting towards the opposition, he said, “you were rejected by the people of Pakistan due to your policies, people would have been standing with you if you had worked for the people of the country”.</p>
      <p>The defence minister said Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf government always advocated for rule of law and strengthening of democracy. He alleged that two political parties had pushed the country into dark by taking unprecedented loans.</p>
      <p>Khattak challenged the leadership of JUI-F for fresh election in Ali Amin Gandapur s constituency and alleged that two political parties have put economy of the country in crisis.</p>
      <p>He once again invited the Jamiat Ulema-e Islam (F) leadership for dialogue to solve the issues in an amicable manner, adding that if you want democracy to flourish in the country, then come on the negotiation table for solving the issues rather than Dharna politics.</p>
      <p>About the formation of the team for the negotiation with the JUI-F leadership, the minister said he had been appointed head of the committee and authorized to nominate its members.</p>
      <p>“I nominated Speaker National Assembly, Chairman Senate and Speaker Punjab Assembly for facilitation as they are enjoying good relations with the JUI-F leadership” he added.</p>
      <p>He apprised the National Assembly that top leadership had been included in the committee to give a message that the government was serious to engage the JUI-F for resolution of issues.</p>
      <p>“We included top leadership, so JUI-F should have trust that the government was serious for dialogue” he added.</p>
