      <p>The historical connection between sports and the military is being recognized and honoured at stops across the country.</p>
      <p>In Saskatchewan, that means recognition for nearly one-third of the inductees in the Saskatchewan Sports Hall of Fame. Of the 527 honoured at the Saskatchewan Hall, around 175 have served in the Canadian military, according to curator Bryann Seib.</p>

      <p>Play Hard, Fight Hard: Sport and the Canadian Military, is a travelling exhibit created in partnership between the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame and the Military Museum in Calgary. The exhibit showcases the connection between sports and military service, recognizing athletes who also served.</p>
      <p>Reporter Alexa Lawlor highlights four Saskatchewan natives featured in the exhibit …</p>
      <p>
        <b>Ed Staniowski</b>
      </p>
      <p>Many of the things that drove Ed Staniowski in his hockey career were what pushed him during nearly three decades in the military.</p>
      <p>“That camaraderie, that teamwork, that focus and dedication that I enjoyed so much in the game of hockey, I also got a chance to experience that after hockey with the military,” said the 63-year-old native of Moose Jaw, who reached the rank of lieutenant colonel and was deployed multiple times.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Staniowski, a star in the Western Hockey League and a 10-year veteran in the National Hockey League, enlisted at the age of 29. He was, he recalled with a laugh, “one of the oldest recruits, if not the oldest recruit, in the Forces at the time.”</p>
      <p>The late start in the military is a far cry from his early start in hockey, which he credits to his big sibling.</p>
      <p>“I had an older brother who played hockey in the outdoor rinks out in Moose Jaw, and his responsibility was to look after me, so he took me down to the rink and we’d go out and play for hours,” Staniowski said.</p>
      <p>He couldn’t keep up skating with the older kids, though, so they told him to just stand between the goalposts.</p>
      <p>“And as I stood in the net with my older peers, every once in a while a puck would hit me and they would give me credit for that. ‘Nice save,’” he said.</p>
      <p>“And it’s a pretty good feeling for a kid that’s seven years old, so it kind of went from there.”</p>

      </figure>
      <p>A decade or so later, Staniowski remembers, he came home from school one day to find the coach and the general manager of the Regina Pats sitting at his family’s kitchen table, asking if he wanted to try out for the team. Staniowski played four seasons with the Pats, winning the Memorial Cup in 1974 and being named the Canadian Hockey League’s player of the year the following season. The goaltender was picked in the second round of the NHL draft, 27th overall, by the St. Louis Blues in 1975. Throughout his 10-year NHL career, Staniowski also played with the Winnipeg Jets and Hartford Whalers before retiring following the 1984-85 season.</p>
      <p>“I realized very early in my life that I loved the game of hockey,” he said. “Everything about it.”</p>

        <b>“Hick” Abbott</b>
      </p>
      <p>Edward Lyman “Hick” Abbott was known locally as one of Regina’s top young athletes. He is remembered globally for his sacrifice in the First World War.</p>
      <p>In his high school days at Central Collegiate, Abbott excelled in hockey, lacrosse, football, baseball, basketball and rugby. His skills were so highly regarded, in fact, that Abbott was considered one of Western Canada’s top all-around competitors.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>In hockey, he was a right winger who helped Regina teams win the provincial amateur championship title, and the Van Valkenburg Cup in 1911 and 1912. In 1914, Abbott’s squad won the Allan Cup and the national amateur championship with the Regina Victorias.</p>
      <p>The Regina Rugby Football Club — better known today as the Saskatchewan Roughriders — was founded in 1910. Abbott helped the team win the Western Canadian title in 1913, 1914 and 1915. At the time, that was as far as the club could go since western teams weren’t able to compete for the Grey Cup until 1921.</p>
      <p>Abbott also studied law but, in 1915 at the age of 24, instead enlisted and and qualified for the rank of lieutenant. After arriving in England, Abbott transferred to a trench unit — the 52nd Canadian Infantry Battalion.</p>
      <p>During the First World War, Abbott was wounded twice: first, in the fall of 1916 during the Battle of the Somme, and then in the fall of 1917. According to his military records, Abbott had a “severe gunshot wound near (his) right eye.” It remains unclear whether the wound was caused by a bullet or a piece of shrapnel.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Both times, Abbott survived and headed back to the front. On Aug. 8, 1918, Abbott was killed in action during the Battle of Amiens — one of the final battles of the war — mere months before the Armistice.</p>
      <p>He was honoured with the Military Cross and a 1914-1918 military medal. He is buried at the Roye New British Cemetery in France.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Claude Petit</b>
      </p>
      <p>For most athletes and veterans, their time competing and serving came separately. Claude Petit combined the two.</p>
      <p>The native of Duck Lake joined the army at the age of 17, taking a train with his 16-year-old cousin to Regina.</p>
      <p>“I just skipped school, me and my cousin,” he said. “I was pretty big for my age and I got in.”</p>

      <p>Petit served as a member of the Princess Patricia Canadian Light Infantry. Years later, he was among those pushing for what would become the National Aboriginal Veterans Monument in Ottawa, which honours the contributions of Indigenous veterans.</p>
      <p>During his years in the military, Petit was a five-time Canadian Army heavyweight champion from 1958 to 1963. In 1964, he became the only Canadian to win the British Army heavyweight boxing championship.</p>
      <p>He says his love of boxing was sparked by his family. He followed a path, both in sport and the military, set by his uncles.</p>
      <p>“My uncles were boxers in the Second World War, and when they came back, they bought us some gloves and showed us how to box,” he said.</p>
      <p>As an amateur boxer, Petit was a five-time winner of the Edmonton Golden Gloves, and also claimed Golden Gloves in Vancouver and Billings, Montana.</p>

      <p>After retiring from the military, Petit became a Level 5 boxing coach, instructing courses across the province. He later became president of the Saskatchewan Boxing Association, a founder of the Western Canadian Native Minor Hockey Championships, and was one of the driving forces behind the creation of Back to Batoche Days.</p>
      <p>Petit was named Saskatoon’s Citizen of the Year in 1994, received the Order of Canada in 1998 and the Saskatchewan Order of Merit in 2002. He was also inducted into the Canadian Boxing Hall of Fame in 1991.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Alex Decoteau</b>
      </p>
      <p>Alex Decoteau represented Canada in the Olympics and died fighting for his country years later.</p>
      <p>Decoteau was one of the top distance runners in the world, beating Boston Marathon record-setter Tom Longboat when they raced in Fort Saskatchewan in 1911. The following year, Decoteau won the 5,000-metre event at the Canadian Olympic trials and placed sixth at the 1912 Olympic Games in Stockholm, Sweden.</p>
      <p>He did all of that while serving as a highly-respected police officer.</p>

        <figcaption>Alex Decoteau (Photo courtesy Saskatchewan Sports Hall of Fame)<cite>Photo courtesy Saskatchewan Sports Hall of Fame</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Decoteau was born in 1887 on the Red Pheasant First Nation near North Battleford. His father, Pierre, was a Cree warrior who fought with Poundmaker at the Battle of Fish Creek. In 1891, his father was murdered. The man who investigated the crime, David Latta, married Decoteau’s sister, relocating to Edmonton.</p>
      <p>In 1909, Decoteau followed them and became the first Indigenous police officer in Canada when he joined the city’s police force. Soon, he became one of the first motorcycle policemen in the country. In 1914, Decoteau was promoted to sergeant, and was in charge of the West End Edmonton Police Office.</p>
      <p>Soon after relocating to Edmonton, Decoteau began to gain attention for running. In the summer of 1909 in Lloydminster, Decoteau ran his second competitive race — and set the Western Canadian record in the five-mile run.</p>
      <p>Though he established his Olympic pedigree and world-class stature, at the outbreak of the First World War, Decoteau enlisted with the Canadian Expeditionary Force. Decoteau originally served with the 202nd Infantry Battalion, and later transferred to the 49th.</p>
      <p>In late 1917, Decoteau was killed by a sniper’s bullet during the Battle of Passchendaele.</p>
