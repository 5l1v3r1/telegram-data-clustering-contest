      <h1>Mandryk: Sask. NDP still doesn't seem to know where it is going</h1>
      <h2>If governments get old, tired and lost, so do parties wandering the wilderness of opposition. Today's NDP may have forgotten how to win.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T13:00:08+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/mmandryk" target="_blank">Murray Mandryk</a></address>
      <p>A year out from the next provincial vote, the Saskatchewan New Democrats often seem as lost as they were when they emerged from the calamity that was their 2016 election campaign.</p>
      <p>This is not a positive sign for them.</p>
      <p>The upside is that — by the laws of averages — a larger NDP contingent in the Saskatchewan Legislature a year from now would seem probable. This might even be welcomed by the general electorate, that hasn’t had an effective opposition for some time.</p>
      <p>Notwithstanding the bravado we heard from veteran Saskatchewan Party MLA Don Morgan this week, the odds are the NDP will likely pick up a few extra city seats — especially given that an <a href="https://leaderpost.com/opinion/columnists/mandryk-govt-handling-of-waters-lead-contamination-sign-of-aging">aging Sask. Party government has made enough mistakes</a> to afford the NDP some gains. Perhaps it will even win enough seats (20 seems the number floated out there) to stave off a challenge to Ryan Meili’s leadership.</p>
      <p>That said, if governments get old, tired and lost, so do parties wandering the wilderness of opposition. Today’s NDP may have forgotten how to win. There is a high probability Meili will remain the NDP’s third consecutive leader who will not become Saskatchewan premier. This was once Saskatchewan’s natural governing party.</p>
      <p>Admittedly, there have been some signs of hope for the NDP of late.</p>
      <p>There seems to be a deliberate strategy to get Meili away from the legislature this fall sitting — arguably a better approach than last session, when he gobbled up the lion’s share of question period time to no avail.</p>
      <p>Some of it may even be helping expose real problems, like this week’s concerns over<a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/ndp-releases-health-authority-emails-detailing-capacity-crisis-in-saskatoon-hospitals/wcm/28194086-6925-4f85-bf7b-46892e50844b"> overcapacity at Saskatoon hospitals.</a></p>
      <p>Similarly, proposing practical solutions — like Wednesday’s call to <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/saskatchewan/we-will-take-what-we-can-get-moe-says-on-prospective-carbon-tax-talks/wcm/39e6b801-aaf9-49fa-9dcb-8c1316cb2faf?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1573089310">remove the carbon tax from natural gas used for grain drying</a> — is especially important for Meili, because it speaks to real rural concerns where Meili and the NDP happen to be weakest. This may even have shone some light on the problem with Premier Scott Moe’s dysfunctional relationship with the federal Liberal government, where his adamant opposition to the carbon tax and everything Justin Trudeau makes finding reasoned solutions to problems a near-impossibility.</p>
      <p>But Moe and the Sask. Party are surely not losing sleep over Meili and the NDP making inroads in rural Saskatchewan … or even winning any rural seats in a year. If anything, Moe and the Sask. Party welcome anything that fits into their own narrative that Meili is “weak” and <a href="https://twitter.com/SaskParty/status/1190034918287511553?s=20">far too similar to/aligned with federal leader NDP Jagmeet Singh and Trudeau.</a></p>
      <p>This might seem unfair, but make no mistake, Meiil and the NDP are struggling to connect.</p>
      <p>Far too often, the NDP has forgotten that opposition issues often begin with a “B” — as in the billions spent on the bypass/Global Transportation Hub, a billion-dollar PST hike or the borrowing of a billion dollars from 2015 to 2017 to build projects which created deficits and a growing debt.</p>
      <p>Occasionally, the NDP has been able to connect the notion that big government spending robs government of its capacity to deal with issues like <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/saskatchewan/class-sizes-average-25-at-regina-and-saskatoon-elementary-schools">classroom overcrowding</a> or <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/saskatchewan/suicide-prevention-bill-back-before-legislature-but-minister-prefers-review">money for mental health to prevent suicides. </a></p>
      <p>But there have clearly been more misses than hits from an NDP opposition that too often seems to be talking to its own supporters or getting far too caught up in legislature games. Consider last Tuesday, when the NDP raised the non-partisan issue of a suicide strategy, yet was somehow intent on making it all about the premier not getting to his feet (he eventually did) to specifically speak to the issue in question period. As one Sask. Party insider noted, the NDP seemed to be “trying to make it a bigger issue than the issue they’re trying to focus on.”</p>
      <p>Frankly, even those within the NDP are raising questions about this party being lost, as seemed evident in last week’s annual convention <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/saskatchewan/sask-ndp-gripped-by-fierce-debate-over-union-donations?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Twitter#">debate over accepting donations from unions.</a></p>
      <p>This is a party that desperately needs to figure out where it must go to be successful.</p>
