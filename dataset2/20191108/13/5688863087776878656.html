      <p>The Eden Gardens will witness India’s maiden day-night Test as the hosts will take to the field against Bangladesh on November 22. Keeping the historic event in mind, Cricket Association of Bengal has left no stone unturned to make it a memorable affair.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina will be ringing the customary bell at the Eden Gardens which will mark the start of the match. The bell will be rung at 12:55 PM, five minutes before the start of play.</p>
      <p>“Sheikh Hasina has confirmed,” CAB joint secretary Debabrata Das told Sportstar.</p>
      <p>The CAB hasn’t yet decided upon who will be ringing the bell on the rest of the four days of the historic match but they do have a plethora of choices ahead of them.</p>
      <p>“It is difficult to say that now. It depends. But we will have a host of dignitaries present. It could be anybody,” Das added.</p>
      <p>While the stalwarts of India cricket, <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/sachin_tendulkar">Sachin Tendulkar</a>, <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/rahul_dravid">Rahul Dravid</a> and <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/vvs_laxman">VVS Laxman</a> will be gracing the occasion, Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) CEO Nizamuddin Chowdhury and president Nazmul Hassan Papon are also expected to be in attendance.</p>
      <p>According to a Sportstar report, chess Grandmasters Vishwanathan Anand and Magnus Carlsen are on the CAB’s wish list for the bell ceremony in one of the days of the match. The chess maestros will be in Kolkata for the Tata Steel Rapid and Blitz chess tournament at the same time.</p>
