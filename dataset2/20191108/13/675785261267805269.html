      <p>Tommy Fury has appeared to confirm he will return to the ring next month.</p>
      <p>Love Island star Fury is yet to fight since finishing as runner-up in the ITV show this summer with girlfriend Molly-Mae Hague.</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old took to social media to seemingly announce the bout, with a video captioned: "Are you ready 21.12.19."</p>
      <p>Fury added a bomb emoji to the post and also targeted promoter Frank Warren.</p>
      <p>Fury has had two professional fights, winning both against Jevgenijs Andrejevs and Callum Ide.</p>

      <p>His Love Island co-stars were quick to share their support with Ovie Soko and Chris Taylor commenting on the post.</p>
      <p>Fury's partner Molly-Mae may not be as excited though and expressed her concern over his return to the ring recently.</p>
      <p>The couple had been ringside for Tommy's brother Tyson's victory over Otto Wallin.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/molly-mae-hague-explains-shes-20330884">During an exclusive chat with Mirror Online</a> , the reality beauty said: "The holiday was amazing. It was the first fight I'd ever seen but it was intense, more intense than I thought.</p>

      <p>"I'm not looking forward to watching Tommy, I felt really scared when it was Tyson.</p>
      <p>"I got to know him really well before the fight, we went to his house to hang out and it's not nice to see anyone you know getting beat up, even if it is their job.</p>
      <p>"Obviously Tommy is incredible at boxing and I have every faith in him so I know when he gets back in the ring it won't be nice but it's something I'll have to deal with."</p>
      <p>Meanwile, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tyson-fury">Tyson Fury</a> is set to return to WWE this weekend as SmackDown heads for Manchester.</p>
      <p>The British heavyweight beat Braun Strowman on his debut at Crown Jewel.</p>
