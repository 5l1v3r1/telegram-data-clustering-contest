      <p><a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/Samsung">Samsung</a> has a good history of learning with its mistakes and living to see the bright of the sun in next day. It happened with the Galaxy Note 7, and now it’s happening with the Galaxy Fold. We can’t compare the two problems, we know, but the essence is almost the same. After a design flaw was discovered in the Galaxy Fold, Samsung was forced to push its launch several months ahead. Now, the handset is finally available in some select markets. The latest market to receive the foldable smartphone was the stronghold of China.</p>

      <p>According to Samsung’s official <a href="https://www.weibo.com/2031482343/Ifeertwpk">Weibo</a> account, all units of the CNY15,999-priced phone (over $2,000) sold out in five minutes. Unfortunately, Samsung didn’t disclose how many devices have been sold during the debut sales. We can’t say much without the official numbers. If there were only 1,000 units available, then, selling all of them in five minutes wouldn’t be so impressive. Especially for the Chinese market. Nevertheless, some people actually paid the equivalent of $2,288/€2,000 to get the Huawei Mate X’s major rival.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, Samsung opted for selling the variant which lacks 5G connectivity. That’s a major drawback for potential customers that are also willing to jump in the next-gen network. The South-Korean firm is yet to announce when the next batch of Galaxy Fold will be available for purchase.</p>
