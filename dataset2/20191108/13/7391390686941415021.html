      <p>Winter is commonly associated with feeling run down, leading to ailments like colds, sore throats, and general tiredness. But when you're experiencing, say, a really persistent throat problem but struggling to secure a GP appointment, you may end up taking time off work to recover. Now though, <a href="https://www.superdrug.com/services/throat-swab-test">thanks to Superdrug, sore throats can be treated</a> in a matter of minutes.</p>
      <p>The company is now offering a test and treat service across 200 stores nationwide. It simply involves <a href="https://www.superdrug.com/services/throat-swab-test">rocking up to a Superdrug pharmacy</a> and asking for a free 10-minute consultation. A pharmacist will determine your symptoms and examine your throat for tell-tale signs of an infection.</p>
      <p>If necessary, they may also administer a five-minute swab test to see whether your issue is viral or bacterial. If the swab identifies a viral cause, antibiotics won't help. (But you'll be in the best place to pick up other treatment such as a throat spray.) But if your sore throat has a bacterial cause, you may be prescribed antibiotics, for the usual £9 prescription fee, or referred to your GP.</p>
      <p>Note that swabs cannot identify all bacterial strains. And if your symptoms get worse or don't improve after three days, you will be advised to see your GP anyway.</p>

      <p>Superdrug <a href="https://www.chemistanddruggist.co.uk/news/superdrug-launches-free-sore-throat-service-over-200-branches">launched a similar service in 2018</a>, per Chemist+Druggist, but was unable to prescribe antibiotics, instead referring patients to GPs. Its ability to treat sore throats could take some pressure off the NHS.</p>
      <p>According to Superdrug, more than a million people visit doctors' surgeries <a href="https://www.superdrug.com/services/throat-swab-test">with sore throat complaints</a> each year. And, as <i>Cosmopolitan </i>notes, GPs <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/body/health/a29721893/sore-throat-viral-bacterial-test-tonsillitis-superdrug/">spend an estimated 200,000 hours annually</a> dealing with sore throats with only around 10% of cases being treatable by antibiotics.</p>
      <p>Pharmacy services such as this are expected to increase in the next few years. Lloyds Pharmacy <a href="https://www.chemistanddruggist.co.uk/news/lloydspharmacy-sore-throat-service-enquiries">used to offer</a> a £4.99 sore throat service, but <a href="http://www.lloydspharmacy.com/en/info/sore-throat-test-and-treat">no longer does</a>. However, Boots is hoping to work with the NHS to <a href="https://www.chemistanddruggist.co.uk/news/boots-wants-sore-throat-service-national">introduce sore throat testing services across England</a>, reports Chemist+Druggist.</p>
      <p>Boots' trial was criticised by one GP. Writing for the <i>Guardian</i>, Margaret McCartney pointed out that the antigen test used "<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/15/sore-throats-pharmacies-nhs">has a poor sensitivity</a> for picking up relevant bugs" and is not recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).</p>
      <p>She also questioned the level of antibiotic prescriptions for sore throats, stating they only "reduce the length of time of a sore throat by an average of 16 hours. Balanced against common side effects of antibiotics such as diarrhoea, as well as antibiotic resistance, there is often not a clear-cut reason to prescribe."</p>
      <p>Still, with the average Brit <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/health/733728/sore-throats-not-caused-by-illness">getting a sore throat twice every winter</a>, per the <i>Express</i>, a lot of people are likely to support Superdrug's new service.</p>
