      <h1>Breaking: Another PSL Club Parts Ways With Head Coach</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T13:17:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 13:17</time> by <a rel="author">Soccer Laduma</a></address>
      <p>It has been confirmed to the Siya crew that Polokwane City have parted ways with their head coach.</p>
      <p>As reported on Soccer Laduma yesterday, Zlatko Krmpotic’s immediate future at Rise and Shine has been under much speculation, with sources indicating that the head coach was on thin ice due to the team’s poor run of form in the Absa Premiership.</p>
      <p>It has since been confirmed to the Siya crew by an insider that the club and the Serbian head coach have agreed to part ways amicably. </p>
      <p>A statement sent to Soccer Laduma by a source close to the coach read; </p>
      <p>
        <i>It is with regret that we announce the departure of Zlatko Krmpotic as the Head Coach of Polokwane City Football Club.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Despite the best efforts of the Club, the Head Coach and all Parties involved with the Club, recent results on the field of play, have, unfortunately, not gone in our favour. </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>This has prompted the Club and the Head Coach to reconsider the position of Zlatko as the Head Coach of the Club. </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>In the circumstances, pursuant to a meeting between the Club Chairman, Mr. Johnny Mogaladi and the Head Coach it was agreed, in the best interests of the Club, that the Club and Head Coach part ways in an amicable manner. </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Accordingly, the Parties have signed a mutual termination of their Contract of Employment with immediate effect. As of this morning, Zlatko has been relieved of his duties and is no longer the Head Coach of Polokwane City FC. </i>
