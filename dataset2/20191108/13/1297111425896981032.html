      <h1>Johnson: One-of-a-kind ’Vette pickup</h1>

      <p>Pickups are everywhere — especially in Saskatchewan. This is indeed F-150, Ram and Silverado country.</p>
      <p>But Coleton Nickol of Swift Current has a pickup that really stands out. He doesn’t have to worry about his pickup looking like all the others. His rig is one of a kind.</p>
      <p>And it’s not just that it’s older than average. It’s a 1982 model. Sure, there are a few ’82 pickups still on the road. That’s not what sets his apart from the crowd.</p>
      <p>His pickup has a diesel engine — like plenty of other trucks. Nothing special there.</p>
      <p>But its diminutive size makes people stare.</p>
      <p>His diesel pickup is the smallest one on the parking lot. At about 4188 mm, it’s 1165 mm (almost four feet) shorter than a new Chevrolet Silverado Crew Cab.</p>
      <p>And what really sets Nickol’s pickup apart is the model name.</p>
      <p>It’s a Chevrolet Chevette.</p>
      <p>The Chevette was Chevrolet’s entry-level model from 1976 to 1987. It was the smallest and cheapest Chevy — and for a time it was the best-selling small car in North America. In all, more than 2.8 million Chevettes were sold.</p>
      <p>The Chevrolet Chevette was the North American version of a small car that had been developed by GM in Germany, and sold in other countries under various names: the Opel Kadett C in Germany, the Isuzu Bellett Gemini in Japan, the Vauxhall Chevette in England and the Holden Gemini in Australia. Later, there were Pontiac versions called the Acadian and the T1000.</p>
      <p>Nickol created his Chevette pickup from a four-door hatchback Chevette.</p>
      <p>He saw an ad on Kijiji in the fall of 2017 for a 1982 Chevette diesel. It wasn’t running, and had gone 152,000 kms.</p>
      <p>“After negotiations the seller and I agreed on $425. I drove to Saskatoon with my dad’s truck, some friends, and a trailer. The car had supposedly received ‘professional’ body work and was rust-free,” Nickol recalls.</p>
      <p>It turned out that when Nickol met the seller, the car wasn’t there. The seller provided him with directions to pick it up.</p>
      <p>“In retrospect, a bit sketchy. Good thing I picked it up in the dark, because not only was it rusted, the paint was also stripped. I loaded it up and home we came,” he remembers.</p>
      <p>“We pulled it in to the shop to change the starter, and after a full inspection, my dad and I realized that mechanically there was nothing major wrong with the car.”</p>
      <p>But it was a different story with the body, which had extensive rust, especially on the posts supporting the roof at the back of the car.</p>
      <p>His father was helping with the project. His father had put more than 850,000 kms on his Duramax, a V-8 6.6 litre diesel engine used on GM trucks.</p>
      <p>“It appeared the Chevette had been rolled or jumped on. My dad suggested that we pull out the cutter and turn it into the world’s smallest Duramax pickup. He was kidding — but I wasn’t.”</p>
      <p>In the early 1980s, Chevettes popularized the idea of diesels in passenger cars, in order to get better fuel economy.</p>
      <p>GM dropped a 51-horsepower 1.8 litre diesel from Isuzu (a Japanese automaker affiliated with GM) in the Chevette to create the diesel version. It was available only with a five-speed standard transmission, and air conditioning was not available, as both automatics and air conditioning take power from engines — and this engine has no surplus power.</p>
      <p>“With a zero-to-sixty time of 21.2 seconds and a top speed of barely 80 mph, it always feels as if you’ve left the hand brake on,” Car and Driver magazine said in July 1981.</p>
      <p>But the goal of outstanding fuel economy was accomplished, with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rating the Chevette diesel at 5.9 litres per 100 kms in the city and 4.3 l/100 kms on the highway.</p>
      <p>Car and Driver also had praise for the Chevette diesel, saying, “It starts almost instantly from cold, runs smoothly, and is no noisier than a gas-engined small car on the highway.”</p>
      <p>Motor Trend magazine tested a diesel Chevette along with two other diesels, a VW Rabbit and an Isuzu I-Mark, in August 1981, and said the $7,578 Chevette, “needs more interior room and a more modern dashboard/instrument panel layout…but even at that, we think it’s the winner in this three-vehicle comparison. The price is right, the mileage is the best of the three, the ride and handling with the optional equipment are superior.”</p>
      <p>Nickol drives his Chevette pickup year-round, and the minus-30-degree weather in the winter doesn’t cause any problems.</p>
      <p>He recently drove it to Castlegar, B.C., and says he “had a great time driving as slow as semi-trucks up the long, steep grades.”</p>
      <p>He says the best part of owning a Chevette diesel pickup is the reaction it gets from other drivers.</p>
      <p>“For the most part it’s just thumbs-up and rubbernecks.”</p>
