      <p>Saskatchewan Roughriders quarterback Cody Fajardo met with the media on Thursday, ostensibly to discuss being the <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-quarterback-cody-fajardo-named-west-divisions-most-outstanding-player">West Division’s nominee for the most outstanding player award.</a></p>
      <p>The scrum, however, was dominated by questions regarding <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/riders-cody-fajardo-vows-to-be-ready-for-west-final">Fajardo’s injured oblique muscle.</a></p>
      <p>“It’s getting better each day,” Fajardo said. “The medical staff and myself have been working tirelessly to get it where it needs to be. Thankfully, we still have some more days (until the West Division final).”</p>
      <p>Fajardo missed the Riders’ 23-13 win over the Edmonton Eskimos on Saturday <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zQUJAzCey0">after injuring an oblique muscle during the week leading up to the regular-season finale for both teams.</a></p>
      <p><a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-ride-rookie-passer-isaac-harker-to-victory">Rookie backup quarterback Isaac Harker handled pivot duties in Fajardo’s absence,</a> going 23 of 28 for 213 yards, with no touchdowns or interceptions.</p>

      <p>“I have thrown a football, so there is positive news there,” Fajardo added. “It was a whiffle ball, but it was still a whiffle football. I did that today and I felt pretty good about it.”</p>
      <p>The Riders are scheduled to practise at the AffinityPlex on Friday for the first time since Saturday’s win clinched first place and a bye into the West Division final on Nov. 17. Fajardo isn’t expected to participate in the indoor practice — even though he’s improving.</p>
      <p>“Don’t panic, Rider Nation,” Fajardo said. “I probably won’t be out there. If I am, then I am. Don’t panic because things are getting better.”</p>
