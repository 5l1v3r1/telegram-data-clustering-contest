      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Arsenal">Arsenal</a> have been handed a showdown with <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/paris-saint-germain">Paris Saint-Germain</a> in the quarter-finals of the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/womens-champions-league">Women’s Champions League</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/glasgow-city">Glasgow City</a>, meanwhile, will tackle German side Wolfsburg, while holders <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Lyon">Lyon</a> face Bayern Munich and there will be an all-Spanish fixture between Atletico Madrid and Barcelona.</p>
      <p>Arsenal, winners in 2006/07, had cruised into the quarter-finals following an 8-0 win over Slavia Prague, completing a 13-2 aggregate success for Joe Montemurro’s side, with Glasgow City progressing after a penalty shoot-out against Brondby.</p>
      <p>The quarter-finals will be played on March 24/25 and April 1/2.</p>
      <p>Atletico Madrid knocked out Manchester City as the Spanish champions made it through to the last eight for the first time, while Barcelona were runners-up last season.</p>
      <p>Lyon are targeting a record seventh title and fifth in a row, with Bayern aiming to improve on their previous best of the semi-finals in 2018/19.</p>
      <p>Should Arsenal progress, they would play Lyon or Bayern, while the winners of Glasgow City against Wolfsburg will meet either Atletico Madrid or Barcelona.</p>
      <p>The semi-finals will be played on April 25/26 and May 2/3, with the final held in Viola Park, Vienna on May 24.</p>
