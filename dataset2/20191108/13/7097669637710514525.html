      <h1>More Dictator Than God: Kim Jong-Un's Cult Of Personality Is Going Strong</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T13:40:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 13:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://nationalinterest.org/" target="_blank">Doug Bandow</a></address>
      <p><b>Key point: </b>North Koreans have faced a severe level of psychological indoctrination.</p>
      <p>North Korea without doubt is unique. If nothing else, its claimed accomplishments rival the faux Russian achievements cited by Pavel Chekov in the original <i>Star Trek</i>. Yet only the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has established a Communist monarchy, now reaching the third generation.</p>
      <p>The real question for Kim Jong-un is whether he, like his father and grandfather, will follow the Ottoman practice of producing multiple children from multiple consorts. That always makes a succession fight much more interesting. Even so, royal baby sightings still are rare in the DPRK.</p>
      <p>But the North Korean regime has gone a step further in claiming that Great Leader Kim Il-sung, grandfather to Cute Leader Kim Jong-un, as I call the latter, is not only god, but recognized as such by America’s legendary evangelist Billy Graham. On Kim Il-sung’s birthday last week, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/04/15/north-korean-state-media-says-billy-graham-thought-kim-il-sung-was-god/">reported</a> Adam Taylor in the <i>Washington Post</i>, the DPRK paper <i>Rodong Sinmun</i> <a href="http://www.rodong.rep.kp/ko/index.php?strPageID=SF01_02_01&amp;newsID=2016-04-15-4003">reported</a> that Graham, who traveled several times to North Korea, praised the senior Kim’s rule.</p>
      <p>Indeed, “said” Graham: “Having observed the Supreme Leader Kim Il-sung’s unique political leadership, I can only think that he is God.” Moreover, “if God is the leader of another world, savior and ruler of the past and future life that exists in our imagination, I acknowledge the Supreme Leader Kim Il-sung is the God who rules today’s human world.” The man who raised the Bible at thousands of crusades then “said,” according to the <i>Rodong Sinmun</i>, “Kim is this world’s God. Why would a country like this need the Holy Bible?”</p>
