      <h1>Rafael Nadal racing to be fit for ATP Finals with No.1 up for grabs</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T13:46:36+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 13:46</time> by <a rel="author">AFP</a></address>
      <p>LONDON: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Rafael-Nadal">Rafael Nadal</a> is facing a race against time to be ready for the ATP Finals as he battles <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Novak-Djokovic">Novak Djokovic</a> for the year-end number one ranking, admitting he is struggling with his serve.</p>
      <p>Nadal is bidding to clinch the year-end number one spot in the ATP rankings for a fifth time -- he is currently 640 points ahead of Djokovic ahead of the season-ending tournament in London.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard pulled out of last week's <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Paris-Masters">Paris Masters</a> at the semi-final stage and is nursing an abdominal strain as he gears up for his first match on Monday.</p>

      <p>Nadal, who has never won the ATP Finals despite his trophy-laden career, dethroned Djokovic from the top of the rankings this week.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old said he was happy to be in London after being forced to pull out of Paris but admitted he was not serving at full tilt.</p>
      <p>"I need to see how things evolve every single day," he said. "I have good hopes to be 100 percent ready for Monday."</p>
      <p>The Spanish top seed said he had only started practising his serving on Thursday and it had been "very slow".</p>
      <p>"For me the main goal is to be healthy for Monday more than to have a huge amount of services," he added.</p>
      <p>Nadal, who won the French Open and US Open this year, said he had been happy with his form before his injury.</p>
      <p>"I'm confident that I can be very competitive but of course it's a tournament that you will face the top guys from the beginning so you need to be 100 percent ready.</p>
      <p>"I really hope that I will be able to serve every single day better."</p>
      <p>Nadal's opponents in the Andre Agassi group are <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Daniil-Medvedev">Daniil Medvedev</a>, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Stefanos-Tsitsipas">Stefanos Tsitsipas</a> and Alexander Zverev.</p>
      <p>His first match is on Monday against defending champion Zverev.</p>
      <p>The Bjorn Bjorg group features Djokovic, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Roger-Federer">Roger Federer</a>, Dominic Thiem and Matteo Berrettini.</p>
      <p>The season-ending event, featuring the year's best eight players, is contested in a round-robin format with the best four players and doubles teams reaching the knockout semi-finals stage.</p>
