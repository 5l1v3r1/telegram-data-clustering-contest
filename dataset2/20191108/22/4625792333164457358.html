      <h1>Nikki Haley: 'I don't feel comfortable' with Trump asking Ukraine for 'favor'</h1>

      <p>Nikki Haley admitted that she wasn't "comfortable" with President Trump asking Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden but said the House does not have any basis for impeaching him because there was no quid pro quo.</p>
      <p>In a preview clip for the CBS Sunday interview, the former ambassador to the United Nations said, "I don't feel comfortable" with Trump asking the president of Ukraine for a "favor" during their infamous July 25 phone call.</p>
      <p>"I don't think it's good for us to ever want a foreign country to investigate an American," she said. "That's just not something we want to get into the practice of doing."</p>
      <p>However, she still dismissed the impeachment proceedings, saying, "I also don't feel comfortable with the fact that we're having an impeachment process during an election year."</p>

      <p>"On what? You're going to impeach a president for asking for a favor that didn’t happen and — and giving money, and it wasn’t withheld?" the South Carolina Republican continued railing against impeachment in an excerpt set to air on CBS News Friday evening.</p>

      <p>Haley <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidMDrucker/status/1192920539997855744">added</a>, "And look, Norah, impeachment is, like, the death penalty for a public official. When you look at the transcript, there’s nothing in that transcript that warrants the death penalty for the president."</p>
      <p>House Democrats are impeaching Trump on the accusation that he threatened to withhold military aid to Ukraine if they did not investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. The impeachment process started after a whistleblower, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/vindman-and-whistleblower-still-work-together-on-u-s-policy-towards-ukraine">allegedly Eric Ciaramella</a> filed a report based on the call between Trump and Ukraine's president.</p>
      <p>Nikki Haley is releasing her <a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-Due-Respect-Defending-America/dp/1250266556">new book</a> <i>With All Due Respect: Defending America with Grit and Grace </i>next week. The former governor of South Carolina <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/communication-was-nearly-constant-nikki-haley-opens-up-about-working-with-trump">touts her relationship with Trump</a> in the book, saying he gave her the power to "chart her own course" in the administration.</p>
      <p>Haley <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/read-nikki-haleys-letter-of-resignation">sent in her resignation</a> from her position a year ago, saying she has "long believed that rotation in office benefits the public." It was reported two months ago that she moved back to South Carolina, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/nikki-haley-fuels-political-speculation-with-move-back-to-south-carolina">creating speculation</a> she could be returning to politics.</p>
