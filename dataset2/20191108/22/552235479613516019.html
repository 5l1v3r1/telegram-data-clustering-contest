      <h1>Neil Lennon explains the Celtic spirit that has him reminiscing of Seville</h1>
      <h2>The Hoops boss isn't looking past the last 32 but admits his players have every right to dream.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T22:30:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Gary Ralston, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/gary-ralston/</a></address>
      <p>Neil Lennon reckons he can smell the spirit of Seville as he reflected on one of his greatest nights as a Celt.</p>
      <p>The Hoops boss refuses to contemplate a run all the way to the Europa League final at this stage, but doesn’t mind his players dreaming of Gdansk. And the prospect of a meeting in the round of 16 against <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> was summed up in one word: “Carnage!”</p>
      <p>Lennon was basking in the aftermath of his side’s 2-1 win over Lazio as they qualified for the last 32 and became the first Celtic side to win in Italy.</p>
      <p>He reckoned there were shades of 2003 in their display at the Olympic Stadium, when <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Lennon</a> was the midfield lynchpin in a Martin O’Neill side that defied the odds time and again to reach the final.</p>
      <p>Lennon said: “It’s the first time I’ve really felt, since I’ve been back, it’s <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> again. That sort of big night, with a huge crowd and connection with the fans – the whole lot.</p>

      <p>“It was just like the old days, absolutely fantastic. Even when we went a goal down and were a little bit on the ropes, the atmosphere in the away end was unbelievable.</p>
      <p>“Then the scenes at the end were just fabulous, it took me back 15 or 20 years ago – that rawness of the support and connection with players. It was special.</p>
      <p>“In 2003 they were coming in their thousands when we filled venues such as Ewood Park and Anfield.</p>
      <p>“I’m sure we could have sold even more tickets for the game in Rome. It gives the fans a real feel for it again, that gravitas in Europe against a top side.</p>
      <p>“Then for us to go and play as brilliantly as that, it just all felt like it was coming together again.”</p>
      <p>Matchwinner <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/olivier-ntcham">Olivier Ntcham</a> became the latest Celtic player to state they can go all the way in the competition but Lennon was emphatic when asked if he allows himself to dream.</p>
      <p>He added: “No. We are in the last 32. I love to hear players talking like that, it’s a huge positive, but the last 32 doesn’t come around until February and that’s three months away.</p>

      <p>“A lot of things can come and go before then – form, whatever – and then you’ve got the January window.</p>
      <p>“We’ll take it one step at a time. I’m looking forward to the two remaining group games when we can be a bit more relaxed and maybe utilise some of the squad.</p>
      <p>“Then we’ll look forward to the draw. Hopefully we can top the group and that will give us a better chance.</p>
      <p>“I’m just delighted we’re through, especially doing it with belief and purpose.”</p>
      <p>Rangers are also within touching distance of the knockout stage after their 2-0 win over Porto and the collective efforts of the Old Firm in Europe boosted the national co-efficient.</p>
      <p>Lennon has put on a united front of praise for the Scottish game, but he laughed when asked his thoughts on an Old Firm European showdown, although clubs from the same nation can’t face each other until the last 16.</p>
      <p>He said: “It would be carnage! We’d have to play a one-off game somewhere, behind closed doors.</p>
      <p>“Both clubs are serving Scotland very well at the minute.”</p>
      <p>Lenny is also keen his side don’t lose focus at home to Motherwell and added: “We’ve got to get the players down because we it’s an important game.”</p>
