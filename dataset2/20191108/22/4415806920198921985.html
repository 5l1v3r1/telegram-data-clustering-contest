      <p>A French woman in her early 60s claims she was raped as a teenager by Oscar-winning filmmaker Roman Polanski, according to reports in the French media.</p>
      <p>The director has been a fugitive from the US for more than four decades since pleading guilty to a sex offence.</p>
      <p>Le Parisien reported that the woman alleges she was raped in 1975 at Polanski’s chalet in Gstaad, Switzerland, when she was 18.</p>
      <p>It quotes Polanski’s lawyer, Herve Temime, as saying that Polanski “firmly contests” the allegation.</p>
      <p>The attorney “deplored” that the claim is being made public shortly before Polanski’s latest film, J’Accuse, is being released in France.</p>
      <p>Le Parisien quotes the woman as saying the film triggered her decision to go public.</p>
      <p>Polanski pleaded guilty in the US in 1977 to having sex with a 13-year-old.</p>
