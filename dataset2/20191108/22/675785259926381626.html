      <p>Marnie opened-up: “I really wanted a middle name but Casey just wouldn’t have it.”</p>
      <p>Casey started to giggle as he explained: “Because the middle names you were thinking of were a bit ‘leave it out’.”</p>
      <p>A disheartened Marnie then replied: “I thought they were really nice, but anyway.”</p>
      <p>It comes after first time dad Casey praised Marnie for carrying and giving birth to their son.</p>
