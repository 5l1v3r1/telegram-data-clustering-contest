      <h1>Nurmagomedov says McGregor needs 10 fights for rematch</h1>

      <p>MOSCOW -- Khabib Nurmagomedov said Friday that Conor McGregor would need to win 10 straight fights to earn a rematch for his UFC title.</p>
      <p>McGregor hasn't fought since Nurmagomedov beat him by submission for the UFC lightweight title in October last year.</p>
      <p>The Irish fighter last month outlined his plan for two fights leading up to a rematch with the Russian.</p>
      <p>That's not enough for Nurmagomedov.</p>
      <p>"As for a rematch, to fight for a belt in the UFC, I remember I had something like nine or 10 fights. If he wins 10 fights in a row, then that's completely possible," Nurmagomedov said.</p>
      <p>Nurmagomedov adds he's in negotiations to fight Tony Ferguson next, but wants it in New York rather than the UFC's preferred venue of Las Vegas.</p>
      <p>That's because he disagrees with the Nevada State Athletic Commission's decision to fine and suspend him for a post-fight brawl after his bout with McGregor.</p>
      <p>"They offered me to fight in Vegas in March, but I told them that if Vegas officially apologizes for wrongly fining me for that incident on October 6, 2018, then I'll fight there," he said.</p>
      <p>"If not, then they can assign me to another date. As far as I know, they're planning in April to hold (a fight card) somewhere in New York, so I'm saying I'm ready for April, or March if Las Vegas apologizes."</p>
