      <p>YouTube star KSI has clarified comments he made ahead of his highly-anticipated boxing match with Logan Paul, saying that he does not want to kill him.</p>
      <p>The social media star and amateur boxer had taken part in pre-fight banter with fellow YouTuber Paul at a press conference on Thursday, where he said to his rival: “You’re going to f***ing die.”</p>
      <p>KSI tweeted on Friday: “Just want to clarify a statement I made yesterday at the press conference.</p>

      <p>“I don’t intend to kill Logan physically tomorrow, I only intend to kill his youtube career and spirit.</p>
      <p>“After this fight, I still want Logan to be alive and well.”</p>
      <p>The press conference saw the pair trade insults, and American internet star Paul fired random maths questions at his British opponent.</p>
      <p>The YouTube stream of the press conference has been viewed more than 3.5 million times in the space of 24 hours.</p>
      <p>KSI, whose real name is Olajide William “JJ” Olatunji, has 5.1 million followers on Twitter and just over 20 million subscribers on his YouTube channel.</p>
