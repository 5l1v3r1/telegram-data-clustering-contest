      <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House is “very optimistic” it will reach a so-called phase one trade pact with China before the end of the year, a senior administration official said on Friday, adding that a deal would likely be struck before more tariffs take effect in mid-December.</p>
      <p>“We’re very optimistic that round one will be completed and, hopefully, signed before the end of this year,” Marc Short, chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence, told CNBC.</p>
      <p>Asked whether a deal would be reached before the United States puts more tariffs on Chinese imports on Dec. 15, Short said: “I think that it’s likely within that time line, but I don’t want to try to tie Mnuchin and Lighthizer’s hands to a specific deadline, because I don’t think there is one.”</p>
      <p>Short was referring to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, the top two American negotiators in talks with China.</p>
      <p>Officials from both countries on Thursday said China and the United States had agreed to roll back tariffs already put in place on each others’ goods in a “phase one” deal, but the idea has been met with stiff opposition within some quarters of the Trump administration.</p>
      <p>Trump, in comments that hit stock prices and the dollar, said on Friday he had not agreed to a tariff rollback.</p>
      <p>“I haven’t agreed to anything,” he told reporters at the White House.</p>
