      <h1>Unai Emery admits Leicester trip is "must-win" as pressure mounts on under-fire Arsenal boss</h1>
      <h2>Arsenal travel to Leicester knowing defeat could leave them nine points off the pace in the race for a top-four finish - and Emery's job hanging by a thread</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T22:30:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">John Cross, https://www.facebook.com/johncrossmirror/</a></address>
      <p>Unai Emery must do what has never been done before to save himself at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> .</p>
      <p>Once a manager loses the fans there is no way back and it feels like Emery has already reached the point of no return with Arsenal supporters.</p>
      <p>The stalemate at Vitoria Guimaraes in the Europa League in midweek was Arsenal’s fourth draw in a row, the fourth consecutive game they have surrendered a lead and the fear is it will be much worse at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> .</p>
      <p>Arsenal’s leaky defence against in-form Leicester and if they lose at the King Power Stadium it could leave Emery NINE points off a top-four place and his future in serious jeopardy.</p>

      <p>Emery did at least attempt to change the mood by sending out a more positive message while also admitting the season has been derailed from day one when Laurent Koscielny went on strike, Mesut Ozil and Sead Kolasinac were targeted by car jackers to the Granit Xhaka furore.</p>
      <p>“This a very big opportunity. After two matches at home that we drew, tomorrow is a very good opportunity. Yesterday the players worked and trained very well with a good spirit and they give me confidence,” said Emery.</p>
      <p>“The most important is our mentality and going there thinking: ‘We are Arsenal.’ And we will go there with confidence and also strong in our mentality to be together to go to work against them.</p>
      <p>“The circumstances - Ozil, Kolasinac, the Laurent Koscielny circumstances and if he was still here then he would still be captain and there would be no problem. But the team inside now, they are strong.</p>
      <p>"Is this must-win? Yes. But in our mind, for each match it is only to win.”</p>

      <p>The captaincy issue has only served to underline Emery’s lack of leadership as yesterday the Arsenal manager admitted that Xhaka has made himself unavailable as the fall-out from his row with the fans gets worse with every instalment.</p>
      <p>Emery has been ridiculed for holding a dressing room vote over who should get the captaincy - but actually it was not his idea and yet he has paid a heavy price for it.</p>
      <p>It was dreamed up by Arsenal’s psychologist David Priestley to try and share leadership duties.</p>
      <p>It was Priestley who last season convinced Emery it was a good idea to share the rabble-rousing “team huddle” duties before each game by getting different members of staff to do it.</p>
      <p>Ameesh Manek, who is primarily in charge of organising first team travel, did the pre-match ritual before the shock defeat to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> in April which put them on a run of three losses which cost them a place in the top four last season.</p>
      <p>Emery looks as vulnerable as Arsenal’s defence right now and, having struggled at Paris Saint Germain, this will surely be his last crack at managing a top club.</p>
      <p>Spaniard Emery, who won three back-to-back Europa League titles with Sevilla, has struggled to manage big names, his team lacks identity while the players look as if they are struggling with his instructions and tactics.</p>
      <p>Emery ostracised Ozil and then brought him back, plays Lucas Torreira out of position and has struggled to get the best out of £72m record signing Nicolas Pepe.</p>
      <p>His poor English does not help and his regular opening gambit - “good ebening” - causes him to be mocked behind his back by Arsenal’s players who are rapidly losing faith and confidence in his methods.</p>
      <p>It feels like a seismic moment in Arsenal’s season at Leicester because if they lose the gap from top four will be huge and will also show that they should have appointed Brendan Rodgers rather than Emery.</p>
