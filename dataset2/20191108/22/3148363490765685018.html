      <h1>Sanctuary County Frees Illegal Alien Accused of Molesting 11-Year-Old Girl</h1>
      <h2>An illegal alien charged with child sexual abuse was released into the United States by Montgomery County, Maryland officials — a sanctuary county that routinely shields criminal illegal aliens from deportation.</h2>

      <p>According to <i>ABC 7 News</i>‘ Kevin Lewis, 48-year-old illegal alien Luis Fredy Hernandez-Morales was <a href="https://twitter.com/ABC7Kevin/status/1192868128339963907">freed</a> by Montgomery County officials rather than being turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for arrest and deportation.</p>
      <p>Hernandez-Morales, according to Lewis, has been accused of molesting an 11-year-old girl and has been charged with child sexual abuse.</p>
      <p>Despite Montgomery County officials’ <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/07/maryland-officials-drop-sanctuary-policy-after-illegal-alien-sex-crimes/">claims</a> that they had begun handing criminal illegal aliens over to ICE agents — so long as ICE officials had filed a detainer and scheduled a pickup time — the sanctuary jurisdiction released Hernandez-Morales, who came to the U.S. illegally from Guatemala.</p>
      <p>The Hernandez-Morales case is just the latest where illegal aliens in Montgomery County have been accused of child sex crimes or rape within the last few months.</p>
      <p>In one of those cases, Breitbart News <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/09/17/ninth-illegal-alien-in-maryland-sanctuary-county-charged-with-rape/">detailed</a> how 23-year-old illegal alien Josue Gomez-Gonzalez allegedly raped a friend of his who was intoxicated. In another case, 26-year-old illegal alien Oluwakayode Adewole Adebusuyi had been <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/09/10/eighth-illegal-alien-accused-of-rape-in-maryland-was-freed-by-sanctuary-city/">released</a> by Montgomery County back into the general public after allegedly raping an intoxicated woman.</p>
