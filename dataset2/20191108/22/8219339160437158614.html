      <p>While many customers were hoping Apple would end the era of white-only AirPods with the launch of <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/airpods/">AirPods Pro</a>, they didnâ€™t debut in a black option. As itâ€™s done in the past, <a href="https://bit.ly/2Q6T1Hr">ColorWare is now out with custom colors</a> to create a unique pair of AirPods Pro in both matte and glossy finishes.</p>
      <p>ColorWare debuted its AirPods Pro custom color options with <a href="https://bit.ly/2Q6T1Hr">16 solid color</a> choices and <a href="https://bit.ly/2Q6T1Hr">16 metallic</a> ones. Both the solid and metallic colors are available in both glossy or matte finishes.</p>
      <p>Customers can choose colors for each AirPod Pro as well as the wireless charging case.Â As for pricing, ColorWare is charging $189 for the custom paint job, <a href="https://bit.ly/2Q6T1Hr">thatâ€™s $439 for the whole package</a> compared to $249 that AirPods Pro normally go for. If you donâ€™t want a custom color for your case, the price comes down to $389.</p>
      <p>Check out the custom color AirPods Pro configurator on <a href="https://bit.ly/2Q6T1Hr">ColoWareâ€™s website here</a>. Notably, thereâ€™s a 3-4 week shipping time right now, so get your orders in fast if youâ€™re hoping to have them for holiday gifts.</p>
