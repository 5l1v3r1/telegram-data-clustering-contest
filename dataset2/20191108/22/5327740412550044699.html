      <p>• Oct. 29, 7:39 p.m., 11000-block Commonwealth Cres.: Delta Fire requested Delta police for traffic control at a house fire. The homeowners returned home to find a fire had started at their residence. No one was injured. Delta police stayed on scene to ensure no flare ups continued overnight.</p>
      <p>• Oct. 31, 9:05 a.m., 8800-block 120th St.: Police observed a vehicle fail to stop for a marked stop sign while leaving a shopping area. A traffic stop was conducted.

      <p>• Oct. 31, various times and locations: Various bylaw complaints being made due to fireworks. Police were busy throughout the evening and into the early morning hours. Some large groups congregated at parks to let off fireworks. Police reminded residents to obtain a permit in the future. No significant issues.</p>
      <p>• Nov. 1, 10:18 p.m., 117A Street and 89A Avenue: A taxi driver contacted police to request their assistance with a passenger who was refusing to pay his bill.

      <p>• Nov. 2, 4:31 p.m., Bridlington Drive and 112th Street: A male contacted police to report that he observed people dumping a full bag of garbage in the bushes.

      <p>• Nov. 3, 3:15 a.m., 7900-block 120th St.: Police were conducting patrols when they observed a vehicle leaving the parking lot at a high rate of speed. A traffic stop was initiated.
