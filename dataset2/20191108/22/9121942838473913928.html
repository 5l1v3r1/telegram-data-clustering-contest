      <p>TULSA, Okla. (AP) — Jacob Rainey kicked a 23-yard game-winning field goal late in the fourth quarter and Tulsa rallied past UCF, knocking off the two-time defending American Athletic Conference champs 34-31 Friday night.</p>
      <p>The win was Tulsa’s first in conference play.</p>
      <p>The Golden Hurricanes (3-7, 1-5) stopped UCF on downs on the ensuing possession — a big third-down sack resulting in an incomplete pass by Dillon Gabriel on fourth-and-12. Tulsa ran out the final 87 seconds.</p>
      <p>Dillon threw for 290 yards but was picked off twice and sacked six times for a loss of 36 yards.</p>
      <p>Still, UCF (7-3, 4-2) led by as many as 11 points and was ahead 31-24 heading into the fourth quarter. Tulsa put together a 63-yard drive early in the final period, knotting the score on a Seth Boomer 17-yard TD pass to Sam Crawford Jr.</p>
      <p>Reggie Robinson II intercepted Gabriel and returned it 23 yards to the 18, setting up Rainey’s winning kick.</p>
      <p>Tulsa was outgained in both passing and rushing yards but scored 10 points off turnovers.</p>
