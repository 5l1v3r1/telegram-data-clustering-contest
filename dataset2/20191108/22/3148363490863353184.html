      <h1>Twitter Claims Naming Alleged Ukraine Whistleblower Isn't Against the Rules, but Suspends Users for It | Breitbart</h1>
      <h2>Twitter has stated in ongoing communication with Breitbart News that naming the alleged Ukraine whistleblower, Eric Ciaramella, would not be a breach of its rules against posting “personally identifiable information.” But multiple accounts that have been suspended by the platform for posting Ciaramella’s name.</h2>

      <p>Breitbart News sent an inquiry to Twitter after reports of multiple accounts being suspended or forced to delete their tweets after naming Ciaramella as the alleged whistleblower.</p>

      <p>According to a Twitter spokeswoman, “per the private information policy, any Tweets that include personally identifiable information about any individual, including the alleged whistleblower, would be in violation of the Twitter Rules.”</p>
      <p>A Twitter spokeswoman contacted Breitbart News after this article’s publication to clarify that posting the alleged whistleblower’s name is not a violation of its policies against personally identifiable information. However, screenshots from conservative Twitter users show that accounts posting Ciaramella’s name — and nothing else — have been suspended under the PII policy.</p>
      <p>Twitter said it is looking into the cause of these suspensions.</p>
      <p>If Twitter does indeed consider naming Ciaramella to be a violation of its rules, it appears to be having trouble enforcing them — numerous accounts, both verified and unverified, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=eric%20ciaramella&amp;src=typeahead_click">are still tweeting Ciaramella’s name</a>.</p>
      <p>Facebook also is blanket-banning references to the alleged whistleblower, including articles from Breitbart News and other publishers that have named him.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2019/11/08/facebook-removes-any-news-reporting-on-or-even-mention-of-who-the-whistleblower-is-alleged-to-be/">As Breitbart News reported earlier today</a>, the alleged whistleblower’s name has been reported widely across both conservative and non-conservative media, and has been mentioned by numerous public figures.</p>
      <blockquote>Multiple other publishers have named the alleged whistleblower or reported on outlets naming him, including <a href="https://heavy.com/news/2019/10/eric-ciaramella/">Heavy.com</a>, the <i><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/alleged-whistleblower-eric-ciaramella-was-biden-guest-at-state-department-banquet">Washington Examiner</a>, </i><a href="https://thefederalist.com/2019/10/30/anti-trump-whistleblower-worked-with-dnc-operative-who-sought-dirt-on-trump-from-ukrainian-officials/">The Federalist</a>, and the <a href="https://www.westernjournal.com/don-jr-defies-democrats-outs-alleged-whistleblower/">Western Journal</a>. Saagar Enjeti, Chief Washington Correspondent for <i>The Hill, </i><a href="https://twitter.com/esaagar/status/1189651557412986880">also tweeted</a> the alleged whistleblower’s name. Radio hosts <a href="https://twitter.com/marklevinshow/status/1192457634135367680">Mark Levin</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/glennbeck/status/1192283307842686976">Glenn Beck</a>, Students for Trump co-chair <a href="https://twitter.com/RyanAFournier/status/1192576780214964224">Ryan Fournier</a>, former Deputy Assistant to the President <a href="https://twitter.com/SebGorka/status/1192217964843556867">Sebastian Gorka</a>, bestselling author <a href="https://twitter.com/DineshDSouza/status/1189918034988818433">Dinesh D’Souza</a>, One America News host <a href="https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/1189660490198331393">Jack Posobiec</a>, and TownHall.com senior columnist <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/">Kurt Schlichter</a> are among the other public figures and major media personalities who have also named the alleged whistleblower. It isn’t only conservatives reporting on Ciaramella. <i>New York Magazine </i>and HuffPost contributor Yashar Ali identified Ciaramella as the alleged whistleblower in a <a href="https://twitter.com/JFNYC1/status/1192110481915469824">since-deleted tweet</a>. Ali claimed to have confirmed the identity with three sources.</blockquote>
      <p>Facebook has said it may reverse its policy on naming the alleged whistleblower if enough media outlets and public figures mention his name, but it appears that the threshold – whatever it is – has not yet been met. Twitter, meanwhile, has offered no such assurances at all.</p>
      <p><b>Update — </b>This article has been updated based on additional communication with Twitter to clarify its policies.</p>
