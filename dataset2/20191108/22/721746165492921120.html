      <h1>2019 League of Legends World Championship Finals: schedule and stream</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T22:32:15+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 22:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.polygon.com/users/Austen%20Goslin" target="_blank">Austen Goslin</a></address>
      <p>After an incredibly unpredictable World Championship tournament, Finals are finally here and they should look a little familiar. While the two teams aren’t the same as last year, the regions they represent are. LPL Champions FunPlus Phoenix will take on the LEC’s G2 Esports meaning that we’ll once again see a clash between Europe and China in the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/league-of-legends/2248"><i>League of Legends</i></a> World Finals.</p>
      <p>While many had doubts about FunPlus Phoenix after a very rough Group Stage, the Chinese side has thoroughly silenced its detractors. In the semifinal match against fellow-LPL side, Invictus Gaming, FunPlus handled last year’s World Champions with ease, knocking the team out in a three to one series win.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, G2 Esports, who was a favorite coming into this tournament and has been one of the best teams in the world throughout the 2019 season, looked a little shaky in their semifinal matchup against SKT. This may sound like warning bells should be ringing for G2, but it’s still too early to count them out. After all, SKT and Faker will always put up a fight on the Worlds Stage, so maybe a little adversity in the semifinals is exactly what G2 needed.</p>
      <p>You can watch all of the <i>League of Legends</i> 2019 World Championship Finals, including the opening ceremony starting at 7 a.m. ET on Sunday, Nov. 10. Finals will be streamed on Riot’s <a href="http://youtube.com/lolesports">YouTube</a> and <a href="http://twitch.tv/riotgames">Twitch</a> channel, as well as on <a href="http://lolesports.com/">lolesports.com</a>, where you can watch Pro View if you are a subscriber. Before the actual competition begins there will be a performance by <a href="https://www.riftherald.com/lol-skins/2019/10/29/20919723/true-damage-akali-senna-qiyana-yasuo-ekko-skins-giants">True Damage</a>, as well as Chrissy Costanza and Cailin Russo, the artists behind this year’s <a href="https://www.riftherald.com/lol-worlds/2019/10/8/20905235/2019-worlds-anthem-phoenix-lol">Worlds anthem, “Phoenix.”</a></p>
