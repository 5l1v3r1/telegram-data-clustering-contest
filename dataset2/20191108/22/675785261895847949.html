      <h1>Arsenal 'to try and poach two Man Utd scouts' as part of backroom overhaul</h1>
      <h2>The Gunners are undergoing a restructure in their academy system, headed up by Per Mertesacker, which has already seen senior staff members depart the club in recent weeks</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T22:21:27+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 22:21</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> are reportedly looking to nab two of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United's</a> scouting team as they continue their backroom overhaul.</p>
      <p>The Gunners have already begun making adjustments in their youth set-up, with head of youth recruitment Steve Morrow among the first to depart the club.</p>
      <p>Now <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7662181/Arsenal-ready-rid-Granit-Xhaka-offer-Swiss-star-Bundesliga-sides.html">the Mail</a> report they are eyeing United youth scouts Dave Harrison and Lyndon Tomlinson, along with Man City's Joe Shields to spearhead the youth recruitment department.</p>
      <p>Both Harrison and Tomlinson were on City's books before switching across Manchester in 2017, and are regarded as two of the best in their field.</p>
      <p>Arsenal have had great success in recent seasons with a number of youth prospects stepping up to join the first team.</p>

      <p>Joe Willock, Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Bukayo Saka have all come through the academy ranks, but the Gunners want to improve their recruitment processes lower down the chain.</p>
      <p>Harrison was at City when they poached Kelechi Iheanacho from Taye Academy, who went on to make a number of first-team appearances before being sold to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> for £25 million.</p>
      <p>Former Arsenal captain Per Mertesacker is now manager of the Gunners' academy, and is in charge of the restructuring.</p>

      <p>The shake-up comes following under-23's coach Freddie Ljungberg's switch to first-team affairs, which has been a great success thus far, but they are now looking to start a new generation of staff in the academy.</p>
      <p>Mertesacker told <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/11/per-mertesacker-interview-arsenal-head-of-academy">the Guardian</a> in September: "The amount of staff we have in academies is ... I’ve never seen anything like it.</p>
      <p>"It’s good to take care of the players but sometimes I get confused by the number of people who have an impact on one kid – we’re talking 100 people or more.</p>
      <p>"It’s quite a heavy load. On one hand you’ve got to embrace it and try to get the best people in the academy."</p>
      <p>His words come off the back of what Arsenal's Head of football, Raul Sanllehi's comments in the summer, who said: "Identifying, recruiting and developing young players is a key part of our strategy.</p>
      <p>“We have some great talent coming through our younger age groups and, like all top clubs, the challenge is to help them make the most of their abilities."</p>
