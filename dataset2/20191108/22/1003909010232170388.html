      <h1>A home with room to gather the whole family around the dining table</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T22:07:42+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 22:07</time> by <a rel="author">Cindy Stephen, for the Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>There’s an eight-foot long table sitting in Jessica Callaway’s garage just waiting to be placed in the new home that she and partner Bryan Masson are building in Airdrie.</p>
      <p>She purchased the table specifically for the large dining area of their new house and is pumped about hosting Christmas this year in a more comfortable space.</p>
      <p>“Our family will all fit. We don’t have to put extensions in a table and then take them out just to have more space,” says Callaway, who takes possession of their home by Genesis Builders Group on Dec. 12.</p>
      <p>Between crowded family gatherings in their current house in Airdrie’s Sage Woods neighbourhood and two growing daughters, the need for more space prompted their search for a new home.</p>
      <p>“We have a good starter home — it’s just small. There’s a lack of storage and there isn’t an ensuite. We have one bathroom for all of us. It’s a bit squishy and it seemed like a good time to level up,” says Callaway, a teacher who has lived in Airdrie for 12 years. Masson is also a teacher and commutes to Beiseker, about 45 kilometres east.</p>
      <p>“We love our neighbourhood, so when lots opened up nearby in Bayview, we were anxious to purchase one,” she says.</p>
      <p>They went with Genesis based on previous experience.</p>
      <p>“We had a resale home a while back, originally built by Genesis. It was older and when we moved in, we had a couple of concerns. They sent a whole team of people over even though we didn’t build it, so I liked the service,” she says.</p>
      <p>When she and Masson opened the door of the Lily show home in Bayview, the open main floor space instantly sealed the deal.</p>
      <p>“That entertaining space was the biggest piece. That’s what we’re missing now. We’re so limited. We’ll have two birthdays — one for friends and one for family because we can’t have everyone together,” she says.</p>
      <p>The Lily starts at 2,101 square feet with three bedrooms, 2.5 bathrooms, upstairs bonus room and laundry. They’re having the basement developed with a fourth bedroom, another full bathroom and a rec room.</p>
      <p>She and Masson bumped the house out two extra feet to make it even larger. It required a 40-foot lot, which they found right across the street from the pond.</p>
      <p>“It’s perfect because there won’t be any houses built across from us. We’ll have water views from our bonus room,” she says.</p>
      <p>Also waiting in Callaway’s garage for move-in day are newly purchased bar stools to go around the new kitchen island, which she’s painting navy blue.</p>
      <p>“We have light coloured laminate flooring and the cabinetry is all white. We upgraded to a herringbone-style backsplash and an Italian-print tile around the fireplace. We chose bronze hardware so everything will be light and bright but warm at the same time,” she says.</p>
      <p>The Lily show home in Bayview was recently sold, so Genesis replaced it with the Marconi three-bedroom, two-storey model home. Priced from $485,000, the Lily floor plan is still available and there are plenty of good 38-foot lots to accommodate it, says Stephanie Garrett, area sales manager.</p>
      <p>“It’s a very open concept layout. It feels even bigger because we have very large windows in our houses. The open railing on the staircase makes it feel like there’s a nice amount of space in the home,” she says.</p>
      <p>Bayview is the third community of Genesis Land Development’s Bayview, Bayside Estate and Canals neighbourhood. Genesis is the exclusive builder in Phase 3 of the 10-phase community, which has laned homes, front-drive bungalow and two-storey homes starting in the low $300,000s to the mid-$500,000s.</p>
      <p>A new K-4 elementary school was just greenlit by the province for the area, and Garrett says the highly rated Nose Creek Elementary school is only a five-minute walk.</p>
      <p>“I’ve heard nothing but great things about it,” Garrett says.</p>
      <p>Unique waterways, pond features and an abundance of park space have made this trio of neighbourhoods a hot topic for Genesis since development began in 1997.</p>
