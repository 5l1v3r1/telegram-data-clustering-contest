      <h1>A shopping day bigger than Thanksgiving, Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T22:35:57+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 22:35</time> by <a rel="author">Kate Gibson</a></address>
      <p>"Singles Day" may sound lonely, but those taking part this November 11 can find some togetherness in what amounts to the world's largest annual shopping spree.</p>
      <p>In terms of money spent, China's one-day festival of consumption is likely to eclipse Thanksgiving, Black Friday and Cyber Monday — combined, according to Adobe Analytics. The retail data tracking service estimates that the long U.S. holiday shopping weekend this year will generate total retail sales of $29 billion — that would be less than the $30 billion produced in 2018 by the 24-hour unofficial Chinese shopping holiday known as Singles Day.</p>
      <p>What's morphed into an astounding revenue-generating enterprise started out among Chinese university students holding parties to celebrate being single in 1993, only to be co-opted by China-based retailing giant Alibaba 16 years later.</p>

      <p>Alibaba, China's version of Amazon, marked down merchandise in a marketing campaign that had other e-commerce companies soon doing the same. A decade later, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/forget-black-friday-singles-day-is-the-biggest-shopping-event-youve-never-heard-of/">the event</a> now gives Amazon Prime Day a run for its money.</p>
      <p>This year, more than 200,000 brands are participating, Alibaba <a href="https://www.alibabagroup.com/en/news/article?news=p191021a">said</a>. The company is hyping the event with a "Countdown Gala" featuring a performance by pop singer Taylor Swift. </p>

      <p>American companies are also getting in on the act. Nearly a quarter of U.S. retailers plan to run promotions for Singles Day, according to Adobe, which surveyed more than 400 U.S. retailers with annual sales in excess of $500,000.</p>
      <p>That said, U.S.-China trade tensions could ding American brands taking part this year, concludes another study by global consultancy AlixPartners.</p>
      <p>Chinese consumers will spend 54% more this year than in 2018, but 78% said they would think twice about buying U.S. products due to loyalty to their country, AlixPartners found in a recent <a href="https://www.alixpartners.com/media-center/press-releases/neue-alixpartners-studie-singles-day-2019/">survey</a> of more than 2,000 Chinese consumers.</p>
