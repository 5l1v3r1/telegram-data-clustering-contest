      <h2>Liverpool are six points clear of their title rivals going into Sunday's showdown at Anfield - but Klopp says Man City are still "a step ahead"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T22:30:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">David Maddock, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-maddock/</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool may never have the resources to rival Man City’s billionaire route to Premier League dominance.</p>
      <p>But Jurgen Klopp believes there is another way to end City’s stranglehold on the title – and create the best team in the world.</p>
      <p>He argues the Mersey club are now so good that the only players who could ­possibly make them better are practically unbuyable.</p>
      <p>The German is not about to run the up the white flag, however.</p>
      <p>His team pushed City to the limits last season in arguably the highest-quality title battle in history.</p>
      <p>And even as he dismissed the notion of spending eye-watering sums to bring the likes of French star Kylian Mbappe to ­Anfield, he offered real hope to Kop fans by saying it is possible to achieve perfection without breaking the bank.</p>

      <p>“Are we capable of beating the best team in the world? Yes we are," he said. "If you win against the best team in the world, then it makes you the best team in the world.</p>
      <p>“But I think on a normal day City are still a step ahead. That is how it is. I don’t want to make us smaller than we are because we are incredible at times.</p>
      <p>“But we still have a lot of scope for improvement. It is not too important what you are in this moment; what’s important is what you can be in the ­future.</p>
      <p>"But you have to use everything. We all ask for that and it is necessary. Keep up a performance level and then we make the next step. That is what we do in life and in football.</p>
      <p>“It doesn’t make us smaller, we still want to beat Man City.”</p>
      <p>Klopp is not playing mind games. He’s not trying to ease the pressure on his side by trying to portray them as underdogs – he shakes his head vigorously at even the idea of that.</p>
      <p>Yet he is also a realist. In the summer, he said, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> didn’t make signings because the players who would improve a team that took 97 Premier League points and won the Champions League are too expensive.</p>
      <p>The Reds spent more than £50million on Naby ­Keitra (below) but James Milner was a free when he arrived at ­Anfield in 2015.</p>
      <p>“The players we thought about to make this team better, they were really expensive and we couldn’t spend the money,” Klopp said.</p>
      <p>“The squad is really good and if you want to improve it you have to do it with the right players and not with any player.”</p>
      <p>And Klopp reckons his squad has massive scope for improvement.</p>
      <p>“This team is in a wonderful age and they really still have space for improvement,” he said. “Now I think it is easier to live the life of a Liverpool supporter!”</p>
