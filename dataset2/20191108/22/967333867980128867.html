        <b>The US first lady, whose Be Best campaign aims to help challenged children, among other things, visited the Boston Medical Centre, where volunteers cuddle babies born with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome because their mothers were using drugs during pregnancy. However, some tried to show that she was not welcome.</b>
      </p>
      <p>US First Lady Melania Trump has been lambasted on social media and <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911061077234155-boston-hospital-staffers-oppose-melania-trumps-visit-to-mark-programme-on-opioid-addicted-babies/">rallied</a> against in Boston over her visit to the city’s medical centre, which has a special cuddling programme for babies with withdrawal symptoms. Its volunteers help children who suffer from Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) as their mothers, addicted to opiates, took drugs during pregnancy.</p>

      <p>With her visit, FLOTUS, whose Be Best Initiative was launched to help children facing problems, hoped to attract attention to the BMC’s project.</p>
      <blockquote>“As you may know, this is an issue I am very focused on. I hope today’s visit helps shine a light on programs like yours. It is so important to acknowledge and show gratitude for what you are doing to help”, she said, apparently referring to the Trump administration’s fight against opioids.</blockquote>
      <p>However, she drew the attention that she might have hardly desired. As Express.co.uk reports, while the first lady was told to cancel her visit, some 200 people protested outside the centre.</p>

      <p>Hospital staffers reportedly held signs, while others chose to send their message, wearing white coats with the caption “we really care do u?” on the back, alluding to her infamous “I don't really care, do u?” jacket that she wore at the height of the border crisis.</p>
      <p>Twitter users were also not very welcoming.</p>

      <p>But many lambasted the protesters, noting that Melania Trump went there to help for a good cause.</p>
