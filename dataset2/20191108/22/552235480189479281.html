      <h2>The Chief Executive wants to cast the club's net far and wide in the quest for a new boss.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T22:29:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 22:29</time> by <a rel="author">Fraser Wilson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/fraser-wilson/</a></address>
      <p>Leeann Dempster is scouring Europe in the search for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/paul-heckingbottom">Paul Heckingbottom</a>’s successor at Hibs.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jack-ross">Jack Ross</a> is the frontrunner for the Easter Road job but Dempster insists the club is still in the process of identifying candidates before opening talks.</p>
      <p>The chief executive faced the media yesterday four days after Heckingbottom was fired following a run of five draws in a winless streak that stretches back to the opening league game of the season.</p>
      <p>And she says the club has a more “open-minded” approach to identifying a new boss than when Heckingbottom was appointed.</p>
      <p>That includes looking beyond the shores of the UK. Names including sacked Barnsley boss Daniel Stendel and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/henrik-larsson">Henrik Larsson</a> have been touted.</p>

      <p>And <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/leeann-dempster">Dempster</a> said: “I guess I'm slightly more open to a different sort of coach and structure that they might bring to the club than we were last time.</p>
      <p>“We had a predetermined direction of travel last time and now we are a little more open.</p>
      <p>“We've developed a strong structure at the club and we wanted someone to come in who would really relish that, which Paul did. He really utilised everything we have built behind the scenes here.</p>
      <p>“We still want that to be the case but we need to cast our net wider.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“We need to be looking not just in the UK but also across Europe. I wouldn't say we were closed minded before, but this is recruitment number four, and after the qualities Paul and the others brought we want to see what else is out there.</p>
      <p>“That could be someone outwith the UK and who hasn't certainly managed in the UK. We were resistant to that before.</p>
      <p>“Perhaps someone who hasn't managed in the UK but has played in the UK before and knows the football here.</p>
      <p>“We are still in the identification process at the moment.”</p>
      <p>Dempster revealed she agonised over the decision to bullet Heckingbottom just a third of the way into the Premiership season.</p>

      <p>But when expectation turned into hope going into matches she knew it was time to act.</p>
      <p>“I don't think this was as obvious and straightforward as people think. I really thought the guys [management staff] could reach their potential here.</p>
      <p>“The guys worked really hard, tried lots of different things, lots of different tactics, to try and turn things around.</p>
      <p>“But latterly we were going into games a little bit more in hope than expectation. When it gets to that point, you need to start thinking very seriously about it.</p>
      <p>“I don't think I've sat at a match this season and felt entirely comfortable.</p>
      <p>“It took a few days for me to make the decision and get my head around it. It wasn't as obvious for me as it was for some supporters.”</p>
      <p>Dempster insists she doesn’t feel under any additional pressure to get this appointment right with new owner Ron Gordon involved in the process.</p>
      <p>She said: “I always feel under pressure. You obviously always try to make the right decisions but sometimes we make the wrong decision.</p>
      <p>“The key thing is to make more right decisions than wrong ones and, obviously, this is a very important one.”</p>
