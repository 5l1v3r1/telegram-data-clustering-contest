      <p>A landlord has pleaded guilty to failing to get the gas appliances checked in a home he rented out.</p>
      <p>Thomas Brumby, aged 42, attended Plymouth Crown Court to admit two counts of breaching health and safety laws.</p>
      <p>He pleaded guilty to going at least a year without having his appliances and flue checked between 2015 and 2018.</p>
      <p>Barrister Sam Jones, for the Health and Safety Executive, said that Brumby had submitted a basis of plea – or his version of events.</p>
      <p>He said: “He says that he made efforts to contact the defendant to arrange for an inspection of the boiler to take place in the course of the tenancy.</p>
      <p>“The prosecution written response does not accept that.”</p>
      <p>Judge Paul Darlow said that case would have to be adjourned for a Newton hearing – or a fact-finding hearing without a jury.</p>
      <p>Brumby, of Canterbury Drive, <a href="http://www.plymouthlive.com/all-about/whitleigh">Whitleigh</a>, was released on bail for a date to be fixed.</p>
