      <p>PARIS (Reuters) - British rocker Pete Doherty has been arrested in Paris for buying drugs, the Paris prosecutor’s office said on Friday.</p>
      <p>Doherty, 40, shot to fame as singer for the Libertines in the 2000s and gained a bad boy public image over drugs and run-ins with the police.</p>
      <p>“Pete Doherty was placed in custody overnight for the acquisition of narcotic products,” a spokesman for the Paris prosecutor’s office said, without elaborating.</p>
      <p>Doherty, the former boyfriend of model Kate Moss, has been arrested for drug offences on numerous occasions.</p>
      <p>French media reported the former Babyshambles frontman was detained during an alleged drug deal in the Pigalle neighborhood in northern Paris, a district known for its late-night bars.</p>
      <p>The prosecutor’s office did not confirm this.</p>
      <p>A representative for Doherty declined to comment.</p>
