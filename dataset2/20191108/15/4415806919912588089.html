      <p>Emilia Clarke believes her upcoming festive film is anti-Brexit.</p>

      <p>The actress told BBC Radio 4’s Front Row that the script reflects the “politically active” worldview of Thompson.</p>
      <p>Asked on the show if the film was “anti-Brexit”, the star said: “Yes, definitely.</p>
      <p>“You get to see on a cinema screen someone’s point of view as someone who was not born in this country, but who is here and who is living a life and just trying to get through.”</p>
      <p>She added: “It really is a journey of self-discovery and self-acceptance, and acceptance on a broad scale – this to the backdrop of Brexit, and that’s a lot to do with acceptance.”</p>
      <p>The film sees Clarke play a floundering shop worker whose family has fled the former Yugoslavia.</p>
      <p>Dame Emma co-stars as her mother in the Christmas romantic comedy, and Clarke believes the film reflects her views.</p>
      <p>She said: “Emma Thompson and Greg Wise (her husband) are politically active, and they would never write a script that wasn’t in line with the way they thought, so it’s there.”</p>
      <p>Front Row airs weeknights at 7.15pm on Radio 4 on BBC Sounds.</p>
