      <p>A Rutherglen mum and daughter, who both won their battles with life-threatening illnesses, are now helping others thanks to their own healing hands.</p>
      <p>Hayley Ferguson was only two when she was struck by bacterial meningitis.</p>
      <p>After her heart gave out three times, paramedics feared toddler Hayley might not make it to Yorkhill Hospital for Sick Children alive.</p>
      <p>Frantic parents Carol and Andrew watched their little girl fight for life in intensive care for over two weeks.</p>
      <p>After an operation to graft skin on to her knees, Hayley was finally allowed home.</p>
      <p>Although she recovered and grew into a healthy schoolgirl, the toll the disease took on her brain hampered her mental development, and has presented lifelong struggles for Hayley, who’s now 26.</p>
      <p>“Through school, Hayley had issues,” explained Carol.</p>
      <p>“I knew she was bright. She was fantastic at writing poems. But she was not picking things up. If I told her to tidy her bedroom, she would not know where to start. Her teachers didn’t understand.”</p>

      <p>A cognitive behaviourial therapist confirmed that Hayley had difficulty “piecing things together,” taking longer to achieve tasks and her brain cannot think about more than one thing at a time.</p>
      <p>Although the therapist’s sequence tests highlighted that she did excel in certain areas, they concluded that her short-term memory, concentration and organisational skills were impaired.</p>
      <p>When Hayley left home to move in with her boyfriend, the stress of independent living became too much and she had to cut the hours she works at Tesco Bank’s contact centre.</p>
      <p>But her childhood brush with death and its lasting effect wasn’t the only health scare to hit the Ferguson family.</p>
      <p>In 2013, at the age of 51, mum Carol noticed changes in her right breast.</p>
      <p>A mammogram and ultrasound scan detected a lump – and doctors told Carol that she had stage 2 breast cancer.</p>
      <p>The diagnosis – which was treated through surgery and a course of radiotherapy – shook Carol and her family to the core.</p>
      <p>“You come through certain things in your life, and your safety bubble has gone,” she said.</p>
      <p>“I have come to be very aware that things can happen to you at any time. I lost my brother in a house fire 20 years ago. Through it, you become stronger.</p>
      <p>“I have to think there are an awful lot of worse situations. If you see your way through it, it means you can empathise with people more than you did before.”</p>

      <p>Both mum and daughter’s experiences have caused them to re-examine their lives and priorities, and to take nothing for granted.</p>
      <p>It was the chance meeting a year ago with Lynne Dunlop, owner of the Western School of Massage, that came as an awakening for the pair.</p>
      <p>They were so inspired by Lynne’s knowledge and passion for the university-accredited courses taught at her school, that in January, Hayley and Carol signed up as students.</p>
      <p>The knowledge they acquired led to them receiving their diploma in Swedish massage in September.</p>
      <p>And the mum-and-daughter team have now launched their own business, Hands On Massage.</p>
      <p>Based in a converted consultation and treatment room in Carol’s home, the pair offer clients bespoke, high quality massage treatments in a tranquil, secure environment.</p>
      <p>“This is very much a new journey for me,” said Hayley, who will marry finance Callan Anderson in June.</p>
      <p>“I have never done anything quite like this. I have never been so confident and passionate and excited for anything before.</p>
      <p>“It’s the first time I’ve thought I am good at something and capable of studying and learning while enjoying what I was doing. It’s the first time I have felt I have not been held back by the struggles I have had.”</p>
      <p>The new direction their lives have taken has also given a fresh new outlook to go-gettter Carol, who on a whim whisked husband Andrew to Japan to celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary. You think you cherish life, and you probably do a bit,” she said.</p>
      <p>“But then you think, ‘I could just have been gone’. And it’s always there in the back of your mind. ‘Is the cancer going to come back’?</p>
      <p>“That’s why you do things, because you can. Just go for it.”</p>
