      <h1>How to watch the ATP Finals</h1>
      <h2>The end of the tennis year is here - here's how to watch the Nitto ATP Finals live, either streaming online or on the TV</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T15:41:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 15:41</time> by <a rel="author">Dominic Preston</a></address>
      <p>The ATP World Tour Finals are the annual season-closing event in the tennis world, pitting the year's best eight singles players and doubles duos up against each other in one big showdown.</p>
      <p>Once again the tournament is taking place at London's O2 Arena, its home for the last few years, until it moves to Turin in 2021. Here's everything you need to know about when it's taking place, who's playing, how to watch live, and how to get some of the last few tickets.</p>
      <h3>When are the ATP Finals?</h3>
      <p>The World Tour Finals are taking place in London from <b>10-17 November 2019</b>. There are two singles matches and two doubles matches each day except the final Sunday, with the first six days devoted to the group stages (<a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/how-to/entertainment/watch-atp-finals-3686365/#format">more on that below</a>), the semi-finals on Saturday 16th, and the finals on Sunday 17th.</p>
      <h3>Who's playing?</h3>
      <p>First up, British hopes are limited. Andy Murray is still recuperating from hip surgery, so is nowhere near the top 8 singles players, while current British number one Kyle Edmund also missed out - he's ranked 68th in the world right now.</p>
      <p>Even Jamie Murray didn't make it into the final roster this year, for the first time in a few years, but Joe Salisbury is repping Britain in the doubles, alongside his American partner Rajeev Ram.</p>
      <p>Still, that doesn't mean there aren't any big names to watch. Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, and Roger Federer are all competing in the singles, so there should still be plenty of excitement.</p>
      <p>Here's the full singles draw:</p>
      <table bordered="">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <b>Group Andre Agassi</b>
          </td>

      <h3>How to watch on TV or online</h3>
      <p>Probably the easiest way to watch the tennis this year is through Amazon Prime. The streaming giant has <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=16184708031&amp;ascsubtag=06-3686365-11-0000000">rights for almost the whole ATP Tour</a>, including the Finals, so you'll be able to stream the tennis on your PC, phone, smart TV, games console, or more.</p>
      <p>Of course you do have to pay for Prime, with Prime Video from £7.99/$8.99 per month, but if you've not tried it before you can get a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/video/offers/?ascsubtag=06-3686365-11-0000000">30-day free trial</a> which will cover the full tournament and then some.</p>
      <p>If you're in the UK and want to watch on TV, coverage rights are shared by the BBC and Sky Sports. Sky is by far the better bet if you have it though, airing every single match from the tournament on either Sky Sports Mix, Sky Sports Arena, or Sky Sports Main Event. If you don't have Sky Sports you can <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=11005&amp;awinaffid=254429&amp;clickref=06-3686365-11-0000000&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sky.com%2Fshop%2Ftv%2Fsports%2F">sign up here</a>.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, it's usually cheaper to sign up for the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3686365-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fhow-to%2Fentertainment%2Fwatch-atp-finals-3686365%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nowtv.com%2Fpromo%2Fsky-sports">Now TV Sky Sports pass</a> -  it costs £14.99 to get a full week (so you can watch almost the whole tournament), and right now it's only £20 for a month, which is the better bet. You can watch Now TV through your computer, phone, tablet, or smart TV - though if you just want to use your phone, you're better off with the budget-friendly £5.99 mobile pass.</p>
      <p>If you'd rather not pay for Sky, the BBC has a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3686365-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fhow-to%2Fentertainment%2Fwatch-atp-finals-3686365%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.co.uk%2Fsport%2Ftennis%2F50235579">tentative coverage schedule</a>. Play every day except the final is on BBC Two from 2pm (so the afternoon matches) - note that this means only half the tournament's matches will be shown live on the BBC, and you'll have to turn to Sky to watch the evening's tennis. Coverage of the final will take place from 6pm on BBC Two. </p>
      <p>You'll also be able to watch the BBC coverage online through the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3686365-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fhow-to%2Fentertainment%2Fwatch-atp-finals-3686365%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.co.uk%2Fsport%2Ftennis">BBC Sport website</a> or app, where you should be able to watch from your computer, smartphone, tablet, or smart TV, though we expect this will be limited to the same matches the BBC is airing on TV.</p>
      <p>If you're in the US and want to watch on TV, your main option is <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3686365-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fhow-to%2Fentertainment%2Fwatch-atp-finals-3686365%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.espn.com%2Ftennis">ESPN</a>. Remember that match times are in the UK, so the US will get them in the morning and afternoon, rather than the afternoon and evening.</p>
      <p>Finally, wherever you are in the world you can also watch every match on <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3686365-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fhow-to%2Fentertainment%2Fwatch-atp-finals-3686365%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tennistv.com%2F">Tennis TV</a>, the ATP's official streaming platform. You can choose to pay either monthly or annually, and it includes almost every ATP tournament (but not the WTA, Davis Cup, or any of the Grand Slams). Bear in mind though: now that <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/amazonprime?ascsubtag=06-3686365-11-0000000">Amazon Prime</a> has streaming rights for the ATP tour it's probably better value to just grab that instead.</p>
      <h3>How to buy tickets</h3>
      <p>If you live in (or near) London and want to get down to the O2 to watch some of the action live and in person, it's still possible. The <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3686365-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fhow-to%2Fentertainment%2Fwatch-atp-finals-3686365%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nittoatpfinals.com%2Fen%2Ftickets%3Faff%3DNATPF_WEB_NATPF_HEADER">official ticketing site for the tournament</a> has tickets available for every day except the final (at the time of writing), with the option to buy tickets for either the afternoon or evening session (each of which gets you one singles and one doubles match) or a full-day ticket for a full four matches.</p>
      <p>However, if you've got your heart set on the final, there are some tickets for that still available on <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3686365-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fhow-to%2Fentertainment%2Fwatch-atp-finals-3686365%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.stubhub.co.uk%2Fnitto-atp-finals-tickets%2Fgrouping%2F728651%2F">Stubhub</a>, along with all the other dates.</p>
      <h3><anchor name="format"/>What's the tournament format?</h3>
      <p>The ATP World Tour Finals are a bit different to most of the other tournaments through the year. Rather than a knock-out format, the contest uses the round robin structure. </p>
      <p>That means that across the first six days, each player (or doubles pair) will play every other player in their group, for a total of three matches each. The top two players/teams from each group will advance to Saturday's semi-finals, and the winners of those matches play in Sunday's final.</p>
      <p>Players get 200 ATP ranking points per round robin win, 400 for a semi-final win, and 500 for a final win - for a potential total of 1500 points for an undefeated champion. Meanwhile prize money goes up to a potential $2,871,000 for an undefeated singles champion, and $533,000 for doubles - again, with the final money depending slightly on how many matches they win along the way.</p>
      <p>All the singles matches are the best of three sets, with tie-breaks, including the final. All doubles matches are two sets with a match tie-break.</p>
