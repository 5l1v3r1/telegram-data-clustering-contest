      <h1>OnePlus 7 Pro quietly loses its base and top models in the US, only 8GB remains</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T15:10:12+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 15:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/nexusben1/" target="_blank">Ben Schoon</a></address>
      <p>The OnePlus 7 Pro debuted in early 2019 with three different models available, but the company has quietly removed two of those options since the <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/10/18/where-to-buy-oneplus-7t/">OnePlus 7T hit the market</a>.</p>
      <p>While the rest of the world just got the OnePlus 7T Pro, the OnePlus 7 Pro is sticking around in the US for a while. The device is <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/05/24/oneplus-7-pro-review-super-charged-superphone-video/">still one of the best Android smartphones</a> on the market today, but if you were hoping to save some money on the base model or get some extra memory on the top-tier option, you’re out of luck.</p>
      <p>We noticed earlier this week and it was further <a href="https://twitter.com/Samsung_News_/status/1192684016903901184?s=19">mentioned on Twitter</a> that OnePlus has removed two of the 7 Pro models <a href="https://www.oneplus.com/oneplus-7pro">from its website in the United States</a>. No longer can you get the 6GB + 128GB variant of the OnePlus 7 Pro or the 12GB + 256GB variant. It’s a shame to see those go away, but the 8GB + 256GB version was always the best model for most people.</p>
      <p>Notably, at the moment, the 8GB + 256GB variant <a href="https://www.oneplus.com/oneplus-7pro">is on sale for $649</a>, the same price the 6GB model previously sold for.</p>
