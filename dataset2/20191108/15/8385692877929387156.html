      <p>In Best Buy's early <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">Black Friday sale</a>, you can get the Skullcandy HESH 3 wireless headphones for 50-percent off of their regular price.</p>
      <p>That brings them down to just $49.99.</p>
      <p>These are a really great pair of wireless headphones at $100, now with them below $50, this is a pair that you can't afford to miss out on.</p>

      <p>The Skullcandy HESH 3 are a pretty understated pair of headphones, in terms of looks. These are not flashy, and come in a matte black color (also available in a matte gray and red color). They also have some pretty thick ear cups, which makes them feel really comfortable on your head.</p>
      <p>Skullcandy has some pretty large drivers, about 40mm, in each ear. That's going to give you a ton of sound out of each ear cup. Making it really great for those that love to blast their music. The bass is pretty decent, it's not booming like a pair of Sony headphones might be. But it's good. There is also some really crisp mids and highs that will be great for audiophiles.</p>
      <p>On the Skullcandy HESH 3 there is a built-in microphone, allowing you to take phone calls on the headphones, without needing to take them off and turn off Bluetooth to take a call. That's a pretty useful feature, to be honest.</p>

      <p>When it comes to battery life, we're looking at around 22 hours on a single charge. Now that is less than the Sony WH-1000XM3 that we wrote about earlier. But given the price and size of these, 22 hours is still quite decent.</p>
      <p>And Skullcandy has a nice fast charging feature. Where you can plug these in for about 10 minutes and get around four hours of playback. Makes it a great way to quickly charge them before the gym, so you can still listen to your tunes while you work out.</p>
      <p>Finally, there is no active noise cancellation on the Skullcandy HESH 3, but instead, you get noise isolation. Basically, what this means is that you're not going to get a lot of sound into your ears, outside of your headphones. Because the HESH 3 are going to cover up your entire ear. It's not quite noise cancellation, but works almost in the same way.</p>
