      <p>LAHORE, Pakistan (Reuters) - Pakistan will allow Nawaz Sharif to leave the country for medical treatment, its foreign minister told Reuters in an interview on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“Doctors are recommending that he perhaps needs to go abroad for further examination,” foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said.</p>
      <p>“If that is what the medical treatment requires, the government has been positive. The prime minister has said everything possible should be done to show his life is protected.”</p>
      <p>Three-time PM Sharif, 69, was released on bail last month from a seven-year sentence for corruption after repeated medical issues.</p>
