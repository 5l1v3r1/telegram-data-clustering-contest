      <p>(CNN) - Lufthansa says it hopes to resume a normal flight schedule on Saturday after two days of strikes forced it to cancel 1,500 flights, disrupting the travel plans of 200,000 customers.</p>
      <p>Germany's largest airline said in a statement Friday that flight operations will resume "as far as possible" on Saturday, but that there could still be cancellations or delays.</p>
      <p>A strike by flight attendants on Thursday and Friday was worse than anticipated, affecting 200 more flights and 20,000 more passengers than Lufthansa had initially predicted.</p>
      <p>The airline was forced to operate a "special flight plan" during the strike, with only 4,500 of the 6,000 planned flights taking off.</p>
      <p>Frankfurt Airport's departure board showed that flights to the United States, India and Canada were among those canceled.</p>
      <p>Customers can rebook on the airline for free within 10 days, Lufthansa said. Domestic travelers have the option to exchange their flight for a train ticket.</p>
      <p>Lufthansa has roughly 135,000 employees and a fleet of more than 350 aircraft. It operates out of airport hubs in Frankfurt, Munich, Zurich and Vienna.</p>
      <p>Lufthansa said that it would enter talks with striking unions, including the Independent Flight Attendants Organization (UFO), which is locked in a dispute with the airline over its legal status.</p>
      <p>The union has accepted the offer of weekend talks and will then decide whether to undertake formal arbitration, UFO official Nicoley Baublies told Reuters.</p>
      <p>The strikes will not affect other airlines in the Lufthansa group, such as Brussels Airlines, Austrian Airlines and low-cost carrier Eurowings.</p>
