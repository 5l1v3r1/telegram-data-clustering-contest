      <h1>More Than 2 Million Pounds of Chicken Were Recalled for Possible Metal Contamination</h1>

      <p>More than 2 million pounds of chicken have been recalled by Simmons Prepared Foods over fears that they could be “<a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/recalls-and-public-health-alerts/recall-case-archive/archive/2019/recall-108-2019-release">contaminated with extraneous materials</a>, specifically metal,” according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).</p>
      <p>There were 2,071,397 pounds of poultry products involved in <a href="https://www.delish.com/food-news/a27687241/perdue-foods-ready-to-eat-chicken-recall/">this recall</a>, all produced between October 21, 2019 through November 4, 2019. The items recalled include things like ready-to-cook-chicken wings, legs, tenderloins, and more. Products involved in the recall have the labels “P-1949,” “P- 486,” or “P-5837” on their USDA mark of inspection. You can find a full list of <a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/wcm/connect/ec9b4d48-dfb1-4220-8364-7aa19730074c/108-2019-labels.pdf?MOD=AJPERES">labels involved in the recall here</a>.</p>

      <p>The products were shipped to stores in Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Georgia, Minnesota, Oklahoma, and Pennsylvania. No injuries or illnesses have been reported as a result of ingesting these products, but if you are concerned, the USDA recommends that you visit a healthcare professional.</p>
      <p>“Food safety is a very serious matter at Simmons,” the company <a href="https://simmonsfoods.com/company-news/2019/11/6/voluntary-recall-of-simmons-chicken-products">said in a statement</a>. “That is why Simmons has issued a precautionary and voluntary recall of approximately 2 million pounds of fresh and frozen chicken products due to the potential to contain extraneous material, specifically metal. We are working closely with regulatory authorities and affected customers to expedite this product recall.”</p>
      <p>This was designated as a Class I <a href="https://www.delish.com/food-news/a27366922/tyson-expands-frozen-chicken-strip-recall-metal/">recall</a>, meaning “this is a health hazard situation where there is a reasonable probability that the use of the product will cause serious, adverse health consequences or death,” according to the USDA. If you find any of these products in your freezer, you should dispose of them immediately or take them back to their place of purchase.</p>
