      <h1>Crypto and Blockchain Jobs Have Increased By 26% Since 2018: Research</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T15:10:19+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 15:10</time> by <a rel="author">William Foxley</a></address>
      <p>Those seeking employment in the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry have reason to be positive, says employment search company Indeed.</p>
      <p>The number of bitcoin, blockchain and crypto-related employment ads in shares per million on the popular job listing site rose by 26 percent from 2018–2019, following a four-year trend of 1,457 percent growth in the sector, according to a “Seen by Indeed” <a href="https://www.beseen.com/blog/talent/bitcoin-job-market-2019-beyond/">study</a> released Thursday.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, sector-specific job searches dropped 53 percent over the same period, following a longer downward trend, the firm found. Enthusiasm among job hunters peaked during the height of the crypto bull market in late 2017, which saw <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/">bitcoin’s price</a> reach an all-time high of around $20,000, but has gradually tailed off ever since.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Zooming into the detail, this year’s top five sector jobs being posted by employers all revolve around computer work, with software engineering, software architect, full-stack developer and front-end developer being the most common positions.</p>
      <p>The top 5 employers listing blockchain jobs are Deloitte, IBM, Accenture, Cisco and Collins Aerospace, coming in 1st through 5th, respectively. “Big Four” firm <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/?s=ernst+%26+young">Ernst &amp; Young</a> joins <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/?s=deloitte">Deloitte</a> in the top 10.</p>
      <p>Cryptocurrency and blockchain industry firms Coinbase (7th place), Overstock.com (8th) – which has as subsidiaries blockchain accelerator Medici Ventures and security token platform tZERO – Ripple (9th), Circle (11th), Kraken (12th) and ConsenSys (13th) all make the list. Banks <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/?s=JPMorgan">JPMorgan Chase</a>, which is developing its own stablecoin, and crypto-company-friendly Signature Bank tail in at 14th and 15th.</p>
      <p>Intriguingly, telecoms giant Verizon comes in in 10th place according to Indeed, the sole mobile company to make the rankings. While the firm has made <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/verizon-jetblue-blockchain-filament-funding">blockchain investments</a> and applied for a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/verizon-just-won-a-patent-to-create-virtual-sims-on-a-blockchain">patent</a> related to the tech. it’s not made any major announcements in the space.</p>
      <p>Indeed says it expects the number of jobs on offer to continue trending up through 2020, “even in the face of extreme price volatility and regulatory uncertainty of cryptocurrency.”</p>
