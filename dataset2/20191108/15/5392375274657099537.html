      <p>Chinese phone maker Ulefone’s annual <a href="http://www.gizchina.com/tag/rugged">rugged</a> flagship Armor 7 has been a hit in the market since its launch, and many fans are curious about its durability as it announced that it has passed IP68, IP69K and MIL-STD-810G certification. So, Ulefone has carried out couple of tests on the Ulefone Armor 7 to evaluate its durability. Let’s check out how it performs.</p>
      <p>As you can see in the video, no matter the guy from Ulefone threw it down the steps, fell it onto the rocks, or dropped it from more than 2 meters’ height onto the concrete floor, the phone body and screen are totally intact and the phone also works normally. And they even threw the phone into a puddle and sand, but the phone is still in perfect condition. So, besides drop-resistant, it’s also protected against water and dust. These crucial and harsh tortures push the limits of the certifications of Armor 7 to the maximum. </p>
