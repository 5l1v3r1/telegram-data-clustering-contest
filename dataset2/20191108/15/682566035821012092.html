      <p>London -<b> </b><b>Rafael Nadal </b>is facing a race against time to be ready for the <b>ATP Finals</b> as he battles Novak Djokovic for the year-end number one ranking, admitting he is struggling with his serve.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old said he was happy to be in London after being forced to pull out of last week's Paris Masters at the semi-final stage with an abdominal strain, but admitted he was not serving at full tilt ahead of his opening match against defending champion Alexander Zverev.</p>
      <p>"I need to see how things evolve every single day," he said. "I have good hopes to be 100 percent ready for Monday."</p>
      <p>Nadal is bidding to clinch the year-end number one spot in the ATP rankings for a fifth time - he is currently 640 points ahead of Djokovic ahead of the season-ending tournament in London, starting on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard, who has never won the ATP Finals despite his trophy-laden career, dethroned Djokovic from the top of the rankings this week.</p>
      <p>He has often struggled with injuries towards the end of the season - missing the ATP Finals last year through injury and pulling out after just one match in 2017.</p>
      <p>The top seed said he had only started practising his serving on Thursday and it had been "very slow".</p>
      <p>"I don't want to lie to you," he said. "I have confidence that it can go well but I also have the doubt that it can go badly because the time from what happened in Paris until today is very short.</p>
      <p>"I'm not feeling uncomfortable because I haven't really served. I've only served very slowly. With my training so far I don't have any kind of problem, I feel perfect, I don't have any kind of pain."</p>
      <p>Nadal, who won the French Open and US Open this year, said he had been happy with his form before his injury.</p>
      <p>"I'm confident that I can be very competitive but of course it's a tournament that you will face the top guys from the beginning so you need to be 100 percent ready," he said.</p>
      <p>"I really hope that I will be able to serve every single day better."</p>
      <p>Nadal's opponents in the Andre Agassi group are Daniil Medvedev, Stefanos Tsitsipas and Zverev.</p>
      <p>The Bjorn Bjorg group features Djokovic, Roger Federer, Dominic Thiem and Matteo Berrettini.</p>
      <p>Djokovic, who won the Australian Open and Wimbledon this season, must reach the final in London to have any chance of overtaking Nadal at the top of the rankings.</p>
      <p>The Serbian, who can claim a record-equalling sixth year-end number one finish, said he was hungry to finish the year on top.</p>
      <p>"One of the two biggest achievements that you can have as a professional competitive tennis player - winning a Grand Slam and being number one in the world at the end of the season," he said.</p>
      <p>"At this stage of my career in terms of goals and achievements obviously that's right at the top. In order for me to be in the position to be year-end number one I understand I have to be healthy and schedule well."</p>
      <p>The ATP Finals, featuring the year's best eight players, is contested in a round-robin format with the best four players and doubles teams reaching the knockout semi-finals stage.</p>
