      <h2>The Chilean goalkeeper has not played in the Premier League for 18 months but is set to deputise for City's regular no.1 who has been ruled out through injury</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T15:16:09+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 15:16</time> by <a rel="author">David McDonnell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-mcdonnell/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/pep-guardiola">Pep Guardiola</a> says he trusts calamity keeper Claudio Bravo for the biggest game of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City's</a> season.</p>
      <p>Rusty Bravo has not played a Premier League game for 18 months, but will be between the posts for Sunday's title showdown at rivals <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> , after <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/breaking-ederson-out-liverpool-vs-20841377">Ederson was ruled out</a> .</p>
      <p>But Guardiola says he has complete faith in Bravo - sent off in the Champions League in midweek after Ederson came off injured – and claimed the 36-year-old deserves more respect.</p>
      <p>“Ederson’s not able to play Sunday,” said Guardiola. “I don’t know [how long he will be out for]. But Sunday he cannot play.</p>
      <p>“But we have another top keeper. Claudio can do it too, of course.</p>

      <p>“We won the Carabao Cup and the last FA Cup thanks to Claudio, so he’s an exceptional keeper.</p>
      <p>“He's won a lot of games with his national team, Chile. So no doubts.</p>
      <p>“Why should I not be confident with my players on my team?</p>
      <p>“Why would I have doubts because a player who does not play regularly does not play?</p>

      <p>“I’ve seen him in training and I know how fired up and how good he is – we're not going to lose because of Claudio.</p>
      <p>“You have to respect this guy. He’s played at an incredible level, he won the Copa America, other cups, respect that guy, he's an incredible, top, top keeper.</p>
      <p>“So why should I not have any confidence with one player in my team? He wouldn’t be here.”</p>

      <p>Liverpool can open up a nine-point lead over City should they collect all three points in the mammoth clash.</p>
      <p>And Reds boss Jurgen Klopp has called on everyone inside the stadium to be on their best form.</p>
      <p>“We have to play our best game, everybody in the stadium has to be in absolutely top shape," he said. "The guy who sells the hot dogs has to be in the top shape!</p>
      <p>“Everybody has to be from the first second, come early into the stadium, come inside, nothing to do outside, wait for the team warming up, be there, be ready. That's what I wish for.”</p>
