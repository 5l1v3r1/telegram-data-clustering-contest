      <p>LOS ANGELES – Artist and designer Kanye West has thrown out a new name idea and, honestly, it's hard to tell if he's joking.</p>
      <p>In a surprise appearance at the 2019 Fast Company Innovation Festival, West suggested that he may legally change his name to "Christian Genius Billionaire Kanye West" for a little bit.</p>
      <p>"When people say it's crass to call yourself a billionaire, I might legally change my name to Christian Genius Billionaire Kanye West for a year until y'all understand exactly what it is," he told Fast Company senior writer Mark Wilson.</p>
      <p>"That's going to be so hard to type," Wilson joked.</p>
      <p>"It will be on the license plate," West pitched in.</p>
      <p>West's erratic interview style often results in head-turning lines like this one.</p>
      <p>Last year, he stirred up controversy by suggesting slavery <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/01/entertainment/kanye-west-slavery-choice-trnd/index.html">was a choice</a> .</p>
      <p>In 2016, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/kanye-west-begs-mark-zuckerberg-for-1-billion-on-twitter/">he asked Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg for $1 billion</a> , saying he was $53 million in debt.</p>
      <p>In 2009, West -- to promote a sneaker line -- said he'd change his name to <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/kanye-west-732-1316047">Martin Louis the King Jr</a> .</p>
      <p>And in 2006, he posed for Rolling Stone with a crown of thorns and compared himself to Jesus.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The name change was part of a larger discussion</b>
      </p>
      <p>Just moments before the proposed name change, West was discussing how he has bounced back from the aftermath of 2016, a difficult year for him, and is approaching the brand with innovative and environmentally-conscious solutions.</p>
      <p>West seemed to unravel in the fall of 2016, shortly after <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/08/entertainment/kanye-west-yeezy-fashion-show/index.html">the launch</a> of his fashion line "Yeezy Season 4." Within a month of the launch, his wife Kim Kardashian West was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/10/03/entertainment/kardashian-west-robbery-what-we-know/index.html">robbed at gunpoint</a> in Paris. By November, West was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/11/21/entertainment/kanye-west-hospitalized/index.html">hospitalized for exhaustion</a> hours after canceling his 2016 tour.</p>
      <p>Now, West has leaped headfirst into a series of endeavors, including his latest album release, "Jesus is King" and a series of changes occurring in his design company Yeezy.</p>
      <p>During the interview, West discussed his recent decision to move the Yeezy headquarters to Cody, Wyoming. The company's new 4,000-acre ranch in the US will allow the brand to test "seed-to-sew" methods of growing their own materials, West says.</p>
