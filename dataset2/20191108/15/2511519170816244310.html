      <p>Mothercare has kicked off a closing down sale in a bid to shift products from its warehouses as 79 stores around the UK close their doors.</p>
      <p>On Monday the mother and baby retailer<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/mothercare-close-uk-stores-jobs-loss-administration-a9187546.html"> appointed administrators</a> after a long period of declining sales – partly due to online competition – and failing to secure further investment. </p>
      <p>The sale, which confirmed that the UK website will also be shut down, is offering customers discounts of up to 60 per cent on branded and own-brand items.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Mothercare said: “This is a great opportunity for customers to pick up some amazing deals as everything is reduced. Demand will be high so don’t wait to grab a fantastic deal, especially if you’re Christmas shopping.”</p>
      <p>Parents can currently find dramatically reduced discounts such as the <a href="http://go.redirectingat.com/?id=44681X1458326&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mothercare.com%2Fcar-seats%2Fmothercare-milan-highback-booster-car-seat---black%2F214572.html%3Fcgid%3Dsale_car_Seats%23start%3D2&amp;sref=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/mothercare-closing-down-sale-prices-administration-latest-a9194766.html">Mothercare Milan highback booster car seat</a> (was £50, now £30) or the <a href="http://go.redirectingat.com/?id=44681X1458326&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mothercare.com%2Fpushchairs%2Fmothercare-genie-pushchair%2F987069.html%3Fcgid%3Dsale_pushchairs%23start%3D1&amp;sref=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/mothercare-closing-down-sale-prices-administration-latest-a9194766.html">Mothercare Genie pushchair</a> (was £380, now £249).</p>
      <p>But customers will have to be quick as lots of items are already sold out and stocks will not be replenished. </p>
      <p>The sale does not include milk, food or medicines, according to a disclaimer on the website, but does promise further discounts in the coming days.</p>
      <p>Customers have also been told that the brand is no longer accepting refunds on items already purchased, and gift cards will not be valid, but product warranties will remain applicable. </p>
      <p>The closure of Mothercare will see the loss of more than 2,800 jobs, a number which could increase further as call centre and warehouse employees, hired by a third party, have not yet been told whether their jobs will be affected.</p>
      <p>Mothercare’s international arm will continue to run with 1,000 stores in 40 countries around the world. Only 50 staff in head office will remain to oversee this part of the business. </p>
      <p>The company, which opened in 1961, has been under pressure for years as families looking for budget options relied on supermarket brands and online retailers such as Amazon. </p>
