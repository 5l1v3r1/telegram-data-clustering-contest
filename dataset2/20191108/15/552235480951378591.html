      <h1>Hearts announce fly-on-the-wall documentary series that will take fans 'Inside Tynecastle'</h1>
      <h2>There's been plenty of drama already this season with the Jambos managerless and facing a relegation battle.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T15:47:49+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 15:47</time> by <a rel="author">Graeme Young, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/graeme-young/</a></address>
      <p>Hearts have announced they will feature in a new behind the scenes documentary following the club during the 2019/20 season.</p>
      <p>BBC Scotland will air the show, which is already in development, following the conclusion of the club's <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-premiership">Premiership</a> campaign.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a> are following in the footsteps of the likes of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> and Juventus who have allowed cameras inside the sanctum of the dressing room.</p>
      <p>But the Jambos will be hoping there's more to cheer than "Sunderland 'Til I Die", which charted the Black Cats' fall from the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/english-premier-league">Premier League</a> to League One.</p>

      <p>There will be plenty that pique interest from producers with the Jambos managerless after <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/craig-levein-questions-b-hearts-20468663">Craig Levein</a> 's exit and ahead of bottom side St Mirren on goal difference.</p>
      <p>The club revealed the cameras have already been rolling in recent weeks and the cameras were on ahead of their recent home clash with Rangers.</p>
      <p>They said: "Heart of Midlothian Football Club will be the subject of a brand-new ‘behind the scenes’ documentary ‘Inside Tynecastle’, currently in development with production company Two Rivers Media and BBC Scotland.</p>

      <p>"Eagle-eyed fans may have already spotted television crews shadowing members of Hearts’ staff during the recent home match against Rangers at Tynecastle, with filming across several areas of the club already under way.</p>
      <p>"'Inside Tynecastle’ will chronicle the 2019/20 season at Hearts.  The focus is not just on what happens on the pitch but on the supporters and inner workings of the club in all areas and at all levels.  The series will let viewers better understand the complexities and challenges involved in running an SPFL club.</p>
      <p>"Filming will continue throughout the season with an on-air date to be announced post the season closing."</p>
