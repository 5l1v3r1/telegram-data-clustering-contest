      <p>A new Director of Governance has been appointed by Wolverhampton City Council, its leader announced last night (Wednesday) - occupying a Â£140,000 post that has been vacant since early this year.</p>
      <p>Councilor Ian Brookfield (Lab. Fallings Park), told a meeting of the full council that successful candidate David Pattison will also serve as Solicitor to the Council and Monitoring Office when he takes up his new role.</p>
      <p>"This is something that we've been looking for, as this position needs to be filled. We were fortunate enough only just on Tuesday to have had a final set of interviews, so I'd like to thank everyone who took part in those," he said.</p>

      <p>"We are immensely pleased that we think we have found the best candidate for the job. Mr Pattison comes to us from South Staffordshire, where he held a similar post.</p>
      <p>"He's energetic, with plenty of ideas and he'll be a great collaborator who will work with everyone across all our corporate priorities.</p>
      <p>"We did have two very strong candidates in the end, but Mr Pattison was just another step above," he added.</p>
      <p>Leader of the opposition, Cllr Wendy Thompson (Con. Tettenhall Wightwick) said: "I'm very happy to second the resolution for the appointment of the Director of Governance, as all the candidates went through a very rigorous process."</p>
