      <h1>Assessment improves cancer care of older adults</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T15:40:56+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 15:40</time> by <a rel="author">Leslie Orr-Rochester</a></address>
      <p>When physicians fully appreciate the concerns older adults with cancer have, such as function and forgetfulness, it elevates patient care and satisfaction, according to a new study.</p>
      <p>Researchers believe the study is the first to assess in a randomized clinical trial whether a tool known as geriatric assessment (GA) can meaningfully influence cancer care for vulnerable older people.</p>
      <p>Many oncologists in community practices are not aware of, or don’t ask patients who are 70 or older, about living conditions, functional ability, cognition, and family support, for example.</p>
      <p>But these kinds of impairments link to chemotherapy toxicity, an inability to complete treatment, and an overall decline in health or risk of <a href="https://www.futurity.org/protein-rich-diet-may-unhealthy-smoking/">early death</a>, says Supriya Mohile, professor of hematology/oncology at the University of Rochester Medical Center and corresponding author of the paper in <i><a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoncol.2019.4728">JAMA Oncology</a></i>.</p>
      <p>A geriatric assessment can personalize care and prompt <a href="https://www.futurity.org/cancer-care-communication-2117982/">better conversations</a> among physicians, patients, and their families, the study shows.</p>
      <p>“We’ve shown that we can modify the behavior of oncologists if they have the right tools and guidance,” says Mohile, who also co-leads the Cancer Survivorship and Supportive Care research program at Wilmot Cancer Center.</p>
      <p>“And when oncologists are better informed about the special needs of their older adult patients, everyone’s experience is much improved.”</p>
      <p>Health professionals should consider a GA summary standard care for older adults with cancer, and use appropriate interventions based on the report as needed, researchers say.</p>
      <p>A case might look like this: Jane Doe recently fell at home, which a geriatric assessment revealed. Evidence shows that falls increase the risk of chemotherapy side effects, and therefore the physician talks to Jane and Jane’s <a href="https://www.futurity.org/primary-care-value-1972942-2/">primary caregiver</a> about those risks and recommends physical therapy to prevent additional falls.</p>
      <p>The study involved 541 older people with advanced cancer receiving treatment at 31 oncology clinics across the US, through the university’s National Cancer Institute Community Oncology Research Program.</p>
      <p>The oncology practices either received a tailored GA assessment and summary with recommendations for the patient, or the usual alerts related to depression or cognitive impairment. Then, researchers measured patient and caregiver <a href="https://www.futurity.org/health-care-team-training-1702052/">satisfaction</a> with questionnaires and through audio recordings of physician visits.</p>
      <p>The Patient-Center Outcomes Research Institute, the National cancer Institute, and the National Institute of Aging funded the work.</p>
