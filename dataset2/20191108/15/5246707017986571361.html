      <p>Fresh off the production line from Little Chicken Game Company, <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rekt_high_octane_stunts">REKT! High Octane Stunts</a></b> is spinning to Switch eShop today. If the trailer above is anything to go by, it combines the floaty, spin-heavy physics of <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rocket_league">Rocket League</a></b> with a neon skate park style and couch co-op gameplay that looks like it could be worth taking for a spin.</p>
      <p>Advertised as running at a 'smooth 60 frames per second', it turns <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/tony_hawks_pro_skater_3">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a></b> into a RC racing game as you pull off stunts and kickflip your car while building up combos. With a whole bunch of modes, from old-school High Score to Capture the Crown and another where you have to infect other players with a virus (appropriately called 'Virus' mode), it seems the game has plenty to keep you and up to three other players occupied.</p>
      <p>Here are a few of the standout features according to the game's official blurb:</p>
      <blockquote>- Stunts, lots of 'em!<br/>- Three main arenas to do stunts in<br/>- Time-limited High Score mode with global leaderboard<br/>- Practice mode to test skills and learn new tricks<br/>- Over fifty customizable cars to unlock<br/>- An almost endless amount of challenges<br/>- Up to four players in different multiplayer modes: Score, Virus, Baja, Capture the Crown.</blockquote>

      <p>Available today, a 50%-off launch sale brings it down to $2.99 / £2.69 on the Switch eShop until December. For that sort of investment, it could be worth a look if you and three friends are in the mood for some couch co-op fun over the weekend. Only time will tell if it's got what it takes to make it on to our <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/feature_best_nintendo_switch_couch_co-op_games">best couch co-op Switch games</a> list, but the trailer looks promising.</p>
