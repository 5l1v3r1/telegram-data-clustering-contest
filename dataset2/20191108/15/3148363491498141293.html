      <h1>Debra Messing Blasts 'The View' for Hosting Don Jr: 'His Family Assaulted Our Country'</h1>
      <h2>Actress and left-wing activist Debra Messing slammed the ABC political talk show The View over their decision to host Donald Trump Jr., describing the decision as “irresponsible” and “very, very disappointing.”</h2>

      <p>Trump Jr. appeared on the show alongside Kimberly Guilfoyle on Thursday, where he was supposed to discuss his new book <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Triggered-Left-Thrives-Wants-Silence/dp/154608603X">Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us</a>.</i></p>
      <p>However, the president’s eldest son ended up answering an array of hostile questions relating to his father’s presidency and his supposed outing of the whistleblower who is believed to have started the House Intelligence Committee’s impeachment inquiry.</p>

      <p>“Why would you bring him on? You trying to be ‘balanced?’ He and his family have assaulted our country, our democracy, our environment, our national security, moral compass,” Debra Messing complained. “Very very disappointing and irresponsible decision [in my opinion].”</p>

      <p>It is not the first time that Messing has attacked the Trump family and ended up feuding with <i>The View. </i>In August, the <i>Will &amp; Grace </i>star <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/08/31/debra-messing-calls-for-doxxing-trump-hollywood-fundraiser-attendees/">called</a> for a public blacklist of Hollywood attendees to President Trump’s campaign fundraiser in September.</p>
      <p>Her demand was later <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2019/09/03/whoopi-slams-debra-messing-for-targeting-trump-donors-dont-encourage-lists-you-could-be-on-the-next-one/">criticized</a> by <i>The View </i>co-host Whoopi Goldberg, who compared it to McCarthy era Hollywood blacklists. “The last time people did this, people ended up killing themselves,” Goldberg warned Messing at the time. “This is not a good idea, OK?”</p>
      <p>Just days after her call, Messing came under fire again for endorsing a racist sign put up by a Baptist church in Alabama describing Trump black supporters as “mentally ill.” She later <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/09/03/debra-messing-deletes-racist-black-trump-voters-are-mentally-ill-tweet/">deleted</a> the tweet, apologizing for “recklessly supporting” the racist message, but insisted that the GOP targets black people for “voter suppression.”</p>
