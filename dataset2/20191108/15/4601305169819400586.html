      <p>Rapper and noted idiot Lil Pump was shooting a music video on Thursday night, with, for no good reason, a live snake. Snakes aren't props. They're living creatures.</p>
      <p>TMZ (I know, I know) reports that the attack “left him a bloody mess.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/08/lil-pump-snake-bite-bloodied-filming-music-video/">From TMZ</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>The rapper was shooting a music video Thursday night and the crew was handing off a snake to Lil Pump, who was sitting on some sort of stair-like throne. Then, it happened. <br/><br/>The snake, out of nowhere, whipped around and sunk its fangs into Pump's left hand. The scary moment was captured by podcast host Adam Grandmaison -- aka Adam22. You can see Pump flail as he extricates himself from the reptile. He then shows off the gnarly injury.<br/><br/>LP's left hand is covered in blood. And, if you look closely near the end of the vid ... it appears as if the snake's setting its sights on a second victim.<br/><br/>Good news for Lil Pump ... he doesn't seem that hurt, saying, "I just got bit by a snake WTF." He threw in a snake emoji on the caption and a few laughing ones before adding, "I can't f**k [with] no snakes. I hope I don't die."</blockquote>
