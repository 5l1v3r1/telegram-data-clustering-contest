      <h1>Tesla's 'Cybertruck' Pickup Is Coming This Month</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T15:28:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 15:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/" target="_blank">Mack Hogan</a></address>

      <p>Tesla is set to reveal its new pickup truck later this month, according to a tweet from CEO Elon Musk. The truck, which Musk has taken to referring to as a "Cybertruck," is <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/380758/tesla-pickup-truck-military/">expected to look</a> substantially different from current trucks from so-called "legacy automakers," as Tesla fans might argue.</p>
      <p>The debut is scheduled for Nov. 21, the last day of the press preview of the Los Angeles Auto Show. It won't happen at the show itself, though. Instead, Tesla will unveil the truck at a facility near the SpaceX rocket facility in Los Angeles.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/07/elon-musk-teslas-pickup-will-be-a-better-truck-than-ford-f-150.html">Musk has previously claimed </a>that the truck will hopefully start at less than $50,000 and be "a better truck than an F-150 in terms of truck-like functionality, and be a better sports car than a standard [Porsche] 911.‚Äù He also claimed that they were targeting a<a href="https://insideevs.com/news/377530/tesla-pickup-truck-reveal-november/"> 300,000-pound towing</a> capacity.</p>

      <p>We're skeptical of those claims. The truck may be able to technically move 300,000 pounds in ideal conditions, but it's essentially impossible for a standard pickup truck to get a figure like that in the Society of Automotive Engineers' max towing standard test. The Ford F-150, for reference, tows 13,200 pounds in that test. And no matter how quick it is, it's extremely unlikely that Tesla's pickup will be a better sports car than the 911.</p>
      <p>Of course, we'll have to wait and see what Musk has in store. Hopefully, we'll get some more of that information on Nov. 21.</p>
