      <p>Kaizer Chiefs are expected to welcome back several players against Orlando Pirates, but this Soweto Derby comes too soon for some of their stars...</p>
      <p>
        <b>Check out all Chiefs' latest injury news in the gallery above!</b>
      </p>
      <p>It was a completely different Amakhosi XI that went into battle against Chippa United earlier in the week to the one that knocked the Buccaneers out of the Telkom Knockout a week ago, but things should look a bit more familiar come tomorrow afternoon. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Read: <a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/local/categories/kaizer-chiefs/kaizer-chiefs-are-enjoying-the-view-in-the-absa-premiership/667041">Chiefs’ Table-Topping Coach - I Don’t Look At The Log…</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>Ernst Middendorp confirmed that star trio of Khama Billiat, Lebogang Manyama and Erick Mathoho all required extra rest after instructions from his medical team, but they are all now expected back in action for the Soweto Derby at FNB Stadium tomorrow afternoon. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Kearyn Baccus (who has been nursing ankle and knee knocks) is back in contention for a place in the squad tomorrow, as is Reeve Frosler after the full back was forced off with a hamstring problem in the first half of the 2-0 win over Mamelodi Sundowns. </p>
      <p>It is thought though, that this game comes a little bit too early for club captain, Itumeleng Khune, as he looks to get back from a groin problem, and the same goes for young Nkosingiphile Ngcobo as he gets some minutes in in the MultiChoice Diski Challenge following surgery on his Achilles.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Middendorp may have a tough decision to make when selecting his squad to face Pirates after Dumsani Zuma, a player who has spent most of his season on the bench, bagged a brace against Chippa and put himself in contention for a starting berth. </p>
