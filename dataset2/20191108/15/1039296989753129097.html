      <h1>Production-ready Jawa Perak unveil on November 15, sees price revision</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T15:48:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 15:48</time> by <a rel="author">Vishal Venugopal</a></address>
      <p>The Jawa Perak will likely see an increase in its initially announced Rs 1.89 lakh price tag.</p>
      <p>Jawa made its iconic return to the Indian market last year with three new models – the Jawa, the Jawa Forty Two and the Jawa Perak. The Jawa and Forty Two have been on sale since and you can read about them <b><a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/bike-reviews/2018-jawa-jawa-forty-two-review-test-ride-410790">here</a></b>. The bobber-styled Perak, meanwhile, was set to go on sale sometime this year, and now we have a date for the official launch – November 15. We’ve also been told that it will come featuring a revised price tag, and not the Rs 1.89 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi) price it was first showcased with. Could this be due to an upgrade to a BS6-compliant engine? We’ll know soon enough.</p>
      <p>The Perak is unlike the other two retro-styled motorcycles in the current Jawa line-up. It's got a low-slung, long stance with handsome bobber styling cues. The bike was showcased in a matte black colour scheme, but we can see Jawa offering a few more shades. It also ditched all the chrome for a matte black treatment. The Perak was showcased was a single-seater with styling elements like a floating seat, bar-end mirrors, chopped fenders, and stubby exhaust mufflers. How much of this will make it to the production model, or be made available as additional extras, remains to be seen, but it’s likely the production-ready bike will feature a slightly more conventional design.</p>
      <p>When it was first showcased, Jawa also revealed that the Perak will use a slightly larger version of the engine on the Jawa and Forty Two, namely a 334cc, single-cylinder, liquid-cooled, DOHC engine which back then, developed 30hp and 31Nm of torque. It uses a bigger bore with the same stroke. In comparison, the Jawa and Jawa Forty Two make 27hp and 28Nm of torque. The Perak also has a different subframe and suspension setup at the rear. </p>
      <p>It’ll be interesting to see how Jawa goes about with the booking and delivery procedure of the Jawa Perak, considering the impressive demand for the Jawa and Forty Two.</p>
