      <h1>Newcastle United v Bournemouth: match preview</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T15:14:57+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 15:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/08/Guardian%20Staff" target="_blank">Guardian Staff</a></address>
      <p>It was a 3-1 home defeat by Eddie Howe’s Bournemouth in March 2016 that marked the end of Steve McClaren’s Newcastle tenure, prefacing his replacement by Rafael Benítez. Now the man in charge is Steve Bruce who, despite years at assorted clubs, has never faced <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> as a manager. Whatever the result, Bruce is highly unlikely to be dismissed but will nonetheless be happy when the impending international break is over. “I shouldn’t say it but a lot of managers think ‘I have to get past the international breaks’,” he said. “In October and November some of us think we’ve got past that hurdle of getting the sack.” <b>Louise Taylor</b></p>
