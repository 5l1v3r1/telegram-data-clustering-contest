      <h1>The Resident Evil 2 remake is sooooo close to passing the original's lifetime sales</h1>
      <h2>Capcom's killing it</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T15:30:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 15:30</time> by <a rel="author">Brett Makedonski</a></address>
      <p>Capcom has had a pretty fantastic 2019. The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-resident-evil-2-2019--538881.phtml"><i>Resident Evil 2</i> remake</a> and <i><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-devil-may-cry-5-544271.phtml">Devil May Cry 5</a></i> are both game of the year contenders. <i>Monster Hunter: World</i> got an excellent expansion in <i><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-monster-hunter-world-iceborne-563003.phtml">Iceborne</a></i>. Even <i><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../teppen-is-like-hearthstone-meets-magic-the-gathering-with-capcom-characters-559790.phtml">Teppen</a></i>, a free-to-play CCG with heroes across Capcom's many properties, is an up-and-comer that's decently popular.</p>
      <p>As part of its new financial report, Capcom has quantified these successes. Leading the way is <i>Resident Evil 2</i> remake which now sits at 4.7 million sales. That's right on the heels of the original <i>Resident Evil 2</i> which has plateaued at 4.96 million sales. The remake is still trending in the right direction after it got out to a hot start and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../resident-evil-2-is-off-to-a-fantastic-start-as-capcom-reports-3-million-units-shipped-540714.phtml">shipped three million copies</a> in the first four days. With Black Friday and end-of-the-year sales coming up, it's a safe bet that the remake will dethrone the original by the time of the next report.</p>
      <p>Also noteworthy is <i>Iceborne</i> weighing in at 2.8 million sales in less than a month. (<i>Iceborne </i>released in early September and these rankings cut off at the end of September.) Success is inevitable considering that <i>Monster Hunter: World</i> is Capcom's best-selling game ever by a large margin, coming in at 14.1 million sales.</p>
      <p>Of 2019's heavy hitters, <i>Devil May Cry 5</i> fared the worst with 2.7 million sales to date -- although that's still impressive. These rankings also introduce three other members into Capcom's prestigious platinum club. <i>Mega Man 11</i>, <i>Okami HD</i>, and <i>Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection</i> all broke the one million lifetime sales barrier.</p>
