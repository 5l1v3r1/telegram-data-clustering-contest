      <p>MADRID, Nov 8 ― Spain have recalled Alvaro Morata for their Euro 2020 qualifiers against Malta and Romania after the striker scored five times in his last five games for Atletico Madrid.</p>
      <p>Spain, who have already qualified for next year's championship, need to avoid defeat in one of their two remaining games in order to progress as Group F winners.</p>
      <p>There was a maiden call up for Dani Olmo, however Barcelona's Ansu Fati and Arsenal's Dani Ceballos missed out.</p>
      <p>Zagreb forward Olmo, who was a key part of the Spain Under-21 side that won this year’s European Championship, has impressed for the Croatian side in the Champions League this season.</p>
      <p>The squad contains just five players from Spain’s so-called “big three” sides ― Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid and Barcelona.</p>
      <p>Manchester City midfielder Rodri, who has not played since October 22 due to a hamstring problem, is included while Barcelona’s Jordi Alba misses out through injury.</p>
      <p>There is also no place for Barca team mate Fati.</p>
      <p>The 17-year-old forward was granted Spanish citizenship in September before making his Under-21 debut last month. He is expected to be named by Luis de la Fuente in the U-21 squad later today.</p>
      <p>Spain host Malta on November 15 and Romania three days later.</p>
