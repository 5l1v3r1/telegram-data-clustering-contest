      <p>Already preparing your festive TV schedule? Then you'll need to add one more to the list, as the long-awaited <i>Bourne </i>spin-off series, <i>Treadstone</i>, will be making its way overseas in January. If you're wondering <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/who-plays-bentley-on-treadstone-jeremy-irvine-trained-hard-for-the-part-19220150">how to watch <i>Treadstone </i>in the UK</a>, here's everything you need to know.</p>
      <p>The 10-part USA Network series first aired in the U.S. in October. Exploring the origins and updates of Operation Treadstone —<b> </b>the covert CIA operation that turned regular people into mega killers —<b> </b>the series doesn't feature long-time <i>Bourne </i>star Matt Damon. But it does star <a href="https://www.usanetwork.com/treadstone/cast">a few familiar faces</a>.</p>
      <p>Jeremy Irvine, star of <i>War Horse </i>and, of course, <i>Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again</i>, plays CIA agent John Randolph Bentley. Brian J. Smith, <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/who-is-brian-j-smith-world-on-fires-webster-feels-a-real-connection-with-his-character-18809491">star of recent BBC One drama</a> <i>World on Fire</i>, appears as oil rig worker Doug McKenna who turns out be a sleeper agent. Then there's the likes of South Korean talent Hyo-Joo Han playing a North Korean mother and fellow sleeper agent, SoYun Pak. And British actor Tracy Ifeachor stars as Tara Coleman: a "disgraced" journalist who investigates an international conspiracy.</p>
      <p>All this talk of sleeper agents suddenly awakening to carry out the missions they were trained for has definitely got me in the mood for a <i>Treadstone </i>marathon. If you feel the same way, you can <a href="https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a29448925/bourne-spin-off-treadstone-broadcaster-amazon-prime/">catch the series on Amazon Prime</a> from Jan. 10, per Digital Spy.</p>
      <p>TV Promos on YouTube</p>
      <p>Yes, it's almost a three-month wait since the U.S. broadcast, but it's the price us Brits sometimes have to pay for high-stakes television. Until then, try to avoid the spoilers currently plastered all over the internet.</p>
      <p>Cast interviews have revealed further tantalising details. Speaking to Collider, Irvine explained how <i>Treadstone </i>lays out numerous timelines from across the globe before going deep into a few. He also said he <a href="https://collider.com/treadstone-jeremy-irvine-interview/">spent two months learning martial arts</a>, which makes sense because, as expected, "there's a lot of fighting." When asked about a potential second season, the 29-year-old admitted his guess was as good as yours, saying the show bosses are "very secretive."</p>
      <p>Executive producer Ben Smith delved into the crossover between the films, the series, and the books. (<i>Bourne </i>is based on novels by Robert Ludlum.) "Within our first episode, there are references for careful viewers that they will know that they’re <a href="https://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/the-fourth-wall/283785/treadstone-ben-smith-interview">firmly within the world of Jason Bourne,</a>" he told Den of Geek.</p>
      <p>But, he added, "there are things that you won’t see in the <i><i>Treadstone</i></i> TV series, and there’s things from <i>Treadstone</i> that you probably will not see in the <i>Bourne</i> films although they are concurrent."</p>
      <p>Sounds like a <i>Bourne </i>rewatching session is in order.</p>
