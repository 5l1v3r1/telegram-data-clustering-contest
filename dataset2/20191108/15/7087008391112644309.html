      <h1>Friday Crypto Market Watch: Bitcoin Says Goodbye To $9K, Plunging $800 In 48 Hours</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T15:03:32+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 15:03</time> by <a rel="author">Jordan Lyanchev</a></address>
      <p>After a few days of sideways trading, Bitcoin made a move. The cryptocurrency lost around $800 in the last 48 hours. At the time of this writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at about $8,800.</p>
      <p>Two weeks ago, the Chinese President announced that the country should put more effort into embracing blockchain-based technology, and Bitcoin’s price skyrocketed by severe 40%. After that, however, the price retraced to around $9,300 and traded in this range for a while.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, as <i>Cryptopotato </i><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-at-short-term-risk-facing-the-critical-200-days-ma-line/">reported</a>, Bitcoin was testing the key-support of the 200-days moving average for the fifth time (in ten days). Unfortunately, this time, the support failed as Bitcoin fell below the $9,000 level, at least for now. The current low sits at $8,660.</p>

      <h3>Major Crypto Headlines</h3>
      <p><b>China Is Here: Majority Of Binance Inflows In 2019 Came From Huobi.</b> China’s interest in all things blockchain appears to have increased over the last several weeks. To further support this, a <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/china-is-here-majority-of-binance-inflows-in-2019-came-from-huobi/">recent report</a> shows that the major inflows in Binance are coming from the China-based cryptocurrency exchange, Huobi.</p>
      <p><b>Tether Denies Recent Bitcoin Whale Manipulation Study.</b> Two U.S. academics published a study recently, claiming that the 2017 parabolic price increase was manipulated by a single entity. They said that Tether was used to inflate Bitcoin’s price artificially. However, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/tether-denies-recent-bitcoin-whale-manipulation-study/">an official statement</a> from the company refuted their thesis, outlining that the report “suffers from methodological defects.”</p>
      <p><b>FBI Director: Cryptocurrency Is “Significant Issue” for Law Enforcement</b>. Christopher Way, the director of the FBI, spoke in front of the U.S. Senate Homeland Security this week, and he <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/fbi-director-cryptocurrency-is-significant-issue-for-law-enforcement">answered questions</a> regarding cryptocurrencies as well. According to him, crypto is a “significant issue” now and might become even a bigger problem in the future.
