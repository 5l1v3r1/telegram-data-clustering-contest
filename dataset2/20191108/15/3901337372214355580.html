      <p>The Absa Premiership has so far entertained us with goals galore this season and while we are hopeful of another action-packed weekend, Soccer Laduma takes a look at 10 emotional goal celebrations that have been photographed in the past weeks.</p>

      <p>While their defence has been their biggest concern this season, Cape Town City are currently the highest-scoring team with 18 goals in the league, with their on-form striker, Kermit Erasmus also top of the players’ goalscoring charts.</p>

      <p>However, the Gauteng sides are quickly catching up to the Citizens, with Kaizer Chiefs at second placed on the charts with 16 goals while SuperSport United have scored 14.</p>
      <p>At the bottom of the charts is Chippa United, who have scored just three goals all season and while the highest goal-scoring team is nowhere near the top of the league standings, the Chilli Boys are certainly right at the foot of the table with just four points.</p>
      <p>Here are the top five highest-scoring teams in the league:</p>
      <p>City – 18 goals</p>
      <p>Chiefs – 16 goals</p>
      <p>SuperSport – 14 goals</p>
      <p>Highlands Park – 13 goals</p>
      <p>Bloemfontein Celtic – 13 goals</p>
      <p>
