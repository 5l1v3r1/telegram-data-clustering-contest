      <p>With Cape Town City attacker Kermit Romeo Erasmus banging in the goals for the Mother City club this season, it can be said that the ex-Feyenoord man is one of the most in-shape stars in the PSL. Check it out!</p>
      <p>A midweek brace against Polokwane City in the Absa Premiership ensured that the mercurial forward now has eight goals in 12 games across all competitions this season.</p>
      <p>With two assists to his name too, Erasmus is not only in the form of his life but also appears to be in mint condition as far as his looking after his body is concerned.</p>

      <p>A quick glance at Erasmus' Instagram account and it's safe to say that the striker takes his fitness seriously. Soaking up the Mother City sun, Romeo is often pictured topless these days and readily shows off his ripped torso.</p>
