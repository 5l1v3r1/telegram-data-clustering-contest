      <p>Germany have announced their latest squad for their upcoming 2020 European Championship qualifiers against Belarus and Northern Ireland, and a number of the nation's most experienced players were overlooked again.</p>

      <p>Manager Joachim Low continues to impose an exile on some of the senior players who were part of his 2014 FIFA World Cup-winning squad, with the likes of Jerome Boateng, Mats Hummels and Thomas Muller being overlooked once again despite a number of other players missing through injury.  </p>
      <p>Among those who have been consigned to the sidelines through injury are Paris Saint-Germain's Julian Draxler, Juventus' Sami Khedira, Manchester City winger Leroy Sane and Bayern Munich defender Niklas Sule.</p>

      <p>Low has continued with his new-look approach to the Germany set-up, which he adopted following Die Mannschaft's failed 2018 World Cup campaign, by selecting young and relatively inexperienced players such as Robin Koch, Lukas Klostermann, Suat Serdar, Nadiem Amiri and Luca Waldschmidt.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, there will still be plenty of talent on display when Die Mannschaft are in action again, with the likes of Julian Brandt, Kai Havertz, Serge Gnabry and Timo Werner all set to feature in an exciting attacking line-up.</p>
      <p>
        <u>Here is Germany's latest squad in full, as revealed by Die Mannschaft's official Twitter account:</u>
