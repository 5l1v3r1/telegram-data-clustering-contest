      <p>ATLANTA - Winter is coming to the East Coast for the next week.</p>
      <p>The next five to seven daysgenerally are going to bring unseasonably low temperatures tothe eastern two-thirds of the US, with a first chilly round hitting Friday and a second, colder Arctic blast coming later.</p>
      <p>Friday's cold snap could bringbelow-freezing temperatures to some places.</p>
      <p>The cold was already descending early Friday on New York, with wind chill expected to make it feel like temperatures werein the upper teens to mid-20s, according to the National Weather Service. Wind gusts in Boston are reaching 25 to 35 mph and will bring wind chills into the 20s as well, the NWS said.</p>
      <p>Snow flurries are also expected Friday for downwind parts of the Great Lakes, CNN meteorologist DerekVan Damsaid, adding that those flurries will make it Saturday to the Northern Great Lakes.</p>
      <p>"The Great Lakes are no longer ice covered, so here comes the Lake Effect snow again," the National Weather Service said.</p>
      <p>Temperatures are expected to rebound a bit in the East over the weekend, but colder air will be coming.</p>
      <p>Temperatures will plummet first on Monday in the Plains, and then further east on Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>
      <h3>Cold-weather records could be broken</h3>
      <p>Starting Tuesday morning, record low temperatures are possible across Texas and Oklahoma, along with parts of the Ohio Valley.</p>
      <p>By Wednesday, more than a dozen record lows could be set in the Deep South and the Gulf Coast, CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward said.</p>
      <p>In parts of Mississippi and Alabama, highs on Wednesday aren't likely to rise out of the 30s. For those areas, that's more than 10 degrees colder than usual, even in mid-January.</p>
      <p>Some afternoon temperatures Wednesday in the East could fall up to 30 degrees below average, making it feel more like January for many.</p>
