        <b>NEW YORK, United States, Nov 8<i> – </i>Minnesota Timberwolves center Gorgui Dieng was named Friday as the first international player to win the Off-season NBA Cares Community Assist Award for humanitarian efforts in his homeland of Senegal.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Dieng’s charity foundation partners with Minnesota-based health non-profit Matter to provide long-term sustainable medical assistance to children and families in Senegal.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old T-Wolves’ big man, in his seventh NBA season all spent with Minnesota, has donated life-saving medical equipment and supplies, built demonstration farms to support sustainable agriculture and better equip farmers, ensured access to nutritious food and taught children leadership, fitness and problem-solving through basketball.</p>
      <p>“Using my platform to give back to my home country and help those in need is special for me,” Dieng said. “We have a lot of work in front of us, but I am proud of the lives we have positively impacted and humbled to know future generations will benefit from the resources we have provided.”</p>
      <p>It’s the third year the award has gone to an NBA player for off-season charity achievements.</p>
      <p>Dieng sent 300,000 bags of vital IV fluid to Senegal this summer and visited a neo-natal hospital in Diamniadio that was aided by the donation. He also hosted an agricultural conference for farmers in Kebemer and was a panelist at the NBA Africa Innovation Summit, telling the story of his journey to the NBA and becoming a businessman to inspire youth.</p>
      <p>Dieng was schooled as a sports academy in Senegal and starred at a 2009 Basketball Without Borders camp in South Africa.</p>
      <p>In July, Dieng attended the latest African Basketball without Borders camp and a forum at his former school, speaking with students and coaching some of the top young boys and girls players from across Africa.</p>
      <p>He also attended the dedication of a new court in Dakar.</p>
      <p>The league and sponsor Kaiser Permanente and the NBA will donate $10,000 to Matter on Dieng’s behalf.</p>
