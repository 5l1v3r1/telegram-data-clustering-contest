      <p><b>DES MOINES, IowaÂ (AP)</b> - The Iowa Appeals Court has ruled against a convicted killer who says he "died" during a medical emergency and thus fulfilled his life sentence.</p>
      <p>Wapello County court records say Benjamin Schreiber has been serving the life term since being convicted in 1997 of beating a man to death.</p>
      <p>Schreiber says his heart stopped five times on March 30, 2015, at a hospital where he'd been taken from the Iowa State Penitentiary in Fort Madison.</p>
      <p>Schreiber filed for release in April 2018, saying that because he momentarily died before being resuscitated at the hospital, he should be freed.</p>
      <p>A district judge found little merit in Schreiber's argument, saying Schreiber's filing confirmed that he was still among the living.</p>
      <p>The appeals court affirmed that ruling Wednesday, saying: "Schreiber is either alive, in which case he must remain in prison, or he is dead, in which case this appeal is moot."</p>
