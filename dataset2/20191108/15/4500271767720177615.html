      <p>The SAPM said that the decision was taken today in a meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Imran Khan, held to discuss ways for providing relief to masses and bringing down the prices of essential commodities.</p>
      <p>The premier took the decision after the chairman and managing director of the USC assured the government that with the injection of Rs6bn, prices of essential items will drop down significantly.</p>
      <p>Following the development, the price of 20 kilogrammes of flour will be brought down by Rs132, sugar by Rs9, rice by Rs20 and pulses by Rs15 per kg.</p>
      <p>The premier held three consecutive meetings on the issue in the last three days.</p>
      <p>Earlier on Thursday, the prime minister had asked <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1515578">top officials of the USC</a> to devise a relief package for selling five essential food items on discount across the country, according to sources.</p>
      <p>The five products will be available at 4,000 USC outlets throughout the country.</p>
      <p>The premier had already asked for establishment of a ‘Special Cell’ in the Ministry of National Food Security. The cell will take timely decisions about assessment of demand and supply of essential items.</p>
      <p>Traditionally, the government offers subsidy on essential food items in Ramazan.</p>
