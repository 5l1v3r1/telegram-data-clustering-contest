      <h1>Ayodhya land dispute: SC to deliver title-suit verdict at 10:30 am today</h1>
      <h2>The apex court is likely to pronounce judgement at 10:30 am in the morning.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T15:48:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 15:48</time> by <a rel="author">Press Trust of India</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/supreme-court">Supreme Court </a>is scheduled to pronounce its verdict in the politically sensitive case of Ram Janmbhoomi-<a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/babri-masjid">Babri Masjid </a>land dispute in <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ayodhya">Ayodhya </a>at 10:30 am on Saturday.</p>
      <p>A notice regarding the pronouncement of judgement by a Constitution Bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi was uploaded on the official website of the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/supreme-court">Supreme Court </a>late Friday evening.</p>
      <p>Other members of the bench are Justices S A Bobde, D Y Chandrachud, Ashok Bhushan and S Abdul Nazeer.</p>
      <p>The bench on October 16 had reserved the judgement after marathon hearing of 40 days.</p>
      <p>Hours before the notice, the CJI in the pre-noon held a meeting with Uttar Pradesh Chief Secretary Rajendra Kumar Tiwari and DGP Om Prakash Singh who apprised him about the security arrangements made to maintain law and order in the state.</p>
      <p>The meeting was held in the CJI's chamber, sources said.</p>
      <p>Fourteen appeals have been filed in the apex court against the 2010 Allahabad High Court judgment, delivered in four civil suits, that the 2.77-acre land in <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ayodhya">Ayodhya </a>be partitioned equally among the three parties -- the Sunni Waqf Board, the Nirmohi Akhara and Ram Lalla.</p>
      <p>Initially, as many as five lawsuits were filed in the lower court. The first one was filed by Gopal Singh Visharad, a devotee of ''Ram Lalla'', in 1950 to seek enforcement of the right to worship of Hindus at the disputed site.</p>

      <p>In the same year, the Paramahansa Ramachandra Das had also filed the lawsuit for continuation of worship and keeping the idols under the central dome of the now-demolished disputed structure.</p>
      <p>The plea was later withdrawn.</p>
      <p>Later, the Nirmohi Akahara also moved the trial court in 1959 seeking management and ''shebaiti'' (devotee) rights over the 2.77 acre disputed land.</p>
      <p>Then came the lawsuit of the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Wakf Board which moved the court in 1961, claiming title right over the disputed property.</p>
      <p>The deity, ''Ram Lalla Virajman'', through next friend and former Allahabad High Court judge Deoki Nandan Agrawal, and the Janmbhoomi (the birthplace) moved the lawsuit in 1989, seeking title right over the entire disputed property on the key ground that the land itself has the character of the deity and of a ''Juristic entity''.</p>
      <p>Later, all the lawsuits were transferred to the Allahabad High Court for adjudication following the demolition of the disputed Ram Janmbhoomi-<a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/babri-masjid">Babri Masjid </a>structure on December 6, 1992, sparking communal riots in the country.</p>
      <p>The apex court had on August 6 commenced day-to-day proceedings in the case as the mediation proceedings initiated to find the amicable resolution had failed.</p>
      <p>It had taken note of the report of the three-member panel, comprising Justice FMI Kallifulla, spiritual guru and founder of the Art of Living foundation Sri Sri Ravishankar and senior advocate and renowned mediator Sriram Panchu, that mediation proceedings, which went on for about four months, did not result in any final settlement and it had to decide the matter pending before it.</p>
