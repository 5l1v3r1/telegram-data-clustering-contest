      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T15:02:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 15:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.engadget.com/editors/christine-fisher" target="_blank">Christine Fisher</a></address>
      <p>Just days after Volkswagen <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/07/volkswagen-meb-id3-ev-factory/">showed off the first all-electric ID.3</a> produced at its Zwickau plant in Germany, the company <a href="https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/press-releases/volkswagen-starts-pre-production-in-first-plant-purely-focused-on-e-mobility-in-china-5548">announced</a> that it has entered pre-production in China, too. Like the Zwickau factory, the new plant in Anti, Shanghai, will produce all-electric vehicles on Volkswagen's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016/01/05/volkswagen-budd-e-ev/">MEB platform</a>, a modular design that's built for battery packs of varying sizes.</p>
      <p>Production at the factory, a joint venture with SAIC, is expected to start in October 2020, and it will have an annual capacity of 300,000 vehicles. FAW-Volkswagen plans to manufacture another 300,000 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/09/volkswagen-id3-unveil/">ID. model</a> vehicles in Foshan, China.</p>
      <p>Volkswageg expects to sell 22 million all-electric cars worldwide by 2028, and more than half of those sales are expected to be in China. "The country plays a crucial part in our electrification strategy, which will pave the way to Volkswagen's goal of becoming net carbon-neutral by 2050," said Dr. Herbert Diess, Chairman of the Board of Management of Volkswagen AG.</p>
