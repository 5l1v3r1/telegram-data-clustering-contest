      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T07:10:49+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 07:10</time> by <a rel="author">Vicki Newman, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/vicki-newman/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/ant-mcpartlin">Ant McPartlin</a> has discovered that his signature looks run in the family.</p>
      <p>The I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! presenter isn't the only member of his clan that's got a big forehead.</p>
      <p>He found out that his forehead - which he and best pal <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/declan-donnelly">Dec Donnelly</a> sometimes poke fun at - is in his DNA.</p>
      <p>He made the discovery as he and Dec travelled the world together to uncover their past in Ant and Dec's DNA Journey, reports the <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/">Daily Star</a> .</p>
      <p>During a visit to the Irish village of Drumkeeran in County Leitrim, Ant is told he's related to half the residents, and gets an even bigger shock when he meets up with them all in a pub.</p>

      <p>The star, 43, joked there is "definitely some resemblance".</p>
      <p>He said: "I found a lot of similarities in the look of my cousins.</p>
      <p>"Dec nicknamed the pub The Fog and Forehead because lots of people had foreheads and noses that were similar to mine."</p>
      <p>The show also sees Ant talk about making up with his estranged father, Ray.</p>

      <p>He says on camera: "My dad left the family when I was about 10 and I’ve seen him sporadically over the years.</p>
      <p>"I haven’t seen him for a long while now. We didn’t speak for quite a while… but last year we started texting each other and I spoke to him on the phone for my birthday, which was lovely.</p>
      <p>"To be fair, life is too short. There is no point holding grudges or anything like that. You get to that age… I turned 40 and I just thought let’s stop messing about, let’s get in touch because you never know what’s going to happen."</p>

      <p>Ant made the comments while the ITV documentary was being filmed at his mum’s home in Newcastle, joking “when is Dad coming?” to her and his two sisters, Emma and Sarha.</p>
      <p>Ant’s mum Christine Woodhall brought him up as a single mum after his dad left while he was still a schoolboy. Ray later remarried and father and son are thought to have resumed contact after many years in 2017.</p>
      <p>* Ant and Dec's DNA Journey airs Sunday and Monday at 9pm on ITV</p>
