      <p>KSI and Logan Paul took a back seat as their trainers almost came to blows in Hollywood.</p>
      <p>The YouTube stars came together for the penultimate time before the first bell of their rematch on Saturday.</p>
      <p>But it was former heavyweight world champion Shannon Briggs who stole the limelight.</p>
      <p>Briggs will be in Paul's corner for the sequel at the Staples Center while KSI has been trained by professional fighter Viddal Riley.</p>
      <p>And it was the coaches who traded insults across the stage.</p>
      <p>Briggs said: "This is great for boxing, it's going to introduce new boxing fans to the sport.</p>
      <p>"I had to be part of it, I've been connected to Logan for 25 years through a guy I met on the street, Paulo, who is now his manager.</p>
      <p>"This is a great opportunity but my man has the ability and I know he can be the champ because I did it twice</p>
      <p>"This is the pro ranks and you came to this fight with a butter knife of a trainer.</p>
      <p>"This is war, you're going to get beat up real bad. I said to Logan you better put this guy in hospital."</p>
