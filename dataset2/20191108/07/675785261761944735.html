      <h1>Arsenal's fear over selling Granit Xhaka in January transfer window</h1>
      <h2>Arsenal are ready to let Swiss midfielder Granit Xhaka go in January following his recent clash with suppporters</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T07:53:37+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 07:53</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal fear they may have to let Granit Xhaka go for a cut-price fee in January.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenal-set-sell-granit-xhaka-20835793">Mirror Sport reported this week</a> that the Gunners will look to sell the Swiss midfielder following his clash with supporters.</p>
      <p>Xhaka has already been stripped of the captaincy and fears he has no future at the club after the bust-up during the recent draw with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> at the Emirates.</p>
      <p>It now seems certain that he will be sold in the next transfer window with Germany the most likely destination.</p>
      <p>But the Mail reports <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> have their concerns ahead of the January transfer window opens.</p>

      <p>Arsenal are said to be fearful that clubs interested in Xhaka will attempt to capitalise on the clash with supporters, and table a low offer.</p>
      <p>Xhaka was a £34m signing from Borussia Monchengladbach in 2016 and is still highly-regarded in the Bundesliga.</p>
      <p>Arsenal know they won't get anywhere near that fee in January but do not want to let him go on the cheap.</p>
      <p>Arsenal return to action at Leicester on Saturday with Xhaka's involvement unclear.</p>

      <p>The midfielder didn't feature against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> last weekend or in the Europa League clash with Vitoria.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Sokratis says Arsenal have to beat <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> to keep themselves in the Champions League race.</p>
      <p>Defeat at the King Power Stadium could see Emery’s side fall nine points off the pace for a top-four place.</p>
      <p>And the Greek defender said: “It’s a very big game, it’s a game we have to win.</p>
      <p>“We need to be consistent all year, not only one month. Leicester is in a very good moment, they’re a very hungry team. You can see this. We have to be ready to beat them.”</p>
