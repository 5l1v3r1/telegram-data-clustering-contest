      <p>That kept the pressure on Pep Guardiola's back-to-back champions, even at this early stage of the season.</p>
      <p>And Wijnaldum has told City to be aware of his side's ability to turn things around when all looks lost.</p>
      <p>"We just create that thing that we know we always can turn things around," he told the <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1201697/Liverpool-Georginio-Wijnaldum-Man-City">Daily Express</a> .</p>
      <p>"We always have that feeling, to stay positive.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“That's also because of the results we had until now, and the way we came back.</p>
      <p>"Our mindset is different, which is quite good, because we keep doing the things we want to do in a game.”</p>
