      <p>A closing down sale at Mothercare's UK stores is starting today.</p>
      <p>Goods are expected to be significantly reduced as the baby and maternity retailer prepares to close all 79 UK stores.</p>
      <p>The baby and maternity retailer is clearing stock after appointing administrators this week.</p>
      <p>The new administrators said it will close all of Mothercare's 79 shops in the UK, putting 2,500 jobs at risk.</p>
      <p>It came as Mothercare revealed it was holding last-ditch talks with potential partners as it battles to keep its brand in the UK and had raised Â£3.2m from shareholders.</p>
      <p>Mothercare Ireland has said it will "continue to trade as normal" - its 14 shops are unaffected by the status of the UK outlets.</p>
