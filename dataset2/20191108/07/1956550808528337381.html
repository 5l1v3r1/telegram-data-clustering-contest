      <p>O'Learys at Hilton <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/kids/421490-my-discovery-lab-dubai-launches-fun-science-book-for-kids">Dubai</a> Creek has introduced cool birthday party packages for <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/parties/415979-olioli-is-introducing-new-party-packages-and-birthday-workshops">kids</a>.</p>
      <p>Can't face the thought of hosting 20 six-year-olds in your back garden? Hand the reins over to the team at O'Learys and sit back and watch from a safe distance - perhaps with a glass of grape to ease the stress.</p>
      <p>The new Boston-themed restaurant and bar that serves up a range of all-American food and drinks is going one step further than decent food and is offering to host your child's birthday <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/kids/421877-seven-things-to-do-with-the-kids-this-month">party</a>. What parent could say no to that?</p>
      <p>A dedicated party zone is the perfect place to let them unleash their excitement with the restaurant's very smiley mascot, Larry.</p>
      <p>The friendly fox will be on hand (or should that be paw?) to entertain the little party animals as they enjoy the activities on offer.</p>
      <p>There are three packages to choose from starting from Dhs50 per child, with a minimum of 20 needed to make a booking.</p>
      <p>Each package includes party invitations, decorations, colouring mats and crayons, birthday hats, a kid's meal and an appearance from Larry.</p>
      <p>The premium package also includes a party host (just what every hassle-free birthday party needs) who organises the games, party bags for all the little guests, a face-painter and, because no party is complete without one, a birthday cake.</p>
      <p>Stress-free parties are a reason for everyone to celebrate â€“ mums and dads especially.<br/><i>From Dhs50 per child (minimum of 20 kids). Hilton Dubai Creek, Deira, Dubai, <a href="http://www.olearys.ae/dubaicreek">www.olearys.ae/dubaicreek</a> (04 212 7570).</i></p>
