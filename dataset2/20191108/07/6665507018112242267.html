      <h1>Calls For Dhoni Flood Twitter After Rishabh Pant's Stumping Error</h1>
      <h2>Yuzvendra Chahal had almost removed Bangladesh’s Liton Das, but replays confirmed that Pant collected the ball in front of the stumps.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T07:18:26+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 07:18</time> by <a rel="author">Akshita Jain</a></address>
      <p>India won the second T20I against Bangladesh on Thursday by eight wickets after skipper <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/Rohit-Sharma/">Rohit Sharma</a> made 85 off 43 balls. </p>
      <p>The three-match T20 series now stands at 1-1 and the final game will be played in Nagpur on 10 November.</p>
      <p>While fans (<a href="https://twitter.com/BCCI/status/1192489713157804032?s=20">and BCCI</a>) celebrated Sharma, several Twitter users could not help think of <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/MS-Dhoni/">MS Dhoni</a> after a stumping error by <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/Rishabh-Pant/">Rishabh Pant</a>. </p>
      <p>Yuzvendra Chahal had almost removed Bangladesh’s Liton Das, but replays confirmed that Pant collected the ball in front of the stumps. It was, hence, declared a no-ball. </p>

      </blockquote>
      <p>Chahal said that Pant’s faulty collection ahead of the stumps was part and parcel of the game.</p>
      <p>“We are team players, even I drop catches sometimes. No one wants to miss a catch or stumping, so no hard feelings with Pant. Just hard luck. Bowling in the death or powerplay gives you more confidence,” <i>PTI</i> quoted Chahal as saying.</p>
      <p>However, Twitter users were not at all happy and some asked why Dhoni wasn’t playing. </p>
      <p>In the first T20I against Bangladesh, Pant’s wrong DRS call had also invited comparisons with Dhoni (see <a href="https://www.news18.com/news/buzz/rishabh-pants-wrong-drs-call-against-bangladesh-reminds-dhoni-fans-why-he-is-goat-2372599.html">here</a> and <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/india-vs-bangladesh-2019-20/rishabh-pants-bad-day-behind-stumps-invites-ms-dhoni-comparisons-hilarious-memes-on-twitter-2126744">here</a>). Dhoni has not played for India since the World Cup semifinal in July. </p>
      <p>His retirement has been a constant topic of speculation since the World Cup. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/Yuvraj-Singh/">Yuvraj Singh</a> has constantly backed Pant, saying he doesn’t deserve the criticism he has been getting. On comparisons with Dhoni, Singh had said in September that people should refrain from doing so.</p>
      <p>“MS Dhoni was not made in a day. It took a few years, so it will take a few years for a replacement also. There is one year to go for the T20 World Cup, so that is still a long time,” Singh was quoted as saying by <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/rishabh-pant-is-work-in-progress-dont-suppress-him-yuvraj-singh/articleshow/71273010.cms"><i>IANS</i></a>.</p>
      <p>Former Australia cricketer Adam Gilchrist had also advised Pant to not try to be the next Dhoni. “My number one suggestion to Indian fans and journalists would be: don’t attempt to compare him with MS Dhoni. The mould that they used to make Dhoni, they have mashed it up once he was made. So that they make sure that there is not another one,” he was quoted as saying by <i>PTI</i>.</p>
      <p>That hasn’t stopped fans on Twitter:</p>
