        <b>Poland is to deport a Swedish far-right extremist who came to the country for training with weapons similar to those used in the attack on mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Polish officials said he had come to Poland for paramilitary training.</p>
      <p>Interior Minister Stanislaw Zaryn said that the country's security agency had found that the man posed a threat to security, reports international news agency AP.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old man, <a href="https://www.expressen.se/gt/svenska-nazisten-utvisas-fran-polen/">named in Swedish media</a> as Anton Thulin, was sentenced to one year and 10 months in jail in Sweden in connection with a planned bomb attack in Gothenburg almost three years ago. The explosives were found, undetonated, on a camping site near a home for asylum seekers.</p>
      <p>The incident was investigated as <a href="https://www.thelocal.se/20170609/gothenburg-sweden-two-men-charged-over-refugee-home-bomb-attack-received-military-training-in-russia">part of a series of three bomb incidents</a> in Gothenburg in 2016. One of them left an immigration office staff member seriously injured with wounds to his legs.</p>
      <p>Two other men were also charged in connection with the incidents, with one jailed over all three and the other jailed in connection with two of them.</p>
      <p>Thulin told the court at the time that he was no longer a member of the neo-Nazi Nordic Resistance Movement.</p>
      <p>The Swedish security police SÃ¤po, when approached by Swedish news agency TT, declined to say whether or not they had cooperated with their Polish counterparts to seize the man.</p>
