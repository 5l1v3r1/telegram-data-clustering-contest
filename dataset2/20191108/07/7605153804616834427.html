        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya Nov 8 –The National Treasury has restored the Judiciary’s budget as approved by the National Assembly days after Chief Justice David Maraga protested over a deliberate scheme by the Executive to underfund courts.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Chief Registrar of Judiciary, Anne Amadi, on Thursday said in an Internal Memo seen by Capital FM News the monies have already uploaded on the Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS).</p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>“The Judiciary’s Recurrent and Development Budget for the Financial Year 2019/2020 has been restored,” she said in the memo addressed to registrars, directors, heads of spending units, and heads of stations.</p>
      <p>“The budget for the half year has also been uploaded in the Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) as approved by the National Assembly.”</p>
      <p>It further pointed out that the Authority to Incur Expenditure for Courts and Tribunals are being processed and they will be issued in the shortest time possible.</p>
      <p>Amadi observed that the Implementation of all approved activities in 2019/2020 Financial Year work plans will also proceed as planned.</p>
      <p>On Monday, Maraga broke his silence over frustrations by the Executive citing underfunding and contempt by senior officials in President Uhuru Kenyatta’s administration.</p>

      <p>Maraga said the Judiciary needs about Sh5 billion annual infrastructure budget to establish court stations in each of the 290 constituencies in line with the judiciary transformation and expansion framework in the next 10 years.</p>
      <p>“Nobody is doing me a favor, the Judiciary should not be given its budget on the basis of<br/>how well the CJ speaks to those who control public funds,” he said.</p>

      <p>In 2017/18 Sh14.7 billion representing 0.69 per cent of the national budget was allocated to Judiciary, the judicial arm getting another Sh16 billion in the 2018/19 financial year.</p>
      <p>“As the Judiciary’s budget is dwindling, the workload is rising tremendously,” Maraga said.</p>
      <p>The High Court on October 28 restrained Acting National Treasury Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yattani from implementing austerity measures touching on the judiciary pending the hearing and determination of a suit filed by LSK.</p>
