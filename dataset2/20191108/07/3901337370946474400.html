      <p>Kaizer Chiefs’ Ernst Middendorp has admitted that he made decisions this week that were influenced by the upcoming Soweto Derby on Saturday afternoon…</p>

      <p>The Glamour Boys made eight changes last night when they went into battle with bottom-of-the-table Chippa United at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium, with only three players retaining their places from the side that started the Telkom Knockout win over the Buccaneers.</p>
      <p>Middendorp confirmed that the club’ medical team suggested that Khama Billiat, Lebogang Manyama and Erick Mathoho all needed a bit more rest, and he has also explained that his decision to leave out Daniel Akpeyi was based on the fact that a booking would have seen him miss this weekend’s bumper clash through suspension.</p>
      <p>As quoted by the club’s official website, the German said, “Daniel Akpeyi is clearly on three yellow cards and we had to look at that and make a decision in that area. I’m glad Bruce Bvuma played well and kept a clean sheet…</p>
      <p>“The games before and after the Soweto Derby are tricky. This one is more complicated and needed some juggling. Playing a Derby two weekends in a row and having a midweek game was always a challenge. A huge compliment goes to the players. They are really coming to the party and adapting well to the situation.” </p>

      <p>The coach did, however, take a risk on Willard Katsande though – another player who is one yellow card away from suspension – however his risk paid off as the Zimbabwean put in a Man of the Match-winning performance and didn’t pick up a yellow card in Port Elizabeth.</p>
