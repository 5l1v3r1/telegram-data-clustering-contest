      <p>The rate of completions has fallen for the first time in four years. It fell by 13.7% during April, May and June to 1,628.</p>
      <p>It is the first time the figures have fallen since 2015.</p>
      <p>Commencement notices have also dropped; they are down by close to a fifth.</p>
      <p>Rents are rising, and are up by 7% on last year to â‚¬1,700 a month on average.</p>
