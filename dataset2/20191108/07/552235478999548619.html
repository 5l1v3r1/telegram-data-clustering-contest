      <h1>St Mirren gaffer Goodwin says club had to knock back offer for priceless keeper Hladky</h1>
      <h2>The talented keeper this week revealed this season will be his last in Paisley.</h2>

      <p>Saints gaffer Jim Goodwin revealed the club knocked back money for Vaclav Hladky in the summer - because he was invaluable to keeping St Mirren in the Premiership this campaign.</p>
      <p>The talented keeper this week revealed this season will be his last in Paisley, after setting his sights on a move to the English Championship or Premier League.</p>
      <p>Hladky’s contract expires in June and while Goodwin knows he has a serious job on his hands to replace the 28-year-old fan favourite, he is delighted he can still call on him for the rest of the season.</p>
      <p>“It’s all well and good having the money but there’s nobody out there to replace him,” Goodwin said.</p>
      <p>“There was a bid and it was decent money but we sat down and discussed it. I felt he’d be difficult to replace at short notice.</p>
      <p>“The club knocked that back because we believe he’s more valuable to us to help stay in the league.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Nobody can have a go at Vaclav for seeing what’s out there. He’s earned the right.</p>
      <p>“If you look at the stats for goalkeepers in the league he’s up there in the top two or three every week for saves made, distribution, shot-stopping.</p>
      <p>“He’s a top keeper and we’ve been lucky to have him. If he does move on to new pastures then we wish him well.</p>
      <p>“I hope he gets the best club possible, whether it’s one of the top clubs in Scotland, England or abroad.”</p>
      <p>While Rangers have been linked with a move for the club’s playoff hero, Goodwin admits there are plenty of other suitors keeping an eye on hisNo 1.</p>
      <p>And he says the process to replace him has already started as St Mirren aim to find a suitable replacement to fill his gloves.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He said: “Vaclav’s done great, but as of January he’s entitled to talk to anybody. We’ve done our best, we’ve made him a really good offer but he wants to go and speak to every club out there and he’s within his rights to do that. We haven’t any issue with it.</p>
      <p>“In terms of us knowing that Vaclav was 99 per cent likely to be leaving, we have to put things in place to make sure we have a replacement coming in.</p>
      <p>“It would be stupid of us not to be doing that. We’ve identified a number of goalkeepers we believe would fit the bill.”</p>
      <p>“Vaclav will be a difficult one to replace but I’m confident he won’t be distracted by the interest that’s out there. If anything, it’ll drive him on and give him more confidence.”</p>
