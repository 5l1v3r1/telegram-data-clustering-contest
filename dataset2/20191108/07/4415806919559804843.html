      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T07:22:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 07:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>Psychiatric nurses are to strike later today to highlight overcrowding in a unit at University Hospital Waterford.</p>
      <p>They say unprecedented levels of overcrowding, and staffing shortages, are continuously compromising standards of care for service users and placing staff working in the psychiatric unit under "intolerable pressure".</p>

      <p>The Psychiatric Nurses Association says mental health services have been massively neglected since the recession in 2008, with hundreds of nurses moving abroad and several hundred vacancies in the service.</p>
      <p>Industrial relations officer with the PNA Michael Hayes says those in authority need to stop burying their heads in the sand.</p>
      <p>"There is no one in the HSE (or) Health Commission (or) Government that doesn't know this is going on," he said.</p>
      <p>"No one there can say they don't know it's going on for the last two years. We're looking for a commitment now to ensure that this never happens again."</p>
