      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T07:05:03+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 07:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://nairametrics.com/author/titobioluwa-okunade/" target="_blank">Titobioluwa Okunade</a></address>
      <p>Members of <b>Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria</b> (IPMAN) in Osun State have been warned to desist from diversion of petrol by the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR).</p>
      <p><b>Wole Akinyosoye,</b> <a href="https://www.vanguardngr.com/2019/11/dpr-warns-ipman-against-product-diversion/">Zonal Operations Controller DPR,</a> speaking at a workshop organised to sensitize IPMAN in Ilesa yesterday, said the penalty for diversion is a fine of N200 per litre of petrol diverted from the state or town it was intended to be supplied to.</p>
      <p>“<i>The regulated product (PMS) has already been subsidized and meant for a particular location to enjoy that subsidy. “For you to bring a product that is meant for Lagos to Ilesa for example, you have diverted the product and it attracts N200 fine per litre</i>”, Mr Akinyosoye.</p>

      <p><b>The DPR’s Osogbo Operations Manager,</b> Ademola Makinde also warned IPMAN to desist from getting petrol from illegal sources for its business. He said purchasing petrol from illegal depot is unfavourable to the nation’s economy, stressing the importance for all stakeholders in the oil and gas sector to collaborate and fight the menace.</p>
      <p><b>Mr Makinde</b>, who described IPMAN as a partner in progress in oil and gas business, added that IPMAN should abide by regulatory requirements for the sales and distribution of petroleum product in their areas. He also appealed to IPMAN to collaborate with the department to sanitize the oil and gas sector by reporting those engaging in shady practices.</p>

      </p>
      <p>“<i>Let us make our environment and Nigeria better. Oil and gas does not only generate financial benefits but also cause hazards if not properly handled</i>.”</p>
      <p>“<i>Consequently, this sensitization workshop in this zone is very paramount to avail members with the regulations and ensure compliance,</i>” Makinde said.</p>
      <p><b>Meanwhile,</b> the Head of Operations of the DPR, Mr Olusegun Dabor, in his own statement said under dispensing of petrol was criminal and capable of undermining the integrity of IPMAN. He asked IPMAN to stop this act, while he warned filing stations operating without or with expired license to desist from the act and renew their license.</p>
