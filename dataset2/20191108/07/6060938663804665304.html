      <p>FUZHOU: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Satwiksairaj-Rankireddy">Satwiksairaj Rankireddy</a> and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Chirag-Shetty">Chirag Shetty</a> continued their fine run at China Open BWF Super-750 Tournament. On Friday, the Indians dumped the 2018 world champions Li Jun Hui and Liu Yu Chen in straight games 21-19, 21-15 in front of their home crowd in Fuzhou.</p>
      <p>This is the second successive victory for the Indians against the 2018 world champions. The young Indian duo dominated the local shuttlers in the 43-minute quarter-final clash.

      <p>Chirag told TOI that their game plan worked well against the Chinese. "I am pretty happy with the way we played against the Chinese. The game plan worked out pretty good for us. We defended very well today and that worked in our favour," Chirag said.</p>
      <p>On facing the world No.1 team in the semifinals, Chirag said, "We have played them seven times. We haven’t won against them. So we don’t have any pressure facing them because there is nothing to lose. We have to make quite a few changes in our game to beat them. We can’t play the usual game that we played the last two days. If we execute the game plan then definitely we have a chance against them."</p>
      <p>Satwik said that they are pretty confident throughout this tournament. "We are playing quite well in this tournament. We are pretty confident. But tomorrow it will be a different ball game against the Indonesians because they prepare well against us. We need to be strong both mentally and physically," Satwik said.</p>
      <p>The two tall Indians, who had earlier trained under Kim Tan Her of South Korea, have sharpened their skills, particularly their endurance under the new Indonesian coach Flandy Limpele.</p>
      <p>On Friday, the first game of the quarterfinal went down to the wire before Satwik and Chirag raised their game to get past the third seed Chinese pair.</p>
      <p>The Chinese, who were down 11-15 at one stage, made a splendid comeback and were even leading at 17-16. However, the Indian boys defended well and with Chirag guarding the net well, they kept their nerves at crucial moments and scored the winners.</p>
      <p>In the second game, there was little to separate between the two teams till 12-12. At this juncture, the Indians went ahead securing three straight points to gain an upper hand over the Chinese.</p>
      <p>From the bottom-half of the draw, Malaysians Aaron Chia and Soh Wooi Yik stunned world champions Mohammad Ahsan and Hendra Setiawan of Indonesia 21-13, 22-20 while Japanese fourth seeds Takeshi Kamura and Keigo Sonoda drubbed Marcus Ellis and Chris Langridge of England 21-10, 21-13.</p>
