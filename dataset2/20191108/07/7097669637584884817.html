      <p>Singapore (AFP) - Police in Singapore are investigating a YouTube star from Hong Kong who allegedly organised a gathering to discuss the protests in his home city, a potential violation of tough public assembly laws.</p>
      <p>Singapore's elite are increasingly nervous about the unrest in rival financial hub Hong Kong, observers say, as they fear it could inspire demonstrations in the tightly controlled city-state where protests are rare.</p>
      <p>Alex Yeung, a restaurateur known for his anti-protest tirades on YouTube, allegedly held the gathering last month which started in a bar and shifted to a public area, police said.</p>
      <p>Footage circulating online showed Yeung at a Singapore bar with what appeared to be about two dozen people, criticising the protesters and Hong Kong pro-democracy figures.</p>
      <p>Organising a public assembly without a permit in Singapore is punishable by a fine of up to Sg$5,000 ($3,700). Repeat offenders can be fined up to Sg$10,000 or jailed for a maximum of six months or both.</p>
      <p>"The police will not grant any permit for assemblies that advocate political causes of other countries. Foreigners visiting or living in Singapore should abide by our laws," they said in a statement Thursday.</p>
      <p>Yeung has not been arrested but his passport has been confiscated while he assists in investigations, they said.</p>
      <p>Singapore only allows protests without a police permit in the corner of one downtown park.</p>
      <p>Yeung said in a video posted on Monday that he came to Singapore to look for business opportunities and accused supporters of the protests of setting him up at the gathering.</p>
      <p>"I never thought I would violate any laws in Singapore and I never thought to engage in political activities," he said. His lawyer said he was co-operating with police.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong has been shaken by five months of increasingly violent demonstrations, with protesters calling for greater democratic freedoms and police accountability.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said last month that Singapore would be "finished" if similar protests erupted there.</p>
      <p>"It will become impossible to govern Singapore, to make and carry out difficult decisions or to plan for the long-term good of the nation," he said.</p>
