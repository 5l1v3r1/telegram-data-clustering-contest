      <h1>Scott McTominay provides injury update ahead of Man Utd clash with Brighton</h1>
      <h2>Manchester United midfielder Scott McTominay limped off with a foot problem during the victory over Partizan Belgrade on Thursday night</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T07:18:01+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 07:18</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>Scott McTominay is confident he will be fit for Manchester United's clash with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> .</p>
      <p>The Scottish midfielder picked up a knock during the Europa League victory over Partizan Belgrade at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>McTominay was replaced by Jesse Lingard during the 3-0 victory and his withdrawal led to concerns he would miss Sunday's visit of Brighton.</p>
      <p>But McTominay confirmed he "should be fine" for the encounter despite the foot problem.</p>
      <p>On his midfielder, boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said: "I don't know how bad it will be.</p>
      <p>"He said he was going to be okay, but then he couldn't [carry on] so hopefully he will be okay for Sunday. But I don't know."</p>

      <p>Harry Maguire also appeared to pick up a problem in the second half of the victory but Solskjaer is confident he will be ready this weekend.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer added: "I think Harry will be OK. He finished the game anyway.</p>
      <p>"Scott is more of a concern, so let's see how he recovers in the next few days."</p>

      <p>United's attacking trio of Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Mason Greenwood were all on target and Solskjaer was unsurprisingly full of praise for his players.</p>
      <p>He added: "That was the reason we played the three of them as well. We felt if we played a strong team and created chances, we needed players out there to take them.</p>
      <p>"This is a little bit of a template on how we want to play, definitely.</p>
      <p>"But of course it's the opposition that allows you to play this way as well.</p>
