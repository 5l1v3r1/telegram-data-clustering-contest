      <p>Hey, good morning! You look fabulous.</p>
      <p>It's finally <i>Death Stranding</i> day, and if you're still on the fence about playing Hideo Kojima's latest project, perhaps our added perspective can help. Apple has released another update to iOS 13 that should make multitasking better, and it's time to take a peek inside the Surface Pro X tablet.</p>

      <p>You didn't have to wait too long for Apple to fix iOS 13.2's over-eagerness to kill background apps. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/07/apple-ios-13-2-2-fixes-background-apps/">iOS 13.2.2 update</a> should help stop apps from closing quite so quickly -- much like they did before 13.2 arrived. This should mean less need to restart resource-intensive streaming services and games as you swap between messaging and other apps.</p>

      <p>Hideo Kojima builds cinematic games. His projects are visually ambitious, narratively complex and cutscene-heavy, dripping with references to the vaults of Alfred Hitchcock, George Romero and Orson Welles. Kojima is transparent about his obsession with film and how it influences his creative process.</p>
      <p>Not to mention fan service -- have you seen the guy's Twitter? <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/07/death-stranding-is-a-great-movie/"><i>Death Stranding</i></a> is a game that's been a long time coming, with numerous trailers, promotions, Hollywood stars and the rest. Jessica Conditt tackles Kojima's new opus and attempts to square whether it's meant to be a movie or a game.</p>

      <p>Google's updated mesh WiFi gear is great for novice users looking to set up and forget about their wireless network. However, power users may find it's missing a few features and new technology like WiFi 6, and while the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/07/google-nest-wifi-review/">Nest WiFi's</a> built-in voice assistant is convenient, it also adds some privacy concerns.</p>
