      <p>OAKLAND, Calif. -- Josh Jacobs scored on an 18-yard run with 1:02 remaining and the Oakland Raiders had a late winning touchdown drive for the second time in five weeks, beating the Los Angeles Chargers 26-24 on Thursday night.<br/><br/>Derek Carr led the Raiders (5-4) down the field methodically 75 yards after Philip Rivers threw a 6-yard pass to Austin Ekeler that gave the Chargers (4-6) a 24-20 lead with 4:02 remaining.<br/><br/>Carr completed three passes to Jalen Richard and two to Hunter Renfrow before Jacobs finished the drive with his seventh touchdown of his rookie season.<br/><br/>The victory didn't come easy as Daniel Carlson missed the extra point, putting more pressure on the tired Raiders defense to stop Rivers. Trayvon Mullen was called for holding on a fourth-down pass to extend the drive, but Karl Joseph then intercepted a fourth-down pass from Rivers to seal it.<br/><br/>Joseph also had the game-sealing pass breakup Sunday against Detroit after Carr threw a TD pass to Renfrow in a 31-24 victory.<br/><br/>Rivers threw interceptions on his first two drives, falling into a 10-0 hole when Erik Harris took the second back 56 yards for a TD. But Rivers responded by throwing two TD passes, including the go-ahead score to Ekeler in his final start at the Coliseum.<br/><br/>The Raiders blew a chance to open up the game in the third quarter, settling for a field goal after driving to the 4 on the opening drive and then missing a 53-yard field goal in the next drive after DeAndre Washington got stuffed for no gain on third-and-1.<br/><br/>The Chargers settled for a field goal after getting inside the 10 later in the quarter.<br/><br/>Melvin Gordon had 22 carries for 108 yards and a TD that put the Chargers up 14-10 in the second quarter.<br/><br/>The Raiders responded with their first sustained drive of the game and took a 17-14 lead at the half on Carr's 9-yard pass to rookie fullback Alec Ingold with 20 seconds remaining in the second quarter.<br/><br/>The loss puts the Chargers into a deeper third-place hole in the AFC West with a 4-6 record, behind the Raiders who are now 5-4.<br/><br/>The Kansas City Chiefs remain atop the division at 6-3. The Chargers face the Chiefs on Nov. 18 in Mexico City.</p>
