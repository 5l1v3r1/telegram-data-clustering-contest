      <h1>Up to Rs 2.65 lakh off on Hyundai Tucson, Grand i10, i20, Santro and more</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T07:00:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Shirish Gandhi</a></address>
      <p>Through November, sizeable benefits can be availed on Hyundai’s wide range of cars and SUVs.</p>
      <p>Even though the Indian automotive industry has been witnessing its worst downturn in the past two decades, the month of October brought some respite, in light of the festive season. In order to keep the positive momentum going in November, Hyundai has authorised its dealer partners to offer considerable benefits on a wide range of vehicles in its stable, except the recently launched Grand i10 Nios, the popular Venue and the Kona Electric. Read on to find out how much you could save on the deal of a brand-new Hyundai vehicle this month.</p>
      <h3>Hyundai Tucson</h3>
      <p><b>Save up to Rs 2.65 lakh</b><br/>The Tucson is the Korean automaker’s flagship offering in our market. Comfortable, spacious and packed with equipment, the SUV rivals the likes of the Jeep Compass, Honda CR-V and Volkswagen Tiguan. Low sales numbers and an upcoming model refresh mean that dealers are extending benefits to the tune of Rs 2.65 lakh on the existing model, including a cash discount, exchange bonus and corporate benefits. The Tucson draws its power from a pair of 2.0-litre petrol and diesel engines, both available with the choice of a manual or an automatic gearbox. The top-end diesel auto also boasts of an all-wheel drive system.</p>
      <h3>Hyundai Elantra </h3>
      <p>
        <b>Save up to Rs 2.4 lakh</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hyundai updated the Elantra last month with sharper styling, more equipment and an upgraded, BS6 compliant, 2.0-litre petrol engine. To clear stocks of the pre-facelift car, the company is offering discounts as high as Rs 2.4 lakh on the older model. Complementing the lower price tag are an attractive design, decent levels of kit and a 2.0-litre diesel engine (that the facelifted model misses out on); all of which still make the previous Elantra a compelling buy. The Hyundai contender in the executive sedan segment dukes it out with the Toyota Corolla Altis, Honda Civic and the Skoda Octavia.</p>
      <h3>Hyundai Grand i10</h3>
      <p><b>Save up to Rs 85,000</b><br/>Not to be confused with the plusher Grand i10 Nios that launched recently, the Grand i10 has been on sale in our market in its current avatar for quite some time. However, good build and refinement levels still make it a decent buy. With the variant line-up being trimmed down to just the mid-spec Magna and Sportz trims in the 1.2-litre, petrol-manual guises, the Grand i10 can be had with savings of up to Rs 85,000 in November, including an exchange bonus, as well as cash and corporate discounts.</p>
      <h3>Hyundai Verna</h3>
      <p><b>Save up to Rs 80,000<i> </i></b><br/>The Verna is Hyundai’s contender against the venerable Honda City and Maruti Suzuki Ciaz in our market. It's available with 1.4-litre and 1.6-litre petrol engines as well as similar-capacity diesel units; and gets a manual transmission as standard. An automatic gearbox can also be opted for on the higher-capacity petrol and diesel motors. Since the new <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/hyundai-verna-facelift-interior-revealed-414576"><b>heavily facelifted model is headed for our shores next year</b></a>, the existing model is being offered with overall benefits of up to Rs 80,000.</p>
      <h3>Hyundai i20</h3>
      <p><b>Save up to Rs 80,000<i> </i></b><br/>The Elite i20 is often credited with popularising premium hatchbacks in our market, and for good reason – it gets a stylish design, comfortable cabin and decent levels of kit. Multiple feature revisions over the years have also ensured that the model stays competitive against the Maruti Suzuki Baleno, Toyota Glanza and the Honda Jazz. The i20 will take a generational leap with an <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/2020-hyundai-i20-to-get-dct-auto-option-in-india-413872"><b>all-new model slated to arrive next year</b></a>. Consequently, the current-gen model can be had with savings of up to Rs 80,000 on the higher-spec Sportz+ and Asta(O) trims and Rs 50,000 on the lower Era and Magna+ variants. Powering the premium Hyundai hatch is either an 83hp, 1.2-litre petrol engine or a 90hp, 1.4-litre diesel motor. While a manual transmission is standard, a CVT auto gearbox can also be opted for in case of the petrol. </p>
      <h3>Hyundai Santro</h3>
      <p><b>Save up to Rs 70,000<i> </i></b><br/>Hyundai resurrected the Santro name last year with the launch of an all-new model. Boasting contemporary design cues and decent equipment levels, today’s Santro is far removed from the erstwhile hatchback – except for an updated version of the original’s 1.1-litre petrol engine. The Maruti Suzuki Wagon R and Tata Tiago rival also gets the choice of an AMT automatic gearbox and even a factory-fit CNG kit on some variants. Interested customers can avail benefits up to Rs 70,000 on the budget hatch, including cash and corporate discounts, in addition to an exchange bonus.</p>
      <h3>Hyundai i20 Active</h3>
      <p><b>Save up to Rs 40,000 </b><br/>The i20 Active could very well be thought of as an Elite i20 with raised ground clearance and some rugged stylistic touches. Barring the automatic transmission, it even shares powertrain options with its standard sibling. This month, those looking for a hatchback with some ‘crossover’ flavour can have the i20 Active with benefits amounting up to Rs 40,000.</p>
