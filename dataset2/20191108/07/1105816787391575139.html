      <h1>Pakistan's ex-polio focal person seeks apology from UK daily over polio cover-up allegations</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T07:38:29+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 07:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/7761/news-2/" target="_blank">News Desk</a></address>
      <p>The country’s former focal person on polio eradication, Babar bin Atta, denounced a report published by British daily The Guardian and sought an apology over accusations of “covering-up” a polio outbreak.</p>
      <p>Babar termed the allegations “baseless”.</p>
      <p>“I wish, I just wish, if Guardian had contacted me even once for my version. They even don’t know that Pakistan reported a bigger VDPV outbreak in 2016/17 in Balochistan. Noone blamed Ayesha Raza (PMLN) &amp; today the same Attention seeking Ayesha Raza is quoted by The Guardian,” he said in a tweet on Friday.</p>

      <p>The former focal person further said that he would be writing to the publication to “correct the record and issue an apology”, otherwise he would pursue legal options.</p>

      <p>The report added that the P2 strain had previously been eliminated from Pakistan. Polio exists in three different strands, P1, P2, and P3, with P2 notorious as the most contagious and most vicious in its impact on those infected.</p>
