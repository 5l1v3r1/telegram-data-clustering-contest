      <h1>Porsche Cayman Electric Rumored To Have 400 Horsepower</h1>
      <h2>It's due to launch in 2023 alongside a Boxster EV.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T07:10:13+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 07:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.motor1.com/info/team/adrian-padeanu/" target="_blank">Adrian Padeanu</a></address>
      <p>It’s a known fact by now the replacements for the Boxster and Cayman are going to feature a purely electric powertrain. The disclosure was made a couple of months ago by Lutz Meschke, deputy chairman of the board at Porsche, in an interview with <i><a href="https://www.topgear.com/car-news/electric/porsches-boxster-and-cayman-replacements-will-be-electric">Top Gear</a></i> magazine at the launch event of the Taycan. In a fresh report, <i><a href="https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/spy-shots/porsche/electric-boxster-and-cayman-sports-car/">CAR Magazine</a> </i>claims to have some preliminary technical specifications regarding the dynamic duo expected to go on sale around 2023.</p>
      <p>It appears the electric convertible and coupe will feature dual electric motors with a combined output of 400 horsepower, which would put them between the GTS and the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/355199/porsche-cayman-boxster-gt4-spyder/">Spyder / GT4</a> in terms of output. The cars are apparently being developed around an aluminum monocoque and will be available with rear- or all-wheel drive. Logic tells us the former will likely feature a single electric motor driving the rear axle, much like the Taycan sedan is expected to spawn a more attainable single-motor version.</p>

      <p>Interestingly, the report goes on to mention the electric <a href="https://www.motor1.com/porsche/718-boxster/">Boxster</a> and Cayman will share the hardware with an Audi TTE and the rebirth of the Lamborghini Urraco. Sold between 1972 and 1979, the raging bull took the shape of a 2+2 coupe penned by Marcello Gandini and with power coming from a V8 offered in different stages of output.</p>
      <p><i>CAR Magazine</i> suggests Rimac will be involved in the development of the zero-emissions sports cars following Porsche’s decision to increase its stake in the Croatian company to <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/369362/porsche-stake-in-rimac-grows/">15.5 percent</a>. <i>Top Gear</i> believes the electric Macan’s Premium Platform Electric (PPE) could also serve as a foundation for the electric Boxster and <a href="https://www.motor1.com/porsche/718-cayman/">Cayman</a>. <i>TG</i> also thinks the arrival of the EVs won’t spell the end of the traditional versions as there could be a period of time of 2-3 years when the ICE and EV models will peacefully coexist.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.motor1.com/porsche/">Porsche</a> isn’t quite done with the current-gen Cayman as the company has hinted at coming out with a hardcore GT4 RS version, which we might’ve spied already undergoing testing.</p>
