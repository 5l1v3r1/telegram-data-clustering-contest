      <h2>Wolverhampton Wanderers 1-0 Slovan Bratislava reaction | Wolves' important Europa League win at Molineux was marred somewhat by a serious injury to Kenan Bajric in the second half of the clash</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T07:00:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Dicken, https://www.facebook.com/alexdickenjournalist/?fref=ts</a></address>
      <p>Slovan Bratislava defender Kenan Bajric spent last night in Wolverhampton after suffering a horrible injury at Molineux.</p>
      <p>Bajric, 24, was rushed to hospital after being struck on the head by Raul Jimenez’s attempted overhead kick during <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/wolves-player-ratings-slovan-bratislava-17221528">Wolves’ 1-0 Europa League win at Molineux.</a></p>
      <p>There was immediate concern from Jimenez and several of Bajric’s teammates after he hit the deck, with goalkeeper Dominik Greif racing to put him in the recovery position.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>After lengthy treatment on the field from medics Bajric came round before being carried off on a stretcher and taken to hospital for further tests.</p>
      <p>Slovan manager Jan Kozak said: “At the moment it looks like it’s a head injury and quite serious. He’s not going home with us, he will stay here overnight to be observed.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The victory puts <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> on the brink of qualification from Group K - but thoughts inside Molineux quickly turned to Bajric once the match had finished.</p>
      <p>“I just spoke with the staff to wish him all the best,” added Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo.</p>
