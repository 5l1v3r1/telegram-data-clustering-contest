      <p><a href="https://insidebitcoins.com/news/new-prediction-market-platform-bispex-focuses-exclusively-on-cryptocurrencies/241423">Bispex crypto prediction platform</a> aims to become the one-stop prediction arena for cryptocurrency price. Due to the fact that cryptocurrencies are decentralized, and are volatile in nature, it is very difficult for anyone to manipulate their price.</p>
      <p>The platform explains that it is the exact reason why they are only focusing on cryptocurrency price predictions. Other topics, like politics, weather, and others, can have arbitrary or disputable results which could delay the handing out of payments and thus besmirch the reputation of the platform.</p>
      <p>Users can make their predictions on the platform through the use of BPX. This is due to the intention of the platform to make trades and payouts more liquid. Moreover, it is also mulling over the creation of an exchange service in the future to better serve its users.</p>
      <p>Bispex is led by CEO Ashish Babar, along with CTO Mike Kwon, CSO Desiree Yoo, and CMO Patrick Chun. They are based in Hong Kong, and they are working with a team of blockchain and web developers.</p>
