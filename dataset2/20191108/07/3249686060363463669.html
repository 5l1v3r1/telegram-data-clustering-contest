      <p>Due to recent developments involving police investigations into <b>Mnet</b>'s '<b>Produce 48</b>' and '<b>Produce X 101</b>', <b>tvN</b>'s '<b>Amazing Saturday - Doremi Market</b>' and<b> JTBC</b>'s '<b>Idol Room</b>' will not be airing this coming weekend and in approximately two weeks, respectively.</p>
      <p>On November 8, representatives from 'Idol Room' told media outlets, <i>"'Idol Room' will not be airing this coming November 19. There is nothing confirmed regarding what will air instead in the timeslot." </i></p>
      <p>The November 19 broadcast of 'Idol Room' was originally scheduled to show <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/izone">IZ*ONE</a>'s guest appearance, in light of their comeback. However, due to the fact that <b>Ahn Joon Young</b> PD has recently admitted to vote rigging allegations during 'Produce 48' and 'Produce X 101', IZ*ONE have cancelled their comeback altogether, issuing refunds to fans who pre-ordered their album. </p>
      <p>Similarly, tvN's 'Amazing Saturday' will also not be airing this November 9, as IZ*ONE members <b>Jang Won Young</b> and <b>Choi Ye Na</b> were expected to appear as guests.</p>
      <p>However, also on November 8, <b>Netflix</b>'s '<b>Busted</b>' season 2 representatives stated, "<i>There will be no changes to IZ*ONE's pre-filmed content."</i> Members of IZ*ONE will be making cameo appearances in 'Busted' season 2 alongside numerous other cameo stars, and the series has chosen not to edit out the members' portions.</p>
