      <p><b>COLUMBUS, OhioÂ (AP)</b> - A federal judge has ruled inmates awaiting trial must be given the same voting rights as other Ohio citizens.</p>
      <p>The Columbus Dispatch reports U.S. District Court Judge Michael Watson ruled this week in a 2018 lawsuit filed against Ohio's secretary of state by two Montgomery County inmates. The lawsuit argues state law violates the U.S. Constitution by treating pre-trial inmates differently than other voters.</p>
      <p>Ohio law grants voters confined in hospitals by unforeseen medical emergencies until 3 p.m. Election Day to apply for an absentee ballot, while inmates have a deadline of noon the Saturday before an election.</p>
      <p>The judge granted the lawsuit class-action status and ordered Secretary of State Frank LaRose not to impose different absentee ballot deadlines on inmates.</p>
      <p>A LaRose spokeswoman said they're reviewing the ruling.</p>
