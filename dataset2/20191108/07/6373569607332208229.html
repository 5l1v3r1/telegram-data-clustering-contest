      <h1>Plymouth has a pasty hotline for hungry Janners</h1>
      <h2>The Truly Scrumptious Cakery sets up telephone number so pasty lovers can order an oggy baked especially for them</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T07:00:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">William Telford</a></address>
      <p>US President John F Kennedy had one direct to the Soviet premier, and British PM John Major had one for road cones, but Plymouth has gone one further by having a hotline for pasties.</p>
      <p>Cattedown’s Truly Scrumptious Cakery has set up a pasty hotline so hungry people can ring up and order an Oggy, freshly baked to order, and collect it 70 minutes later.</p>
      <p>The cakery’s owner Karen Hibberd came up with the idea after demand soared for<a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/early-learning-centre-plymouth-turned-2803822"> the Malcolm Barnecutt Bakery Ltd pasties</a> she sells – the only outlet in Plymouth to stock them until Cornwall-based Barnecutt opens its own shop in the city centre soon.</p>
      <p>She said people were so worried their favourite flavour would sell out – be it rump steak, rump steak and Stilton, or cheese and onion – she set up the hotline, number 07967 327702, so a particular pasty will be baked just for them.</p>

      <p>“We are actually the only place in Devon that has Barnecutt pasties,” said Mrs Hibberd. “They are lovely pasties and very popular.</p>
      <p>“So we set up a pasty hotline for people who want a specific one. We collect them frozen from Cornwall but bake them here to order. It takes only one hour and 10 minutes to bake a pasty. I don’t like the idea of a pasty sitting in a pasty warmer for six or seven hours.</p>
      <p>“People can ring and ask us to keep, for instance, a steak and Stilton for 1pm, and we will bake it just for them. I think we are the only place with such a hotline and already do it for a lot of people.”</p>
      <p>Truly Scrumptious Cakery’s main business is, as the name suggests, cakes. It sells them from its premises in Cattedown Road, but also makes to order, particularly for special occasions.</p>
      <p>“I’ve just taken an order for a 100th birthday cake,” said Mrs Hibberd. “But I have tray baked cakes too and people can pop in and buy one.</p>
      <p>“But on a good day I can also go through an entire box of pasties. That’s three dozen. And for functions we can do mini cocktail pasties, rump steak and cheese and onion, also made to order.</p>

      <p>“We do gluten free pasties too, but they are not Barnecutt’s. We also do vegan cakes, dairy-free and soya-free, even wedding cakes. We can make any cakes without certain ingredients.”</p>
      <p>Malcolm Barnecutt Bakery will be setting up a cafe and takeaway in the former Early Learning Centre premises on Cornwall Street, but Mrs Hibberd said Truly Scrumptious Cakery will continue to sell the brand.</p>
      <p>“They are coming to the city centre, and I’m glad, they are high-quality pasties, and if you are in the city centre and want a pasty that is fine,” she said. “But if you are not you can come here, and we have free parking.”</p>
      <p>Mrs Hibberd, aged 56, worked in the care industry for 15 years while baking as a hobby, before deciding to make cake-making her career in 2017.</p>
      <p>“I baked for friends and relatives,” she said. “It progressed from there and took over my life.”</p>

      <p>Now she runs a business, with husband John making the models, such as mini brides and teeny grooms, for cakes. She has one employee and a student, Anna Baker, who is studying patisserie and confectionery at City College Plymouth.</p>
      <p>She said the biggest trend in the baking industry is the demand for products made with specific ingredients either in or out.</p>
      <p>“Vegan has got really big,” she said. “And more and more people are becoming aware of intolerances. We are looking at doing vegan pasties, but the big problem is the pastry. We are also working on a vegetarian quiche.”</p>
