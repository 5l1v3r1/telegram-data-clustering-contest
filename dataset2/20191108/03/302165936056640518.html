      <p>TOKYO, Nov 8 — Japanese authorities have seized a record-breaking 400 kilogrammes of cocaine worth an estimated US$73 million (RM301 million) in a bust at a port in the city of Kobe, a customs spokesman said today.</p>
      <p>The discovery in the western city was made last month but came to light today, with officials saying they could not provide additional details because the investigation was ongoing.</p>
      <p>“This is record-breaking, in terms of volume” for a cocaine bust, the spokesman told AFP.</p>
      <p>It far exceeds the previous record set just months earlier in August, when authorities seized 177 kilogrammes of cocaine at another port, in central Japan’s Aichi prefecture.</p>
      <p>It was unclear yet where the cocaine came from, and Kyodo News agency, citing unnamed investigative sources, said the drugs may have been sent to Kobe by mistake.</p>
      <p>Japan has strict drug laws and users face severe public opprobrium if caught.</p>
      <p>Drug use and possession by even moderately famous people, including television actors and little-known athletes, can make national headlines for days.</p>
      <p>Experts warn however that casual drug use among young people is becoming a growing problem.</p>
      <p>Drug sales are a major financial pillar for Japanese organised crimes, including the infamous yakuza. — AFP</p>
