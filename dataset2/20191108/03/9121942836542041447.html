      <p>MOSCOW (AP) — Russia’s foreign minister says the world is becoming increasingly unstable because the U.S. doesn’t want to abide by arms control regimes.</p>
      <p>Speaking at a conference on disarmament in Moscow on Friday, Sergey Lavrov accused the U.S. of seeing arms control treaties as a constraint to its efforts to boost its military.</p>
      <p>Russia and the U.S. both withdrew from the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty this year. The U.S. said it pulled out because of Russian violations, a claim the Kremlin has denied.</p>
      <p>Lavrov reaffirmed Russia’s pledge not to deploy the missiles banned by the treaty until the U.S. does so and criticized NATO allies for refusing to make a similar pledge.</p>
      <p>Lavrov said that the U.S. appears reluctant to extend the New START treaty that expires in 2021.</p>
