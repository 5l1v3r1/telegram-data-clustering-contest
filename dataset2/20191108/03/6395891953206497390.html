      <p><b>NEW YORKÂ (AP)</b> - Bryan Rust scored his second goal of the game in overtime and the Pittsburgh Penguins rallied past the Islanders 4-3 on Thursday night in Brooklyn to end New York's 10-game winning streak.</p>
      <p>Pittsburgh erased a three-goal deficit in the third period and snapped its three-game skid. Jared McCann had a goal and two assists, and Evgeni Malkin also scored for the Penguins. Matt Murray made 20 saves.</p>
      <p>Casey Cizikas, Cal Clutterbuck and Adam Pelech scored for New York. Semyon Varlamov stopped 35 shots.</p>
      <p>Rust took the puck from Islanders center Brock Nelson behind the net and scored on a wraparound 3:25 into the extra session. Rust extended his point streak to five games.</p>
      <p>McCann ended Varlamov's shutout bid when his wrist shot got by the goalie 1:38 into the third to spark the Penguins' comeback. Pittsburgh defensemen John Marino and Brian Dumoulin helped set up the play.</p>
      <p>Rust and Malkin followed up McCann's goal with scores of their own as the Penguins wiped out their three-goal deficit in 7:10.</p>
      <p>Rust snapped a wrist shot over Varlamov's glove after Murray made a sprawling save on Anthony Beauvillier's backhand at the other end. McCann and Malkin assisted on the goal.</p>
      <p>Malkin tied it 3-all at 8:48 when he swatted home a long rebound. It was his second goal of the season in five games. Juuso Riikola and McCann assisted.</p>
      <p>Cizikas opened the scoring when he sneaked a backhand past Murray just 19 seconds into the game. Michael Dal Colle deflected the puck behind the net, and Cizikas beat a confused Murray to the far post. Dal Colle and Ryan Pulock got assists.</p>
      <p>Clutterbuck scored short-handed for the second straight game at 6:28 of the second period when his wrist shot whizzed between Murray's pads to give New York a 2-0 advantage. The Islanders have killed off 24 of 25 penalties over the past eight games.</p>
      <p>Pelech stepped into a slap shot at 9:26 of the second to make it 3-0. The original shot was deflected by Penguins forward Teddy Blueger while Anders Lee provided a screen at the top of the crease. Lee and Mathew Barzal assisted.</p>
      <p>NOTES: Pittsburgh played without defenseman Kris Letang, who sustained a lower-body injury in the third period of a 6-4 loss at Boston on Monday. ... Islanders defenseman Nick Leddy missed his third straight game while nursing a lower-body injury and is day-to-day. ... Lee has played in 215 consecutive games. . New York recalled Seth Helgeson and Otto Koivula from Bridgeport of the AHL, but neither dressed. . Dominik Simon's four-game point streak against the Islanders ended. . The Penguins scratched forward Sam Lafferty and defenseman Chad Ruhwedel.</p>
