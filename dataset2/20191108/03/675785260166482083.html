      <h2>Natalia Grace Barnett insists she was just trying to clean when her former adoptive mum claimed she tried to poison her</h2>

      <p>A dwarf who was allegedly abandoned by her adoptive parents when she was nine has denied claims she tried to poison her mum with bleach.</p>
      <p>Natalia Grace Barnett has hit back at claims by her former parents Kristine and Michael Barnett that she was an adult posing as a child when they took her in.</p>
      <p>The Barnetts allege Natalia tried to kill the family after moving into their home and was 22-years-old when they left her, although she claimed to be just a child.</p>
      <p>But the Ukrainian has denied the accusations in an extraordinary interview with US TV star Dr Phil. </p>

      <p>During the episode the host shows Natalia a clip of Ms Barnett claiming her adoptive daughter tried to spray bleach into her coffee while they were cleaning together.</p>
      <p>He added that the American mother said she had video evidence of Natalia's bid to poison her.</p>
      <p>However, the Ukrainian told Dr Phil: "It was Lemon Pledge for tables.</p>
      <p>"We had missed a spot so what I did was I scooted the chair over so I could get there and I scooted her coffee back so I could grab the thing because it was in front of it.</p>
      <p>"So I scooted it back and I grabbed it. She came back and was like 'what are you doing?'.</p>
      <p>"She claimed I tried to spray it in her coffee, you can look in her coffee - there was nothing."</p>

      <p>She also denied her former mum's claim that she had already started her period - and was trying to cover it up - when she was adopted.</p>
      <p>Natalia, who now claims to be 16-years-old, said Ms Barnett had not mentioned anything about bloody clothing to her, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7661425/Ukrainian-dwarf-abandoned-adoptive-parents-denies-claims-masquerading-child.html">Mail Online</a> reports.</p>
      <p>Cynthia Mans, her new adoptive mum who sat alongside her when she met Dr Phil, added: "She's been with us for almost seven years, to this day she does not have a menstrual cycle. Not one."</p>
      <p>Mrs Mans and her husband Antwon, who also took part in the interview, described Natalia as a 'genuine and loving young lady who has been through a horrible situation'.</p>

      <p>They accused the Barnetts of lying and called for them to be punished for dumping their daughter in an apartment and moving to Canada.</p>
      <p>The Barnettsm who were arrested for child abuse in September, adopted Natalia in 2010, when they thought she was six-years-old, before allegedly abandoning her in 2013.</p>
      <p>Responding to the Barnetts' allegations that she was an adult, Natalia told Dr Phil: "It's not true.</p>
      <p>"It's not true at all. I just want people to hear my side."</p>

      <p>Her new adoptive mum Cynthia Mans, who sat alongside her for the interview, said her daughter had bone scans which prove her real age.</p>
      <p>The Barnetts previously claimed a bone scan they paid for indicated she was born in 1989,  <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7648677/Ukrainian-dwarf-abandoned-adoptive-parents-breaks-silence-TV-interview.html">Mail Online</a>  reports.</p>
      <p>Ms Barnett also said doctors examined Natalia and concluded she was suffering a severe psychological illness only diagnosed in adults.</p>
      <p>This illness supposedly led to her jumping from moving cars and smearing blood over mirrors.</p>
      <p>The couple had Natalia's age changed to 22 and later rented an apartment in Lafayette, Indiana, in 2013 and left her there alone, according to police.</p>
