      <p>Blood found on the fridge of a man accused of murdering Grace Millane was 500,000 million times more likely to belong to her than anyone else, a court heard.</p>
      <p>The young woman from Wickford, Essex, went on date with a 27-year-old she met on Tinder in Auckland, New Zealand on December 1, 2018.</p>
      <p>The Crown has alleged that the defendant, who cannot be named due to a suppression order, strangled her and shoved her body inside a suitcase before burying her in a forested area outside the city.</p>
      <p>Today the court heard details of forensic examinations carried out in the CityLife hotel room the accused was staying at, including its fridge.</p>

      <p>The defence claims the death, on either December 1 or December 2, the date of Grace's 22nd birthday, was accidental and occurred during rough sexual intercourse.</p>
      <p>Forensic experts told Auckland High Court on Friday there was evidence Grace's blood had been cleaned up, which the defendant told police he had done.</p>
      <p>Scientist Dianne Crenfeldt told the jury she had found two approximately circular probable blood stains.</p>
      <p>She said they were found between the bed and a wardrobe where the man accused of Grace's murder was staying.</p>

      <p>DNA expert Turlough Thomas-Stone said "no male DNA was detected" in samples taken from the woman's fingernails and from the suitcase in which her body was found.</p>
      <p>But he added that "damp, moisture, exposure to the elements" can make it harder to identify DNA samples taken from gravesites.</p>
      <p>"Given the time between the alleged event and the taking of these samples, that could be a potential explanation (for the absence of male DNA)," he added.</p>
      <p>Toxicologist Diana Kappatos said testing showed no illicit or prescribed drugs and the presence of 106 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood in the deceased's body, double the legal limit for drivers in New Zealand.</p>

      <p>But Ms Kappatos said microbial action after death may have increased or decreased the concentration of alcohol in Grace's body.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, jurors were shown security footage of the young woman and the defendant as they drank at various bars throughout the city.</p>
      <p>Grace's friend, Ameena Ashcroft, said in a letter read to the court that she "thought something was out of place" when the young woman sent a series of messages during the date.</p>
      <p>The backpacker said she wanted to "get smashed" with the man she met on Tinder.</p>

      <p>Security footage showed the pair kiss repeatedly at the Bluestone Room before walking arm-in-arm a short distance into the lobby of the CityHigh hotel where the defendant was staying.</p>
      <p>Grace was shown to follow the defendant out of the lift at 9.41pm.</p>
      <p>It was the last time she was seen alive.</p>
      <p>The trial, which is expected to last for another four weeks, is due to continue on Monday.</p>
