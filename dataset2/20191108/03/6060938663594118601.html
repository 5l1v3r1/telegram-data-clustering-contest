      <p>The buzz about <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Farah-Khan">Farah Khan</a> making a remake of a cult classic film, '<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Satte-Pe-Satta">Satte Pe Satta</a>' has already got everyone by surprise. Fans of the original film, 'Satte Pe Satta' are waiting for this film with bated breath and why not? the remake will see a fresh pairing in Bollywood with <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Hrithik-Roshan">Hrithik Roshan</a> and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Anushka-Sharma">Anushka Sharma</a> stepping into <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Amitabh-Bachchan">Amitabh Bachchan</a> and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Hema-Malini">Hema Malini</a>'s shoe. Today, we came across yet another interesting update about Anushka's character in the film.</p>
      <p>According to a media report, while the original film featured Hema Malini playing a nurse's character, director Farah Khan has taken some liberties and have changed the profession of the leading actress from a nurse to a teacher. Accordingly, now Anushka will play a teacher. Moreover, Farah is taking inspiration from her own directorial debut film 'Main Hoon Naa'. She will showcase Anushka as a glamourous teacher similar to the lines of Sushmita's character Miss Chandni from 'MHN'. However, instead of sarees, Anushka will flaunt short jackets and summer dresses. Wow! sounds interesting.</p>
      <p>It was also reported that the celebrated role of Ranjeeta's character will be portrayed by Bollywood's dimpled girl Preity Zinta. With this Hrithik and Preity will collaborate for a film after 'Mission Kashmir' and 'Lakshya'.</p>
      <p>With all such interesting updates flowing in, we are already excited to see this Hrithik and Anushka's 'Satte Pe Satta' remake.</p>
