      <h1>Work-Life Balance: After Cryptographer's Lawsuit, BAE Division Will Retrain HR</h1>

      <p>Longtime Slashdot reader <a href="https://yro.slashdot.org/~mdecerbo">mdecerbo</a> writes: <i>Back in 2015, defense giant BAE Systems <a href="https://it.slashdot.org/story/17/03/14/041223/work-life-balance-cryptographer-fired-by-bae-systems-for-taking-care-of-dying-wife">fired cryptographer Don Davis on his first day of work</a>, after learning he didn't want to work more than 40 hours a week while caring for his dying wife. Davis filed a federal lawsuit, and the Boston Globe <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/03/13/the-soullessness-machine/rpljPWdV7gSVlBdMoygDXP/story.html">suggested that the company should settle it</a> rather than try to defend the "soullessness of the machine."<br/><br/>It's unusual for the public to hear anything about settlements of lawsuits like this; they're usually kept confidential to avoid publicity. So it's remarkable that BAE and Davis have now <a href="http://world.std.com/~dtd/BAE.html">issued a joint statement</a> that the lawsuit is resolved, with one division of BAE announcing that they will retrain their HR staff about male employees with caregiving responsibilities. Maybe one part of the machine has gotten a little less soulless. Could this become a trend, where tech companies have to actually let employees have some sort of a life?</i></p>
