      <p>PROPINE, a Singapore-based startup providing services for digital securities, was admitted into the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s (MAS) FinTech Regulatory Sandbox and granted a conditional licence on Friday.</p>
      <p>Propine acts as a custodian for blockchain-based digital assets. It offers a full range of services for institutions, such as custody, asset servicing, trade settlement, entitlement checks, investor reporting, cap table management, statutory reconciliations and regulatory reporting.</p>
      <p>The startup’s sandbox admission on Friday comes after it raised US$1.17 million in seed funding last November. Participating investors in that round included Singapore’s Decacorn Capital, SGInnovate, LuneX (the cryptocurrency-focused arm of Golden Gate Ventures), and MTZ Holdings.</p>
      <p>The MAS regulatory sandbox allows financial institutions and fintech startups to experiment with financial products or services in a supportive environment. It also includes safeguards to contain the consequences of failure and maintain the overall soundness of the financial system.</p>
      <p>Tuhina Singh, chief executive officer and co-founder of Propine, said on Friday: “The sandbox is a major milestone for us as we move into a more organised and regulated world for blockchain.”</p>
