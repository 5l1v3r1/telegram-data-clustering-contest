      <p>NEW YORK, Nov 8 — Walt Disney Co’s theme parks and a remake of “The Lion King” boosted quarterly earnings past Wall Street targets yesterday as costs came in lower than expected for its big plunge into streaming entertainment.</p>
      <p>Shares of Disney rose more than 5 per cent to US$140.77 (RM581.80) in after-hours trading.</p>
      <p>Disney is trying to transition from a cable TV leader to a powerhouse in the streaming video market dominated by Netflix Inc Its family-friendly digital entertainment service, Disney+, is set to debut on Tuesday. Subscribers can access the programming through Apple Inc, Alphabet Inc’s Google, Microsoft Corp, Sony Corp and Roku Inc.</p>
      <p>Disney+ will launch in western Europe, including the United Kingdom, on March 31.</p>
      <p>Excluding certain items, Disney earned US$1.07 per share for the quarter that ended in September, above average analyst estimates of 95 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger said the company had reached a deal to have Disney+ distributed on Amazon.com Inc’s Fire TV devices as well as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and LG Electronics Inc devices.</p>
      <p>Investments to build streaming media services increased form a year earlier. The direct-to-consumer and international unit reported an operating loss of US$740 million from July through September, up from US$340 million the previous year, but less than the US$900 million that Disney had forecast.</p>
      <p>Disney+ will offer a deep library of TV shows and movies from Disney, Pixar Animation, Marvel Studios, the <i>Star Wars</i> franchise and the National Geographic Channel, plus original programming such as a new <i>High School Musical</i> series and a remake of <i>Lady and the Tramp</i>. It will cost US$7 per month, less than the US$13 for Netflix’s most popular plan.</p>
      <p>The offering is a cornerstone of a major shift in Disney’s strategy to capture audiences that have ditched cable and migrated online. The company also offers ESPN+, which streams sports not seen on the ESPN cable channel, and recently took full control of online video service Hulu.</p>
      <p>Hulu will become the official streaming home for Disney’s FX Networks starting in March, the company said.</p>
      <p>At the same time, Disney is integrating film and TV businesses it purchased from 21st Century Fox to feed its digital ambition.</p>
      <p>At the theme parks and consumer products unit, operating income rose 17 per cent to US$1.4 billion. Disney opened a costly <i>Star Wars</i>-themed land at Walt Disney World in Florida during the quarter. A nearly identical section debuted at Disneyland in California in May.</p>
      <p>The movie studio benefited from remakes of <i>The Lion King</i> and <i>Aladdin</i> plus Pixar sequel <i>Toy Story 4</i>. Profit at the division jumped 79 per cent to nearly US$1.1 billion.</p>
      <p>The company’s media networks division posted a 3 per cent decrease in operating income to US$1.8 billion, Disney said. Sports network ESPN experienced higher programming, production and marketing costs and now has 3.5 million subscribers.</p>
      <p>Overall revenue rose 34 per cent to US$19.10 billion, edging past analysts’ average estimate of US$19.05 billion. — Reuters</p>
