      <p>â€‹New York Attorney Letitia James filed a lawsuit against the Donald J. Trump Foundation in June 2018, arguing that the organization <a href="https://sputniknews.com/analysis/201806201065585622-trump-clinton-foundation/">used charity funds</a> for Trump's own personal, business and political interests such as the 2016 presidential campaign.</p>
      <p>As part of the settlement, Trump has admitted to <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201812191070832321-trump-hillary-clinton-foundation/">misusing Trump Foundation funds</a> and has agreed to restrictions on future charitable service and constant reporting to the New York Attorney General if he creates a new charity.</p>
      <p>In addition, the office of New York Attorney Letitia James <a href="https://sputniknews.com/cartoons/201812191070804323-trump-foundation-agrees-dissolve-business/">said earlier on Thursday</a> the settlement requires mandatory training for Trump's children, Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump and Eric Trump in order to ensure this type of illegal activity does not happen again.</p>
