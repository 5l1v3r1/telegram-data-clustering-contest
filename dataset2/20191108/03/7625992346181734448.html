      <h1>Kanye West announces plans to move Yeezy manufacturing to the Americas</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T03:24:50+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 03:24</time> by <a rel="author">Jordan Freiman</a></address>
      <p>Kanye West announced plans Thursday to move all manufacturing of his Yeezy shoe brand to the Americas within the next two years. Speaking at Fast Company's Innovation Festival, West <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfG8qlhW04">detailed his future plans</a> for the company as well as a possible run for president in 2024.</p>
      <p>"Within the next two years our goal is to bring the manufacturing back to America," <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jesus-is-king-kanye-west-has-finally-dropped-album-after-taking-fans-on-a-journey-surprise-sunday-service-new-york-city/">the rapper </a>said. "South America, North America. Bring it back stateside, and also to present jobs for people back here."</p>
      <p>West said he is moving Yeezy headquarters to his 4,000 acre ranch in Cody, Wyoming. There, he plans to make environmentally sustainable shoes using a "seed-to-sole" process involving the hydroponic production of hemp and cotton.</p>
      <p>Steven Smith, Yeezy's lead designer, then unveiled a shoe that had been manufactured in Atlanta and was partially made using a foam that was created from algae harvested from ponds.</p>
      <p>West also vowed to find more sustainable ways to dye his products. "Our color is a big signature of the brand," West explained. "But also dyeing is one of the main things that's impacting the planet in the fashion industry. So, just being responsible from A to Z."</p>
      <p>Later in the talk, West used his optimistic outlook of how many people the proposed relocation would employ to <a href="https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/988984329295441921">reiterate</a> his intention to run for president in 2024. The crowd seemed unsure of how seriously to take him.</p>
      <p>"When I run for president in 2024," West started, but then paused when the room broke into scattered laughter. West quieted the audience momentarily by asking, "What are y'all laughing at?"</p>
      <p>"When I run for president in 2024," he repeated, prompting more laughter, "we would have created so many jobs, I'm not gonna run. I'm gonna walk."</p>
