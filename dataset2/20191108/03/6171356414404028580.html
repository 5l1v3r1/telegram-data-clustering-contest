      <h1>LineageOS now supports Zenfone 3, Yandex Phone, and other devices</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T03:08:42+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 03:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/corbin-davenport/" target="_blank">Corbin Davenport</a></address>
      <p>It has been a little while since we've checked in on LineageOS, the super-popular custom ROM that brings new versions of Android to old phones. <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/09/17/lineageos-brings-back-support-for-xiaomi-phones-updates-more-devices-to-pie/">Last time we covered the project</a>, it fixed an issue that prevented Xiaomi device support, and LineageOS hasn't skipped a beat since then.</p>
      <p>First, there has been one device removal â€” the YU Yuphoria (<a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/lettuce">lettuce</a>) is no longer receiving LineageOS 16.0 builds. It was only added <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/07/27/lineageos-drops-support-for-nexus-4-and-galaxy-s9-starts-builds-for-redmi-note-7-pro/">back in July</a>, and there wasn't an explanation for the removal in <a href="https://github.com/LineageOS/hudson/commit/2b50ec4cdfbafcf65c1495664c9dc54b39fc5f02">the code commit</a>.</p>
      <p>Withour further ado, here are all the new devices now supported by LineageOS 16.0:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Asus Zenfone 3 (<a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/zenfone3">zenfone3</a>)</li>
        <li>Yandex Phone (<a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/Amber">amber</a>)</li>
        <li>Samsung Galaxy S III Neo (Samsung Camera) (<a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/s3ve3gjv">s3ve3gjv</a>)</li>
        <li>Samsung Galaxy S III Neo (Sony Camera) (<a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/s3ve3gxx">s3ve3gxx</a>)</li>
        <li>Sony Xperia Z3 Compact (<a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/z3c">z3c</a>)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 (<a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/mido">mido</a>) was also re-added to the build roster recently, after being removed (along with many other Xiaomi phones) <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/08/12/lineageos-brings-pie-to-13-more-phones-temporarily-halts-all-xiaomi-support/">a few months ago</a>, due to copyright issues with the proprietary blobs being used. As always, you can find more information about each device's builds by following the links.</p>
