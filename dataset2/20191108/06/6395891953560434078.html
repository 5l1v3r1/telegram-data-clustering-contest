      <p>In August 2017, officers said <a href="https://www.fox13memphis.com/top-stories/memphis-father-indicted-after-4-year-old-daughter-kills-8-year-old-brother/1006101051">Cordero Wilhite</a>, 30, was in his bedroom when his two children came in and got on the bed with him. He told investigators he had a pistol that he put under the covers so his children wouldn't see.</p>
      <p>Eventually, his daughter found and discharged the gun, striking her brother Deaundre Shannon, 8, in the chest and killing him.</p>
      <p>His daughter was 4 years old at the time of the shooting.</p>
      <p>Wilhite was also indicted for felony drug charges that involved more than a pound of marijuana. The drugs were found in his home in the 1000 block of Parkland Rd., west of the Sherwood Forest neighborhood.</p>
      <p>Wilhite is currently free on a $50,000 bond.</p>
