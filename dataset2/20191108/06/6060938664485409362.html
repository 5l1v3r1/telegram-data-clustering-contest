      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Saif-Ali-Khan">Saif Ali Khan</a> and Amrita Singh’s marriage and divorce, both made big headlines then. The estranged couple has moved on and are happy in their respective lives. While Amrita has mostly refrained from talking about Saif or their relationship, Saif has often been vocal about it. The actor recently opened up about his <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ex-wife">ex wife</a> and her contribution in the success of his career in Hindi film industry. Speaking about the same, he ran away from home, and got married at 20. According to the actor, Amrita was only the only person who taught him to take it his work seriously.</p>
      <p>Saif also added how she was the one who told him to believe in himself when he was clueless about how to approach his character in ‘Dil Chahta Hai’. When he was asking everybody as to how he should approach and treat his character in the film, Amrita asked him why is he even asking others how to play the role. He should do his own thing. And that is what exactly Saif did and made Sameer one of the most adored characters in modern Hindi cinema.</p>
      <p>Saif and Amrita are proud parents to two of their now grown-up kids – Sara and Ibrahim. Saif is now married to <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kareena-Kapoor">Kareena Kapoor</a> Khan with whom he has a kid – <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Taimur-Ali-Khan">Taimur Ali Khan</a>.</p>
      <p>On the work front, Saif will next be seen in Nitin Kakkar’s ‘Jawaani Jaaneman’ where he will be seen reuniting with his ‘Hum Saath Saath Hai’ co-star Tabu. The film also stars debutant Alaia F.</p>
      <p>He will also be seen in ‘Bhoot Police’ which also stars Fatima Sana Shaikh and Ali Fazal</p>
