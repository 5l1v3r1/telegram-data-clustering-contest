      <p>REUTERS: Videogame publisher Take-Two Interactive Software Inc forecast holiday-quarter revenue below expectations, as console-based titles face stiff competition from online free-to-play games that attract a more younger audience.</p>
      <p>The company's shares fell about 2per cent to US$114.70 in after-market trading.</p>

      <p>The tepid forecast overshadowed a better-than-expected second quarter adjusted revenue, boosted by the success of its flagship basketball game "NBA 2K20", "Borderlands 3" and "Red Dead Redemption 2".</p>
      <p>"NBA 2K20" and "Borderlands 3", the latest installment in the popular first-person shooter series that launched in September, are among the best-selling games of this year, according to research firm NPD.</p>
      <p>"Borderlands 3" sold nearly 7 million units worldwide since its launch, the company said on the post-earnings conference call.</p>
      <p>The company, behind franchises like "Grand Theft Auto V" and "Red Dead Redemption 2", forecast third-quarter adjusted revenue between US$860.0 million (Â£670.98 million) and US$910.0 million, below analysts' estimates of US$928.1 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>For the full year, the company expects adjusted revenue between US$2.75 billion and US$2.85 billion, compared to estimates of US$2.80 billion.</p>
      <p>The forecast comes at a time when console-based game franchises are competing with mobile-based, free-to-play games with engaging formats, which are challenging the dominance of traditional publishers like Take-Two and its rivals Activision Blizzard Inc and Electronic Arts Inc .</p>
      <p>On an adjusted basis, Take-Two reported a revenue of US$950.5 million in the second quarter ended Sept. 30, beating estimates of US$925.6 million.</p>
      <p>Net income rose to US$71.8 million, or 63 cents per share, from US$25.4 million, or 22 cents per share, a year earlier.</p>
