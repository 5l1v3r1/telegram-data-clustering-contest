      <p>Eleanor Tomlinson says she auditioned for a role in Peaky Blinders, but was not successful because she could not do a Birmingham accent.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old is best known for playing Demelza in the BBC series Poldark, which was based on the books of the same name penned by Winston Graham.</p>
      <p>She told The Jonathan Ross Show: “I auditioned for Peaky Blinders when it was first starting, but they said ‘You need to be able to do a Birmingham accent’. I tried and they said ‘You just can’t do it can you love’. I was like ‘Oh okay’.”</p>

      <p>Gangster drama Peaky Blinders stars Cillian Murphy as Tommy Shelby in the gritty series about a Birmingham crime family.</p>
      <p>The fifth and final series of Poldark, which saw Tomlinson star alongside Aidan Turner, aired this year.</p>
      <p>Asked about a reunion with the cast, she told the ITV show: “The whole cast and crew on it were amazing, I will miss it a lot, but it’s time to do something else.</p>
      <p>“It’s exciting. It’s opened lots of doors. It will always have a very fond place in my heart. Aidan is always off gallivanting around the world, so I haven’t caught up with him in ages but we are good mates.</p>

      <p>“You never say never… I kept the corset from Poldark, just because it was so painful and I wanted to never have to wear it again but to own it and think ‘I got through it, I wore it every day’.</p>
      <p>“Now I can eat a burger and chips and be able to enjoy as opposed to not be able to finish it. I wouldn’t say no (to a reunion] we’ll see. It would be lovely to do a reunion, it would be amazing.”</p>
      <p>She will next be seen on screen in the BBC adaptation of HG Wells’s famous sci-fi novel, The War Of The Worlds.</p>

      <p>She told Ross: “It’s the same production that make Poldark so I’d been working with them for a few years. I just read the script and absolutely loved it. I loved this character. It was a high action bit of fun. Something different. An amazing cast…</p>
      <p>“The costume was amazing. It was pretty heavy though. There was a scene set in the sea, it was actually filmed in a big swimming pool. I had to dive in and I had to swim to save this child.</p>
      <p>“That costume when it gets wet, let me tell you, I was like a lead balloon and I just went completely down and ended up sitting on the bottom of the pool just waiting for this diving team to come and rescue me and thinking ‘Oh gosh I think I might die here, this is quite strange’. Then sure enough, there they were.”</p>
      <p>The series sees Tomlinson and Spall playing a couple who start a life together against the backdrop of an alien invasion.</p>
      <p>The Jonathan Ross Show airs on Saturday at 10pm on ITV.</p>
