      <p>Massachusetts authorities say a Buffalo Wild Wings employee has died and at least 10 people have been hospitalized following a chemical mixture at the restaurant.</p>
      <p>WHDH-TV <a href="https://whdh.com/news/1-employee-dead-6-hospitalized-following-chemical-incident-at-burlington-buffalo-wild-wings/">reports</a> officials responding Thursday night to reports of a chemical reaction in the kitchen area found a male employee suffering from nausea. Burlington police say they think he inhaled fumes from a cleaning agent.</p>
      <p>The employee, whose name wasn’t immediately released, was taken to a hospital where he later died. Authorities evacuated the restaurant and urged anyone who was inside at the time to get medical treatment, if needed.</p>
      <p>A Buffalo Wild Wings statement says the company is “shocked and saddened” and working with the franchisee and authorities.</p>
      <p>The suburban Boston sports bar will remain closed while the investigation continues.</p>
