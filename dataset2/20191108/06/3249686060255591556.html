      <p>On November 8, former <b>Crayon Pop </b>member and current '<b>Afreeca TV</b>' BJ <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/ellin">Ellin</a> appeared in a live broadcast, admitting to her previous 'romance scam' accusations. </p>
      <p>During this broadcast, Ellin stated, <i>"The victim '<b>A</b>' gave me a month's time for a chance to apologize, but I stubbornly did not. I wanted to continue my broadcast activities, and so I responded with hasty lies. I'm sorry."</i></p>
      <p>She continued, <i>"I am truly sorry for worsening the entire situation due to my selfishness. I apologized to 'A' in person, and 'A' gratefully accepted my apologize. We came to terms to refrain from creating any more situations which could damage either side." </i></p>
      <p>Finally, Ellin refuted claims that she was also in a relationship while being involved in the 'romance scam' incident. She revealed, <i>"It's not true that I had a boyfriend at the time. I broke up with an ex-boyfriend before I began my BJ promotions. I know that due to my previous mistakes, my attempt to speak the truth now can also fall under suspicion. But this part is entirely true." </i></p>
      <p>Approximately a week ago, BJ Ellin garnered attention after <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/article/2019/11/ellin-of-crayon-pop-rumored-to-be-streamer-behind-1-billion-won-romance-scam">being accused of scamming</a> a viewer 'A' worth approximately 1 billion KRW (~ 860,000 USD) in 'balloon' gifts via Afreeca TV, luxury gifts including jewelry, shoes, bags, and even fees for a new apartment. Then, on November 2, Ellin denied the accusations, choosing to continue with her live broadcasts. </p>
