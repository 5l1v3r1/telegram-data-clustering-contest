      <h1>Scott McTominay a doubt for Man Utd vs Brighton after injury against Partizan Belgrade</h1>
      <h2>Midfielder has been one of United's best players this season and will be a big miss as Red Devils target vital Premier League points this weekend</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T06:17:31+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 06:17</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Scott McTominay could be missing for Manchester United's Premier League clash against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> at the weekend after suffering an injury against Partizan Belgrade.</p>
      <p>McTominay limped off the field with 15 minutes remaining as United secured a place in the last 32 of the Europa League with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/manchester-united-3-0-partizan-20836060">Thursday's 3-0 win</a> at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>The Scottish midfielder had been left slumped on the turf clutching his ankle following a challenge from Partizan's Aleksandar Scekic. He tried to play on but was replaced by Jesse Lingard three minutes later.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/scott-mctominay">McTominay</a>, 22, has been one of United's best performers during the club's worst start to a league season for 33 years, and he will be a big miss for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side if he is ruled out of Sunday's clash at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>Having secured their place in the knockout stages of the Europa League, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">United</a> desperately need a win over Brighton as they look to rise up the Premier League table from their current position of 10th.</p>

      <p>And speaking after Thursday's victory, Red Devils boss Solskjaer admitted he didn't know whether McTominay would recover in time to face Brighton.</p>
      <p>"I don't know how bad it will be," Solskjaer said in quotes reported by <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10301930/manchester-united-scott-mctominay-injury-brighton-solskjaer/">The Sun</a> .</p>
      <p>"He said he was going to be okay, but then he couldn't [carry on] so hopefully he will be okay for Sunday.</p>
      <p>"But I don't know."</p>

      <p>United made light work of Partizan with goals from Mason Greenwood, Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford - although the hosts could have had six by half-time.</p>
      <p>Greenwood showed superb composure to sweep home for the opener at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>Martial doubled the Red Devils' lead in the first half with a stunning solo goal, picking up the loose ball on the edge of the box before gliding past two Partizan defenders and poking home beyond Vladimir Stojkovic.</p>
      <p>Rashford, who formed part of United's three-man attack alongside Martial and Greenwood, later got in on the act in the second half when he smashed home a stunning first-time effort into the roof of the net.</p>
      <p>But he could have had a first-half hat-trick and later both <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/marcus-rashford-says-man-utd-20837732">he and Solskjaer admitted United needed to be more clinical</a> .</p>
