      <p>LAS VEGAS -- A Las Vegas Strip casino is suing San Jose Sharks forward Evander Kane, alleging he failed to repay a US$500,000 gambling debt racked up during a playoff series in Las Vegas last April.</p>
      <p>Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas lawyer Lawrence Semenza III declined Thursday to comment about the civil lawsuit filed Monday against Kane.</p>
      <p>It's not immediately clear if Kane has a lawyer in the case. His representatives couldn't immediately be reached for comment Thursday.</p>
      <p>The lawsuit alleges the 28-year-old Kane, who is a Canadian citizen, received eight casino credits of varying amounts about April 15.</p>
      <p>The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported the date coincides with Games 3 and 4 of a playoff series between the Sharks and the Vegas Golden Knights.</p>
