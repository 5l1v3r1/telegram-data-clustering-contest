      <p>Family and friends of broadcasting giant Gay Byrne will gather in Dublin later to say a final farewell at his funeral.</p>
      <p>He died earlier in the week at the age of 85 after a long illness.</p>
      <p>The former Late Late Show host had been undergoing treatment for cancer.</p>
      <p>He is survived by his wife Kathleen and the couple's two adult daughters.</p>
      <p>A host of well-known names are expected to attend his funeral Mass in St Mary’s Pro Cathedral in Dublin city centre.</p>
      <p>The Archbishop of Dublin Diarmuid Martin will be among the clergy presiding at the service.</p>
      <p>Byrne started his career as a newsreader and continuity announcer on Radio Éireann in the late 1950s before moving to Granada Television in Manchester, where he worked on a variety of shows, interviewing acts including The Beatles.</p>
      <p>For a time he commuted between Dublin and UK, working for both the BBC and RTE, but came back to Ireland full-time in the late 1960s as presenter and producer of The Late Late Show.</p>
      <p>The programme went on to become the world’s longest-running chat show.</p>
      <p>The much-loved host had also presented a long-running radio show on Radio 1, first known as The Gay Byrne Hour and then The Gay Byrne Show.</p>
