      <h1>Wealth of global billionaires fell in 2018 for first time in three years</h1>
      <h2>Excessive wealth has become an increasingly contentious issue globally, with some US presidential candidates making it central to their campaigns</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T06:42:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 06:42</time> by <a rel="author">Emma Vickers | Bloomberg</a></address>
      <p>The world’s billionaires saw their collective fortunes dip in 2018 for the first time in three years, erasing $388 billion of their net worth.</p>
      <p>Asia was hardest hit, as slowing growth in China and rising US interest rates resulted in an 8% <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/wealth">wealth </a>drop among that continent’s richest people, according to the UBS/PwC Billionaires Report released Friday. Those in the US fared better, fueled by tech billionaires who numbered 89 by the end of 2018, up from 70 a year earlier.</p>
      <p>The billionaire boom “has now undergone a natural correction,” Josef Stadler, head of ultra-high net worth at UBS Global <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/wealth">Wealth </a>Management, said in the report. “The stronger dollar, combined with greater uncertainty over equity markets amidst a tough geopolitical environment” were the main drivers, he said.</p>
      <p>Excessive <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/wealth">wealth </a>has become an increasingly contentious issue globally, with some US presidential candidates making it central to their campaigns. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, has proposed a 6% wealth tax on assets over $1 billion, while Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has said that billionaires shouldn’t exist at all. Beyond Washington, protests from Hong Kong to France are seeking a reckoning for the rich, citing decades of inequality as a cause of their frustration.</p>
      <p>Stock markets have bounced back since 2018, with the MSCI All-Country World Index up 20%CK so far in 2019. And even with last year’s dip, billionaires’ wealth increased almost 35% -- or $2.2 trillion -- since 2013, according to the report.</p>
      <p>“We’ve seen that these people can be successful and drive change regardless of who’s in a leadership role on the political scene,” said John Mathews, who oversees UBS Group AG’s private wealth and ultra-high net-worth business in the Americas.</p>
