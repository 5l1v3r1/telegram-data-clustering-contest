      <p><b>OAKLAND, Calif.Â (AP)</b> - Philip Rivers had one drive to salvage an up-and-down performance and end his final scheduled trip to the Oakland Coliseum on a winning note.</p>
      <p>Six straight incomplete passes followed by his third interception of the game ended those chances and dealt a serious blow to the Los Angeles Chargers' playoff hopes.</p>
      <p>Rivers threw interceptions on his first two drives to put the Chargers in an early hole and then again on his final pass to seal the Oakland Raiders' 26-24 victory over Los Angeles on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>"You give a team 10 points at their place and then you have the ball with a chance to win at the end and you have eight snaps and go nowhere, it's going to be tough to win," Rivers said.</p>
      <p>Now it will be tough for the Chargers (4-6) to make the playoffs. They fell to seventh place in the AFC wild-card chase and can ill afford many more slipups if they want to get back to the postseason.</p>
      <p>"That's probably the most upsetting thing about this is we can't afford another loss," said running back Melvin Gordon, who ran for 108 yards and a TD. "Have to play our best football, which isn't impossible, but we have to get some guys back and try to make this move."</p>
      <p>A win against the Raiders (5-4) would have gone a long way to helping those chances, and Rivers was hopeful of delivering it at one of his favorite road venues.</p>
      <p>Rivers made his NFL starting debut at the Coliseum and has the most wins (nine), yards passing (3,705) and TD passes (26) of any visiting quarterback in Oakland.</p>
      <p>An errant pass to Keenan Allen that Erik Harris intercepted on the first drive of the game also gave Rivers the most interceptions with 11, breaking a tie with Joe Namath.</p>
      <p>Rivers was off-target again on the second drive thanks to heavy pressure from the Raiders defense, and Harris returned that one 56 yards for a TD that made it 10-0 Oakland.</p>
      <p>Rivers and the Chargers settled down from there as he capped a 16-play drive with a 2-yard touchdown to Hunter Henry. Gordon added another touchdown.</p>
      <p>Rivers led a go-ahead drive in the fourth quarter capped by a 6-yard TD pass Austin Ekeler with 4:02 remaining, but the defense couldn't hold the lead, allowing Derek Carr and the Raiders to drive 75 yards capped by Josh Jacobs' 18-yard run with 1:02 to play.</p>
      <p>When Daniel Carlson missed the extra point to keep the score 26-24, that left plenty of time for Rivers to engineer a winning drive for a field goal.</p>
      <p>He threw three straight incomplete passes to start it off, only to get bailed out by a fourth-down holding call on Trayvon Mullen. That only prolonged the agony as Rivers threw three more incomplete passes as the Chargers didn't get the ball to Gordon at all on a night where he was the most effective option despite having all three timeouts.</p>
      <p>"We were trying to move the ball downfield," coach Anthony Lynn said. "We needed to score. They did a heck of a job. They locked us up. We had eight shots, I don't think we gained one yard. Put ourselves in position to win at the end. We didn't stop anybody and we didn't make any plays on offense. It's disappointing."</p>
      <p>Then Rivers' night ended when his last-gasp pass to Allen was intercepted by Karl Joseph, setting off a wild celebration at the Coliseum.</p>
      <p>"It was not the way you want to end your time coming here," he said. "It's one of the last-standing, one of the last few active old school NFL stadiums, kind of one of the originals. The atmosphere tonight was awesome."</p>
