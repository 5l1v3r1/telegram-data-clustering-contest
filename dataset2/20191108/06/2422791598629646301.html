      <p>SEATTLE -- Another day, another bleak injury update from Jozy Altidore.</p>
      <p>"I haven't played any soccer in a month. So that's where I'm at," the Toronto FC striker said with a exasperated chuckle Thursday when asked about his recovery from a quad strain suffered in the regular-season finale Oct. 6 against Columbus. "I'm trying to jog and trying to change pace and trying to do those type of things. But like I said I have to let the muscle heal first or else you put yourself at risk.</p>
      <p>"I'm not telling you no false truths or nothing like that. I'm actually being very candid. That's where I am. I'm not happy about it but it is what it is."</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, Altidore said he needed "a little bit of a miracle" to see action in Sunday's MLS Cup final against Seattle.</p>
      <p>"I should never have used that word," Altidore said, drawing laughs. "Now you're all doing this to me."</p>
      <p>The injury occurred when Altidore took a shot and his foot hit a sliding Jonathan Mensah's leg, causing him to lose his balance and hit the turf at BMO Field.</p>
      <p>"I still have to progress. There's still things like kicking the ball," he said with a quick laugh. "I know it sounds silly but there are still things that I have to do that with this kind of injury are tricky. I'm trying my very best. I'm doing everything I can.</p>
      <p>"We're all hoping, I'm hoping to obviously play some sort of part in the game."</p>
      <p>Spanish playmaker Alejandro Pozuelo has been pushed farther up front in Altidore's absence in the playoffs.</p>
