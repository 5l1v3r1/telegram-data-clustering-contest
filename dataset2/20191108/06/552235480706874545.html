      <h2>Diane Gillan contracted sepsis and almost died last year - now she's set for a sixth SO appearance</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T06:00:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Thomson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/paul-thomson/</a></address>
      <p>Whitehills badminton ace Diane Gillan hopes to be fit enough to go for gold at the 2021 Special Olympics after her brush with death last year.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old is still recovering from the after-effects of sepsis, which almost killed her in December 2018.</p>
      <p>The News reported how the multiple East Kilbride and South Lanarkshire Disability Sports Award winner suffered a reaction to an anti-inflammatory drug that led to her contracting the blood infection.</p>
      <p>She pulled through after weeks of treatment and now Diane, who has autism, has received a sporting boost after being selected for the Special Olympics.</p>
      <p>Diane will represent the West of Scotland at the Games in Liverpool, for what will be her sixth Special Olympics.</p>
      <p>And she said: “I’m just really pleased to be playing again.</p>
      <p>“I had sepsis last year and nearly died, so I’m over the moon to be picked for the Special Olympics again.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been trying to get back to full fitness since the sepsis, but it’s been difficult.</p>
      <p>“There’s been problems with my blood and my folic acid levels.</p>

      <p>“It’s taken a lot out of my body and I am fighting the tiredness every day.</p>
      <p>“But I’ve got plenty of time to get better and it will give me something to work towards and focus on.”</p>
      <p>Diane will compete in the ladies singles, ladies doubles and mixed doubles events in Liverpool and is desperate to add to her collection of medals.</p>
      <p>She said: “I’ve always come away with at least a gold before, so I’m going for another one hopefully.</p>
      <p>“This time it would be pretty special to win gold after the last year.</p>
      <p>“I’ve competed in a few competitions and after having sepsis I won three golds at the Scottish Championships and won gold in the mixed doubles at the Four Nations, so hopefully I’m feeling good at the Special Olympics.”</p>
