      <p>Tiger Woods has become the first Presidents Cup captain to use a wild-card selection on himself.</p>
      <p>He will also become only the second playing captain in the Presidents Cup, after Hale Irwin did so in the inaugural matches 25  years ago.</p>
      <p>Since returning in early 2018 from a fourth surgery on his back, Woods has won three tournaments, including his 15th major when he won the Masters in April.</p>

      <p>“It’s going to be a lot of work, but (it is) something I’ve been looking forward to for a long time,” Woods said.</p>
      <p>In October, Woods equalled the PGA Tour record with his 82nd career victory at the Zozo Championship in Japan.</p>
      <p>He said the trip to Japan – the travel as well as winning – convinced him he was fully healed from knee surgery he had in August and capable of playing in the Presidents Cup, which will be held from December 12-15 at Royal Melbourne in Australia.</p>
      <blockquote>As captain, I’m going to choose Tiger Woods as the last player on the team</blockquote>
      <p>Woods also selected Tony Finau, US Open champion Gary Woodland and Patrick Reed.</p>
      <p>The rest of the US team is Dustin Johnson, Xander Schauffele, Bryson DeChambeau, Justin Thomas, Matt Kuchar, Patrick Cantlay and Webb Simpson.</p>
      <p>That leaves room for one more player, which could be current world No 1 Brooks Koepka, who had stem cell treatment in his left knee after the Tour Championship.</p>

      <p>In announcing himself as his fourth and final pick, Woods said: “As captain, I’m going to choose Tiger Woods as the last player on the team.</p>
      <p>“He’s made … nine Cups and he’s played in Australia twice in the Presidents Cup, so this will be his third appearance as a player.</p>
      <p>“And I find it interesting talking in the third person.”</p>
