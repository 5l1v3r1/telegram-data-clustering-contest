      <p>REUTERS: Gap Inc said on Thursday Chief Executive Officer Art Peck will step down and also cut its full-year earnings forecast, blaming slower traffic and operational challenges, sending the apparel maker's shares down 7per cent.</p>
      <p>Peck's departure comes as Gap prepares to spin off its Old Navy brand, a bright spot for the struggling retailer, into a publicly listed company.</p>

      <p>He has been with Gap for nearly 15 years and will depart after a brief transition, the company said.</p>
      <p>Robert Fisher, the company's current non-executive board chairman, will serve as president and chief executive officer on an interim basis, effective immediately.</p>
      <p>The apparel retailer, which estimated a 4per cent drop in third-quarter same-store sales, now expects full-year adjusted earnings per share of US$1.70 to US$1.75, down from its previous forecast of US$2.05 to US$2.15.</p>
      <p>"This was a challenging quarter, as macro impacts and slower traffic further pressured results that have been hampered by product and operating challenges across key brands," Gap Chief Financial Officer Teri List-Stoll said.</p>
