      <h1>Three New Cast Members Join Showtime’s Halo Series</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T21:54:32+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 21:54</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Abbate</a></address>
      <p>Earlier today, the <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/halo"><b>Halo</b></a> series’ official Twitter account revealed that the show is finally about to start production. Pablo Schreiber (Master Chief) and the cast posed for a picture in that post. However, there were also a few new faces in the picture that weren’t as recognizable…until now. <a href="https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/halo-series-showtime-cast-1203398567/">Variety</a> has new info on Danny Sapani, Olive Gray, and Charlie Murphy’s characters.</p>
      <p>Sapani will play Captain Jacob Keyes, a major character who debuted in <b>Halo: Combat Evolved</b> in 2001. Keyes was a decorated naval officer who commanded the UNSC <i>Pillar of Autumn</i>. Although the Flood absorbed him at the end of <b>Combat Evolved</b>, this wasn’t Keyes’ only appearance in the <b>Halo</b> universe. He showed up in the 2010 prequel <b>Halo: Reach</b>, and writers have explored his backstory in various <b>Halo</b> novels and comics. Sapani’s screen credits include <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/black-panther"><b>Black Panther</b></a>, <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/star-wars-the-last-jedi"><b>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</b></a>, and the E4 series <b>Misfits</b>.</p>

      <p>Gray will co-star as the captain’s daughter, Miranda Keyes. As in the <b>Halo</b> video games, Miranda follows in her father’s footsteps by becoming a UNSC Navy Commander. However, this version of the character is also a doctor who dedicates herself to studying the Covenant. Gray has previously appeared in <b>Fleabag</b>, National Geographic’s <b>Year Million</b>, and BBC’s <b>Dark Money</b> miniseries.</p>
      <p>Finally, Murphy is playing a Makee. This character doesn’t seem to have a counterpart in the games. She’s “an orphaned human who was raised by the alien Covenant and shares their contempt for humanity.” Murphy is best known for playing Jessie Eden on <b>Peaky Blinders</b>. She has also appeared on BBC’s <b>Happy Valley</b> and RTÉ One’s <b>Love/Hate</b>.</p>
