      <p>A transcript of a former National Security Council official’s closed-door testimony revealed how a Republican lawmaker <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/gop-rep-matt-gaetz-ejected-from-secret-impeachment-meeting">was ejected from the impeachment hearing</a>.</p>
      <p>Rep. Matt Gaetz, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, was present when Fiona Hill began her deposition on Oct. 14. The Republican is not a member of the three committees leading the impeachment investigation into President Trump’s conduct toward Ukraine and was noticed by House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff a few minutes into the hearing.</p>
      <p>“Excuse me, could we suspend?” Schiff said, <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IG/IG00/CPRT-116-IG00-D010.pdf">according to the transcript released Friday</a>. “Do we have any members here that are not members of the three committees authorized to be present? Mr. Gaetz, you’re not permitted to be in the room.”</p>
      <p>“I’m on the Judiciary Committee,” Gaetz said.</p>
      <p>“Judiciary Committee is not a part of this hearing,” Schiff responded.</p>
      <p>“I thought the Judiciary Committee Committee had jurisdiction over impeachment,” Gaetz said.</p>
      <p>“Mr. Gaetz, you’re not permitted to be in the room. Please leave,” Schiff replied.</p>
      <p>“Mr. Chairman, really?” Republican Rep. Jim Jordan interjected.</p>
      <p>“Yes, really,” Schiff said.</p>
      <p>“You’re going to include members of Congress on committees that have roles of impeachment — “ Gaetz said.</p>
      <p>“Mr. Gaetz, take your statement to the press. They do no good here. So, please absent yourself,” Schiff said.</p>
      <p>“You’re going to have someone remove me from the hearing?” Gaetz shot back.</p>
      <p>“You’re going to remove yourself, Mr. Gaetz,” Schiff urged.</p>
      <p>Gaetz then said he had “a right” to be there and asked Schiff to cite the rule that did not permit him to be present. The two argued for several more minutes as to whether Gaetz was allowed to be in the room, with Jordan defending his Republican colleague.</p>
      <p>“Mr. Gaetz, why don’t you take your spectacle outside? This is not how we conduct ourselves in this committee,” Schiff said.</p>
      <p>“I’ve seen how you’ve conducted yourself in this committee, and I’d like to be here to observe,” Gaetz said.</p>
      <p>Schiff said the hearing would not continue until Gaetz left the room, and the time used up by the Republican congressman would be taken from the minority’s time for questioning. Gaetz left the room shortly after.</p>
