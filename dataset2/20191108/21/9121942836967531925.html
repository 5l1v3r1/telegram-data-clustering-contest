      <p>McKinley Wright IV scored 17 points, Tyler Bey had 15 points and 12 rebounds, and Colorado pulled away to beat short-handed Arizona State 81-71 in Shanghai on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Sun Devils and Buffaloes opened the season in Shanghai for the fifth year of the Pac-12’s Global Initiative. Though they’re conference teams, the game did not count in the Pac-12 standings.</p>
      <p>Arizona State was at a disadvantage before it ever started, playing without forwards Romello White and Taeshon Cherry for violating team rules prior to the China trip.</p>
      <p>Colorado took advantage by working the ball inside and getting to the rim early while building a 17-point lead.</p>
      <p>The Sun Devils revved up their transition game during a big second-half run to tie it, but Colorado pulled away over the final 6½ minutes.</p>
      <p>Wright finished with seven assists and five rebounds.</p>
      <p>Arizona State’s Remy Martin had 23 points, nine rebounds and seven assists. Rob Edwards added 20 points.</p>

      <p>Exploiting Arizona State’s lack of inside presence, the Buffaloes went on a 15-3 run while building a 42-29 halftime lead behind Schwartz’s 13 points. Colorado then stretched it to 17 in the opening minutes of the second half.</p>
      <p>The Sun Devils finally got their up-tempo game going midway through the second half, getting out on the break and hitting 3s in transition during a 15-2 run to pull within 52-51.</p>
      <p>Arizona State tied it and kept Colorado within reach until the Buffaloes used a 7-0 run to stretch the lead back to 10.</p>
      <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
      <p>Arizona State was able to make a run despite having two starting frontcourt players on the bench, but the lack of depth and size were too much to overcome.</p>
      <p>Colorado showed off its depth and versatility to open the season with solid victory in China.</p>
