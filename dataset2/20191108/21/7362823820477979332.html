      <p>An air base in northern <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/iraq">Iraq</a> that houses U.S. troops was struck Friday evening with a barrage of rockets but no one was injured, the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/defense">Pentagon</a> said, as violence continues to mount in parts of the country amid fights with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/terrorism/isis">Islamic State</a> militants and angry anti-government protesters.</p>
      <p>The 17 Katyusha rockets intended for the Iraqi army base in Qayyara appeared to have been fired in Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city some 38 miles south.</p>
      <p>"No Coalition troops were injured," the Pentagon said in a statement. "We appreciate the Iraqi Security Forces immediate response and investigation. Coalition forces are in Iraq at the invitation of the Government of Iraq to defeat ISIS remnants; we will not be deterred by these attacks and maintain the right to defend ourselves.”</p>
      <p>No one has claimed responsibility for the attack, The Associated Press reported.</p>

      <p>The U.S. withdrew from Iraq in 2011 but returned in 2014 to help battle ISIS fighters after the group seized large swaths of the country, including Mosul. The U.S. provided crucial air support as Iraqi forces drove out ISIS in a three-year campaign to retake the territory it lost.</p>

Protesters have complained of high unemployment and poor public services, despite Iraq having the world's fourth-largest oil reserves.</p>
      <p>Protestors recently ransacked and set on fire offices of politicals parties linked to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/iran">Iran</a> and attacked the Iranian Consulate in Karbala.</p>
      <p>American offices have also been targeted. Rockets were recently <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/baghdad-green-zone-rocket-attack">fired at the U.S. Embassy</a> inside the fortified Green Zone in Baghdad.</p>
