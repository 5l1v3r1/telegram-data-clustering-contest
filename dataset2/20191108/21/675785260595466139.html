      <h1>Jurgen Klopp admits Sean Cox return to Anfield will be highlight of Liverpool career</h1>
      <h2>The Liverpool fan makes his first trip back to the stadium after suffering serious injuries in an assault by Roma fans ahead of the Champions League semi-final first leg last year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T21:05:28+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 21:05</time> by <a rel="author">David Maddock, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-maddock/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jurgen-klopp">Jurgen Klopp</a> will welcome Sean Cox to Anfield on Sunday, admitting it will be one of the highlights of his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> career.</p>
      <p>And he has told the fan from Ireland that Reds fans will demonstrate the club anthem is far from just an anthem sung on the club terraces.</p>
      <p>Cox was attacked by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/as-roma">Roma</a> fans before the Champions League semi-final in 2018, and left in coma after suffering brain injuries from the assault.</p>
      <p>But he has shown remarkable resilience to recover slowly from the attack, and now he will return to Anfield for the first time since that night.</p>
      <p>Klopp revealed that the news of the attack was one of his worst moments in football. Yet he says Sunday will be an emotional and joyful occasion.</p>
      <p>“When it happened to Sean it was probably really the lowest point for me in my whole time at Liverpool because that is something that should not happen,” he said.</p>

      <p>“It shouldn’t happen in life and it should not happen around a football game. It happened around a football game.”</p>
      <p>Sean has recovered some speech and has left hospital, but his wife Martina explained there is still a long way to go in his recovery.</p>
      <p>"He finds it very difficult to express himself verbally and, while it seems he can hear and understand more, his speech remains very challenged," Mrs Cox said.</p>
      <p>"It is unlikely that he ever will walk again which is difficult to accept for someone as active as Sean used to be."</p>

      <p>Klopp though, expects Liverpool fans to extend their club anthem to show that Sean will always be welcomed as part of the Anfield family.</p>
      <p>“Coming from a low point, this is one of my highlights since I've been here. How the Liverpool community dealt with it, I hope he feels that,” the manager added.</p>
      <p>“We don't only sing You'll Never Walk Alone - we really live that and in this specific situation it is very important to show that.</p>
      <p>“I really hope they feel that the whole time and they will feel it in the future and we can help him in this recovery. It is so nice and I am really looking forward to it.</p>
      <p>“I hope we can organise for me to see him before the game for a couple of minutes – I really want to.</p>
      <p>“The love for Sean and his family have for this club and football I hope it gave him strength and power in his recovery time – we know it is not finished yet and there is a long way to go – but having that we can give him the opportunity to come back to watch a really big game, and he wants to do that, for me.”</p>
