      <p>Former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has walked out of a Curitiba prison, less than a day after the Supreme Court ruled that a person can be imprisoned only after all the appeals have been exhausted.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of supporters were gathered outside the federal police building in southern city of Curitiba, hoping to catch a glimpse of the popular 74-year-old politician who is appealing against his conviction of corruption and money laundering in connection with the purchase of a beachfront apartment in Sao Paulo state.</p>
      <p>A stage was set up for him to address the crowd.</p>

      <p>Mr da Silva, who is universally known as Lula, tweeted “Lula Free” with a video of himself working out and lifting weights in a gym inside the prison, where he has been detained since April 2018.</p>
      <p>But he could find himself back in prison if his appeals do not go his way.</p>
      <p>It is not yet clear what political role Mr Da Silva will seek to occupy now that he is free.</p>
      <p>The former leader of the leftist Workers’ Party, better known in Brazil by its Portuguese acronym PT, remains a popular figure on the left, whose politicians and voters have ceaselessly called for his release.</p>
      <p>Political analysts believe Mr da Silva could rally the opposition, which has been demoralised by the corruption scandals, impeachment of Mr da Silva’s hand-picked successor, Mr da Silva’s imprisonment and, more recently, a severe beating in the 2018 general elections.</p>
      <p>Aside from his promise to root out corruption and curb violence, far-right President Jair Bolsonaro ran a strong campaign on anti-Workers Party sentiment.</p>
      <p>He won the election with 55% of the vote and was sworn in on January 1.</p>
      <p>Mr da Silva, who governed from 2003 to 2010, had been favoured to win the 2018 presidential election, but his conviction eventually prohibited him from running.</p>
      <p>The former president has said that when free, he would travel around the country rallying opposition.</p>
      <p>Political analysts say he might not immediately enter into frontal opposition with Mr Bolsonaro, seeking instead to influence the next presidential election in 2022.</p>
