      <h1>Stocks lock in weekly gains amid trade optimism</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T21:45:40+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 21:45</time> by <a rel="author">Melissa Quinn</a></address>
      <p>The three major indexes notched solid weekly gains amid optimism about a possible initial trade deal between the United States and China.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended Friday up 6 points, or 0.02%, while the S&amp;P 500 rose 0.25%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.5%.</p>
      <p>Despite the muted day of trading, the S&amp;P 500 marked its fifth straight week of gains, rising 0.9%. The Dow notched a third week of gains, up 1.2%, and the Nasdaq was up 1.1%.</p>
      <p>The winning streaks come at the end of a week of <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/economy/trump-says-he-hasnt-agreed-to-lift-china-tariffs">conflicting messages on the progress</a> made on a phase one trade deal between the U.S. and China.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said the world’s two largest economies agreed to roll back existing tariffs imposed on goods imported from each country in order to reach an initial agreement.</p>
      <p>White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said later Thursday the Trump administration is “very optimistic” a deal will soon be reached.</p>
      <p>But President Trump on Friday suggested a cancellation of the duties was out of the question.</p>
      <p>“They’d like to have a rollback. I haven’t agreed to anything,” he told reporters before departing the White House for Atlanta. “China would like to get somewhat of a rollback, not a complete rollback, because they know I won't do it.”</p>
      <p>The U.S. has imposed tariffs on $360 billion worth of Chinese goods, and another round of 15% levies is set to take effect Dec. 15.</p>
      <p>Trump announced last month the U.S. and China had reached a phase one deal, but the details are still being worked out. As a result of the preliminary agreement, the president called off a planned tariff increase that was scheduled for Oct. 15. Trump said China also agreed to purchase billions of dollars worth of American farm products.</p>
