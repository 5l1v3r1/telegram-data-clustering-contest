      <p>Two of the most outspoken partisans on committees involved with impeachment-related proceedings bickered at length behind closed doors over process issues in a witness deposition, leading one House member to tell his colleague to "shut up."</p>
      <p>North Carolina Republican Rep. <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/thats-what-he-wants-republicans-see-mark-meadows-angling-for-white-house-chief-of-staff">Mark Meadows</a> exploded at California Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell during the <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IG/IG00/CPRT-116-IG00-D011.pdf">Oct. 29 deposition</a> of Army Lt. Col. <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/alexander-vindman-twin-brother-ukrainian-refugees-army-lieutenant-colonels-who-both-now-work-in-trump-white-house">Alexander Vindman,</a> the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council who testified about President Trump's call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and pressure on his foreign counterpart to find political dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden in exchange for releasing military aid to Ukraine.</p>
      <p>House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff didn't like a line of questioning by Steve Castor, the Republican counsel on the House Oversight Committee, which would seemingly force Vindman to name the whistleblower whose complaint sparked the Ukraine investigation.</p>
      <p>“Excuse me. Excuse me. Let me just state this for the record," said Schiff, a California Democrat. "The whistleblower has a statutory right to anonymity. There are concerns about — ”</p>
      <p>Meadows jumped in and demanded a point of order.</p>
      <p>Swalwell scolded Meadows, telling the North Carolina Republican, “Hey, Mr. Meadows, he's the chairman. He finishes.”</p>
      <p>“Mr. Meadows, when I'm finished,” Schiff said.</p>
      <p>Meadows interjected, “I have a point of order.”</p>
      <p>Schiff at this point told him, “Mr. Meadows, you may make your — ,” and Swalwell interrupted Schiff.</p>
      <p>“He's the chairman. He finishes,” Swalwell tells Meadows again.</p>
      <p>Meadows responded, “Shut up.”</p>
      <p>Meadows and Swalwell are two of the more prominent House members in the combined panels investigating the Ukraine issue. Both are cable television regulars, with Meadows one of Trump's staunchest supporters in Congress and Swalwell a leading critic and advocate of impeachment.</p>
