      <p>West Bengal Chief Minister <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/who-is-mamata-banerjee">Mamata Banerjee </a>on Friday said the Centre's move to demonetise high- value currency notes on this day in 2016 was a futile exercise which had a negative impact on the country's economy.</p>
      <p>Banerjee, on the third anniversary of note ban, asserted that she knew from the very beginning that the decision would ruin millions of lives.</p>
      <p>"Today is the third anniversary of #DeMonetisationDisaster. Within minutes of announcement, I had said that it will ruin the economy and the lives of millions. Renowned economists, common people &amp; all experts now agree. Figures from RBI have also shown it was a futile exercise," the chief minister tweeted.</p>
      <p>"Economic disaster started on that day and look where it has reached now. Banks stressed, economy in a complete slump. All affected. From farmers to the young generation to workers to traders, housewives... everyone is affected," she added.</p>
      <p>Banerjee, during her campaign for the Lok Sabha elections, earlier this year, had promised to conduct an investigation into the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/demonetisation">demonetisation </a>drive.</p>
      <p>On the first anniversary of note ban, she had turned her Twitter display picture black in protest.</p>
      <p>On several occasions, the Trinamool Congress supremo alleged that the Narendra Modi government's move was a "big scam" which benefited only a handful of people.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a televised address on November 8, 2016, had announced to the nation that Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes -- 86 per cent of all currency notes in circulation in value -- would cease to be legal tender. Modi had said that the decision was taken to crack down on black money, terror funding and corruption.</p>
