      <p>HALLE, Germany: US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday (Nov 7) laid flowers at a kebab shop and a synagogue in Germany targeted in last month's fatal shooting by a far-right gunman.</p>
      <p>Accompanied by Germany's Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, he left flowers outside the kebab shop, adding to a sea of bouquets and candles there, and exchanged a few words with the owner.</p>

      <p>Deploring the scourge of anti-Semitism, Pompeo also visited the synagogue where he met with members of the Jewish community.</p>
      <p>The suspect in the attack, 27-year-old German Stephan Balliet, had sought to storm the synagogue in the eastern German city of Halle on Yom Kippur, one of the holiest days on the Jewish calendar.</p>
      <p>When he failed, he shot dead a female passerby outside the synagogue, and later gunned down a man in the kebab shop a short distance away.</p>
      <p>Police subsequently captured the Halle suspect after a gun battle that left him wounded.</p>
      <p>America's top diplomat is on a two-day tour of Germany ahead of the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, he was in Leipzig meeting with demonstrators from the 1989 peaceful revolution that brought the communist regime down, and will on Friday give a speech in the German capital.</p>
