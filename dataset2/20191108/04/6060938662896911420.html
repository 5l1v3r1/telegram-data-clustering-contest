      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ileana-D-Cruz">Ileana D'cruz</a> who enjoys a massive fan following on social media, suddenly became the talk of the town with the buzz about her <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/break-up">break-up</a> with boyfriend Andrew Kneebone. The actress recently spoke to a media house and expressed that she is in no mood to get into any serious relationship now and is indeed not ready for love.</p>
      <p>The first huge difference which was noticed by the netizens post her break-up was her social media handles which suddenly started filling up with Ileana's never seen before avatar pictures. The actress in the report also admitted that post her break-up she went to a therapist who helped her come out of the situation. Ileana further shared how falling in love is easy but staying in love is a different thing. She backed it with a reason that having a partner obviously makes one feel happy, calm and secure, but at the same time one's mental health is also of utmost importance and one should also take care of it.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, she said that the whole break-up chapter was a learning experience for her and the incident has made her grow nothing but stronger. She always wanted to come out of it with respect and love for the other person as she never wanted to think anything bad about him. 'Shit happens but life goes on,' she concluded. Ileana wishes all good things for her ex-boyfriend and says that she is in love with herself and in a happy space now.</p>
      <p>Well, that's quite graceful, Ileana!</p>
