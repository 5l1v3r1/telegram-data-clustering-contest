      <p>CHENNAI: N Srinivasan has been taking all kinds of setbacks in his stride over the past few years and the troubled times have only made him stronger. Be it the probe against his IPL franchise <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/ipl-2018-complete-ipl-squad-of-chennai-super-kings/articleshow/62684882.cms">Chennai Super Kings</a> (CSK) or the corruption charges against his son-in-law <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Gurunath">Gurunath</a> Meiyappan, the battle-hardened man has weathered the storm and he is now back in the corridors of power at the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/bcci">Board of Control for Cricket in India</a> (BCCI).</p>
      <p>Srinivasan said that a turnaround was possible because he didn't buckle down to pressure tactics.</p>
      <p>"Cricket was supposed to be a gentleman's game. But the way the onslaught on CSK and me happened, there was only one thread in common: attack Srinivasan. The attack was severe and pointed. We were put under the gun. There was also this one occasion when a senior police officer contacted me and passed on the message from some other authorities: "Ask Srinivasan to step down (as BCCI president) and nothing will happen". But then we chose to resist. It was a natural instinct of mine that I would never buckle down to this pressure tactics," Srinivasan said here.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/India-Cements">India Cements</a> vice-chairman and managing director was delivering the 37th Endowment Lecture on "Leadership in turbulent times" at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras campus here. The lecture was organised by IIT, Madras and Employers' Federation of Southern India.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the students, Srinivasan said that it was important to stay firm in troubled times. "You must recognise the threat which is real and shouldn't try to answer to perceptions and go into shadow boxing. Now, the Committee of Administrators has left and it's history today. BCCI is going back to its regular functioning and our position is sealed," he said.</p>
      <p>The 74-year-old also asked the students to learn from the grit and determination of the Chennai Super Kings side and the team's captain MS Dhoni. "Turbulence can hit anybody. But Dhoni and CSK dealt with it on merit and with cold-blooded focus and it took us to victory. We have always owned the franchise and not the players. That's why the players respect us and wants to give everything for us on the ground," Srinivasan said.</p>
