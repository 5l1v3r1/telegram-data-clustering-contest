      <p>Hideo Kojima's weird baby <i>Death Stranding</i> is days away from release and if it's something you'd like to experience, here are the cheapest copies in Australia.</p>
      <p>Since <a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2019/11/death-stranding-the-kotaku-review">reviews are now live for the game</a>, we have a bit of a better idea about what <i>Death Stranding</i> actually entails. You're Sam Porter Bridges (<i>The Walking Dead</i>'s Norman Reedus) and you need to transport some boxes full of all sorts of things between locations in a <i>beautiful</i> post-apocalyptic world. You begin as a regular delivery man and then you become an expert delivery man by the end, essentially.</p>
      <p>But a word of caution, this is a Hideo Kojima game so you know even that won't help you prepare you for what you're about to experience.</p>
      <p>Ghosts, terrorists and rough terrain will try to stop you from delivering your goods and your ultimate goal of connecting a network between the remaining civilisations of the United States again. It's bold, it's innovative and, as some reviewers have said, it can be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20941606/death-stranding-review-ps4-hideo-kojima">plain boring</a>.</p>
