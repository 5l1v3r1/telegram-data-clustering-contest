      <h1>Boris was north of the border but under the radar</h1>
      <h2>Boris Johnson’s latest day trip was to a rural distillery miles from Elgin. As with the other outings, the public were excluded.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T04:30:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Record View, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/record-view/</a></address>
      <p>It was often said Tony Blair never felt comfortable in Scotland and this is undoubtedly true for charlatan <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/boris-johnson-says-scots-tory-20833931">Boris Johnson</a>.</p>
      <p>Although <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/tory-toff-jacob-rees-mogg-20815835">Tory</a> strategists insist the Prime Minister is popular north of the border, Johnson is curiously reluctant to put it to the test.</p>
      <p>His rare visits to Scotland have included fleeting trips to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/faslane-hosts-international-military-drill-20534967">Faslane</a>, a farm in Aberdeenshire and a call on Nicola Sturgeon at Bute House, where he left by the back door.</p>
      <p>Johnson’s latest day trip was to a rural distillery miles from Elgin. As with the other outings, the public were excluded.</p>
      <p>Remarkably for a man who says he cares about every part of the UK, Johnson as PM has never gone walkabout in Scotland to meet the voters he believes like him.</p>

      <p>Johnson and his minders probably fear the “Iain Gray treatment”, a reference to when the former Scottish Labour leader was chased into a branch of Greggs during the Holyrood election in 2011.</p>
      <p>The Tory leader is wise to keep his excursions to Scotland under the radar.</p>
      <p>Slippery and untrustworthy, he also has a habit of making insulting comments about Scotland and the country’s public spending. His right-wing politics are also a major turn-off.</p>
      <p>Johnson is expected to come to Scotland three times during the General Election campaign. He should walk the streets of Glasgow and accept the verdict of the city’s voters.</p>

      <h3>Road to justice</h3>
      <p>Scotland’s justice secretary Humza Yousaf has listened to the families of those who have needlessly died in our prisons – now the learning must begin.</p>
      <p>The review he ordered yesterday must deliver in the name of those who should never have lost their lives in custody.</p>
      <p>Allan Marshall died following brutal restraint, Katie Allan and William Lindsay, took their own lives in a system which betrayed them.</p>
      <p>Nothing will bring them back but if this review prevents another death in our prison system, at least some good will come from tragedy.</p>
      <p>Their deaths are a story of cover-ups, destruction of evidence, collusion, lies and neglect. This move from Humza Yousaf is laudable but it is a first step on the road to justice for victims of a broken system.</p>
      <p>The justice secretary is trying. It is time the Lord Advocate did the same.</p>

      <h3>Barras style</h3>
      <p>You can splash out a fortune on high fashion in Glasgow's style mile. But Slade’s Dave Hill has revealed his distinctive dress was honed in the same city for far less outlay.</p>
      <p>The 70s glam rocker knows the Barras is the place for a bargain.</p>
