      <h2>Nicola Sturgeon wants to block any UK Government plan to use the NHS in a trade deal - but is under fire for her handling of the health service.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T04:30:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Philip, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/andy-philip/</a></address>
      <p>The SNP will table an “NHS protection” law to keep Donald Trump’s hands off the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/nhs-scotland">NHS</a>.</p>
      <p>It follows claims Boris Johnson is eyeing up the health service as a bargaining chip in a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/brexit-1">Brexit</a> trade deal with the US president - a suggestion angrily denied by Tories.</p>
      <p>Fears have also been raised over US pharmaceutical companies gaining special access with more expensive <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/top-doctors-warn-no-deal-13090524">drugs</a>.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Nicola Sturgeon will unveil the plan at her formal election campaign launch in Edinburgh on Friday.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the launch, Sturgeon said: “Boris Johnson has been very clear about his desire for a post-Brexit trade deal with Donald Trump - and no one should underestimate the threat which that poses.</p>
      <p>“So in order to deal with that immediate threat from the Tories’ post-Brexit plans the SNP will bring forward a bill that would protect the NHS across the whole of the UK from ever being harmed by a Tory-Trump trade deal.</p>
      <p>“Our NHS is there to care for and protect us - now it’s our turn to stand up and protect the NHS.”</p>
      <p>The proposed legislation will be outlined in the SNP’s election manifesto. It aims to prevent any future UK Government signing up to an agreement which might the NHS a bargaining chip in any part of Britain.</p>
      <p>It would also offer a “double-lock” by insisting on approval from devolved parliaments and assemblies before deals are done.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister has rejected the claims saying the NHS “is not for sale”.</p>
      <p>And last week Trump said: “It’s not for us to have anything to do with your health service. We’re just talking about trade.”</p>
      <p>But the lack of trust in the PM or president has been a green light for politicians including Sturgeon and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn over the future of the NHS.</p>
      <p>Scots Tory health spokesman Miles Briggs said: “Nicola Sturgeon’s attempts to scaremonger over the NHS are a disgrace. She tried it during the independence referendum – nobody believed her then, and nobody will credit her now.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Sturgeon is under pressure for her handling of the NHS in Scotland, including safety concerns, an unopened children’s hospital, bed-blocking and overstretched A&amp;E departments.</p>

      <p>At First Minister's Questions in Holyrood, Sturgeon admitted it’s still “not clinically safe” to fully open a children’s ward weeks after it was supposed to be running around the clock.</p>
      <p>A commitment was given earlier this year that the ward at St John’s Hospital in West Lothian would be reopened by October.</p>
      <p>It is still shut three nights a week, leading to anger over children in a heavily populated region having to travel to other hospitals for treatment.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a flagship new children’s hospital in Edinburgh is unable to open until next October because of safety concerns.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Scottish Labour leader Richard highlighted a letter sent by a 12-year-old girl who now has to miss a day of school to travel to Edinburgh.</p>
      <p>Erin, from Whitburn, had been getting eye appointments at St John’s regularly since she was nine months old.</p>
      <p>In a letter, read by Leonard, she explained: “The sudden change of location which requires extra travel is unfair as the people that attend these appointments are visually impaired who are being inconvenienced by the lack of NHS staff in St Johns.”</p>
      <p>Sturgeon defended her record and insisted the government is supporting the NHS through recruitment problems.</p>
      <p>“The ward will be open 24/7 as soon as it is clinically safe for it to be so for children and when the recruitment levels, which have been difficult, reach a level at which it can be open," she said.</p>
