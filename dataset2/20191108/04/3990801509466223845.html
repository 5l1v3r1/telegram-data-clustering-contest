      <h1>Adobe will soon allow you to live-stream your painting skills directly from its apps</h1>

      <p>Game streaming platforms such as Twitch are quite popular now. So, if gamers get to show off their skills live, why can’t artists stream what they are drawing.</p>
      <p>Adobe is now building a live-streaming feature in its Creative Cloud apps. The company made this announcement at its MAX event earlier this week. It has already shipped the feature as a beta version in Adobe Fresco, an iPad app for painting, to select users.</p>
      <p>The company’s Chief Product Officer, Scott Belsky, told The Verge while the feature is similar to live-streaming on Twitch, people who’ll be watching this live stream will be interested in tools being used by the artist:</p>
      <blockquote>When you see a live-stream of someone in our products, you want to know what tool they’re using — when they use the tool and when they stop using it — almost like a form of the waveform of video. </blockquote>
      <p>Adobe currently has a program called Adobe Live, which lets featured artists host a live stream on <a href="https://www.behance.net/live">Behance</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/AdobeCreativeCloud">YouTube</a>. However, the new live-streaming feature will open it up for all artists.</p>
      <p>There’s no detail as to when this feature will be rolled out to everyone, and when it will be shipped to other apps in Creative Cloud.</p>
      <p>We’ve asked Adobe for more details, and we’ll update the story if we hear back.</p>
