      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 8): The FBM KLCI shed 0.10% at midday break today, in line with tepid sentiment at regional markets, but held on to its position above the crucial 1,600-point level.</p>
      <p>At 12.30pm, the FBM KLCI was down 1.68 points to 1,607.65.</p>
      <p>Losers overtook gainers by 290 to 223, while 593 counters traded unchanged. Volume was 1.71 billion shares, valued at RM928.94 million.</p>

      <p><i>Reuters</i> said most Southeast Asian markets on Friday, retreated from the recent risk-on rally, with Singapore falling the most as sentiment was hit by doubts over Washington's tariff rollback announcement.</p>
      <p>A <i>Reuters</i> exclusive report of fierce internal opposition in the White House to a possible rollback of U.S. tariffs on China, diminished initial optimism over a "phase-one" deal being reached between the two.</p>
      <p>Kenanga IB Research said Asian stocks were up on Thursday, as China agreed with US to cancel existing trade tariffs in phases.</p>
      <p>Back home, it said FBM KLCI too reacted positively and gained 6.08 points (+0.38%) to close at 1,609.33.</p>
      <p>“Chart-wise, we see encouraging momentum, as yesterday's candlestick continued to close higher above its 20- and 50-Day SMA. Coupled with an uptick in RSI, we expect the upward momentum to continue.</p>
      <p>“From here on, overhead resistance can be seen at 1,630 (R1) and 1,650 (R2). Conversely, key support levels can be found at 1,570 (R1) and 1,550 (R2),” it said.</p>
