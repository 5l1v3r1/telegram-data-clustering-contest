      <p>Trump's appearance on "The View" began with co-host Joy Behar rattling off a ist of President Trump's mishaps and controversial moments when Trump Jr. reminded the panel that "we've all done things that we regret."</p>
      <p>“We've all done things that we regret. Joy, you have worn blackface," Trump Jr. said at one point during the contentious segment.</p>
      <p>Trump also sparred with co-hosts Whoopi Goldberg, Meghan McCain, Abby Huntsman and Sunny Hostin.</p>

      <p>Trump defended himself from criticism after Tweeting the Ukraine whistleblower's name, blasting critics.</p>
      <p>"I wish they would have shown a little bit of the same amount of outrage when my family opened up a white powder substance in an exploding envelope that showed up at my house," Trump said. "These guys are full of it, Sean."</p>
      <p>Trump, who was promoting his new book in Birmingham, Alabama and had a live crowd behind him during his appearance on "Hannity", also blasted Hunter Biden and his father former Vice President Joe Biden.</p>

      <p>"Hunter Biden is getting boards of companies and languages he can't speak, in companies he knows nothing about," Trump said. "Why are you there Hunter?"</p>
      <p>"Well, I know why you're there. I think everyone in America knows why you're there," Trump said, prompting at the crowd to applaud.</p>
