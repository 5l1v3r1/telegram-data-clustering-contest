      <p><b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fire_emblem_three_houses">Fire Emblem: Three Houses</a></b> third wave of content is now available, and alongside this is the release of Version 1.1.0. Unlike the new DLC, this patch is entirely free and will give you access to more save files and makes a few other quality of life changes. It also fixes some bugs and resolves a number of issues.</p>
      <p>If you have access to the Expansion Pass content, you can get a better idea of what to expect from the third wave of content, as these patch notes outline exactly what has been added. See for yourself below:</p>
