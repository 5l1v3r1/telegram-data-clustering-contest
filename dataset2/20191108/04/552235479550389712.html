      <h2>A court heard how four-year-old Leylan Forte died in Montrose after becoming seriously ill.</h2>

      <p>A young boy who died from dehydration, gastroenteritis and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/norovirus-outbreak-glasgow-primary-school-20825595">norovirus</a> may have faced a delay of five hours before he was seen by a doctor, a court was told yesterday.</p>
      <p>A fatal accident inquiry into Leylan Forte’s death in Montrose on April 27, 2015, will be held next year.</p>
      <p>The four-year-old suffered from suspected autism, cerebral palsy, an eating disorder and wasn’t able to communicate.</p>
      <p>A preliminary hearing at Forfar Sheriff <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/ayrshire/man-jailed-after-shouting-abuse-20833816">Court</a> heard the probe would look into whether out-of-hours helpline NHS 24 and Leylan’s GP practice, Annat Bank Surgery in Montrose, “responded adequately” to calls.</p>
      <p>The court heard NHS 24 was contacted at 6am and the surgery at 8.20am.</p>

      <p>Carol Whyte, procurator fiscal depute to the inquiry, said the Crown’s information suggested that a GP then went to assess Leylan at 11am.</p>
      <p>She added a pathologist would comment on whether the delay is likely to have contributed to Leylan’s death.</p>
      <p>Helen Watts, counsel for NHS 24, said: “It would be my suspicion that a pathologist would not be the best person to comment.”</p>
      <p>The preliminary hearing was continued until December 13.</p>

      <p>The fatal accident inquiry has been ordered because of “serious public concern about his death”.</p>
      <p>Last year Leylan’s devastated parents threatened to sue NHS 24 over his death, after receiving a report from a professor of medicine in which, according to them, the expert expressed a belief that the official health helpline had given them wrong advice.</p>
      <p>Leylan’s mother, Leanne Smith, who has herself since died, told a reporter at the time: “With better advice Leylan might still be alive.”</p>
