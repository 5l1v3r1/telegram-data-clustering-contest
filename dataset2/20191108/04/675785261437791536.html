      <h2>United need additions in new year as they target a rise up the Premier League places and Europa League glory</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T04:55:37+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 04:55</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United are the bookmakers' favourites to sign Erling Braut Haaland and James Maddison in the January transfer window.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">United</a> sealed a place in the last 32 of the Europa League with a 3-0 win over Partizan Belgrade at Old Trafford on Thursday, but are still struggling in 10th place in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils have been widely expected to strengthen in January, with a striker a priority - although boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ole-gunnar-solskjaer-issues-update-20826610">has admitted it will be difficult to get the players they want in January</a>.</p>
      <p>However, two players who look set to switch to United - according to the bookies, at least - are Red Bull Salzburg striker Haaland and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> City attacking midfielder <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/james-maddison">Maddison</a> .</p>
      <p>Maddison has been long been linked with United, while Haaland has impressed with his goalscoring exploits in the Champions League and the Austrian Bundesliga.</p>

      <p>Sky Bet makes United favourites to sign both players when the transfer window reopens in the new year, offering odds of 2/1 on Haaland to join United and 9/2 for Maddison to make the switch to Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>Haaland, 19, is the Champions League's top scorer so far this season with seven goals in Salzburg's opening four games, and is the subject of interest from Liverpool, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> as well as United.</p>
      <p>He scored a penalty in Salzburg's 1-1 draw away to Napoli on Tuesday - while his brace against the same opponents in the previous match wrote his name into the record books.</p>
      <p>That double meant the Norwegian became the first player to score six goals in his first three Champions League appearances.</p>

      <p>He also became the second teenager to score in each of his first three Champions League appearances, after Karim Benzema, and the first teenager to score six goals in a Champions League season.</p>
      <p>Haaland scored a hat-trick in Salzburg's 6-2 win over Genk in their opening Champions League game, followed by one in their 4-3 defeat to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> .</p>
      <p>According to stats website <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/erling-haaland/marktwertverlauf/spieler/418560">Transfermarkt</a> , Haaland's market value has shot up to £27m since from around £5million at the start of the season. He is contracted to Salzburg until 2023.</p>
      <p>Maddison is also contracted until 2023 and is valued at around £40m - although with Leicester currently third in the Premier League and gunning for a Champions League place they are likely to play hardball in order to avoid selling to a rival.</p>
