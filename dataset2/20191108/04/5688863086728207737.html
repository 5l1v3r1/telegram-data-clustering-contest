        <b>Kings XI Punjab have traded Ravichandran Ashwin to the Delhi Capitals from the next season of the IPL. The deal included 1.5 Crore rupees and left-arm spinner Jagadeesha Suchith in return to Punjab and a failed negotitation for New Zealand speedster Trent Boult in addition to this.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The speculations of <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/ravichandran_ashwin">Ravichandran Ashwin</a> leaving <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/team/kings_xi_punjab">Kings Xi Punjab</a> have finally come to an end with him joining the Delhi Capitals and Kings XI Punjab getting 1.5 crore rupees and Jagadeesha Suchith in return. The Punjab-based franchise also wanted <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/trent_boult">Trent Boult</a> as a part of the Trade but that move failed to materialize.  </p>
      <p>"Everyone is happy with this deal. We are happy, Ashwin is happy and Delhi is happy. We were in talks with three teams but have finally come to this conclusion. We wish Ashwin the very best," KXIP co-owner Ness Wadia told PTI.</p>
      <p>Ashwin had impressed everyone with his captaincy in the first half of the last season of the IPL but failed to gather any momentum in the second half, thereby finishing out of the playoffs spot for a second year running after having made a promising start. This led to arguments between the franchise owners and the captain and speculation of the captaincy being handed to <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/kl_rahul">KL Rahul</a> added spice to the saga. Kings XI Punjab were in talks with three other IPL teams too but finally made the call to trade Ashwin to the Delhi-based franchise.</p>
      <p>Ashwin will be paid Rs. 7.6 crores, his auction value, and the official announcement by the club will be made before the transfer window closes on the 14th of November. </p>
      <p>In Kings XI Punjab's history, they have only reached the playoffs twice and once in the final where they lost to an inspired Kolkata Knight Riders side. The team management has gone through massive changes with veteran <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/anil_kumble">Anil Kumble</a> now at the helm along with the services of <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/george_bailey">George Bailey</a> as Batting coach and Jonty Rhodes as the fielding coach. The Punjab-based franchise will now look to rebuild their squad come the IPL auctions and will look to finally win their first ever IPL title in the upcoming season. On the other hand, the Delhi Capitals with three quality spinners like Ashwin, <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/amit_mishra">Amit Mishra</a> and <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/axar_patel">Axar Patel</a> who have the experience of playing for India, have a great chance too for breaking their jinx and winning their maiden IPL title.</p>
