      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 8): Heineken Malaysia Bhd recently launched Drinkies, its Draught@Home service, bringing the bar to Malaysian homes.</p>
      <p>In a statement today, the brewer said this new offering will bring greater convenience to consumers.</p>
      <p>Heineken Malaysia managing director Roland Bala said consumers seek convenience and better experience anytime, anywhere.</p>
      <p>“They want their products right here, right now. With a consumer-inspired approach, Drinkies solves the biggest pain point of home consumption — carrying heavy beverages home.</p>
      <p>“Order via Drinkies.my and you can have your favourite chilled beers, ciders and more, delivered directly to your doorstep within 60 minutes or scheduled at your convenience,” he said.</p>
      <p>Bala said Drinkies by Heineken Malaysia is a one-stop-shop that curates drinks, snacks and services for all party occasions.</p>
      <p>“Beyond enhancing end-to-end consumer experience from purchasing to delivery of alcoholic beverages, the online platform is the first in the country to deliver chilled beers and ciders on demand to consumers’ doorstep within 60 minutes.</p>
      <p>“The on-demand delivery service is currently available in select locations within Klang Valley, Penang and Johor Bahru,” he said.</p>
      <p>Heineken said as for the Draught@Home service that is available nationwide, consumers can place their orders in advance before their planned event via <a href="http://www.drinkies.my/">www.drinkies.my</a> or contact the Drinkies Hotline at 012-281-8888 for any enquiries.</p>
      <p>At 12.11pm, Heineken added 0.16% or 4 sen to RM24.28, valuing it at RM7.64 billion.</p>
