      <p>BARTLESVILLE, Oklahoma (WABC) -- An investigation is underway after a frightening medical mistake in Oklahoma.</p>
      <p>Authorities say 10 people who thought they were being injected with the flu vaccine were actually given insulin.</p>
      <p>The error happened Wednesday at Jacquelyn House, a facility for disabled residents.</p>
      <p>When police arrived, they say it was a chaotic scene as patients were reacting to the insulin.</p>
      <p>"All these people are symptomatic, laying on the ground, needing help but can't communicate what they need," said Chief Tracy Roles with the Bartlesville Police Department.</p>
      <p>Fortunately all of the patients are OK.</p>
      <p>Investigators say a pharmacist was contracted to give the patients flu shots, but somehow the syringes were filled with insulin.</p>
