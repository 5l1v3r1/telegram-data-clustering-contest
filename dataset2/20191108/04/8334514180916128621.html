      <p>Rust stole the puck from Brock Nelson behind the net and tucked a wraparound shot past Islanders goalie Semyon Varlamov to cap the comeback by the Penguins, who snapped a two-game losing streak.</p>
      <p>Jared McCann, Rust and Evgeni Malkin scored in the first nine minutes of the third period for the Penguins. Goalie Matt Murray overcame a slow start to make 20 saves.</p>
      <p>Casey Cizikas, Cal Clutterbuck and Adam Pelech scored for the Islanders, whose winning streak was the second-longest in franchise history behind a 15-game run during the 1981-82 season. Varlamov made 35 saves.</p>
      <p>Avalanche 9, Predators 4</p>
      <p>Joonas Donskoi had three goals for his first career hat trick, Nathan MacKinnon had a goal and three assists, and host Colorado used a six-goal second period to beat Nashville in Denver.</p>
      <p>The six goals came in a span of eight minutes as Colorado went from down 3-2 five minutes into the second period to up 8-3 with 6:34 left in the frame. The win snapped a five-game losing streak for the Avalanche.</p>
      <p>Ryan Graves, Cale Makar and Andre Burakovsky had a goal and two assists each, Matt Nieto and Matt Calvert also had goals, and Erik Johnson added two assists to help Colorado end an eight-game home losing streak to Nashville.</p>
      <p>Maple Leafs 2, Golden Knights 1</p>
      <p>John Tavares scored at 2:33 of overtime to complete host Toronto’s comeback against visiting Vegas.</p>
      <p>Tavares, who also had an assist in the game, took a pass from Mitch Marner and fired a shot from the right circle for his fourth goal of the season. Auston Matthews also scored for the Maple Leafs, tying the game in the third period with his 13th.</p>
      <p>Max Pacioretty broke a scoreless tie 4:08 into the third for the Golden Knights, his fourth tally of the season. The teams combined for one goal on 11 power plays, Matthews’ tying score at 8:14 of the third.</p>
      <p>Capitals 5, Panthers 4 (OT)</p>
      <p>Tom Wilson scored two goals, including the game winner 17 seconds into overtime, as Washington defeated host Florida in Sunrise, Fla.</p>
      <p>The Capitals have won five straight games and have earned at least one point in 10 straight contests.</p>
      <p>Washington also got two goals and one assist from Alex Ovechkin and one goal and two assists from John Carlson.</p>
      <p>Ovechkin, who has won the NHL goal-scoring title a league-record eight times, leads Washington with 13 goals.</p>
      <p>Flyers 3, Canadiens 2 (OT)</p>
      <p>Sean Couturier scored 55 seconds into overtime to lift host Philadelphia past Montreal.</p>
      <p>Couturier’s shot went under the arm of Canadiens goaltender Carey Price for the Flyers’ second straight win.</p>
      <p>Philippe Myers and James van Riemsdyk each added one goal for Philadelphia, which went 0-for-6 on the power play but nonetheless found a way to win. Flyers goaltender Carter Hart made 22 saves.</p>
      <p>Rangers 4, Hurricanes 2</p>
      <p>New York goalie Henrik Lundqvist made enough early stops and his teammates finally generated offense in a 4-2 victory against host Carolina in Raleigh, N.C..</p>
      <p>Lundqvist made 22 of his season-high 45 saves in the first period.</p>
      <p>Artemi Panarin, Brendan Lemieux, Pavel Buchnevich and Adam Fox scored for New York, which took advantage of limited scoring opportunities.</p>
      <p>The Rangers have won two in a row and four of their last five games.</p>
      <p>Senators 3, Kings 2 (OT)</p>
      <p>Jean-Gabriel Pageau scored with 1:48 left in overtime to lift Ottawa over visiting Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>Anthony Duclair and Artem Anisimov also scored, and Anders Nilsson made 26 saves for the Senators, who improved to 2-5-1 when allowing the first goal.</p>
      <p>Dustin Brown and Tyler Toffoli scored — the latter to tie it with eight seconds left in regulation — and Jack Campbell made 30 saves for the Kings, who are 1-5-1 in their past seven games.</p>
      <p>Blue Jackets 3, Coyotes 2</p>
      <p>Oliver Bjorkstrand took advantage of a defensive mistake to score the tiebreaking goal midway through the third period, and Columbus held on for a win in Glendale, Ariz.</p>
      <p>The Blue Jackets ended a five-game losing streak, with Gustav Nyquist adding a goal and two assists and Emil Remstrom contributing a goal. Joonas Korpisalo stopped 30 shots.</p>
      <p>Carl Soderberg and Jakob Chychrun scored goals for the Coyotes, who trailed 1-0 just 14 seconds into the game on Nyquist’s goal.</p>
      <p>Flames 5, Devils 2</p>
      <p>Noah Hanifin collected one goal and two assists during host Calgary’s four-goal second period, and the Flames cruised past New Jersey.</p>
      <p>Mikael Backlund, Sean Monahan and Johnny Gaudreau each netted one goal and one assist while goalie David Rittich made 21 saves for the Flames, who have won four of their past five games.</p>
      <p>The Devils actually opened the scoring when 2019 first overall draft pick Jack Hughes lit the lamp with 4:16 left in the opening frame for his fourth goal. But Backlund’s power-play goal at 14:53 of the second period broke a 2-2 tie and it was all Flames from there.</p>
      <p>Blackhawks 5, Canucks 2</p>
      <p>Patrick Kane recorded a goal and two assists, Dylan Strome had three assists, and Corey Crawford made 36 saves to lead Chicago past visiting Vancouver.</p>
      <p>Alex DeBrincat, Andrew Shaw, David Kampf and Brandon Saad notched goals for the Blackhawks, who improved to 4-3-2 on home ice. Olli Maatta had two assists.</p>
      <p>J.T. Miller and Jake Virtanen scored for the Canucks, whose eight-game point streak (5-0-3) ended. Jacob Markstrom stopped 32 of 35 shots.</p>
      <p>Sharks 6, Wild 5</p>
      <p>Logan Couture had a goal and three assists as host San Jose Sharks grabbed a four-goal lead then held on to defeat Minnesota in a wild affair.</p>
