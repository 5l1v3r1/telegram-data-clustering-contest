      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Zlatan-Ibrahimovic">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a> is set to rejoin Italian side <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/AC-Milan">AC Milan</a> after his successful stint at <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/LA-Galaxy">LA Galaxy</a>, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Major-League-Soccer">Major League Soccer</a> Commissioner <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Don-Garber">Don Garber</a> has said.</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old Swedish striker has spent the past 18 months in <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/MLS">MLS</a> but his contract with Galaxy expires at the end of the year and he has been linked with a host of European clubs.</p>
      <p>Ibrahimovic played for Milan between 2010 and 2012, scoring 42 goals in 61 league appearances, and Garber said he was on his way back to Serie A.</p>
      <p>"Zlatan is such an interesting guy," he told ESPN. "He keeps my hands full and my inbox full, but he's a thrill-a-minute.</p>
      <p>"He is a 38-year-old guy who is being recruited by AC Milan, one of the top clubs in the world."</p>
      <p>Ibrahamovic was named in the MLS Best XI in 2018 and 2019 after netting 53 goals in the competition.</p>
      <p>His season with Galaxy ended after they suffered a 5-3 defeat by local rivals Los Angeles Football Club in the MLS Cup Western Conference semi-finals last month.</p>
