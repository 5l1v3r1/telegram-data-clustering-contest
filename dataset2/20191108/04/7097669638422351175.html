      <p>A Hong Kong student who fell from a car park while police and protesters were clashing last weekend has died, hospital officials said Friday, in a development likely to further escalate tensions after months of violent rallies in the city.</p>
      <p>Alex Chow, a 22-year-old computer science undergraduate, was certified dead at 8.09am on Friday, Queen Elizabeth Hospital said.</p>
      <p>Chow was taken to hospital in an unconscious state in the early hours of Monday morning following late-night clashes between police and protesters.</p>
      <p>He was found lying unconscious in a pool of blood inside a car park that police had fired tear gas into after protesters hurled objects from the building.</p>
      <p>The precise chain of events leading to Chow's fall are unclear and disputed, but he has been embraced by the five-month-old protest movement and his death could trigger renewed clashes as the city braces for another weekend of rallies.</p>
      <p>Chow was a student at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. The college was holding its graduation ceremony Friday morning, and university head Wei Shyy paused the proceedings to announce Chowâ€™s death and observe a moment of silence.</p>
      <p>Fellow students had been holding a vigil round the clock for Chow as doctors battled to save his life. Sources told AFP doctors had performed two surgeries in a bid to reduce swelling in his brain.</p>
      <p>Protesters have alleged that Chow fell because he was forced to climb onto the ledge of the multi-storey car park to escape multiple tear gas rounds fired into the building by police.</p>
      <p>Police officials acknowledge that tear gas had been used to disperse protesters near the car park, but say there was only a small amount of gas in the air when emergency responders found Chow.</p>
      <p>They have also denied interfering with rescuers treating the student, or blocking the ambulance that took him to hospital.</p>
      <p>Since June, Hong Kong has been shaken by large-scale and increasingly violent protests calling for greater democratic freedoms and police accountability.</p>
      <p>China has run the city under a special "one country, two systems" model, allowing Hong Kong liberties not seen on the mainland, since its handover from the British in 1997.</p>
      <p>But public anger has been building for years over fears that Beijing is eroding those freedoms, especially since President Xi Jinping came to power.</p>
      <p>Protesters have issued a list of demands, including fully free elections to choose the city's leader and an investigation into alleged abuses by police.</p>
