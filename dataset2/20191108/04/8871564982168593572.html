      <p>Two suspects have been arrested by authorities for their alleged involvement in the killing of radio announcer Dindo Generoso, who was ambushed in Dumaguete City yesterday morning.</p>
      <p>Teddy Reyes Salaw and Glenn Corsame — a retired policeman — were nabbed last night in Dumaguete. Police told CNN Philippines that they were caught in possession of a loaded .45 caliber pistol.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The authorities alleged that Corsame <a href="https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1187347/police-identify-gunman-in-dumaguete-city-radiomans-slay">drove the motorcycle</a> from which the alleged gunman — identified as active-duty Police Corp. Roger Rubio — fired into Generoso’s vehicle, <i>The Philippine Daily Inquirer </i>reports. Salaw, meanwhile, allegedly acted as a lookout and drove a pickup truck where he and Rubio, <a href="https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/regions/714678/2-suspects-in-dumaguete-radio-broadcaster-slay-arrested/story/">who remains at large</a>, allegedly waiting for Generoso before Rubio switched to the motorbike.</p>
      <p>Corsame and Salaw are currently detained at the city’s police station, and authorities have launched a manhunt for Rubio.</p>
      <p>The police are looking at the possibility that Generoso was killed in connection with his work. They also said that it was also possible that he was killed in relation to a land dispute, or because of politics due to his decision to <a href="https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/regions/714668/politics-land-dispute-possible-motives-behind-dumaguete-radioman-s-slay-police/story/?just_in&amp;headline">run for Dumaguete mayor</a> in the 2016 elections, <i>GMA News </i>reported.</p>
      <p>Generoso, 67, was driving to work at radio station DYEM when he <a href="https://news.mb.com.ph/2019/11/07/radio-broadcaster-shot-dead-in-dumaguete-city/">was ambushed</a> along the city’s Hibbard Avenue. He is the second Dumaguete City-based radio journalist to have been ambushed by unknown gunmen within the past year. The last one was Edmond Sotoso, who was <a href="https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/268758/radio-blocktimer-shot-dead-by-riding-in-tandem-gunmen">killed in April 2018.</a></p>
      <p>Generoso’s death also comes just weeks after <a href="https://coconuts.co/manila/news/suspect-in-tabloid-columnists-killing-identified-by-government/">the killing of tabloid columnist</a> Jupiter Gonzales in Arayat town in Pampanga.</p>
      <p>The International Federation of Journalists has said the Philippines is <a href="https://www.ifj.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Underneath_the_Autocrats_-_IFJ_SEAJU_2018_-_SP_HR.pdf">one of the most dangerous places</a> in the world to practice journalism. A 2018 report released by the group identified at least 85 cases of acts against journalists between June 2016 and May 2018, including murders, attempted murders, death threats, online harassment, and police surveillance.</p>
