      <p>LONDON (AFP) — Royal Mail on Friday made a High Court bid to block a postal strike by workers due next month ahead of Christmas and around the time of Britain’s general election.</p>
      <p>Members of the Communication Workers Union recently voted to strike amid a dispute with management over pay and other employment conditions.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Royal Mail pointed to “potential irregularities in the ballot.”</p>
      <p>It added: “The company is making this High Court application because the integrity and legal soundness of any electoral process is vital,” Royal Mail said in relation to the strike ballot.</p>
      <p>“This is particularly the case in relation to potential industrial action around the general election on 12 December 2019. </p>
      <p>“Royal Mail is also making this application because of the damage industrial action would do to the company and its customers in the run-up to Christmas,” the group added.</p>
      <p>It expects the hearing to take place next week.</p>
