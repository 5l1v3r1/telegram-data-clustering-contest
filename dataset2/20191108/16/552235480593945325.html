      <p>A burly yob who glassed a man’s face in a savage pub attack has been jailed for 19 months.</p>
      <p>Stephen Torrance, 39, charged at victim Brogan Moore, and plunged a glass tumbler into his forehead, leaving him bleeding heavily from a wound above his eye.</p>
      <p>He also grabbed him around the shoulders and shoved him over a table, sparking mayhem in the pub.</p>
      <p>Paisley Sheriff Court heard Torrance had been drinking at the Thorn Inn, in Johnstone, when he took umbrage at Mr Moore, who was with a group of friends.</p>
      <p>Procurator Fiscal Depute Keri Marshall told the court the victim had been spending the evening with pals on February 2 this year when he encountered Torrance at the bar and he started abusing him.</p>
      <p>She said: “The complainer had gone to The Thorn Inn, Johnstone, and was drinking with friends. The evening was relatively uneventful.</p>
      <p>The group had some drinks. At 9.30pm witness Moore made his way to the bar area to buy some drinks. At that point he come into contact with a male unknown to him. The male is the accused.</p>
      <p>“While at the bar various comments were made by the accused to Mr Moore, which he felt were abusive, so he challenged back with comments.</p>
      <p>“A minor altercation took place. The witness Moore walked away from the accused to return back to where his friends were.”</p>
      <p>The court heard at that point Torrance flipped out and went after Mr Moore.</p>
      <p>The prosecutor added: “While the complainer was walking away the accused pursued him and grabbed him by the throat.</p>
      <p>“Mr Moore became free and showed his hands to deter the accused from further assault, and walked towards his friends.</p>
      <p>“The accused then charged at him holding a pint glass in his right hand.</p>
      <p>“The accused struck witness Moore on the face with the pint glass and pushed him over a table seated behind him.”</p>
      <p>The court was shown CCTV footage of the entire attack where several drinkers jumped in immediately afterward and grabbed Torrance and pulled him away from the victim.</p>
      <p>Ms Marshall told how the victim was left bleeding heavily from the wound above his left eye.</p>
      <p>He was taken to the Royal Alexandria Hospital in Paisley for treatment and he received 12 stitches for his injuries.</p>
      <p>The doctor who treated him confirmed the injury will result in a permanent facial scarring.</p>
      <p>Yesterday electrical supervisor and father-of-two Torrance, from Glasgow Road in Paisley, appeared at a pre-trial hearing where he pleaded guilty to a charge assault to severe injury and permanent disfigurement against Mr Moore, where he seized hold of him by the throat, pursued him, and struck him on the head with a glass causing it to smash, and pushed him over a table.</p>
      <p>Defence agent Campbell Porter said Torrance had been “horrified” at what he had done and realised he would being going to jail because he has previous convictions for violence.</p>
      <p>He added: “There is not a lot can be said in mitigation for the incident. He consumed too much alcohol, became involved in an altercation, and his reaction is what your lordship has seen.</p>
      <p>“He must face the consequences for that behaviour.”</p>
      <p>Sheriff McCartney agreed and locked up Torrance for 19 months, reduced from two years, because of his early plea of guilty.</p>
