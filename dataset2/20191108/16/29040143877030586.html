      <h3>What you need to know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>OnePlus devices running both Android 9 and 10 are being affected by the high battery drain.</li>
        <li>WhatsApp version 2.19.308 appears to be the culprit for the cause of the drain.</li>
        <li>Some Xiaomi phone users are reporting that they are being affected by the bug as well.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>OnePlus phones have been great on battery life for the last few iterations of smartphones, however, users of WhatsApp on these devices are having their batteries hammered.</p>
      <p>OnePlus users are reporting on <a href="http://tyvm.ly/pAqFk">Reddit,</a> <a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/search/424184837/?q=whatsapp+battery&amp;o=date&amp;c%5Btitle_only%5D=1">OnePlus forums,</a> and even through the <a href="https://andauth.co/7x8PLd">Play Store</a> that WhatsApp is drastically draining their batteries by 40% or more. To make matters worse, they are getting this horrendous effect even with limited use of the app.</p>
      <p>Now, this issue isn't being seen across all OnePlus devices, only on phones using Android 9 and 10 — which is a large swath of OnePlus smartphones. It doesn't appear to be every one that uses WhatsApp on their OnePlus phones, but it does seem to be a reasonably high number of folks — even some Xiaomi users are reporting this issue as well.</p>
      <p>Hopefully, this bug gets squashed soon, because phones from OnePlus like their <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-7t-review">fantastic 7T</a> is one of the best phones Android fans can get right now.</p>
