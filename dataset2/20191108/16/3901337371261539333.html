      <h1>Pirates To Have New Leader For Chiefs Clash?    </h1>

      <p>Orlando Pirates will have a different leader on the field against Kaizer Chiefs in this weekend’s Soweto Derby, with indications that a fellow defender and the usual partner of Happy Jele in central defence could get the nod for the role. </p>
      <p>Pirates will be without Jele, who has been a key defender and captain of the side, against Amakhosi on Saturday. </p>

      </p>
      <p>For the first time this season, against Stellenbosch FC in Cape Town, the Buccaneers started the game with a new captain in Ntsikelelo Nyauza. </p>
      <p>However, the Soweto giants lost the match 1-0, before bouncing back to win 1-0 against Highlands Park in the next match. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Indications are that Nyauza could get the nod to lead Bucs for a second time in what should be a big moment on a big occasion such as the Soweto Derby, after struggling for game-time at the start of the season.</p>
      <p>Moreover, Nyauza took over the armband from Jele when he was red-carded against Maritzburg United in Tuesday night’s 0-0 draw.   </p>
      <p>Nyauza, 29, failed to feature for Pirates in the first three matches of the season in the league, but has been a regular in the starting line-up under coach Rulani Mokwena. </p>
