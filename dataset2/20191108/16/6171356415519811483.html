      <h1>The Nokia 7.1 drops to just $210, the lowest price it's ever been</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T16:30:35+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 16:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/hagop-kavafian/" target="_blank">Hagop Kavafian</a></address>
      <p>Even though the Nokia 7.1 came out more than a year ago, it still offers excellent value for money. The device was initially selling for $350 when it was released, but you can now get it for just $210, which is $40 less than what it <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/08/13/all-time-low-nokia-7-1-drops-to-250-100-off/">dropped to during the summer</a>.</p>

      <p>The Nokia 7.1 features a Snapdragon 636 SoC, 4GB of RAM, a 5.84" 1080p display, a 3,060mAh battery, and 64GB of internal storage, which can be expanded thanks to a microSD card slot.</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/11/16/nokia-7-1-review-unrealized-potential/">our review</a>, we praised the phone's build quality and form-factor but were disappointed by its performance. Nevertheless, this is an exciting deal, especially how low the price is. Some owners have also mentioned the phone has become a bit faster thanks to the latest updates.</p>
