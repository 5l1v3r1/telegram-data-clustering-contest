      <h1>Mayor of Pocahontas endorses Joe Biden over Elizabeth Warren</h1>

      <p>The mayor of Pocahontas, Iowa, has endorsed Joe Biden over Elizabeth Warren three months out from the first-in-the-nation caucuses — an overlap in Democratic presidential politics between a small municipality and President Trump's derisive nickname for one of the party's leading candidate.</p>
      <p>Trump frequently mocks Warren as "Pocahontas," a play on the Massachusetts senator's claims to Native American ancestry when applying to law school professor jobs in the 1980s and 1990s. <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/elizabeth-warrens-dna-test-shows-strong-evidence-of-native-american-blood">Last year,</a> she released DNA test results that revealed she had one Native American ancestor six to 10 generations ago.</p>

      <p>Dick Gruber, mayor of the rural, northwest Iowa city of under 2,000 people, announced he was backing the former vice president, 76, over Warren, 70, via the Biden campaign.</p>
      <p>Jake Braun, Biden's Iowa state director, touted the endorsement alongside nine others in an email Friday morning to reporters.</p>
      <p>“Iowans know that Joe Biden is the strongest candidate to beat Donald Trump next November, and that’s why leaders from across the state are coming forward to proudly show their support,” Braun wrote in a statement.</p>
      <p>Braun, who has been blamed by some Democrats for Biden's <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/biden-comes-in-fourth-place-in-iowa-poll-as-buttigieg-rises">struggles</a> in Iowa given he <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-29/biden-in-danger-of-humiliating-loss-in-iowa-top-democrats-warn">doesn't live there full-time</a>, added Biden had a "proven record of turning progressive ideas into real results."</p>
      <p>"And Iowa leaders are excited about," he said, citing "standing up for the middle class" and "combating climate change" as examples.</p>
      <p>While the Biden campaign boasts of having "nearly 80" Iowa elected officials, community leaders, and activists backing his presidential bid, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-29/biden-in-danger-of-humiliating-loss-in-iowa-top-democrats-warn">Iowa Starting Line's reports</a> a more conservative estimate of 27 endorsements, as of Nov. 5. In contrast, the same publication notes Warren has 52 endorsements.</p>
      <p>Although not always the case, Biden and Warren's number of respective endorsements reflects their performance in Iowa-based polls. She averages 21.8% support, surpassing his 15.5%, according to <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/ia/iowa_democratic_presidential_caucus-6731.html">RealClearPolitics data</a>.</p>
