      <h1>After baby found dead inside dumpster, Saskatoon police 'urgently' search for mom</h1>

      <p>SASKATOON -- Time is of the essence in finding the mother of a baby found dead in a dumpster behind apartment buildings in downtown Saskatoon, police say.</p>
      <p>Police spokeswoman Alyson Edwards told reporters Friday the baby was recently born and police are "urgently" looking for the mother, who may be in a vulnerable physical and emotional state.</p>
      <p>"We want this mother to come forward. We want to assist her in any way we can. Thatâ€™s the priority."</p>
      <p>Police say there is evidence of a recent birth, but believe the birth occurred at another location.</p>
      <p>An early step in the search will be to contact health facilities, Edwards said.</p>
      <p>"Perhaps someone knows of a woman who was pregnant recently and is not pregnant any longer but there is no evidence of a child in that person's life. They may have information that is critical to locating this mother."</p>

      <p>Police were initially called to the scene, in the 400 block of 5th Avenue North, around 8:50 a.m., after a report of an unknown problem.</p>
      <p>Forensic investigators could be seen blocking off a recycling dumpster with a large blue tarp. The dumpster was eventually hoisted onto a truck and removed from the scene.</p>

      </p>
      <p>A man who lives in a nearby apartment building said he was among those who discovered the baby Friday morning.</p>
      <p>He said he came across a neighbour and a bottle-picker looking in the dumpster where the infant was found.</p>
      <p>"The guy searching for bottles came across the infant, and I helped the other guy take the infant out, it was a baby girl, probably newborn," Jonathon Mercredi said in an interview.</p>
      <p>"It was something I'll never forget actually."</p>
      <p>Police have not shared the infant's gender publically.</p>
      <p>Mercredi said the baby was wrapped in a reusable shopping bag that was also wrapped in plastic.</p>
      <p>After the police were called, Mercredi and the man who helped him remove the baby returned it to the dumpster because they considered it a crime scene.</p>
      <p>"It's going to be at the back of my mind, I don't know how I'm going to sleep tonight"</p>
      <p>An autopsy is scheduled for Tuesday to learn about the cause of death and when it occurred, Edwards said.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information about the mother is asked to contact the Saskatoon Police Service at 306-975-8300 or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477.</p>
