      <p>The hilarious star of ‘The Daily show’, Trevor Noah, will be bringing his latest tour to Arena Birmingham on Saturday 23 May 2020.</p>
      <p>The 35 year old has become somewhat of a legend in the comedy circuit after recently picking up the 2019 NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series, plus two other nominations.</p>
      <p>But it’s his political viewpoints and progressive attitudes that fuel his new found status. In April 2018 he set up a youth development initiative to help young people prepare for work and education through Microsoft.</p>
