      <h1>Oneplus 8 Pro Rumour Hints at a 120hz Display for Next Year's Handset</h1>

      <p>We've only just seen the One Plus 7T series finish launching, but there's another leak about next year's OnePlus handsets already.</p>
      <p>Onelus only just wrapped up its 7T launch, with the release of the OnePlus 7T Pro McLaren Edition this week, and we're already hearing titbits about next year's OnePlus 8 Pro, with Twitter leaker <a href="https://twitter.com/Samsung_News_/status/1192538585431519235">Max J</a> putting a pretty big hint out there that we can expect the Pro to boast a 120 Hz display.</p>
      <p>The tweet features an image that just straight up says 120Hz, while the accompanying text reads, "Be a 'pro'," and in case that was too subtle, he followed up with confirmation that he was, in fact, <a href="https://twitter.com/Samsung_News_/status/1192538585431519235">referring to a OnePlus handset</a>.</p>

      <p>OnePlus has previously said that going forward, its smartphones will feature a <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/09/oneplus-phones-all-90hz-display/">90Hz display at minimum</a>, so it's likely that the OnePlus 8 will tick that box, while the Pro version will take it up a notch to 120Hz.</p>
      <p>Last month, prior to the OnePlus 7T Pro launch, <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/10/oneplus-8-leaked-renders/">leaked renders for the OnePlus 8</a> were doing the rounds, so slivers of info on both devices are already sneaking out into the world ahead of next year's official announcements.
