        <li>The 1,000-mph <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/a25471425/1000-mph-bloodhound-ssc-project-dead/">Bloodhound LSR</a> is the result of <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/a10209/the-1000-mph-car-does-not-exist-yet-16577046/?click=main_sr"><u>10 years of meticulous building</u></a>.</li>
        <li>After a 2018 brush with bankruptcy, the car is back and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/11/land-speed-car-begins-testing-beats-500mph-with-one-just-engine/"><u>testing at 500 mph</u></a> this month.</li>
        <li>Jet cars are <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/car-technology/a28844759/land-speed-racing-danger-jessi-combs-death/">wildly dangerous</a>, but driver and RAF officer Andy Green is a <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/g1790/land-speed-racing-records-jessi-combs-death/">record-holding veteran</a>.</li>

      <p>This week brought an important update on the <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/a25471425/1000-mph-bloodhound-ssc-project-dead/">Bloodhound LSR</a> car, which broke 500 miles per hour (mph) on a test track in Africa on Wednesday, according to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/11/land-speed-car-begins-testing-beats-500mph-with-one-just-engine/"><i><u>Ars Technica</u></i></a>. The Bloodhound’s owners will continue escalating test speeds until they reach the car’s planned 1,000 mph in 2020. The tests are being conducted on a specially prepared series of straightaways on a dry lakebed in South Africa.</p>
      <p>This test is satisfying for the Bloodhound team as well as its followers, because the project has been plagued with problems for almost its entire lifetime. Modern land-speed cars are already arguably more like fighter jets than automobiles, with giant jet engines fitted to streamlined bodies with wings. The Bloodhound has “<a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/car-technology/a13977736/when-you-go-1000-mph-the-tires-arent-even-rubber-anymore/"><u>forged aerospace aluminum</u></a>” tires to try to partly combat the generation of artificial microgravity by how fast the tires are spinning. It’s also being piloted—er, driven—by Royal Air Force Wing Commander Andy Green.</p>
      <p>With jet engines, wings, and speeds over 500 mph, land-speed cars are tempting fate from their very inception. Green worked on the direct predecessor to the Bloodhound, the Thrust SSC, which broke the land-speed record and the sound barrier in 1997.</p>
      <p>In 2009, <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/a4514/4329411/"><i><u>Popular Mechanics</u></i><u> talked with Green</u></a> and the Thrust-Bloodhound team to explain their then-new Bloodhound SSC project. After breaking the sound barrier, what more <i>were</i> they trying to do? The ceiling on speed seemed to be right there. “Even the low-level air-speed record, which is no longer contested, stands at 994 mph,” we reported back then. How could they go faster than that on land?</p>
      <p>In 2014, English caught up with the Bloodhound gang again for <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/a10209/the-1000-mph-car-does-not-exist-yet-16577046/?click=main_sr"><u>a </u><i><u>Pop Mech</u></i><u> cover story</u></a>. They said they were on schedule and under budget, with necessary changes like front-wheel steering instead of the wild rear-wheel steering that almost thwarted the Thrust’s record run. Among other things, this showed that the Bloodhound was truly a new design.</p>
      <p>Driving these cars is massively dangerous—women’s land speed record holder Jessi Combs <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/car-technology/a28844759/land-speed-racing-danger-jessi-combs-death/"><u>was killed just this year</u></a>, and the Vampire jet car was totaled <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/oct/23/broadcasting.uknews"><u>in a near-death crash</u></a> with <i>Top Gear</i>’s Richard Hammond behind the wheel at “just” 288 mph in 2006. The difference between wrestling with rear-wheel steering versus the control of front-wheel steering could be life and death, let alone the record itself.</p>
      <p>In 2014, Bloodhound SSC mentioned employing people to move 6,000 tons of rock off the area of the track. By 2018, mounting costs had drained Bloodhound coffers and forced them to put <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/a25471425/1000-mph-bloodhound-ssc-project-dead/"><u>the entire project up for sale</u></a>. “Perhaps some plutocrat with dollars to burn and dancing visions of breaking records will swoop in to fund Green and company,” we wrote at the time.</p>
      <p>Months later, like manna from heaven, a wealthy entrepreneur <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/car-technology/a29354365/bloodhound-lsr-south-africa-test-2019/"><u>arrived to save Bloodhound</u></a>. Renamed Bloodhound LSR (land speed record), this revived team got back to work, including finalizing plans to test at 500 mph this month.</p>
      <p>All their careful planning and materials testing has paid off so far. Green <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/11/land-speed-car-begins-testing-beats-500mph-with-one-just-engine/"><u>told </u><i><u>Ars Technica</u></i></a> that at “slow speed” (below 200 mph) the car handles like a regular car on a snowy road, and above that, it’s like “an ice rink.” That’s under ideal conditions with the best and most advanced tires, the front-wheel steering Green insisted on, and the track made surreally smooth by people removing rocks by hand. With his previous, still-standing record in hand, Green seems as ready as he’ll ever be.</p>
