      <h2>Tenants are unaware that if their contract is renewed, their landlord must now return any part of the deposit that exceeds 5 weeks' rent back to them - here's why</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T16:30:42+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 16:30</time> by <a rel="author">Emma Munbodh, https://www.facebook.com/EmmaMunbodh</a></address>
      <p>Thousands of tenants could be owed refunds on their deposit fees because of new legislation introduced earlier this year.</p>
      <p>The Tenancy Deposit Scheme (TDS) said it has seen average returns of £320.27 for renters who've signed new contracts since the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/tenancy-fees-officially-banned-today-16225023">Tenant Fees Act 2019 came into force on June 1, 2019</a> , giving them stronger rights against law breaking landlords and agents.</p>
      <p>Among many things, the new guidelines mean that security deposits are capped at a maximum of five weeks’ rent for tenancies with an annual rent of less than £50,000 - or a maximum of six weeks’ rent for tenancies where annual rent is £50,000 or more.</p>
      <p>This means that in cases where the same tenancy is renewed, the landlord or agent must return any part of the deposit that exceeds the deposit cap back to the tenant.</p>
      <p>The Tenancy Deposit Scheme (TDS) is the only deposit protection scheme to have an online solution to facilitate the deposit cap refund process.</p>

      <p>It said on average, private renters have benefited from an average refund of £320.</p>
      <p>Debbie Davies, at the TDS, said: "We reviewed data from when the legislation was first introduced in order to establish how frequently deposits are being partially repaid by agents or landlords.</p>
      <p>"During this period we have made 2,550 repayments totalling £817,031.33.  From delving deeper into the figures we identified the average payment was £320.27 and the highest repayment to a tenant was £3,384.62.</p>
      <p>"We believe the deposit cap is having the effect intended by Parliament, with the deposit held being reduced upon renewal, which is great news for renters."</p>
      <p>The Tenancy Deposit Scheme (TDS) is a Government-approved protection scheme. </p>
      <p>It is the only not-for-profit tenancy deposit scheme in the UK, which impartially protects deposits on behalf of renters, landlords and agents.</p>
      <h3>What rights do I have?</h3>
      <p>If you're on an assured shorthold tenancy, your deposit must be protected in a tenancy deposit scheme until you move out of the property.</p>
      <p>This is a legal requirement on your landlord's part, and means if they unfairly try to claim your deposit at the end of your contract, you can dispute it through a third party.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere new rules now mean private tenants can now apply for a refund of up to 12 months’ rent if their landlord does not deal with health and safety hazards in their home. It's part of wider plans to make homes safer for millions of tenants - and includes the right to smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors.</p>
      <p>If your landlord is trying to charge you for a service you weren't aware of - such as garden maintenance - refer to your contract and check if it's listed there first. If it's not, the charges won't stand up. We've got a full guide on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/get-deposit-back-landlord-10529595">how to get your deposit back in full, here</a> .</p>
