      <p>Ontario elementary school teachers are now in a legal position to strike in 17 days if a deal cannot be reached with the province.</p>
      <p>On Friday, the Elementary Teachers’ Federation of Ontario (ETFO) said that it has received a no-board report from the Ministry of Labour.</p>
      <p>“ETFO is fighting for investment, not cuts in education, but Doug Ford’s Education Minister Stephen Lecce isn’t listening,” said ETFO president Sam Hammond in a statement.</p>
      <p>“While ETFO is now in a legal position to take strike action in 17 days, we will continue to focus on contract talks in an attempt to arrive at a deal that improves student learning conditions and educator working conditions.”</p>
      <p>Elementary school teachers <a href="https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/ontario-public-elementary-teachers-vote-98-per-cent-in-favour-of-strike-1.4665969">voted 98 per cent</a> in favour of strike action two weeks ago.</p>
      <p>The no-board report was granted the day after the province passed a bill in the Legislature capping public sector wage increases to one per cent a year, for the next three years.</p>
      <p>The unions representing Ontario teachers are preparing to <a href="https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/ontario-passes-bill-to-cap-public-sector-wage-increases-at-one-per-cent-1.4675970">challenge the government</a> in court over the legislation.</p>
