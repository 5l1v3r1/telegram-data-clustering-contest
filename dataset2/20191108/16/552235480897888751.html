      <p>A woman who torched her own flat while her boyfriend was asleep inside has been jailed for 18 months for what a sheriff called an act of "gross and irresponsible criminality".</p>
      <p>Nicola Garrick was photographed by a neighbour setting fire to something and pushing the burning material through the letterbox of her home in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/bathgate">Bathgate</a> , West Lothian.</p>
      <p>The fire took hold and caused thousands of pounds worth of damage to the building, but luckily the emergency services arrived in time to extinguish the flames.</p>
      <p>Garrick, 41, of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/livingston">Livingston</a> , was originally charged with deliberately starting the fire at Marina Road, Bathgate, on November 6 last year knowing that Jason Scott was in the building at the time.</p>
      <p>The prosecution also alleged that she was responsible for injuring Tracy Lewis, another occupant of the building, who allegedly suffered from smoke inhalation.</p>

      <p>However, the prosecution accepted her denial of those two elements of the indictment but insisted she had caused danger to people living in adjoining properties.</p>
      <p>Garrick earlier pled guilty to wilful fire raising. A not guilty plea to breaching bail conditions by being in the company Mr Scott on April 13 this year was accepted.</p>
      <p>Cat Jagla, prosecuting, said that both Garrick and her then-boyfriend had been drinking and taking drugs earlier that day but he had gone back to the flat ahead of her.</p>
      <p>She said Jason's memory of the incident was not clear but he recalled being aware of smoke when he awoke in a bed and the accused telling him the flat was on <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-fire-and-rescue-service">fire</a> .</p>
      <p>Three neighbours told police they saw Garrick kicking and banging on her front door shouting: “Jason” and walking around the property banging on windows calling for him before the blaze started.</p>
      <p>One neighbour heard her say: “Jason, Jason, f**king let me in!” through the letterbox as she tried in vain to gain entry.</p>
      <p>The neighbour then saw Garrick with a lighter of some sort sparking flames and two others saw her at her door shouting: “Fire!” before walking away.</p>
      <p>Several neighbours dialled 999 and police, ambulance personnel and 17 fire fighters attended and quickly brought the fire under control.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/police">Police</a> later interviewed Garrick who at first claimed she couldn’t remember anything about what had happened.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>She later admitted she and her ex-partner had taken Valium at a friend’s home and had taken a bus back to her home in Boghall, Bathgate, carrying a bag of cushions and pillows the friend had given them.</p>
      <p>The prosecutor said: “She told officers that Mr Scott walked faster on the way to the house and when she got home she couldn’t access the property because Mr Scott had the house key.</p>
      <p>“The accused stated that she was banging on the door of the property in the hope that she would wake him.</p>
      <p>“She denied setting fire to anything saying she wouldn’t have done that to try and wake him up.</p>
      <p>“She couldn’t provide any explanation as to how the house came to be on fire, stating: ‘Why would I set fire to my own house? It’s all I’ve got.’</p>
      <p>“She was shown the photograph taken by a neighbour and confirmed it did look like her then became emotional and said: ‘I’ve never done anything like this in my life’. I’m sorry to my neighbours if it caused that much damage.</p>
      <p>“She said she had no intention of hurting anyone.”</p>
      <p>Dan Cameron, defending, said his client had reacted with disbelief that she could have acted in that manner but fully accepted she was responsible.</p>
      <p>He said: “She understands the potential harm there could have been and is grateful there was no further harm than there was. This was an isolated incident.”</p>
      <p>He asked the court to view the offence as a “spontaneous act’ carried out while she was under the influence of alcohol and substances as opposed to something which had been planned in advance.</p>
      <p>He said she was a vulnerable person who had significant difficulties as a result of trauma which negatively affected her ability to function in society.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Sentencing Garrick to 18 months in prison, Sheriff Douglas Kinloch told her: “In a bizarre and inexplicable act which you claim to have no memory of, you deliberately set fire to your own house in the early hours of morning.</p>
      <p>“Quite unbelievably it appears you did this not knowing whether your partner was in the house or not and seemingly not caring about the residents in other flats in the adjoining block of flats.</p>
      <p>“It’s only through good fortune that neighbours saw what you were doing and called the fire brigade.</p>
      <p>“As a result no-one was actually injured and the fire was kept under control.”</p>
      <p>The sheriff went on: “What was absolutely clear is that this was an act of gross and irresponsible criminality.</p>
      <p>“Had luck not been on your side the consequences could have been unimaginable.”</p>
