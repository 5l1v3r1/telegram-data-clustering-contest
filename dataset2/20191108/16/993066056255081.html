      <p>It is understood that contracts for the central London real estate will pass to Mitsubishi Estate London Limited.</p>
      <p>The studios were the home of morning television staples, including This Morning, Lorraine, and Good Morning Britain.</p>
      <p>In a statement posted online, ITV plc said: “ITV has today exchanged contracts for the sale of the London Television Centre on the South Bank to Mitsubishi Estate London Limited in an all-cash transaction for £145.6m. Completion is expected to occur by the end of November.”</p>
      <p>Part of the proceeds from the sale will go in part towards reducing ITV’s “net debt”.</p>
      <p>ITV’s morning television shows have relocated to White City in the West End of London.</p>
