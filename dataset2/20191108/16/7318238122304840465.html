      <h1>1989: Europe and the wall</h1>

      <p>It’s 30 years since Berliners tore down that wall, a wall that divided a city, effectively a country and symbolized a divided Europe.</p>
      <p>And here at the European Parliament we’ve been talking to people about their memories of that momentous night</p>
      <p>And what about MEPs - well we spoke to one, Hannah Neuman, a German Green, then a child, about what that night meant to her</p>
      <p>But in the three decades since the fall of the Berlin Wall, European countries have actually built more - in fact about 1,000 kilometres of NEW border walls and fences in different parts of the continent as we’ve been finding out</p>
      <p>That’s it for this week, next week, it’s election fever, with fallout from Spain’s fourth vote in four years, the UK will be in full campaign mode, with their third election in since 2015 and Romania is also going to the polls</p>
      <p>Full coverage of that and much more on Euronews and Euronews.com</p>
      <p>But we will leave you with those momentous pictures from three decades ago, the moment the world changed.</p>
