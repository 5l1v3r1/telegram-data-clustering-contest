      <p>Each year a group of selfless volunteers agrees to play what some call the world's most boring video game for hours on end in an attempt to raise money for the Child's Play hospital charity. Now in its 13th year, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016/11/12/desert-bus-10-charity/">Desert Bus for Hope</a> fundraiser kicked off today. In its first five hours, it has raised nearly $80,000.</p>
      <p>For those who don't know, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016/01/14/desert-bus-vr-sequel/"><i>Desert Bus</i></a> is a never-released game from <i>Penn &amp; Teller's Smoke and Mirrors</i>. Players must drive a virtual bus from Tucson, Arizona, to Las Vegas, Nevada. When they reach their destination, they're awarded one point and asked if they want to make the trip back. This year a team of 60 volunteers will take turns driving the bus back and forth on that eight-hour trip until the donations stop.</p>
      <p>Their fellow volunteers will attempt to save them from boredom with song, dance, human pyramids, etc. You can watch it all unfold <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/desertbus">on Twitch</a>, and you can donate at <a href="https://desertbus.org/">DesertBus.org</a>. To-date, Desert Bus for Hope has raised more than $5 million for Child's Play.</p>
      <p><b>Update 11/8/19 7:45PM ET: </b>Desert Bus for Hope has now raised more than $5 million over 13 years.</p>
