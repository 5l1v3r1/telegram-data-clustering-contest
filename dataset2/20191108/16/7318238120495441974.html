      <p>A rare baby giraffe made his public debut at a northern Czech zoo earlier this week, just 12 days after being born in the enclosure.</p>
      <p>He was born on 25 October at Liberec Zoo and belongs to the Rothschild's Giraffe sub-species, of which there are thought to be fewer than 2,000 still living in the wild, according to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.</p>
      <p>Unveiled on Wednesday, the as-yet-unnamed baby already stands 190cm tall and weighs around 60 kilograms.</p>
      <p>Zoo director David Nejedlo said the baby's mother had also been born in the zoo, which has been breeding the animals for more than 30 years.</p>
      <p>Forty-six giraffes have been born in the zoo since that time, and the current herd number is four – two adult females, another youngster aged two years, and the new arrival.</p>
      <p>Numbers of giraffes living in the wild in African countries are decreasing, making breeding programmes in zoos more and more important, according to Nejeldo.</p>
