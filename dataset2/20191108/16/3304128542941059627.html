      <p>On Tuesday October 22, the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP) Noordin Haji warned lawmakers against making amendments to the bill that if passed would block access into private data, a move that would greatly affect the fight and war against corruption.</p>
      <p>However, on Friday November 8, President Uhuru Kenyatta signed the Data Protection Bill 2019 into law.</p>
      <p>The new established law puts into consideration the office of the Data Commissioner with set requirements and standards for the protection of personal data generated by both public and private institutions.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the law outlines key principles that assign roles to data controllers and processors hence setting conditions for transfer of personal data outside Kenya, with certain exemptions that can be followed.</p>
