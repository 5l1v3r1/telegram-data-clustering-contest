        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lewis-hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> may be a six-time Formula 1 World Champion but that doesn't stop him striving for more. The Brit has insisted there is still more for him to master as he targets even more titles.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hamilton won his sixth Drivers' Championship and his third in as many seasons when he finished second at the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/grandsprix/united-states-grand-prix">United States Grand Prix</a>. Since 2014 the former <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mclaren">McLaren</a> driver has won five of the six Drivers' Championships. The only time he missed out was the 2016 season which was won by his then-teammate, Nico Rosberg.</p>
      <p>Hamilton is showing no signs of slowing down and is targeting another World Championship in 2020. Despite debatably being the greatest driver of all time he's still targeting improvement.</p>

      <p><i>"I tried to make sure that I've started the season as I finished last year and I think that's just stayed through the season,"</i> said Hamilton as quoted by Autosport.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"I've been very consistent in qualifying. I've not had particularly spectacular pole positions that perhaps I did last year, but it's been second row the majority of the time.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"Apart from Hockenheim but I'll give myself a pass for that weekend because I wasn't really 100% - I think it's been the best performing year.</i>
