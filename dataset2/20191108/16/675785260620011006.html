      <h2>A 5.9-magnitude tremor struck in north-western Iran in the early hours of today in East Azerbaijan province, Iran's Seismological Center said and there have been dozens of aftershocks</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T16:34:08+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 16:34</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Davidson, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/tom-davidson/</a></address>
      <p>At least five people were killed and hundreds were injured after an earthquake struck north-western Iran, according to officials.</p>
      <p>Pictures show houses that have been destroyed by the 5.9-magnitude tremor which struck in the early hours of Friday in East Azerbaijan province.</p>
      <p>Most of the injuries were caused by crowd stampedes according to state-run TV reports but this has not been independently verified.</p>
      <p>The Middle East country sits on two major tectonic plates and is prone to seismic activity.</p>
      <p>More than 26,000 people were killed by a catastrophic 6.6 magnitude earthquake in 2003 which destroyed the historic city of Bam in the south-east of the country.</p>

      <p>Today's quake struck near the town of Tark, some 400km (250 miles) north-west of the capital Tehran, at 2:17am local time (22.47 GMT).</p>
      <p>As well as killing five people, the quake injured 312 - though only a dozen or more of them required treatment in hospital.</p>
      <p>Iran's emergency medical services chief, Pirhossein Kolivand, told state TV: "Rescue teams and helicopters have been dispatched to the quake-hit areas and hospitals are on full alert to help injured people.</p>

      <p>State-run IRINN TV said most of the injuries were due to overcrowding as people rushed out of their homes and into the streets in panic.</p>
      <p>Up to 30 homes were destroyed near the epicentre, it added.</p>
      <p>More than 60 aftershocks have been reported.</p>

      <p>Rescue workers are operating in 41 villages, but most of the damage was concentrated in the two villages of Varnakesh and Varzaghan, according to provincial governor Mohammad-Reza Pourmohammadi.</p>
      <p>Emergency services have been distributing survival kits, cooking equipment, blankets and tents, according to AFP news agency.</p>
      <p>Tremors were reportedly felt as far away as Tehran.</p>
