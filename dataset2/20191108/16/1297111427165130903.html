      <p>Police are looking for Harley Quinn.</p>
      <p>Not Gotham Police — the Regina Police Service.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="http://reginapolice.ca/2019/11/can-you-identify-harley-quinn/">The RPS “is looking to identify a possible witness to an incident that occurred in the early morning hours of Oct. 27” outside a bar on the 600 block of Victoria Avenue.</a>
      </p>
      <p>Police did not provide any information about the incident in question.</p>
      <p>However, police say the possible witness was dressed as DC Comics character Harley Quinn, but have no more specifics about the costume. Police believe she may have information to identify a suspect.</p>
      <p>There is no indication police are looking for the Joker.</p>
      <p>The character first appeared in Batman: The Animated Series and was most recently portrayed by Margot Robbie in the 2016 Suicide Squad live-action film.</p>
