      <p>That had to hurt.</p>
      <p>Security cam footage captured a burglar crashing through the ceiling of a Venutra County, California, restaurant on Oct. 31. The woman is seen hitting her head on metal kitchen equipment.</p>
      <p>She was slow to get up, but eventually continued with the burglary, along with a male accomplice.</p>

      <p>The video was released by the county's sheriff's office earlier this week in hopes of finding the pair of burglars.</p>
      <p>The woman who crashed through the ceiling is described as a white or Hispanic female, approximately 5-feet-6 to 5-feet-8 in height, 110-130 pounds, 18-25 years old, with bleached blonde colored hair and dark colored roots.</p>
      <p>A male suspect also seen in the video is described as a white male, approximately 5-feet-8 to 6-feet in height, 160-190 pounds, 20-25 years old with short brown or dark colored hair.</p>
      <p>The sheriff's office said several hundred dollars and numerous bottles of wine were stolen from the business.</p>
