      <p>A dog had it's neck slashed before being dumped in the woods near <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/midlothian-council">Bonnyrigg</a> .</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dogs">American bulldog</a> was discovered wrapped in a blanket and tied up around 3pm on November 5 by a member of the public.</p>
      <p>SSPCA say the dog was subjected to a "sustained and deliberate" attack with a knife.</p>
      <p>The deep wound could only have been caused with a "considerable amount of force".</p>
      <p>They added the female dog was otherwise in good condition and had been cared for properly before it's death.</p>
      <p>The animal charity is appealing for information from anyone who recognises the dog after a mircochip was traced back to an address in the Edinburgh area.</p>
      <p>Inspector Tracey Dow said: “The female dog is a white and tan American bull dog.</p>
      <p>“From the scene where the dog was found we are able to ascertain that she was killed elsewhere and then driven here to dispose of the body.</p>
      <p>“We would like to determine the circumstances surrounding the dog’s death. It is a criminal offence to harm or kill an animal and we are keen to find the person responsible.</p>
      <p>“If anyone can help with our enquiry, we would urge them to call our confidential animal helpline on 03000 999 999.” </p>
