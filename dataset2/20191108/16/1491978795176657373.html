      <p>On <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/jimmy-kimmel">Jimmy Kimmel</a> Live!, the host mentioned that this week makes three years since Trump was voted into office. “It’s been smooth sailing ever since,” he joked.</p>
      <p>Kimmel continued: “Trump plans to celebrate the anniversary tomorrow by playing golf then making love to an overcooked steak with ketchup on it.”</p>
      <p>On three separate occasions in the last week, Trump has used the word “foistered” during rallies, a word that he appears to have invented. “It’s a combination of foisted and forced which also happens to be his two favourite ways to meet women,” Kimmel quipped.</p>
      <p>He then moved onto a new report in the Washington Post which claims that Trump’s attorney general, Bill Barr, refused to take part in a press conference about the Ukraine call. Trump responded with a number of “rage-tweets” aimed at the paper. “Does he ever do any actual president work? Or is it all just rallies and tweets now?” Kimmel asked.</p>
      <p>In one of the tweets, Trump criticised the media for not using fact-checkers anymore. “Donald Trump claiming the media doesn’t fact-check is like R Kelly calling Chris Brown a creep,” he joked.</p>
      <p>A vote on impeachment might happen before Christmas although Kimmel has a better idea. “Why not do it on Christmas?” he said. “That way we can start a new tradition of rewatching it every year.”</p>
      <p>The basis of the inquiry is Trump trying to get information that didn’t even exist in the first place. “Trump tried to pull off a heist on a casino with no money in it, like a Trump casino,” Kimmel said.</p>
      <h3>Stephen Colbert</h3>

      <p>On The Late Show, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/stephen-colbert">Stephen Colbert</a> started with some good news: Stephen Miller is getting married. “Wow, love truly is blind,” he said. “I’d like to congratulate the happy couple and if you want to give them a gift they are registered at and it just says snakes, I don’t know what that means.”</p>
      <p>He also spoke about Barr’s refusal to assist the president. “Bill Barr refused to publicly defend the president?” he said. “Something is seriously wrong. That’s like Nicolas Cage turning down a movie role.”</p>
      <p>Colbert then moved onto the angry tweets that followed the Washington Post report. “There’s only one way to make sure a story about Trump and that’s if he rage-tweets his denial,” he said.</p>
      <p>During a recent rally, Trump said to his audience that they probably couldn’t think of anywhere else they would rather be at that moment. Colbert had other ideas: “The DMV, the dentist, someone else’s child’s clarinet recital, a Soviet gulag, covered in honey and staked to an ant hill, sliding down a 50ft razor blade into a bathtub of gun and in conversation with someone who knows a lot about Bitcoin.”</p>
      <h3>Seth Meyers</h3>

      <p>On Late Night, Seth Meyers also spoke about Trump’s use of the word foistered. “Trump doesn’t make errors he makes discoveries,” he joked.</p>
      <p>Meyers continued: “He sounds like Daffy Duck trying to say faster.”</p>
      <p>He claimed that Trump is “surrounded by so many sycophants” that no one would correct him before playing footage of Lindsey Graham also making a number of mistakes on a recent Fox News interview. “Trump and Graham sound like two guys leaving a bar at 4am arguing who should drive home,” he said.</p>
      <p>The last week has also seen two Democratic governors win in Kentucky and Virginia which has led to a Republican source stating that this could be a bad omen for 2020. “You guys really needed an omen to tell you things were not looking good?” Meyers said. “Republicans are like Ancient Egyptians trying to predict the seasons.”</p>
