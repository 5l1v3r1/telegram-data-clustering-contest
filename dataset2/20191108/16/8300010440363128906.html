      <p>CLIFFS OF MOHER, Ireland -- It's something you've probably never seen before - a waterfall appearing to flow backward!<br/><br/>The waterfalls at the Cliffs of Moher in Ireland are a sight to behold. They seem to defy the laws of gravity, but there is a simple explanation.<br/><br/>The winds on the west coast of Ireland are so strong that they can sometimes push the water against its natural trajectory.<br/><br/>Garry McNabb was on a hike with friends when he recorded the video, which shows some of the waterfall spraying back up onto the cliffs.<br/><br/>Although the weather was not all sunshine and rainbows, McNabb got to experience a rare phenomenon in a beautiful setting, which made for a scenic hike with friends.</p>
