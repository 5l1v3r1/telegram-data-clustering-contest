      <h1>Turkey threatens to send foreign Isis suspects home from next week</h1>

        <i>Interior minister said repatriation of alleged terrorists would include those rendered stateless</i>
      </p>
      <p>Turkey will begin deporting foreign members of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/isis">Islamic State</a> in Turkish custody back to their home countries from next week, the country’s interior minister has said.</p>
      <p>Ankara has repeatedly criticised European nations for refusing to take back any of the 1,200 foreign nationals currently held in Turkish prisons on suspicion of links to the terror organisation.</p>
      <p>“Now we are telling you that we are going to send [members of Isis] back to you. We are starting this on Monday,” Süleyman Soylu said in Ankara on Friday.</p>
      <p>In earlier comments, Soylu said repatriation efforts would also include individuals who have had their European citizenship revoked and are legally stateless.</p>
      <p>“Countries can’t just revoke the citizenship of such ex-terrorists and expect <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey">Turkey</a> to take care of them; this is unacceptable to us and it’s also irresponsible,” he told reporters on 2 November. “Turkey is not a hotel for foreign terrorists.”</p>
      <p>The logistics of the policy remain unclear. Some countries request passenger manifests for both military and commercial flights in advance before a plane is allowed to enter their airspace. It is also unlikely that Turkey will be able to repatriate those who have lost their citizenship.</p>

      <p>It was also not immediately clear whether the policy would extend to Aine Davis, one of the British jihadists who beheaded hostages in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria">Syria</a> as part of the infamous cell known as “The Beatles”. Davis was sentenced by Turkish authorities to seven-and-a-half years in jail in 2017 after his capture in Istanbul in 2015.</p>
      <p>Shiraz Maher, director of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King’s College London, said: “On a practical level I don’t see how Turkish authorities can enforce this. I suspect the British government will simply refuse aircraft carrying these individuals.”</p>
      <p>Turkey’s interior and foreign ministries did not respond to requests for comment before publication.</p>
      <p>Soylu said Turkey was holding almost 1,200 foreign members of Isis in custody and had captured a further 287, including women and children, during its recent invasion of Kurdish-held territory in northern Syria.</p>
      <p>Tooba Gondal, a 25-year-old British woman important to the group’s online recruitment efforts, is currently believed to be in Turkish custody in Syria after escaping a Kurdish-run detention camp in the chaos caused by the fighting.</p>
      <p>The minister’s remarks follow reports last month that two Dutch women suspected of Isis membership who fled a Syrian detention camp visited their country’s embassy in Ankara with their children, requesting to be sent home.</p>
      <p>They were arrested by Turkish authorities and the Netherlands swiftly said one of the women – a dual Dutch-Morrocan citizen – had been stripped of Dutch nationality.</p>
      <p>Since 2010 the UK has stripped more than 100 people of British citizenship over their alleged links to Isis, al-Qaida, al-Shabab and other terrorist groups.</p>
      <p>Although under a 1961 international convention it is illegal to leave someone stateless, several countries, including the UK and France, have not ratified it. Recent high-profile cases, such as those of Shamima Begum and Jack Letts, have triggered prolonged legal battles.</p>
