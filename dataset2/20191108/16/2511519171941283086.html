      <p>A woman nearly died from an allergic reaction after having sex with her husband, </p>
      <p>The 46-year-old from <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Baltimore">Baltimore</a>, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Maryland">Maryland</a>, suffered an anaphylactic reaction to a medication her husband was taking through exposure to her husband’s semen, according to <a href="https://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(19)30253-0/fulltext#s0010">the case report in the <i>American Journal of Medicine</i></a>.</p>
      <p>The report, titled “Almost Killed by Love: A Cautionary Coital Tale”, said she complained of dizziness, diarrhoea, itchy hands and feet, and severe sweating shortly afterwards.</p>
      <p>The woman went to A&amp;E and doctors initially believed she was suffering from sepsis due to her low blood pressure and she was put on an IV drip and given various antibiotics.</p>
      <p>However, further tests revealed she was suffering from anaphylactic shock.</p>
      <p>It was found that her husband had been treating a bacterial infection with a course of an antibiotic called nafcillin, which contains <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/penicillin">penicillin</a>.</p>
      <p>The woman had a history of <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/penicillin-allergy">penicillin allergy</a> since she was a child and said she had not been exposed to penicillin since then.</p>
      <p>The authors said they believe the woman was “exposed to nafcillin concentrated in the seminal fluid”.</p>
      <p>After her blood pressure normalised and her symptoms improved, the woman was discharged from hospital with an epipen.</p>
      <p>She was instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse with her husband until at least one week after he completed his course of antibiotics.</p>
      <p>The authors wrote: “We have reported a case of an anaphylactic reaction to nafcillin in a penicillin-allergic patient via vaginal exposure to the antibiotic contained within her partner’s semen. While we were unable to obtain a specimen from the patient’s husband to confirm detectable levels of nafcillin in her partner’s semen, the patient’s clinical presentation coupled with the onset of symptoms post-coitus leads us to believe she was exposed to nafcillin concentrated in the seminal fluid.”</p>
      <p>They said it was the third time such an averse reaction was documented in a medical journal.</p>
      <p>The authors advised those writing prescriptions to “take into account the hazards of allergic reactions and adverse side effects, not only for the patient but also for the patient’s family”.</p>
