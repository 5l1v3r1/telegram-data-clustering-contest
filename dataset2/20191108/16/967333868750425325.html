        <b>WASHINGTON (Sputnik) - The Pentagon on Friday denied reports that a US drone was shot down by Iranian defence forces in the province of Khuzestan, saying all American military equipment in the area is accounted for.</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>"Alleged reports of a US drone being shot down are incorrect," US Central Command (CENTCOM) wrote on Twitter. "If an Unmanned Aircraft System {UAS) had gone down in the CENTCOM [area] it was not a DoD asset. All US equipment has been accounted for".</blockquote>

      <p>​The Iranian military earlier on Friday said that the country's <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201911081077255598-iran-reportedly-downs-drone-over-southern-port-in-persian-gulf/">air defence forces had downed a foreign drone</a> near Mahshahr port in the country's Khuzestan province, ISNA news agency reported. It was unclear, however, whether the UAV was military or civilian.</p>
      <p>The news comes amid a new escalation of tensions, as Tehran reportedly notified the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) that three Iranian oil tankers have been attacked during the last six months.</p>

      <p>This is the second time this year that Iran has reported downing an American drone. At the same time, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201911071077243995-iran-cancels-accreditation-of-un-inspector-after-allegedly-triggering-alarm-at-nuclear-facility/">Washington is continuing to boost its forces in the region.</a></p>
      <p>The US previously established a maritime coalition to prevent attacks near the Strait of Hormuz after several incidents involving cargo ships in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman.</p>
