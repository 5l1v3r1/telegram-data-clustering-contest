      <h1>Trump may attend Russia Victory Day in May with Putin at Kremlin in Moscow</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T16:48:04+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 16:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/xeni_jardin" target="_blank">Xeni Jardin</a></address>
      <p>Traitorous Trump is making spring travel plans with Vladimir Putin.</p>
      <p>On Friday, acting U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters he has tentative plans to attend Russia's official state Victory Day commemorative events in Moscow, after President Vladimir Putin extended an invitation to the May 9 festivities at the Kremlin.</p>
      <p>Putin murders and jails human rights advocates, journalists, and anyone who opposes him and the kleptocracy he runs.</p>
      <p>Russia threatens and attacks its neighbors, the Ukraine and Baltic States, and has attacked our 2016 elections, which gave us Trump.</p>
      <p>“I appreciate the invitation. It is right in the middle of political season, so I’ll see if I can do it, but I would love to go if I could,” Trump said to reporters before leaving the White House on Air Force One, for 2020 campaign events.</p>

      <blockquote>Putin presides over an annual parade to commemorate the Soviet Union’s World War Two victory over Nazi Germany, but the Kremlin has said next year’s 75th anniversary would be marked with great pomp.<br/><br/>Trump called it “a very big deal celebrating the end of the war.”<br/><br/>Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov was cited by RIA news agency as saying on Thursday that Putin’s invitation to his U.S. counterpart to attend Victory Day in Moscow had been “received with interest,” but there had not yet been any reply from the White House.</blockquote>
      <p>No surprises here.</p>
