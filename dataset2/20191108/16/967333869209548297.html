      <p>Tickling the funny bones of his 51.2 million followers, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911071077245160-india-issues-countrywide-alert-dispatches-troops-ahead-of-communally-sensitive-ayodhya-verdict/">India’s leading man Narendra Modi</a> has asked the founder of Bridgewater Dalio to meditate and channel his inner Ninja, as he will likely to be trolled for his words of praise to Modi.</p>

      <p>​The American billionaire investor posted the video of their sit-down discussion with Modi on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Sharing the link to the video, he had tweeted, “In my opinion, India’s Prime Minister Modi is one of the best, if not the best, leaders in the world. I had an opportunity to explore with him how he thinks as well as what he thinks. If you’re interested in listening to it, here it is”.</p>

      <p>The reply has amused his followers, who hailed him for his “savage” reply to trollers and compared him to Donald Trump by saying he "pulled a slight Trump". While many said that Modi could give comedians a run for the money.</p>
