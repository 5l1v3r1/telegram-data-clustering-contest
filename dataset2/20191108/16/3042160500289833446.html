      <p>It’s safe to say that a lot of people didn’t see this coming.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/1192662679162441728">According</a> to the NFL Network, <a href="http://atlantablackstar.com/tag/deion-sanders/"><b>Deion Sanders</b></a> is one of the candidates being considered for the head football coaching job at Florida State University, where he played football, baseball and ran track from 1986 to 1988. His No. 2 football jersey was also retired at the University in 1995.</p>
      <p>The school recently fired its former head coach Willie Taggart, who was there for two years after replacing Jimbo Fisher.</p>

      <p>After leaving college, Sanders began his professional careers in football and baseball in 1989. In football he was a six-time All-Pro cornerback and won two Super Bowls, first with the San Francisco 49ers, then with the Dallas Cowboys. That same year he scored a touchdown and hit a home run in the same week, being the only person ever to do so.</p>
      <p>Sanders also played in a World Series in 1992 with the Atlanta Braves, and he’s the only person ever to play in both a World Series and a Super Bowl.</p>
      <p>After news hit that he was being considered for the head coaching job at FSU, a lot of the school’s fans said it would be an ideal move.</p>
      <p>“FSU make this happen,” someone wrote.</p>
      <p>“Been a fan of FSU football since I can recall,” another person chimed in. “Be a blessing for the young men to learn not only football skills but especially life skills from a man like primetime. Football Program would only mirror the reflection of change he could impart.”</p>
      <p>“I believe your the coach for that job,” a third person wrote. “Surround yourself with the best coaches and recruiters. Also get state of the art facilities that’s a MUST !! and put that program back on the map. College football needs that program to be relevant again!!! Rocking with you PRIME !!”</p>
      <p>Today, Sanders is a host for the NFL Network on its show “NFL GameDay Prime.”</p>
