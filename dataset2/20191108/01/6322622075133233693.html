      <p>TOKYO (Nov 8): U.S. crude oil futures fell on Friday amid fading hopes that a deal to end the lingering trade war between Washington and Beijing would be signed any time soon, the gloom compounded by rising crude inventories in the United States.</p>
      <p>U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was down 15 cents, or 0.2%, at $57 a barrel by 0032 GMT. The contract rose 1.4% on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Brent crude, the global benchmark, was yet to trade after gaining 0.9% in the previous session.</p>
      <p>The trade war between the world's two biggest economies has slowed economic growth around the world and prompted analysts to lower forecasts for oil demand, raising concerns that a supply glut could develop in 2020.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, the Chinese commerce ministry said the two countries have agreed in the past two weeks to cancel trade tariffs in different phases, without giving a timeline.</p>
      <p>But that comment was shrouded in doubt soon after when Reuters reported that the plan faces stiff internal opposition in the U.S. administration.</p>
      <p>Still, Brent is up almost 16% in 2019, supported by a deal between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies such as Russia to limit supplies until March next year. The producers meet on Dec. 5-6 in Vienna to review the policy.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile there is "lingering concern about a rise in inventories in the U.S. last week," ANZ said in a note.</p>
      <p>U.S. crude oil stockpiles rose sharply last week as refineries cut output and exports dropped, while refined products extended a multi-week drawdown, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for WTI rose by 1.7 million barrels, the EIA said. - Reuters</p>
