      <p>When Obsidian Entertainment launched its anticipated action RPG <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/outer_worlds">The Outer Worlds</a></b> last month, there was no sign of the Switch release.</p>
      <p>Not long after this, a press release from the game's publisher Private Division <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/10/the_outer_worlds_wont_be_released_on_switch_until_next_year">revealed</a> the hybrid version would be arriving at some point in 2020, leading to the belief the game would launch on Nintendo's platform before the end of Take-Two's fiscal year (Private Division's parent company).</p>
      <p>Take-Two's latest update to investors has now revealed The Outer Worlds will launch on the Switch "some time" within the first three months of 2020. So that's before the end of March, as originally suggested.</p>
      <p>Our colleagues over at Push Square gave The Outer Worlds <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/outer_worlds">nine out of ten stars</a> and said it was a "role-playing triumph" thanks to its brilliantly crafted sci-fi adventure, witty writing, great characters, solid combat and rewarding exploration.</p>
