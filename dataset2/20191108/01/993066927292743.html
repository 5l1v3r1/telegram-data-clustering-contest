      <p>DUP MEP Diane Dodds has been tipped to replace David Simpson as her party's election candidate in Upper Bann.</p>
      <p>The party's Upper Bann Association met last night to discuss a replacement for Mr Simpson.</p>
      <p>A DUP spokesman said the party would make an announcement on its new candidate "in due course".</p>
      <p>Mr Simpson <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/generalelection/2019/11/06/news/dup-mp-david-simpson-will-not-defend-upper-bann-seat-1758232/">announced on Wednesday he will not seek re-election</a> following an affair with a party colleague.</p>
      <p>The 60-year-old had held the Upper Bann seat since he deposed former Ulster Unionist leader and first minister David Trimble in 2005.</p>

      <p>Ms Dodds, who was re-elected as an MEP in May, will lose her job when the UK is scheduled to leave the European Union on January 31.</p>

      <p>She lives in the constituency and, if elected, would join her husband, DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds, at Westminster.</p>
      <p>Sitting Upper Bann MLAs Carla Lockhart and Jonathan Buckley are also in the frame.</p>
      <p>Ms Lockhart topped the poll in the 2016 assembly election, ahead of Mr Buckley and Sinn Féin's John O'Dowd who is also seeking election next month.</p>
      <p>Mr Simpson announced he would not seek re-election, saying his family had given him a "second chance" following reports of an extra-martial affair with Louise Templeton, his former parliamentary assistant and an ex-DUP councillor.</p>
      <p>"In recent times it has been well publicised that I made a mistake that brought hurt to my wife and family as well as bringing heartache to another family," he said.</p>
      <p>"These were my mistakes and for them I am truly sorry.</p>
      <p>"I have learned from my failings and my wife and children have given me a precious second chance and together we intend to look to the future together."</p>
      <p>He said he looked forward to supporting the DUP "in other facets in the future".</p>
