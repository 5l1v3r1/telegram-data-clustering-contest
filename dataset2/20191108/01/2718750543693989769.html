      <h1>Dick Cheney Is Not a Fan of Christian Bale’s Portrayal of Him in <i>Vice</i></h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T01:44:09+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 01:44</time> by <a rel="author">Bethy Squires</a></address>
      <p>Sorry to Christian Bale. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/djkevlar/status/1192565023421263872">Yahoo! Entertainment</a>, Bale was given a roundabout critique of his performance in <i>Vice </i>from Keke Palmer’s favorite old white guy, and it wasn’t exactly glowing. Although Bale’s not sure if the VP ever saw the Adam McKay joint, he said that Cheney passed along a message to him. “It was strangely enough through my son’s school. One of the moms, she was at a party he was at. She said, ‘Oh, I’m going to be seeing Christian tomorrow. Do you have anything to say to him?’ And he said, ‘Tell him he’s a dick.’”</p>
      <p>Now, you and I might think that Dick was making a funny when he called Bale a dick. But that was not the case. “I thought, ‘Oh, at least he’s got a sense of humor,’” Bale said. “And she said, ‘No there was no humor to that whatsoever.’” It’s like they always say: You can either be the architect of a forever war, or you can be good at puns. You can’t be both. </p>
