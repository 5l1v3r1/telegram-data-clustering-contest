      <p>On Thursday’s “CNN Right Now,” Representative Gerry Connolly (D-VA) stated that Democrats “threaten” private health insurance “at their own peril.” Connolly also stated that 2020 presidential candidate Senator Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) plan needs more detail.</p>
      <p>Connolly said, “I think if we’re going to have a nominee who supports Medicare for all, it’s going to have to be very carefully outlined. I think Medicare for all, a lot of it has been bumper sticker slogans, as opposed to real, careful details.”</p>
      <p>Connolly added that with Warren’s plan, “more details are necessary. There are a lot of experts who believe that she underestimated the cost. We need to explore that.”</p>
      <p>Host Dana Bash asked Connolly if he believes Warren underestimated the cost.</p>
      <p>Connolly responded, “I do. I think there are 160, 180 million Americans with private insurance and like it, and I think Democrats threaten that insurance at their own peril. We are on a winning streak. We’ve got to be very careful not to upset that.”</p>
