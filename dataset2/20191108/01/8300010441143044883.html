      <p>Some of the suspects were also arrested for violent crimes, including murder and attempted murder. Some also had prior felony arrests for murder.<br/><br/>Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer said his office runs the Gang Reduction Intervention Program at nearby Monte Vista elementary school to try to keep kids out of gangs like these.<br/><br/>"It's a really important program to try to educate and keep these kids who are growing up in this gang-infested community from joining gangs themselves as they become teenagers," Spitzer said.<br/><br/>An investigation is ongoing.</p>
