      <h1>Small Business Loan Fund on course to lend £9m to Northern Ireland firms</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T01:00:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 01:00</time> by <a rel="author">Ryan McAleer</a></address>
      <p>THE Small Business Loan Fund has reached the £2m mark, with 96 businesses across the north signing up in the past year.</p>
      <p>The fund provides loans of up to £100,000 to small businesses, while start-ups can obtain initial loans of up to £15,000.</p>
      <p>Managed by Ulster Community Finance (UCF) on behalf of Invest Northern Ireland, the fund is delivered in partnership with Enterprise Northern Ireland. UCF is a subsidiary of the social finance organisation Ulster Community Investment Trust (UCIT).</p>
      <p>Chief executive of UCIT, Harry McDaid said the fund has the potential to lend over £9m to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) over its five year lifespan.</p>
      <p>“Funding is available for requirements such as capital investment, working capital needs, new product and market development.</p>
      <p>“As well as creating a large number of new jobs, we've also helped safeguard existing roles. A wide variety of ambitious companies from a number of different sectors have benefited from the fund so far and their growth will continue to have a positive impact on the local economy.”</p>
      <p>Among the firms to use the fund is Magherafelt-based healthy meal firm Eat Naked NI.</p>
      <p>Caoimhe O'Kane said her company received a £15,000 loan to complete the fit out of a commercial kitchen in its new premises in Magherafelt.</p>
      <p>Set up four years ago, the company's healthy meal plan service has grown in popularity, requiring additional investment to support the expansion of the business.</p>
      <p>“Our new facility will support our growth moving forward and means our production capabilities will increase significantly,” she said.</p>
      <p>“We're looking to target large catering contracts and we'll be hiring further staff as the business grows.”</p>
      <p>Invest NI's corporate finance director, William McCulla said the £2m milestone signalled a significant demand for the loan fund.</p>
      <p>“The fund is an established part of the local SME funding ecosystem, assisting small businesses right across Northern Ireland and is available to all sectors, with flexible repayment terms.</p>
      <p>“It continues to address the funding challenges small businesses here face, including in the start-up phase.”</p>
