      <p>FORMER Ireland rugby player Trevor Ringland has ruled himself out of the election battle to succeed Lady Sylvia Hermon as MP for North Down.</p>
      <p>The solicitor had been tipped as a possible UUP candidate in the December 12 poll following independent unionist Lady Hermon's <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/generalelection/2019/11/06/news/lady-sylvia-hermon-will-not-stand-in-north-down-1758617/">decision not to seek re-election</a>.</p>
      <p>Her departure has left the Brexit-backing DUP as favourite to take the seat while pro-Remain voices scramble to pick up her sizeable vote share.</p>
      <p>Former UUP leader Mike Nesbitt, the party's North Down MLA Alan Chambers and incoming leader Steve Aiken are among those speculated to potentially be the UUP candidate.</p>

      <p>The party is expected to announce its decision early next week.</p>
      <p>Mr Ringland, who was involved in the One Small Step campaign towards peace-building, yesterday declined to say whether he had been asked by the Ulster Unionists to consider standing in the election.</p>
      <p>The 59-year-old said he hoped a candidate would emerge with similar credentials to those of Lady Hermon, and he would be willing to canvas for them if such a person emerged.</p>
      <p>Mr Ringland, who stood for election in East Belfast in 2010 as part of the UUP's pact with the Conservatives, said he was "not interested" in being the North Down candidate.</p>
      <p>"I am interested though in a candidate emerging that matches what Sylvia was about. Over the years she has been a constructive voice for unionism and hopefully a candidate will be found who can continue that," he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Ringland, who is pro-Remain, said "constructive unionism" which is "wanting Northern Ireland to work for everybody" needs to be represented.</p>
      <p>"I hope there is a candidate going into North Down who represents that view, and if there is I would certainly be out on the streets canvassing for them," he added.</p>
      <p>He said that when he heard Lady Hermon would not be seeking re-election, he thought about how he had intended to contact her some weeks ago.</p>
      <p>"I meant to ring her two or three weeks ago and try and talk her into staying for this election. I thought, 'I wish I had made that phone call,' because I think what we needed to do was think about somebody coming in to represent the same views that she expressed over the years," he said.</p>
      <p>Lady Hermon first won North Down in 2001 as an Ulster Unionist, but she left the party in 2010 over its electoral pact with the Conservatives.</p>
      <p>Like the 52 per cent majority in her constituency, she backed Remain in the 2016 EU referendum.</p>
      <p>In 2017 she was returned as the north's only pro-Remain MP to take their seat at Westminster but the DUP cut her majority to just 1,208.</p>
      <p>The UUP had stood aside in North Down in the last two Westminster elections but the party's incoming leader Steve Aiken had vowed to field a candidate this time.</p>
      <p>Before she announced her retirement, Sinn Féin and the SDLP had announced they would not run candidates in North Down to back Lady Hermon as a pro-Remain candidate.</p>
      <p>On Thursday night Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry was announced as his party's candidate.</p>
      <p>The Green Party is expected to make a decision on whether to stand in North Down by the weekend.</p>
