      <p>The question Sushma Swaraj read, “Which is the only union territory or state in India that had two women serve consecutively serve as chief ministers?” The options were Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Delhi and Rajasthan. The correct answer was Delhi which saw Sushma Swaraj and Sheila Dikshit serve as its chief ministers from the BJP and the Congress respectively.</p>
      <p>Bachchan said, “Sushma Swaraj was the chief minister of Delhi for a brief period in 1998.” The contestant from Madhya Pradesh said that <a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/india/former-foreign-minister-sushma-swaraj-has-passed-away/261856/">Sushma Swaraj</a> was her favourite politician. To which, Bachchan replied, “(She was ) Many people’s favourite. Favourite (politician) of all of us.”</p>
      <p>Bachchan also informed in a sombre tone that ‘unfortunately’ both these leaders passed away only this year. While <a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/india/former-delhi-chief-minister-sheila-dikshit-passes-away-aged-81/259024/">Dikshit died</a> in July this year, Swaraj passed away a month later.</p>
      <p>Thursday night’s show also saw Bachchan walk down memory lane after he was reminded that he 7 November was when he had made his Bollywood debut 50 years ago. The occasion became special as Oscar-winning sound engineer Resul Pookutty gifted him a special book to mark his 50 years in the Hindi film industry.</p>
      <p>The Bollywood megastar also recounted he had survived a near-fatal explosion in his Kolkata house, where he lived with his friends as a youth. When asked how he made his film debut, Bachchan informed that he had first failed to make the cut in a talent-hunt competition launched a film magazine. It was here when his father said that he needed to make his own path if acting was what fascinated him the most as a career.</p>
      <p>According to Bachchan, he travelled to Mumbai and began contacting film producers. One filmmaker, Khwaja Ahmad Abbas, looked at his surname ‘Bachchan’ contacted his poet father Harivansh Rai Bachchan to find out if he had run away from his parents’ house. ‘Abbas sahab,’ said Bachchan, decided to cast him for <i>Saath Hindustani </i>only after his father assured him that he had travelled to Bombay to become an actor.</p>
