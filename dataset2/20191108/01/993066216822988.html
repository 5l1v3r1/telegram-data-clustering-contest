      <p>THERE were mixed emotions for the Ulster squad yesterday as their inter-provincial success in London was marred by a serious injury to Armagh’s Ciaran McKeever.</p>
      <p>In Ruislip, it was feared that McKeever had broken his leg after leaving the field in an ambulance in the first half, but Orchard boss Paddy O’Rourke confirmed that the Cullyhanna half-back had suffered ankle ligament damage instead.</p>
      <p>“It’s not a fracture,” said O’Rourke. “It will take about 48 hours until we find out how serious it is, we’ll not know how long he will be out for until later this week.</p>
      <p>“Of course, there is just one thing on Ciaran’s mind and that is how quickly he can get back playing,” added the Armagh boss.</p>
      <p>While the injury certainly put a dampener on proceedings, Joe Kernan’s charges still had reason to celebrate after claiming a 29th Railway Cup title by seeing off Munster on a 0-15 to 1-8 scoreline.</p>
      <p>Ulster: J Devine; K Lacey, Justin McMahon, G O’Kane (0-2); A Kernan, C McKeever, R Flanagan; K Hughes (0-2), E McGinley (0-1); P Finlay (0-1), B Coulter, Joe McMahon; P Bradley (0-3 1f),S O’Neill (0-1), M Murphy (0-1f).</p>
