      <p>Police in Italy are protecting an 89-year-old Holocaust survivor after she received hundreds of death threats on social media.</p>
      <p>Liliana Segre is an Italian senator-for-life, a title bestowed by the Italian president to former heads of state or accomplished artists or scientists. Senators-for-life are given the full power and authority of an elected lawmaker, as well as some legal immunity.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of threats began targeting Segre online after she <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-50329597">called</a> on the Italian Parliament to create a committee to combat hate, according to the BBC. Segre's motion passed.</p>
      <p>"I appealed to the conscience of everyone and thought that a commission against hatred as a principle would be accepted by all," Segre said after the vote, noting that several abstentions by right-wing lawmakers made her feel "like a Martian."</p>
      <p>Italyâ€™s committee on security appointed two paramilitary carabinieri officers to begin protecting Segre after the vote and in light of the threats that began pouring in against her.</p>
