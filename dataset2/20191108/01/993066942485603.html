      <p>THE directors of Quinn Industrial Holdings (QIH) have refused an offer to meet members of the Quinn family.</p>
      <p>Sean Quinn jnr made the offer to meet with QIH executives in a statement to BBC Spotlight.</p>
      <p>It was issued for <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2019/11/06/news/-i-felt-i-was-going-to-die-kevin-lunney-tells-of-brutal-abduction-and-torture-1757694/">this week's broadcast of a powerful interview with Co Fermanagh businessman Kevin Lunney</a>.</p>
      <p>In September, the QIH executive and father-of-six was abducted, tortured and told to resign or die.</p>
      <p>The campaign of violence has been repeatedly condemned by politicians <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2019/10/28/news/sean-quinn-attacks-are-not-being-done-in-my-name-1748143/">as well as Mr Quinn</a>, the former owner of the QIH businesses and at one time a senior adviser to the company.</p>

      <p>Mr Quinn lost control of his business empire after a disastrous investment in Anglo Irish bank shares before the 2008 financial crash.</p>
      <p>When some of the businesses were brought back under local management in 2014, he also returned as a consultant but later left after a breakdown in relationships.</p>

      <p>He has insisted the attacks are not being carried out in his name and he is no longer interested in seeking ownership of his former businesses.</p>
      <p>In the statement Mr Quinn jnr said, while his family remained in a "commercial dispute" with the directors, it was willing to meet company representatives in a effort to "try and bring calm to the area".</p>
      <p>Responding to Mr Quinn's proposal however, QIH chief executive Liam McCaffrey said: "This is a peaceful community and played no part in Kevin's abduction and does not require calming.</p>
      <p>"What we need now are arrests and for an end to the provocative and baseless criticism of the business and its staff."</p>
      <p>He said if Mr Quinn had any information about the campaign of intimidation it should be passed to the authorities.</p>
      <p>In the Spotlight interview, Mr Lunney described the "excruciating" pain as his attackers broke his leg in two places, sliced his skin with a Stanley knife and doused him in bleach.</p>
      <p>Last week The Irish News reported <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2019/10/30/news/new-threat-against-qih-directors-by-gang-behind-torture-of-kevin-lunney-1751830/">how a masked gang had issued a new "last warning" threat to the directors</a> which was condemned on both sides of the border as "disgusting and unacceptable".</p>

      <p>Tánaiste Simon Coveney meanwhile <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/republicofirelandnews/2019/11/07/news/catching-kevin-lunney-s-attackers-a-top-government-priority-says-simon-coveney-1759620/">said catching the criminals behind the intimidation of QIH directors is a priority</a> for the Dublin government.</p>
      <p>Mr Coveney told the Dáil he was aware of concerns that investors in the company may pull out, with the loss of hundreds of jobs, if the campaign of violence in the Fermanagh/Cavan border area cannot be stopped.</p>
