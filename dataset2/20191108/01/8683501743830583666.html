      <p>While not the flashiest box office performer, 2014’s <i>Edge of Tomorrow</i> received a lot of positive reception, and two years later the sequel was announced. Doug Liman will be back to helm <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2452749/whats-happening-with-edge-of-tomorrow-2-according-to-doug-liman"><i>Edge of Tomorrow 2</i></a>, a.k.a. <i>Live Die Repeat and Repeat</i>, and recently revealed that the screenplay is finished, but at this point, he’s not entirely certain if the sequel will actually get made. When asked what the film’s chances are of becoming a reality, Liman responded:</p>
      <blockquote>I honestly have no idea. Between my schedule, Tom [Cruise]’s schedule, and Emily [Blunt]’s schedule, it’s tough. Certainly, it’s a world that I love, and like with <i>Impulse</i>, there’s a lot more story to be told.</blockquote>
      <p>While plugging his new YouTube series Impulse to <a href="https://collider.com/doug-liman-impulse-season-2-edge-of-tomorrow-2-chaos-walking-reshoots-interview/">Collider</a>, Doug Liman addressed the status of <i>Edge of Tomorrow 2</i>, noting that its two leads being so busy with other projects makes it difficult to get them back together for <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1709600/doug-liman-promises-edge-of-tomorrow-2-wont-just-be-another-sequel">another timey-wimey sci-fi adventure</a>. The script, which was <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2467717/looks-like-edge-of-tomorrow-2-is-finally-moving-forward">re-written by <i>The Invention of Lying</i>’s Matthew Robinson</a> earlier this year, is all done, but there’s still a long way to go before cameras start rolling.</p>
      <p>Even if Doug Lima felt he was too busy to direct <i>Edge of Tomorrow 2</i> and was willing to hand off helming duties to someone else, you can’t make this sequel without Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt, and those two are definitely not lacking for work. Blunt recently wrapped filming on <i>A Quiet Place 2</i> and is next expected to shoot <i>Not Fade Away</i>, and Cruise is gearing up to tackle <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481333/looks-like-christopher-mcquarrie-has-started-work-on-the-next-two--mission-impossible-movies">the next two <i>Mission: Impossible</i> movies</a>, which are filming back-to-back.</p>
      <p>So once <i>Mission: Impossible 8</i> has wrapped, that’s the earliest that <i>Edge of Tomorrow 2</i> could finally take the next step forward, and even then there could be other complications that could arise. Perhaps a point will eventually be reached where Doug Liman, Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt realize they just can’t make the pieces line up and abandon efforts to make <i>Edge of Tomorrow 2</i>. On the off chance that were to happen, fingers crossed this sequel could still be told in another way, like through a comic book series.</p>
      <p>While no specific plot details for <i>Edge of Tomorrow 2</i> have been revealed yet, Doug Liman has previously said that while it picks up where the first movie left off, it’ll also <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1705409/how-live-die-repeat-and-repeat-will-be-different-than-edge-of-tomorrow">involve traveling backwards in time</a>, thus serving as both a sequel and a prequel. Liman also once boldly claimed that <i>Edge of Tomorrow 2</i> is going to <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1578789/edge-of-tomorrow-2-will-revolutionize-sequels-according-to-doug-liman">“revolutionize how people make sequels.”</a></p>
      <p>Along with Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt reprising William Cage and Rita Vrataski, respectively, <i>Edge of Tomorrow 2</i> will introduce an important character who Doug Liman says is <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1665100/edge-of-tomorrow-2-is-going-to-add-a-major-character">“gonna for sure steal the show.”</a> Lima has also noted that William Cage isn’t really a full-blown hero by the time <i>Edge of Tomorrow</i> concludes, but he’ll have a “proper” and <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1690600/how-edge-of-tomorrow-2-will-evolve-tom-cruises-character">“way better arc” in the next story</a>.</p>
