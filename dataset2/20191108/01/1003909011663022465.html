      <h1>Alberta parent group launches letter writing campaign on education cuts</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T01:13:35+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 01:13</time> by <a rel="author">Eva Ferguson</a></address>
      <p>Over 1,200 Albertans have sent letters to their MLAs, blasting the UCP government’s 2019 budget and its impact on education funding.</p>
      <p>Support Our Students, a student-advocacy group that represents more than 2,000 parents provincewide, launched a letter-writing campaign this week which has already seen the direct delivery of about 1,200 letters across Alberta.</p>
      <p>“People are really upset,” said SOS spokesman Barb Silva. “They foolishly believed it when they heard that the UCP would maintain funding. But now they’re seeing massive cuts, much bigger than what anyone expected, and that will make a big impact.</p>
      <p>“For families, it means more fundraising, more fees, bigger class sizes and fewer resources.”</p>
      <p>SOS has created a form letter listing a number of points, including concerns around <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/school-districts-may-have-to-cut-hundreds-of-teaching-jobs-in-wake-of-provincial-budget">provincial funding that has been frozen at $8.2 billion from last year</a>, despite enrolment growing by 15,000 students across Alberta.</p>
      <p>“Every public school student in Alberta will have to be educated for less money,” the letter states.</p>
      <p>“This budget does not adequately account for more students in the system, increasing expenses related to teacher pay, transportation, school maintenance and other resources and supports.”</p>
      <p>The letter also says that private education in Alberta will see a $5-million increase in spending, going from $286 million last year to $291 million in 2019.</p>

      <p>“This clearly shows the government’s commitment to redirecting public taxpayer dollars to privately run institutions.”</p>
      <p>Sending a letter is easy, Silva explained, only requiring a name, email and postal code at this <a href="https://www.supportourstudents.ca/write-premier-kenney.html#/">link</a> and the letter is sent directly to a person’s MLA based on the postal code provided.</p>
      <p>“Any time an MLA receives even five letters on an issue, it’s important. So this works because MLAs have a personal stake in this. They need to get re-elected, and they need to react to constituents that are not happy.”</p>
      <p>Officials with the Calgary Board of Education estimate a funding shortfall of $32 million, which could result in <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/cbe-looking-at-hundreds-of-job-cuts-because-of-ucp-budget">the loss of as many as 320 positions</a>, including teachers, educational assistants and support staff.</p>
      <p>Principals are meeting with staff over the next few weeks, expecting to lay off teachers and shuffle students to other, larger classes, midway through the school year.</p>
      <p>The CBE says that up to $85 million in critical grants, including the all-important class size initiative grant to keep K-3 class sizes down, have been reduced to a transitional grant of $53 million. But the $32-million shortfall could balloon to as high as $48 million depending on how many teachers need to be paid out through to Christmas.</p>
      <p>While the UCP government presented a budget that froze provincewide funding, it is adamant it has increased support to programs that impact classrooms, like instructional services, while funding outside of classrooms, like transportation, has been cut.</p>

      <p>“Every student that crosses our doors is being funded,” Education Minister Adriana LaGrange has maintained.</p>
      <p>But education advocates have argued that a slight bump in one program does not make up for massive shortfalls in others, especially the class-size initiative grant.</p>
      <p>SOS also released a detailed report this week outlining the importance of the class size initiative grant, and why the UCP’s removal of it will have devastating impacts.</p>
      <p>The report analyzed how the grant has impacted funding and classrooms since 2004, crediting the program with hiring nearly 3,000 and concluding that without the grant, the proportion of K-3 students in a class size of 23 or more in 2018 would have jumped from 37 per cent to at least 87 per cent.</p>
      <p>In February 2018, the auditor general issued a scathing report about the class size initiative program, saying it had failed to keep class sizes down in spite of $2.7 billion in provincial funding since 2004, when the Alberta Learning Commission recommended K-3 class sizes remain at or below 17 students.</p>
      <p>But in response to the auditor general, school boards such as the CBE argued they used every penny of their grant funding to keep class sizes down, explaining that numbers have only crept up because the funding was still not enough.</p>
