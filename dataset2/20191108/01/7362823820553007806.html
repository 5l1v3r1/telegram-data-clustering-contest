      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/south-carolina">South Carolina</a> man says he went to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/fast-food">McDonald’s </a>for a sweet tea, and he got more than he asked for.</p>
      <p>Specifically, he got "high as a kite."</p>
      <p>The Island Packet <a href="https://www.islandpacket.com/news/local/crime/article237063389.html">reports</a> Parrish Brown went to a McDonald’s on Hilton Head Island and placed an order for10-piece chicken McNuggets, a double cheeseburger and sweet tea with light ice and extra lemon.</p>

      <p>Brown said he now believes that the fast-food restaurant workers thought “extra lemon” was a street name for marijuana.</p>
      <p>He said he found three bags of weed in his cup after drinking the beverage.</p>
      <p>“Well, I was high and panicking and at work, so I called my dad,” Brown told the news outlet. “I didn’t want to get in trouble for this.”</p>

      <p>Brown said he’d never had marijuana, so he didn’t recognize the taste.</p>
      <p>“I have never had weed a day in my life, so immediately after I started drinking it, I started to feel weird and it didn’t taste like something I recognized,” the 24-year-old Charleston man said.</p>

      <p>Beaufort County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Maj. Bob Bromage said an investigation is ongoing.</p>
      <p>McDonald’s told Fox News in a statement via email Thursday night: “Our biggest priority is always the safety and well-being of our customers. We are fully cooperating with law enforcement on the validity of this claim.”</p>
