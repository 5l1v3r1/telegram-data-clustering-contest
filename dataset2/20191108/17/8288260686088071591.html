      <h2>Latest Birmingham City news | Blues sent the young defender on loan to League Two side Macclesfield Town in a bid for him to gain first-team experience</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T17:00:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Wakefield</a></address>
      <p>Birmingham City sent a number of players out on loan at the start of the season in a bid for them to gain first-team experience.</p>
      <p>One of those said players is defender Corey O’Keefe, who is spending the campaign on loan with Macclesfield Town.</p>
      <p>O’Keefe has just one first-team appearance under his belt for <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Blues</a>, and has gone to Moss Rose for his second loan spell following a brief stint with non-league outfit Solihull Moors last season.</p>
      <p>So how has the <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Blues </a>defender been getting on so far during his loan spell?</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The 21-year-old made his debut for Macclesfield in their Carabao Cup first round tie against Blackpool in August.</p>
      <p>The Silkmen won the tie on penalties as O’Keefe played the first half but was substituted at the interval by then-manager Sol Campbell.</p>
      <p>He would get his first chance in a league game just a few days later after he came off the bench for the final 15 minutes of a 2-1 win away at Northampton Town.</p>

      <p>O’Keefe’s first league start would come just a week later as he played 83 minutes of Macclesfield’s 1-0 win over Scunthorpe, where he played on the right-hand side of a five-man midfield.</p>
      <p>The on-loan Blues defender has been utilised in a number of other positions while with the Silkmen, including left-midfield, right-back and defensive midfield.</p>
      <p>So far, O’Keefe has made 17 appearances during his loan spell at Macclesfield, and has proved to be capable of operating in a number of roles in the starting 11.</p>
