      <p>“We were really excited about the opportunity to work with [Hideo] Kojima because we have been fans of his work for a long time,” said Chvrches of the game’s creator <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/chvrches-bring-horizon-khalid-feature-death-stranding-timefall-soundtrack-2552682">when the track was revealed last month</a>.</p>
      <p>“He has always been such a visionary in the gaming world and we were honoured to be involved in the project. The concept of ‘Death Stranding’ is so unique and really felt to us like it was challenging people to care about the world they create — in the game and otherwise. We wrote this song specifically for ‘Death Stranding’, thinking of the themes of the game and what it is trying to say to people.”</p>
      <p>This comes after Chvrches admitted<a href="https://www.nme.com/festivals/opener/chvrches-talk-touring-and-tease-new-projects-at-opener-festival-2018-2350311"> to being huge fans of Kojima in 2018.</a></p>
      <p>“In fact, Hideo Kojima call me. We’re massive <i>Metal Gear Solid</i> fans and the guy’s a god. He’s an icon in the video games industry,” said Chvrches’ Martin Doherty.</p>
