      <h1>Airbnb Says it Will Pay for the Funerals of Victims in San Francisco Halloween Shooting</h1>

      <p>(ORINDA, Calif.) — Airbnb says it will pay funeral expenses for the five victims killed in a Halloween shooting at one of its rentals in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/Orinda-shooting-Airbnb-caves-to-criticism-and-14818638.php">The San Francisco Chronicle reports</a> the company said Thursday it will also cover counseling bills for their families.</p>
      <p>The decision comes after a victim’s lawyer, Jesse Danoff, blasted the company’s response to the Halloween massacre at one of its rental properties, saying Airbnb “responded in public with platitudes and thoughts and prayers.”</p>
      <p>Airbnb said in a statement it has set aside funds for funeral expenses and counseling for the victims’ families and has been in contact with Danoff.</p>
      <p>The Oct. 31 shooting sent some 100 terrified partygoers running for their lives. No arrests had been made.</p>
