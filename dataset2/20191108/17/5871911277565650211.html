      <h1>Shaq, Charles Barkley skewer Hassan Whiteside over lack of effort (Video)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T17:37:41+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 17:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thesportsdaily.com/author/tsd-staff/" target="_blank">TSD Staff</a></address>
      <p>The Miami Heat finally rid themselves of Hassan Whiteside once and for all, trading him to the Portland Trail Blazers over the offseason, and they’ve benefited big-time.</p>
      <p>Miami is off to a surprising 6-2 start, while Portland, on the other hand, has been struggling, at 3-5.</p>
      <p>And “Inside the NBA” analysts Shaq and Charles Barkley believe Whiteside is a major reason for the Blazers’ woes. They both went off on him during Thursday’s broadcast, talking about his lack of effort, and his performance on the court.</p>
      <p>Shaq got the ball rolling:</p>

      <p>Then Sir Charles weighed in as well:</p>

      <p>It didn’t take Whiteside long to fire back, either.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The two analysts raise a good point, as the proof is in the pudding. Just look at Whiteside’s play on the court over the years, and why the Heat were trying so hard to move him.</p>
