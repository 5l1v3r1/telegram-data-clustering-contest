      <p>SIMI VALLEY, Calif. (KABC) -- A man, woman and dog were found dead in an apparent murder-suicide inside a Simi Valley home after an investigation led to a <a href="https://abc7.com/simi-valley-neighborhood-evacuated-after-body-bomb-threat-found/5681674/">neighborhood evacuation over a bomb threat</a>.<br/><br/>Simi Valley police said Friday there was no search for a suspect, but an investigation is ongoing after the gruesome discovery Thursday night.<br/><br/>A SWAT team and bomb squad responded to the 500 block of Fairfield Road after a welfare check request around 7 p.m. Thursday. Firefighters found a woman's body inside covered in blood on the bottom floor of the split-level home. A man and a dog who both sustained gunshot wounds were found dead upstairs, according to police.<br/><br/>There was also writing on the wall that indicated a bomb was inside the home. However, police say there was no evidence of an explosive device at the scene.<br/><br/>"Pretty involved in terms of there is a lot of blood at the scene, but we don't have any further information beyond that," said Commander Steve Shorts with Simi Valley police.<br/><br/>The identities of the man and woman have not yet been released.<br/><br/>The surrounding neighborhood was evacuated for several hours, but evacuation orders were later lifted.<br/>The horrific incident sent shock waves through the normally quiet community.<br/><br/>"It's really scary, especially in this neighborhood," Jenna Clark said.
