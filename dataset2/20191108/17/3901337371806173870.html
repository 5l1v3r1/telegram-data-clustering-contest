      <p>Many eyebrows have been raised in the Spanish capital due to the situation around the 30-year-old in recent weeks, with his latest international call-up being the latest hot topic.</p>
      <p>Last month, Bale returned from duty with Wales injured, and is yet to return to action for his club, but will once again join up with his national side next week.</p>
      <p>Midfielder Toni Kroos has now admitted he finds Bale's situation strange, but insisted he believes Los Blancos still need to rely on the Welshman until the end of the season.</p>

      <p>"Yes, it seems inconvenient to return from your national team, not playing with your club and then be in the right condition again when you have to return to the national team," he told <i>Realtotal.de.</i></p>
      <p>"The moment may not be the best. I hope he will be fine again when he returns (from international duty).</p>
      <p>"I am convinced that we will still need his quality in many matches."</p>
      <p>Kroos was then asked about Bale's future at Real.</p>
      <p>"I do not know what will happen. He was about to leave in the summer," he answered.</p>
      <p>"After something like that, it is not so easy to get back to normal, but I get the impression that he is very motivated.</p>
      <p>"What will have bothered him most is to have returned from the national team."</p>
