      <h1>Pixel 4's Newfangled Astrophotography Mode is Rolling Out to Older Pixels</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T17:00:35+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author">Shabana Arif</a></address>
      <p>Google's newest smartphone has a nifty feature that lets it capture decent photos of the night sky, and it's coming to older devices.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.GoogleCamera&amp;hl=en_US">Google camera</a> update 7.2 is reliant on software, so it's possible to bring the too older handsets to up speed without much faff. We got a look at the mode <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/10/the-pixel-4s-astrophotography-mode-is-pure-witchcraft/">last month</a> and it seemed pretty impressive. Well now the whole family of phones can get in on the action, or at least those who own a Pixel 2, 3, 3XL, and 3a. It'll be rolling out in the next couple of days.</p>
      <p>The UI has been tweaked slightly, with a hidden overlay menu taking the place of  the bar at the top of the screen. Sharing images to social media just got a lot easier to, with the new Social Share feature that lets you upload your snaps to various platforms quicker than before.</p>
      <p>Burst photos have gone - holding the shutter button now will record a short clip, which is handy because I only ever use burst photo by accident. The rollout is staggered, by all accounts, so if it's not ready to download yet, sit tight.  [<a href="https://www.pocket-lint.com/phones/news/google/150022-google-camera-update-brings-pixel-4-s-astrophotography-mode-to-older-pixel-devices">Pocket-lint</a>]</p>
