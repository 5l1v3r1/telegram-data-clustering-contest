      <h3>What really happened</h3>
      <p><b>Head, Ultra High Net Worth</b>, <a href="https://www.ubs.com/global/en/ubs-news/r-news-display.html/en/2019/11/08/ubs-pwc-billionaires-report-2019.html">UBS Global Wealth Management</a>, Josef Stadler, stated,<i> “The billionaire boom of the past five years has now undergone a natural correction. The stronger dollar, combined with greater uncertainty in equity markets amidst a tough geopolitical environment, has created the conditions for this dip.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“Nevertheless, it’s clear that billionaire businesses continue to thrive. Billionaires are creating and steering businesses that consistently outperform equity markets. This business acumen has also translated into their philanthropy, as billionaires seek new ways to engineer far-reaching environmental and social change. This ‘Billionaire Effect’ is alive and well across the world – and shows little sign of slowing.”</i>
      </p>
      <h3>Billionaires’ initiatives</h3>
      <p>However, the billionaires across the globe came up with initiatives that drive a difference.</p>
      <h4>Highlights</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Self-made billionaires are seeking new ways to make the world a better place. Traditional grant-giving is evolving into strategic philanthropy and championing some ambitious causes.</li>
        <li>Philanthropists are also increasingly collaborating to make a difference, with other billionaires, NGOs, charities and governments.</li>
        <li>This Billionaire Effect can be attributed to billionaires’ appetite for smart risk-taking and their greater willingness to plan and invest for the long term.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Partner and Swiss Head Wealth Management</b>, PwC Switzerland, Marcel Tschanz, said, explained that the EU action plan for Sustainable Finance, UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have shown the world how individuals and institutions are expected to foster sustainability.</p>

      <p><b>According to him</b>, the public, however, is just catching up with our self-made entrepreneurs, who in the past years have transformed, innovated, and become more strategic in their ways of doing good.</p>

      </p>
      <p><b>Tschanz said</b>, <i>“Even if all the billionaires donated their total aggregated wealth of USD 8.5 trillion, they would not bridge the SDGs’ yearly funding gap, estimated at USD 7 trillion. Billionaires have taken up their responsibilities and a growing number of them are active in tackling world epidemic issues. It is up to all of us now to follow the leadership role billionaires have led, raise the power of technology and push for change.”</i></p>
