      <p>Gavin &amp; Stacey superstar <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/matthew-horne">Mathew Horne</a> has officially marked his romance with girlfriend Celina Bassili as they stepped out together for the first time.</p>
      <p>Mathew, 41, was spotted kissing the set designer, 25, back in July seemingly confirming he had split with fiancée actress Evelyn Hoskins, 31.</p>
      <p>He broke up with the Casualty star in December, just two months after popping the question.</p>
      <p>Fans had even thought they'd got married as he was sporting a ring when he appeared on This Morning before the breakup.</p>
      <p>Now Matt and Celina have attended their first public engagement together, cosying up for pictures to confirm they are a couple.</p>
