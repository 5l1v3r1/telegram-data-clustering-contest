      <p>PARIS - Authorities say a forearm discovered in the belly of a tiger shark off the French Indian Ocean island of Reunion is likely that of a Scottish tourist who disappeared while snorkeling.</p>
      <p>Richard Martyn Turner of Edinburgh vanished Saturday in a lagoon off the Reunion coast while snorkeling.</p>
      <p>Reunion Island Prosecutor Eric Tuffery told The Associated Press on Friday that a preliminary investigation shows the arm inside the 10-foot (3-metre) shark is Turner's. A wedding ring believed to be Turner's was found inside the shark.</p>
      <p>Authorities performed a necropsy on the shark Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Tuffery said authorities are using other tools including DNA research to confirm their initial findings.</p>
