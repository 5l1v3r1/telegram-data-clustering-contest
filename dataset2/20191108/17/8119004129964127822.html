      <p>As many as 14 ships were loading or unloading goods in Mongla, but the operations were halted after the warning signal was raised, the port’s Harbour Master Sheikh Fakhar Uddin said.</p>
      <p>There was no ship, but 12 tugboats, in Payra. The port was closed before the warning signal was raised.</p>
