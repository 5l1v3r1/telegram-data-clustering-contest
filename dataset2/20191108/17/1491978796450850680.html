      <h1>Hidden meaning in Jeremy Corbyn’s horseradish gift to Tom Watson?</h1>

      <p>Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett’s description of Brooke’s The Soldier as “snivelling ethnocentricity” (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/07/brexit-book-dead-poems">Brexit poetry offers pleasure and catharsis</a>, Journal, 7 November) showed a marked lack of empathy for the catharsis of others. During and after both world wars, many soldiers and their wives/widows, children/orphans have found solace in Brooke’s stirring words. One could debate the merits of patriotism, but this poem is not “snivelling ethnocentricity”.<br/><b>Mark Thompson</b><br/><i>Romford, Essex</i></p>
      <p>• Joel Golby says TI’s behaviour in having his daughter’s hymen checked annually “borders on abuse” (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2019/nov/07/sorry-james-dean-youre-better-off-dead-than-digitally-alive">G2, 8 November</a>). Under Working Together to Safeguard Children and Young People, every school and college in the land would refer that behaviour for what it is: abuse. Many abusers attempt to justify their actions – we should not pander to them.<br/><b>Liz Leek</b><br/><i>Barnsley College</i></p>
      <p>• “I hope the horseradish plants I gave you thrive,” Jeremy Corbyn wrote in his response to Tom Watson’s resignation letter (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/06/tom-watson-to-quit-as-labour-deputy-leader-and-stand-down-as-mp">Report</a>, 7 November). Horseradish is sharp, deep-rooted and impossible to get rid of. What a gift, what a metaphor!<br/><b>Elaine Yeo</b><br/><i>Enfield, London</i></p>
      <p>• How about adding a bleakness rating to your reviews? Peter Bradshaw gave Sorry We Missed You five stars (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/16/sorry-we-missed-you-review-ken-loach">Review</a>, 2 November) but it deserved five shovels for the depths of despair it evoked. After I, Daniel Blake, I should have known the latest Loach would be gruelling but it left me without any hope at all. What a world we live in.<br/><b>Wendy Dear</b><br/><i>Cottenham, Cambridgeshire</i></p>
      <p>• Before politicians talk of gold standards in education (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/nov/05/french-and-german-gcses-to-be-marked-less-harshly-ofqual-rules">Ofqual orders more lenient marking in GCSE French and German</a>, 6 November) they would do well to remember what the sterling gold standard did to the economy.<br/><b>Roy Boffy</b><br/><i>Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands</i></p>
      <p>• Further to the fracking moratorium correspondence (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/03/conservative-moratorium-on-fracking-is-just-an-election-ploy">Letters</a>, 4 November), I have just re-read an earlier article (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/22/uk-to-use-1bn-meant-for-green-energy-to-support-fracking-in-argentina">Britain to use £1bn green fund to support Argentina fracking</a>, 23 October). Says it all.<br/><b>Ruth Styles</b><br/><i>Frankton, Warwickshire</i></p>
