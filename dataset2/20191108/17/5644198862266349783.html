      <p>NAPIER: Dawid Malan smashed a 48-ball century and skipper Eoin Morgan made a blistering 91 to help secure a series-levelling 76-run victory in the fourth Twenty20 international against New Zealand on Friday.</p>
      <p>Malan and Morgan featured in a massive 182-run partnership to power England to 241-3, their highest total in this format, hitting 13 sixes between them.</p>

      <p>When the teams returned, spinner Matt Parkinson claimed 4-47 as New Zealand were all out for 165 in the 17th over, squaring the series at 2-2.</p>
      <p>Auckland hosts the fifth and final match on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Put into bat, England lost Jonny Bairstow in the fourth over while Tom Banton made 31 before becoming Mitchell Santner's second victim.</p>
      <p>Morgan walked out to join Malan and the left-handers lit up McLean Park.</p>
      <p>Malan became only the second Englishman to hit a century in a Twenty20 International when he smacked his sixth six, reaching the mark quicker than Alex Hales with his 60-ball hundred against Sri Lanka during the 2014 World Cup.</p>
      <p>Malan's unbeaten 103 off 51 balls also included nine boundaries.</p>
      <p>"Not very often you have days like that when every time you have a hack at one it lands safe or goes for six," Malan said after collecting the man-of-the-match award.</p>
      <p>"It's as good as it gets.</p>
      <p>"Felt like I had rhythm today, glad I clicked especially with these short boundaries."</p>
      <p>Morgan, at the other end, put up a six-hitting display of his own, clobbering seven of them as he threatened to eclipse Malan's hundred.</p>
      <p>The England captain, twice caught off waist-high full-tosses which were subsequently adjudged no-balls, eventually holed out after his 41-ball blitz.</p>
      <p>England, who were 88-2 at the halfway mark, plundered 153 runs from the final 10 overs.</p>
      <p>Martin Guptill (27) and Colin Munro (30) put on 54 runs for the opening stand before the wheels came off New Zealand's chase.</p>
      <p>Tom Curran dismissed Guptill and Parkinson (4-47) struck twice in the seventh over to rock the hosts.</p>
      <p>Tim Southee hit four sixes in his 39 but New Zealand did not get a significant partnership that could take them close to the target.</p>
