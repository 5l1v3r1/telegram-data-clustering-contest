      <p>Los Blancos were held to a 0-0 draw by Real Betis at the Santiago Bernabeu last weekend, in a game that did not have many highlights.</p>
      <p>Betis legend Joaquin, however, made headlines when he was spotted criticising Vinicius on the touchline after the Selecao teenager missed a chance to score for the home side.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old had carried the ball into the Betis box but was unable to find the finish, to which Joaquin, who was warming up on the sideline, reacted by saying "this is very bad", which was caught on camera.</p>

      <p>Now, a few days later, the 38-year-old has come out to publicly express his regret, admitting he wishes he had not said what he did.</p>
      <p>"It was a comment that came out when it shouldn't have," he explained to <i>Canal Sur Radio.</i></p>
      <p>"It's not that he's a bad player, because he wouldn't be at Real Madrid if he was.</p>
      <p>"I honestly felt so bad and I want to publicly apologise because he's 19 years of age, you know I'm not like that.</p>
      <p>"He's a phenomenon and has a bright future. I didn't say it with any other intentions."</p>

      <p>Vinicius, who has struggled for a place in Real's starting XI of late, has contributed to just two goals in 10 matches so far this season.</p>
