      <h1>Sorry, Kanye Hasn’t Forgotten About His Plans to Run — er, ‘Walk’ — for President</h1>

      <p>The 2020 presidential race <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/10/kanye-west-and-donald-trump-meeting-transcript.html">has its share of billionaires</a>, but can any of them <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/kanye-west-jesus-is-king-album-review.html">call themselves Christian <i>and</i> genius</a>? We’ll just have to wait till 2024 for a candidate worthy of both those titles: Kanye West, but it’s “Christian Genius Billionaire Kanye West” to you. At <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/08/kanye-west-running-president-2024-christian-genius-billionaire-name-change/">Thursday night’s</a> Fast Company Innovation Festival, the rapper doubled down on <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2016/11/where-2020-candidate-kanye-stands-on-the-issues.html">his 2024 presidential aspirations</a> — “No, what y’all laughing at?” he chided the audience — and added that he might change his name to spite <i>Forbes</i> for not calling him a billionaire. (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackomalleygreenburg/2019/06/14/kanye-west-net-worth-240-million-in-2019/#632fe3e75129">According to</a> the business magazine, he was worth $240 million in June of this year.) Dollar amounts aside, West also boasted about the amount of jobs he’ll create through Yeezy — enough that he’s “not gonna run, I’mma walk” for president. If it does happen, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/listen-kanye-west-new-album-jesus-is-king.html">we’ll expect him to join the race at a snail’s pace</a>.</p>
