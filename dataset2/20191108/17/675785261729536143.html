      <h1>Gordon Ramsay has sweary response as daughter Tilly goes public with new boyfriend</h1>
      <h2>Tilly Ramsay, 18, shared two sweet black and white photos with an unnamed boy as they visited South Africa</h2>

      <p>When Gordon Ramsay's your dad, getting his approval of your new boyfriend was never going to be easy.</p>
      <p>And Tilly Ramsay, 18, risked the wrath of the sweary chef, 53, when she went public with her new boyfriend on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> on Thursday.</p>
      <p>She shared two sweet black and white photos with an unnamed boy as they did some sightseeing in South Africa.</p>
      <p>In one photo they pose with their arms around each other, and in the next Tilly, a budding chef herself, looks giggly as she nestles in close.</p>
      <p>Her post shocked her famous dad, who wrote "WTF" in the Instagram comments.</p>

      <p>Tilly's brother Jack had anticipated their father's reaction, writing: "@gordongram interrogation time."</p>
      <p>Their sister Megan joined in, saying: "We have all been there Tills - gotta face up to it."</p>
      <p>One person commented asking if the boy was Tilly's boyfriend and she said "maybe".</p>

      <p>No wonder it comes as a surprise to Gordon, who just weeks ago revealed that Tilly is dating Gino D'Acampo's son Luciano.</p>
      <p>He said Tilly, who has her own CBBC show Matilda and the Ramsay Bunch, grew close to Gino's boy, 17, while their dads were filming new TV show Men Behaving Badly.</p>
      <p>Gordon shared news of his daughter romance's with the offspring of his pal Gino, 43, during an appearance on The Jonathan Ross Show.</p>

      <p>When he was asked about rumours the teenagers had grown close, famously foul-mouthed Gordon described the situation as a "f***ing nightmare".</p>
      <p>Gordon said: "We were driving through San Francisco and FaceTiming Luciano, and all of a sudden Tilly pops up behind them, and they are out having lunch.</p>
      <p>"I think they are friends."</p>
