      <h1>Chris Wallace: Impeachment investigation ‘an utterly polarized, utterly partisan exercise’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T17:42:11+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 17:42</time> by <a rel="author">Caitlin Yilek</a></address>
      <p>Fox News anchor Chris Wallace labeled the <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/house-approves-trump-impeachment-process-on-party-lines">impeachment investigation into President Trump</a> “an utterly polarized, utterly partisan exercise” because neither side is budging in their convictions.</p>
      <p>“Democrats obviously think it’s quite incriminating. Republicans think it isn’t. But that’s really the bottom line. It hasn’t changed anything,” he said Friday. “This is still an utterly polarized, utterly partisan exercise. No Republicans are jumping ship and joining the Democrats. No particular Democrats are jumping ship and joining the Republicans. These two camps are locked in place and it seems that nothing that is being presented is changing either side.”</p>
      <p>Wallace said it’s unlikely that any of the witnesses who are set to testify in public next week will change anyone’s mind because they’ve already testified to House committees behind closed doors and it’s improbable their stories will change.</p>
      <p>William Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, and George Kent, deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian Affairs, will be the first to <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/pelosi-public-impeachment-hearings-likely-in-november">testify in public on Trump’s conduct toward Ukraine</a>. Both are scheduled to answer questions Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/former-ukraine-ambassador-says-she-was-asked-to-tweet-trumps-praises-in-order-to-keep-her-job">Marie Yovanovitch</a> is testifying Friday.</p>
      <p>“We’ve read all their transcripts and one assumes that they’ll basically say in the open, on camera, what they said behind closed doors,” Wallace said.</p>
