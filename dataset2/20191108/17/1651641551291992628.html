      <p>Windows 10 IoT Core is for the smallest embedded systems like washing machine, automatic door lock, and of course, the Rasberry Pi, which is popularly known as the “The credit-card-sized computer.”</p>
      <p>But aside from Rasberry Pi, you might soon be able to run Windows Core IoT Core on your Calculator. A developer(known as <a href="https://twitter.com/imbushuo?s=17">@imbushuo</a> on Twitter) seems to have managed to successfully install Windows 10 IoT Core on an HP Prime Graphing Calculator.</p>

      <p>However, there is still a lot of work to be done as the project is not completed yet. That said, we still don’t know he managed to install Windows 10 IoT Core on the HP Prime Graphing Calculator. The developer is expected to share more details about the project in the coming days.</p>
