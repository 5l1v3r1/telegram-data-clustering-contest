      <p>Scientists at Oxford and Fudan University in China have developed a way to make fake rhino horns from horse hair. They hope these phony horns will be used to "confuse the trade," and make poaching less lucrative.</p>
      <p>From <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/education-50184280">BBC</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>The scientists say the "horn" of a rhino is not like the horn of a cow, but is formed from tufts of tightly packed hair that are glued together by secretions from the animal.<br/><br/>And the team of zoologists in Oxford and molecular scientists in Fudan University in Shanghai have developed a way of compressing and moulding horse hair in a way that looks and feels similar even when the "horn" is cut.<br/><br/>If credible fakes could be produced cheaply, the scientists say it would cut prices and reduce the incentive for killing the rhinos.<br/><br/>"It appears from our investigation that it is rather easy as well as cheap to make a bio-inspired horn-like material that mimics the rhino's extravagantly expensive tuft of nose hair," said Prof Fritz Vollrath, from the University of Oxford's Department of Zoology. <br/><br/>He said he hoped the technique could be used to "confuse the trade, depress prices and thus support rhino conservation".</blockquote>
