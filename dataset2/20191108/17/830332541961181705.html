      <h1>Slack continues to sink as analysts worry Microsoft will kill it</h1>
      <h2>Company puts 'heavy focus' on Teams product</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T17:06:51+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 17:06</time> by <a rel="author">Paul R. La Monica, CNN Business</a></address>
      <p>(CNN) - Slack may be ubiquitous in offices throughout Corporate America, but the company is facing a formidable challenge from a much larger rival. That has Wall Street analysts increasingly nervous about Slack's future.</p>
      <p>Microsoft, which is worth more than $1 trillion compared to Slack's market value of $10 billion, is hoping to unseat Slack with its Teams collaborative workplace app. Microsoft is offering a free version of the tool and is also bundling Teams into its Office 365 Business Premium and Office 365 E3 cloud-based subscription offerings.</p>
      <p>The Microsoft threat is a big reason why Slack's stock, which debuted in late June through a direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange, has plunged in the past few months. It's a classic David vs. Goliath story -- except that most investors don't believe Slack has a big enough rock to slay the giant from Redmond, Washington.</p>
      <p>Slack shares fell 2% Friday and dipped below $20, hitting an all-time low that is 25% below the stock's reference price of $24 on the day of its Wall Street debut. The stock has plummeted more than 50% from its peak of $42, which it reached on its first day of trading.</p>
      <p>The company <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2019/09/04/tech/slack-first-earnings-report/index.html">reported a big loss</a> and slowing sales growth in September, news that spooked investors.</p>
      <h3>Will Slack ever be profitable?</h3>
      <p>And while losses are expected to narrow, analysts are not forecasting a profit for slack next year. Or in 2021 or 2022, for that matter. Consensus estimates for 2023 are not yet available.</p>
      <p>Two analysts issued bearish reports on Slack this week, adding to the downward pressure on the stock. Both specifically mentioned Microsoft as the reason they were skittish.</p>
      <p>"We have observed strong fundamental progress of Microsoft Teams over the past 12 months," said Mizuho analyst Gregg Moskowitz in a report.</p>
      <p>He added that "there was a heavy focus on Teams" at Microsoft's Ignite conference for developers earlier this week, and noted that "customer interest levels in Microsoft Teams were very high."</p>
      <p>So even though Slack's stock has plunged in the past few months, Moskowitz said that he was lowering his target price to $20 from $24 because Slack's slide "has, if anything, increased our level of concern with respect to Microsoft Teams as a competitive threat."</p>
      <p>Dan Ives of Wedbush is even more worried about what's next for Slack.</p>
      <p>"The Slack solution is impressive and represents a strong growth opportunity, however we believe penetrating this next phase of enterprises will be incrementally more difficult as the Microsoft/Teams value proposition presents a major competitive hurdle going forward in sales cycles," Ives said in a report.</p>
      <h3>IP-No</h3>
      <p>Ives, who issued coverage on Slack with an "underperform" rating, added that "Slack will have significant difficulty further penetrating the enterprise given the significant competitive offering from Microsoft's TEAM product."</p>
      <p>He argued that the competition from Microsoft "could slow growth going forward quicker" than most analysts are expecting. He slapped a price target of just $14 a share on Slack, the lowest target of any Wall Street analyst.</p>
      <p>Slack's woes as a new public company mirror the challenges that many other so-called unicorns have faced.</p>
      <p>Ridesharing rivals Uber and Lyft and money-losing exercise bike company Peloton have plunged well below their offering prices due to doubts about their ability to earn a profit any time soon. Social media site Pinterest has also struggled as sales growth has slowed.</p>
      <p>WeWork <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2019/09/30/tech/wework-ipo-postponed/index.html">shelved its IPO plans</a> due to issues about its corporate governance and history of significant losses.</p>
      <p>Even Beyond Meat, which surged from its IPO price of $25 a share to nearly $240 in the first few months after its debut has since pulled back sharply, to $80, over concerns about growing competition from the likes of top rival Impossible Foods and big public food companies Nestle and Kellogg.</p>
