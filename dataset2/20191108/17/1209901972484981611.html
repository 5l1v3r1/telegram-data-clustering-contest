      <p>For Stettler’s RCMP Sgt. Philip Penny, one of the biggest drawing cards of Stettler is that ‘small town’ feeling.</p>
      <p>“I appreciate the ‘small town’ atmosphere that I think we often take for granted,” said Penny. “That ‘feeling’ isn’t something inherent to the size, demographic, location or infrastructure of a community, rather it’s something takes time to nurture and develop causing an atmosphere of inclusion, safety and a general sense that those around you are part of the larger picture of improving Stettler,” he noted.</p>
      <p>Penny explained that he has lived in several small towns over the years and Stettler, by far, provides the most in what many people are searching for in smaller communities.</p>
      <p>“Somehow, Stettler is able to balance that feeling while accommodating the surrounding communities by offering ‘big centre’ amenities such as shopping, restaurants, gas stations, etc. This balance is achieved by the community members and their desire to promote those things that make Stettler a great place to live.”</p>
      <p>As an RCMP Sergeant, Penny said he also appreciated the efforts that the community puts forth to combat crime and criminality.</p>
      <p>“We often encourage the public to change habits (lock car doors, take personal belongings from vehicles, lock house doors etc.), report crimes in a timely manner with a greater degree of information and to help the police in efforts to tackle a variety of issues that may be indirectly related to crimes,” he explained.</p>
      <p>”The community is receptive to these things and takes an active role in ensuring the community as a whole is part of the solution rather than relying on the limited resources of the police to tackle each issue alone,” he said.</p>
      <p>”Stettler’s Town and County residents recognize that solutions do not conform to the immediacy that other aspects of our society provide.</p>
      <p>I often use the example of ordering things online and receiving them within days or having no question unanswered thanks to the Internet and the ability to watch nearly any show/movie whenever we want thanks to streaming services,” he explained.</p>
      <p>“Crime is a reality that will likely always exist, but when police and community work together, longer lasting solutions can be initiated.”</p>
