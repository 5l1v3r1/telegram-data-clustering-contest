      <p>Dublin - <b>William Porterfield</b> has stepped down as <b>Ireland</b> captain after 11 years at the helm, Cricket Ireland announced on Friday.</p>
      <p>The 35-year-old, who took over from Trent Johnston in 2008, has been replaced by <b>Andrew Balbirnie</b>.</p>
      <p>"It has been an incredible journey, and a fantastic honour to have captained my country over the past 11 and a half years," Porterfield said in a statement on the federation website.</p>
      <p>"I feel, and in consultation with Cricket Ireland, that now is the right time to hand over that mantle."</p>
      <p>Porterfield, who intends to keep playing international cricket, led the senior Irish side 253 times across all forms of the game since taking over from Johnston.</p>
      <p>He led Ireland in two 50-over World Cups and five T20 World Cups, but perhaps his most significant moment as captain was leading Ireland out at its historic first-ever Test against Pakistan in Malahide in May 2018.</p>
      <p>"There have been many highs, along with a few lows along the way, but I can honestly say that it has been thoroughly enjoyable," he said.</p>
      <p>Leinster batsman Balbirnie, who will take over the Test and ODI teams, played his first one-day international against Scotland in 2010.</p>
      <p>He played in Ireland's first Test against Pakistan but the 28-year-old failed to score a run in either innings, becoming the 44th player in the history of Test cricket to be dismissed for a pair on debut.</p>
      <p>"The selectors have made a great choice in appointing 'Balbo'," said Porterfield.</p>
      <p>"Having spoken to him, I know how honoured and excited he is to get going.</p>
      <p>"I'm looking forward to helping and supporting Balbo in any way I can, and seeing him lead Ireland forward."</p>
