      <p>(CNN) - A 59-year-old Austrian tourist has been killed by an elephant while on a camping trip in Namibia, the southern African country's Ministry of Environment and Tourism said Friday.</p>
      <p>The man, who has not been publicly identified, was among a group of tourists staying at an undesignated camping site on the Huab river in the Kunene region of northwestern Namibia, the ministry said in a statement on its <a href="https://www.facebook.com/metnamibia/posts/2419775204904946">Facebook page</a>.</p>
      <p>"This is a very unfortunate incident and highly regrettable," the statement said. "We wish to express our sincere condolences to the bereaved family and friends of the deceased."</p>
      <p>No further details were provided about how the man died.</p>
      <p>The ministry and police were investigating and hoped to establish whether the tour group had a guide, the statement said.</p>
      <p>Initially, Namibia's tourism ministry reported that an Australian tourist had been killed. Officials later told CNN they determined that the person was Austrian.</p>
      <p>Namibia is home to more than 20,000 elephants, according to <a href="http://www.met.gov.na/files/downloads/e88_Desert%20elephant%20%20press%20release.pdf">the tourism ministry</a>.</p>
      <p>Visitors to the country are warned to "be cautious and adhere to the rules and regulations put in place for their safety."</p>
