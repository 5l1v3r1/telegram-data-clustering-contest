      <p>Stress Level Zero just announced a December 10, 2019 release date for <i>Boneworks </i>on Steam, and it's the kind of game that can sell itself <a href="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/823500/extras/Crowbar-1-steamsized.jpg?t=1573236221">with a single gif</a>. (Okay, actually, <a href="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/823500/extras/Crowbar-2-steamsized.jpg?t=1573236221">let's make that two</a>.)</p>
      <p>It's the kind of game that comes with a "Hey, you should probably have prior VR experience" warning.</p>
      <p>It's the kind of game you just want to explore, unwrap, and <i>exist in</i>.</p>

      <p>I don't know if <i>Boneworks </i>will live up to expectations – people have been drawing parallels to <i>Half-Life 2</i>, which is no small feat – but I'm convinced it'll be an unforgettable physics-driven experience. Assuming, of course, you have a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-valve-index-556196.phtml">Valve Index</a> (or a technophile friend to mooch off of). The game is also coming to Vive and Oculus Rift, but it makes the strongest case with Valve's <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-valve-index-556196.phtml">Knuckle controllers</a>.</p>
      <p>I feel like we're peering into the eventual promise of VR gaming here: worlds that give you near-total control of your surroundings and encourage you to think outside the box every step of the way.</p>
      <p>The actual hand-to-hand combat and shooting mechanics in <i>Boneworks </i>are fine and all, but more than anything else, I want to stack a bunch of shit and climb around. That's enough on its own.</p>
