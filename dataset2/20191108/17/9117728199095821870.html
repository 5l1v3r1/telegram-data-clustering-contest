        <b>Esteban Ocon may have missed out on a drive at <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mercedes-amg-f1-team">Mercedes</a> in 2020, but the Frenchman is still insisting his dream is to be a Formula 1 World Champion, as he prepares for life at <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/red-bull-racing">Renault</a>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ocon was confirmed to replace <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/nico-hulkenberg">Nico Hulkenberg</a> at Renault earlier this year, giving the French team their native driver. He'll partner <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/daniel-ricciardo">Daniel Ricciardo</a> in 2020 but it looks as if he'll have to settle for a place in the midfield in his first season back.</p>
      <p>Ocon has been phased out of the Mercedes team ahead of his Renault move but the former Force India driver has insisted he's still learnt a lot this season.</p>
      <p><i>"I have learned a lot from Mercedes this season,"</i> Ocon told Sky Italia.</p>

        <i>"I have seen a completely different side of the story from what you normally see as a driver. The experiences I have gained this year will definitely come in handy during the rest of my career. Me For example, I learned a lot this year from the other team members and the way they experience a race weekend."</i>
      </p>
      <p>Ocon still maintains his aim is to win a World Championship, he added: <i>"My goal is still to become a world champion in Formula 1. Otherwise, I would better stay at home. I am a driver and so I dream of the highest achievable. That is to achieve the world title."</i></p>
