      <h1>Meghan McCain says Tom Steyer is 'un-American and disgusting' for trying to 'buy voters'</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/the-view">"View"</a> co-host <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/meghan-mccain">Meghan McCain</a> had some strong words for billionaire and 2020 candidate <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/tom-steyer">Tom Steyer,</a> accusing him of betraying American values by trying to buy support.</p>
      <p>"You can't buy voters. Tom Steyer is actively trying to do that right now ... I think that is un-American and disgusting," McCain said on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/the-view">"The View"</a> Friday.</p>
      <p>"And I do not think you should be buying voters in the United States of America and the idea that you can just come in because you're a billionaire at this late stage in the game -- I am not for," she added.</p>
      <p>The co-hosts were discussing billionaire <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/michael-bloomberg">Michael Bloomberg's</a> <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bloomberg-move-panic-over-2020-field">potential run</a> for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020. Bloomberg previously served as New York City's mayor and is expected to file paperwork as a candidate for Alabama's Democratic primary.</p>

      <p>McCain suggested that Bloomberg, like Steyer, wouldn't be able to succeed by buying votes. She pointed to his Facebook spending, an apparent reference to the nearly <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pa7yjy/tom-steyers-facebook-money-bomb-worked-the-billionaire-is-about-to-qualify-for-the-democratic-debates">$2.9 million he spent on ads.</a> "</p>

      <p>On Thursday, Steyer also caught flak over a report that one of his top aides tried to buy endorsements by offering contributions to local politicians' campaigns.</p>
      <p>During Friday's show, co-host Joy Behar defended Bloomberg's record as a mayor and businessman.</p>
      <p>"He's a lovely guy. He's really smart. He cares about the country. He knows what he's talking about. I believe that the country needs a new manager -- he left a $2 billion surplus to this one who's there now," she said, referring to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/bill-de-blasio">Mayor Bill de Blasio.</a></p>
