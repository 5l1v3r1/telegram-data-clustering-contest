      <p>A shoving match broke out on the court following an International Tennis Federation match between Canadian player Katherine Sebov and American Alycia Parks on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Sebov won the match, which took place in Las Vegas, 6-0, 7-6 (9).</p>

      <p>But things got physical between the two players after Parks claimed that Sebov squeezed her hand too tight during the post-match handshake. As Sebov started to walk away, Parks is seen continuing to follow her down the sideline.</p>
      <p>The chair umpire tried to stop things from escalating further but the two competitors started to push each other. The umpire and the line judge eventually got things under control.</p>
      <p>A man, identified as Parks’ father, jumped the fence to get onto the court to keep things calm.</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/08/katherine-sebov-alycia-parks-pro-female-tennis-players-fight-court-aggressive-handshake/">TMZ Sports</a>, Parks told reporters that Sebov “squeezed my hand very hard.”</p>
      <p>Sachia Vickery, another player in the tournament, backed up Parks’ claim.</p>
      <p>“I was there she def squeezed her hand at the net. I hope they don’t try to spin this,” Vickery said in a tweet. “The ref clearly says he saw it. Won’t be shocked if nothing is done about it tho.”</p>
