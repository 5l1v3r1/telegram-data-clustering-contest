      <p>ColorWare, a company that designs custom-painted Apple products, today began offering <a href="https://www.colorware.com/p-1138-airpods-pro.aspx?c=ia4-8uhzm*ia6-8ukcm*ia8-8ukko">custom-painted versions of the AirPods Pro</a>, a little over a week after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/10/28/apple-airpods-pro-october-30/">first debuted</a>. <br/><br/>ColorWare is offering the ‌AirPods Pro‌ in dozens of custom colors, ranging from solids to metallics in all colors of the rainbow. Jet black gloss, deep purple, yellow, orange, red, gold, silver, and more are options.</p>

      <p>Each AirPod Pro earbud can be painted in a different shade, and the Wireless Charging Case can also be painted in a unique color. Users can choose between a matte or gloss finish.</p>

      <p>A custom version of the ‌AirPods Pro‌ will cost $389, which is a $139 premium over the base $250 price tag. Customizing the ‌AirPods Pro‌ case as well costs an additional $50, for a total of $439.</p>

      <p>ColorWare is using Apple's base ‌AirPods Pro‌ for the customization, so these have all of the standard features of the ‌AirPods Pro‌ such as Active Noise Cancellation, Adaptive EQ, and more, with no change in functionality due to the painting.</p>

      <p>To create ‌AirPods Pro‌ in custom colors, ColorWare disassembles them and then carefully custom paints each individual component. There is, unfortunately, no option for sending in existing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/">AirPods</a>.</p>
