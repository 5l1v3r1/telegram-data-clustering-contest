      <p>A former police officer and an <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/ayrshire/former-prison-guard-quizzed-17-20839327">ex-prison guard</a> who had sex with a schoolgirl have been cleared of raping her.</p>
      <p>Lee McMullan, 33, and Darren Hunter, 30, were found not guilty following a trial at the High Court in Glasgow.</p>
      <p>The pair had met the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/ayrshire/former-police-officer-tells-trial-20825271">17 year-old stranger</a> in the street after a drink and cocaine fuelled night out in Prestwick, Ayrshire days before Christmas 2017.</p>
      <p>They said the girl agreed to go to a hotel with them then later back to McMullan's flat in Glasgow's Gallowgate.</p>
      <p>McMullan said he had initially had sex with the teenager before his friend asked could he “join in”.</p>
      <p>The pair insisted they had each took part in “threesomes” before.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>They claimed texts after the incident was just “lads banter”.</p>
      <p>The pair denied rape insisting what happened was consensual.</p>
      <p>The girl – now 19 – had told jurors she had no memory of having sex with anyone.</p>
      <p>McMullan – who was a serving officer at the time – and Hunter sobbed after the verdicts were delivered.</p>
      <p>There were loud cries of “yes” from supporters in courts.</p>
      <p>The duo had been on a Christmas night-out in Prestwick. McMullan had booked them to stay at a hotel in nearby Ayr.</p>
      <p>Jurors were told they had brought two grammes of cocaine with them.</p>
      <p>The court was shown a photo taken in the hotel of a bible with a Rolex watch and a bag of white powder on top.</p>
      <p>McMullan sent the picture to a friend stating: “Lord, it has been a year since my last confession...”</p>
      <p>He then texted the same man again adding: “Staying overnight. Got sniff, plenty of booze. Just need a few birds.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>McMullan and Hunter left a club before trying to find a takeaway in the early hours.</p>
      <p>It was there they met the girl. She had earlier been out in Ayr with a friend.</p>
      <p>She told jurors her next memory was being in a hotel room with two strangers.</p>
      <p>The teenager said she was “too intoxicated” and did not even know what town she was in.</p>
      <p>The girl stated she then recalled waking up naked, this time in a flat.</p>
      <p>She added the same two men were there drinking lager and watching TV.</p>
      <p>The girl got her clothes – but said she had no idea why she had been naked.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Lisa Gillespie asked her: “How were you feeling?”</p>
      <p>The witness: “Confused. I asked where I was and they said 'Dennistoun'. I was worried what my mum may think.”</p>
      <p>She said one of the men left the flat with her. He asked did she remember what happened the previous night adding: “We had sex.”</p>
      <p>Miss Gillespie: “Any memory of anyone having sex with you?”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The teenager: “No.”</p>
      <p>She said on telling the man she was 17, he “turned around and walked away”.</p>
      <p>McMullan and Hunter both claimed the girl had agreed to go with them to the hotel and then back to Glasgow.</p>
      <p>They wrongly believed she was in her 20s.</p>
      <p>McMullan told jurors he had consensual sex with the schoolgirl before. </p>
      <p>Hunter came into the bedroom.</p>
      <p>McMullan insisted the schoolgirl “enjoyed” what happened.</p>
      <p>Hunter, of Baillieston, near Glasgow, accepted it was “not the most romantic encounter”.</p>
      <p>The trial heard how the pair exchanged texts after the incident.</p>
      <p>This included “beast”, “rapey” and “delete all evidence”.</p>
      <p>One friend also messaged McMullan that he did not want to be visiting him in Addiewell prison.</p>
      <p>McMullan told the court: “I am not saying I raped her as I did not.”</p>
