      <h1>Billiat: I Will Never Be Happy</h1>

      <p>Khama Billiat, the Kaizer Chiefs talisman, says he does not want to draw too much attention to himself by setting personal targets. </p>
      <p>The Zimbabwean attacker, though his contribution in his club jersey is often very evident, has only managed one goal in nine appearances – and much will be expected from him when Chiefs host rivals Orlando Pirates in an Absa Premiership Soweto Derby tomorrow afternoon. </p>

      </p>
      <p>In his maiden season at Chiefs, Billiat scored nine goals and got 10 assists in 35 games – still a far cry from his 12 goals and 14 assists in 26 league appearances for Mamelodi Sundowns three years ago.</p>
      <p>“I will never be happy, I always want to contribute as much as I can. But I am more happy when the team is doing well and everyone is scoring goals from different angles. It gives us more depth. I don’t think it would be fair to be selfish and look at myself and how I am doing. I think the team is doing well overall. It’s not about me,” Billiat said. </p>
      <p>He also revealed that it took a while before coach Ernst Middendorp’s footprint could be drilled into the players shortly after his arrival. </p>
      <p>“We are understanding the coach’s philosophy better now and getting into it, though it took us a bit of time. We are a unit. And when you are in a good space, things just flow. When the coach arrived we never really knew our roles in certain moments. But now we understand him better and the things we thought were difficult for us, it is becoming so easy through hard work and paying attention to detail.”</p>
