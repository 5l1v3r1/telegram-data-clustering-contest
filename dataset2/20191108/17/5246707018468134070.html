      <p><b>Original Article (Fri 1st Nov, 2019 10:30 GMT):</b> The <b>Pokémon</b> series has been home to numerous musical masterpieces over the years - who can forget the tracks that play as you whoosh down the Cycling Road or as you challenge the Elite Four - and the upcoming <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_sword_and_shield"><b>Pokémon Sword and Shield</b></a> are sure to follow that trend in style. This time around, it turns out that the core team has had some assistance from none other than Toby Fox.</p>
      <p>Best known as the creator of super-popular RPG <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/undertale"><b>Undertale</b></a>, Fox is not only a game developer, but also a talented musician. He actually composed all of the music for Undertale, and more recently shared his skills on Game Freak's <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/little_town_hero"><b>Little Town Hero</b></a> soundtrack. Clearly, Game Freak was happy enough with his work to sign him up for this major release.</p>

      <p>Fox notes that he was asked to compose a track for the upcoming games, describing it as a "huge honour". He goes on to say, "By the way, it's not like a main track or anything. I just thought it was cool".</p>
      <p>Here's a piece composed by Fox for Undertale:</p>
