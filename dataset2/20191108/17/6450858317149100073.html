      <p>Many of us are proud to have ancestors who served in the Armed Forces, but that doesn’t always mean we know the details about where they were stationed, in which battles they fought, or which decorations they were awarded. If you agree that their memory should live on, researching more about who they were is critical.</p>
      <p>FindMyPast’s military records cover all three service branches of the British Armed Forces, plus those in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Ireland, documenting everything from service records to military pensions, medal rolls, casualty lists, regimental histories and more.</p>
      <p>In addition to this its civilian records include censuses, births, marriages, deaths and wills, plus education, employment, travel and social history records.</p>
      <p>If you get a taste for researching your family history, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3777582-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Finternet%2Ffindmypast-3777582%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.findmypast.co.uk%2F">FindMyPast</a> offers two ways to buy access to its records: through PayAsYouGo credits, or through a billed subscription plan.</p>
