      <p>SINGAPORE: A 47-year-old grandmother was among 94 people arrested this week for suspected drug offences in an islandwide operation conducted by the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB).</p>
      <p>The woman, a suspected drug trafficker, had a baby and two other young children with her at the time of arrest on Monday (Nov 4), the police said.</p>

      <p>She was babysitting a one-year-old girl, who was subsequently handed over to her mother, CNB said.</p>
      <p>The other two children - a five-year-old girl and a six-year-old boy - are the suspect’s grandchildren.</p>
      <p>They have since been referred to the Ministry of Social and Family Development’s Child Protective Service after authorities failed to contact their mother.</p>
      <p>Two packets of Ice were recovered during the arrest near Jurong West Street 91.</p>
      <p>
        <b>ARRESTS IN MULTIPLE LOCATIONS</b>
      </p>
      <p>Separately, 93 other people were arrested in separate raids across areas such as Ang Mo Kio, Bukit Batok, Bukit Panjang and Pasir Ris this week.</p>
      <p>In all, officers seized 314g of Ice, 81g of cannabis, 18g of heroin, 384g of ketamine, 498 Ecstasy tablets, 652 Erimin-5 tablets and 40g of new psychoactive substances during the operation.</p>
      <p>In one case, two suspected traffickers were arrested around Jalan Rengkam in Hougang on the evening of Nov 6.</p>
      <p>CNB said its officers saw a 38-year-old man - who was accompanied by a 39-year-old man - get into a black car and re-emerge with a blue plastic bag.</p>
      <p>Shortly after, the black car left, and a team of officers tailed it.</p>
      <p>The two men headed to another car parked around Hougang Street 31. They were arrested just as they got into the car, where a blue plastic bag containing about 119g of Ice was found.</p>

      <p>The black car was later intercepted at the junction of Pasir Ris Drive 1 and Loyang Avenue. Two men, aged 27 and 29, were arrested. About 5g of Ice, 10 Ecstasy tablets and S$7,585 in cash were found in the car.</p>
      <p>More drugs were found when officers raided the suspects’ flats, CNB said.</p>
      <p>Investigations are ongoing.</p>
