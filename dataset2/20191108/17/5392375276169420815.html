The update will also land on the latest smartphones of the subsidiary Honor, the Honor 20 and 20 Pro. These flagship devices are already getting the stable version.

      <p>The upgrade path is: open the mobile phone [Flour Club] App – [Forum] – [All Editions] – [EMUI Zone] – [Upgrade Early Adoption] sign up to participate.</p>
      <p>It is important to note that before upgrading to the beta version, please backup all your data. In addition, confirm that the backup content is complete and valid. Some old third-party applications are not compatible with Android 10 thus users should try to update to the latest version of EMUI before upgrading to the current beta version. Furthermore, users must ensure that the phone has more than 6GB of internal storage. Also, ensure that the phone has no ROOT.</p>
      <p>It should be noted that the public beta registration only supports the matching model in the mobile phone pollen club App registration.</p>
