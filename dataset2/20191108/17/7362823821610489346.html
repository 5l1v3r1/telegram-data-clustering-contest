      <h1>‘Dallas’ star Patrick Duffy says he still considers himself a ‘married man’ after his wife’s death</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/dallas-star-patrick-duffy-credits-man-from-atlantis-for-helping-him-nab-role-of-bobby-ewing">Patrick Duffy</a> says he still feels the presence of his beloved wife.</p>
      <p>Carlyn Rosser, who was married to the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/dallas-star-sheree-j-wilson-recalls-working-with-prankster-larry-hagman-shares-her-big-regret">“Dallas”</a> star for 43 years, died in 2017 at age 77, leaving behind Duffy and their two sons — 45-year-old Padraic and 39-year-old Conor.</p>
      <p>“I can hear her. I can see her,” the actor told <a href="https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/patrick-duffy-still-considers-himself-married-after-wifes-death/">Closer Weekly</a> for the magazine’s latest issue currently on newsstands. “I know what she would expect of me, and I try and live up to that.”</p>
      <p>“I feel close to her all the time, [but] what I miss most is her touch,” continued the 70-year-old. “I still consider myself a married man.”</p>

      <p>According to the outlet, Duffy instantly knew Rosser was "the one" when he first locked eyes with her.</p>
      <p>“I was an immature college graduate touring as a narrator with this dance production, and she was a beautiful ballerina 10 years older,” he recalled. “We met on the tour bus and that was it — for life.”</p>
      <p>Duffy said Rosser’s death came unexpectedly, making her loss all the more painful.</p>

      <p>“It was a surprise when she passed,” said Duffy. “There was no indication. So that was the big adjustment. My boys were there as stalwarts. But I also realized that, as much as they were trying to buttress old dad up, I’m probably more adjusted to this set of circumstances than they are. You reach a certain age and you realize the road ahead is much shorter than the road behind.”</p>
      <p>Duffy is aware he must move forward, both for himself and his family. However, he said he will continue to cherish the memories he has of Rosser.</p>

      <p>“There are no mistakes in life,” he said. “I can mend every fence I’ve broken and create value out of everything I’ve done if I’m given enough time. I have done it and I still am doing OK. I have worked hard to make the best of life, and it’s been good to me.”</p>
      <p>In October of this year, Duffy told <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/dallas-star-patrick-duffy-credits-man-from-atlantis-for-helping-him-nab-role-of-bobby-ewing">Closer Weekly</a> he credited one sci-fi drama for his success over the years.</p>

      <p>“If there wasn’t a ‘Man from Atlantis,’ I wouldn’t have been on ‘Dallas,’” Duffy told the outlet. “For starters, the producer of ‘Dallas,’ when he was creating the original show, [he] was filming a different one, right next door to me on ‘Man From Atlantis.’ He requested me to play the part of Bobby; I never auditioned for it.”</p>
      <p>“Had he not been there, next door to where I was doing ‘Atlantis,’ that opportunity may never have presented itself to me,” added Duffy. “So ‘Atlantis’ is very important in my career.”</p>
      <p>“Man from Atlantis” chronicled the adventures of an amphibious man [Duffy], who was the last survivor of the legendary sunken city. It aired on NBC for one season between 1977 and 1978.</p>

      <p>According to the outlet, the show was very similar to the 1961 Robert Heinlein novel “Stranger in a Strange Land,” which tells the story of Valentine Michael Smith, the sole survivor of a Mars colony who is brought to Earth. However, Duffy told the outlet that both stories were completely different.</p>
      <p>“’Man from Atlantis’ wasn’t an adaptation,” he stressed. “Basically, it’s a recurring theme throughout most science fiction. ‘Man from Atlantis’ was that and I loved the opportunity to examine things with virginal eyes. In other words, we get so used to saying, ‘This is a plastic cup’ or ‘This is a recording device,’ but if you were from Planet-X, you had no idea what that was. You have to learn everything and that’s what ‘Man from Atlantis' was.”</p>

      <p>“It was fun to play a superhero,” Duffy continued. “On top of that, obviously it was before almost all special effects, very little green screen, so everything we had to do was invented at the time. Now I look at the tentpole major features like <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/x-men-future-dark-phoenix-bomb">‘X-Men’</a> and all these other things and the special effects are phenomenal. Because we didn’t have that technology, if I was going to fly up somewhere, they had to hoist me up with a crane. It was fun.”</p>
      <p>Duffy also shared that the series also came at the right time for audiences.</p>

      <p>“There was the original George Reeves series ['Adventures of Superman'] where he was playing <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/former-superman-actor-dean-cain-sworn-in-as-reserve-police-officer">Superman</a>,” Duffy explained. “There was simultaneous to ‘Man from Atlantis’ on the air, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/six-million-dollar-man-star-lee-majors-says-he-was-hesitant-to-take-on-role">‘The Six Million Dollar Man.’</a> But we were one of the first to not just be a strong detective or policeman, but someone with actual superpowers and tried to make that on a weekly television show basis. It was obviously difficult, because we only lasted two years, but I think we were pioneers in that sense.</p>
      <p>“And there’s a clique of people who will never forget ‘Man from Atlantis.’ Usually, men come up to me and say, ‘I was 8 years old and tried to swim like you in the pool.’ So at an impressionable age, young people saw that show and never forgot it.”</p>
