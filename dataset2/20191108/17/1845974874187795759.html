      <h4>The 4-4 score line versus Ajax flattered Chelsea. With suspensions, injuries, and poor form, Frank Lampard will have to rebalance the 4-3-3 for Palace.</h4>
      <p>Before the two red cards handed Chelsea a lifeline, the Blues were losing 4-2. They still showed the characteristic Frank Lampard’s Chelsea fight back, but the game was pretty much dusted. Between that, injuries, suspension, and bad form, Lampard will need to step back and rebalance his 4-3-3/4-2-3-1 formation for Crystal Palace. The quality is there, but finding the right ratio for everything will be a touch tricky for the <a href="https://www.chelseafc.com/en/news/2019/11/08/frank-lampard-wins-manager-of-the-month-and-calls-it-good-marker"><b>October manager of the month</b></a>.</p>
      <h3>Kepa Arrizabalaga, 1, Goalkeeper, Spain</h3>
      <p>Arrizabalaga had a weird day against Ajax that will justify both sides of the argument about him. The open play goals left him stranded, as Chelsea’s defense has traditionally done to their keeper for the last two seasons. On the first own goal, he had the read of the ball before Tammy Abraham came barreling in but Arrizabalaga should have called for it. The second, off his face, had a wicked curve but he could have come out for it sooner. Hopefully Palace is a less strange match for him.</p>
      <h3>Reece James, 24, Right back, England</h3>
      <p>Lampard showed some ruthlessness when he pulled Marcos Alonso at half time. He also showed great trust in a young player by bringing James on. For the first time this season, James looked fully what he was hyped up to be. His injury issues and lack of polish were nowhere to be seen as he dominated his flank. He deserves to build on that performance with a start in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Kurt Zouma, 15, Center back, France</p>
      <p>On paper, Andreas Christensen has the highest ceiling of any Chelsea center back (though Fikayo Tomori may have something to say about that now). But despite being fit enough to play again, the partnership that Tomori and Zouma have developed in the absence of any other center back is hard to break up right now. Do not expect any major changes to the center back pairing in the short term. For now, it is Zouma and Tomori’s time to shine.</p>
      <p>Fikayo Tomori, 29, Center back, England</p>
      <p>Tomori started somewhat roughly against Ajax as he tends to do against any opponent before settling down. It did not help that Alonso had his worst performance of the season and Tomori was often roped into it by choice or by circumstance. Still, Tomori is undroppable right now and it is becoming increasingly hard for Gareth Southgate to not throw him right into the starting XI of the English squad. His rise just does not seem to have an end in sight right now.</p>
      <h3>Cesar Azpilicueta, 28, Left back, Spain</h3>
      <p>Emerson did not even make the bench against Ajax despite playing against Watford. He did not really stand out against the Hornets, but that is pretty standard for a player returning from an injury that long. Still, to not even make the bench in the next match implies he is not nearly as fit as believed. Azpilicueta did extremely well once moved to the left side against Ajax and even if Emerson is fit, Lampard may find it hard to justify dropping his captain.</p>
