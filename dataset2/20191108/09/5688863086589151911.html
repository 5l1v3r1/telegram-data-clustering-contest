        <b>The Premier League’s efforts to draw Erling Haaland to England may just have to wait with the 19-year-old keen on a move to RB Leipzig. The Norwegian striker has hit the big stage this season and his performances in the Champions League have certainly caught the eye of Europe’s biggest sides.</b>

      <p>Manchester United, <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/juventus">Juventus</a>, <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/real_madrid">Real Madrid</a>, Barcelona, <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/arsenal">Arsenal</a>, Liverpool, PSG, and even Inter Milan’s plans to sign Erling Haaland may have to be put on hold. The 19-year-old striker has been in exceptional form this season and has proved to be more than just a normal teenage football star for RB Salzburg. The Norwegian has already netted 23 goals in all competitions so far with seven goals in his first four Champions League appearances.</p>
      <p>That includes a hattrick on his debut but Sky Sports has reported that the 19-year-old is considering a move to <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/rb_leipzig">RB Leipzig</a> and stay affiliated to the RB group. Reports have indicated that Leipzig manager Julian Naglesmann has already sent out several scouts to watch Haaland and is a known admirer of the striker. The <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/tournament/bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> outfit are not the only ones with <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/bayern_munich">Bayern Munich</a> and <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/borussia_dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a> also having watched the 19-year-old play.</p>
      <p>But what has convinced the Norwegian striker, Sky Sports further reported, is the fact that Leipzig convinced both Haaland and his father that his development would be better served with a move to Germany. It’s the move that many before him have made including Naby Keita, Bernardo and a few others have made over the years with Timo Werner and Dayot Upamecano the latest former RB Salzburg men to be linked with a move from RB Leipzig.</p>
