      <h1>Toni Kroos slams Gareth Bale over Real Madrid absence after latest Wales call-up</h1>
      <h2>Bale has not played for Real Madrid since picking up an injury on international duty in October, but is set to play for Wales again in their next matches</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T09:43:22+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 09:43</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Richards, https://www.facebook.com/AARichards/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> midfielder <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/toni-kroos">Toni Kroos</a> has slammed <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/gareth-bale">Gareth Bale</a> for playing for Wales.</p>
      <p>Germany international Kroos, 29, has taken aim at his teammate as he addressed Bale's recent injury, when asked about his future at the Santiago Bernabeu.</p>
      <p>Bale, 30, has not played for the Spanish giants since suffering an injury while on international duty in October and is not expected to play against Eibar this weekend.</p>
      <p>But the Wales captain has been included in Ryan Giggs' squad for the upcoming Euro 2020 qualifiers against Azerbaijan and Hungary, and is expected to play.</p>

      <p>During an interview with German blog <i>Real Total</i> after Los Blancos' 6-0 win over Galatasaray on Wednesday night, Kroos, who has long been one of the Madrid stars closest to Bale, had his say.</p>
      <p>"It is a little inconvenient when you go to your national team, then you do not play for your club," said an unhappy Kroos.</p>
      <p>"After that, you are fit to play for your national team again. Maybe this is not the best time.</p>
      <p>"I hope everything is OK when he comes back."</p>

      <p>The comments came after Kroos was asked about the Bale's future at the Spanish club and admitted that it is an awkward situation for all concerned.</p>
      <p>After initially stating "I do not know", Kroos added: "He was already about to leave the club in summer.</p>
      <p>"After these types of things, where they both [club and player] seem to have moved on, it is difficult to return to normality.</p>
      <p>"Taking that into account, I have got the impression that he is motivated and has also had a few notable performances."</p>
      <p>Wales are currently fourth in Group E, with eight points from six games so far.</p>
      <p>Victory in Baku, against an Azerbaijan side with just one point from their six matches, is imperative for Giggs' side as they aim to reach next summer's finals.</p>
