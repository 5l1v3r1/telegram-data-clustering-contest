      <h1>'The A-List: Country' is the Next Apple Music Playlist to Receive a Name Change, Now 'Today's Country'</h1>

      <p>After updating its "The A-List" playlists for genres like alternative and hip-hop, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> has now changed "The A-List: Country" to "Today's Country." This playlist will essentially be the same, keeping track of all of the latest songs coming out of the country music genre, updated every day, while simply ditching "The A-List" moniker that has been around essentially since ‌Apple Music‌ launched in 2015.</p>

      <p>Apple began a large-scale playlist rebranding earlier in 2019, switching "The A-List: Dance" to "danceXL," "The A-List: Hip-Hop" to "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/07/19/apple-music-rap-life-hip-hop-playlist/">Rap Life</a>," "The A-List: Alternative" to "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/08/02/apple-music-alt-ctrl/">ALT CTRL</a>," and "Best of the Week" to "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/08/23/apple-music-launches-music-daily-playlist/">New Music Daily</a>." One of the few remaining playlists to retain the "A-List" branding is for the pop genre, which now has a simple "A-List Pop" title. <br/><br/>More niche sub-genres are still using the original A-List name style, like Bollywood, K-Pop, Classical, Mandopop, and Russian Hip-Hop. Apple has also launched brand-new playlists this year, like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/08/20/new-shazam-discovery-playlist/">Shazam Discovery Top 50</a>, which is powered by shazams made around the world to highlight up-and-coming songs and artists that users are discovering any given week.</p>
