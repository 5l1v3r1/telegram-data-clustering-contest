      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/LiverpoolFC">Liverpool</a>‘s stellar attacking line has been one of the keys behind their success over the last couple of years, reaching two <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Champions-League">Champions League</a> finals, winning one and adding the European Super Cup to their honours list, too.</p>
      <p>This season they top the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/english-premier-league">Premier League</a>, unbeaten, and will compete in seven competitions over the course of the campaign – an indication of the strength and quality of <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Jurgen_Klopp">Jurgen Klopp</a>‘s squad.</p>
      <p>It might even have looked a little stronger, though, had they got their way with one target a couple of years ago: Rodrygo Goes, the 18-year-old Brazilian who is now shining with <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/RealMadrid">Real Madrid</a>.</p>
      <p>The Spanish side agreed a deal with Rodrygo’s club Santos back in summer 2018, for a move the following year.</p>
      <p>Now, just four months after joining, he already has a Champions League hat-trick for Los Blancos and scored his first league goal for the club just one minute after coming on as sub for his debut.</p>
      <p>At least two years earlier, though, it was Liverpool who came calling.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <i>ESPN Brazil</i>, former <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> attacking midfielder Elano – then the caretaker manager at Santos who called Rodrygo up to the first team - has explained how the Reds tried to negotiate a deal for the youngster.</p>
      <p>“There was a period when there was very strong interest from Liverpool for him to leave when he was still at [the Academy] base,” Elano <a href="https://www.espn.com.br/futebol/artigo/_/id/6282249/elano-conta-como-rodrygo-quase-foi-ao-liverpool-antes-de-brilhar-no-santos-e-ir-para-o-real-madrid">said</a>.</p>
      <p>“The values ​​were very low, but they wanted to have a go. Real’s offer afterwards was around €30m more!</p>
      <p>“I had a conversation with the staff and said the boy was worth the bet [to keep hold of] and we should raise him because I would like to work with him. Thankfully everything worked out for Rodrygo’s benefit!”</p>

      <p>Elano’s words would suggest Liverpool tried to sign Rodrygo for around €10-15 million (£8-13m), given Real paid between €40-45 million for his signature.</p>
      <p>The Reds would have been attempting to sign him in early 2017 at the latest, possibly before, as he debuted for Santos in November of that year.</p>
      <p>Liverpool weren’t the only club aware of him even at that stage, of course; Barcelona thought they had a deal <a href="https://www.sport-english.com/en/news/barca/why-did-barcelona-miss-out-on-real-madrids-teenage-star-rodrygo-goes-7718514">wrapped up</a> for him after Real Madrid concluded a deal for Vinicius Jr, while Juventus were also credited with an interest.</p>
