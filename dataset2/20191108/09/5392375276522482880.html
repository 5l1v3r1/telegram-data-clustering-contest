      <p>Huawei continues to expand its portfolio of devices before the end of the year.

We will see its main technical characteristics as well as its price and availability.</p>
      <p>First, it should be noted that the phone is a kind of Honor 9X Pro to which <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/Huawei">Huawei</a> has changed the Kirin 810 processor, for a more modest Kirin 710F. The new Huawei Y9s shares many of its technical features with the last Honor phone.</p>

      <h3>Price and availability</h3>
      <p>The Huawei Y9s has a price of about $239 and arrives in black and pearl colors. At the moment we do not know the plans of <a href="https://consumer.huawei.com/levant/phones/y9s/">Huawei</a> for its commercialization in the global markets, but we know that it has been announced by the official account of Huawei in Iraq, so it seems to be the first country in which the device will land. We will be attentive to the movements of the firm regarding its launch in the other counties.</p>
