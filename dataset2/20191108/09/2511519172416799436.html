      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/phoebe-waller-bridge">Phoebe Waller-Bridge</a> has revealed how she changed the script for the new James Bond film <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/no-time-to-die?CMP=ILC-refresh"><i>No Time to Die</i></a>.</p>
      <p>Bond star Daniel Craig <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/daniel-craig-phoebe-waller-bridge-james-bond-no-time-die-script-gender-interview-a9183191.html">recently revealed it was his idea</a> to bring the <i>Fleabag</i> writer on board to help out with the script for the forthcoming movie, which marks his fifth and final outing as the spy. </p>
      <p>"They were just looking for tweaks across a few of the characters and a few of the storylines," Waller-Bridge told <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-50331077"><i>BBC News</i></a>. </p>
      <p><i>No Time to Die</i> will be the first film of the franchise released in the #MeToo era, but Waller-Bridge insisted the culture of the movies – which has often been criticised as misogynistic – was beginning to change regardless of her input.</p>
      <p>"They were already doing that themselves," she says. "They're having that conversation with themselves the whole time. It [my involvement] was much more practical. Just, 'You're a writer, we need some help with these scenes... Come up with some dialogue for these characters.’"</p>
      <p>Craig has denied that Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s gender had anything to do with her hiring, refuting a “cynical” reading that her recruitment was an attempt to make Bond more representative behind the scenes. </p>
      <p>“Look, we’re having a conversation about Phoebe’s gender here, which is f***ing ridiculous,” Craig told <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/magazine/culture/daniel-craig-interview-the-james-bond-actor-on-his-new-comedy-knives-out-phoebe-waller-bridge-the-problem-with-social-media-and-why-hes-not-grumpy-tzh6h538m"><i>The Sunday Times</i></a>. “She’s a great writer. Why shouldn’t we get Phoebe onto Bond?”</p>
      <p>Waller-Bridge is the second woman to have a writing credit on a Bond film across the franchise's 57-year history. Johanna Harwood co-wrote <i>Dr No</i> and <i>From Russia with Love </i>in the early 1960s.</p>
