      <h1>Rangers star Alfredo Morelos earns Europa League recognition as striker storms up UEFA Power Rankings</h1>
      <h2>The Ibrox striker netted his eleventh goal in Europe this season as he opened the scoring against Porto.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T09:16:29+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 09:16</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Doyle, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/chris-doyle/</a></address>
      <p>Rangers striker <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alfredo-morelos">Alfredo Morelos</a> is among one of the best performers in the Europa League according to the tournament's latest ratings.</p>
      <p>The Colombian's opening goal against Porto in his side's 2-0 win meant his tally is now at eleven for goals in Europe this season.</p>
      <p>And that impressive return has meant he's stormed up the competition's official <a href="https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/performancezone/#!/">power rankings</a> that assesses players' performances after every match-day.</p>
      <p>Morelos is currently at the number eight position with Sevilla forward Munir topping the charts thanks to a hattrick against Dudelange. Lazio's Sergej Milinkovic-Savic and Eintracht Frankfurt midfielder Filip Kostic make up the top three.</p>

      <p>Morelos' smart finish and assist for Steven Davis to double <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a>' lead proved how influential he is for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a>'s side.</p>
      <p>But other Ibrox stars have also received recognition for a brilliant <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/europa-league">Europa League</a> campaign so far as the Light Blues are tied at the top of Group G.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Borna Barisic was a constant threat down the left hand side and is ranked at number 22.</p>
      <p>James Tavernier is also listed as the second highest Englishman in the competition in between Manchester United duo Marcus Rashford and Harry Maguire.</p>
