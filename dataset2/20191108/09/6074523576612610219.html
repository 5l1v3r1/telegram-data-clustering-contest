      <h1>Silk Road Seller Pleads Guilty to Money Laundering $19 Million With Bitcoin</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T09:00:40+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author">Danny Nelson</a></address>
      <p>A former narcotics trafficker pled guilty to charges that he laundered $19 million in profit through Silk Road.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors with the Southern District of New York <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/dark-web-narcotics-trafficker-pleads-guilty-laundering-more-19-million">announced a plea deal with Hugh Brian Haney</a> on Thursday, adding another postscript to the infamous dark web marketplace’s history. According to a press release, Haney was accused of laundering close to $20 million using bitcoin in early 2018.</p>
      <p>Silk Road was among the dark web’s earliest drug marketplaces and a haven for its bitcoin-accepting vendors until its operator, Ross Ulbricht, was arrested in October 2013 and the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-milestones-silk-road-goes-dark-bitcoin-survives-its-biggest-markets-demise">site was shut down</a>. Ulbricht is currently serving <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/ross-ulbricht-sentenced">a life sentence</a> on charges of narcotics distribution, computer hacking and conspiracy. </p>
      <p>Haney was one of the sellers who used the marketplace. According to the prosecutors, Haney was a “high-ranking member” of a narcotics outfit known as Pharmville, and is said to have received nearly 4,000 bitcoin from Silk Road-linked accounts through February 2012. According to the complaint, he trafficked in fentanyl, oxycontin and other narcotic sales.</p>
      <p>“Hugh Haney used Silk Road as a means to sell drugs to people all over the world,” U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said in a statement. “Then he laundered more than $19 million in profits through cryptocurrency.”</p>
      <p>He was caught after liquidating his remaining bitcoins on an exchange for $19,147,053 in January and February 2018. The unnamed company froze his account and launched an internal investigation that ultimately led to a search warrant. Haney <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/us-attorney-announces-arrest-and-money-laundering-charges-against-dark-web-narcotics">was arrested</a> in July 2019.</p>
      <p>Initially, Haney claimed his bitcoin came from a mining operation. But investigators used “<a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/press-release/file/1184386/download">blockchain analysis software</a>” to show the funds came from Silk Road, according to the July complaint.</p>
      <p>According to his plea deal, Haney pled guilty to one count of concealing money laundering and one count of engaging in a financial transaction in criminally derived property. He is set to be sentenced in February 2020.</p>
