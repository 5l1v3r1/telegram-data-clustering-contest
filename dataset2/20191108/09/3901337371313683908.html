      <p>In matters off the field, the 26-year-old had tongues wagging after posting an image of what is believed to be his high-riding SUV.</p>
      <p>The car is question is the luxurious Jeep Grand Cherokee 3.6L Summit, which according to the carmaker’s website, is valued at R1,091,900.</p>
      <p>While there is no certainty whether it is owned by Lorch or not, it would certainly be a handsome upgrade from his Polo GTI.</p>

        <b>Do you think Lorch can inspire Pirates to victory over Kaizer Chiefs on Saturday?</b>
