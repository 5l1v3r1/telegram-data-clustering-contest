      <h2>Dubai has been named the best long-haul destination for British families thanks to its high number of attractions, hot and sunny weather, and overall value for money</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T09:55:49+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 09:55</time> by <a rel="author">Julie Delahaye, https://www.facebook.com/juliedjourno</a></address>
      <p>Parents planning their next trip with the kids may want to consider Dubai; the city has just been named the best long-haul destination for families for 2019.</p>
      <p>The United Arab Emirates' largest city proved a hit thanks to its hot and sunny weather, the plethora of family-friendly attractions on offer, as well as other factors such as the flight duration.</p>
      <p>It was followed by Cancun, Mexico, and Ras Al Khaimah, UAE, in second and third place respectively.</p>
      <p>The study, conducted by travel firm <a href="https://www.onthebeach.co.uk/">On The Beach</a>, also found Dubai to be the second best-value long-haul destination for families.</p>
      <p>Although the city doesn't have a reputation for being budget-friendly, it can be done - for example, there's a plethora of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/travel/asia-middle-east/best-cheap-hotels-dubai-you-13535995">cheap luxury hotels</a> on offer.</p>
      <p>One of the perks of Dubai is that it boasts hot and sunny weather year-round, although the best time to visit falls between October and March when you'll find average temperatures of 31C, although this drops down to around 25C in December and January.</p>

      <p>Therefore it can be an ideal destination for families looking for hot and sunny weather for the February and October half term dates - and the sea temperature is ideal if you fancy a beach break.</p>
      <p>On the Beach's research revealed that with an average flight time of six hours and 45 minutes, it also makes for one of the shortest long-haul journeys for Brits (any parent will know that flying with kids is no easy feat although we do have some <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/travel/news/ultimate-guide-surviving-flight-kids-12520175">top tips</a> to help you out!).</p>
      <p>The study also found that the city boasts the highest number of water and amusement parks of the destinations surveyed with over 20 on offer for visitors.</p>
