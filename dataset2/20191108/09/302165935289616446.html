      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 8 — Cosmetics entrepreneur Joy Revfa has called on the authorities to help put a stop to sexual harassment via social media.</p>
      <p>Joy, whose real name Siti Arifah Mohd Amin, revealed that she had been a victim, receiving pornographic images through her Instagram from fake accounts.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Malay portal <i>mStar, </i>Joy said despite blocking several accounts, there appears to be no end with individuals continuing with the despicable act.</p>
      <p>“Nearly everyday I get sexually harassed and receive messages and pornographic photos from individuals who use fake accounts.</p>
      <p>“I have blocked several of them but the harassment continues.”</p>
      <p>“It is tiring to keep on blocking accounts. For me, sexual harassment on social media is rampant,” she added.</p>
      <p>The ex-wife of Nasyid singer Hafiz Hamidun shared a pornographic image she received on her Facebook account yesterday, venting out against such acts.</p>
      <p>In the status, Joy said she wanted these cyber criminals to be arrested as they had gone overboard, and that worried about the safety of other women.</p>
      <p>“Whoever that knows this man, lock him up, He has gone overboard.”</p>
      <p>“Despite blocking them, they still harass us. They cannot be left to do whatever they want as I am worried they will start disturbing other people,” she shared.</p>
      <p>Besides Joy, other celebrities who have spoken out about being sexually harassed include Baby Shima, Zizi Kirana, Azar Azmi and Wan Sharmila.</p>
