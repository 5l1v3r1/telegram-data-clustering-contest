      <p>In August 2016, former Aston Villa and Manchester City striker Dalian Atkinson died after being tasered by police officers.</p>
      <p>The police were responding a call citing concerns for the "safety of an individual" after Atkinson had reportedly threatened to kill his father when the use of the taser was deemed necessary to defuse the situation, according to the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>.Â </p>
      <p>Atkinson, who had previously suffered health concerns, went into cardiac arrest after being tasered and was pronounced dead upon his arrival at hospital.</p>
