        <b>Congolese singer Céline Banza has been named 2019 winner of the RFI Discoveries Music Award. The jury, presided over by a host of international artists including Angélique Kidjo and Tiken Jah Fakoly, selected Banza ahead of ten finalists from across the African continent. </b>
      </p>
      <p>22-year old Céline Banza sings folk-inspired ballads and she impressed the jury with the quality of her melodies and her voice. </p>
      <p>She started out as an actress, performer and videomaker and in 2017 she inspired a short film, Tamuzi, in which she played herself. </p>
      <p>She discovered a passion for music two years ago thanks to choreographer-dancer Faustin Linyekula at Kabako Studios in east DRC where she got the chance to mix with dancers and rappers.</p>
      <p>She gave her first stage performance in the same year at the <i>Alliance Française</i> in Kinsangani.</p>
      <p>On returning to Kinshasa, her town of birth, she began studying at the <i>Institut National des Arts</i>. </p>
      <p>“I began with the guitar, then studied ethnomusicology," she told RFI. "It was good for me to discover music from elsewhere, and in other languages. That's how I realised I could sing in my native language.”</p>
      <p>In 2017, she took part in the talent show “The Voice Afrique Francophone” which confirmed her conviction to become a professional singer and she formed her own band Banza Musik. </p>
      <p>Earlier this year she performed at the Kazz Kif festival in Kinshasa and Brazzaville, then at the African Music Forum at the <i>Institut Français</i> in Kinshasa.</p>
      <p>She is currently recording her debut album, due out in 2020.</p>
      <p>“My life, the people around me, everything and everyone I meet is what inspires me as an artist.”</p>

      <p>As this year's Discoveries Award winner, Banza gets not only recognition from the jury-members, but the opportunity to bring her music to a much wider public via a concert in Paris and a tour of the African continent organised by the <i>Institut français</i>.</p>
      <p>
