      <p><b>Jonathan Fire*Eater</b>, the highly influential but often overlooked ’90s New York Rock Revival band who included three future members of <b>The Walkmen</b>, have been finally getting their due since musicians like Karen O raved about their influence in <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/nyc-indie-rock-oral-history-meet-me-in-the-bathroom-becoming-documentary-series/"><i>Meet Me In The Bathroom</i></a> and Third Man Records <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/jonathan-fireeaters-tremble-under-boom-lights-being-reissued-by-third-man/">reissued their material</a>. Sadly, frontman Stewart Lupton isn’t around for all the re-appraisal, as he <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/stewart-lupton-of-jonathan-fireeater-rip/">passed away</a> in 2018. And in Stewart’s Memory, his former Jonathan Fire*Eater bandmate (and Walkmen member) <b>Walter Martin</b> is now releasing a new solo album.</p>
      <p>The album is called <i>The World At Night</i>, and it’s dedicated to Stewart. Speaking about the album and lead single “The World at Night (for Stew),” Walter <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/8542946/walter-martin-world-at-night-stewart-lupton-exclusive">told <i>Billboard</i></a>, “‘The World at Night’ takes place inside a collage that my friend Stewart made. Stew died last year and his collage hangs above my desk where I write everyday. I’m not really a religious person but I do believe in ghosts and in magic and in plenty of beautiful stuff that I can’t see. Writing this album — and especially this song — was an effort to get closer to that stuff. And to Stew.”</p>
      <p>The album was produced by The National/Craig Finn collaborator <b>Josh Kaufman</b>, and the new single is more of a delicate, melancholic song than you might expect from Walter’s solo material. Its gorgeous arrangements are fleshed out by strings, horns, and piano, and Walter gives a wearied, poetic performance that almost sounds a little like Leonard Cohen. Listen below.</p>
      <p>The album comes out January 31 via Ile Flottante Music, and Walter will play a hometown show the next day at Brooklyn’s <b>Sultan Room (2/1)</b>. Ticket info coming soon. It’s Walter’s only upcoming show at the moment.</p>
