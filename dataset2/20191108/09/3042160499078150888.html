      <h1>Lil Rel Explains Why He Never Liked R. Kelly, Even Before the Misconduct Allegations</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T09:00:36+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://atlantablackstar.com/author/dnelson/" target="_blank">Daryl Nelson</a></address>
      <p><a href="http://atlantablackstar.com/tag/lil-rel-howery/"><b>Lil Rel Howery</b></a> said he’s never been a fan of fellow Chicagoan <a href="http://atlantablackstar.com/tag/r-kelly/"><b>R. Kelly</b></a> and that was way before he was slapped with multiple charges relating to sexual impropriety.</p>
      <p>Howery was a guest on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” on Wednesday, where he talked about working on the video for “Trapped in the Closet,” Kelly’s R&amp;B opera.</p>

      <p>Besides being charged with 21 counts of misconduct in the state of Illinois, Kelly has been hit with <a href="https://atlantablackstar.com/2019/07/12/r-kelly-arrested-on-federal-sex-crimes-charges-as-hes-walking-his-dog-in-chicago/">several felony charges</a>, and they all came after the docuseries <a href="http://atlantablackstar.com/tag/surviving-r-kelly/"><b>“Surviving R. Kelly”</b></a> aired in January.</p>
      <p>Kelly was accused of sexual, physical and emotional abuse in the release, and he’s also been accused of controlling the women he’s been with, which Howery said he witnessed.</p>
      <p>“I did stand-in work for R. Kelly’s ‘Trapped in the Closet’ series. I did stand-in for the cop <a href="http://atlantablackstar.com/tag/Michael-k-williams/"><b>Michael K. Williams</b></a>,” he began. “For years everybody was like, ‘Rel, why don’t you like R. Kelly like that?'”</p>
      <p>“It was another stand-in, a young lady that was actually one of his background dancers for a couple of his tours,” Howery continued.</p>
      <p>“And we were just talking the whole time, getting to know each other, laughing and having a good time. But every time she laughed, I found him just, like, staring at me. So we come back to set the next day right and she’s not talking to us at all,” he explained.</p>
      <p>Howery then asked the women if he did something wrong and why she wasn’t speaking to him.</p>
      <p>“‘He doesn’t want me talking to y’all no more'” he said she told him. “And I said ‘Who?’ ‘Robert.’ … So she didn’t talk to us the rest of the time we were filming it and it was just crazy and I remember him smirking about it.”</p>
      <p>But that wasn’t the last time Howery would be in the same place as Kelly, because they both ended up at <a href="http://atlantablackstar.com/tag/john-singleton/"><b>John Singleton</b></a>‘s birthday party, where the disgraced singer sent someone over for an introduction.</p>
      <p>“I guess he wanted to meet me, and he sent somebody to me and we were all in this VIP area … ‘Man, I’m good,'” Howery remembered saying.</p>
      <p>“It wasn’t even about the allegations with me,” he added. “He was so extra like that sometimes, and I ain’t like that. Everybody knows I’m from the West Side of Chicago, and I own who I am. That’s too much, bro. Just come speak to me, fam … To send somebody that was just so weird to me.”</p>
      <p>On the career front, Howery will be starring in the upcoming film “Bad Trip” with <a href="http://atlantablackstar.com/tag/tiffany-haddish/"><b>Tiffany Haddish</b></a> and “Fatherhood” with <a href="http://atlantablackstar.com/tag/kevin-hart/"><b>Kevin Hart</b></a>, both expected to be in theaters next year.</p>
      <p>As for Kelly, he’s pleaded not guilty to all of the charges.</p>
