      <p>OnePlus’s upcoming flagship smartphone dubbed OnePlus 8 Pro will feature a 120Hz display, according to famous leakster Max J. On the other hand, the OnePlus 8 is likely to feature a display similar to the OnePlus 7 Pro, meaning that the former is going to settle on a 90Hz display.</p>

      <p>Smartphones that come with a 120Hz display refresh rate are quite less in number at this moment — ASUS ROG Phone II, Razer Phone, Razer Phone 2, and Sharp Aquos R3 are the smartphone that packs a display with such high refresh rate. It’s not the highest though — the Sharp Aquos zero2 have a 240Hz OLED panel!</p>
      <p>Aside from OnePlus 8 Pro, <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/xiaomi-reportedly-to-join-the-elite-group-of-smartphones-with-120hz-display/">Xiaomi is also considering introducing its first-ever smartphone with a 120hz display panel</a>.</p>
      <p>Leaked renders have suggested that the OnePlus 8 Pro is going to feature the punch-hole camera design, which is similar to the one found in the leaked renders of the OnePlus 8, Samsung Galaxy S10 and Note 10 series of smartphones. OnePlus 8 Pro will have curved edges, like its predecessor and the size of the display panel is tipped to be 6.65-inch, slightly bigger than the 6.5-inch panel on the OnePlus 8.</p>
      <p>It’s rumored to have a quad-camera setup, all cameras arranged vertically, at the back — the fourth camera is expected to be a  depth-sensing 3D ToF, which finds its application in 3D photography, AR, portrait mode images, etc. Other specs include a hole for the mic at the top edge, USB Type-C port flanked by a redesigned speaker grille at the bottom. OnePlus 8 Pro will measure 165.3 x 74.4 x 8.8mm in size.</p>
