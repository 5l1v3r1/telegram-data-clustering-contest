      <h3>Preview</h3>
      <p>Kerala Blasters will be under heavy pressure to face Odisha FC in front of the passionate Kochi fans on Friday at the Jawarharlal Nehru Stadium in Kochi.  Blasters are performing poorly in every department and are struggling with injuries to foreign players as well. Their only win came against ATK in the season opener as they reel at the eighth position on the table.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Odisha FC are riding on high confidence after their goal scoring night in Mumbai to win their first game of the season with a 4-2 scoreline. Even though they have two losses, they have fought well in those games and sitting sixth on the table with the same points as Kerala but with superior goal difference.</p>
      <h3>Key Players</h3>
      <p>Eelco Schattorie's key player is Nigerian Bartholomew Ogbeche, who has two goals in his account this season, while Blasters have scored only three goals. Schattorie brought Sahal Abdul Samad in the starting eleven against Hyderabad, who assisted Rahul KP for a goal and the Dutchman might again hand a chance to the Kerala Duo in the starting eleven.</p>
      <p>In the Odisha camp, the Spanish duo of Xisco Hernandez and Aridane Sandane are in excellent form having five goals between them in three games. Young Jerry Mawihmingthanga, however, is the key Indian player under Josep Gombau's disposal alongside Spain’s Aridane Santana.</p>
      <h3>Team News</h3>
      <p>Kerala Blasters faced a huge blow in the previous match against Hyderabad FC by injuring Dutch defender Gianni Zuiverloon. The yellow brigade has previously lost star defender Sandesh Jhingan during the pre-season and Schattorie is more worried about the absence of another foreigner Mario Arques.</p>
      <p>Odisha boss Josep Gombau may bring back Carlos Delgado to the defence who was earlier suspended for a red card. Spanish goalkeeper Francisco Dorronsoro should be making way for Indian goalkeeper Arshdeep Singh. The Spaniard will be pleased to field a strong fit side.</p>
      <h3>Head to Head</h3>
      <p>Both teams faced each other 12 times ( Odisha FC formerly Delhi Dynamos ). Both of them won four times and the four went on to draw.</p>
