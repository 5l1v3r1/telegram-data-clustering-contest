      <p>In the weeks since it launched, Apple Arcade has won over many with its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/11/apple-arcade-inmost-mind-symphony/?_guc_consent_skip=1573211891">affordable price</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/16/apple-arcade-hands-on-overworld-shinsekai/?_guc_consent_skip=1573211747">wide variety of games</a>. Despite some <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/11/apple-arcade-is-a-tough-sell/?_guc_consent_skip=1573211748">initial skepticism</a>, the service <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/18/apple-arcade-review">impressed our editorial team</a> as a way to break from the low-quality free-to-play games that previously dominated mobile gaming.</p>
      <p>Now, the Arcade has reached a milestone of 100 games available to play.</p>
      <p>The six new games added today include <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015/11/12/sensible-soccer-is-getting-a-modern-remake/?_guc_consent_skip=1573214724"><i>Sociable Soccer</i></a>, sequel to the beloved <i>Sensible Soccer</i> which was popular during the early '90s. The new game, in which you collect player cards and represent your favorite club, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015/11/26/sociable-soccer-kickstarter-cancelled/?_guc_consent_skip=1573214708">struggled to build up interest</a> on Kickstarter despite nostalgia for its predecessor. The sequel made it to Steam Early Access though, and from there it was snapped up to be part of the Apple Arcade.</p>
      <p>Other new titles include <i>UFO on Tape: First Contact</i>, a sequel to an early iPhone game, 2010's <i>UFO on Tape</i>. This AR game simulates the experience of being a UFO hunter, chasing down a strange object in the sky and recording it with a video camera.</p>
      <p>There's also <i>Takeshi &amp; Hiroshi</i>, a puppet-based RPG staring two young brothers, <i>Guildlings</i>, an episodic adventure that mixes high fantasy with modern world elements, <i>Discolored</i>, an atmospheric puzzle adventure all about color and <i>Marble It Up: Mayhem</i>, a puzzle-platformer based on the popular <i>Marble It Up!</i> game.</p>
