      <p>The weekend is here and while many are hoping to enjoy a few days away from the mill, unfortunately the weather on Saturday looks likely to put an end to any outdoor plans.</p>
      <p>According to local weather expert Louth Weather, in an update on Facebook this morning, there "a lot of rain lineout through the day".</p>
      <p>However, Sunday is looking likely to be a good day with a mix of cloud and sunshine.</p>
      <p>It's going to be cooler over the coming days with frost at night.</p>
