      <p>Winter is coming to the East Coast for the next week.</p>
      <p>The next five to seven days are going to bring unseasonably cold temperatures to<b> </b>the eastern two-thirds of the US, CNN meteorologist Derek Van Dam said.</p>
      <p>The cold front could bring<b> </b>below freezing temperatures to some places.</p>
      <p>The cold was already descending on New York early Friday morning, with wind chill expected to bring temperatures down to the upper teens to mid-20s, according to the National Weather Service. Wind gusts in Boston are reaching 25 to 35 mph and will bring temperatures to the 20s as well, the NWS said.</p>
      <p>Snow flurries are also expected for the downwind parts of the Great Lakes Friday, Van Dam said, adding that those flurries will be at the Northern Great Lakes Saturday.</p>
      <p>"The Great Lakes are no longer ice covered, so here comes the Lake Effect snow again," the National Weather Service said.</p>
