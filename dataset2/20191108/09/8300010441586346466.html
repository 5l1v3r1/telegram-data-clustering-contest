      <p>SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (KABC) -- Nicole Salazar has an entire cupboard set aside in her kitchen for the medications her 6-year-old son, Jeremiah, must rely on.<br/><br/>"Jeremiah was diagnosed with epilepsy at two. At age four we transferred care to Children's Hospital of Los Angeles where he got diagnosis of Lennox Gastaut Syndrome," said Salazar.<br/><br/>Despite his energetic appearance the first grader battles with daily debilitating seizures.<br/><br/>Three years ago, Salazar turned to cannabis oil to get his symptoms under control.<br/><br/>"He still has seizures but they are not as intense not as often. Jeremiah has been doing decently well with his seizures," she said.<br/><br/>Jeremiah now receives five daily does of the oil derived from the marijuana plant. But that has led to another battle with the San Bernardino City Unified School District.<br/><br/>"They don't want me to give it to him period," said Salazar.<br/><br/>The school district is in a difficult position.<br/><br/>Federal law bans medical marijuana use on school grounds. If the school district violates the law if could lose federal funding.<br/><br/>For now, it's also illegal under state law, but in January a new law will allow for medical marijuana on K-12 campuses. School districts will still be allowed to opt out if they choose.<br/><br/>The San Bernardino City Unified School District issued this statement to Eyewitness News:<br/><br/>"In January of 2020, new state legislation will allow a parent to administer medicinal cannabis on a school campus, however, the law does not require a school nurse or other school personnel to administer medicinal cannabis.<br/><br/>Cannabis continues to be classified federally as a Schedule I Controlled Substance (Drug Enforcement Administration DEA, n.d.) and is not allowed on a school campus. As a school district, we receive federal funding and the federal and state laws are in conflict. The San Bernardino City Unified School District is seeking a legal opinion on the matter."<br/><br/>For now Salazar will continue to treat her son with cannabis oil.<br/><br/>"It is OK for him to have valium in class... but God forbid we have a plant that is changing things not just for him but for million of kids like him."</p>
