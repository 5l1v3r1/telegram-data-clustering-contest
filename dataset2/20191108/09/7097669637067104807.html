      <h1>Hundreds of bones found in world's first mammoth trap, set by humans 14,000 years ago</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T09:42:51+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 09:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/" target="_blank">Agence France-Presse</a></address>
      <p>Archaeologists say they have made the largest-ever discovery of mammoth remains: a trove of 800 bones from at least 14 of the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2019/03/03/ice-age-return-mammoth-review-remarkable-discoveries-feel-like/">extinct giants</a> found in central Mexico.</p>
      <p>Moreover, they believe they have made the first-ever find of a mammoth trap set by humans, who would have used it to capture the huge herbivores more than 14,000 years ago, said Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH).</p>
      <p>"This is the largest find of its kind ever made," the institute said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The skeletal remains were found in Tultepec, near the site where President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's government is building a new airport for Mexico City.</p>
      <p>Some bore signs that the animals had been hunted, leading experts to conclude that they had found "the world's first mammoth trap," it said. </p>

      <p>"Mammoths lived here for thousands of years. The herds grew, reproduced, died, were hunted... They lived alongside other species, including horses and camels," archaeologist Luis Cordoba told journalists.</p>
      <p>Researchers said at least five mammoth herds lived in the area of the find.</p>
      <p>Mexico has been the scene of surprising mammoth discoveries before. In the 1970s, workers building the Mexico City subway found a mammoth skeleton while digging on the capital's north side.</p>
