      <p>Dec Donnelly was beaming a huge smile as he landed in Australia ahead of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!</a></p>
      <p>The Geordie presenter was snapped today arriving at the Gold Coast Airport in Queensland with his wife Ali Astall and their baby girl Isla.</p>
      <p>The 44-year-old is due to kick off the show next Sunday, with the first celebs scheduled to touch down in Oz this weekend.</p>
      <p>Dec looked like he was raring to go as he threw photographers a thumbs up as he headed to a waiting car.</p>
      <p>The star had dressed comfortably for his long flight in jeans and a black T-shirt with a black bomber jacket on top.</p>

      <p>He rested a pair of sunglasses on his head and had a huge smile on his face.</p>
      <p>He's set to be reunited on the show with his best pal Ant McPartlin, who missed presenting the series last year as he took time off to concentrate on his recovery following his drink-drive conviction.</p>
      <p>Their old pal, and fellow ITV star, Holly Willoughby stepped in to help Dec out.</p>
      <p>But this series, the duo will be back together once more, leading this year's campmates through jungle life and Bushtucker trials.</p>

      <p>Dec arrived at the airport with a team of people, including his wife Ali, who looked effortlessly gorgeous in a dark khaki jumpsuit.</p>
      <p>Dec's little girl Isla, who the happy couple welcomed last year, was with him too, being pushed through the airport in her stroller by an assistant as Dec walked ahead pulling his suitcase.</p>
      <p>This year's cast is rumoured to include US reality star Caitlyn Jenner, Capital FM breakfast host Roman Kemp, Good Morning Britain's Kate Garraway and former football ace Ian Wright, among many others.</p>

      <p>But their stay in the jungle might be even more uncomfortable than usual thanks to the recent heatwave.</p>
      <p>It's said that a "plague of reptiles" has invaded the camp.</p>
      <p>The Australian Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning have issued a warning about the threats that could be posed because of the heat.</p>
      <p>* I'm A Celeb returns to ITV at 9pm on Sunday, November 17</p>
