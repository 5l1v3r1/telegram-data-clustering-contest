      <p>The scrimmage, organized as a favor to the Garrett family, allowed Kevin Garrett to watch his son K.J. play for possibly the last time before the elder Garrett succumbs to a rare form of bladder cancer, <a href="https://www.wxii12.com/article/this-might-be-the-last-time-my-dad-gets-to-see-me-play-high-schools-put-on-basketball-scrimmage-so-a-dad-with-cancer-can-see-his-son-play-one-more-time/29691501">WXII reported</a>.</p>

High Point Christian Academy's 2019-20 basketball season has not yet begun.</p>
      <p>A livestream broadcast, however, made it possible for Kevin to watch from his hospice bed as K.J. took the court one last time.</p>
