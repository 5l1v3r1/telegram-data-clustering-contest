        <b>Having learned about the arrest of senior cricketer CM Gautam and Abrar Kazi of the Karnataka Premier League following match-fixing allegations have left a deep impact on a former Karnataka coach. He shared that he can’t even imagine it and advocated for mentoring of players about moral values.</b>

      <p>The Karnataka Premier League (KPL) has been in unwanted limelight lately following arrests of multiple players and even coaches following the allegations of match-fixing and betting scam. The most recent arrests have been that of senior cricketer CM Gautam and Abrar Kazi, and it has left Karnataka Cricket in deep shock and anguish.</p>
      <p>The Bellary Tuskers players, who have stated before that they didn’t find anything unusual during the KPL final, have expressed their shock about the recent proceedings. A former Karnataka coach has resounded the player sentiments.</p>
      <p>“I’m really shocked; I’m feeling absolutely low. It is impossible to even imagine. I never thought such big names would be involved, if they are indeed guilty. It’s not as if they are some young, gullible players,” the coach told Sportstar.</p>
      <p>“Players need to be mentored; they need moral values. The most important thing in life is self-respect and how you have lived. Money is not everything. It is important, but not at the cost of everything else."</p>
      <p>The captain of a KPL side has expressed his concern about the respect of the State and its cricket board after the fiasco has been uncovered.</p>
      <p>“I always thought that big cricketers generally don't get involved in such things. Why do they need to? But this is very very surprising,” he said.</p>
      <p>“If you see the reputation Karnataka cricket enjoys, this comes as a huge shock. Forget this controversy, we don’t even have simple friendly fights and arguments on the field! That's how good Karnataka cricket is. When I was playing, I didn't even think such [scams] could be possible here.”</p>
      <p>A top Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) official said that the administrative and cricketing fraternity was left deeply disappointed with the arrests.</p>
      <p>“I do not think any level of player should get involved in such kind of cases. It is very unfortunate and disappointing that such big players are involved. Now depending on where the investigations go, we may even consider life bans."</p>
