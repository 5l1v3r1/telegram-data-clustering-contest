        <b>He'll head back to Stockholm next month</b>

      <p><a href="http://nme.com/artists/asap-rocky">A$AP Rocky</a> has announced that he will return to Sweden next month for his first show in the country since he was convicted of assault.</p>
      <p>The US rapper was <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/asap-rocky-arrested-street-fight-sweden-2523369">arrested earlier this year in Sweden on suspicion of assault</a> following a fight between his entourage and another man. <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/aap-rocky-listed-his-nickname-as-pretty-mother-fucker-in-swedish-police-documents-2532958">Rocky listed his nickname as “pretty mother fucker”</a> in Swedish police documents.</p>
      <p>He was released on August 2 before being found <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/aap-rocky-found-guilty-assault-stockholm-arrest-2538084">guilty of assault and handed a suspended sentence</a> and ordered to pay damages.</p>
      <p>Now, it’s been confirmed that he’ll return to Stockholm’s Ericsson Globe to play a show on December 11.</p>
      <p>A cut of proceeds will reportedly go to local charity FARR, the Swedish Network of Refugee Support Groups.</p>

      <p>Last month, he also provided fans with an<a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/aap-rocky-says-hes-holding-off-sharing-swedish-prison-stories-new-music-2553642"> update about what to expect from his new music.</a></p>
      <p>“Right now I am working on, I would say, something that is highly anticipated because a lot of people want to know how I am feeling about the whole situation,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Making music is fun. It’s always fun. In a way, it’s a parallel with fashion because I think the right key, the right silhouette, the right look — the right expression — can trigger an emotional connection: sometimes a nostalgic connection and sometimes an enticing connection with people.”</p>
