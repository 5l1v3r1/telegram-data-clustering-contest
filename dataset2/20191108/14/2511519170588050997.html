      <h1>Pep Guardiola open to possibility of managing in Italy after time at Man City ends</h1>
      <h2>Guardiola’s playing career took him to Serie A in 2001</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Pep_Guardiola">Pep Guardiola</a> says he’s perfectly happy with life in the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/english-premier-league">Premier League</a> right now, but remains open to the possibility of a job in Italy after he leaves <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a>.</p>
      <p>The Spanish tactician has managed in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/La_Liga">LaLiga</a>, the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> and now in England’s top flight, winning the domestic title in each, and a move to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Serie_A">Serie A</a> would be a logical next step.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Juventus">Juventus</a> were reportedly keen on luring him to Italy this past summer, though Guardiola has dismissed that suggestion.</p>
      <p>The Turin club, along with perhaps Inter Milan, might be seen as the probable destinations if he does head to Serie A, but for now he remains focused on the task at hand.</p>
      <p>Guardiola told <i>Sky Italy</i> that he enjoyed his time in Serie A as a player, when he joined Roma and Brescia for short stays toward the end of his career.</p>
      <p>“Training in Italy? Why not,” he <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/11857143/pep-guardiola-open-to-italy-move-after-man-city-reign">said</a>. “It was a pleasure [to be there] as a player, with the great (Carlo) Mazzone [ex-Brescia manager].</p>
      <p>“I had a great time and I love the country but now I feel good in England, it’s a great championship. But maybe yes, I’m not that old.”</p>
      <p>Since joining Manchester City in 2016, Guardiola has won two league titles and did the domestic treble last year.</p>
      <p>European trophies have thus far evaded him since 2011, when he won the Champions League with Barcelona for the second time.</p>
      <p>At present, Guardiola is preparing his <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/liverpool-vs-manchester-city-preview-prediction-salah-firmino-mane-migue-delaney-a9194631.html">City side to face Liverpool in a clash at the top of the Premier League</a>, with City trailing the Reds by six points ahead of the weekend encounter.</p>
      <p>His current deal with Man City ends in 2021.</p>
