      <p>The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/haryana-government">Haryana government </a>is likely to provide support of Rs 100/quintal from Saturday to small and marginal farmers who have not burned stubble in their fields.</p>
      <p>Sanjeev Kaushal, the additional chief secretary of excise and taxation and ACS of agriculture and farmers Welfare, said on Friday that Chief Minister <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/manohar-lal-khattar">Manohar Lal Khattar </a>is likely to take a final decision in this regard within a day.</p>
      <p>He said after a meeting held by the department concerned, the proposal was sent to the chief minister for his consent.</p>
      <p>Asked about the number of farmers who will be benefited and the amount estimated to be paid by the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/haryana-government">Haryana government </a>to them, Kaushal said all this will be known after the chief minister's clearance.</p>
      <p>Officials of the Agriculture and Revenue Department and Finance Department held a meeting in this regard to work out the modalities.</p>
      <p>An estimated 20 lakh farmers in Haryana cultivate on less than five acres of land. The government has information of land and bank accounts of all the farmers.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court, which lashed out at authorities on Wednesday for failing to curb severe air pollution in the Delhi-NCR region, had directed the governments of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to provide support of Rs 100/quintal within seven days to small and marginal farmers who have not burned the stubble.</p>
