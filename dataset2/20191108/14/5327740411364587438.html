      <h1>No-fee adoption event in Surrey to help animals find a ‘Home Fur the Holidays’</h1>
      <h2>Surrey Animal Resource Centre built ‘adoption room’ with grant funding</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T14:00:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.northdeltareporter.com/author/lauren-collins/" target="_blank">Lauren Collins</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/surreyanimalresourcecentre">Surrey Animal Resource Centre</a> is hoping some animals will find their forever home in an upcoming no-fee adoption event.</p>
      <p>Surrey Animal Resource Centre was given a $37,500-grant in March by Match MG Canada, which was used for improvements at the centre, including the construction of an adoption room.</p>
      <p>The adoption room gives families a chance to interact with a potential pet prior to adopting.</p>
      <p>To celebrate the improvements, SARC will be hosting a no-fee adoption event called “Home Fur the Holidays” Nov. 16 and 17, from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the centre (17944 Colebrook Rd.).</p>
      <p>SARC, according to the city’s website, has decided to hold the no-fee event “to increase adoptions, reduce length of stay in the shelter and create opportunities to take in more animals in need.”</p>
      <p>“Our goal is to find the animals in our care a home for the holidays. An increase in adoptions creates more opportunity to help even more animals in need,” said shelter manager Shelley Joaquin.</p>
      <p>“Our adoption matching process will remain the same to ensure it is a good environment for the animal and a good match for the person.”</p>
      <p>For more information on the event, visit <a href="https://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/30275.aspx">surrey.ca/culture-recreation/30275.aspx</a>.</p>
      <p>The SARC is the animal-control centre for the city. It helps animals and humans in the community with licensing, reuniting animals with their owners and adopting.</p>
