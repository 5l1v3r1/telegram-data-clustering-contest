        <i>Nicola Sturgeon confirms her party’s priority is fresh independence referendum</i>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nicola-sturgeon">Nicola Sturgeon</a> has warned Jeremy Corbyn she would demand a second independence referendum next year as her price to support a minority Labour government at Westminster.</p>
      <p>She confirmed the Scottish National party’s (SNP’s) priority at this election was staging a fresh vote on independence next year, even if <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour">Labour</a> was able to win a new deal from the EU and put that to a second European referendum.</p>
      <p>Sturgeon, the SNP’s leader and first minister, said the last three years of chaos at Westminster made it clear <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland">Scotland</a> had to have the choice of leaving the UK. She said this was the most important general election the country had ever faced.</p>
      <p>“The future of our country is at stake, not just for the next five years – but for the generations to come,” she said as she launched the SNP’s general election campaign in Edinburgh.</p>
      <p>“[After] the last three years, it is impossible to escape the conclusion that for Scotland, Westminster is utterly broken. It is taking Scotland down the wrong path – and it is doing so against our will.”</p>
      <p>Sturgeon said again the SNP “would drive a hard bargain” with Corbyn on supporting a minority Labour government, which would be conditional on his backing for a second referendum.</p>
      <p>However, she did not directly answer a question on whether the SNP would refuse to support a Labour budget if Corbyn failed to approve a second independence vote in 2020 – a move that could threaten the survival of a Corbyn administration.</p>
      <p>Sturgeon instead suggested Corbyn would do a deal with her to allow one next year, implying that question would not arise. “I don’t think anybody who steps back from this would be surprised to hear me say that the SNP is not going to be giving support for parties that do not recognise the central principle of the right of the people of Scotland to choose their own future,” she said.</p>
      <p>“I’m not sure that’s the position Jeremy Corbyn will find himself in. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> is someone who has supported self-determination for literally every other country in the world. It would be mightily strange if he didn’t support it for Scotland.</p>
      <p>“The comments he has made and the comments John McDonnell [the shadow chancellor] has made have given a pretty clear sense of the direction of Labour’s travel on this.”</p>
      <p>In a controversial change in Labour policy which Sturgeon again welcomed, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/15/corbyn-westminster-should-not-block-second-scottish-independence-vote">Corbyn and McDonnell said in August</a> the party would agree to give the Scottish parliament the powers to hold that referendum if Holyrood demanded them.</p>
      <p>But Labour has since hardened its stance by stating it would not authorise one in the first few years of a Labour government, and would force Sturgeon to seek a mandate for independence in the 2021 Holyrood election.</p>
      <p>Corbyn and McDonnell have repeatedly said they would not do deals with opposition parties at Westminster, and would instead challenge parties like the SNP, the Liberal Democrats or the Greens to endorse Labour’s budget.</p>
      <p>Scottish opinion polls suggest the SNP will increase its number of Westminster seats to around 45 – a view endorsed privately by other parties – regaining some it lost in the 2017 snap election. It currently holds 35 out of Scotland’s 59 Westminster constituencies. Sturgeon has made clear she would regard that result as a clear mandate in favour of a second independence vote.</p>
      <p>Sturgeon herself has ruled out doing a formal deal with Labour, saying the SNP would vote on a policy-by-policy basis. Labour strategists believe Sturgeon would be forced to compromise if Corbyn offered her an independence vote at a later date.</p>
      <p>Sturgeon insisted the SNP expected to play a full role at Westminster, introducing new UK-wide policies and also by demanding devolution of fresh powers to Holyrood.</p>
      <p>The SNP will table a new NHS protection bill in the Commons immediately after the election to outlaw future governments including the NHS in trade deals, and prevent private health firms from going to court to force privatisation of NHS services or force up the price of medicines.</p>
      <p>The SNP would also demand tougher action on climate change at UK level, while asking for powers over migration, employment law and drug policy to be devolved to Holyrood.</p>
