      <p>Friday on CNN’s “New Day,” Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) weighed in on former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg potentially entering the 2020 presidential race.</p>
      <p>Khanna pushed back against the idea, saying he does not see the United States wanting to elect “another New York billionaire after Donald Trump.”</p>
      <p>“Well, John, do you think the country really wants another New York billionaire after Donald Trump?” Khanna asked host John Berman. “Usually, we elect the opposite. And so I just don’t think this is the time where his vision or his ideas are going to resonate.”</p>
      <p>The congressman from California admitted Bloomberg has done good work in fighting climate change and gun violence, but voiced his concern with the former mayor’s comments on the #MeToo movement and stop and frisk.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think he has progressive economic ideas,” Khanna added. “And frankly, I just don’t think this country needs another billionaire running for political office.”</p>
