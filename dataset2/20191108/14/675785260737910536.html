      <p>The world of <a href="https://www.thepools.com/KSI-Logan-Paul?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationwide&amp;utm_campaign=editorial_5_free_bet_ksi-loganpaul">YouTube collides with the professional world of boxing</a> after less than a handful of bouts of white-collar boxing.</p>
      <p>YouTubers <a href="https://www.thepools.com/KSI-Logan-Paul?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationwide&amp;utm_campaign=editorial_5_free_bet_ksi-loganpaul">KSI</a> - who made his name making FIFA videos - and <a href="https://www.thepools.com/KSI-Logan-Paul?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationwide&amp;utm_campaign=editorial_5_free_bet_ksi-loganpaul">Logan Paul</a> - who initially made his name on Vine - fight for the first time on the professional scene.</p>
      <p>The amateur bout last year turned a few heads, noticeably promoter <a href="https://www.thepools.com/KSI-Logan-Paul?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationwide&amp;utm_campaign=editorial_5_free_bet_ksi-loganpaul">Eddie Hearn</a> who was amazed by the views and pay-per-view numbers it received.</p>
      <p>Hearn was asked to promote the amateur bout last year but declined before seeing the fight drew 28million views and nearly £3million from ticket sales alone.</p>
      <p>It is safe to say Eddie Hearn has delivered his promise in bringing a world championship title fight to the night too.</p>
      <p>I mean <a href="https://www.thepools.com/KSI-Logan-Paul?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationwide&amp;utm_campaign=editorial_5_free_bet_ksi-loganpaul">Billy Joe Saunders</a> is on the undercard! Under. Card.</p>

      <p>
        <b>How did we get here?</b>
      </p>
      <p>It all started when KSI fought fellow YouTuber Joe Weller at the Copper Box Arena last year.</p>
      <p>The fight was a success with 1.6 million live viewers and 21 million viewers with a day.</p>
      <p>KSI called out the Paul brothers and initially challenged Logan’s younger brother Jake to fight before Logan stepped up.</p>
      <p>Jake later agreed to fight Deji in a co-main event ticket.</p>
      <p>Deji will not be fighting in the next fight - but that’s a whole other story worthy for EastEnders or <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/coronation-street">Coronation Street</a> or something.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How did the first fight go?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Well if the KSI-Weller fight was a success, <a href="https://www.thepools.com/KSI-Logan-Paul?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationwide&amp;utm_campaign=editorial_5_free_bet_ksi-loganpaul">KSI vs Logan Paul</a> was huge!</p>
      <p>The pre-fight promotional videos reached nearly 30million views alone including diss tracks reaching a combined 60 million from each of the four fighters - yes really.</p>
      <p>The live viewership was over 2.25million including more than a million pay-per-view alone and 17million alone from the official YouTube channel.</p>
      <p>During the promo for the current fight, Eddie Hearn admitted he was approached to promote the first event but said no.</p>
      <p>He later said the views and pay-per-view numbers convinced him to promote the second fight in the USA.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Who is favourite to win this fight?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Despite having a majority draw in his favour, <a href="https://www.thepools.com/KSI-Logan-Paul?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationwide&amp;utm_campaign=editorial_5_free_bet_ksi-loganpaul">KSI is 8/5 to win</a> while <a href="https://www.thepools.com/KSI-Logan-Paul?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationwide&amp;utm_campaign=editorial_5_free_bet_ksi-loganpaul">Logan Paul is the favourite at 8/13</a> with <a href="https://www.thepools.com/KSI-Logan-Paul?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationwide&amp;utm_campaign=editorial_5_free_bet_ksi-loganpaul">The Pools</a> .</p>
      <p>
        <b>Will the fight go the distance?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Like the previous fight, KSI and Logan Paul will fight in a six-round match at three minutes long each.</p>
      <p>They will be fighting at <a href="https://www.thepools.com/KSI-Logan-Paul?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationwide&amp;utm_campaign=editorial_5_free_bet_ksi-loganpaul">cruiserweight</a> but, as it is pro, they will be fighting 10oz gloves.</p>
      <p>Hearn has previously stated “someone will get knocked out” so I’m agreeing with him and saying it won’t go the distance ( <a href="https://www.thepools.com/KSI-Logan-Paul?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationwide&amp;utm_campaign=editorial_5_free_bet_ksi-loganpaul">8/15</a> ).</p>
      <p>
        <b>How will it end?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The demand in an amateur bout is nothing when you compare it to a professional fight. Granted the fact they are considered pro’s sickens the purists out there, but they are when they enter that ring.</p>
      <p>The lack of headguards will be something both fighters will be nervous about - whether their little YouTube personalities say otherwise.</p>
      <p>Logan Paul had shocking stamina and couldn’t even hold his gloves up after two rounds and I’ll be surprised if he can last four rounds to be honest.</p>
      <p>I’m backing KSI to win by TKO ( <a href="https://www.thepools.com/KSI-Logan-Paul?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationwide&amp;utm_campaign=editorial_5_free_bet_ksi-loganpaul">7/2</a> ) in the fourth round ( <a href="https://www.thepools.com/KSI-Logan-Paul?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationwide&amp;utm_campaign=editorial_5_free_bet_ksi-loganpaul">20/1</a> ).</p>
