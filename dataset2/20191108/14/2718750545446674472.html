      <h1>It’s the First Week of November, and the Jonas Brothers Have Already Released a Christmas Song</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T14:35:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 14:35</time> by <a rel="author">Justin Curto, Zoe Haylock</a></address>
      <p>We hear you: Christmas sneaks up on us earlier and earlier every year. This year, it seemed like once the clock struck midnight on November 1, everyone was <a href="https://twitter.com/MariahCarey/status/1190161809887694848?s=20">eager to trade their costumes for sweaters</a> (except for the few weirdos who kept up the Halloween antics through the weekend). And the Jonas Brothers, inspired by <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/mariah-carey-merry-christmas-25th-anniversary-reissue.html">Queen Christmas Mariah Carey</a>’s own transformation, are no exception: They just released their <i>original</i> Christmas song “Like It’s Christmas.” It’s another stage of their reunion, after the boys already gave us <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/06/jonas-brothers-happiness-begins-album-review.html">new album <i>Happiness Begins</i></a>,<i> </i><a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/06/jonas-brothers-purity-rings-documentary.html">a documentary</a>, and a tour earlier this year. (Just don’t expect to find <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/05/jonas-brothers-memoir-book-blood.html">their forthcoming memoir</a> under the tree — it’s now out next March.) With all this comeback success, every day feels “like it’s Christmas” for the brothers, even if it’s 82 degrees and sunny out.</p>
