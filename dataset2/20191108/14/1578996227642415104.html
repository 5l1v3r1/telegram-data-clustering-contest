      <p>All Kourtney Kardashian wants for a Christmas is a break from the family business. In a recent interview with <i>Entertainment Tonight</i>, the oldest Kardashian sibling revealed that she wants to take a step back from filming the show to focus more on her family.</p>
      <p>In a video interview with her sisters Kim Kardashian West and Khloe Kardashian while promoting their new KKW Fragrance, Kourtney, who shares three children—Mason, Penelope, and Reign—with Scott Disick, told ET that she isn't saying goodbye forever. "I just decided to spend more time as a mom and put more of my energy there," she said, and teased that viewers will understand her decision more on the upcoming season (18!) of <i>Keeping Up With The Kardashians</i> which is currently filming.</p>
      <p>When asked their thoughts on Kourtney's plans, Khloe wasn't exactly convinced Kourtney could actually stay away from the show. "We definitely love Kourtney and we will miss Kourtney and whatever she decides to do, but people come, people go all the time in this family," Khloé told ET. "We feel like it’s a revolving door, so Kourtney might leave this week, she’ll be back."</p>
      <p>Kourtney has opened up about stepping back from the limelight to focus on her children several times before. Recently, she appeared on <i>The Real</i> and was asked if Kylie's billionaire status was intimidating for the family, to which Kourtney replied, "And that's a thing I always think to myself—'When is it enough?' Because I don't like missing out on certain things, like doing my kids' homework or certain after school activities or different things like that."</p>
      <p>Outside of KUWTK, Kourtney also runs her own wellness and lifestyle <a href="https://poosh.com/">website</a> Poosh (think: Goop) where there are fitness workout routines, healthy food recipes, and beauty tips.</p>
