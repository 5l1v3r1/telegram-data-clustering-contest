      <p>It's on.</p>
      <p>The 'Baby Trump' political art protest balloon has followed Trump around the world, mocking him mercilessly. Baby Trump is reportedly headed to the site of this weekend's football game between University of Alabama and Louisiana State University, at which Trump is expected to be booed loudly again.</p>

      <p>From <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/469410-baby-trump-balloon-heading-to-lsu-alabama-game">The Hill:</a></p>
      <blockquote>Organizers raised more than $4,000 in about 12 hours on a GoFundMe page to bring the “VIP (very important protestor)” to an area near Bryant-Denny Stadium on the Alabama campus, which is hosting the game that President Trump is expected to attend. <br/><br/>Nic Gulas, who organized the effort, told The Hill the fundraiser had already brought in $700 more than the needed funds to transport and set up the “Baby Trump” balloon.<br/><br/>As of 11 a.m. the fundraiser had exceeded its goal by $1,045.<br/><br/>The fundraiser will remain open until 5 p.m. CST, and all additional funds will be donated to the Equal Justice Initiative, he said.</blockquote>
