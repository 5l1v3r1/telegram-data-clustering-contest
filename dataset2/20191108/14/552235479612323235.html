      <h1>Celtic tease their Christmas advert starring Neil Lennon in a tux and Bauer the elf</h1>
      <h2>Mystery surrounds what the theme of this year's advert will be...</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T14:17:25+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 14:17</time> by <a rel="author">Jennifer Russell, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/jennifer-russell/</a></address>
      <p>The wait is almost over for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> fans as the highly-anticipated <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> advert is on its way.</p>
      <p>The club teased a few pictures from the filming of the commercial - and fans are already going wild for it.</p>
      <p>The pictures show <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a> in a tux holding a clapperboard, Jullien and Ajer in matching Christmas jumpers and Bauer as a possible elf.</p>
      <p>However, mystery surrounds what the theme of this year's advert will be.</p>
      <p>Last year it was Kieran Tierney as Tiny Tim, in 2017 it was <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/brendan-rodgers">Brendan Rodgers</a> as the bus driver, and 2016 saw the now legendary Griff the elf.</p>

      <p>Releasing the first pictures on <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> , the club said: "Stars of the BIG stage in more ways than one..."</p>
      <p>And in the bottom corner of the images is the saying 'star of Lisbon, star so bright, star of Glasgow's green and white'. So a Hollywood theme with Celtic's name written in the stars could be an idea?</p>
      <p>The Hoops' festive offerings have become as much a part of the Christmas build-up as any of the big supermarket adverts in recent years - for Celtic fans anyway.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the post, fans are already 'buzzing' with the advert tease.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>One fan said: "Best 24 hours ever" and another added: "Can't wait but Griffiths better be our elf".</p>
      <p>It has been an exciting 24 hours for the club and fans after beating Lazio with a last minute away goal in Rome to enter Europa League last 32.</p>
