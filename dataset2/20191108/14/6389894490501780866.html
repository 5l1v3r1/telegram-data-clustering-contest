      <p>The youngest two were just 15 years old, while there was also a 17-year-old and a further seven aged 18 or 19. The oldest was 44 years old.</p>
      <p>Assistant Chief Constable Tim Smith said: “This was an incredibly important process and our team has been working hard to bring answers to worried families who fear their loved one may be among those whose tragic journey ended on our shores.</p>
      <p>“Our priority has been to identify the victims, to preserve the dignity of those who have died and to support the victims’ friends and families.</p>
      <p>“It remained of paramount importance to us to ensure that an individual’s next of kin were informed, and that they were given some time to absorb this tragic news before we publicly confirmed their loved one’s identity.</p>
