      <p>"(Scoring) against Osasuna was a dream, my first goal with the senior team," Fati told <i>Barca TV.</i></p>
      <p>"And then (scoring again) against Valencia at the Camp Nou, I dreamt of that moment for many nights and it became reality. You can't believe it.</p>
      <p>"I've always wanted to be here (at Barcelona). This was the idea from the start, and let's hope I can be here my whole life."</p>
