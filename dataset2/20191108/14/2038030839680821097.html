      <p>Cape Town – Brian J. Smith, known for his roles in <i>Sense8</i>, <i>Treadstone</i> and <i>World On Fire</i>, came out publicly in a cover story for <a href="https://attitude.co.uk/article/sense8-star-brian-j-smith-recalls-growing-up-gay-and-terrified-in-suburban-texas/22207/"><b>Attitude Magazine</b></a>.</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old said he was "terrified" because he didn’t fit in, growing up in suburban Texas.</p>
      <p>"Forget about any LGBTQ union or groups. There was absolutely nothing. I was completely alone. I heard all the names...</p>
      <p>"I could never be who I was,” he said.</p>
      <p>In the December issue of the magazine, he goes on to explain that he found solace in performing, and when he eventually came out to his parents, they were more accepting and understanding than he thought.</p>
      <p>If he could go back now and talk to his younger self, he said he would just hug that scared little boy and tell him it’s okay.</p>
      <p>"There weren’t enough people there to say to me: 'You don’t need to be someone different, you don’t need to change who you are'," he explained.</p>
      <p>"What that kid needed was somebody to pick him up and say, 'You’re perfect as you are, it’s OK'."</p>
      <p>Brian took to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4kHwqAHPxC/"><b>Instagram</b></a> later, sharing an image of the cover and writing, "The folks at @attitudemag reached out and I knew it was time.</p>
      <p>"Hoping there’s other people out there like me (and not like me!) who can relate. Nothin but love!"</p>
