      <p>They were announced Thursday during a ceremony at The Strong National Museum of Play in Rochester, New York. </p>
      <p>They will be on display with the 68 other inductees into the <a href="https://www.toyhalloffame.org/">Toy Hall of Fame</a> like blocks, G.I. Joe and coloring books' partner -- crayons.</p>
      <p>Other past inductees include normal toys like a yo-yo and dollhouse along with toys that aren't playthings at face value but help develop kids' imaginations like a cardboard box, inducted in 2006.</p>
      <p>As for this year's inductees, Matchbox cars hit the market in 1952. Within 8 years, they were so popular that more than 100 million cars were sold in a year, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/11/07/national-toy-hall-fame-rochester-ny-2019-museum-of-play/2519119001/">USA Today reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Magic: The Gathering was also so popular that when creator Wizards of the Coast released the card collecting game in 1993, the company couldn't keep up with the orders, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/11/07/national-toy-hall-fame-rochester-ny-2019-museum-of-play/2519119001/">according to USA Today</a>.</p>
      <p>Coloring books, which are a staple of childhood, now know no age boundaries, with coloring books now <a href="https://www.oprahmag.com/life/g28640347/best-adult-coloring-books/">being marketed to adults</a>.</p>
      <p>So, what didn't make the cut this year? Toys like Care Bears, the iconic Fisher-Price Corn Popper, Jenga and My Little Pony, <a href="https://apnews.com/fff0cfedb42b422c88cea20987aa3048">the AP reported</a>.</p>
