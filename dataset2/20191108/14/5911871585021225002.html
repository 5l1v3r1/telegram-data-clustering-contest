      <h1>Kanye West – “Follow God” Video</h1>

      <p>The big chart news about Kanye West last weekend was <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2063066/kanye-west-jesus-is-king-review/franchises/premature-evaluation/"><i>Jesus Is King</i></a> debuting atop the Billboard 200, <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2063789/kanye-west-jesus-is-king-billboard-1-album-debut/news/">tying Eminem’s record</a> for the most consecutive #1-debuting albums at nine. But in the streaming era, a massive album debut usually means lots of action on the singles chart, too. In Kanye’s case it meant <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/8542559/kanye-west-jesus-is-king-full-album-hot-100-chart">all 11 songs from <i>Jesus Is King</i></a> landing on this week’s Hot 100. The highest of those was “Follow God,” which entered at #7 to become Kanye’s 18th career top-10 hit.</p>
      <p>Perhaps in an attempt to capitalize on that lofty chart placement, today “Follow God” gets a music video. The “Follow God” lyrics include the line, “I was screaming at my dad/ He told me it ain’t Christlike.” And in keeping with that reference, the clip for the song amounts to nothing more than the self-proclaimed “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2064406/kanye-west-calls-himself-a-christian-genius-billionaire-talks-2024-presidential-run-algae-sneakers/news/">Christian genius billionaire</a>” and his father, Ray West, tooling around the Wyoming wilderness in a four-wheeler with gigantic tires. Those images are spectacularly beautiful, and the action is captivating in a way that reminds me of the “Otis” video.</p>
      <p>The visual ends with <a href="https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/1192879201176539136">a message from Kanye</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>My dad came to visit me at one of our ranches in Cody, Wyoming. He talked about his love for fishing, and how he would come here in the summers.<br/><br/>It took me 42 years to realize that my dad was my best friend.<br/><br/>He asked me, “how many acres is this?”<br/><br/>I told him 4000. He replied with these three words:<br/><br/>“A black man?”</blockquote>
