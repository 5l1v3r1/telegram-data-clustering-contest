      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 8 ― Tajikistan head coach Usmon Toshev has been following the Malaysian national team’s progress for quite a while ahead of his team’s clash with Harimau Malaya in a Tier 1 international friendly at the National Stadium in Bukit Jalil tomorrow. And he is quite impressed.</p>
      <p>Toshev, 64, a former Uzbekistan professional midfielder, said the Malaysian team under Tan Cheng Hoe have shown good progress and are able to trouble opponents with their fast playing style.</p>
      <p>He believes Malaysia, ranked 158th in the world, has a chance to book its place in the final round of the championship although they have had a difficult journey so far in the 2022 World Cup/2023 Asian Cup Joint Qualifiers campaign.</p>
      <p>“I've followed all the matches and have been in Malaysia many times...I can see the development of the Malaysian team. In the match of Malaysia and Vietnam, I could see how the development has turned the players to what they have become. From what I saw, Malaysia is a very fast team.</p>
      <p>“From what I've seen, Malaysia has a very strong team and they have the chance to get to the championship,” he told reporters at the pre-match press conference at National Stadium in Bukit Jalil here today.</p>
      <p>He is preparing Tajikistan, the world ranked 116th, for their third match of the Group F competition of the qualifying campaign, against Myanmar on Nov 14 after having defeated higher-ranked Kyrgyzstan 1-0 and Mongolia 1-0.</p>
      <p>“It is a very important game for us and I expect an interesting match tomorrow.</p>
      <p>“Before we take on Myanmar I want to see the condition of our players and the way they play. I want them to get used to the weather as the condition is quite the same here with Myanmar.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Tajikistan captain Nazarov Akhtam is looking forward to tomorrow's match as he wants to see the progress of his team before the tie against Myanmar in Mandalay.</p>
      <p>“We've been preparing very well and working hard in training to put up a good display for the fans in upcoming matches. I also want to see the strong and weak sides of my team,” he said. ― Bernama</p>
