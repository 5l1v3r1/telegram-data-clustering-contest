      <p>A thief who ordered his <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/pets">Staffordshire bull terrier</a> to maul three people including a police officer during a robbery has been <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/courts">jailed</a> for 10 months.</p>
      <p>Stephen McCafferty, 22, yelled at pet dog Mia to attack two terrified members of the public before turning its attention to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/police-scotland">PC Ross Meldrum</a> during a 20 minute rampage.</p>
      <p>McCafferty robbed a branch of Costcutters in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hamilton">Hamilton</a> , Lanarkshire, and assaulted staff member Fiona Sutherland as she tried to throw him out after he stole scratchcards and wine.</p>

      <p>He then set the dog on Dariuz Gorczynski outside a primary school after stealing a mobile phone from a car.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/police-scotland">Police</a> were called and a chase saw McCafferty cornered but he screamed at the dog to attack PC Meldrum and it mauled his hand.</p>
      <p>Officers used batons to contain McCafferty and arrest him.</p>
      <p>McCafferty, of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/blantyre">Blantyre,</a> Lanarkshire, appeared at the Hamilton Sheriff Court and was jailed after admitting robbery and assault in June this year.</p>
      <p>Describing the attack on PC Meldrum, depute fiscal Scott King said: "Police were advised of what was going on and began searching the area to find the accused and saw him outside the primary school.</p>
      <p>"He began to run followed by his dog and was eventually traced in a dead end where he began repeatedly to instruct his dog to get them shouting ' get them Mia'.</p>
      <p>"Police drew their batons because of the dog but it ran towards PC Meldrum and bit him on the left hand.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"The accused's aggressive behaviour required them to strike him with a baton and apply straps before carrying him to a nearby police van."</p>
      <p>Those who had been bitten were taken to hospital and given tetanus injections. <br/>Andy Iles, defending, said: "He is realistic about the outcome of this process and how serious this matter is.</p>
      <p>"This incident was a combination of two factors, two decades in the making with his upbringing and an addiction to street valium.</p>
      <p>"He has shown adequate and genuine remorse for his behaviour and was shocked at how he had acted."</p>
      <p>Sheriff Thomas Millar said: "You heard the narration and accept it was quite a horrendous course of conduct which has to be met with a period of custody."</p>
      <p>Mia is now being cared for by a family member.</p>
