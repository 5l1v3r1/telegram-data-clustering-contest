      <p>OnePlus launched the OnePlus 7, 7 Pro and 7 Pro 5G back in May 2019, and all three phones are now available to buy.</p>
      <p>Though since supplanted by the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/smartphones/oneplus-7t-3702822/">OnePlus 7T</a>, the OnePlus 7 is still worth considering if you can find it, especially since it's now cheaper than ever. The 7 Pro, more excitingly, features a 6.67in 90Hz Fluid AMOLED display and a pop-up selfie camera. This removes the notch and maximises screen space. The 7 Pro also features a triple-lens rear camera. </p>

        <h4>OnePlus 7 trade-in deals</h4>
        <p>OnePlus offers discount on new phones if you trade-in an older model too - whether that's a previous OnePlus or a phone from another company.</p>
        <p>If you own a OnePlus 6T, you can trade that in too for a value up to £190, while a OnePlus 6 could get you £170, with even more available from some rival flagships. <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=10937&amp;awinaffid=254429&amp;clickref=06-3696838-11-0000000&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Fuk%2Ftrade-in%23address%2Fedit">See OnePlus's trade-in program</a> to see how much your old device is worth.</p>
        <h4>John Lewis trade-in deal</h4>
        <p>John Lewis also has a trade-in promotion now where you can get up to £330 off the OnePlus 7 Pro when you trade in your old phone (iPhone, Samsung, Google or OnePlus) or Apple Watch. For the full £330 you would have to trade in a fully working unlocked iPhone 8 Plus (256GB), but other models can still save you a pretty penny. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3696838-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fbuying-advice%2Fmobile-phone%2Fbest-oneplus-7-pro-5g-deals-3696838%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fjlp.square1tradein.co.uk%2F">See how much your phone is worth over at Square1</a>.</p>
