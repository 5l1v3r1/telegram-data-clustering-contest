      <h1>Second Cup to get new corporate name as it moves to diversify beyond coffee</h1>

      <p>MISSISSAUGA, Ont. -- The Second Cup Ltd. intends to change its name to Aegis Brands Inc. as part of a plan to diversify beyond coffee shops.</p>
      <p>The Toronto-area company says the name change is subject to approvals from shareholders and the Toronto Stock Exchange, where its shares are listed.</p>
      <p>Steven Pelton, who has been Second Cup's president and CEO since May, will be chief executive of Aegis Brands.</p>
      <p>Aegis will own and operate the existing Second Cup Coffee Co. as one of a portfolio of brands.</p>
      <p>The company says it's also seeking acquisitions in the foodservice, coffee and cannabis sectors.</p>
      <p>The name change was announced as Second Cup reported a third-quarter loss as sales at its cafes fell from the same time last year.</p>
      <p>The corporation posted a $762,000 net loss and a $62,000 adjusted net loss with about $6.7 million of revenue. System sales were $32.9 million and same-store sales, a key metric for retailers, fell 2.9 per cent.</p>
      <p>Net loss was four cents per share and adjusted net loss per share was insignificant.</p>
      <p>The adjusted loss excluded a reduction in the value of Second Cup's investment in National Access Cannabis warrants.</p>
      <p>A year earlier, Second Cup had a $766,000 net profit, and $432,000 adjusted net profit with about $5.9 million of revenue and $35.7 million of system sales from its cafes.</p>
