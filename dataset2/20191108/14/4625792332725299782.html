      <h1>Megyn Kelly teases interview with ABC News-Epstein whistleblower</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T14:05:35+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 14:05</time> by <a rel="author">Mike Brest</a></address>
      <p>Journalist Megyn Kelly teased an interview with the woman who leaked a video of an ABC News reporter discussing how the network shut down her story about a Jeffrey Epstein accuser.</p>
      <p>Kelly, who is reentering the limelight after being fired from NBC last year, posted a short clip on Instagram Friday morning, saying she would be posting the interview later in the day.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, Project Veritas released a <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/i-had-it-all-abc-host-claims-network-squashed-epstein-story-three-years-ago-in-leaked-video">video</a> of Amy Robach discussing the information she received years earlier from Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre on a hot mic. The reporter can be heard expressing her frustration surrounding ABC News's refusal to air the interview and claimed that the network made the decision after receiving threats from Buckingham Palace after they had found out Prince Andrew was implicated in the story. She also alleged that Epstein, the convicted sex offender who was <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/jeffrey-epstein-commits-suicide">found dead in his jail cell</a> in August, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/jeffrey-epstein-commits-suicide">may have been murdered</a>.</p>

      <p>"It was unbelievable what we had. Clinton, we had everything," she stated. "I tried for three years to get it on to no avail. And now it's all coming out, and it's like these new revelations, and I freaking had all of it."</p>
      <p>The woman who obtained the video of Robach is no longer an employee of ABC News. Rather, she had a job at CBS News at the time of the video's publication. It's not clear if the woman who obtained the video provided it to Project Veritas or if she gave it to someone who did; however, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/cbs-news-fires-staffer-who-leaked-abc-news-video-about-epstein-cover-up-report">that did not stop CBS from firing her</a>.</p>
