      <p>PC players are finally getting their chance at exploring the untamed American west in Red Dead Redemption 2, but it hasn't been without its problems. Some players are <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/red-dead-redemption-2-pc-bugs-crashes-fixes/">still having trouble</a> getting Rockstar's epic cowboy adventure to run on their PCs. Fear not, though: While you wait for updates, you can still head out west in American Truck Simulator, which is free to try on Steam this weekend.</p>
      <p>The free weekend marks the release of the latest DLC for American Truck Simulator, the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/american-truck-simulators-next-expansion-goes-to-utah/">state of Utah</a>. This adds 3,500 miles of road that stretch from Salt Lake City to Moab, affording views of Utah's stunning and often forbidding landscapes. SCS Software says it's developed a new way to create rock formations and other natural terrain features, and Utah's Monument Valley and Virgin River Canyon are perfect places showcase the new tech.</p>
      <p>If you decide to buy the game, American Truck Simulator is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/270880/American_Truck_Simulator/">75 percent off this weekend</a>.
