      <p>Best Buy has the Sony WH-1000XM3 wireless, noise cancelling headphones <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">on sale</a> right now for just $279.</p>
      <p>This is the lowest that these have ever been, since being released late last year. These normally run for around $349, and only dropped down to $299 for Black Friday last year. Now it has dropped lower before, but for a used or refurbished model, which was just $269. So this is a really good deal.</p>
      <p>The Sony WH-1000XM3 are said to be the best pair of headphones that money can buy right now. And having owned a pair myself, I can't disagree. These headphones are pretty amazing. And the pair that they replaced were already pretty amazing themself.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>With the Sony WH-1000XM3 you are getting a pair of wireless headphones, which is great since most smartphones are now ditching the headphone jack. These headphones also have active noise cancellation and ambient sound. Active Noise Cancellation is really good for taking on a plane or using in the gym, as you can really immerse yourself in your music.</p>
      <p>Now with Ambient Sound, you can let some of that sound back in. This is good if you are walking down the street, as you're going to want to be able to hear that there are cars coming. Or when you're flying, as you'll want to be able to hear the announcements that the flight attendants are making. It's a feature that most people don't think they need, but once they use it, they figure out that they do need it.</p>
      <p>Sound quality on the Sony WH-1000XM3's are exactly what you'd expect from Sony â€“ which is also a music label. The bass is pretty deep, but it's not overpowering the mids and highs. Everything sounds really good and crisp. These can also get very loud, without distorting your music. That's something that not every pair of headphones can do.</p>

      <p>Then there's the battery life. It's honestly, pretty good. It will last you around 30 hours of continuous playback. Now that is with active noise cancellation and Ambient Sound on. So if you need a bit more juice, turn those off, and you'll get closer to 40 hours of continuous playback. Now that is pretty impressive.</p>
      <p>And there is also the Google Assistant built-in, so you can hear your text messages, ask about the weather, and more.</p>
