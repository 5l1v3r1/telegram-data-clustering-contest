      <h2>Lowe was sent-off playing for Bury against Argyle at Home Park in January 2018</h2>

      <p>Plymouth Argyle manager Ryan Lowe has insisted he has ‘no hard feelings’ towards Bolton Wanderers goalkeeper Remi Matthews over a red card incident at Home Park in 2018.</p>
      <p>Lowe was playing for Bury at the time, near the end of his playing career, when he was sent-off for a challenge on Matthews, who was on loan to the Pilgrims from Norwich City.</p>
      <p>Now, nearly two years on, Lowe is the manager of Argyle, who are away to Matthews and his Bolton team-mates in the FA Cup first round tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Lowe was reminded of the incident at his pre-match media call ahead of the trip to the University of Bolton Stadium and said with a laugh: “I will give him a slight dig when I walk out the tunnel!”</p>
      <p>He added: “It was the worst journey of my life. Six hours on the way home and no-one spoke to me.”</p>
      <p>Lowe was a first half substitute for bottom-of-the-table Bury when they played Argyle in a League One game on January 6, 2018, which they lost 3-0.</p>
      <p>He was sent-off in the 60 minute after he chased after a through ball into the Pilgrims’ penalty area.</p>
      <p>Matthews dived forward to get the ball but referee Trevor Kettle decided that Lowe’s challenge on the ‘keeper warranted his dismissal.</p>
      <p>Derek Adams, who was Argyle manager, described it as ‘a clear red card’.</p>
      <p>To this day, Lowe insists ‘I didn’t touch him’ but he said: “It’s football. I don’t carry things on. I don’t dwell on things.</p>
      <p>“He (Matthews) played the game and I wish some of my players would play the game sometimes when they are being whacked.</p>
      <p>“Look, it is what it is. I have got no hard feelings against him at all.”</p>
      <p>Matthews has made a total of 15 starts for Bolton this season and his recent performances have earned praise from manager Keith Hill.</p>
