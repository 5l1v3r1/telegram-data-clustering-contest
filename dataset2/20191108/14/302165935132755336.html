      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 8 ― National men's doubles pair Aaron Chia-Soh Wooi Yik continued their fiery form by stunning world champions Muhammad Ahsan-Hendra Setiawan of Indonesia today to book their place in the last four of the China Open Badminton Tournament in Fuzhou, China.</p>
      <p>The unseeded pair, who ousted another top Indonesian pair, world number five Fajar Alfian-Muhammad Rian Ardianto in the second round yesterday, won 21-13, 22-20 against the second seeded pair in the quarter-finals match held at Haixia Sports Olympic Center, according to the Badminton World Federation (BWF) <a href="http://www.bwfbadminton.com/">website</a>.</p>
      <p>The victory is certainly a major boost for Chia and Soh heading into the 2019 Philippines SEA Games at the end of this month, considering it is their first victory against the veteran pair.</p>
      <p>National mixed doubles pair Goh Soon Huat-Shevon Jemie Lai are also through to the semi-finals after pulling off a 21-13, 21-18 win over world number five Dechapol Puavaranukroh-Sapsiree Taerattanachai of Thailand in another quarter-finals match.</p>
      <p>Malaysian professional mixed doubles pair, sixth seeded Chan Peng Soon-Goh Liu Ying, on the other hand, lost to world number two pair Wang Yilyu-Huang Dongping of China 21-18, 13-21, 22-24.</p>
      <p>The country's challenge in women's doubles fizzled out after Chow Mei Kuan-Lee Meng Yean lost 15-21, 14-21 to world number one pair Yuki Fukushima-Sayaka Hirota of Japan. ― Bernama</p>
