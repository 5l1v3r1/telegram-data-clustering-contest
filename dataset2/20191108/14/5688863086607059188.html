        <b>Yusuf Pathan has always been hailed as a hard hitting all rounder who can bowl but his fielding skills have never been in the limelight. In a Syed Mustak Ali match between Goa and Baroda, Pathan plucked a blinder out of midair to dismiss Goa skipper Darshan Misal while he earned a duck with his bat.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The former Indian all-rounder <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/yusuf_pathan">Yusuf Pathan</a> who is renowned to be a hard hitter is currently in the limelight for a brilliant piece of fielding. In a Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy match between Goa and Baroda, which Baroda lost by 4 wickets, Pathan having earned a duck with the bat tried to make it up with his fielding. </p>
      <p>Towards the closing moments of Goa’s chase, which was a quite comfortable one, Pathan held on to a blinder at short cover to dismiss Goa skipper Darshan Misal, who played an impressive cameo of 27 off just 18 balls. Pathan was overwhelmed with his effort and was seen roaring with joy after the catch.</p>
      <p>Sharing the video of Pathan’s brilliant catch, his younger brother <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/irfan_pathan">Irfan Pathan</a> wrote, “Is it a bird ? No this is @yusuf_pathan Great catch today lala. All ur hard work in pre-season is paying off now.”</p>
      <p>Although the catch didn't affect the outcome of the match, as Goa was only eight runs away from victory, it is evident of players’ dedication and the ever-rising standard of India’s domestic circuit.</p>
