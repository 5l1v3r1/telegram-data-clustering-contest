      <h1>Chase Young of Ohio State Won’t Play Over N.C.A.A. ‘Issue’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T14:49:14+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 14:49</time> by <a rel="author">Victor Mather</a></address>
      <p>Defensive end Chase Young, the best player on one of the best teams in college football, Ohio State, will not play this weekend as the university investigates possible N.C.A.A. violations.</p>
      <p>Young will sit “due to a possible N.C.A.A. issue from 2018 that the Department of Athletics is looking into,” the school said in a statement on Friday.</p>
      <p>Young, a junior, released his own statement on Twitter, suggesting the violation had to do with a loan.</p>
      <p>“I made a mistake last year by accepting a loan from a family friend I’ve known since the summer before my freshman year at OSU,” Young wrote. “I repaid it in full last summer and I’m working with the University and NCAA to get back on the field as soon as possible.”</p>
      <p>The school did not provide more details about the issue, and the N.C.A.A. declined to comment. It was not immediately clear whether Young’s suspension would continue after this weekend.</p>
      <p>Ohio State is 8-0 and emerged as the No. 1 team in the initial College Football Playoff rankings this week. Their perfect record includes victories over strong Michigan State and Wisconsin teams.</p>
      <p>Ohio State meets Maryland on Saturday, a game in which the Buckeyes are favored by 43 points. After playing another weak team, Rutgers, on Nov. 16, O.S.U. faces a real test against Penn State on Nov. 23. Penn State was ranked No. 4 by the initial rankings, ahead of Clemson, the reigning champion.</p>
      <p>Ohio State concludes its regular season against archrival Michigan on Nov. 30.</p>
      <p>Young has 15½ tackles for a loss on the season and 13½ sacks, which leads the country. A junior, he is widely expected to be a top three N.F.L. draft choice after the season. He also has been talked up as a Heisman Trophy candidate, a rare accolade for a defensive player (the award often goes to quarterbacks).</p>
      <p>At 6-foot-6 and 270-pounds, Young has become known as the Predator for his fearsome pass rushing.</p>
