      <p>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) - A Virginia man has been sentenced to 6.5 years in prison for cyberstalking his ex-girlfriends and sending nude photos of them to their families, friends and even a church.</p>
      <p>The Richmond-<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/times-dispatch/">Times Dispatch</a> reports 23-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/satyasurya-sahas-thumma/">Satyasurya Sahas Thumma</a> was sentenced Thursday on charges including aggravated identity theft. He pleaded guilty in July.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/satyasurya-sahas-thumma/">Thumma</a> “manipulated, tormented and terrorized” the two women and their families for a year until his arrest in April 2019.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Brian R. Hood said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/satyasurya-sahas-thumma/">Thumma</a> was on a “campaign to ruin” them for leaving him. He shared photos from anonymous accounts and later broke into one women’s Twitter account to share the images. He demanded $25,000 worth of bitcoin from the other woman.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/satyasurya-sahas-thumma/">Thumma</a> said in court that he feels “really bad for what I did.”</p>
