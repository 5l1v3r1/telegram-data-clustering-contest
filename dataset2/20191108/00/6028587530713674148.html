      <p><b>Topline</b>: Excerpts from a new, “unprecedented” tell-all book about President Donald Trump written by an anonymous senior government official have been revealed, but critics suggest that the book doesn’t actually reveal much that is new.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ominously titled <i>A Warning</i>, the 259-page book describes a chaotic Trump navigating the White House as a “12-year-old boy in an air traffic control tower pushing the buttons of government indiscriminately,” the <i>Washington Post </i><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/book-by-anonymous-describes-trump-as-cruel-inept-and-a-danger-to-the-nation/2019/11/07/b6b6c6f2-0150-11ea-8bab-0fc209e065a8_story.html">reports</a>. </li>
        <li>The author describes instances of the president making racist and misogynistic remarks in private, including attempting to mock people crossing the southern border in a Hispanic accent and making derogatory remarks about women’s appearances.</li>
        <li>The book points to his volatility, and urges that Trump not be reelected. It also claims that Trump said it would be “stupid to pick a fight” with Saudi Arabia over the death of <i>Washington Post</i> journalist Jamal Khashoggi.</li>
        <li>Trump’s Twitter rants would often leave officials in a “full blown panic,” according to the author. “It’s like showing up at the nursing home at daybreak to find your elderly uncle running pantsless across the courtyard and cursing loudly, ... only your uncle probably wouldn’t do it every single day, his words aren’t broadcast to the public, and he doesn’t have to lead the US government once he puts his pants on,” they write.</li>
        <li><i>A Warning </i>comes from the anonymous author of a <i>New York Times</i> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/opinion/trump-white-house-anonymous-resistance.html">op-ed last year</a>, in which they said they were among the “many senior officials” in the administration “working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations.”</li>
        <li>The author of the book said they did not want to identify themselves because “this debate is not about me. It is about how we want the presidency to reflect our country, and that is where the discussion should center.” However, they added that they may reveal their identity in due course.</li>
        <li>A portion of the royalties will be donated to nonprofits “focused on government accountability,” the <i>New York Times</i> reported. The book will be released on November 19.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Chief critic</b>: White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham called out the author as a coward and said the book was “nothing but lies” and should be covered by journalists as a “work of fiction.”</p>
      <p><b>Additional fact</b>: A number of books have been released by writers and disgruntled former Trump staffers about the chaotic administration, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Michael Wolff’s <b><i>Fire and Fury</i></b><i>, </i>an exposé of the White House that became a New York Time No. 1 bestseller.</li>
        <li><b><i>Unhinged</i></b>, by Omarosa Manigault Newman, who wrote that Trump asked to be sworn in on his own book, <i>The Art of the Deal.</i></li>
        <li><b><i>Team of Vipers</i></b><i>, </i>by former communications aide Cliff Sims, which was highly critical of then-White House press secretary Sarah Sanders.</li>
        <li><b><i>The Briefing</i></b>, by ex-White House communications director Sean Spicer, who writes of the routine use of burner phones in the White House to avoid leaks being traced.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Further reading</b>: Reviewing the book, Jennifer Szalai <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/books/review/a-warning-anonymous-book-review-trump.html">writes</a> in the <i>New York Times</i>: “Anonymous has seen disturbing things. Anonymous has heard disturbing things. You, the reader, will already recognize most of what Anonymous has seen and heard as revealed in this book if you have been paying any attention to the news. Did you know that the president isn’t much of a reader? That he’s inordinately fond of autocrats? That ‘he stumbles, slurs, gets confused, is easily irritated, and has trouble synthesizing information’?”</p>
