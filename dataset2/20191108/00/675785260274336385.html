      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/westlife-heading-massive-world-tour-18995224">A source close to the Irish boyband revealed to the Mirror that the boys were planning a huge follow up tour</a> off the back of their sell out Twenty Two shows earlier this year.</p>
      <p>At the time the source close to the Irish boyband told us: "Westlife’s comeback tour has been a remarkable success and interest in their new music has been better than the band ever imagined, so plans are well underway for what comes after the album release in November.</p>
      <p>"There will also be even more new music with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/ed-sheeran">Ed Sheeran</a> . Westlife are popular again. The Twenty Tour sold 700,000 tickets. There is a lot more to come from them, they’re in it for the longterm now."</p>
