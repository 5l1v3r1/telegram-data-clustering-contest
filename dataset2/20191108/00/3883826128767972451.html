        <b>A giant Hollywood-style sign installed to mark the National Eisteddfod in Llanrwst will be taken down next week.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Overlooking the Conwy Valley, the sign has been popular with residents and there are now calls for it to be re-erected on a permanent basis.</p>
      <p>Councillor Aaron Wynne said the sign had been "fantastic" for the area.</p>
      <p>Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said the structure's permit had "sadly expired" and would be taken down on Monday.</p>
      <p>Iwan Glyn Williams, who was part of the team that organised installing the sign, said it has been visited more than a million times since July.</p>
      <p>"It's been great to see it on the hill since July, and I've lost count of the number of positive comments about it," he said.</p>

      <p>Nicola Maysmor, Senior Officer Land Management at NRW said: "The Hollywood-style Llanrwst sign installed for the Eisteddfod has been a huge success and we were thrilled to see it attract so much attention and visitors to the forest.</p>
      <p>"While it has been extremely popular, the structure's permit has sadly expired.</p>
      <p>"However, we are aware of how fond local residents and visitors are of the sign and future discussions will take place on the possibility of it becoming a permanent feature in Gwydir Forest."</p>
      <p>Mr Wynne said: "I absolutely agree that it would be great to keep the sign in place, although I'm aware that this version was designed as a temporary structure so we'll be discussing with Natural Resource Wales and the National Park to see what's possible in the future.</p>

      <p>"Locals have adopted the sign and asked for it to stay."</p>
      <p>But he said if the sign was to stay, it would need to be rebuilt with "more robust materials".</p>

      <p>The Snowdonia National Park Authority said planning permission was valid "until the last day of the year" and it had not "received a further request for planning permission".</p>
      <p>"The authority deals with every application on an individual basis," a spokesman said.</p>
