      <p>FRISCO, Texas (AP) - Dallas Cowboys linebacker <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/leighton-vander-esch/">Leighton Vander Esch</a> is set to return against Minnesota after the second-year player missed the first game of his career with a neck injury.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/leighton-vander-esch/">Vander Esch</a> sustained the injury against Philadelphia before the open week and missed the first game back against the New York Giants on Monday night. The 2018 first-round pick was limited in practice all week but didn’t have a designation for game status, meaning <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/leighton-vander-esch/">Vander Esch</a> is expected to play.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/leighton-vander-esch/">Vander Esch</a> is second to linebacker Jaylon Smith in tackles, according to the team stats.</p>
      <p>Receiver Amari Cooper is listed as questionable with a knee injury. Cooper left the 37-18 victory over the Giants after aggravating an injury sustained in practice before the game. He returned to catch a 45-yard touchdown. Cooper says he expects to play.</p>
