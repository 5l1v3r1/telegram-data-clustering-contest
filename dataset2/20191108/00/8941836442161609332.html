      <p>DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) - Toni Kroos leads a group of Germany players returning from injury ahead of next week’s European Championship qualifying matches.</p>
      <p>The Real Madrid midfielder is in line to make his 95th international appearance after a muscle tear ruled him out of the friendly draw with Argentina and qualifying win over Estonia in September.</p>
      <p>Also back from injury are Matthias Ginter, Leon Goretzka, Jonas Hector and Nico Schulz.</p>
      <p>Germany is second in Group C. It plays Belarus on Nov. 16 and third-place Northern Ireland three days later.</p>
      <p>Avoiding defeat against Northern Ireland should be enough for Germany to take one of the two qualifying spots.</p>

      <p>Emre Can was also selected even though he is suspended for the Belarus game because of a red card against Estonia.</p>
