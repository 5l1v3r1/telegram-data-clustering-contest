      <p>Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray on Friday slammed ally BJP for trying 'to prove him a liar', claiming that it had agreed to share the chief</p>
      <p>minister's post in Maharashtra during his talks with Amit Shah.</p>
      <p>He would fulfill the promise made to his father, late Sena founder Bal Thackeray, to install a Shiv Sena chief minister in the state, and does not need Devendra Fadnavis or Shah for this, Uddhav Thackeray said.</p>
      <p>Thackeray addressed the media soon after Chief Minister Fadnavis handed over his resignation to Maharashtra Governor, and was asked to continue as caretaker CM.</p>

      <p>Reacting strongly to Fadnavis's claim that there had been no agreement on sharing the chief minister's post for two-and-half years, Thackeray again and again said that he was hurt that the BJP tried to portray him as a liar.</p>
      <p>He did not hold talks with the BJP after the Assembly poll results came in on October 24 as he could not tolerate being called a liar, he said.</p>
      <p>The Sena chief also denied Fadnavis's claim that Sena leaders targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p>
      <p>He did not attack Modi but criticised the NDA government from time to time over policies, Thackeray said.</p>
      <p>There has been no headway in government formation in the state even a fortnight after Assembly poll results were announced on October 24.</p>
      <p>The BJP and Shiv Sena are locked in a tussle over the chief minister's post, resulting in a stalemate despite the poll results giving the saffron alliance a combined seat strength of 161, way past the 145 majority mark in the 288- member House.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
