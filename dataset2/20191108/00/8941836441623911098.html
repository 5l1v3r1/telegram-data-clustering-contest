      <p>LOS ANGELES (AP) - Three Saudi nationals were charged in Southern California with violating federal export laws by buying $100,000 worth of gun parts in the U.S. while on student visas and smuggling them to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/saudi-arabia/">Saudi Arabia</a>, federal prosecutors said Wednesday.</p>
      <p>An indictment returned this week charges Hatim Humeed Alsufyani, 36, and Mosab Alzahrani, 27, with conspiracy and knowingly exporting weapons parts without a license, the U.S. Department of Justice said.</p>
      <p>A separate indictment charges Abdulwahab Mohammed A. Alabdulwahab, 30, with similar counts, as well as smuggling.</p>
      <p>All three are believed to be in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/saudi-arabia/">Saudi Arabia</a> and could not be reached for comment.</p>
      <p>Alsufyani and Alzahrani allegedly conspired between 2014 and 2018 to smuggle firearms parts from the U.S. to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/saudi-arabia/">Saudi Arabia</a> by falsely identifying rifle barrels, rifle triggers and other items as “shower curtain rods” or “car parts,” according to a news release.</p>

      <p>On Dec. 10, 2016, Alzahrani attempted to board a flight from Los Angeles to Riyadh with 30 firearms parts concealed in his checked luggage, the indictment alleges.</p>
      <p>Alzahrani was allowed to leave the country after being found with weapons parts, spokesman Thom Mrozek said. Mrozek wasn’t sure if he was allowed to leave that day or at a later date.</p>
      <p>Between 2015 and 2018, Alabdulwahab contacted U.S.-based firearms parts retailers to purchase firearms parts for the purpose of illegally exporting those components to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/saudi-arabia/">Saudi Arabia</a>, court papers said.</p>

        <p>Mrozek said the timing of the indictments has nothing to do with a separate case in Northern California alleging the Saudi government recruited Twitter employees to gather confidential information on thousands of accounts that included prominent opponents.</p>
