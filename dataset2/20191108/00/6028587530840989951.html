      <p>Jeff Lynne’s ELO (or simply ELO, or Electric Light Orchestra, for those who were there from the beginning) is back at No. 1 on the U.K. albums chart with their latest album <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/jeff-lynnes-elo-from-out-of-nowhere/1479921625"><i>From Out of Nowhere</i></a>, which debuts atop the list...though it’s arrival is met with some controversy.The title is the band’s fourth chart-topper in their home country. They first summited the list in 1979 with <i>Discover</i>, and they repeated that success two years later with their follow-up, <i>Time</i>. In an incredible show of sustained popularity (and how one major festival appearance can change everything in an instant), the group’s greatest hits compilation <i>All Over the World - The Very Best Of</i> shot to No. 1 <a href="https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/jeff-lynne-s-elo-score-their-first-number-1-album-in-35-years-im-totally-amazed-__15849/">three years ago</a>. That release had already been out for over a decade, but a headlining spot at Glastonbury convinced enough people to rush to buy the project, and it made waves not long after.</p>
      <p><i>From Out of Nowhere</i> is ELO’s eleventh top 10 album in the nation.</p>
      <p>Early this frame, the <i>Official Charts Company</i> reported that another new release was headed straight to the top of the ranking and that it wasn’t even a close race. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BBC-Children-Need-Covered-Various/dp/B07T4N5BZ2/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=bbc+children+in+need&amp;qid=1573199927&amp;sr=8-1"><i>BBC Children in Need: Got It Covered</i></a>, a collection of covers of popular songs by famous actors (such as Olivia Colman, David Tennant and Helena Bonham Carter) recorded and sold to raise money to benefit children’s causes, was <a href="https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/bbc-children-in-need-album-got-it-covered-heading-for-number-1-on-the-uks-official-albums-chart__27659/">predicted</a> to win the week, but just a day ago, the chart compilers <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-50337631">changed their thinking</a>, upsetting many in the process.</p>
      <p>Apparently, <i>BBC Children in Need: Got It Covered</i> counts as a compilation by various artists, not a proper album, so it isn’t eligible for the main chart (according to U.K. rules). The set may have been the best-performing title this week, but it was robbed of a chance to rule in proper fashion, though it was still a major success when it comes to bringing in much-needed funds. </p>
