      <p><b>Volkswagen</b> has sold out of the compact<b> Caddy Beach camper</b> introduced last year, and the model <b>won't be renewed for 2020</b>.</p>
      <p>Just <b>120 examples</b> of the camper van made it to Australia, <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/668044/volkswagen-caddy-beach-price/">priced from <b>$46,990 drive-away</b></a>, featuring a fold-out bed, walk-through tent, two folding camp chairs, blockout curtains, and plenty of interior storage for weekends away.</p>
      <p>When not on campsite duty, the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/volkswagen-caddy-beach/">Caddy Beach</a> converts into a five-seat people carrier.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/volkswagen/">Volkswagen Australia</a> says the decision to end the camper's run is "a <a href="https://www.carsguide.com.au/car-news/vw-caddy-beach-axed-from-australia-76864">rationalisation of the range</a>".</p>
      <p>"I don’t think anyone could accuse the Beach of being anything other than a niche model," a spokesperson told <i>CarAdvice</i>.</p>
      <p>"We brought in a few examples of it in the last model year, but it’s had its run."</p>

      <p>Moving forward, Volkswagen Australia will focus on <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/781038/2020-volkswagen-california-t6-1-revealed/">the T6.1 California camper</a> revealed in August. As with the wider Multivan and Caravelle range, the updated California gets a more modern look on the outside, more technology on the inside, and a revised range of front- and all-wheel drive powertrains.</p>
      <p>Although the California hasn't been confirmed for Australia, local Volkswagen representatives have made it clear the company wants it.</p>
      <p>"We still see the California as being a strong opportunity, which is why we’re working hard on introducing it as part of the T6.1 rollout," the Volkswagen Australia spokesperson said.</p>
