      <h1>Researchers Have Developed A Virus That Can Kill All Known Cancer Types</h1>

      <p><b>An Australian company</b> has developed a type of virus that can supposedly cure all known cancer types, including triple negative breast cancer, melanoma, lung cancer, bladder, gastric and bowel cancer. <br/><b>As reported by</b> <i><a href="https://www.news.com.au/national/human-trials-to-begin-next-year-using-a-virus-to-kill-cancer/news-story/f38cd02d2652a2ff3ae90a51b4893423?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">News.com.au</a></i>, the virus was engineered by US cancer expert Professor Yuman Fong, who explained that evidence suggesting viruses could terminate cancer existed as early as the 1900s, when people who received “vaccination for rabies” also had their cancer symptoms “disappear.” <br/><b>However, Fong did</b> have the concern that the virus strong enough to kill cancer might also pose fatal consequences for men. He explained that there would be “human trials” conducted early next year, with the virus being injected into patients’ tumors and then mulitplying itself until the tumors explode and die. <br/><a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <br/><b>While the virus</b> may offer answers for future medical development, Cancer Council chief professor Sanchia Aranda said that its workings can only truly be comprehended when it is tested on humans. As for now, it is unclear whether the immune system would build a defense to kill the virus before it can get rid of cancer, and whether there would be repercussions to a person’s health. <br/><b>This is due</b> to the fact that cancer cells are “true Darwinians” and mutate often for survival, so there is a possibility of them resisting the virus like how they fight against chemotherapy and immunotherapy.</p>
