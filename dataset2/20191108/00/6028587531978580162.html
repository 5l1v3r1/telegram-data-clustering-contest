      <p><b>Qorvo (NASDAQ: QRVO)</b>, a maker of radio-frequency semiconductor components, saw its stock price jump by over 20% on Friday. The rally was driven by stronger than expected Q2 FY’20 results (FY ends March), with adjusted EPS coming in at $1.52, compared to a consensus of $1.30 and also due to a strong forecast for the December quarter (revenue of $840 million to $860 million, compared to consensus of around $760 million). While the company is benefiting from growing 5G handset volumes, it also indicated that it saw new design wins with a major Korean smartphone maker (likely Samsung) and four Chinese phone makers. Separately, Qorvo also authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program. Below, we take a look at how the company has fared in recent years and what lies ahead.View our interactive dashboard analysis on <a href="https://dashboards.trefis.com/no-login-required/Asr0isrW/Why-Did-Qorvo-Stock-Jump-20-On-Friday-EID-040?fromforbesandarticle=trefis191106"><b>Why Did Qorvo Stock Jump 20% On Friday?</b></a></p>
