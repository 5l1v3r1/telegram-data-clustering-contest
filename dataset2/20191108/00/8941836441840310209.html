      <p>WARREN, Mich. (AP) - Three football players at a Catholic high school in suburban Detroit should face charges after an investigation found some players were subjected to hazing involving a broomstick, police said Friday.</p>
      <p>The investigation began last week after all-boys De La Salle Collegiate said it would forfeit a playoff game and end the football season due to hazing incidents. The school had won two consecutive state championships.</p>
      <p>“There was a broom used but there was no (physical) penetration. … They held the individual down. That’s as far as I’ll go,” said Bill Dwyer, the police commissioner in Warren.</p>
      <p>Police recommended charges against a pair of 16-year-old boys and an 18-year-old who was 17 at the time the hazing is alleged to have happened. But a few hours later, the Macomb County prosecutor said the victim in the case doesn’t want to pursue charges and has declined to speak to investigators.</p>
      <p>Eric Smith also said his office will hand the case to another prosecutor because of a conflict of interest involving a staff member.</p>

      <p>Earlier Friday, Dwyer said he believes there are “many victims.” He also said the parents of 15 boys wouldn’t allow their sons to be interviewed. Some have attorneys.</p>
      <p>“School officials cooperated even though it was very disturbing to them and something that’s embarrassing to the school,” Dwyer said.</p>
      <p>Three students have been suspended. De La Salle parent Joe Hallman, who has a son on the team, said the three should be held accountable.</p>

        <p>“It’s not a culture of the school. It’s not a culture of the football team,” Hallman told WXYZ-TV.</p>
