      <h1>Alphabet’s Stock Is Ready To Soar</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T00:00:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Michael Kramer</a></address>
      <p><i>Michael Kramer and the clients of Mott Capital own GOOGL</i>Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), the parent of the search engine Google, closed at an all-time high on November 7. The big news, shares broke out of a roughly 18-month period of consolidation, which may result in the stock soaring in the months ahead. Even from a valuation perspective the equity is historically cheap and could see significant multiple expansion in the months ahead.</p>
      <p>Shares fell initially after the company reported third quarter results at the end October on an apparent miss on the bottom-line, while reporting better than expected revenue. When digging deeper the earnings miss was due to a non-operating item on the income statement. The results were better than they appeared, and the operating income was stronger than the previous year.</p>
      <h3>Breaking Out</h3>
      <p>Alphabet closed above $1,300 for the first time on November 7, potentially setting up a big move higher for the stock. Over the course of the past decade the stock appears to trade with a very similar pattern, which is one where the equity rises significantly and then consolidating for a long period. Based on those patterns the stock could be setting up for its next significant long-term move higher.</p>

      <h3>Valuation Is Reasonable</h3>
      <p>One reason why the shares may finally be moving up is that the valuation of the equity is reasonable given its historical trends. Historically the stock has traded in a range of 16.5 to 26.5 times one-year forward earnings estimates. If the stock returns to the upper end of its historical range at 26.5 from its current 23.9, then the shares could trade for roughly $1,430.</p>

      <p>That valuation isn’t far off from average analysts' price targets on Alphabet. Currently, 44 analysts cover the stock, and they have an average price target of $1,441, which is about 10.3% higher than the current stock price of around $1,305 on November 7.</p>

      <h3>Results Were Better Than They First Appeared</h3>
      <p>However, despite the stock’s big advance, shares fell following the company’s third quarter results. That is because the company <a href="https://abc.xyz/investor/static/pdf/2019Q3_alphabet_earnings_release.pdf?cache=d41c776">reported earnings of $10.12 per share</a>, which <a href="https://thefly.com/news.php?symbol=GOOGL">was below estimates of $12.42</a>. However, when digging through the company’s income statement the big earnings miss was driven by a sharp decline in equity securities, which fell by $1.5 billion. That resulted in other income falling by $549 million, and a decrease in net income to approximately $7.1 billion versus roughly $9.2 billion the year before. But interestingly, without the sharp declines in the equity portfolio, operating income was better than the prior year at $9.2 billion versus $8.6 billion.</p>
      <p>Investors seem to be recognizing that Alphabet’s results were better than they initially appeared. As a result, the stock may now be breaking out of his 18 month period of stagnation.</p>
