      <p>COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) - Missouri’s health department wants to ban medical marijuana businesses from paying taxes, fines or fees in cash.</p>
      <p>But a hopeful Missouri marijuana producer on Friday told The Associated Press that banning cash payments could shut small businesses out of the industry.</p>
      <p>BeLeaf CEO Mitch Meyers says national banks shy away from working with the marijuana industry because selling cannabis is federally banned.</p>
      <p>Meyers says it took her years to open a state bank account, and her success was based in part on her other CBD oil business. She says small, rural businesses might not be able to access banking.</p>
      <p>The Health and Senior Services Department is accepting public feedback on the proposed emergency rule through Tuesday.</p>
