      <h1>Adobe’s Chief Product Officer Defends Poor User Ratings Of Photoshop For iPad</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T00:00:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Mikelle Leow</a></address>
      <p><b><a href="http://ow.ly/TEGqR?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Adobe</a> software users</b> were absolutely captivated when Apple and Adobe first showed off a “full” <a href="http://ow.ly/TEGu4?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Photoshop</a> for iPad using a <a href="https://designtaxi.com/news/402195/Apple-Demos-Full-Photoshop-On-iPad-Pro-With-3GB-File-157-Layers-Without-Lag/">3GB file</a> with 157 layers sans any lagging. <br/><b>Understandably, creative professionals</b> were looking forward to the app’s launch, but when it finally arrived this week, they were thoroughly disappointed.</p>

      <h3>At present, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adobe-photoshop/id1457771281?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Photoshop for iPad</a> has an underwhelming user rating of 2.1 out of five stars, and most of the 521 users who downloaded the app gave it only one star. Those are dismal numbers given the anticipation for the app.</h3>
      <p><b>Users have described</b> the tool as “premature,” and lamented that it might as well have been named “Photoshop Express” even though Adobe had touted it as a “full Photoshop.” <br/><b>“You released another</b> half-baked program, gimped out without all the features of the desktop, and you want us to pay a subscription fee?” one reviewer wrote. “I want whatever you’re all smoking, because apparently it’s good stuff.” <br/><b>Addressing the criticism</b> on Twitter, Adobe’s Chief Product Officer Scott Belsky justified the program in spite of its poor ratings, defending that it was expected for a longtime favorite like Photoshop to be criticized when ported over to an unfamiliar platform for the first time.</p>
      <h3>“You’ve gotta ship an MVP to start the journey,” Belsky explained. “But it will be painful at first. By definition, it won’t please everyone. And if it’s a reimagination of a 30-year-old popular, global product, [it] will displease many.”</h3>
      <p><a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <br/><b>Belsky added</b> that the app’s developers considered Photoshop on iPad 1.0 to be a success if it “[nailed] PSD support, a few workflows” and redefined the use of some features and UI, “NOT just port 30 years of stuff (and baggage) on day one… It’s our burden to prove the value and exceed expectations.”</p>
      <h3>He added that in hindsight, it was probably inaccurate to market the app as a “full” Photoshop when it didn’t have everything the desktop version had to offer.</h3>
      <p><b>“We didn’t do</b> a good enough job distinguishing between ‘real’... and ‘full,’” he said. A “full” Photoshop would mean a software with every feature available on the desktop version from day one, while a “real” Photoshop meant the iPad app would contain Photoshop’s original codebase and true PSD support. <br/><b>Nevertheless, a “full” Photoshop</b> should be the team’s goal for the app, as Belsky confirmed that an “amazing roadmap of features” have been planned for the iPad version. <br/><b>This week,</b> Adobe’s product team also had to explain why its icons are <a href="https://designtaxi.com/news/407259/Photoshop-Lead-Justifies-Adobe-s-Inconsistent-Icons-But-Users-Aren-t-Convinced/">so “inconsistent,”</a> but its rationale means little to users.</p>
