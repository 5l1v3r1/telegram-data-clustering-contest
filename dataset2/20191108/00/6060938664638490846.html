      <p>While the white bridal lehenga has been in vogue, there's no denying that the colour red has its own charm. The colour red is known to be one of the auspicious shades for Indian weddings and white colour is known for purity and innocence.</p>
      <p>In the last few years, we have seen almost every shade of bridal lehengas, but what recently caught our attention was this white and red lehenga. Bride Misha wore this gorgeous Sabyasachi creation for her wedding in Morocco and looked gorgeous as ever!</p>
