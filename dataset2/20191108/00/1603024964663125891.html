      <p>The Indian rupee declined in the early trade on November 8. It opened lower by 34 paise at 71.30 per dollar versus previous close 70.96.</p>
      <p>On November 7, the rupee ended flat at 70.96 after it pared its initial losses against the US dollar after the US-China trade deal hopes enthused investor sentiments.</p>
      <p>Sustained foreign fund inflows supported the local currency though the gains were capped by hardening crude oil prices.</p>

      <p>The dollar-rupee November contract on the NSE was at 71.04 in the previous session. Open interest increased 7.67% in the previous session, said ICICIdirect.</p>
      <p>We expect the USD-INR to find supports at lower levels. Utilise downsides in the pair to initiate long positions, it added.</p>
      <p>Gold prices on Friday hovered near a one-month low hit in the previous session after China and the United States agreed to roll back tariffs as part of the first phase of a trade deal, stoking investors towards riskier assets</p>
      <p>US crude oil futures fell in the morning trade amid fading hopes that a deal to end the lingering trade war between Washington and Beijing would be signed any time soon, the gloom compounded by rising crude inventories in the United States</p>
      <p>The dollar held on to its gains versus the yen and the Swiss franc as a China-US agreement to roll back tariffs on each othersâ€™ goods supported riskier assets, even as some reports suggest a preliminary trade pact is far from a done deal.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php"><b>Special Thursday Expiry on <s>10<sup>th</sup></s> 7<sup>th</sup> Nov</b><br/>Early Closure to The Great Diwali Discount.
