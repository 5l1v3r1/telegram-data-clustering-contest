      <p>There will be no odd-even restrictions on vehicles on November 11-12 in Delhi to ensure hassle-free commute on the occasion of the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Friday.</p>
      <p>Originally, the government had announced the odd-even scheme between November 4 and November 15 to fight air pollution. It is effective between 8 am and 8 pm.</p>
      <p>The decision has been taken so that there is no disturbance in celebrations of the Sikhism founder's birth anniversary, Kejriwal said at a press conference</p>

      <p>"Several Sikh organisations had met me and demanded that odd-even rules be lifted for November 11 and 12. Thousands of people participate in several programmes on the occasion of Guru Nanak Dev's birth anniversary.</p>
      <p>"In view of this, the Delhi government has decided that there will be no odd-even restrictions on vehicles on November 11-12," the chief minister said.</p>
      <p>The government maintains that due to odd-even rule, nearly 15 lakh of the total 30 lakh vehicles remain off the road everyday.</p>
      <p>On Friday, a total of 293 challans were issued by teams of traffic police (158), transport (94) and revenue (41) departments till 2 pm.</p>
      <p>On November 4, the first day of odd-even road rationing scheme, Kejriwal had termed the exercise as "successful".</p>
      <p>However, the BJP has termed the scheme as an "election stunt" by the Aam Aadmi Party government which was causing harassment to the people.</p>
      <p>Two thousand civil defence volunteers, 465 teams of the Delhi traffic police, revenue and transport departments were deployed on the first day of scheme which will end of November 15.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
