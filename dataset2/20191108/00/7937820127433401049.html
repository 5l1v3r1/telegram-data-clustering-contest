        <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03332-7">AI ‘discovers’ that Earth orbits the Sun</a>
      </h3>
      <p>A neural network that teaches itself the laws of physics could help to solve some of physics’ deepest questions. But first it has to start with the basics, just like the rest of us. The algorithm has <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03332-7">worked out that it should place the Sun at the centre of the Solar System</a>, based on how movements of the Sun and Mars appear from Earth.</p>
      <p>The machine-learning system differs from others because it’s not a ‘black box’ that spits out a result based on reasoning that’s almost impossible to unpick. Instead, researchers designed a kind of ‘lobotomized’ neural network that is split into two halves and joined by just a handful of connections. That forces the learning half to simplify its findings before handing them over to the half that makes and tests new predictions.</p>

        <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03433-3">Next FDA chief will face ongoing challenges</a>
      </h3>
      <p>US President Donald Trump has <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03433-3">nominated radiation oncologist Stephen Hahn to lead the Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA). If the Senate confirms Hahn, who is the chief medical executive of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, he’ll be leading the agency at the centre of a national debate over e-cigarettes, prompted by <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03033-1">a mysterious vaping-related illness</a> that has made more than 2,000 people sick. A former FDA chief says Hahn’s biggest challenge will be navigating a regulatory agency under the Trump administration, which has pledged to roll back regulations.</p>

        <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03432-4">Do we know how big a proton is?</a>
      </h3>
      <p>A long-awaited experimental result has found the proton to be <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03432-4">about 5% smaller than the previously accepted value</a>. The finding seems to spell the end of the ‘proton radius puzzle’: the measurements disagreed if you probed the proton with ordinary hydrogen, or with exotic hydrogen built out of muons instead of electrons. But solving the mystery will be bittersweet: some scientists had hoped the difference might have indicated exciting new physics behind how electrons and muons behave.</p>

      <h4>Nature’s 150th anniversary</h4>

      </h3>
      <p>This week is a really special one for all of us at <i>Nature</i>: it’s 150 years since our first issue, published in November 1869. We’ve been working for well over a year on the delights of our anniversary issue, <a href="https://www.nature.com/immersive/d42859-019-00121-0/index.html">which you can explore in full online</a>.</p>
      <p>
        <b>10 extraordinary Nature papers</b>
      </p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.nature.com/collections/fajcgfjdgh/">series of in-depth articles from specialists in the relevant fields</a> assesses the importance and lasting impact of 10 key papers from <i>Nature</i>’s archive. Among them, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02554-z">the structure of DNA</a>, the discovery of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02837-5">the hole in the ozone layer</a> above Antarctica, our <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02839-3">first meeting with </a><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02839-3"><i>Australopithecus</i></a><i> </i>and this year’s Nobel-winning work detecting <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02553-0">an exoplanet around a Sun-like star</a>.</p>

        <b>A network of science</b>
      </p>
      <p>The multidisciplinary scope of <i>Nature </i>is revealed by an analysis of more than 88,000 papers <i>Nature </i>has published since 1900, and their co-citations in other articles. <a href="https://www.nature.com/immersive/d41586-019-03165-4/index.html">Take a journey through a 3D network of </a><a href="https://www.nature.com/immersive/d41586-019-03165-4/index.html"><i>Nature</i></a><a href="https://www.nature.com/immersive/d41586-019-03165-4/index.html">’s archive in an interactive graphic</a>.

        <b>150 years of Nature, in graphics</b>
      </p>
      <p>An analysis of the <i>Nature </i>archive reveals the rise of multi-author papers, the boom in biochemistry and cell biology, and the ebb and flow of physical chemistry since the journal’s first issue in 1869. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03305-w">The evolution in science is mirrored</a> in the top keywords used in titles and abstracts: they were ‘aurora’, ‘Sun’, ‘meteor’, ‘water’ and ‘Earth’ in the 1870s, and ‘cell’, ‘quantum’, ‘DNA’, ‘protein’ and ‘receptor’ in the 2010s.

        <b>Evidence in pursuit of truth</b>
      </p>
      <p>A century and a half has seen momentous changes in science, and <i>Nature </i>has changed along with it in many ways, says <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03304-x">an Editorial in the anniversary edition</a>. But in other respects, <i>Nature </i>now is just the same as it was at the start: it will continue in its mission to stand up for research, serve the global research community and communicate the results of science around the world.

      <h4>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h4>
      <h3>
        <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/scientists-should-stop-naming-species-after-awful-people/">“At the very least ... we should probably consider no longer naming *new* species after awful humans.”</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Scientists should stop naming animals after terrible people — and consider renaming the ones that already are, argues marine conservation biologist and science writer David Shiffman. (<a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/scientists-should-stop-naming-species-after-awful-people/">Scientific American</a>)</p>
