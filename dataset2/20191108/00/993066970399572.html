      <p>Emmerdale character Ellis Chapman has been recast after actor Asan N’Jie was sacked from the soap in September.</p>
      <p>N’Jie’s contract on the soap was terminated by ITV after he reportedly brawled with Hollyoaks star Jamie Lomas at the TV Choice Awards.</p>
      <p>He had appeared in the soap since 2018 and was nominated for best newcomer at the awards ceremony for a storyline involving Ellis being stabbed.</p>

      <p>Ellis will now be played by Aaron Anthony, who has had TV roles in Delicious and Doctors.</p>
      <p>Emmerdale viewers last month saw N’Jie bow out of the soap as Ellis went to Dubai to work at his mother Jessie’s school as a PE assistant.</p>
      <p>But Ellis will be back in the village in December, returning unannounced just as tensions grow between his father Al (Michael Wildman) and brother Billy (Jay Kontzle).</p>
      <p>Anthony said: “Emmerdale is a cracking show with a brilliant cast that I’m over the moon to now be a part of.</p>
      <p>“I know Ellis is a well-loved character and I’m looking forward to continuing his journey and all that’s in store for him.”</p>
      <p>N’Jie later apologised for his “completely unacceptable” behaviour at the awards ceremony.</p>
      <p>He was reported to have sworn and thrown punches at Lomas, 44, following the ceremony at the Hilton Park Lane in Mayfair, London.</p>
      <p>Following his termination, the actor said in a statement that he wanted “to learn” from his actions.</p>
      <p>“My behaviour at the TV Choice Awards was completely unacceptable and very much out of character,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I sincerely apologise to everybody who has been affected especially Jamie Lomas, the whole Emmerdale team, our audience, ITV, my family, and the organisers of the TV Choice Awards.</p>
      <p>“I am devastated, accept full responsibility for my actions and I am determined to learn from this.”</p>
