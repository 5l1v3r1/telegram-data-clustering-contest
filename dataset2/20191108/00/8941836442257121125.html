      <h1>Hamstring to keep Vikings WR Adam Thielen out vs Cowboys</h1>

      <p>EAGAN, Minn. (AP) - The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/minnesota-vikings/">Minnesota Vikings</a> don’t need a lesson on the lasting nature of hamstring trouble. They endured a tough one just last year.</p>
      <p>Running back Dalvin Cook had a long absence in 2018 because of a hamstring injury. Now wide receiver <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/adam-thielen/">Adam Thielen</a> could be sidelined for the rest of the month.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/minnesota-vikings/">Vikings</a> ruled <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/adam-thielen/">Thielen</a> out for Sunday night at Dallas, increasing the possibility the two-time Pro Bowl pick will rest for the Nov. 17 game against Denver. With the following bye, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/adam-thielen/">Thielen</a> would get four weeks of recuperation before the Dec. 1 game at Seattle.</p>
      <p>The rest may get him to full strength for the final stretch.</p>
      <p>“Whenever the doctors say he’s ready, then he’s ready,” coach Mike Zimmer said this week, describing <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/adam-thielen/">Thielen</a>’s condition as not a “long-term deal.”</p>

      <p>Last season, Cook hurt his hamstring in the second game. He missed the next one but played 11 days later, only to suffer a setback and find himself out of action for the next four games. Everybody is different, but the quick-twitch acceleration provided by the hamstring is a must for a skill-position player and needs careful treatment.</p>
      <p>“It’s a tricky thing. Your body can feel good when you go out there, and then all of a sudden it comes out of nowhere,” Cook said.</p>
      <p>His advice to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/adam-thielen/">Thielen</a>?</p>
      <p>“Just don’t let that one game turn into two, three, four. I kind of dealt with that,” Cook said. “Just take your time and re-evaluate it. Just do what’s best for you and don’t come back until you’re 100 percent. We need that guy on the field.”</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/adam-thielen/">Thielen</a> was hurt during a first-quarter touchdown reception on Oct. 20 at Detroit and held out the next week against Washington. It was the first absence of his six-year NFL career. He returned to the lineup last Sunday at Kansas City before aggravating the injury and being sidelined in the first quarter.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/minnesota-vikings/">Vikings</a> also declared nose tackle Linval Joseph (knee) out for Sunday and listed cornerback Trae Waynes (ankle) as questionable. The 10th-year veteran Joseph has come back strong this season after being banged up with multiple injuries for much of 2018, with 40 tackles, 10 quarterback hits and three sacks.</p>
        <p>Joseph has only missed five games in six years with the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/minnesota-vikings/">Vikings</a>. Zimmer declined to answer a question on Friday about whether Joseph’s injury could be long term.</p>
