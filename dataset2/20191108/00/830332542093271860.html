      <p>(CNN) - Sixty years after his death, monuments to Frank Lloyd Wright's innovative vision remain etched into the architectural landscape.</p>
      <p>For a fortunate few, owning a structure he designed is within reach.</p>
      <p>Wright's final residential design, the Norman Lykes House, recently sold at auction for $1,677,500.</p>
      <p>The October 16 auction, held by Heritage Auctions, drew nearly 20 bidders vying for ownership of the iconic home.</p>
      <p>"The new owner of the last home designed by Frank Lloyd Wright now owns a masterpiece by America's most iconic architect," Nate Schar, director of luxury real estate for Heritage Auctions, said <a href="https://realestate.ha.com/information/luxury-real-estate-showcase-20003.s?ic=LRE-20003-081419">in a statement</a>.</p>
      <p>Nicknamed the "Circular Sun House," the 3,000-square-foot home is tucked into a rocky hillside in Phoenix, Arizona.</p>
      <p>Wright designed the home for Norman and Amy Lykes just before his death, drawing upon his concept of organic architecture.</p>
      <p>Wright's designs were intended to be both functional and beautifully tailored compositions in which clients would be able to live practically.</p>
      <p>The Norman Lykes House lives up to Wright's goals. Its circular elements fit beautifully into the rugged desert surroundings.</p>
