      <h1>Trump Advisers Want to Get WiFi, Amazon Deliveries in National Parks</h1>

      <h3>WiFistone</h3>
      <p>If the current administration has its way, your next outdoor camping experience at Yellowstone could include things like WiFi connectivity and Amazon deliveries.</p>
      <p>A number of Trump administration advisers have offered their “modernized” vision of national park campgrounds, including WiFi, food trucks, electric bike rentals, flushable toilets, and even Amazon deliveries, the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2019-11-04/trump-administration-privatize-national-parks-tourism"><i>Los Angeles</i> Times reports</a>.</p>
      <p>It’s a troubling instance of a much larger attempt to privatize a large number of public services by the White House, including the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trumps-privatization-plan-would-destroy-the-postal-service/2018/08/07/caaf9a24-99a2-11e8-8d5e-c6c594024954_story.html">U.S. Postal Service</a> and even <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2018/06/23/there-is-a-movement-to-privatize-public-education-in-america-heres-how-far-it-is-has-gotten/">public education</a>.</p>
      <h3>Heritage on the Line</h3>
      <p>The advisors’ proposal was summarized in <a href="https://www.nps.gov/orgs/1892/upload/ORAC_recommendations_letter_to_DOI-Oct102019.pdf">a public letter</a> to the Interior Department.</p>
      <p>“Our recommendations would allow people to opt for additional costs if they want, for example, Amazon deliveries at a particular campsite,” Derrick Crandall, vice-chairman of an outdoor recreation advisory committee, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2019-11-04/trump-administration-privatize-national-parks-tourism">told the <i>Los Angeles Times</i></a>. “We want to let Americans make their own decisions in the marketplace.”</p>
      <p>But critics argue that it could threaten the sanctity of national parks and give too much control to private industry players.</p>
      <p>“America’s outdoor heritage is on the line,” Jayson O’Neill, deputy director of the Western Values Project, a nonprofit public lands group, told the <i>LA Times</i>. “The trouble with these recommendations is that they were written by concessionaire industry representatives vying for more control of national parks.”</p>
