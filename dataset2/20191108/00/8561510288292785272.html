      <h1>Watch a Piece of Metal Refuse to Sink in Water</h1>

      <h3>Seeing Double</h3>
      <p>Researchers from the University of Rochester just released a video that looks like an optical illusion. In the clip, they place two seemingly identical metal structures into a glass of water. But while one sinks to the bottom — you know, as you’d expect something metal to do — the other floats.</p>
      <p>That’s because the structures aren’t actually identical — and the one that floats could lead to the creation of unsinkable ships.</p>

      <h3>Unsinkable Metal</h3>
      <p>On Wednesday, the researchers published a <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsami.9b15540">study</a> in the journal <i>ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces</i> detailing their creation of the bizarre unsinkable metal.</p>
      <p>Using extremely short laser bursts, they etched air-trapping patterns into two aluminum plates. They then created a structure in which the two plates were parallel to one another, with the etched surfaces facing inward but not quite touching.</p>
      <h3>Float On</h3>
      <p>The final result looks a bit like a really flat spool, but the tiny distance between the two plates is perfect for trapping air, even if the structure is submerged in water for months or punctured multiple times.</p>
      <p>“This could allow ships to be made truly unsinkable,” the researchers note in the video, “even if they are severely damaged at sea.”</p>
