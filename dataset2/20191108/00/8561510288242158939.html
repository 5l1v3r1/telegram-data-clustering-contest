      <h1>Watch a Piece of a SpaceX Rocket Careen Back Down to Earth</h1>

      <h3>Heavy Fairings</h3>
      <p>SpaceX has released an amazing video that shows half of a nose cone from a Falcon Heavy rocket, also known as a “fairing,” plummet back down to Earth. The giant piece of metal — used to give the rocket its aerodynamic shape — will be reused during a Falcon 9 launch early next week, according to the space company.</p>

      <p>In the video, taken back in April, you can see one half of the fairing separate from the rocket’s payload, an Arabsat-6A communications satellite. As the fairing spins, you can see the Earth swoop by below.</p>
      <h3>Like a Glove</h3>
      <p>SpaceX has been making progress in gently catching its nose cones using <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/watch-spacex-catch-rockets-nose-cone">special net-wielding boats</a>. The company managed the incredible feat for the <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/spacex-falcon-heavy-launch-success-booster">first time</a> back in June after launching its massive Falcon Heavy rocket.</p>
      <p>The two nose cone halves in the video, however, splashed into the ocean to be retrieved later.</p>
      <p>SpaceX has made major strides in making almost every part of its rockets reusable. Next week, a Falcon 9 will carry 60 of the company’s Starlink internet satellites into space, marking <a href="https://www.space.com/spacex-tests-rocket-next-starlink-launch.html">the first time</a> a Falcon 9 first-stage booster has been used four times.</p>
