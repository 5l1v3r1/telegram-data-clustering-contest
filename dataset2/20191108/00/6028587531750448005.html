To the naked eye, this coffee table is just a chic mix of dark wood and marble and is purely decorative, but it can do so much more. The dark stained eucalyptus wood table top pops open to reveal storage space to conceal everything from remotes to magazines. The pop-up also doubles as a table top so your couch can transform into a workstation or counter in seconds. The marble slab on the opposite side is the perfect surface for testing out your coffee table decorating skills, and the open shelf underneath is great for showing off your latest reads.
