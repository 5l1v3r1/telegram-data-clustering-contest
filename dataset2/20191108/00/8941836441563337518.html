      <p>GULFPORT, Miss. (AP) - Police in Mississippi say a teenage mother charged with killing her 3-month-old son is accused of fracturing his skull and leg.</p>
      <p>The Biloxi Sun-Herald reports the investigation has revealed the child also had brain bleeding and severe hemorrhaging when he was admitted to a Gulfport hospital in September. Gulfport police say 17-year-old Yakira Yaffa Nicole Caffrey didn’t offer a reasonable explanation of how he was injured. She’s charged with second-degree murder. The newspaper reports investigators determined the infant had been abused, and a coroner ruled the death a homicide.</p>

        <p>The outlet says Caffrey was unable to appear Wednesday at a preliminary hearing in Justice Court to determine if her case will go to a grand jury. Harrison County Prosecuting Attorney Herman Cox said a new hearing date will be set.</p>
