      <p>NEW YORK (AP) - Major League Soccer’s New York City team will have its fourth coach in six seasons.</p>
      <p>The team said Friday it has reached an agreement for coach Domènec Torrent to depart, a decision that followed a loss to Toronto in Major League Soccer’s Eastern Conference semifinals.</p>
      <p>A former assistant to Pep Guardiola at parent club Manchester City, Torrent succeeded Patrick Vieira in June 2018. Jason Kreis coached NYC in 2015, its initial season.</p>
      <p>NYC vice chairman Marty Edelman says in a statement the team spoke with Torrent and “we’ve decided that this is the right moment for both parties to focus on new opportunities.”</p>
      <p>Assistant coaches Albert Puig and Jordi Gris also are leaving along with director of Performance Francesc Cos, and head of performance Ismael Camenforte.</p>
