      <p>Moody’s Investors Service on November 7 changed its outlook on India’s ratings to "negative" from "stable", citing increasing risks that the country’s economic growth will remain lower than in the past.</p>
      <p>The outlook partly reflects government and policy ineffectiveness in addressing economic weakness, which led to an increase in debt burden from already high levels, the rating agency said.</p>
      <p>India’s economy grew only 5 percent year-on-year (YoY) between April and June, its weakest pace since 2013, as consumer demand and government spending slowed amid global trade frictions.</p>

      <p>The international rating agency said it estimates that the country’s growth slowdown is in part long-lasting while backing its other ratings for India.</p>
      <p>Reacting to the downgrade, the Finance Ministry said that India continues to be amongst the fastest-growing major economies in the world and that India's relative standing remains unaffected.</p>
      <p>Citing the International Monetary Fund (IMF) outlook which stated that India's economy is set to grow at 6.1 percent in 2019 and 7 percent in 2020, the Ministry added that the government has taken a series of reforms in the financial and other sectors to strengthen the economy.</p>
      <p>"Th government proactively took policy decisions in response to the global slowdown and these steps will lead to a positive outlook on India and attract capital flows," it stated.</p>
      <p>"The fundamentals of the Indian economy remains robust with inflation under check. India continues to offer strong growth prospects in the near and medium-term," it added.</p>
