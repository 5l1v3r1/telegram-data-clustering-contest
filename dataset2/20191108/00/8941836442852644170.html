      <p>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) - Companies involved in work at a former uranium enrichment plant in Ohio say a federal court should dismiss a lawsuit alleging nearby residents were unknowingly exposed to radioactive contaminants that spread to other properties.</p>
      <p>Several residents sued the companies over contamination from the site of the former Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Piketon and construction of a waste-disposal facility there. They seek damages and medical monitoring, and class-action status to represent nearby residents and students at a school where radioactive material was found.</p>

        <p>In a filing this week, defendants argued the case should be dismissed because the claims weren’t brought under a federal law governing liability-related matters for nuclear facilities. Those defendants include cleanup contractors and the company that ran a uranium enrichment project at the site in recent years.</p>
