      <p>The UFC is in Moscow on Saturday for UFC Fight Night 163. The main event of the card features a featherweight matchup between Zabit Magomedsharipov and Calvin Kattar. Magomedsharipov has been on fire since he joined the UFC in 2017. Currently the No. 5 ranked fighter in the official UFC 145-pound rankings, Magomedsharipov is 5-0 with the UFC with three post-fight bonus awards and three stoppages. His most recent win was a March unanimous decision victory over Jeremy Stephens. Kattar, who is the No. 11 ranked featherweight, is 4-1 in the UFC with one “Fight of the Night” bonus-winning victory. Kattar, who has three knockout wins with the promotion, is coming off a June knockout victory over former 145-pound title challenger Ricardo Lamas. In the co-main event, No. 7 ranked heavyweight Alexander Volkov faces Greg Hardy. Hardy stepped in as a late replacement for Junior dos Santos. </p>
      <p>Before the six-fight main card, which streams on ESPN+, the UFC presents seven preliminary card bouts. </p>
      <p>Early in the prelim card, Jessica-Rose Clark returns to action for the first time since she dropped a decision to Jessica Eye in June 2018. Clark underwent foot surgery after that loss. She faces Pannie Kianzad in Moscow. Kianzad is coming off a unanimous decision setback to Julia Avila in July. These two met in 2015 on an Invicta FC card. Kianzad won that matchup by unanimous decision.</p>
      <p>Rustam Khabilov is also on the prelims. He faces Sergey Khandozhko in a welterweight scrap. Khabilov only fought once in 2017 and 2018. He brought a six-fight winning streak into his most recent fight, but that streak ended when he dropped a decision to Carlos Diego Ferreira. Khandozhko made his UFC debut in June. He defeated Rostem Akman by decision in that outing.</p>
      <p>A light heavyweight bout between Magomed Ankalaev and Dalcha Lungiambula sits at the top of the prelim card. Ankalaev is 2-1 in the UFC, while Lungiambula is 1-0 with the promotion. </p>
