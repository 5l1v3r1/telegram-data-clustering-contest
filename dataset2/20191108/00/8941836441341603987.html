      <p>NORTH PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) - Prosecutors say the former superintendent in North Providence has pleaded no contest to embezzlement for misusing a school-issued credit card.</p>
      <p>Attorney General Peter Neronha says 49-year-old Bridget Morisseau, formerly of Cumberland, entered the plea Friday in Providence County Superior Court. She was sentenced to three years of probation and ordered to pay nearly $9,500 in restitution within a week.</p>
      <p>Neronha says the personal expenditures included payments for airfare, catering, resort accommodations and a hotel stay, and the school department made payments to Morisseau that were outside the scope of her contract.</p>
      <p>Morisseau resigned in July 2018 after being accused of misusing district funds. The school committee accepted her resignation and commissioned an audit.</p>
