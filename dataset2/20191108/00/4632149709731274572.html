      <p><i>Work on chemical synthesis for biomedical applications noticed</i> <br/><br/>A professor of the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) is one of the recipients of the Infosys Prize 2019. G Mugesh, a professor of the department of inorganic and physical chemistry, IISc, bagged the Infosys Prize in the Physical Sciences category. <br/><br/>He has been awarded for his work on the chemical synthesis of small molecules and nanomaterials for biomedical applications. <br/><br/>According to the foundation, his work has contributed to the understanding of the role of trace elements, selenium and iodine in thyroid hormone activation and metabolism, and this research has led to major medical advances. <br/><br/>Mugesh said that he is overwhelmed by the award as he hails from a small village comprising about 20 houses and that his parents never went to school. <br/><br/>“We will be working on two areas. One is developing compounds that can regulate cardiovascular diseases and the other is Alzheimers,” Mugesh said.</p>
