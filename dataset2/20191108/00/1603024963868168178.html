      <p>BMS general secretary Vrijesh Upadhya was addressing a press conference to announce celebrations beginning November 10 for the birth centenary of Dattopant Thengdi, an economic thinker and founder of the BMS, Swadeshi Jagran Manch and Kisan Sangh.

Hence, more deliberation is needed," he said.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
