      <p>The Karnataka Textbooks Society held a meeting with regard to removing chapters pertaining to Tipu Sultan from State syllabus textbooks. This issue started after BJP MLA from Madikere Appachu Ranjan wrote to the minister for Primary and Secondary education S Suresh Kumar last month. <br/><br/>On Thursday in the meeting, the Textbooks Society asked Ranjan to point out mistakes in the textbooks with respect to Tipu Sultan as there was no concrete argument to it. <br/><br/><br/>The society received documents from the MLA and others and said it will go through all the documents before submitting a report to the State Government. An official from the Society said, “We have taken all the documents and we will submit a report.”</p>
