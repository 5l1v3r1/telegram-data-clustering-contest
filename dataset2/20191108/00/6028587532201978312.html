The printer is capable of printing up to 10.5 pages per minute, and it works wirelessly — which makes using it a whole lot simpler. </p>

Because it's such a great device, the MX Master 2S is normally pretty expensive at $99.99, but you can now get it for $68.89 straight from Amazon.</p>

      <p>A seemingly small design change in this mouse makes a world of difference for remote workers. Located under the thumb, the Logitech trackball lets you move your cursor accurately across the screen without having to move your whole arm. This results in much quicker and precise control over your screen. It also means you can use the mouse without a desk underneath -- giving you complete flexibility to work from the couch, the armchair or even your bed.</p>
      <p>This uniquely designed Logitech mouse is contoured to support every part of your hand, resulting in a comfortable, easy-to-use device. It makes sense for something that’s designed to be used anywhere, anytime for maximum enjoyment and versatility.</p>

      <h4>Apple Magic Mouse 2</h4>

      <p>While the deal on this one is minimal, any discount is worth taking a look at considering how expensive Apple accessories can be. Unlike most computer mice, the Apple Magic Mouse 2 is built with a trackpad sensor that reacts much like other Apple products. This means you can intuitively swipe, scroll and zoom with the touch of a finger. Plus, whereas other mice often become defective because their scroll wheel breaks, there’s no risk of that happening here.</p>
      <p>The mouse is completely wireless so you won’t have to use up one of your USB ports to enable it. This is a bonus for many latest-generation laptop owners, as companies seem to be limiting the number of ports in new computers in favor of thinner, more portable devices. Completely rechargeable, the Apple Magic Mouse should last over one month on a single charge. Sure you’re spending a little more upfront, but at least you’re not running to the store to buy new batteries every few months.</p>

      <p>If you work from home and don’t yet have an external hard drive, you should consider investing in one. Not only will storing unused files on a storage device help your computer work more quickly, but it can prevent the loss of valuable computer files. This 4TB hard drive from Seagate comes with a two-year warranty and is equipped with two front USB 3.0 ports, making it easier for you to transfer files between devices. The best practice is to leave it plugged into your computer, as the hard drive’s automatic backup software keeps all your files synced and protected.</p>
