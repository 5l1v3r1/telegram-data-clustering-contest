      <p>There is a possibility of government selling its 53.29 per cent stake along with management control in oil marketing and refining firm for about USD 10 billion (around Rs 70,900 crore)</p>
      <p>"As far as the privatisation issue is concerned, BPCL has not been told anything officially so far. I have not got any idea of any other information about any concrete proposal from the government side," BPCL director (finance) N Vijayagopal told reporters on Friday.</p>

      <p>He said the Cabinet is yet to take a decision for disinvestment of BPCL.</p>
      <p>"The decision can be taken at the level of the Cabinet committee and that has not happened so far," Vijayagopal said.</p>
      <p>It is being speculated that the Union Cabinet may take up a proposal to privatise BPCL as early as next week.</p>
      <p>Stake sale in BPCL is critical for the government to meet its disinvestment target of Rs 1.05 lakh crore set for the current fiscal year.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
