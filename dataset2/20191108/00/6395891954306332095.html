      <p><b>WESTFIELD, Mass.</b> - A former Westfield police officer has been charged for the 2018 murder of his wife.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, 55-year-old Brian Fanion was arraigned in Hampden Superior Court on one count of first-degree murder for the shooting death of his wife, 51-year-old Amy J. Fanion.</p>
      <p>On May 8, 2018, Fanion called 911 to report his wife had shot herself with his gun. Amy was declared dead on scene.</p>
      <p>Fanion told police he had been on-duty but had come home from lunch when his wife used his service weapon to kill herself.</p>
      <p>An autopsy performed the next day found Amy died from a gunshot wound, but the manner of death was left undetermined pending additional analysis.</p>
      <p>During the investigation, a search warrant for Fanion's home seized various digital evidence items, including computers, tablets, and cellular devices. Forensic analysis of the evidence collected found incriminating evidence against Fanion.</p>
      <p>On Nov. 6, 2019, following a months-long investigation, a grand jury issued an indictment against Fanion for the murder of his wife. He was then arrested shortly after at his home.</p>
      <p>Fanion was held without bail following his arraignment. He is scheduled to go back to court on Jan. 9, 2020.</p>
