      <h1>Twitter’s ‘Best Dad Joke’ Is Hidden Within Its Own Design</h1>

      <p><b>Twitter is the home</b> of <a href="https://designtaxi.com/news/407227/Boomers-Have-Uncovered-The-Term-OK-Boomer-And-They-Are-Not-Happy/">internet memes</a>, but it turns out its most timeless joke is hiding in plain sight in its own interface. <br/><b>Scott Jehl,</b> designer and developer at Boston design studio Filament Group, has <a href="https://twitter.com/scottjehl/status/1192185414884511744?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">shared</a> a tweet that has since gone viral, though he wasn’t the creator of the joke. The gag comes straight from Twitter’s UI. <br/><b>In a GIF</b> uploaded by Jehl, he moves his cursor over to “Show more replies” under a tweet, only for the text “More replies” to appear. <br/><b>The designer</b> called the detail “Twitter’s best dad joke,” and thousands of Twitter users agree. <br/><a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <br/><b>It’s likely that</b> “More replies” shows up when users who have replied to a tweet have had their accounts locked, thus making their posts invisible to outsiders. <br/><b>Whether you enjoy</b> dad jokes or not, it’s received its desired response of either making people chuckle or roll their eyes.</p>
