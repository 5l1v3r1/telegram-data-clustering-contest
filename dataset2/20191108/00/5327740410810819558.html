      <h1>Family renews appeal for tips in Lower Mainland after Terrace man killed in hit-and-run</h1>
      <h2>Suspects and witnesses are believed to be Lower Mainland residents</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T00:00:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.northdeltareporter.com/author/natalia-balcerzak/" target="_blank">Natalia Balcerzak</a></address>
      <p>The family of a Terrace man killed in a hit-and-run last November are renewing their appeal for more information as they look for closure.</p>
      <p>Cameron Kerr, 30, was struck and killed by a vehicle in the early morning hours of Nov. 18, 2018 while walking eastward on Hwy 16 toward Terrace from New Remo.</p>
      <p>The Kerr family made two public appeals last year, pleading for the driver and witnesses to come forward. RCMP identified a primary suspect from the Lower Mainland but did not have enough evidence to pursue charges.</p>
      <p>This time they’ll be taping an appeal at the Terrace RCMP detachment for release on Nov. 18, the anniversary date of Cameron’s death.</p>

      <p>Sgt. Shawn McLaughlin, from RCMP’s West Pacific Region Traffic Services, said during the Kerr family’s second appeal on Dec. 19, 2018, that the case has all the complexities of a homicide investigation and multiple RCMP agencies were involved.</p>
      <p>RCMP said they were confident that more than one person was involved in the Nov. 18, 2018 hit-and-run, where Kerr was struck and killed by an oncoming pickup truck at high speed sometime between 3 a.m. and 7 a.m. His body was found in the ditch by a member of the public around noon the same day.</p>

      <p>Cameron’s family said during their second appeal last year that the silence from potential witnesses was denying them the chance to come to terms with his death.</p>
      <p>Cameron was well known in paddling and other outdoor recreation communities throughout the Northwest. A former member of the Terrace River Kings hockey team and a tradesman by profession, he is remembered by family and friends as a kind and generous individual, and an important part of the community.</p>
