      <h1>Watch a Pack of MIT’s Mini Robots Cavort in Autumn Leaves</h1>

      <h3>Frolick Bots</h3>
      <p>Here at Futurism, we ask ourselves every day what the future looks like. And it looks like we finally found the answer: half a dozen robotics geeks from MIT standing in a circle, each remotely controlling a backflipping mini robot.</p>

      <p>In a video uploaded by MIT’s Biomimetics department, nine Mini Cheetah robots can be seen rustling up some autumn leaves and doing the occasional backflip.</p>
      <p>It’s a wholesome autumnal moment — or perhaps the last thing you see, if you subscribe to a “Black Mirror” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xejjA2AFO5I">vision of the future</a>.</p>
      <h3>Perfect Size</h3>
      <p>Each Mini Cheetah can run at 6 mph and weighs only 20 pounds, about the size and weight of a medium-sized dog.</p>
      <p>“Mini Cheetah is just about the perfect size. 20 pounds is not too small but not so big that it’s dangerous or fragile,” director of MIT’s Biomimetics lab Sangbae Kim <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/robotics-hardware/mit-mini-cheetah-accelerate-research">told <i>IEEE Spectrum</i></a> earlier this year. “We designed the machine to be able to absorb the impacts, jumping and landing and so on.”</p>
      <p>And no, they won’t murder you in your sleep — they may be mobile, but they don’t have a lot of smarts, as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/11/8/20954917/robot-dog-pack-frolicking-leaves-mit-mini-cheetah"><i>The Verge</i> points out</a>. While other quadripedal robots such as <a href="https://futurism.com/boston-dynamics-spot-mini-robot-dogs-truck">Boston Dynamics’ Spot</a> can <a href="https://qz.com/1276281/softbanks-boston-dynamics-will-start-selling-its-spotmini-robots-in-2019/">patrol</a> on a predetermined route, these little guys aren’t able to do much more than run in circles and do backflips.</p>
