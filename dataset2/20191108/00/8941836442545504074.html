      <p>LAS VEGAS (AP) - O.J. Simpson is suing a Las Vegas hotel-casino, alleging unnamed employees defamed him by telling celebrity news site TMZ he was ordered off the property in 2017 for being drunk, disruptive and unruly.</p>
      <p>The former football star denies in the lawsuit filed Thursday against the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas that he was belligerent, broke glass or damaged property.</p>
      <p>The Cosmopolitan declined to comment. TMZ is not a defendant in the case.</p>
      <p>The complaint acknowledges Simpson got a notice banning him from the property after he spent several hours at a steakhouse and a lounge.</p>
      <p>The 72-year-old Simpson is on parole from prison and living in Las Vegas.</p>
