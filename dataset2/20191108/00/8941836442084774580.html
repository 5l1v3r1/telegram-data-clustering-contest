      <p>LONDON (AP) - An armed mugger was jailed for 10 years on Friday after attempting to rob Arsenal soccer players Mesut Ozil and Sead Kolasinac of luxury watches worth 200,000 pounds ($255,000).</p>
      <p>Harrow Crown Court in London heard that Ashley Smith and his accomplice did not count on Bosnia defender Kolasinac fighting back.</p>
      <p>Ozil then drove the two players from the ambush as the would-be robbers pursued them on a stolen moped and threw stones, the court heard.</p>
      <p>Both players were unharmed.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old Smith was described by the judge, Ian Bourne, as a prolific “career criminal” who was well known to police.</p>

      <p>Smith had previously pleaded guilty to the attempted robbery just feet from Kolasinac’s home in Hampstead, north west London, on July 25.</p>
      <p>Smith and Jordan Northover, 26, had been circling the area when they targeted the players.</p>
      <p>The judge said that Kolasinac “must have been terrified by the events which took place immediately outside his house.”</p>
      <p>Smith and Northover were “armed and dangerous” and were using a knitting needle and a pointed screwdriver as weapons, according to the judge.</p>

        <p>He said: “Between them they produced these weapons which they threatened Mr. Kolasinac with, a long pointed blade which was thrust in the victim’s direction and made contact with him.</p>
        <p>“The two of them had not counted on Mr. Kolasinac fighting back and he behaved incredibly bravely.”</p>
        <p>The court heard that footage showed Kolasinac attempting to engage with the culprits, but he was able to get in the car which was then driven away by Ozil.</p>
        <p>Northover is to be sentenced at a later date which has yet to be set.</p>
