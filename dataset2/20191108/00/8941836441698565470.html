      <p>WILLCOX, Ariz. (AP) - A flat desert grassland in southeastern Arizona is being considered as a potential landing site for a new reusable spacecraft.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/boeing/">Boeing</a> representatives plan a public meeting Wednesday evening at the Willcox Community Center to discuss the Starliner spacecraft potentially touching down in the Willcox Playa area.</p>
      <p>Other possible landing sites include White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, Dugway Proving Ground in Utah and Edwards Air Force Base in California.</p>
      <p>About 65 miles (105 kilometers) east of Tucson, Willcox Playa is winter habitat for thousands of migratory sandhill cranes.</p>
      <p>The Starliner capsule made a safety test flight Monday at White Sands.</p>
