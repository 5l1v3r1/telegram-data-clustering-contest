      <p>Overall volumes in Q2FY20 declined by 16 percent YoY led by 8 percent fall in tractor volumes and 21 percent drop in auto volumes.</p>
      <p>"We expect revenues to decline by 11 percent YoY in Q2FY20," said Kotak Institutional Equities, which expects profit to fall 25 percent YoY.</p>
      <p>Motilal Oswal, which expects a 12.4 percent drop in profits, said the company's realisation was expected to improve 3.7 percent YoY (down 1 percent QoQ), as the impact of price increase would partly be offset by the product mix.</p>
      <p>At operating level, Kotak expects EBITDA margin to decline by 120 bps YoY due to negative operating leverage.</p>
      <p>Motilal Oswal has cut its consolidated EPS for FY20/21 by 20.4 percent/12 percent, as it cut volumes by 11 percent/5.5 percent to factor in uncertainties in the utility vehicle volumes.</p>
      <p>"We cut FY20/21 margins by 130bp/50bp each to 14 percent/13.5 percent due to operating deleverage and BS6 challenge and also factoring in the corporate tax rate cut benefits," said the brokerage, which maintained a buy call on the stock.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
