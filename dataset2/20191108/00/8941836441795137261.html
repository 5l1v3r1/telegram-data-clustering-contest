      <p>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) - Minnesota health care provider <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/healthpartner/">HealthPartner</a> says it will close 30 of its retail pharmacies next year amid a broader shrinking of the industry.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/minnesota-public-radio/">Minnesota Public Radio</a> News reported Friday that about 300 workers will lose their jobs as a result of the closures. The company, which sells health insurance and also runs hospitals and clinics, declined to comment to the radio station.</p>
      <p>The retail pharmacy industry has been shrinking for over a decade, starting with the closing of many independent pharmacies in rural areas.</p>
      <p>The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts no growth in pharmacy jobs through 2028.</p>
      <p>Sarah Derr, executive director of the Minnesota Pharmacists Association, says organizations like hers recognize prescriptions might be filled by machines in the future.  </p>
