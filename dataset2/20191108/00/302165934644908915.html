      <p>LONDON, Nov 8 — The BBC and three smaller British TV channels launched a joint streaming service yesterday aimed at challenging Netflix’s dominance on the UK market.</p>
      <p>BritBox will offer paid subscriptions that feature popular shows such as the <i>Downton Abbey</i> historical drama and the <i>Love Island</i> reality television hit from the privately-owned ITV.</p>
      <p>The tie-up, whose services are already partially available in the United States and Canada, was expanded yesterday to include publically-owned Channel 4 and the Viacom-owned Channel 5.</p>
      <p>BritBox is being billed by the four as “the biggest collection of British box sets available in one place”.</p>
      <p>The subscription will initially cost £5.99 (RM31.67) a month.</p>
      <p>Netflix prices range from £5.99 for its basic service to £8.99 for its standard plan. Amazon Prime’s streaming service also costs £5.99.</p>
      <p>Some analysts say BritBox’s limited investment in original contect may spell trouble in a crowded and highly competitive market.</p>
      <p>“Viewers will struggle to differentiate it from Netflix and Amazon, which have long broadcast ITV and BBC programmes,” media analyst Tom Harrington told AFP.</p>
      <p>Figures provided by the BBC and ITV for July show more than 12 million UK households subscribing to at least one streaming service — and four million paying for multiple platforms. — AFP-Relaxnews</p>
