      <p>MADRID (AP) - Spain coach Robert Moreno called up 21-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dinamo-zagreb/">Dinamo Zagreb</a> attacking midfielder <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dani-olmo/">Dani Olmo</a> for the first time on Friday for a pair of European Championship qualifying matches.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dani-olmo/">Olmo</a> came up through Barcelona’s training academy before joining the Croatian club. He helped Spain win this year’s under-21 European Championship.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dani-olmo/">Olmo</a> has also scored three goals for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dinamo-zagreb/">Dinamo</a> in qualifying for the group stage of the Champions League, where he has added one more. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dinamo-zagreb/">Dinamo</a> has one win, two draws and a loss in Group C.</p>
      <p>Spain has already qualified for Euro 2020. It will host Malta in Cádiz on Nov. 15 and Romania in Madrid three days later.</p>
      <p>Moreno also recalled strikers Álvaro Morata and Paco Alcacer, both of whom missed the last squad for games against Norway and Sweden.</p>
