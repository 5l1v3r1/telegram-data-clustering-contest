      <p>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) - Kentucky officers responding to an active shooter at a <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/louisville/">Louisville</a> supermarket shot and killed a man with a gun, their police chief said.</p>
      <p>Louisville Metro Police Chief <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/steve-conrad/">Steve Conrad</a> said officers arriving at a <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kroger/">Kroger</a> Thursday evening found “a man firing a gun and firing shots outside the entrance of the store.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/steve-conrad/">Conrad</a> says the man shot at the officers, who returned fire, killing him. His name hasn’t been released. No other injuries were reported.</p>
      <p>The chief said officers were near the store and “able to respond very very quickly.” He said it apparently began with “an altercation in the store between two men.”</p>
      <p>Customers and workers scrambled for safety, he said: “Some were able to flee, others sheltered in place.”</p>
