      <h2>Getting all dressed up in M&amp;S clothes, people throw some mad shapes to House of Pain's Jump Around</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T00:01:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 00:01</time> by <a rel="author">Will Twigger, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/will-twigger/</a></address>
      <p>Marks and Spencer have unveiled their latest Christmas offering.</p>
      <p>The new ad for the festive season features classic Christmas settings with a twist.</p>
      <p>House of Pain's Jump Around blares over the ad, with everyone who dons an M&amp;S piece of clothing busting out some moves.</p>
      <p>M&amp;S, which is the UK's biggest knitwear retailer, invites us to "Go Jumpers" in a light-hearted update for the chain.</p>
      <p>It shows off 50 jumpers from the range, with M&amp;S expecting to flog more than a whopping five million jumpers over the festive season.</p>
      <p>Clothing &amp; Home Marketing Director at M&amp;S Nathan Ansell is confident the ad will show shoppers that the chain's made some major shakeups since last holiday season.</p>

      <p>"This year our Christmas campaign really brings the changes we're making at M&amp;S in clothing to life," Nathan said, "It's all about great style and great value for the whole family.</p>
      <p>"We're backing with confidence our biggest commercial category for Christmas and importantly having some fun with out customers and colleagues.</p>
      <p>"We can't wait to see the nation Go Jumpers for Christmas."</p>
      <p>Recent changes have also seen M&amp;S adopt a more family-based approach -this has included a collaboration with Disney ahead of the release of its film Frozen 2, which is sure to be a massive hit.</p>
      <p>Its Christmas gift shops have also launched earlier than ever before thanks to shopper demand.</p>
