      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 8): Affin Hwang Capital Research has maintained its “Hold” rating on Public Bank Bhd at RM19.86 with a lower target price of RM20 (from RM23.50) and said Public Bank reported a marginal rebound in 3Q19 net profit (+2.2% q-o-q) to RM1,362.7 million.</p>
      <p>In a note today, the research house said Public Bank’s 9M19’s net earnings of RM4,105.7 million (-1.9% y-o-y) were within house and market expectations.</p>
      <p>It said there was not much excitement in the 9M19 results – due to impact of the 25 basis points (bps) OPR cut (causing 9M19 NIM to pull back 9bps y-o-y to 2.15%) and modest loan growth of 4.1% y-o-y arising from weak sentiment.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, it said NIM stabilised on a q-o-q basis at 2.12% and was expected to further normalise in the next quarter.</p>
      <p>“The group, however, posted stronger non-interest income growth of 5.8% y-o-y for 9M19 (driven by disposal gains of financial assets).</p>
      <p>“We continue to expect a subdued outlook in 2019-2021, underpinned by: i) potentially weaker-than-expected loan growth, which we have revised down to 3% for 2020-21E (from 4.5%); ii) expectation of a another rate cut in 2020, posing more downside risks to earnings; and iii) higher overheads.</p>
      <p>“Reiterate Hold, target price revised to RM20.00 from RM23.50,” it said.</p>
