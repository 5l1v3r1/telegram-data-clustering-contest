      <p><a href="https://www1.president.go.kr/petitions/583478">A Blue House petition</a> has been revealed to be in place asking to ban<b> X1</b> and<b> IZ*ONE</b> after the show became wrapped up in a voting fraud controversy. </p>
      <p>The petition was submitted on November 7 and is titled '<b>ban IZ*ONE and X1 from all terrestrial broadcasts</b>'. </p>

      <p>Part of the petition states: <i>"The debuted X1 is currently blocked from performing, but IZ*ONE is acting as if nothing happened and are preparing for a comeback. This entire situation is the program's way of mocking us. Ban these groups from appearing on terrestrial broadcasts."</i></p>
      <p>It seems like the anger is growing as recent reports revealed that the top 20 contestants of both <b>'Produce 48'</b> and<b> 'Produce X 101' </b>were chosen even before the public voting started. What do you think of this situation? </p>
