      <p>PARIS, Nov 9 — A French former model and actress yesterday accused Oscar-winning director Roman Polanski, whose new film on the persecution of French Jewish army officer Alfred Dreyfus premieres next week, of raping her in a Swiss ski resort when she was a teenager.</p>
      <p>It is the latest accusation against the 86-year-old Polish-born director who fled to France in 1978 from the US after admitting the statutory rape of a 13-year-old girl.</p>
      <p>Valentine Monnier told <i>Le Parisien</i> newspaper that the alleged rape occurred in 1975 when she was 18 at Polanski’s chalet in Gstaad.</p>
      <p>“I had no links with him, neither personal nor professional, and hardly knew him,” Monnier, a former model who worked in New York, said.</p>
      <p>She said the alleged rape was “extremely violent”, adding: “He pummelled me until I gave in and then raped me, making me do all sorts of things.” </p>
      <p>Monnier said she recounted what had happened to her that very night to two women who were also staying in Polanski’s chalet: Her best friend and another woman who became Polanski’s girlfriend for four years. </p>
      <p>Both women were contacted by <i>Le Parisien</i> and confirmed Monnier’s version.    </p>
      <p>Monnier, who acted in a few films in the 1980s, said she had finally decided to speak out as Polanski’s new film about an error of justice was due to come out.</p>
      <p>Following the Harvey Weinstein scandal Monnier said she had written letters about the alleged rape to Los Angeles police and to French first lady Brigitte Macron.</p>
      <p>Polanski’s lawyer Herve Temime said the director “firmly denies all accusations of rape,” adding that the allegations “which date back 45 years have never been reported to judicial authorities”.</p>

        <b>‘Allegations baseless’</b>
      </p>
      <p>Polanski has also been accused of sexual assault by others. In 2010, British actress Charlotte Lewis accused him of “sexually abusing” her in 1983 when she was 16.</p>
      <p>Another woman, identified only as Robin, accused him in August 2017 of sexual assault when she was 16 in 1973.</p>
      <p>In September 2017, former actress Renate Langer filed a new complaint alleging she had been raped by Polanski in 1972 when she was 15.</p>
      <p>Polanski’s lawyer said all the allegations were baseless.</p>
      <p>Polanski, who directed <i>Rosemary’s Baby</i> and <i>Chinatown</i>, was accused of drugging a 13-year-old girl before raping her at film star Jack Nicholson’s house in Los Angeles in 1977.</p>
      <p>He admitted statutory rape after a number of more serious charges were dropped, and spent 48 days in custody to undergo psychiatric evaluation before being released.</p>
      <p>In 1978, convinced a judge was going to scrap his plea deal and send him to prison for decades, Polanski fled for France and has been a fugitive from the US justice system ever since despite repeated attempts to have him extradited. — AFP</p>
