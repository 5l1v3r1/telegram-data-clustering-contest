      <p>Demonstrators in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/latin-america">Chile</a> looted a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/religion/roman-catholic">Roman Catholic</a> church Friday amid weeks of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/chile-santiago-protests-metro-fare-state-of-emergency">violent unrest</a> triggered by a proposed four-cent subway fare hike that has since evolved into larger dissatisfaction over income inequality.</p>
      <p>The hooded vandals were spotted by an Associated Press photographer dragging church pews, religious statues and iconography onto the street in the capital city of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/chile-scraps-apec-climate-summits-amid-protests">Santiago</a> and lighting them on fire.</p>

      <p>Two female police officers were set on fire Monday when <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/chile-police-molotov-cocktails-fire">Molotov cocktails</a> were thrown in their direction. Other demonstrators have thrown rocks at authorities, who have responded with water cannons and tear gas.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, Chilean President Sebastián Piñera announced tougher measures to quell the violence and stiffen penalties for vandalism in an effort to restore social order.</p>
