      <p>BERLIN, Nov 9 — Hoffenheim moved to second place in the Bundesliga yesterday as they beat Cologne 2-1 for a club record sixth straight victory in all competitions thanks to Juergen Locadia’s injury time penalty.</p>
      <p>Jhon Cordoba opened the scoring for the hosts before Sargis Adamyan and Locadia’s second half efforts lifted Alfred Schreuder two points below leaders Borussia Moenchengladbach.</p>
      <p>Schreuder made one change from last weekend’s victory over Paderborn with Stefan Posch taking Kevin Akpoguma’s place in defence.</p>
      <p>Achim Beierlorzer’s outfit remain in 17th spot with only two wins all season despite handing attacker Cordoba just his second league start of the season.</p>
      <p>Colombian Cordoba repaid the faith shown in him by the Billy Goats’ coach Beierlorzer to claim his second goal in three appearances.</p>
      <p>Attacking midfielder Louis Schaub laid-off to Cordoba at the edge of the box and the 26-year-old struck home.</p>
      <p>In-form Hoffenheim responded three minutes into the second-half.</p>
      <p>Defensive midfielder Sebastian Rudy chipped the ball to the path of Adamyan inside the penalty area and the Armenia winger side-footed on the volley to equalise.</p>
      <p>Hoffenheim’s winner came after seven minutes of additional time as Dutch youth international Locadia scored his third goal of the season with a penalty after referee Robert Kampa had checked the decision with VAR.</p>
      <p>Today’s action sees managerless Bayern Munich host Borussia Dortmund in the champions first league game since Niko Kovac was sacked last weekend’s 5-1 drubbing at Eintracht Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>League leaders Moenchegladbach welcome Werder Bremen tomorrow with French forward Marcus Thuram looking to score for a fifth straight match after netting an injury-tme winner in the Europa League against Roma midweek. — AFP</p>
