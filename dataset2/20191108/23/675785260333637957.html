      <h2>Sam says that they find going on tour mentally very strenuous and they have an on-road therapist to deal with the pressures</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T23:21:48+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 23:21</time> by <a rel="author">Will Twigger, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/will-twigger/</a></address>
      <p>Singer and Oscar-winner <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/sam-smith">Sam Smith</a> has said that they might stop touring all together because "touring is really, really difficult."</p>
      <p>Sam - who recently changed their pronouns to "they/them" - revealed that they've faced severe mental health struggles while on the road.</p>
      <p>They said: "After every tour I've been on, I've had a bit of a meltdown, if I'm honest.</p>
      <p>"I don't want to lose my mind, so I'm scared for the next tour."</p>
      <p>Sam continued: "I have an on-the-road therapist. There's many ways to handle it, but the truth is I don't handle it, I find it really hard."</p>

      <p>While they're hugely popular with their legions of fans, touring's a lonely experience for them and they miss their loved ones.</p>
      <p>Sam explained: "You go away from all your family and friends for so long and then you come back and everyone's changed and everything's changed.</p>
      <p>"You have to play catch-up, but you have to play catch-up knowing full well that you're going to go again in a year's time.</p>
      <p>"So it's really hard but at the same time it's incredibly addictive because I get to meet my fans and sing for all of them.</p>
      <p>"I travel to some incredible places and I'm doing what I love when I'm performing and the highs that you feel are incredible."</p>
      <p>Sam has been in the spotlight even more so than usual recently, as they announced their non-binary identity.</p>

      <p>Earlier this year, they did an interview with Jameela Jamil, in which the two stars discussed the topics of gender and identity.</p>
      <p>Sam said: "You do not identify in a gender.</p>
      <p>"You are just you. You are your own special creation. That is how I take it. I am not male or female. I think I float somewhere in between - somewhat on the spectrum."</p>
      <p>They added: "I've always had a bit of a war in my body and my mind...I do think like a woman in my head at time.</p>
      <p>"I've sometimes sat there and questioned, 'Do I want a sex change?' It's something I still think about, but I don't think it is.</p>
      <p>"I've tried to change that into my thoughts on gender...when I move, when I have sex with men, it's very feminine. I'm feminine in many ways - and I've resented that."</p>
