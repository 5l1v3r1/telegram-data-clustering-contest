      <p>Back in September, comedy superstar <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2479002/kevin-hart-reportedly-suffers-major-injuries-after-car-accident">Kevin Hart was caught in a serious car accident</a> and suffered “major back injuries.” Hart is still recovering, and his <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483533/jumanji-the-next-levels-final-trailer-says-goodbye-to-the-jungle"><i>Jumanji: The Next Level</i></a> costar, Nick Jonas, recently said the following about how thankful he is that Hart is on the mend:</p>
      <blockquote>I'm so relieved to hear that he's doing OK. Life is so fragile and these moments are ones to really take into account the people you love and how blessed we all are to be alive. I'm so thankful that he's still here because he's one of the best and, you know, on top of being a castmate of mine in <i>Jumanji</i>, [he's] a really great friend and great guy. So Kevin, I'm glad you're alright.</blockquote>
      <p>While Nick Jonas has not seen Kevin Hart since they finished shooting <i>Jumanji: The Next Level</i>, the former told <a href="https://www.etonline.com/nick-jonas-shares-heartfelt-message-to-friend-kevin-hart-after-car-crash-exclusive-135876">ET</a> that he’s “messaged back-and-forth” with the latter about how he’s doing. We’ll have to wait and see if Hart will be well enough to do the press rounds for <i>The Next Level</i> (<a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481903/kevin-hart-back-to-work-doing-jumanji-the-next-level-marketing-after-car-crash">he’s aiming to do so</a>), or at the bare minimum show up to the world premiere, but if he is, then count on those two catching up with one another face-to-face.</p>
      <p>Kevin Hart was sitting in the passenger seat of his 1970 Plymouth Barracuda when the driver lost control on Mulholland Highway at around 12:45 a.m. on September 1. Hart reportedly fractured his spine in three places, which required him to undergo surgery, but he was let out of the hospital ten days later and swiftly <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2480701/with-no-movies-on-his-plate-kevin-hart-in-therapy-and-grateful-to-be-alive">began physical therapy</a>.</p>
      <p>Kevin Hart is still in the midst of rehabilitation, requiring <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2479441/kevin-hart-in-serious-pain-with-months-of-recovery-ahead-leaving-movie-projects-hanging">some of his projects to be put on hold</a>, but in a video he posted at the end of October where he <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483482/kevin-hart-shares-emotional-video-about-his-accident-and-recovery">shared looks at his damaged car and the recovery process</a>, Hart seemed to be in good spirits. And Nick Jonas isn’t the only <i>Jumanji</i> actor who’s been looking out for Hart. Just days after the accident, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson cut his honeymoon short in order to <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2479216/dwayne-johnson-left-honeymoon-early-to-replace-kevin-hart-on-kelly-clarksons-talk-show">fill in for Hart on <i>The Kelly Clarkson Show</i></a>, though that didn’t stop him from <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2479506/the-rock-cant-resist-joking-about-kevin-hart-while-giving-health-update">still poking fun at his frequent collaborator</a>.</p>
      <p>Kevin Hart, Nick Jonas and the rest of the <i>Jumanji: The Next Level</i> actors finished filming their scenes back in May, so Hart’s car accident did not delay the movie’s release. It still set to <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483418/9-big-holiday-movies-hitting-theaters-around-thanksgiving-and-christmas">come out in mid-December</a>, the same weekend as movies like <i>Black Christmas</i>, <i>Bombshell</i>, <i>Richard Jewell</i> and <i>Uncut Gems</i>.</p>
      <p>While Kevin Hart and Nick Jonas are both reprising their respective <i>Welcome to the Jungle</i> avatars in <i>Jumanji: The Next Level</i>, Franklin "Mouse" Finbar and Jefferson "Seaplane" McDonough, the sequel is switching things up by having <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2475850/the-jumanji-the-next-level-trailer-turns-the-rock-into-danny-devito">most of the main characters playing as different avatars</a>. In the case of Mouse and Seaplane, Danny Glover’s Milo Walker is filling the former’s shoes and Alex Wolff’s Spencer Gilpin will play as the latter.</p>
      <p><i>Jumanji: The Next Level</i> opens in theater on December 13, and if you’re curious about what other movies are coming out before the year is over, look through our <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2456842/new-movie-releases-2019-movie-release-date-schedule">2019 release schedule</a>.</p>
