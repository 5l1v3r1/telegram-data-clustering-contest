        <i>Labour peer also strongly critical about Jeremy Corbyn and ‘thuggery’ in the party</i>
      </p>
      <p>The former home secretary <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidblunkett">David Blunkett</a> has said the “antisemitism” and “thuggery” within Labour makes him despair, compounding a difficult few days for the party.</p>
      <p>Lord Blunkett, who was an MP for 28 years before becoming a Labour peer, said the likelihood of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> winning a majority was “extraordinarily slim”.</p>
      <p>But he urged moderates within the party to “stay and fight” to ensure the “voice of reason” prevailed, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/06/tom-watson-to-quit-as-labour-deputy-leader-and-stand-down-as-mp">following deputy leader Tom Watson’s decision to stand down</a>.</p>
      <p>The former cabinet minister’s comments came after two of its former MPs urged voters to back the Tories instead. Ian Austin and John Woodcock said <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/07/former-labour-mp-ian-austin-urges-voters-back-boris-johnson">they would be supporting the Conservatives</a> as they did not believe Corbyn was fit to be in No 10.</p>
      <p>And on Friday, Dame Margaret Hodge – one of the most prominent Jewish figures in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour">Labour</a> – declined to endorse the opposition leader as prime minister.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/11/08/despair-behaviour-labours-hard-left1/">Writing in the Telegraph</a>, Blunkett said: “The behaviour of the hard left within the Labour party – the antisemitism, the thuggery, the irrational views on security and international issues, and the lack of realisation that you have to embrace a big tent of people in order to win – certainly makes me despair.</p>
      <p>“But it also makes the likelihood of an all-out Labour majority in this general election extraordinarily slim. The political landscape right now is completely different to what the hard-left would have you believe.</p>
      <p>“We are in a 1983 situation here, not a 2017 one – with not only the Lib Dems and the Greens, but the Brexit party, the Tories and the SNP all seriously vying for traditional Labour votes.”</p>
      <p>The Conservative party under Margaret Thatcher secured a sizeable majority at the 1983 election after votes for the opposition were split between Labour and the Liberal/SDP alliance.</p>
