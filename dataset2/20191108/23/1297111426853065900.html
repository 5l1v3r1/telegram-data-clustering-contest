      <h2>A Saskatoon-based Wexit organizer says plan A is challenging Premier Scott Moe to hold a referendum on separation. If he doesn't, they intend to form their own provincial party.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T23:36:48+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 23:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/awhitecrummey" target="_blank">Arthur White-Crummey</a></address>
      <p>Wexit activists are planning to launch a registration drive in Saskatchewan they hope will give them leverage when they issue an ultimatum to Premier Scott Moe.</p>
      <p>If he doesn’t agree to hold a referendum on separation in time for the next provincial election, they vow to form their own Wexit party in Saskatchewan.</p>
      <p>But they need signatures to make good on their threat, and plan to organize pop-up booths in Saskatoon and Regina to get them.</p>
      <p>Wexit — short for Western Exit — is a separatist movement that has gained mounting attention since the federal Liberals were re-elected with a minority last month. Alberta has been ground zero for the frustration-fuelled campaign, with 750 supporters packing an Edmonton hall last weekend for a Wexit rally.</p>
      <p>In Saskatchewan, the movement has remained largely in cyberspace. There hasn’t been a single post-election Wexit rally in the province, according to Wexit Saskatchewan organizer Eric Wall. But he described a core group of activists with a lengthy mailing list who are ready to take the fight to the real-world storefronts as part of a public petition campaign.</p>
      <p>“We’re trying to set up a good network here in Saskatchewan,” he said.</p>
      <p>Wall is based in Saskatoon. That’s where the movement is planning to organize its first “pop-up booths” on Nov. 24 to gather signatures. Wexit Saskatchewan announced the news on its Facebook page Friday, while seeking volunteers to staff and advertise the initiative. The first booths are slated for Princess Auto and a Canadian Tire store.</p>
      <p>Subsequent booths are planned for Regina, “pending volunteers.”</p>
      <p>The movement will need at least 2,500 signatures from Saskatchewan people to register as a provincial political party and run candidates for seats in the Legislative Assembly. But Wall said they’ll only submit the application if Moe doesn’t agree to their proposal.</p>
      <p>“Our first plan is to work with Premier Scott Moe in holding a referendum for secession,” said the Facebook post. “If Premier Scott Moe refuses, we will have no choice but to submit our application to register Wexit Saskatchewan and give the Saskatchewan People the option to elect Wexit MLAs and get the referendum question on the ballot.”</p>
      <p>When asked, Moe’s press secretary gave no indication of any plans to comply.</p>
      <p>Wall was previously involved with an unsuccessful registration initiative under the banner of Prairie Freedom Alliance, which failed to garner enough signatures and subsequently rebranded itself as a movement rather than a political party.</p>
      <p>But he thinks public opinion has changed since as separatist sentiment mounts in Saskatchewan.</p>
      <p>“We’re kind of seeing an awakening right now,” he said.</p>
      <p>In February he teamed up with Peter Downing, a Wexit organizer in Alberta. They adopted the Wexit branding in June. In Wall’s view, the new approach is more “professional” than Prairie Freedom Alliance.</p>
      <p>“It doesn’t look like amateur hour,” he said.</p>
      <p>Wall would not give a specific deadline for Moe to agree to hold a referendum, except that it will have to come before the provincial election campaign begins.</p>
      <p>He said the group is hoping to use former Reform MP and Saskatchewan Party MLA Allan Kerpan as an emissary in their bid to bring Moe onside. Kerpan has acted as a spokesman for Wexit, and Wall said he is already reaching out to Saskatchewan Party supporters.</p>
      <p>Moe has called himself a “frustrated federalist” who believes in Canada, while blaming the federal government for divisions and frustration in the West.</p>
      <p>Asked about the Wexit push on Friday, Moe’s press secretary acknowledged that the frustrations behind separatists sentiments are real and blamed them on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s policies.</p>
