      <p>The City of Regina is now owed a total of $2.3 million after filling the Capital Pointe hole.</p>
      <p>Whether that money is paid by the property owner, or the city has to undergo a number of steps to take ownership of the land remains to be seen.</p>
      <p>On Friday, the city announced its project to backfill the site was completed after 10,000 hours of work over four months and 25,568 cubic metres of dirt. Westgate Properties, the current owner of 1971 Albert Street, is now on the hook for the cost of restoring the property to a safe condition.</p>
      <p>The cost of the work to fill the hole was approximately $2 million. The city said none of the charges associated with the project were paid for by the taxpayers, as the costs have been added onto the outstanding taxes owed by the property owner.</p>
      <p>The city said it is now following regular processes to collect the money owed. If the property is sold or the owner declares bankruptcy, the city is the first creditor to be paid. The city said its administration is taking “all steps possible” to limit the financial risk to the taxpayer.</p>
      <p>If the taxes are not paid, the city can go to the Provincial Mediation Board and eventually apply to take title of the land. Legislation would then require the city to put the property up for sale.</p>
      <p>In the spring, the city placed a tax lien on the property, leaving the owner with six months before the city proceeds with tax enforcement.</p>
      <p>Deborah Bryden, the city’s director of assessment, taxation and utility billing, said the city’s first step to apply for the land title is being taken soon. Bryden would not comment on the likelihood of the taxes being paid by the property owner.</p>
      <p>“I can’t speculate as to whether or not over the next few months the taxes will be paid,” she said.</p>
      <p>The final phase of the project will now be to restore sidewalks, cover the site with recycled asphalt millings to bring the hole to ground level and install fencing. The city does not have the authority to build anything on the property, only to restore it to a safe condition. Westgate Properties is still responsible for maintaining the property, including removing debris from the land and clearing the sidewalks.</p>
      <p>Karen Gasmo, director of sustainable infrastructure, would not comment on whether the city expects Westgate to do the work of maintaining the property.</p>
      <p>“I can’t speculate what they will or won’t do,” said Gasmo, who added that the city does have bylaws in place if a property owner doesn’t follow the proper procedure.</p>
      <p>The city described the project as a “rare situation,” and that it used all available resources to address issues of site safety.</p>
      <p>The property is currently for sale through Cushman and Wakefield Realty, and is listed for $2 million.</p>
