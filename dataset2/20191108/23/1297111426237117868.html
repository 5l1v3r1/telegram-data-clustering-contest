      <h1>'One thing in common': Conference gathers families of MMIWG to share stories</h1>
      <h2>"It was the same all over again. You know, the searching, the panic, the crisis that happens when you realize that this is a serious matter."</h2>

      <p>Two days will forever be etched in Myrna LaPlante’s memory: The day her aunt went missing and the day her nephew went missing.</p>
      <p>It was the morning of Sept. 20, 2007 when LaPlante learned that her 78-year-old aunt Emily Osmond LaPlante was gone.</p>
      <p>“It was very much a shock when I received that news that morning that (my) aunt had disappeared … She just vanished,” said LaPlante, adding that her aunt lived alone in her home near Raymore, which is around 120 kilometres north of Regina.</p>
      <p>“How could she go missing from her safe rural home? And then it set in that this is a serious matter. She’s gone, she’s vanished and where could she go and who would take her and and why would they take her?”</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/18-days-or-five-years-pain-of-missing-children-overtakes-families">Less than four years later, she relived the nightmare with a second family member — Cody Ridge Wolfe.</a>
      </p>
      <p>“April 29, (2011) was the last time we saw our 17-year-old nephew. He just vanished at the Muskowekwan First Nation,” she said.</p>
      <p>“It was the same all over again. You know, the searching, the panic, the crisis that happens when you realize that this is a serious matter.”</p>

      <p>LaPlante still has no knowledge of what happened to either of her family members and said no evidence has ever been turned up in their cases, although she believes both disappearances are suspicious.</p>
      <p>In 2017, LaPlante was one of many family members who shared their stories publicly for the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG). But even with the inquiry’s report now completed and released, she felt families needed more support and further opportunity to share their stories with one another.</p>
      <p>She helped organize the Mamawe! Mekowishwewin-Miyomachowin: Being Together Gives Us Solace conference in Regina. Running Nov. 8 to 10, the event is put on by families for families and is the first of its kind in Saskatchewan.</p>
      <p>Over three days, families have an opportunity to share their stories and support one another. Attendees are also reflecting on the national inquiry and what next steps should look like in Saskatchewan.</p>
      <p>“Just because families have told their stories to the national inquiry and a report has been produced with 231 calls for justice … doesn’t mean that the healing is done,” said LaPlante.</p>
      <p>“There’s so many different stages that we’re at, but we all have the one thing in common and that is we still want to support each other and bond as a family.”</p>
      <p>Connecting with other families motivates her to continue searching for answers in her family’s cases, and find ways to help other people working through the same grief she experienced. And while sharing the story of her aunt and her nephew is never easy, LaPlante said it is one way she can honour them.</p>
      <p>“We can tell the story of Aunt and we can tell the story of Cody and you know, maybe we’ll get resolution someday in terms of what happened, but I don’t think the emotions will ever change. They’ll be with us forever,” she said.</p>
      <p>As for next steps in Saskatchewan, LaPlante said she would like to see the <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/rcmp-pledges-at-mmiw-inquiry-in-regina-to-do-better-on-indigenous-issues">province’s police agencies continue working on implementing the national inquiry’s calls for justice</a>. She said she was thankful for the work police did on her family’s cases, but that there are still ways they could “enhance their response.”</p>
      <p>She also urged residents to read the inquiry’s final report to gain a better understanding of what many Indigenous families have gone through and how Canada’s colonial history has led to so many missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls.</p>
      <p>The conference is put on in partnership with the Regina YWCA and All Nations Hope Network.</p>
