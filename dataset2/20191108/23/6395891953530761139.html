      <p><b>SANTIAGO, ChileÂ (AP)</b> - Hooded protesters in Chile looted a Roman Catholic church near the main gathering site of massive demonstrations in the capital over inequality.</p>
      <p>An Associated Press photographer on Friday witnessed vandals dragging church pews, statues of Jesus Christ and other religious iconography onto the street and lighting them on fire.</p>
      <p>Ashes spread to the main square where thousands of people continue to march, waving national flags.</p>
      <p>Some rock-throwing demonstrators have been clashing with riot police who are responding with tear gas and water cannons.</p>
      <p>The unrest began last month over a subway fare hike. But it has morphed into a movement demanding a broad range of changes.</p>
      <p>Most of the protests have been peaceful, but some have turned violent.</p>
      <p>At least 20 people have died in clashes, looting and arson.</p>
