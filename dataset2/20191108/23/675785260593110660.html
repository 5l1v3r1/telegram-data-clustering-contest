      <h2>McGregor is eyeing two bouts before fighting Nurmagomedov again - but lightweight champion has warned 'The Notorious' he must win 10 straight match-ups to face him</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T23:38:30+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 23:38</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Khabib Nurmagomedov has told Conor McGregor what he needs to do to earn a rematch for his UFC title - and it's much more than the Irishman might have anticipated.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/conor-mcgregor">McGregor</a> is set to make his long-awaited return to the octagon on January 18, having not fought since being choked out by Nurmagomedov in October last year.</p>
      <p>It has not yet been revealed who McGregor's next opponent will be, although fellow lightweights Justin Gaethje and Donald Cerrone are the among the likely contenders.</p>
      <p>After that fight, former two-weight UFC champion McGregor wants to fight Jorge Masvidal after his win against Nate Diaz at UFC 244, before rounding off 2020 with a rematch against Nurmagomedov.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/khabib-nurmagomedov">Nurmagomedov</a> has told McGregor he needs to win not two, but 10 straight bouts to earn the chance to face the Russian again.</p>

      <p>“As for a rematch, to fight for a belt in the UFC, I remember I had something like nine or 10 fights. If he wins 10 fights in a row, then that’s completely possible,” Nurmagomedov said in quotes reported by <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2019/11/ufc-khabib-nurmagomedov-rematch-conor-mcgregor-10-wins">MMA Junkie</a>.</p>
      <p>Nurmagomedov said he is in negotiations to fight Tony Ferguson next, but wants the fight to be in New York rather than the UFC’s preferred venue of Las Vegas.</p>
      <p>The UFC lightweight champion has demanded an apology over Nevada State Athletic Commission's decision to fine and suspend him for a post-fight brawl after his bout with McGregor.</p>

      <p>Nurmagomedov said: “They offered me to fight in Vegas in March, but I told them that if Vegas officially apologises for wrongly fining me for that incident on October 6, 2018, then I’ll fight there.</p>
      <p>“If not, then they can assign me to another date. As far as I know, they’re planning in April to hold (a fight card) somewhere in New York, so I’m saying I’m ready for April, or March if Las Vegas apologizes.”</p>
