        <b>Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s grandson Radwan Mujib Siddiq has told the story behind ‘Hasina: A Daughter’s Tale’, a docudrama on the unexplored bits and pieces of the life of his aunt Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The documentary drama was screened at Dhaka Lit Fest at the Bangla Academy in Dhaka on Friday.</p>

      <p>After the screening before an audience of Bangladeshi and foreign writers, poets and litterateurs, Radwan and director Piplu Khan shared their experiences from the making of the film.</p>
      <p>“She is wonderful as a human being. We see her in television, official events, award ceremonies, speeches. But in this docufilm we wanted to explore the places where the camera doesn’t follow her; her library, reading room, kitchen…,” Radwan said.</p>

      <p>“When she asked for the script during the making of the docudrama, I said there was no script. She herself, her eventful life was the script,” the son of Sheikh Rehana said.</p>
      <p>“I wanted the people to know about Sheikh Hasina’s personality by presenting her life,” he added.</p>

      <p>Piplu believes he himself knows more about Bangabandhu’s home at Dhanmondi 32 than anyone else, except Bangabandhu’s family members.</p>
      <p>“I tried to understand everything. I had rented a boat to travel to Tungipara to experience how Bangabandhu used to do it,” he said.</p>
