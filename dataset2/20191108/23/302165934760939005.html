      <p>WASHINGTON, Nov 9 — White House Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney snubbed demands by House impeachment investigators to testify yesterday, claiming immunity as a top aide to President Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>As Trump again blasted the probe as “corrupt” and a “witch hunt,” Mulvaney rejected a subpoena from the House Intelligence Committee to appear for a closed-door interview.</p>
      <p>The brush-off came days ahead of Democrats taking their impeachment investigation public with what promises to be highly contentious open hearings in Congress starting next Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The investigation has gathered evidence that Mulvaney was a key player in Trump’s alleged extortion of Ukraine to further his personal political goals.</p>
      <p>Democrats accuse the president of withholding US$391 million in military aid to pressure strategic ally Ukraine into producing damaging information on Trump’s Democratic rivals, including former vice president Joe Biden.</p>
      <p>Mulvaney, who is also acting head of the White House budget office, allegedly froze the money on Trump’s order one week before a now-infamous phone call with the president’s Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky.</p>
      <p>A summary of the July 25 conversation released by the White House showed Trump asking for investigations into Biden and into a groundless conspiracy theory that Ukraine helped the Democrats in the 2016 election.</p>
      <p>Democrats say Trump abused his office and engaged in bribery and extortion in making those demands of Zelensky.</p>
      <p>Trump has refused almost all cooperation, rejecting requests for executive branch records and banning White House staff from testifying, citing his executive privilege.</p>
      <p>“This is a scam by the Democrats who want to win an election,” he told reporters yesterday.</p>
      <p>“I would love for Mick to go up, frankly,” he said of Mulvaney. “Except one thing: It validates a corrupt investigation.”</p>
      <p>An avalanche of testimony from government officials has corroborated the allegations against Trump.</p>
      <p>Democrats plan to invite back some of the dozen officials who have given evidence in private for the open impeachment hearings to begin at the House Intelligence Committee next week.</p>
      <p>Those hearings could lead to formal charges, or articles of impeachment, being levelled against Trump by the House Judiciary Committee as early as late December.</p>
      <p>Impeachment inquiry leader Adam Schiff has warned that the White House’s refusal to cooperate will be taken as evidence of guilt and also the basis for a charge of obstructing the investigation. — AFP</p>
