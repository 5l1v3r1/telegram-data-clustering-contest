      <p>Action sports giant Boardriders was hit by a ransomware attack that affected some of its subsidiaries, including QuikSilver and Billabong, and forced the company to shut down computing systems all over the world.</p>
      <p>Boardriders has around 10,000 employees from all over the world and its Quiksilver, Billabong, ROXY, RVCA, DC Shoes, and Element brands are <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/boardriders-launches-multi-year-growth-agenda-and-repositioning-of-key-executives-300921266.html">sold</a> in over 110 countries.</p>
      <p>Following the attack, the company's e-commerce stores displayed messages offering customers 20% off promotions and stating that Boardriders is experiencing shipping delays.</p>
      <h3>Global-scale ransomware attack</h3>
      <p>Following the incident, Boardriders said in a statement to <a href="https://www.shop-eat-surf.com/2019/11/boardriders-hit-by-cyber-attack/">ShopEatSurf</a> that the attack impacted multiple systems, from several regions around the world.</p>
      <p>"Our IT teams have been working to quickly restore our systems to support our operations, which are now largely transacting and shipping normally," Boardriders also said.</p>
      <p>"We are proud of how our teams have responded to this challenge, and we are incredibly grateful for their hard work," the company added. "We also greatly appreciate our customers’ and vendors’ patience and support during this brief interruption.”</p>
      <p>While BoardRiders' statement does not detail the type of cyberattack they experienced, sources familiar with the matter told BleepingComputer that they were affected by ransomware. We were further told that this attack occurred during the last week of October 2019.</p>
      <p>"They have been in a world of pain. Staff haven’t even been able to turn on their com­put­ers and have been banned from us­ing them un­til the whole IT sys­tem is cleaned," an in­dus­try source <a href="https://www.pressreader.com/australia/the-courier-mail/20191108/281934544760904">told</a> pressreader. "There have been ma­jor de­lays in get­ting stock to re­tail­ers and on­line cus­tomers."</p>
      <p>BleepingComputer reached out to Boardriders for more details regarding the incident but did not hear back at the time of publication.</p>
      <h3>Spanish MSP and radio also attacked this week</h3>
      <p>The start of November has already seen a <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-attacks-hit-everis-and-spains-largest-radio-network/">large scale ransomware attack against Everis</a>​, one of Spain's largest managed service providers (MSP) and an NTT DATA company, which had its computers encrypted on Monday with BitPaymer.</p>
      <p>"The network has been disconnected with clients and between offices. We will keep you updated. Please, send urgently the message directly to your teams and colleagues due to standard communication problems," Everis said in an internal memo at the time.</p>
      <p>Spain's largest radio station Cadena SER (Sociedad Española de Radiodifusión) was also impacted the same day in an attack that used an unknown ransomware strain.</p>
      <p>After the attack, the radio station was forced to disconnect all of its computers from the Internet and to continue transmitting using equipment at its Madrid headquarters.</p>
      <p>Spain's Department of National Security (Departamento de Seguridad Nacional) and INCIBE (Instituto Nacional de Ciberseguridad) confirmed [<a href="http://www.dsn.gob.es/en/actualidad/sala-prensa/ciberataques-ransomware-04-noviembre-2019">1</a>, <a href="https://www.incibe.es/sala-prensa/notas-prensa/nota-informativa-ransomware-empresas">2</a>] the attack against Cadena SER.</p>
