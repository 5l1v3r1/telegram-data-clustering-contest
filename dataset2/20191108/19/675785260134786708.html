      <h1>Unai Emery claims Granit Xhaka decided not to make Arsenal return against Leicester</h1>
      <h2>The Gunners boss has already declared their trip to the King Power stadium a "must-win" fixture in the race for the top four, but they will be without their former captain</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T19:42:23+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 19:42</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/unai-emery">Unai Emery</a> has revealed it was <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/granit-xhaka">Granit Xhaka's</a> decision not to return against Leicester this weekend.</p>
      <p>The Swiss midfielder has not featured in any of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal's</a> last three matches after his outburst at Gunners fans in the clash with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> last month.</p>
      <p>Xhaka has since been stripped of the captaincy, with his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> future now hanging in the balance.</p>
      <p>And despite training all week, Emery claims that Xhaka is not in the right frame of mind for action on Saturday.</p>
      <p>When asked at a press conference whether Xhaka would be back in the squad for the trip to the King Power stadium, Emery replied: "Not yet.</p>

      <p>"I spoke with him on Tuesday about how he's feeling now and how he is in his mind.</p>
      <p>"He's working well, he's training well, but he said to me that he's not feeling good enough at the moment to play. We are going to wait."</p>
      <p>The timing of Xhaka's outburst has come at a bad time for Emery, with the Spaniard now under pressure to get a result at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> without his key midfielder, if they are to keep their top four hopes alive.</p>
      <p>Emery said: "Is this must-win? Yes. But in our mind, for each match it is only to win.</p>

      <p>“The most important is our mentality and going there thinking: ‘We are Arsenal.’ And we will go there with confidence and also strong in our mentality to be together to go to work against them."</p>
      <p>Arsenal are said to be considering selling Xhaka in January as his relationship with the club's supporters remains fractured.</p>
      <p>However they are concerned they may have to take a hit on the £30 million they paid for him in 2016, with other clubs aware of his current situation.</p>

      <p>"Granit Xhaka?" Bruce said.</p>
      <p>"Look, I was only in the job two weeks and I was linked with 42 players. So I am not going to comment on anybody else's players.</p>
      <p>"He is a very good player."</p>
