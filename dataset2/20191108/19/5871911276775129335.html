      <p>Introducing: The Finnish Name Converter</p>
      <p>Start with your unremarkable, un-Finnish name.</p>
      <p>With your first name, Cut off any letter after the 4th and duplicate the third letter of the last name. If your name now ends with a consonant, add: an A if you were born in the winter, an E if born in the spring, an I if born in the summer and an O if born in the fall.</p>
      <p>For your surname, only keep the first syllable, then if you were born in the eastern time zone, add a vowel of your choosing and “nen”. Central time zone, ad an -io, Mountain time, go with -sto, and Pacific, -la.</p>
      <p>I am Ryaane Hennio.</p>
