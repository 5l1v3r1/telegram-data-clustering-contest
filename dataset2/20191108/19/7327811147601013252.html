      <p>YORKTOWN HEIGHTS, Westchester County (WABC) -- Firefighters battled a raging fire that tore through a large home reported to be previously owned by Paolo Gucci in Westchester County early Friday morning.</p>
      <p>The fire broke out just after 6:30 a.m. and completely engulfed the home on Baptist Church Road in Yorktown Heights.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.loopnet.com/Listing/1230-Baptist-Church-Rd-Yorktown-Heights-NY/6610203/">loopnet.com</a>, the 12-acre Gucci Estate was purchased in 1980 for $4 million and was bought by the current owner seven years ago.</p>
      <p>The site lists the price as just over $1 million but also states the owner is asking for $1,699,000. The home is reported 8,000 square feet with a six-car underground garage, 2.5 acre packet for horses, a tennis court, an in-ground swimming pool with pool house, and a running water stream.</p>
      <p>The fire spread very quickly, and firefighters pumped water from that nearby pond in an effort to keep the water on the flames.</p>
