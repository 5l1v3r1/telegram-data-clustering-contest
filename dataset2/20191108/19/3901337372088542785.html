      <p>Cristiano Ronaldo was reportedly upset with Juventus boss Maurizio Sarri this week, but this was not the first time the superstar has clashed with a coach. Here are nine incidents when he was unhappy with managers.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The Juventus superstar <a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/international/categories/messi-ronaldo-neymar-watch-1/cristiano-ronaldo-unhappy-with-substitution-maurizio-sarri-explains-his-reaction/666939">was visibly upset</a> when he was taken off by Sarri in his side's 2-1 last-minute win over Lokomotiv Moscow on Wednesday, although the Italian tactician <a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/international/categories/messi-ronaldo-neymar-watch-1/cristiano-ronaldo-unhappy-with-substitution-maurizio-sarri-explains-his-reaction/666939">later downplayed the incident</a>.</p>
      <p>This was not the first time the Italian coach and his star player were of different opinions about a substitution, with the same happening in pre-season during a game against Tottenham Hotspur.</p>
      <p>Sarri is not the only manager Ronaldo has had run-ins with, with previous boss Massimiliano Allegri before him receiving the player's disapproval. After Juventus were knocked out of the UEFA Champions League by Ajax Amsterdam last season, the Portuguese forward reportedly questioned the coach's tactics. <i>Gazetta dello Sport</i> claimed at the time that Ronaldo expected a complete overhaul from the club's bosses, which might have played a role in Allegri's departure from the Turin club.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Ronaldo even clashed with Zinedine Zidane at Real Madrid over a substitution, and also questioned Rafael Benitez's training methods before the Frenchman took over.</p>
      <p>However, he developed the biggest feud with Jose Mourinho during his countryman's stint at the Santiago Bernabeu. Ronaldo and Mourinho had several disagreements, the first one taking place before they worked together. Back in 2007, the Portugal captain accused the then-Chelsea coach of not being able to admit his failures, to which Mourinho responded by calling him a "liar".</p>
      <p>It did not take long for them to be at loggerheads at Los Blancos. Ronaldo first questioned Mourinho's tactics after Real were eliminated from the Champions League by bitter rivals FC Barcelona at the semi-final stage in 2011, and things almost boiled over when they clashed in the dressing room in 2015, with Ronaldo having to be held back his teammates, according to Spanish football expert Guillem Balague.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The 34-year-old even clashed with Sir Alex Ferguson, whom he has often called a father figure. In the early days of his Manchester United career, Ronaldo was once at the end of one of Fergie's famous "hairdryer" treatments, but did not take it too well. According to Nemanja Vidic, Ronaldo, who was only 20 at the time, took the criticism personally, which resulted in the coach changing his approach towards his upcoming superstar.</p>
