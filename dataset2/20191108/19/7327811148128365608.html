      <p>Bell, who voices Anna, revealed that, after reading the movie's script, she told her kids the entire plot in an attempt to impress them.</p>
      <p>"I told them everything, and I told them, 'Just keep it a secret,' and then it occurred to me: Kids are bad secret keepers, and I might breach my contract," she said.</p>
      <p>Gad, who voices Olaf, followed by telling Kimmel that he showed his kids the movie.</p>
      <p>"I would put them to bed at night and be like, 'Remember, we don't talk about it," and they're like, 'We know," and I'm like, "Cause, you know, daddy wants you guys to keep having dinner, to be able to sleep with a roof over your head,'" he said.</p>
      <p>The cast also talked about wacky "Frozen 2" accessories, Groff's "amazing 80s jam" featured in the movie, and Menzel and Bell getting their stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.</p>
