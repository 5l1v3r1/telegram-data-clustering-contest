      <h1>Amazon no longer selling child's T-shirt that says "Daddy's Little Slut"</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T19:56:03+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 19:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/mark_frauenfelder_1" target="_blank">Mark Frauenfelder</a></address>
      <p>OnlyBabyCare will no longer be able to sell children's clothes with the phrase "Daddy's Little Slut" through the Amazon Marketplace, reports <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/08/daddys-little-slut-shirt-amazon-yanked-pulled-taken-down-uproar-backlash-baby-clothing/">TMZ</a>. Amazon removed the item from its database after people on social media said the thought the shirt was inappropriate.</p>
      <p>From TMZ:</p>
      <blockquote>The product description is pretty rich ... with OnlyBabyCare claiming the garment was suitable for "playing outside, birthday party, baby shower, baptism, wedding, baby photography, daily wear, family day."<br/><br/>At least there's no sexism when it comes to these sluts ... the manufacturer said the shirt was unisex and suitable for "little girls or boys."</blockquote>
      <p>This brings to mind the kid's overalls I saw at a store in Tokyo called "Slut":</p>
