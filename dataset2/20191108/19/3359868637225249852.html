      <p>CannaCor (Pty) Ltd is a company licensed as a prohibited drug operator. With over 50 000m2 of acquired land in Berea, Lesotho, the company will dedicate the land to the greenhouse or indoor cultivation of Cannabis. This company aims to become one of the top players in the industry, currently licensed and compliant with regulations to provide services in Canada, Europe and other global markets from this facility.</p>
      <p>The medical cannabis cultivation is a growing industry, with many countries moving towards the legalization of cannabis at some level. Through the implementation of sustainable production facilities and the expansion of aquaponic production plants, CannaCor seeks to integrate its management systems with a selection of blockchain technologies to ensure transparency, immutability and real-time tracking of processes. The company has an amazing team of experienced scientists, blockchain developers, pharmacists and engineers working daily, researching and delivering environmentally sustainable high-quality cannabis products.</p>
      <h3>What They Do</h3>
      <p>CannaCor offers a unique environmental approach to the cultivation of medicinal cannabis. Named Aquaponics, this system provided sustainability through the production process by recycling waste from fish to promote plant growth, while also using the plant itself to clean the water before it is flushed back into fish tanks. Aquaponics uses no soil at all – but it can use an alternative growing medium such as clay pebbles, pumice stones, lava rock or gravel, or the plants can simply be grown in the nutrient-rich waters coming from the fish tanks.</p>
      <p>In addition, environmental-friendly techniques are implemented in the extraction process as well, by applying supercritical CO2 to the process, ensuring that the product is free of unwanted particles and is superior quality.</p>
      <p>Medicinal cannabis has proven to be of great use for pains in pain, regulating pain, inflammation, sleep, appetite and memory, among other things. Patients find that medical cannabis from cannabis plants works better than simple medications containing cannabinoids, which is the medical cannabis act on the endocannabinoid system, a natural signaling system in the human body.</p>
      <h3>The Problem</h3>
      <p>Unfortunately, this industry faces several problems through the cultivators and selling process. Cannabis is sometimes subjected to illegal markets, where unknown parties are in charge of the production phase, endangering consumers’ health. This is a major challenge faced by pharmaceutical companies, which are actively looking to reduce the number of counterfeit products entering the market. Despite legalizing cannabis in various countries in the past few years, there is still a thriving black market that includes cannabis growers and sellers.</p>
      <h3>The Solution</h3>
      <p>Through the development of a blockchain-based platform, CannaCor offers the necessary tools in the industry to provide trustability for consumers and the safety they so desperately need. In addition, blockchain offers a cost-effective solution to the supply-chain processes, capable of providing real-time information about the production process of Cannabis, while also guaranteeing the unalterability of the product. These unique features ensure an increase in revenue and provide higher levels of transparency for the company and its customers.</p>
      <p>This will enable CannaCor to coordinate the activities required to accept raw materials, manufacture the product, test for quality, package for shipping and schedule for delivery. Furthermore, the ultimate goal of the company is to measure and capture the quality of products, production output and worker productivity to ensure the enterprise creates products that meet the highest quality standards. The cultivation life cycle will be carefully monitored, and important information will be captured at various stages in the cannabis plant’s life cycle.</p>

      <h3>CannaCor Cryptocurrency</h3>
      <p>CannaCor will hold the first medical cannabis Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in southern Africa. The CannaCor cryptocurrency will operate on the Ethereum Blockchain, a fast, decentralized</p>
      <p>and immutable blockchain to enable secure cross-border transactions between CannaCor, suppliers and the general public. Funds raised during the ICO will be used to build the cultivation facility and to develop the blockchain and its applications. The CannaCor coin has the potential to become a cryptocurrency with stable value and low volatility while retaining all the appealing features of other cryptocurrencies. The CannaCor coin can also be an effective vehicle to ensure simple and secure transactions between CannaCor, suppliers, and clients.</p>
