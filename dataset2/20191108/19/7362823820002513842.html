      <p>One lucky guy has just landed the job of every carb-lover’s dreams by becoming <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/dominos-app-fake-hostage-situation">Domino’s</a> Australia's chief <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/dominos-australia-garlic-bread">garlic bread taste-tester</a>.</p>
      <p>Brisbane mathematics student Zach Gracie has started his new role following an Australia-wide search that attracted almost 7500 applicants. The 21-year-old will work alongside Domino’s Australia's culinary and innovation chef Michael Treacy, and get to sample top-secret products while being paid $30 AUS per hour (about $20.50).</p>

      <p>Gracie’s innovative ideas, like macaroni garlic bread, “breadedict cumbergarlic” and triple-chocolate brownie garlic bread landed him the sought-after role.</p>
      <p>Treacy said it was difficult to choose just one applicant, but Gracie’s ideas were too good to pass on.</p>

      <p>“We look forward to welcoming him to Domino’s head office and getting his valuable feedback on one of our most iconic menu items.”</p>
