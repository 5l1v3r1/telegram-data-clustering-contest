      <h1>Exclusive Preview: Black Cat Annual #1</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T19:52:33+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 19:52</time> by <a rel="author">Blair Marnell</a></address>
      <p>Way back in the ’80s, Felicia Hardy and Peter Parker were inseparable lovers. However, they eventually drifted apart. Spider-Man reunited with his first love, Mary Jane, and also went on to marry her. Meanwhile, Black Cat carried a torch for Spidey that made things difficult for them. Even when Felicia returned to a life of crime, she still had feelings for her ex. Now, out of nowhere, Black Cat and Spider-Man are getting married! And that’s just in the first two pages.</p>
      <p>In Superhero Hype’s exclusive preview for <b>Black Cat Annual</b> #1, Jed MacKay is joined by artists Joey Vazquez, Natacha Bustos, and Juan Gedeon as they reveal why Spidey is marrying Felicia. Naturally, the cover image was just a distraction, much like the wedding itself. The real story is about what comes after, because Felicia has a plan. And she needs Spider-Man’s help to pull it off.</p>
