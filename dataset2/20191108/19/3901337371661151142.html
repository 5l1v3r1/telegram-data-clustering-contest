      </p>
      <p>The match is set to get underway at 20h00.</p>
      <p>The Team of Choice will be looking to regain their form after a goalless draw with Orlando Pirates on Tuesday, which ended their three-game winning run in the league. As a result, Eric Tinkler’s troops were left lying tenth on the table with 12 points from nine matches.</p>
      <p>United will be without the injured Phumlani Ntshangase and midfielder Kwanda Mngonyama, who was sent off against Piraes.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Siwelele will be seeking momentum after their 3-1 victory over Highlands Park on Tuesday ended a three-game winless streak.</p>
      <p>Lehlohonolo Seema’s charges went up to ninth on the table after the morale-boosting win over the Lions of the North, with the same number of points as Maritzburg and the winner will dislodge Polokwane City of eighth spot on the log, while a draw for Celtic will also be enough to enter the top half of the table.</p>
      <p>The Team of Choice have won the last four meetings between the sides in all competitions, including a league double over Siwelele last season.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Here's how they line up:</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Maritzburg:</b> 31. Ofori, 25. Xulu, 5. Morgan, 3. Sanoka, 23. De Reuck, 15. Timm, 8. Buchanan, 12. Nyoni, Lea'Alafa, 7. Kutumela, 11. Brockie.</p>
