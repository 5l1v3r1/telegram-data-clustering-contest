      <p>A deer that somehow found itself drifting out to sea had a lucky escape as it was picked up by a crew of lobstermen five miles from land.</p>
      <p>Ren Dorr was setting traps with his crew off the coast of Maine when he spotted the unusual sight on Monday.</p>
      <p>“Found this little guy 5 miles offshore today drifting farther away from land,” Mr Dorr said in a Facebook post. “Couldn’t let the poor guy suffer and drown so we brought him aboard and sailed him half hour to land and dropped him off on the beach!”</p>

      <p>Mr Dorr and his crewmates, Shawn Dowlingand Jared Thaxter, used a fishing gaff – a pole with a hook on the end – to grip the young stag’s antler and managed to haul him on to the deck of the boat.</p>
      <p>“He laid right down like a dog. He was beat out, shaking, shivering. I’m sure he was froze,” Mr Dorr told the Bangor Daily News.</p>
      <p>The crew then sailed around an hour and a half to the nearest town, Harrington.</p>

      <p>They dropped him as close to the shore as they could and watched him swim the rest of the way to land, before heading towards to the woods.</p>
      <p>“He was gonna die, 100%,” Mr Dorr said. “There’s no ifs, ands or buts — he was a goner. I couldn’t have that on my conscience, obviously. That’s not the guy that I am, so I figured I’d bring him in.”</p>
