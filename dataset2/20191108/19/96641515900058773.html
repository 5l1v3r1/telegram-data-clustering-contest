      <h1>Facebook, YouTube delete posts claiming to name Ukraine whistleblower</h1>
      <h2>Twitter, so far, is not.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T19:44:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 19:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.facebook.com/richard.lawler" target="_blank">Richard Lawler</a></address>
      <p>There's an <a href="https://apnews.com/Trumpimpeachmentinquiry">impeachment inquiry</a> taking place against Donald Trump, which started with a whistleblower complaint about conduct on a call with officials in the Ukraine. Outlets like Breitbart have published content claiming to name the person who initially filed the complaint claiming the president violated his oath of office.</p>
      <p>Now the latest free speech flashpoint for social networks is whether or not to allow the spread and amplification of the name, while lawyers for the whistleblower argue that publishing a potential name puts that person at risk. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/08/tech/facebook-whistleblower-name/index.html"><i>CNN</i></a> reports that Facebook and YouTube have decided to remove posts with the name, while Twitter -- where US House Rep. Matt Gaetz and Donald Trump Jr. <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanhatesthis/trumps-allies-have-been-attacking-the-person-they-say-is">have shared posts with the name</a> -- says it is not against the rules. With public hearings on the matter scheduled to start next week, this is unlikely to go away anytime soon.</p>
