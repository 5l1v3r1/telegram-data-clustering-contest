      <p>MUZAFFARGARH (Dunya News) – Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto on Friday has said that his father and former President Asif Ali Zardari is not being allowed to have medical treatment from private doctors.</p>
      <p>Addressing a rally in Muzaffargarh, the PPP chief said that Prime Minister (PM) Imran Khan has destroyed the economy of the country. I had pledged to support the premier if he fulfills his promises, he added.</p>
      <p>The PPP chief further said that the government is full of ‘selected and incompetent’ people who are inhumanly treating the general masses. Not a single political party has accepted the results of the elections 2018, he went on to say.</p>
      <p>Bilawal Bhutto said that only poverty, unemployment and inflation have increased during the tenure of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government. <br/><br/>Our government had made all the provinces autonomous under 18th amendment. We had introduced Benazir Income Support Program for the welfare of poverty-stricken people, he asserted.</p>
      <p>The PPP chief further told that he had faced difficulties in running his election campaign. I had told the people that a ‘puppet government’ was given charge of the country, he concluded.  </p>
