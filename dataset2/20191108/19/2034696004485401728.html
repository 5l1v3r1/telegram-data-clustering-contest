      <p>The rapper made a surprise appearance at the fifth annual Fast Company Innovation festival in New York yesterday (November 7), where he spoke with Yeezy footwear designer Steven Smith, according to the <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/christian-genius-billionaire-kanye-west-talks-2024-presidential-candidacy-moving-yeezy-stateside-1253358">Hollywood Reporter</a>.</p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/kanye-west-jesus-is-king-review">four-star review of ‘Jesus Is King’</a>, <i>NME</i> said: “Like many great rock stars before him, Kanye West has cranked up God’s jukebox. ‘Jesus Is King’ lacks his trademark goofball sense of humour, but that’s partly compensated for with warmth and hope for the future.”</p>
