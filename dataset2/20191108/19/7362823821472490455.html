      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/chrissy-teigen">Chrissy Teigen</a> is apologizing to her social media followers after the model and TV host made a joke about her mother, Vilailuck, that didn’t go over well.</p>
      <p>"My mom treats her air pods like they're disposable. Buys a few a month. She says they would be easier to not lose if they had ... a cord," Teigen tweeted on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>It wasn't long after before Twitter users began criticizing Teigen, 33, for flaunting her family’s wealth, considering a new pair of Apple’s AirPods are about $150 and the company’s AirPods Pro are a cool $250.</p>

      <p>"Oh man, I haven’t checked my mentions for a bit and I didn’t realize how many people were super pissed off about this," the “Cravings” cookbook author replied to the tweet. "It was meant as a joke (and exaggeration) about how my mom doesn’t realize air pods are with a cord are headphones but it came across as super tone deaf and icky."</p>

      <p>“It's not about how you said it. It's the fact that some people are starving while others can treat $150 airpods as disposable,” the user wrote. “I love you Chrissy but seriously, stop pretending this is about tone and start campaigning for wealth redistribution.”</p>
      <p>"You keep saying this as if my husband and I don’t do anything for society and it’s really disheartening," Teigen said of her and her husband, John Legend. "It was a comment, a joke, a dumb one at that, that I’m sorry for. I hope we have done and continue to do things that contribute more than a dumb tweet. Again, I apologize."</p>

      <p>The mother of two replied to another commenter, writing, "I don’t ever forget people are struggling. All I can do is tangible things to help make a difference outside the twitter world. It definitely showed that I’m a bit removed and I will do better as best I can."</p>
