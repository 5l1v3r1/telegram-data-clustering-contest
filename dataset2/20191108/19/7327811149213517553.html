      <p>Brown now believes "extra lemon" was code for marijuana, since he found three bags of weed in his cup. He says he only realized it once he was "high as a kite."</p>
      <p>Brown says he'd never had marijuana, so he didn't recognize the taste. He says he paid regular price for the items.</p>

      <p>A representative for McDonald's said the company is "fully cooperating with law enforcement on the validity of this claim."</p>
