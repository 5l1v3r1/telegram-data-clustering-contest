      <p>THE buyout offer for Catalist-listed DLF Holdings closed on Friday at 5.30pm, with valid acceptances amounting to 6.98 per cent of total issued shares received by the close.</p>
      <p>This brings the total number of shares acquired by offeror QRC Pte Ltd to approximately 64.13 per cent.</p>
      <p>QRC's mandatory takeover offer for the mechanical and electrical engineering services firm was triggered when it entered into an agreement to acquire a 57.16 per cent stake in the company for S$0.0809 per share. It then offered S$0.081 for each share that it did not already own.</p>
      <p>The offeror has indicated that it intends to carry on DLF's existing business and maintain its listing status.</p>
      <p>QRC was locally incorporated in 2018. The entity's directors include its owner and individuals Mishima Yusaku and Zhang Congxi.</p>
      <p>DLF shares closed unchanged at S$0.185 on Friday.</p>
