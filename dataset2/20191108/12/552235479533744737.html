      <p>A Dumbarton couple are staging a free children’s festive show in true Christmas spirit for youngsters across the area.</p>
      <p>David and Jennifer Clarke have created a fun panto-style performance called Santa and the Heebie Jeebies, which kicks off later this month.</p>
      <p>They have launched business Lost Entertainment and have decided to offer their first show for free for disadvantaged children.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>David said: “We are putting on a series of Christmas shows at the Denny Civic Theatre in Dumbarton.</p>
      <p>“We are a local family and have struggled to make ends meet for long enough and have really pushed ourselves to the limits to start our own business and put this show together.</p>
      <p>“We have decided to invite the children and their families from Robin House to join us free of charge.</p>
      <p>“We’ve also reached out to the women’s refuge in the hope that any young families their who would like to join us can.</p>
      <p>“We have a seven-year-old daughter and it’s heartbreaking as a parent to hear about other children going through difficulties.</p>
      <p>“We really wanted to give something back and offer them a nice afternoon out.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The Christmas show is based around a story David wrote for his daughter Emily, who is pictured above and will also star in the show, called The Heebie Jeebie.</p>
      <p>He has given a whole new take on the phrase ‘heebie jeebies’, typically used to describe a particular type of nervousness.</p>
      <p>David explained: “The original story is based on the Scottish saying, when something gives you the ‘heebie jeebies’.</p>
      <p>“The story is that heebie jeebies are actually little creatures who come and fix broken things. The idea is that they are not scary at all and are doing good things so it has a moral undertone to it.</p>
      <p>“Actor Ian Sexon, who is known for doing voiceovers, will be playing a big role and he has adapted the story for the show.</p>
      <p>“It will be very much a panto-style show with slapstick humour. Kids will really enjoy it.”</p>
      <p>David and Jennifer are planning to bring more children’s shows to the Dumbarton area.</p>
      <p>He added: “I used to work at the fair when I was a kid and I’ve always enjoyed that kind of thing. I worked long hours as a crane operator for 15 years and missed out on time with my family so I decided to start up my own business and thought this would be the perfect opportunity.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“It’s important to us that the first show we stage is free to children and their families.”</p>
      <p>The free show will take place on Sunday, November 24 and two more will take place that day too. More shows will take place on December 8, December 15 and December 22.</p>
