      <h1>Uzair Jaswal and Momina Mustehsan's new song will slowly but surely grow on you</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T12:40:22+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 12:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/5607/entertainment-desk/" target="_blank">Entertainment Desk</a></address>
      <p>A ting of love, a spoon full of melodies and a whirlpool of emotions, <i>Hamesha</i> is one of those songs that hits slowly but stays for sure. Being Uzair Jaswal and Momina Mustehsan’s brainchild, it appears to have turned out well, given the lyrics seem to be well connected with the storyline, along with the choice of sound structuring.</p>
      <p>The duo also seems to have reached a mutual consensus on the key they should be singing in and how that would compliment the other. However, the song lacks that magical uniqueness required to make one hooked onto it.</p>

      <p>The narrative seems to have been crafted quite intellectually but a lot of information mixes up along the way. However, the concept has made its way across, holding onto an old-school but contemporary touch, with Uzair and Momina playing a couple that works at a diner.</p>
      <p>As requested by Momina at the beginning of the song, Uzair pens down their story which takes a visual turn as the two begin imagining a lavish life together. The two seem to have taken on the roles of being both the protagonist and the antagonist in the video, with Momina 2 killing Uzair 1 in the end while robbing the diner, but feeling sorry about it later.</p>
      <p>However, the song is a mellow track which may prompt one to stroll down the memory lane on a cold winter night, or allow them to sleep better. Whichever the case, it has landed itself among some of the most decently composed and somber pop tracks of today’s day and age, providing motivation for more original music to hit the market, while being good enough to make others, at the least, try.</p>
