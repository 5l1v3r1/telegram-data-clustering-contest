      <h1>Aa Drushya movie review: Ravichandran's parade of characters fill up the narrative in overall story</h1>

      <p><i>Yours faithfully</i> <br/><br/>In his heydays, Ravichandran remade romantic films in Kannada that, as Sandalwood sayings go, were better than the originals. Each one was a musical. So a film in which he has no love interest, no duets, romantic lines, no grapes, ribbons and candles goes against the grain. Drishya was the turning point and Aa Drushya the latest. One thing that has not changed is the remake angle. This is a "yours faithfully' re-rendering of Tamil film Dhruvangal Pathinaaru. There is no additional Ravichandran touch as he is only the actor here. Shiva Ganesh is a great competition to MD Sridhar and Co. <br/><br/>A police officer leading a prematurely retired life is visited by a colleague's son. The colleague wants his son to be weaned away from the idea of a cop's life. The friend's son shows a more than curious interest in the cop's last case that ended his career. He narrates what he has learnt about it. The cop then adds his version of what happened. The characters in the flashback too bring new additions. The audience are treated to a layered entertainment with each retelling. The mystery grows till the very end. Nothing is as simple as when it started. <br/><br/>It is easy to lose track of the plot when there are unnecessary subplots or songs in such a film. They are dispensed with. Even humour and sentiments are strictly through dialogues only. Even in such a tight narrative, the personalities of the characters seep through. All credit to the attention given to details. <br/><br/>Ravichandran seems to have done the film in two different moods. The flashback as the active cop looks half-hearted in places. The wig is bad. As the grayed retired cop recalling the case, he is brilliant. The body language, modulation and mannerism is perfect. A parade of characters fill up the narrative, each one an important cog in the overall story. The director manages to bring out the actor in each of them. <br/><br/>Aa Drushya is as entertaining as it is engaging. Not really an edge-of-the-seat experience but an engrossing 'what happened?' tale.</p>
