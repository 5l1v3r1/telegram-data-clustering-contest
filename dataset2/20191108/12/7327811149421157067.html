      <p>GREENPOINT, Brooklyn (WABC) -- A three-alarm fire burned through a large warehouse in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn early Friday.</p>
      <p>The fire broke out in a warehouse housing a woodworking business on Van Dam Street at around 2:30 a.m.</p>
      <p>Firefighters were forced to battle the blaze from outside as the roof began to sag making the building unsafe.</p>
      <p>"It was a heavy body of fire on arrival, with the deterioration of the roof, so we had to withdraw our people and perform a defensive operation from the exterior," said Wayne Cartwright, FDNY Assistant Chief of Operations.</p>
      <p>Some 138 firefighters and EMS responded to the scene and are now monitoring hot spots.</p>
      <p>No one was injured.</p>
      <p>Despite the unseasonably cold temperatures and the wind conditions, officials said it did not hinder their firefighting efforts.</p>
      <p>"Right now the wind is not an operational problem," Cartwright said.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, the fire was contained to one business.</p>
