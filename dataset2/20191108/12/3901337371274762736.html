      <p>Some fashion-conscious footballers today did not always get it right when it came to stringing outfits together at first, and this could well have been the case for Orlando Pirates star Gabadinho Mhango. Check it out!</p>

      <p>Playing an eye-catching style of football on the pitch, it's off the field where Mhango has made great strides as far as his fashion sense is concerned.</p>
      <p>In his younger days, the Bucs man was into his durags, a fashion accessory many American rappers used to wear throughout the 1990s as part of their persona.</p>
      <p>These days, however, Mhango has ditched the straight peak caps for the more gentleman-like tailored fits and high fashion brands.</p>
