      <h2>Ricardo Matias Legrato, 28, fell 40-metres when the upper section of the deteriorating antenna gave way sending him and another worker hurling towards the ground.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T12:30:38+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 12:30</time> by <a rel="author">Ana Lacasa, Lila Randall</a></address>
      <p>This is the horrific moment a worker who was dismantling a 190ft antenna plummeted to his death after the metal structure collapsed.</p>
      <p>Ricardo Matias Legrato, 28, fell 131ft after the upper section of the antenna gave way, sending him and another worker hurling towards the ground.</p>
      <p>Mr Legrato was working for OSE Uruguay, a sewage and water sanitation company, in the city of Rocha, in the east of Uruguay, before he died.</p>
      <p>Footage of the incident shows the two men clinging to the antenna when the metal at the top of the structure appears to snap off.</p>
      <p>Shortly after, the metal where the men are poised erodes and crashes to the ground with the men still holding on.</p>

      <p>The second worker - along with a third waiting at the bottom of the antenna - was injured in the incident.</p>
      <p>The antenna fell onto a nursery which was empty because it was a Sunday and no further injuries have been reported.</p>
      <p>Condolences poured in for the family and friends of Mr Legrato.</p>
      <p>One person sent ‘light to the family suffering this dark path’.</p>
      <p>While other well-wishers shared their prayers for the family, sending strength and hope for the recovery of the colleagues and family members.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the health and safety precautions sparked outrage among social media users who said the men should never have been working in such precarious conditions.</p>

      <p>One person queried why OSE did not have safety nets in place to break the fall of workers in the case of an antenna breaking.</p>
      <p>According to local media reports, the workers had basic safety systems in place at the time of the accident.</p>
      <p>However, an investigation from the general inspection of Work and Social Security of the Ministry of Work and Social Security showed "serious and several irregularities" in the operation.</p>
      <p>The company will have to explain these alleged irregularities, according to the Ministry.</p>
      <p>The Uruguayan authorities are investigating the case and have asked State Sewage &amp; Water Works (OSE) who own the antenna for an explanation.</p>
