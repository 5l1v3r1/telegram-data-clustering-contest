      <p>Masked men have attacked anti-government protesters in the Iraqi city of Basra, killing five and wounding scores more, state TV and medical officials said.</p>
      <p>The shooting in the southern city occurred at around midnight and wounded around 120 people, according to medical officials.</p>
      <p>Tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets since last month in Baghdad and across the largely Shiite south to demand sweeping political change.</p>

      <p>In the capital on Friday, state television said explosives experts detonated a bomb under a bridge that has been a daily flashpoint between security forces and protesters trying to force their way into the heavily fortified Green Zone, which hosts the government’s headquarters.</p>
      <p>The report gave no further details about the controlled detonation under Sinak bridge over the Tigris River that cuts through the capital city.</p>
      <p>Also on Friday, protester Amir Shami said security forces tore down tents at an protest sit-in in the holy city of Karbala.</p>
      <p>More than 250 people have been killed since the unrest erupted on October 1.</p>
      <p>Demonstrators complain of widespread corruption, lack of job opportunities and poor basic services, including regular power cuts despite Iraq’s vast oil reserves.</p>
