      <p>This cashback card takes a different spin on how to earn the rewards. While every other card on this list earns solely by spending on your card, this card earns two different ways. You can get 2% on every purchase with unlimited 1% cashback when you buy, plus an additional 1% as you pay for those purchases. In order to earn cashback, you must pay at least the minimum due on time. This can be a great option if you want to give yourself a little incentive to pay back your holiday shopping as quickly as possible.</p>

      <p>While the other cards mentioned in this article earn more on general purchases, this card has such a good welcome bonus that we had to include it. You can grab a $250 statement credit after you spend $1,000 in purchases on your new Card within the first 3 months, an easy feat for anyone putting their holiday and regular shopping on this card. You'll also earn 1% cashback on every purchase you make and, for American Express customers, you might be able to snag even more rewards through Amex Offers. Outside of that, American Express has upped the rewards on this card, adding in 6% Cash Back on select U.S. streaming subscriptions, 3% Cash Back on transit, 6% Cash Back at U.S. supermarkets on up to $6,000 per year in purchases (then 1%), and 3% Cash Back at U.S. gas stations. You can also finance your holiday shopping by using an intro APR of 0% for 12 months on purchases (then a variable rate, currently 14.74% to 25.74%). This card does charge a $95 annual fee.</p>

      <p>There are of course a ton of other credit cards out there that earn more specific rewards with certain merchants, so if you plan to do all of your shopping at one store, see what kinds of cards would earn you the most there. However, if your shopping will take you across a number of different places, then one of these cards will certainly help you earn no matter where you end up this Black Friday.</p>
