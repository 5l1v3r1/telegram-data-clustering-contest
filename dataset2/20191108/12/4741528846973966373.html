      <h1>FG orders NIPOST to stop cash transactions </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T12:19:31+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 12:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://nairametrics.com/author/chidinma-nwagbara/" target="_blank">Chidinma Nwagbara</a></address>
      <p>The Federal Government has instructed the <b>Nigerian Postal Service</b> (NIPOST) to stop cash collection in all its offices located across the country. This instruction was given by Dr Isa Pantami, Minister of Communications and Digital Economy.</p>
      <p><b>Why the order?</b> According to a statement issued by Pantami’s spokesperson, Uwa Suleiman, it was discovered that using cash payment was aiding corrupt practices.</p>
      <p><b>The Minister said the corrupt practices</b> must be stopped in line with the <a href="https://punchng.com/fg-bars-cash-transaction-in-post-offices/">anti-corruption agenda</a> of President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration.</p>

        <i>“It has come to the attention of the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Pantami, that some unscrupulous elements have been taking undue advantage of the cash payment system under the Nigeria Postal Services to engage in corrupt practices.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>“In line with the anti-corruption agenda of President Muhammadu Buhari, and the mandate of the Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy, the minister hereby directs the Post Master General, to, with immediate effect, suspend all existing cash payment plans within its establishments nationwide,”</i> the statement read.</p>

      <p><b>Suleiman disclosed that</b> the Postmaster-General (PMG), Adebisi Adegbuyi, was directed to ensure that all NIPOST offices migrate immediately to Point of Sales and bank teller transactions. In this light, members of the public and customers of NIPOST have also been urged to insist on using PoS or bank teller transactions when conducting business with NIPOST.</p>
      <p><b>In addition</b>, Pantami ordered the PMG to immediately implement strategies that would end unnecessary delays in NIPOST’s service to customers. He said that his office would not allow the current trend of delays in postal services.</p>
      <p><b>Meanwhile, last month</b>, Adegbuyi made known that the service was trying its best to get rid of corrupt officers who tampered with people’s packages. This followed the report of a customer who accused a NIPOST official of tampering with a package sent in from America.</p>
