      <p>Pangolins are under threat from illegal trafficking networks, conservationists said on Wednesday, as they urged southern African countries to step up protection of one of the world's most smuggled mammals.</p>
      <p>Around 100 000 pangolins are plucked from the wild each year in Africa and Asia, according to conservation group WildAid.</p>
      <p>The flesh of these endangered scaled mammals is considered a delicacy in China and Vietnam, where their bones and blood are also used for traditional medicine.</p>
      <p>Demand for pangolin scales exploded over the past decade, with seizures rising from 21 kilogrammes in 2011 (Â£56) to 68 000 kilogrammes this year, says WildAid.</p>
      <p>That trade became illegal when pangolins were placed under full protection from international trade by the wild fauna and flora CITES convention in 2016.</p>
      <p>But an EU-funded research project has found that criminal gangs have since tapped into the industry.</p>
      <p>"It is vital that we understand and prevent the illicit trade in pangolins before it is too late," said researcher Richard Chelin in a statement on Wednesday.</p>
      <blockquote><a href="https://www.news24.com/Green/News/shiny-shy-and-solitary-why-pangolins-are-in-peril-20190515">Shiny, shy and solitary: Why pangolins are in peril</a>Pangolins are considered to be a highly endangered species and is the world's most trafficked mammal. It has the highest protection status of any endangered species in SA, including the rhino and elephant.</blockquote>
      <p>He added that strategies to combat illegal wildlife trafficking had focused mainly on iconic species such as elephants and rhinos, at the expense of lesser-known animals such as pangolins.</p>
      <p>"The threat to the rhino shows that early interventions are better than reactive measures at the height of a crisis," said Chelin.</p>
      <p>Southern Africa remains the only region with a reasonably healthy pangolin population.</p>
      <p>Conservationists are lobbying the government to do more to protect the species.</p>
      <p>"A small fine or a few days in jail is not a deterrent for organised criminals in a high-value industry," said South Africa environmental inspector Fanie Masango.</p>
      <p>While hunting elephant and rhino in South Africa can lead to a R100 000 fine and a ten-year prison sentence, a pangolin hunter can get away with R1 500.</p>
