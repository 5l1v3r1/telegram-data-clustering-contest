        <b>Pakistan’s fielding has been their major concern lately and the inclusion of younger and fitter players haven’t helped the cause. In the final T20 of the series, after posting a timid total of 106, Pakistan dropped Warner twice in the first over, leaving Mohammad Amir frustrated.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It was a terrible day for Pakistan in the field as they failed miserably to level the T20 series. Having posted a timid total of 106 courtesy a gritty 45 from Iftikhar Ahmed, Pakistan had an awful start with the ball. After <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/mohammad_amir">Mohammad Amir</a> had <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/david_warner">David Warner</a> cornered up with two great balls, Warner top-edged the third ball which just went over for a six. </p>
      <p>Youngster Mohammad Hasnain who was posted at third was wandering almost a good 5-6 yard in instead of patrolling the boundaries as a result what should have been a sister has gone over for six. The bowler was seen clearly disappointed by the careless attitude of the youngster but couldn’t do more than curse himself and his fate.</p>
      <p>As if the one missed opportunity wasn’t enough, Imam-ul-Haq missed another. After spectacularly stopping a crispy cut, Imam had all the time in the world to hit the stumps. But with Warner almost halfway down the pitch, who had taken off believing he beat the man, Imam missed the stumps as the opportunity went begging. </p>
      <p>Warner went on to score an unbeaten 48 off 35 as Australia sealed the series. While <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/steven_smith">Steven Smith</a> was awarded the man of the series, <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/sean_abbott">Sean Abbott</a> was adjudged as the man of the match for his brilliant spell of 2 for 14.</p>
      <p>Australia handed Pakistan a humiliating 10 wicket defeat as they sealed the series 2-0. Aussie skipper <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/aaron_finch">Aaron Finch</a>, 52 off 36 balls, was the hero with the bat while <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/kane_richardson">Kane Richardson</a> bagged three wickets to wreak havoc in the Pakistan batting line up.</p>
