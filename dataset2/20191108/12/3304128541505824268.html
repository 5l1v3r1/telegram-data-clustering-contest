      <p>A family in Nairobi is crying out for justice after their kin died last weekend after he was reportedly ran over by a car in the newly-elected Kibra Member of Parliament Imran Okoth’s campaign convoy.</p>
      <p>The man identified as Nelson Chesoni died on Sunday evening a few hours after the accident along Mbagathi Way near Highrise.</p>
      <p>Reports indicate Mzee Chesoni, who left home at around 11am, was first knocked down by a Boda Boda operator before he was run over by a white vehicle that was part of the Imran campaign convoy. The car sped off after the accident.</p>
      <p>A tweep identified as Brenda Wambui stated that the incident happened at around 12pm.</p>
      <p>The people who rushed to the scene of the accident are said to have attempted to stop Imran but in vain. He reportedly waved and continued with the journey.</p>

      <p>Chesoni was rushed to Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) and later transferred to Nairobi Hospital where he succumbed to the injuries.</p>
      <p>His legs and arms were broken. He also suffered broken ribs and multiple skull fracture.</p>
      <p>“The car is dented from the hit and run. The boda guy abandoned his boda and ran off (sic), ” said Ms Wambui in a tweet dated Sunday, November 3.</p>

      <p>Efforts to trace the car have not been successful.</p>
      <p>Kenyan Human Rights Activist Boniface Mwangi on Friday took to Twitter to call on Imran to help the family of the deceased get justice.</p>

      <p>“Congratulations Imran Okoth on your win. Now help us find the white vehicle in your campaign team that killed my neighbour, Mzee Chesoni. A gentle soul that was loved by all of us in our hood. He loved his daily walks and he was hit and left for dead along Mbagathi, ” said Mwangi.</p>

      <p>The man, who was identified as Nick Odhiambo, was hanging on a moving Toyota Prado when he fell off and was ran over by other speeding cars in the convoy.</p>
      <p>The ODM party didn’t comment on the accident.</p>
      <p>Imran’s last week campaign was held at Woodley Ground in Kibra Constituency where thousands of supporters joined ODM leaders to campaign for its candidate.</p>
      <p>The by-election of the hotly contested parliamentary seat happened yesterday.</p>
      <p>Okoth floored 24 candidates, garnering 24,636 votes with his closest rival, Jubilee Party’s McDonald Mariga coming in second with 11,230 votes.</p>
