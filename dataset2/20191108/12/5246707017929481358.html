      <h1>Reminder: The £200 Capcom Home Arcade System Launches Today, Have A New Trailer</h1>
      <h2>What is this “Death Stranding” of which you speak?</h2>

      <p>Even though it’s not a Nintendo game, we imagine that many of you reading this will be aware that today sees the arrival of Hideo Kojima’s much-hyped epic, <b><a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/death_stranding">Death Stranding</a></b> – which, according to our friends over at Push Square, is rather good. <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/death_stranding">10/10 good</a>, in fact.</p>
      <p>However, today <i>also</i> sees the release of the <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/04/capcom_home_arcade_is_a_plug-and-play_arcade_stick_but_is_the_emulation_legit">Capcom Home Arcade</a> system, Koch Media’s officially-licensed take on the whole ‘micro-console’ concept popularised by the <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2016/11/hardware_review_nes_classic_mini_nintendo_entertainment_system">NES</a> and <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2017/09/hardware_review_the_snes_classic_mini_is_the_perfect_link_to_the_past">SNES</a> Classic Editions. To celebrate this fact, Koch has created a special launch trailer which shows a father attempting to pass down his love of classic games to his offspring.</p>
      <p>Costing a whopping £200, this massive two-player joystick comes pre-loaded with 16 CPS-based arcade titles, including Capcom favourites such as <b>Street Fighter II, Ghouls ‘n Ghosts</b> and <b>Final Fight</b> – all of which will be instantly familiar to those old enough to remember the glory days of the SNES, a console that was well-supported by Capcom back in the day. However, for serious fans, the news that <b>Progear</b> and <b>Aliens vs. Predator</b> are <i>also</i> included – two games which have never been officially available outside of the arcade – is the real draw here.</p>
      <p>We reviewed the <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/hardware_review_capcom_home_arcade_is_the_most_ludicrous_micro-console_yet_and_were_in_love">Capcom Home Arcade</a> last week and said: “while the Capcom Home Arcade is very much a niche proposition, the small sector of the market it's aimed at will absolutely lap it up.”</p>
