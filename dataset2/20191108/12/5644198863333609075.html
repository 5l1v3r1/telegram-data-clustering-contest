      <p>Ibrahimovic played for Milan between 2010 and 2012, scoring 42 goals in 61 league appearances, and Garber said he was on his way back to Serie A.</p>
      <p>"Zlatan is such an interesting guy," he told ESPN. "He keeps my hands full and my inbox full, but he's a thrill-a-minute.</p>
      <p>"He is a 38-year-old guy who is being recruited by AC Milan, one of the top clubs in the world."</p>
      <p>Ibrahamovic was named in the MLS Best XI in 2018 and 2019 after netting 53 goals in the competition.</p>
      <p>His season with Galaxy ended after they suffered a 5-3 defeat by local rivals Los Angeles Football Club in the MLS Cup Western Conference semi-finals last month.</p>
