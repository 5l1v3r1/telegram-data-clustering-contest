      <h1>BMW G 310 R, G 310 GS receive over 600 bookings in October</h1>

      <p>The G 310 R naked and the G 310 GS adventure bike are priced at Rs 2.99 lakh and Rs 3.49 lakh, respectively.</p>
      <p>BMW Motorrad has reported that it has received over 600 bookings for the G 310 twins – the G 310 R and the G 310 GS – during the festive period of Navratri, Dussehra and Diwali in October. The bikes, priced at Rs 2.99 lakh (G 310 R) and Rs 3.49 lakh (G 310 GS) (both prices, ex-showroom, India), are two of the German manufacturer’s most affordable models, and an entry into its two-wheeler world.</p>
      <p>The duo are powered by a 313cc, liquid-cooled, single-cylinder unit that churns out 34hp of power and 28Nm of torque. Since their launch last year, the G 310s haven’t received any significant updates, apart from the addition of some new colour schemes. If the bikes are to stay in the market, they will need to receive an updated engine to comply with the upcoming BS6 norms. </p>
      <p>Rudratej Singh, president and CEO, BMW Group India, said, “BMW Motorrad has an extremely aspirational and distinguished set of products that have gained immense popularity and trust amongst the motorcycling community in India. Together with highly competitive cost of ownership and steadily expanding outreach throughout the country, BMW Motorrad has created a very strong position for itself in the premium motorcycle segment."</p>
      <p>BMW Motorrad officially started its operations as a part of the Indian subsidiary of BMW Group in April 2017. At present, BMW Motorrad’s range of products and services are available at 23 touch-points across 16 cities in the country.</p>
      <p>The company says the entry level models – the G 310 R and the G 310 GS – were conceived from scratch, represent everything BMW Motorrad stands for, and mark its foray into the sub-500cc segment in India. The BMW G 310 R and BMW G 310 GS have been developed in Munich, Germany, by BMW Motorrad and are locally produced by cooperation partner TVS Motor Company in Hosur, near Bengaluru. </p>
