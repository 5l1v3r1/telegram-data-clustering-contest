        <b>The 'Fleabag' creator has been brought on board for 'No Time To Die'</b>
      </p>
      <p>Phoebe Waller-Bridge has spoken about her experience writing for the new <a href="http://nme.com/tag/james-bond">James Bond</a> film, and how she added “little spices” to the script.</p>
      <p>The <i>Fleabag</i> creator was brought on board to the team working on 2020’s <i>No Time To Die</i>.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Speaking to the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-50331077"><i>BBC</i></a>, Waller-Bridge spoke of how she was brought on board “to help out” with the script for Daniel Craig’s last outing as Bond.</p>
      <p>“They were just looking for tweaks across a few of the characters and a few of the storylines,” the writer said.</p>

      <p>‘No Time To Die’ is Daniel Craig’s final outing as James Bond</p>
      <p>She continued, talking about the transition of James Bond into the #MeToo era, and tweaking storylines that have been previously criticised for misogyny.</p>
      <p>“They were already doing that themselves,” she said. “They’re having that conversation with themselves the whole time. It (her involvement) was much more practical. Just, ‘You’re a writer, we need some help with these scenes. And you come up with some dialogue for these characters’.”</p>
      <p>Phoebe then stated her belief that “it doesn’t get cooler” than writing for a James Bond movie.</p>
