      <h1>Brookman: Our most precious resource is experience, and we're wasting it</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T12:00:38+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">George Brookman</a></address>
      <p>“Lonely” is actually a four-letter word. “Lonely” is a curse! In the last few weeks, I have seen the truth in that statement over and over. Here in Alberta, we talk a lot about resources and our challenges in getting our resources to market. We talk a lot about low prices caused by various policies, and we express on a regular basis our frustrations at the missed opportunities we are living with.</p>
      <p>However, there’s an even more precious resource than oil and gas, and that resource is “experience.” The experience of engineers who used a computer as a tool, but never forgot that if it doesn’t feel right, you need to check again. The experience of people who believe a “gut check” is always important.    </p>
      <p>As the downturn has hit us so hard for going on five years, we have seen many individuals either forced into retirement or downsized out of long-term positions.  Someone told me recently that the worst thing you can be today is “an old white guy” and in our quest for diversity, gender equality and balance, “experience” is that something special that is being forgotten. We are shunting aside huge amounts of talent and these individuals are finding themselves without a reason to get up in the morning. They are often lonely, frustrated and depressed because their wisdom is not considered relevant in this rapidly changing world.</p>
      <p>These are people who have gone through many recessions in the past, have saved and turned around failing companies, who have drafted government policy and enacted change.</p>
      <p>Today, many of them sit alone, no one calls and no one listens to their ideas or their solutions. Too many are treated as “old school.”</p>
      <p>Recently, I attended the incredibly successful Top 7 over 70 Gala and I was overwhelmed by the talent and ingenuity shown by the seven winners. To clarify, these are all individuals who have been able to start a business or an organization after they turned 70, and the ideas and the resourcefulness they have shown is truly inspiring.</p>
      <p>There are not just seven or 70 people like this, there are hundreds, individuals who are ready, willing and able to roll up their sleeves and put their considerable talents and abilities to work to advise, guide and even lead companies that are struggling. </p>
      <p>As a baby boomer myself, I understand the frustrations of being told that I am not speaking in politically correct terms; that my ideas might have worked in the ’70s or the ’80s, but won’t work for millennials, Gen Xers or whatever current letter we are applying to the new generation. </p>
      <p>So why am I on this kick at the moment? Well, first of all, in the last little while, I have encountered a number of very bright, clever individuals who spend their days reading, watching football on TV or just wondering what the next day might bring. Yes, of course, they can get up and volunteer; they can apply for a job as a greeter at Walmart or they can go on extended holidays — all perfectly reasonable solutions to their problem. However, what do any of those choices do for our country? It is as great a waste of resources and potential revenues to the country as a delayed pipeline or the low cost, bargain price sale of our energy resources.</p>
      <p>Our province and our country will come through this period. I do not believe that Canada will break up and I cannot get behind the notion of Alberta separating from the rest of the country. What we do need to do, however, is reach out to the wisdom of the ages, engage people who have been there before, not to the exclusion of young men and women, but rather as a resource to support them. Young people bring energy and enthusiasm, the older generation brings patience and experience. It will take everyone to turn this economy around, and I hope that there will be many who will offer to serve and there will be more who will take up their offers. Too many people are hurting right now, and somewhere out there are the answers to getting our province and our country back to greatness.</p>
