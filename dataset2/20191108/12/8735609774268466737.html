      <p>MONTREAL -- Amazon has announced it plans to open its first fulfillment centre in Quebec.</p>
      <p>The warehouse will be located in Montreal’s Lachine borough and the e-commerce giant says it expects the facility to create 300 full-time jobs.</p>
      <p>"We're excited about our growth in Montreal, which gives us the opportunity to better serve our customers across Quebec," said Alexandre Gagnon, vice-president of Amazon Canada.</p>
      <p>The facility will be located in Lachine's industrial park north of Highway 20.</p>
      <p>"A giant just landed in Lachine, in Montreal, in Quebec," said Lachine Mayor Maja Vodanovic, citing the borough's central location as ideal for the tech giant. "We're between the port and the airport and next to the trains, so there's no better place for the logistics of transport."</p>
      <p>Those working at the facility will pick, pack and ship items to customers. Amazon Canada says the pieces will include toys, pet products and small electronics.</p>
      <p>Amazon has received criticism for some of its labour practices, but in a statement to CTV News, said it's "proud to be a leader in offering a safe workplace." </p>
      <p>Beyond a boost to the economy, but Vodanovic, who serves on Canad'as Zero Waste Council, said this will allow for close ties with the tech giant. </p>
      <p>"Some people don't like certain things about Amazon. They think they're getting certain advantages. Well now that they're here we can negotiate with Amazon, we can talk to them directly," she said, pointing to negotiations over issues like recycling and reducing packaging materials.</p>
      <p>The centre, Amazon's 12th in Canada, is expected to be open by the end of 2020.</p>
      <p>The company announced late last year that it would have a fulfilment centre in Leduc County, Alta., open by 2020 to create more than 600 jobs.</p>
      <p>Amazon also has fulfilment centres in British Columbia and Ontario.</p>
      <p>The build-out of fulfilment centres, which provide both warehouse and shipping services, comes as the company pushes to make faster online order deliveries.</p>
      <p>The company currently offers some same-day delivery in Toronto, Vancouver and Calgary.</p>
