      <p>Galaxy A70s first update brings Link to Windows and Type-C headset support<br/>5 (100%) 1 vote</p>
      <p>The recently released Galaxy A70s is <a href="https://www.tizenhelp.com/first-galaxy-a70s-update-brings-link-to-windows/">receiving its first software update today in India</a>. The firmware in question brings the usual set of bug fixes and performance enhancements, however, there are some new cool additions. One of these additions is the Link to Windows here users can connect their phone to the PC. It allows you to use any apps, get notifications, texts, and photos from your phone on the PC. Besides that, the company also introduced a phone mirroring feature in the firmware.</p>
      <p>Users will be able to enjoy this new mode via a shortcut in the Quick Settings or via the Settings app. Worth noting that this feature came with the Galaxy Note 10 and now <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/Samsung">Samsung</a> is expanding it among several Galaxy smartphones. Another important addition is the Type-C headset support. When Samsung released the original Galaxy A70 it came with a USB Type-C port that could be used only for data transfer and charging. The South-Korean company provided an update several months later with Type-C headphones support. Now, the Galaxy A70s is receiving the same treatment.</p>
      <p>Itâ€™s important to point out that both smartphones come with a 3.5mm headphone jack. But if you want to listen to your sound with a digital Type-C headphone now you can. The third feature introduced by this update is the Bixby Side key function. The new firmware bears the <i>A707FDDU1ASK1 </i>serial number and weighs 313MB in size.</p>
