      <p>An earthquake rocked northwestern Iran before dawn on Friday, killing at least five people and injuring more than 300 in crumbling and collapsed buildings.</p>
      <p>The 5.9-magnitude quake struck at 1:17 am (2247 GMT Thursday) about 120 kilometres (75 miles) southeast of the city of Tabriz, in East Azerbaijan province, the Iranian Seismological Centre said.</p>
      <p>Described as “moderate”, the quake was eight kilometres (five miles) deep and was followed by five aftershocks.</p>
      <p>The provincial governor, Mohammad-Reza Pourmohammadi, told Iranian media that rescue operations were underway in 41 villages, but the damage was largely concentrated in two, Varnakesh and Varzaghan.</p>
      <p>According to the emergency services, nearly 340 people were admitted to hospital for treatment, but all but 17 were discharged by Friday noon.</p>
      <p>Some 40 homes were levelled by the quake and over 200 head of cattle killed.</p>
      <p>Around 100 injured residents were pulled out of the rubble of their damaged or flattened homes.</p>
      <p>Around noon, emergency teams distributed survival kits, stoves, blankets and tents in 78 villages.</p>
      <p>In Varnakesh, an emergency shelter was set up.</p>
      <p>State television broadcast images of people who had fled their homes warming themselves around a fire lit on a public highway.</p>
      <p>But the damage appeared to be less widespread than initially feared.</p>
      <p>The United States Geological Survey (USGS) had issued an alert warning that “significant casualties are likely and the disaster is potentially widespread”.</p>
      <p>In many areas people had returned to their homes by daybreak after the initial panic subsided and the aftershocks petered out.</p>
      <p>The gas supply was restored to all but one of the affected villages.</p>
      <p>The quake was felt in the provincial capital Tabriz and as far away as the city of Rasht, near the Black Sea coast 200 kilometres (125 miles) from the epicentre.</p>
      <p>Tabriz, which has a population of more than a million, is a historic city which served as Iran’s capital several times between the 13th and 16th centuries. Its bazaar is a UNESCO world heritage site.</p>
      <p>Iran sits where two major tectonic plates meet and experiences frequent seismic activity.</p>
      <p>The country has suffered a number of major disasters in recent decades, including at the ancient city of Bam, which was decimated by a catastrophic earthquake in 2003 that killed at least 31,000 people.</p>
      <p>In 1990, a 7.4-magnitude quake in northern Iran killed 40,000 people, injured 300,000 and left half a million homeless, reducing dozens of towns and nearly 2,000 villages to rubble.</p>
      <p>Iran has experienced at least two other significant quakes in recent years — one in 2005 that killed more than 600 people and another in 2012 that left some 300 dead.</p>
