      <p>Aston Villa midfielder Marvelous Nakamba reportedly turned down the captaincy of Zimbabwe.</p>
      <p>According to reports in Zimbabwean media, Warriors general manager Wellington Mpandare offered the 25-year-old the captain's armband but he didn't want it.</p>
      <p>The summer signing from Club Brugge has been in fine form for <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> , playing in every Premier League game since his debut in September's goalless draw with West Ham United at Villa Park.</p>
      <p>Nakamba was exceptional again <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/aston-villa-liverpool-live-robertson-17188264">in Saturday's 2-1 defeat to Liverpool and he has made</a> that defensive midfield position his own.</p>

      <p>As a result, he's become a focal point for his national side - but he isn't the captain with a surprising revelation reportedly made by his country's boss on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>Nakamba's last appearance for his country was an Africa Cup of Nations defeat to Egypt in June.</p>
      <p>"He is not comfortable wearing that thing at all. He was offered at one time and said no," Mpandare is quoted as saying by <a href="https://news.pindula.co.zw/2019/11/08/marvelous-nakamba-turned-down-warriors-captaincy/">Pindula News</a> , relaying quotes from broadcaster ZTN.</p>
