      <h1>3 hairstyle trends from Hollywood celebs to inspire your next look</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T12:01:06+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 12:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/8460/sarah-price/" target="_blank">Sarah Price</a></address>
      <p><b>KARACHI: </b>Hollywood celebrities have taken over Instagram with trending hair and makeup looks to inspire us for our next event.</p>
      <p>Taking cue from the late 90s and early 2000s, we can’t get over their modern take on these key styles. Think old-Hollywood side-parts, messy high buns and, of course, the full bangs.</p>
      <p>If you’re looking to try something a bit different with your tresses, look to Victoria’s Secret model Adriana Lima or <i>Game of Thrones</i> star Sophie Turner. They are two very different looks, yet easy to manage if you want to experiment with something more than just your average blowdry or centre-part. And of course, <i>Umbrella</i> hit maker Rihanna shows us how the full fringe should be done.</p>
      <p>Let’s take a look at the celebrities catching our eye of late and taking on these key beauty trends.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The side-part</b>

      <p>It is back and we are here for it. The middle-parting craze is finally dimming down and we can see celebrities trying out different glamorous styles for formal events. Check out Lima channeling old world charm and looking drop dead gorgeous with sharp winged liner. Use a flat iron to curl your locks and set with a texturing hairspray for extra volume.</p>

        <b>Messy high bun</b>

      <p>We are sure Jonas Brother’s Joe would be impressed by his actor-wife Sophie when she stunned in this updo for an event. It seems the biggest hairstyles right now are heavily influenced by the 90s and early 2000s because messy buns with face-framing tendrils are back in fashion. Pair the look with a plum lipstick and gold hoops like the star to achieve a fun yet elegant look.</p>

      <p>We remember bangs and they are returning with a bang too!  Superstar singer Rihanna has been sporting the trend again recently and we adore how the very French-esque style makes our eyes pop out in all the right ways. Opt for a soft fringe that just touches the eyes to accentuate all the right features.</p>

      <p>If you’re looking to experiment with the fringe further, try out British actor and activist Jameela Jamil’s signature style with natural waves and neon eyeliner. We are sure you’ll stand out from the crowd!</p>
