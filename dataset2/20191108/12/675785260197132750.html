      <h1>Mothercare launches huge 90% off clearance sale - and here are our top picks</h1>
      <h2>The collapsed retailer is promising huge reductions on baby clothes, prams, car seats and toys - but only while stocks last as it clears out warehouses and shelves across the country</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T12:14:07+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 12:14</time> by <a rel="author">Emma Munbodh, https://www.facebook.com/EmmaMunbodh</a></address>
      <p>It's the end of the road for Mothercare after the company announced plans to close all of its remaining branches on Tuesday, on the back of its collapse.</p>
      <p>The company <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/breaking-mothercare-collapses-administration-putting-20630942">has now gone into administration</a>, 2,800 jobs are about to be axed, and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/mothercare-says-returns-no-longer-20834091">it's no longer accepting certain gifts cards or returns</a>.</p>
      <p>And on Friday, three days after officially folding, the chain launched a big closing down sale in stores and online, in efforts to recoup as much money as possible, as part of the final audit.</p>
      <p>It's promising <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/mothercare-kicks-official-closing-down-20835470">big discounts, with baby clothes, prams, car seats and toys all heavily reduced as part of the 'while stocks last' clearance</a>.</p>
      <p>But are the deals any good - or can we expect another disappointing Toys R Us closing down sale, which saw just 10% slashed off products which were later sold to another major retailer?</p>
      <p>We've trawled through the sale - and here are our top picks.</p>
