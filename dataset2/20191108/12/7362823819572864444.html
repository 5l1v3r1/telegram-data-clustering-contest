      <p>He said the drone violated Iran’s airspace but did not provide any additional information, including whether it was a military or civilian drone.</p>
      <p>Iran’s Arabic-Language al-Alam TV channel said: “Residents of Imam Khomeini port city heard the sound of a missile being fired on Friday morning.”</p>
      <p>A U.S. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military">military</a> official told Fox News on Friday that all American drones are accounted for and none have been shot down.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/defense/pentagon">Pentagon</a> official, when asked if any U.S. drone crashed or malfunctioned in the region on Friday, said: “There is no operation reporting of any (U.S.) drone going down.”</p>
      <p>There was no immediate response from Iran’s foe <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/israel">Israel</a>.</p>

      <p>In June, Iran shot down a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/trump-us-warship-iranian-drone-strait-hormuz">U.S. surveillance drone in the Strait of Hormuz</a>. Tehran said the drone "violated" its territorial airspace, while the U.S. called the missile fire "an unprovoked attack" in international airspace over the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf.</p>
      <p>Regional tensions remain high over Tehran's collapsing nuclear deal with world powers, which the U.S. unilaterally withdrew from over a year ago.</p>
