      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T12:27:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 12:27</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/fiat-chrysler">Fiat Chrysler </a>and Peugeot owner PSA would retain all of their car brands if their planned $50 billion merger goes ahead, the would-be chief executive of the combined group said on Friday.</p>
      <p>Last month the two <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/companies">companies </a>announced plans to join forces to create the world's fourth-largest automaker.</p>
      <p>The following are some of the key elements of the deal:</p>
      <p>** <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/fiat-chrysler">Fiat Chrysler </a>Automobiles (FCA) and PSA aim to reach a binding agreement to create a $50 billion company in the coming weeks.</p>
      <p>** The combined automaker would have annual sales of 8.7 million vehicles, total revenues of nearly 170 billion euros ($190 billion) and recurring operating profit of more than 11 billion euros, based on aggregated 2018 results.</p>
      <p>** The new group would be domiciled in the Netherlands, with listings in Paris, Milan and New York.</p>
      <p>** PSA Chief Executive Carlos Tavares would be the group's CEO. FCA Chairman John Elkann would become chairman.</p>
      <p>** The merged group would have 11 board members, six from Peugeot including Chief Executive Carlos Tavares, and five from FCA including Chairman John Elkann.</p>
      <p>** The merger, once completed, is expected to generate 3.7 billion euros in annual synergies. The two groups say no plants would be closed.</p>
      <p>** Prior to completion of the deal, FCA would pay its shareholders a 5.5 billion euro special dividend. It would also hand investors its shares in robot-making unit Comau, which will be spun-off.</p>
      <p>** Also prior to completion, Peugeot would distribute its 46% stake in auto-parts maker Faurecia to its shareholders.</p>
      <p>** Under the deal, major shareholders Exor , French state bank Bpifrance Participations and the Peugeot family would be subject to a three-year lock-up period. In that time, the Peugeot family would be allowed to increase its shareholding by up to 2.5% only by acquiring shares from Bpifrance Participations and China's Dongfeng Motor Group (DFG).</p>
      <p>** A seven-year standstill period following completion of the merger - when extraordinary operations affecting governance cannot be carried out - would apply to shareholders Exor, Bpifrance Participations, DFG and the Peugeot family.</p>
      <p>** According to sources, FCA is being advised by Goldman Sachs and its independent board members by D'Angelin. PSA is being advised by Mediobanca's Messier Maris &amp; Associes unit and Morgan Stanley, with Perella working for its independent board member. Lazard is advising Exor.</p>
      <p>** Exor, the holding company of the Agnelli family which controls FCA with a 29.2% stake, will become the new automaker's single largest investor, with a 14.5% stake.</p>
