      <h1>This highly rated language learning app in the Google Play Store is on sale today</h1>

      <p>There are plenty of immediate benefits of learning a foreign language. For instance, knowing the native language while traveling makes it easier to get around. Furthermore, the ability to communicate in the same language could help close a business deal.</p>
      <p><a href="https://deals.thenextweb.com/sales/mondly-lifetime-subscription-all-languages?utm_source=thenextweb.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=mondly-lifetime-subscription-all-languages_110819&amp;utm_term=scsf-345312&amp;utm_content=a0x1P000004MpS5&amp;scsonar=1">Mondly</a> takes learning a new language out of the traditional classroom setting. The service takes a combination of neural science principles and technology to help users become fluent faster.</p>
      <p>The unique approach starts with tailoring the learning experience on the user’s native language. Other language learning apps on the market force users to learn a foreign language from English. However, Mondly is able to allow their users to learn 33 different languages from their native language including: Spanish, French, German, Japanese, Chinese, and more.</p>
      <p>It is no wonder why 45 million users use the service, and highly rate Mondly as one of the top language learning apps on both the App Store (4.7 out of 5 stars from over 9,000 reviews) and Google Play Store (4.6 out of 5 stars from over 190,000 reviews).</p>
      <p>The secret to Mondly’s success is from their ability to create a curriculum centered on real life situations. First, their state-of-the-art speech recognition provides users with direct feedback on the correct use cases and pronunciation. Their native voice actors make it possible to create a conversational environment. Second, Mondly lays out useful phrases a native speaker would use on a daily basis. Rather than just memorizing a long list of vocabulary words, it teaches users vocabulary through core words and phrases. The curated themes make it that much easier for users to retain more over time.</p>
      <p>For a limited time, TNW readers can get access to all 33 of Mondly’s languages for just <a href="https://deals.thenextweb.com/sales/mondly-lifetime-subscription-all-languages?utm_source=thenextweb.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=mondly-lifetime-subscription-all-languages_110819&amp;utm_term=scsf-345312&amp;utm_content=a0x1P000004MpS5&amp;scsonar=1">$99.99, which is 95% off the normal price</a>.</p>
