      <p>LOS ANGELES: Faced with a growing number of homeless people, Las Vegas has passed a controversial law that bans sleeping on the street and imposes punishments of a US$1,000 fine and six months in prison.</p>
      <p>The ordinance - the latest in a series of measures by US cities to grapple with rising vagrancy - comes into force Sunday (Nov 10), but its criminal provisions will not be applied until February.</p>

      <p>Sleeping on the streets of the gambling hub will only be illegal in downtown Las Vegas and residential areas - not the famous casino "Strip", which comes under a different jurisdiction.</p>
      <p>It will not apply when homeless shelters are full.</p>
      <p>Opponents of the law focused their anger on Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman before and during the vote late Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Demonstrators outside City Hall chanted "Housing, not handcuffs" and held signs proclaiming "Poverty is not a crime", local media reported.</p>
      <p>Goodman said the law is necessary for a city that is highly dependent on tourism revenues and to protect "the health and safety of the entire community".</p>
      <p>The law is not intended to punish the homeless but to help with their reintegration into society, she said, according to NPR radio.</p>
      <p>It has been backed by Las Vegas's Chamber of Commerce.</p>
      <p>According to the latest census, 5,500 people sleep on the streets of southern Nevada each night. Only 2,000 beds are available through municipal services and charities.</p>
      <p>The measure has drawn criticism from beyond Las Vegas, including from several Democratic presidential candidates.</p>
      <p>The explosion in the number of homeless people in the United States - especially in California and New York, where housing prices have soared in recent years - could become an issue in the 2020 election.</p>
      <p>Las Vegas has tried to tackle the issue before. The city council has banned public food handouts, briefly closed public parks, and even banned sleeping within 150m of feces.</p>
      <p>Former mayor Oscar Goodman, the husband of the current mayor, once even proposed shipping homeless people to an abandoned prison 30 miles outside the city, the USA Today newspaper said.</p>
