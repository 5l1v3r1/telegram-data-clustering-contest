      <h1>Founder of Bitmain Rival Held by Police Over Possible IP Dispute</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T12:41:10+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 12:41</time> by <a rel="author">Wolfie Zhao</a></address>
      <p>Zuoxing Yang, founder and CEO of Shenzhen-based bitcoin miner maker MicroBT, is being held by local police to assist an investigation, CoinDesk has learned.</p>
      <p>The investigation is likely over allegations of intellectual property infringement by the firm related to the technology of its rival Beijing-based crypto mining giant Bitmain, according to one source close to MicroBT with knowledge of the matter. The news was first <a href="https://www.theblockbeats.com/news/4444?from=singlemessage&amp;isappinstalled=0">reported</a> by Chinese crypto news source BlockBeats.</p>
      <p>The source confirmed to CoinDesk that Yang was taken away by local police at the end of October – after the unexpected return to Bitmain of Jihan Wu, co-founder of the firm. Wu <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/leaked-transcript-details-power-struggle-inside-bitcoin-mining-giant-bitmain">seized control</a> of Bitmain last week by ousting the company’s other co-founder and then-chairman Micree Zhan.</p>
      <p>Yang was formerly processor design director at Bitmain, responsible for developing the firm’s flagship AntMiner S7 and S9 models around 2016. However, he left the company and raised over $20 million to found MicroBT – which produces the WhatsMiner range of mining devices – after discussions with Zhan and Wu for stock options fell through.</p>
      <p>Bitmain has already <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/former-bitmain-chip-designer-seeks-to-revoke-mining-giants-patent">sued</a> Yang and his company in 2017 over alleged infringement of a patent that Bitmain was granted for bitcoin miner-related technology. In 2018, Yang’s legal team <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/inside-bitewei-the-20-million-bitcoin-miner-being-hailed-as-a-bitmain-rival">successfully</a> appealed to a court in China to have the patent revoked, after which the case was dismissed.</p>
      <p>The source said that at this point it’s not clear how and why a police investigation has been opened over possible intellectual property infringement.</p>
      <p>MicroBT has recently been posing <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/microbt-expects-400-million-q3-revenue-from-miner-sales-despite-chip-holdup">increased competition</a> to top miner manufacturers such as Bitmain and Canaan, having grown its market share in the bitcoin mining industry.</p>
      <p>The firm had not responded to a CoinDesk request for comment at press time. Bitmain did not wish to comment when asked.</p>
