      <h3>CHIEF Justice Diosdado Peralta yesterday disclosed that the Supreme Court granted the request of Quezon City regional trial court Judge Jocelyn Solis-Reyes for a 30-day extension in deciding the Ampatuan massacre case.</h3>
      <p>In his first Meet the Press event, Peralta stressed the high court acknowledged Reyes’ predicament considering the voluminous records of the case.</p>
      <p>Court records will show that the case was submitted for decision on August 22, 2019. This means that Reyes has 90 days to rule on the charges, and a decision may be expected on or before November 20.</p>
      <p>The Maguindanao massacre (or Ampatuan massacre) claimed the lives of 58 individuals including 32 media workers on November 23, 2009.</p>
      <p>Members of the Ampatuan clan are facing criminal charges for allegedly masterminding the cold-blooded killing.</p>
      <p>The victims that included the wife of Maguindanao Governor Esmael Mangudadatu were in a convoy to Shariff Aguak town to file Mangudadatu’s certificate of candidacy for the May 2010 elections.</p>
      <p>A group of armed men stopped the convoy, shot them dead and used a backhoe to bury them while they were still in the vehicles.</p>
      <p>There were a total of 197 accused in the massacre for multiple murders, including prime suspect Andal Ampatuan Jr.</p>
