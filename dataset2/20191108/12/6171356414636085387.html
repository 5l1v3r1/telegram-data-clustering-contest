      <h1>Some people have received texts from Valentine's Day out of nowhere</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T12:22:52+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 12:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/manuel-vonau/" target="_blank">Manuel Vonau</a></address>
      <p>Yesterday night, many people woke up to strange text messages from friends, family, ex-partners, and even deceased ones originally sent on February 14, 2019 that never reached them before. Among some ensuing upbeat and fun conversations, there were also upsets and heartbreaks. The issue seems to stem from a misconfigured system in use across all major US carriers and some Canadian providers, affecting any mobile OS and even Google Voice.</p>
      <p>Two of our team members woke up to such messages as well. While those were rather mild cases, the conversation quickly got confusing, and I don't want to imagine receiving a message from or about a deceased friend or family member, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/7/20953422/text-messages-delayed-received-overnight-valentines-day-delay">which did happen to some</a>. Others suspected that someone hacked or spoofed their phone numbers and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/dsuam1/why_did_my_phone_send_a_text_without_me_knowing/">sent messages</a> to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/dstwlp/someone_texted_my_wife_using_my_phone_number_the/">other people</a> on their behalf.</p>

      <p>It seems like a third-party company called Syniverse is at fault. A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/dszzuo/mysteriously_early_this_morning_scores_of_people/f6uo4wz/">Redditor</a> working for another business involved in the process says that it found hundreds of texts being transmitted at around 1:14 am PST, all originally sent February 14th, coming from Syniverse's servers. The thing is, SMS shouldn't be stored this long, so the company might face class-action lawsuits going forward.</p>
      <p><a href="https://gizmodo.com/why-are-people-suddenly-getting-mysterious-text-message-1839702950">Gizmodo</a> received the following statement from Syniverse: "During an internal maintenance cycle last night, 168,149 previously undelivered text messages were inadvertently sent to multiple mobile operatorsâ€™ subscribers." It says the issue has been resolved, and it wants to review its internal processes to ensure this won't happen again.</p>
