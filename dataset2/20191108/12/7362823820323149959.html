      <p>British singer Pete Doherty has been <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/events/arrest">arrested</a> in Paris for buying cocaine, authorities said.</p>
      <p>The 40-year old former Libertines and Babyshambles frontman was placed in detention on Thursday night after being stopped by police during a drug transaction, theÂ Paris prosecutor's office said.</p>
      <p>The office wouldn't confirm French media reports that Doherty was carrying 2 grams of cocaine and was arrested in Pigalle, an area known for its late-night bars.</p>
