      <h1>The Script announces Irish tour dates for next summer</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T12:14:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 12:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>The Script have announced they will perform an open-air summer show at Irish Independent Park in Cork next summer as part of their huge European Sunsets and Full Moons tour.</p>
      <p>The Script will also play a number of other dates, including a final show at the 3Arena on March 5. They will be supported by special guest Becky Hill on all dates.</p>
      <p>‘Sunsets &amp; Full Moons’ is described as a sequel to The Script’s much-loved debut album.</p>
      <p>Both albums emerged from emotionally turbulent times: The band's lead O’Donoghue lost his father around the time of the release of their debut. Ten years later, he lost his mother as they worked on this album - with both his parents passing on Valentine’s Day.</p>
      <p>The theme, O’Donoghue says, is simple: “No matter how deep and dark it gets, it’s going to be daylight again.”</p>
      <p>Tickets are €49.90 including booking fee are available now. Under 16s must be accompanied by an adult and under 14s must be seated. Concert is subject to licence.</p>
