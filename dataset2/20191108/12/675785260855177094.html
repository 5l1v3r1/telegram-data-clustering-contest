      <h1>BREAKING BBC confirms general election TV debates - including Corbyn clash with Johnson</h1>
      <h2>Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson will face off in a two-way clash on Friday 6 December</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T12:38:25+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 12:38</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Bloom, https://www.facebook.com/mirrordanbloom</a></address>
      <p>The BBC has confirmed a string of TV debates for the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">general election</a> - including a showdown clash between <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> .</p>
      <p>Chiefs unveiled the schedule today after ITV and Sky News confirmed TV debates in the countdown to the December 12 poll.</p>
      <p>The ITV debate on November 19 - between just Mr Corbyn and Mr Johnson - had enraged Lib Dems whose leader Jo Swinson accused the network of sexism.</p>
      <p>But the BBC has also opted for a two-way debate between the PM and Leader of the Opposition. It will be held on Friday 6 December and come live from Southampton.</p>
      <p>As well as that event, there will be a seven-way podium debate between leaders of the seven biggest parties on Friday 29 November.</p>
