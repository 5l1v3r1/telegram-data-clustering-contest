      <p>Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have shared the UEFA Champions League Golden Boot between them for the past 12 seasons, but an African right-back has scored twice as many as goals as the two superstars combined so far this season, and an 18-year-old teenage sensation leads the ranking.</p>

      <p>Messi won the accolade in 2018/19 with 12 goals, claiming his fifth UCL Golden Boot in the process. Ronaldo, meanwhile, has won it seven times, with both the Argentine and himself sharing it with Neymar at the end of the 2014/15 campaign.</p>
      <p>In 2019/20, however, the two superstars have both scored just once so far, and other players have taken centre stage in the Golden Boot race.</p>

      <p>Red Bull Salzburg wonderkid Erling Haaland leads the ranking with seven goals in just four games. He has netted in all four matches so far, including a hat-trick in his first ever UCL appearance on Matchday 1.</p>
      <p>Bayern Munich's in-form striker Robert Lewandowski is in second place with six strikes, ahead of Tottenham Hotspur's Heung-min Son and Manchester City's Raheem Sterling, who share third spot with five goals each.</p>
