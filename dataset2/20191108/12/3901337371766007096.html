      <p>Friday nights at Harry Gwala Stadium have been good to Maritzburg United, so much so that Judas Moseamedi is all but promising their supporters three points tonight…</p>

      <p>The Team of Choice haven’t lost a home game on a Friday evening in any competition since 2017, and will be looking to make it 17 matches without defeat under the ‘Friday Night Lights’ when they take on Bloemfontein Celtic this evening. </p>
      <p>Marizburg find themselves in a purple patch at present under Eric Tinkler, and are six games without defeat after turning around their Absa Premiership form and marching into the semifinals of the Telkom Knockout. </p>
      <p>Now, in the final game before the latest international break, they have the chance to break into the top four with a victory over Bloemfontein Celtic tonight, and Moseamedi is confident that they can get another victory.  </p>
      <p>Speaking to the club’s official website, the attacker said, “When I arrived at the club in the second half of last season, we played Celtic at home… They were 1-0 up but we came back and won 2-1. So we have the upper hand on this one and are determined to collect the three points again. </p>
      <p>“Every time when it’s a home game and it’s a Friday, the only thing we think about is celebrating the three points after the game, we’re not thinking of anything else besides that. I hope to see the supporters in their numbers - we will entertain the fans and collect the three points as usual.</p>

      </p>
      <p>“We’re ready, we have a lot of quality players here. We have Kwanda suspended, but we still have quality players that can come in for the Celtic game and do the job and help us to collect three points.” </p>
      <p>Tonight’s game at Harry Gwala gets underway at 20h00, the same time that Bidvest Wits host SuperSport United.  </p>
