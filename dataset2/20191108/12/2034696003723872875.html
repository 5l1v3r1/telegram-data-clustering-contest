      <p>Stormzy’s announcement comes just days after <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/stormzy-calls-for-jacob-rees-mogg-to-resign-after-claiming-grenfell-victims-lacked-common-sense-2564668">he called on Jacob Rees-Mogg to resign as an MP</a>, after he seemingly suggested that the victims of the Grenfell Tower blaze lacked “common sense” for not fleeing the building.</p>
      <p>Sharing a clip of Rees Mogg’s comments on Twitter, Stormzy wrote: “Oi @Jacob_Rees_Mogg. You need to resign you’re an actual piece of shit, I beg everyone watch this.MP Jacob Rees Mogg in a nutshell saying Grenfell Victims should of [sic] had the common sense to escape. I can’t believe the cheek, fucking hell these politicians are actual aliens.”</p>
      <p>He added: “My man said ‘if either of us were in fire, whatever the fire brigade said, we’d leave a burning building’ as if to say ‘come on bro, they were just dumb’ as if those who lost their lives weren’t smart enough to escape. Fucking hell this man is the scummiest.”</p>
      <p>After describing the June 2017 blaze as “horrifying and terrifying”, Stormzy further commented: “Imagine they’re being instructed by fire fighters – trusted government authorities – to stay put.</p>
      <p>“This scumbag is saying ‘well boy you lot are dumb to of listened then’ can you imagine ?!!!!Oi get this prick out of here these man are scumbags and they are wicked and evil.”</p>
      <p>He also claimed that the government has “blood on their hands” for the tragedy.</p>
