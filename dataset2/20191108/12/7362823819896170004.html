      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T12:34:01+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 12:34</time> by <a rel="author">New York Post</a></address>
      <p>The woman who climbed into the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-york">Bronx</a> Zoo’s lion den shouted “shalom” and exclaimed her devotion to Allah and Jehovah in a wild arraignment in Bronx criminal court early Friday morning.</p>
      <p>Myah Autry, 32, appeared in the courtroom wearing an NYPD t-shirt after being <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/bronx-zoo-new-york-lion-woman-surrenders">arrested on Thursday for criminal trespass</a> in connection with the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/woman-lion-climbing-bronx-zoo">zoo incident</a>.</p>
      <p>Autry repeatedly interrupted the judge, shouting “All praises go to Jah and Jehovah!” when her case was called.</p>

      <p>The judge, her lawyer, and a friend all urged her to be quiet — but Autry refused, exclaiming a number of times that she is a “black Israelite.”</p>
