      <h1>Ex-All Black Naholo wings in for his London Irish debut</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T12:39:16+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 12:39</time> by <a rel="author">Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>London Irish are set to unveil one of their biggest off-season signings this Sunday when they host <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/leicester">Leicester</a> in the Gallagher Premiership.</p>
      <p>It was last February, just two weeks after <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/london-irish-land-all-black-naholo-in-shock-coup-for-club/"><i>RugbyPass </i>first revealed the spectacular move was on</a>, that former All Black <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/highlanders/players/waisake-naholo/">Waisake Naholo</a> was officially confirmed as a new <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/london-irish">London Irish</a> player.</p>
      <p>Coming hot on the heels of securing the signature of former <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/ireland">Ireland</a> player Sean O’Brien, it was quite a coup for then Championship outfit.</p>
      <p>Now finding their feet back in the Premiership following their promotion, Irish will <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/id-people-telling-me-about-naholo-and-i-was-nah-surely-not-then-it-gets-announced-and-youre-like-wow-it-was-true-blair-cowan/">hope that Naholo can quickly add a touch of class</a> in their second home match of this new campaign.</p>
      <p>Their first Madejski Stadium outing this term was their hammering by Sale, a 41-7 defeat played out in front of a meagre 3,622 attendance.</p>

      <p>Naholo is one of two changes from last weekend’s narrow defeat at Saracens, with <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/london-irish/players/terrence-hepetema/">Terrence Hepetema</a> also included at centre in an XV where Declan Kidney is continuing to experiment with former Ireland out-half <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/perpignan/players/paddy-jackson/">Paddy Jackson</a> playing in the full-back berth.</p>
      <p>Another new-season signing, Australia international <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/waratahs/players/nick-phipps/">Nick Phipps</a>, is named among the replacements and is in line to make his debut.</p>
      <p>“Leicester Tigers are coming off the back of a good home win against <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/gloucester">Gloucester</a> last weekend, so we know the challenges that they present to us,” said Kidney. “We are improving as each match comes, so we will be looking to do the same this weekend.”</p>
