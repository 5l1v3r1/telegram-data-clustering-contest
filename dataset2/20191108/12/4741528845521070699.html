      <p>Twitter boss, Jack Dorsey, visited CcHub early on Friday, about 24 hours after he landed on Nigerian soil.</p>
      <p>During his visit to one of Nigeria’s leading tech hub, which was covered by Nairametrics, Jack only took photographs with owners of the facility and other tech innovators at the venue before he left for another undisclosed venue.</p>
      <p>According to Siera, head, Logistics, Twitter, the visit is a low key event and that he was not meant to make any official statement.</p>
