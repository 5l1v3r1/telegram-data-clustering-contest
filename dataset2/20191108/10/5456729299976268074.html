      <h1>Again, oil slips over uncertainty on U.S.-China trade deal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T10:26:27+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 10:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/business/business-news/361545-again-oil-slips-over-uncertainty-on-u-s-china-trade-deal.html" target="_blank">Agency Report</a></address>
      <p>Crude oil futures fell on Friday amid lingering uncertainty on whether, and when, the U.S. and China will agree on a long-awaited deal to end their bitter trade dispute.</p>
      <p>The gloom was compounded by rising crude inventories in the United States.</p>
      <p>Brent crude, the global benchmark, was down 16 cents, or 0.3 per cent, at 62.13 dollars a barrel by 0259 GMT, after gaining 0.9 per cent in the previous session.</p>
      <p>U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was down 23 cents, or 0.4 per cent, at 56.92 dollars a barrel.</p>
      <p>The contract rose 1.4 per cent on Thursday.</p>
      <h4>Unending war</h4>
      <p>The trade war between the world’s two biggest economies has slowed economic growth around the world and prompted analysts to lower forecasts for oil demand, raising concerns that a supply glut could develop in 2020.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, the Chinese commerce ministry said the two countries have agreed in the past two weeks to cancel trade tariffs in different phases, without giving a timeline.</p>
      <p>But that comment was shrouded in doubt soon after when Reuters reported that the plan faces stiff internal opposition in the U.S. administration.</p>
      <p>“Oil is in pause mode as traders await more details on the trade talks,” said Stephen Innes, Asia Pacific market strategist at AxiTrader.</p>
      <h4>OPEC</h4>
      <p>Also sector watchers focused on remarks by OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo this week.</p>
      <p>He said he was more optimistic about the outlook for 2020 because of potentially positive developments on trade disputes, appearing to downplay any need to cut output more deeply.</p>
      <p>A deal between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies, such as Russia, is limiting supplies until March next year.</p>
      <p>The producers meet on December 5-6 in Vienna to review that policy.</p>
      <p>Mr Barkindo’s comments are “spooking the market, especially in the face of the seemingly never-ending run of U.S. inventory builds,” said AxiTrader’s Innes.</p>
      <p>U.S. crude oil stockpiles rose sharply last week as refineries cut output and exports dropped, while refined products extended a multi-week drawdown, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for WTI rose by 1.7 million barrels, the EIA said.</p>
