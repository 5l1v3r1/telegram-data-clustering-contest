        <i>The author of Lanny and Grief is a Thing With Feathers on the influence of John Berger and his admiration for translators</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>The book I am currently reading</b><br/>By my bed, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/30/afropean-by-johny-pitts-review"><i>Afropean</i> by Johny Pitts</a>. In my bag, <i>In</i><i> the Cut</i> by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/dec/14/fiction.features2">Susanna Moore</a>. In the bathroom, <i>Air Histories</i> by Christopher Meredith and <i>I Remain in Darkness</i> by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/10/abortion-sex-and-family-secrets-annie-ernaux-frances-great-truth-teller">Annie Ernaux</a>.</p>
      <p><b>The book that changed my life</b><br/><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/25/in-parenthesis-no-longer-who-was-the-author-of-the-greatest-poem-of-the-first-world-war"><i>In Parenthesis</i> by David Jones</a>.</p>
      <p><b>The book I wish I’d written</b><br/>I’d like to have written or illustrated a book as perfect as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/nov/08/satoshi-kitamura-angry-arthur-illustrations"><i>Angry Arthur</i> by Hiawyn Oram and Satoshi Kitamura</a>. I also wish I’d made a start on my new book.</p>
      <p><b>The book that had the greatest influence on m</b><b>e</b><br/>A cluster of books I read at around the same time: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jul/04/brigflatts-basil-bunting-poetry-review"><i>Briggflatts</i> by Basil Bunting;</a> <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48636/the-glass-essay"><i>Glass, Irony, and God</i> by Anne Carson</a>; <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/dec/04/riddley-walker-russell-hoban-book-club"><i>Riddley Walker</i> by Russell Hoban</a>; <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/jul/13/featuresreviews.guardianreview13"><i>Dart</i> by Alice Oswald</a>. These were the books that lit my fuse.</p>
      <p><b>The book </b><b>that is most overrated</b><br/>I think the whole idea of rating, under or over, better or best, is a nonsense, an unkindness to art and each other. It’s not a good way to think about literature. We need sharper critical tools. If we spent more time reading and less time rating we’d all feel better.</p>
      <p><b>The book that changed my mind</b><br/>Every book is changing it, I hope, but I’ll say<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/02/john-berger-obituary"> John Berger</a>. I’ll never forget the way his books quenched a thirst I didn’t know I had. His work is a radical force for good in the world.</p>
      <p><b>The last book that made me cry</b><br/>Oddly, given how much I like to weep, books don’t tend to do it for me. Sentimental TV adverts, on the other hand …</p>
      <p><b>The last book that made me laugh</b><br/><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/feb/26/oi-frog-kes-gray-jim-field-trailer"><i>Oi Frog!</i> by Kes Gray and Jim Field</a>.</p>
      <p><b>The book I couldn’t finish</b><br/>Loads! But most recently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/02/ruth-rendell-five-key-works">Barbara Vine’s <i>A Dark Adapted Eye</i></a> because my wife nicked it off me.</p>
      <p><b>The book I’m most ashamed not to have read</b><br/>I am ashamed that I can only read books in English. I hope to rectify that, but in the meantime I worship translators.</p>
      <p><b>The book I give as a gift</b><br/>The books I’ve given away most in recent years are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/emma-brockes-blog/2012/oct/11/wendell-berry-environmental-campaigner">Wendell Berry’s</a> <i>Why I Am Not Going to Buy a Computer</i>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/11/say-something-back-denise-riley-review-poetry-son-jacob-a-part-song-maybe-not-under-answering-sky">Denise Riley’s <i>Say Something Back</i></a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/28/ghost-wall-sarah-moss-review">Sarah Moss’s <i>Ghost Wall</i>,</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/12/agota-kristof-the-notebook-slavoj-zizek">Ágota Kristóf’s <i>The Notebook</i></a>, Shigeru Mizuki’s <i>Nonnonba</i>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/21/top-10-norwegian-novels-dea-brovig-knausgard-hamsun">Tarjei Vesaas’s <i>The Ice Palace</i></a><i> </i>and <i>Bunny vs Monkey</i> by Jamie Smart.</p>
      <p><b>The book I’d most like to be remembered for</b><br/>Ah, we can’t be worrying about that.</p>
      <p><b>My earliest reading memory</b><br/><i>Roger Red</i><i>-hat </i>and <i>Jennifer Yellow</i><i>-hat </i>by Sheila McCullagh, with a giant on the hill throwing rocks. I was reading with the teacher, following her finger under the words. I pronounced island “izland” and as I did, it sounded correctly in my mind so I tried again, in unison with my teacher, we hit it perfectly together: “ISLAND” and it was very exciting.</p>
      <p><b>My comfort read</b><br/><i>Avocado Baby</i>, or <i>Would you Rather</i><i> </i>…, or <i>Simp</i>, or <i>Mr Gumpy’s Outing</i>. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/07/john-burningham-obituary">Anything by John Burningham</a>.</p>
      <p>• <i>Max Porter’s Lanny is shortlisted for the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/waterstones">Waterstones</a> Book of the Year 2019.</i></p>
