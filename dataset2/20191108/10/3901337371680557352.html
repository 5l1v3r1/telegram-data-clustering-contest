      <p>“I am very happy with how the boys carried themselves playing against a side such as Zamalek. This practice match gave us a whole lot of positives and some of the things we need to give special attention to before our first group match against Zambia. I am glad we went through that exercise, it helped us a lot,” said Notoane, as quoted on SAFA’s official website. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Notoane’s team has been boosted with the arrival of three players in captain of the side Tercious Malepe, as well as goalkeeper Mondli Mpoto and forward Keletso Makgalwa to take the total number of players in camp to 15.   </p>
