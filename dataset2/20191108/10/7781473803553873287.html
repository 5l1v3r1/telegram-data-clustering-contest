      <p>Royal Enfield is also one of the manufacturers who made the most of their presence at EICMA 2019. Royal Enfield showcased the Himalayan adventure tourer in three different colours alongside the Bullet Trials that was showcased for the first time for the motorcycle enthusiast in Italy.</p>

      <p>Royal Enfield also unveiled another project motorcycle, but this time, a flat tracker dubbed Twins FT - a custom build in collaboration with Harris Performance and inputs from Flat track racers. The chaps at Harris performance and Royal Enfield have derived an all-new motorcycle using minimum mechanical parts from the Interceptor 650.</p>

      <p>It uses a 650cc parallel-twin engine but has a bigger bore than the standard. The engine is housed in a bespoke twin-down pipe cradle chassis made out of brazed steel tube. The exhaust system is from S&amp;S that gets custom fabrication to enhance performance as well as the looks.</p>
      <p>Cycle parts are the telescopic front forks in the front developed by Harris and RSD rims shod with Dunlop flat track tyres. For braking, the Twins FT has a Brembo calliper and master-cylinder mounted for the rear wheel.</p>
      <p>Other custom motorcycles at the Royal Enfield's EICMA 2019 pavilion were Nought Tea v1.0, Nought Tea v2.0, Two Smoking Barrels (TSB), MJR Roach and Gallinella.</p>

      <p>Commenting on the custom display at EICMA 2019, Adrian John Sellers who leads custom motorcycle projects at Royal Enfield said, "We are thrilled to showcase some of this year's most exciting custom builds by Royal Enfield to the motorcycling enthusiasts at EICMA 2019.
