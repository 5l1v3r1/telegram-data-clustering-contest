      <p>If your <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/apple">Apple</a> device is still running on iOS 11, then its time to upgrade to iOS 12 at least. Technically, we all need the App Store support for our devices to work in full throttle. We need the App Store to either get new apps or upgrade older apps. Now, recent reports show that the Apple Store has discontinued its support for iOS 11 devices.</p>

      <p>Since May this year, the Store applications have focused on improvements and performance enhancements. But itâ€™s worth noting that Apple has quietly removed support for the iOS 11 system, and now its Store app supports iOS 12 systems at the minimum. In addition to the inability to download apps, users who already have the app will also need to upgrade to iOS 12 and above to open the Apple Store.</p>
      <p>Apple Store app allows you to purchase the latest Apple products and accessories in a more personalized way. You get recommendations based on the Apple products you own and you also find out which accessories are compatible with your device. In addition, users can easily upgrade from their current devices to a new iPhone device (with terms and conditions of course). Furthermore, the Store App allows users to track orders anytime, anywhere, sign up for an interactive course in the store and even use Apple Pay to checkout from your iPhone.</p>
