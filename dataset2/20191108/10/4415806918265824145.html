      <p>Honda has become the latest car maker to report weaker earnings as global demand softens.</p>
      <p>The company said its profit in the July-September period fell 6.7% from a year earlier to 196.5 billion yen (€1.6bn) as vehicle and motorcycle sales slipped.</p>
      <p>The Tokyo-based firm said an unfavourable exchange rate also hurt earnings.</p>
      <p>Honda’s quarterly revenue declined 2.9% to 3.7 trillion yen (€30bn) as sales declined in the US, Japan, the rest of Asia and Europe.</p>
      <p>Honda, which makes the Odyssey minivan and Asimo robot, said higher tax expenses also hurt results.</p>
      <p>Honda lowered its full-year net profit forecast for the fiscal year through to March 2020 to 575 billion yen.</p>

      <p>That is down from the 645 billion yen (£4.6 billion) estimate given in August, and below the 610 billion yen (£4.3 billion) earned in the previous fiscal year.</p>
      <p>Honda said its financial services business did well, helping to offset some of the damage from other divisions.</p>
      <p>Honda officials acknowledged that more needs to be done to reduce costs. They said a promised restructuring is under way.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, Honda’s Japanese rival Toyota reported its sales grew in key global regions, helping Japan’s top car maker post an increase in quarterly net profit despite a strong yen, which hurts the earnings of Japanese exporters.</p>
      <p>Nissan, which has seen its brand power tarnished amid a financial misconduct scandal, will report earnings next week.</p>
