      <h1>Symmie's remarkable story of survival was very nearly one you never got the chance to read</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T10:36:46+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 10:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/briana-shepherd/6843240" target="_blank">Briana Shepherd</a></address>
      <p>The story of Symerien Brooking's fight against one of the world's rarest medical conditions, and the struggle her mother Sharyn Morris has shouldered to care for her, is extraordinary.</p>
      <p>It's also a story you almost never got the chance to read.</p>
      <p>Last week <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-10-30/how-symmie-survived-against-a-rare-health-condition/11564470">the ABC revealed how Symmie has fought against a condition that should have claimed her life before the age of one</a>, along with Ms Morris's determination to support the child she took on at 10 days of age even though it would lead to financial ruin and a suicide attempt.</p>
      <p>Ms Morris was initially Symmie's foster carer, but from December 2015 — when Symmie was aged 17 months — this changed to a type of arrangement known as a special guardianship order (SGO).</p>
      <p>SGOs were introduced in WA in 2011 and remove a child from the care of the CEO of the department, placing them under a special guardian until they turn 18.</p>
      <p>Ms Morris said she agreed to an SGO as it would give her the authority to make the often-urgent medical decisions required for Symmie's complex care.</p>
      <p>Under this arrangement, the carer takes on virtually all forms of parental authority over the child.</p>
      <p>Except one — the authority to publish.</p>
      <h3>Approvals granted, set to publish</h3>
      <p>The ABC emailed the department a detailed list of questions about their case on September 26, many of which included references to SGOs.</p>
      <p>Two weeks later the department provided a brief official response, in which both Symmie's and Ms Morris's full names were included (albeit misspelt).</p>
      <p>There was no mention of any restrictions in publishing either their names or any other details.</p>
      <p>The ABC and Ms Morris had also obtained verbal and written approval to publish an image of her and Symmie that the department had taken and used for a disability services promotional postcard.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The same image and details about Symmie and Ms Morris had already been used in a press release to promote workshops being run by the department to the media.</p>
      <p>The story was ready to go pending a final check from the ABC's legal team, but then came a development that threatened to shut the story down.</p>
      <h3>One tiny clause, one big problem</h3>
      <p>Section 237 of the Children and Community Services Act 2004 states a person must not publish information or material that identifies, or is likely to lead to the identification, of a child under a "protection order" unless given authorisation from the CEO of the Department of Communities.</p>
      <p>The penalty is a fine of $12,000 and imprisonment for one year.</p>
      <p>The term "protection order" includes special guardianship orders. If we published, we were facing jail.</p>
      <p>Despite the prior approvals, the ABC had no choice but to go back to the department and request authorisation from the CEO to identify Symmie and Ms Morris.</p>
      <p>The request was denied.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Despite the ABC having the blessing of Symmie's legal guardian and her birth family to publish the story, the department refused to allow the story to be told.</p>
      <p>Ms Morris was devastated.</p>
      <blockquote>"So basically I have full parental responsibility of Symmie, the department has ignored my pleas for help for years and left me unassisted while caring for my daughter, but somehow I can't share publicly what it's done?" she said after hearing the news.</blockquote>
      <h3>Department's postcard allowed publication</h3>
      <p>In the end, the department's use of the pair for its own advertising allowed their story to be shared.</p>
      <p>On the back of the department's promotional postcard featuring Symmie and Ms Morris, it states:</p>
      <blockquote>"Symerien is a 3-year-old Aboriginal girl from Fitzroy Crossing. She lives with her foster mother, Sharyn, and has a high-level of disability-related support needs."</blockquote>
      <p>The same photo and identifying details were emailed to media outlets in a press release in February to attract coverage for a series of community consultation workshops run by the department, and stories and photos based on this release remain accessible online.</p>
      <p>An abridged version of Symmie and Ms Morris's story was published online and broadcast on both radio and TV.</p>
      <p>Within hours, the ABC was inundated with messages from members of the public who wanted to help.</p>

      <p>Ms Morris was overwhelmed.</p>
      <p>"It's just been amazing," she said.</p>
      <blockquote>"I really can't believe that people are out there to help us when we've felt so neglected for so long.</blockquote>
      <p>"It's restored my faith in humanity."</p>
      <h3>Approval granted, in the end</h3>
      <p>While the ABC strived to get a response from the State Government, without approval from the department, answers to questions of Child Protection Minister Simone McGurk could not be published.</p>
      <p>Five days after publication, the CEO of the department finally gave permission to identify Symmie as a child on a protection order. The ABC could reveal the family's story in full.</p>
      <p>The following day, <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-05/urgent-review-into-case-involving-symmie-and-carer-sharyn-morris/11670738">Ms McGurk called an urgent review into the department's management of their case</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>"I have asked the department to review this case and also to give Ms Morris the assistance that she needs, and I've made that very clear," she told the ABC.</blockquote>
      <p>"I understand people feel sympathy in seeing Symmie's particular needs and the incredible job that Ms Morris has done in caring for her. The reality is that she's not alone.</p>
      <p>"If people really understood the amazing job that foster carers and carers do for children in care around the state, I think they would be amazed."</p>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>When asked how it was possible to hear those stories, when the department has the ability to shut down any identification of a child who is currently or has previously been on a protection order, Ms McGurk said it was a balancing act.</p>
      <p>"Because the legislation, rightly, precludes disclosure of children in care and their details, it's often difficult, impossible, to talk about the circumstances for those individual children," she said.</p>
      <p>"And also I don't think it's appropriate for me to talk about people's private lives, unless they have given approval for that."</p>
      <p>Ms McGurk made no mention of amending the legislation, but did point towards a recommendation from the royal commission into child sexual abuse that the State Government was in the process of implementing.</p>
      <p>"We have supported independent oversight of the child protection system and I think that should give the public some comfort that there could be some rigour, if people do feel that there's been an injustice in the way that they've been dealt with by the department," she said.</p>
      <p>"We're expediting that recommendation from the royal commission, and I think there might be an ability through that for the public to have more confidence too in the way that our system's being operated, being run."</p>
      <h3>Hope for others to tell their stories</h3>
      <p>Ms Morris said she was motivated not just to get proper support for Symmie, but to allow others in similar situations to tell their stories.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>"Everybody has the right to have their story told. Good or bad," she said.</p>
      <p>"There may be some people out there that have been dealt with nicely by a guardianship order and I hope there is. I hope not everyone of us has been treated the way I have.</p>
      <p>"I didn't do this story just for Symmie and I, I did it for the rights for everyone with an SGO to have that right to be treated equal and not feel that you're raising someone else's child and being punished for it.</p>
      <p>"So I'm hoping that it gets there."</p>
