        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/red-bull-racing">Red Bull Racing</a> driver <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/max-verstappen">Max Verstappen</a> has praised engine suppliers Honda following a "year of learning" during their first season together in the 2019 Formula 1 campaign.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Red Bull ended their partnership with Renault at the end of the 2018 season and announced they'd be teaming up with Honda for this season and it has been a mixed campaign for the Milton Keynes-based squad.</p>
      <p>Verstappen has won two races; firstly in Austria and then Germany not long after. The Dutchman has been linked with a move away from Red Bull at points this season, but has admitted he is excited for the future with the Japanese engine supplier.</p>

      <p><i>"We have already achieved some good results, but we want to take the next step and try to go for the championship next year," </i>Verstappen said. <i>"It was a year of learning with Honda this year and we made good progress. Everyone on the team is very motivated and wants to win."</i></p>
      <p>Red Bull are still undecided on their driver to partner Verstappen for the 2020 season, with <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/pierre-gasly">Pierre Gasly</a> being demoted to <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/scuderia-toro-rosso">Toro Rosso</a> after half of a season with the senior squad.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/alexander-albon">Alex Albon</a> is the current favourite after being called up to replace Gasly and impressing in the RB15 since the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/grandsprix/belgian-grand-prix">Belgian Grand Prix</a> earlier this season.</p>
