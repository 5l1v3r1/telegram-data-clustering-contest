      <h1>Bolton Wanderers boss Keith Hill on Plymouth Argyle FA Cup clash, Ryan Lowe and Remi Matthews</h1>
      <h2>The former Pilgrims' defender has spoken to Plymouth Live ahead of the first round tie</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T10:41:06+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 10:41</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Errington</a></address>
      <p>The last time that Plymouth Argyle played Bolton Wanderers was as long ago as January 1993.</p>
      <p>Peter Shilton’s Pilgrims lost 3-1 away to Bolton at their former ground, Burnden Park.</p>
      <p>Lining up for Argyle that afternoon was defender Keith Hill, who made 151 appearances for the club between 1992 and 1996.</p>
      <p>Now all that time later Hill is the manager of Bolton and his first FA Cup tie in charge of them is against <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/plymouth-argyle">Ryan Lowe’s Pilgrims</a> tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Hill was appointed as Bolton boss at the end of August shortly after the club was rescued out of administration by Football Ventures.</p>
      <p>Wanderers started their season with a 12-point deduction and while they remain bottom of League One they have won their last three games.</p>
      <p>So there is a mood of optimism around the University of Bolton Stadium as they prepare to take on Argyle.</p>
      <p>Hill spared some time to talk to Plymouth Live about the FA Cup clash, Lowe, life at Bolton and Wanderers’ former Pilgrims’ goalkeeper Remi Matthews.</p>
      <h3>How much are you looking forward to having a FA Cup tie against one of your former clubs, Plymouth Argyle?</h3>
      <p>First and foremost, It’s great that it’s at home. I still can’t understand why the early rounds are not regionalised, from an expense point of view and a travelling distance point of view.</p>
      <p>So I’m really pleased that we are at the University of Bolton Stadium, but against Plymouth it’s a difficult tie.</p>
      <p>They are a good side, a big club, unfortunately relegated last season, but I have got no doubt that they will get promoted again under Ryan Lowe and the team that he is trying to assemble, both on and off the field.</p>
      <p>I know the chairman (Simon Hallett) is doing a great job there. I know in the summer that he bought existing shares and got rid of the debt, which is superb for the infrastructure and the future of the football club.</p>
      <p>So I think there is a bright times ahead for Plymouth, 100 per cent, and it’s going to be a difficult tie for us.</p>
      <h3>Ryan Lowe has talked about playing against your sides in the past, and David Flitcroft (Hill’s No 2 at Bolton) was his manager at Bury. What are your thoughts on Ryan?</h3>
      <p>He deserves his opportunity and you have got to take that opportunity. I was a similar age when I went into management – 37, I think I was.</p>
      <p>It’s important that you get the belief of the players on the training pitch and the way that you want to do things.</p>
      <p>Obviously, as a result of the way you want to do things, matchday results are really important in galvanising that belief amongst a group of players.</p>
      <p>He seems to be a very good man-manager, astute in the business he has done over the summer, and I believe that Plymouth will be successful this season.</p>
      <p>It always takes time when you are putting a team together, not just a team on the field of play but his support staff – the team behind the team.</p>
      <p>It’s important that they integrate well and I think you have got to understand that.</p>
      <p>Listen, he has had a great start to his management career. He seems as though he studies quite well, and I’m sure he has studied us.</p>
      <p>We have crossed paths as managers and players as well, so I’m looking forward to doing the opportunity of doing it again on Saturday.</p>
      <h3>You certainly took on a stiff challenge when you were appointed by Bolton. How have your first few months been? They are a big club who are more than capable of playing at a lot higher level.</h3>
      <p>It’s a massive club. We are trying to create a big club mentality. There has been a bit of a malaise for the last two seasons.</p>
      <p>They have been in and out of certain sanctions that have been imposed by the EFL and they have been under an embargo but it’s clean now.</p>
      <p>“It’s a massive football club and an unbelievable opportunity for myself and David, and a new set of players that we are trying to galvanise, and we are trying to balance off with the players that we inherited.</p>
      <p>And I must say the players we have inherited have been absolutely magnificent.</p>
      <p>There has been no hangover from the administration or last season. We are just looking forward now – we are looking at the future.</p>
      <p>We are trying to build and re-establish this great football club to get as high up the football pyramid as we possibly can.</p>
      <p>This club has got Premier League ambitions and Premier League infrastructure, and we have got a sound business plan.</p>
      <h3>Three wins in a row, it’s a good run of form for you. How hopeful are you of staying in League One this season and escaping relegation despite the points deduction?</h3>
      <p>We are optimistic. We are challenging the players, we are challenging ourselves as staff every day and every game that we play.</p>
      <p>More importantly, what we are doing on the training pitch is to establish that rhythm so we can challenge every League One opponent we are playing against.</p>
      <p>The three games that we have won on the bounce have been a product of the previous work that we have done.</p>
      <p>The scoreboard – the end result – that’s the emotional side of the game, but the work we are doing on the training pitch has been evident in all of the games we have played.</p>
      <p>We are optimistic about giving ourselves a fighting chance. We have still got 31 games left so there is a lot of points to play for.</p>
      <p>At this moment in time there is nobody that should be writing us off, and we certainly aren’t writing ourselves off.</p>
      <h3>The league will be your bread and butter, of course it will. How important is a FA Cup run to you this season?</h3>
      <p>Again, we are treating it as just another game. We feel as though running into the second half of the season that we want as many games as we can.</p>
      <p>I have got no fear of playing Saturday-Tuesday, Saturday-Tuesday so we get some sort of continuity and consistency to our week.</p>
      <p>If we get the players that we have injured back fit, and on the training pitch, we will be able to cope with two games a week.</p>
      <p>A FA Cup run is a product of being successful in the work that you are doing during the week, so bring it on.</p>
      <p>If we can stay in the Leasing.com Trophy or the FA Cup for as long as we can it’s success, and it’s what I want at this football club.</p>
      <p>I want the players to embrace those successes so we do want a cup run, but we are not arrogant in any way, shape or form.</p>
      <p>We have got full respect to what is a big task on Saturday playing against Plymouth.</p>
      <h3>The last time that Argyle played against Bolton was at Burnden Park in January 1993 and you were in the team that day. Bolton won 3-1. Andy Morrison scored an own goal. Do you remember that game?</h3>
      <p>Yes, I do. I remember travelling up on the day. The consequence of that second half of the season was that the next season we were in a play-off situation.</p>
      <p>We had a really good squad of players that were brought together and in the next season we were beaten by Burnley in the play-offs.</p>
      <p>We got used to each other, we built relationships on and off the pitch that season we got beaten by Bolton, but the next season was a really successful one.</p>
      <p>If I have any regrets it’s that season because we were a team that was good enough to get promoted and we missed out narrowly.</p>
      <p>We ended up going up to Hartlepool on the last day of the season and I think we beat them 8-1.</p>
      <p>Then we went into the play-offs and got beaten by a Burnley side that finished 12 points behind us.</p>
      <p>I still believe that was a travesty because that team was more than good enough to have got promoted.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, the next season after the play-offs unravelled in relegation, which sometimes happens, but we missed a real opportunity there not getting promoted.</p>
      <p>Playing Bolton at Burnden Park, it was a difficult task and I think Bolton got promoted that season (as runners-up to Stoke City).</p>
      <p>We played against a good side and it was warranted that we got beat 3-1.</p>
      <p>But the product of those games in the second half of that season held us in good stead for the next season, where I thought we were superb.</p>

      <h3>Apparently, Bolton had won 2-0 at Liverpool in a FA Cup replay the midweek before you played them so you caught them at a bad time.</h3>
      <p>They were a very good side. I think we had beaten them earlier on in the season at Home Park (a 2-1 win) but when we played them in January they were hitting their straps.</p>
      <p>They were beating everybody and they had a successful campaign. I think that was under Bruce Rioch, and they had (Andy) Walker and John McGinley playing up front.</p>
      <h3>One last question. Remi Matthews had an excellent loan spell with Argyle when they nearly got into the League One play-offs in 2017/18. How he is doing for Bolton?</h3>
      <p>Brilliant, superb. He was a little bit damaged when we took over. He had been conceding quite a lot of goals.</p>
      <p>I had to reassure him that none of them goals were really down to him individually. It was just the amount of ammunition that was getting fired at him.</p>
      <p>He’s an excellent goalkeeper. He’s leading by example on the training pitch.</p>
      <p>His performances have been superb. He knows which type of game we want to play and I believe he’s at least a Championship, if not a Premier League, goalkeeper in the making.</p>
      <p>He’s still very young as a goalkeeper but every day is an important one to him to progress.</p>
      <p>He has been absolutely superb. He has made some unbelievable matchwinning saves for us and we are really pleased to have him.</p>
      <p>I knew he was a good goalkeeper having seen him perform so well for Plymouth Argyle in that season.</p>
