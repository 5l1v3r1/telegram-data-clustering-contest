      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T10:43:44+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 10:43</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Knight, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/lewis-knight/</a></address>
      <p>What you can’t see can hurt you.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/elisabeth-moss">Elisabeth Moss</a> , award-winning star of The Handmaid's Tale and Mad Men, stars in an all-new terrifying take on The Invisible Man.</p>
      <p>The new film is a re-visioning of the original science fiction novel by H.G. Wells and reboots Universal Pictures' 1933 film of the same name with Gloria Stuart and Claude Rains. <br/><br/>Trapped in an abusive relationship with a wealthy scientist, Cecilia Kass (Moss) escapes in the dead of night and goes into hiding with her sister (Harriet Dyer), alongside their childhood friend ( <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/aldis-hodge">Aldis Hodge</a> ) and his teenage daughter (Euphoria star Storm Reid). <br/><br/>But when Cecilia’s abusive ex (played by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/the-haunting-of-hill-house">The Haunting of Hill House</a> star Oliver Jackson-Cohen) commits suicide and leaves a huge amount of money to her, Cecilia begins to fear that he isn't really dead at all.</p>

      <p>As increasingly dangerous circumstances begin to occur, Cecilia begins to question her own sanity as she believes an unseen tormentor is making her life a living nightmare.</p>
      <p>Horror maestro <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jason-blum">Jason Blum</a> has delivered The Invisible Man with his Blumhouse Productions and he's got in some killer minds to execute this new take on the character.</p>
      <p>The Invisible Man is written, directed and executive produced by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leigh-whannel">Leigh Whannel</a> l, one of the minds behind of the Saw franchise.</p>
      <p>This trailer was certainly creepy enough on its own. <br/><br/><b>The Invisible Man is released in UK cinemas on February 28, 2020.</b></p>
