      <p>Starting from where he left the last time, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ayushmann-Khurrana">Ayushmann Khurrana</a>'s latest offering '<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Bala">Bala</a>' looks all set to be his seventh straight hit in succession. The film which sees him play a prematurely balding guy has opened to a great start, with positive reviews from every corner hailing the film. The film has also opened to a good occupancy and is expected to pick up by the evening and is most likely to register a double-digit opening day collection.</p>

      <p>Major Bollywood, as well as regional releases, are being leaked online within the first day of release, eating up a major chunk of revenue.

      <p>Directed by Amar Kaushik, 'Bala' is a film set in Kanpur that revolves around a man suffering from premature balding and the lack of confidence and societal pressure which runs with it.
