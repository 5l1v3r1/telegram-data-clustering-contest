      <p>A third <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> fan has been <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/celtic-fan-stabbed-back-lazio-20834677">stabbed in Rome</a> just hours after the Hoops <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-match-reports/lazio-1-celtic-2-olivier-20834529">2-1 win</a> over Lazio.</p>
      <p>The supporter, believed to be a 20-year-old man, was attacked near a McDonald’s on Viale Giulio Cesare, in the Prati area of the city at 2.30am on Friday morning.</p>
      <p>Italian media reports the fan was taken to Santo Spirito <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hospitals">hospital</a> shortly after the incident.</p>

      <p>Last night Celtic fans claimed they were <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/celtic-fans-ambushed-rome-amid-20837836">‘ambushed’</a> by Lazio thugs in Rome as they headed back from the Stadio Olimpico in Rome.</p>
      <p>A host of fans took to Twitter to say they were put in danger after a shuttle bus taking them back from the Olympic Stadium broke down and they were forced to walk.</p>
      <p>Twelve Lazio’s ultras were arrested overnight by police for ‘attempted aggression’ against Celtic fans after the game.</p>
