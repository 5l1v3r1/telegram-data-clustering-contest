      <h1>Robbie Savage's Premier League predictions including Liverpool vs Man City</h1>
      <h2>The BT Sport pundit has looked into his crystal ball ahead of the weekend's Premier League fixtures</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T10:50:17+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 10:50</time> by <a rel="author">Robbie Savage, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/robbie-savage/</a></address>
      <p>It is a big weekend of Premier League football, with huge games at both the top and bottom of the table.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> host <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> on Sunday knowing that they could go a massive nine points clear of their title rivals with victory.</p>
      <p>And BT Sport pundit and Mirror columnist Robbie Savage believes they will do just that, backing the Reds to come out with a 2-1 win at Anfield.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere under-pressure <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> manager Unai Emery faces a tough-looking trip to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> City, who are flying high and have won seven of their last eight games in all competitions.</p>
      <p>And Savage can't see the Gunners ending their recent poor form, predicting a 2-1 win for the Foxes at the King Power Stadium.</p>
