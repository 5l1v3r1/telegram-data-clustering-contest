      <h1>Chinese digital agency pushes on with $400 million U.S. IPO: sources</h1>

      <p>(Reuters) - KKR-backed digital advertising agency Cue Holdings is pursuing a New York listing, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter, becoming the latest in a number of mainland technology firms to brush off U.S.-China trade tensions.</p>
      <p>Cue has appointed Credit Suisse (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/CSGN.S">CSGN.S</a>) and Morgan Stanley (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/MS.N">MS.N</a>) to raise $300-$400 million as part of its initial public offering (IPO) due early next year, the sources said.</p>
      <p>The company aims to have a market capitalization of up to $2 billion, they added.</p>
      <p>The people could not be identified because the information has not yet been made public.</p>
      <p>Cue is a digital agency that works with Chinese tech companies like ByteDance, Baidu (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/BIDU.O">BIDU.O</a>) and Tencent (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/0700.HK">0700.HK</a>) to source advertising on their popular Chinese apps like WeChat, Douyin, Jinri Toutiao, and Kuaishou.</p>
      <p>The Shanghai-based company was formed in March last year when four digital firms consisting of WIN, AnG, Wina Tech and Qixin were merged into a partnership and the business was backed by KKR (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/KKR.N">KKR.N</a>) .</p>
      <p>It carried out a private funding round in August which was led by Anchor Equity Partners, the South Korean firm, and Princeville, according to a company statement at the time.</p>
      <p>Cue and KKR spokeswomen declined to comment on the company’s possible IPO, as did Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley.</p>
      <p>If the company presses ahead with a U.S listing, it will be the latest in a string of Chinese tech and cryptocurrency companies contemplating a New York IPO.</p>
      <p>Investment banking sources have told Reuters the companies have not been dissuaded by the U.S.-China trade war and after Washington blacklisted some mainland tech companies like Megvii and Sensetime.</p>
      <p>BitMain Technologies has lodged its prospectus confidentially with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to raise up to $500 million in a deal which could go ahead early next year.</p>
      <p>Similarly, bitcoin miner Canaan Creative updated its U.S. filings with the SEC this week after it lodged its documents to raise up to $400 million. Canaan has appointed Citigroup (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/C.N">C.N</a>) and Credit Suisse to work on the deal.</p>
      <p>Canaan attempted a Chinese listing three years ago through a reverse merger by buying a Shandong-based electric equipment maker and then again filed for a Hong Kong float last year.</p>
      <p>However, both IPO processes were put on hold after regulators expressed doubt about the company’s business model and future growth prospects.</p>
      <p>36Kr, a Chinese tech startup, has more than halved the size of its current deal and will now raise just $24 million and the pricing of the deal is due to occur on Friday in New York.</p>
