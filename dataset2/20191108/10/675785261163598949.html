      <h1>Jordan Henderson opens up on how close he came to leaving Liverpool</h1>
      <h2>Jordan Henderson was offered to Fulham by Liverpool in 2012 as part of a transfer involving Clint Dempsey</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T10:40:35+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 10:40</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>Jordan Henderson admits a proposed move away from Liverpool was the the turning point in his career.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> skipper Henderson was offered to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fulham-fc">Fulham</a> in 2012 as part of a deal to take Clint Dempsey to Anfield.</p>
      <p>Former boss Brendan Rodgers was willing to let Henderson go but the move failed to materialise.</p>
      <p>Henderson knuckled down and won back his place and was named as the club's captain the following season after Steven Gerrard's exit.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the proposed exit, <a href="https://talksport.com/football/627061/jordan-henderson-exclusive-liverpool-leicester-brendan-rodgers-anfield-exit/">Henderson told talkSPORT</a> : "That was a crucial period in my career, not only my Liverpool career.</p>

      <p>“I thought that moment was big, and it was a tough moment, but one that I feel helped me, looking back now.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know what would have happened if I didn’t have that moment. It was tough at the time but thankfully it worked out okay in the end.</p>
      <p>“To be fair to Brendan, he was brilliant with me after that point; he helped me grow as a player and as a person, and I really matured under him.</p>
      <p>“It was a blessing in disguise really.”</p>

      <p>Liverpool take on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> this weekend and can open up a nine-point lead on their title rivals with victory at Anfield.</p>
      <p>But Mohamed Salah has warned his teammates that a win for the Reds will mean little in the title picture.</p>
      <p>"They were talking about that in December last year when we were six or seven points ahead," Salah told Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>"Even if we win, it is a long way. We are in November, it is too early to talk about the Premier League."</p>
