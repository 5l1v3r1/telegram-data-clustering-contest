      <p>NEW DELHI: Equity indices on Friday finished in red with the benchmark BSE sensex plunging over 300 points after global rating agency Moody's Investors Service lowered India's credit rating outlook from "stable" to "negative", saying it was increasingly likely that economic growth will remain lower than in the past.</p>
      <p>After touching an all time intra-day high of 40,749.33, the 30-share BSE index reversed gains to finish 330.13 points or 0.81 per cent lower at 40,323.61. While, the broader NSE Nifty closed 106.35 points or 0.89 per cent lower at 11,905.70.</p>
      <p>Sun Pharma, Vedanta, ONGC, TCS, Hindustan Unilever, ITC and NTPC were the major losers in the sensex pack with their shares falling as much as 4.23 per cent. 24 out of 30 stocks finished in red.</p>
      <p>Whereas, Yes Bank, IndusInd bank, ICICI Bank, Kotak Bank, Tech Mahindra, HCL Tech were the only gainers -- with their shares up as much as 3.76 per cent.</p>
      <p>On NSE, sub-indices Nifty Pharma, Nifty PSU Bank and Nifty FMCG were the top losers with their stocks falling as much as 2.24 per cent.</p>
      <p>Despite positive cues from global markets and sustained foreign fund inflow, domestic equities turned volatile and retreated from record peaks after Moody's Investors Service lowered the outlook on India's credit ratings, traders said.</p>
      <p>The rating agency said that the change in outlook partly reflected government and policy ineffectiveness in addressing economic weakness, which led to an increase in debt burden from already high levels.</p>
      <p>The Indian rupee also depreciated 33 paise to 71.30 against the US dollar intra-day.</p>
      <p>Brent crude futures, the global oil benchmark, fell 1.24 per cent to $61.53 per barrel.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) purchased shares worth Rs 926.60 crore in the capital market on Thursday, while domestic institutional investors sold equities worth Rs 635.59 crore, data available with stock exchange showed.</p>
