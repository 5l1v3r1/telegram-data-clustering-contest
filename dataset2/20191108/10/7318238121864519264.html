      <p>It was the most obvious symbol of the division of Europe after the Second World War. The iron curtain described by Churchill was in fact a concrete barrier. Three and a half meters high. Protected by watchtowers. The scene of numerous attempts to flee communism.</p>

      <p>For one man the emotion is particularly strong.</p>

      <p>He spoke to Euronews' Good Morning Europe programme. You can see the full interview in the player above.</p>
