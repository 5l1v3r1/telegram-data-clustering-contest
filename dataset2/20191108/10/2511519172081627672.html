      <p>The “vast majority” of British shows will be removed from <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/netflix">Netflix</a> within the next year, a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/britbox-launch-bbc-itv-channel-4-cost-subscription-tv-shows-films-a9191106.html">Britbox</a> spokesperson has revealed. </p>
      <p>Britbox, which launched in the UK today (7 November), is a brand new streaming service from the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/BBC">BBC</a> and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Itv">ITV</a> to rival <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/netflix">Netflix</a>, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/amazon">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/apple-tv">Apple TV+</a>. </p>
      <p>The new platform, which promises to have the largest collection of British TV content ever assembled on a single website, is bringing BBC and ITV shows such as <i>The Office</i> “back home”.</p>
      <p>This means thousands of hours of British content will disappear from Netflix. </p>
      <p>ITV group communications and corporate affairs director Paul Moore told <i>The Independent</i>: “The vast majority of British shows will no longer be on Netflix within the next year.” </p>
      <p>Moore explained that most BBC and ITV shows that have been licensed to Netflix and Amazon are on 12-month rolling contracts. When those contracts run out, the shows will move to Britbox.</p>
      <p><i>The Office</i>, for example, “will be coming back home next spring”. </p>
      <p>Shows that were a co-production between UK networks and Netflix or Amazon, such as <i>Bodyguard</i>, “can’t come back home”, according to Moore, who added that “going forward, we won’t license things to Netflix and Amazon in the first place because we now have a home, a streaming service in the UK”.</p>
      <p>Moore revealed that the BBC and ITV have “already been quietly” taking shows back from Netflix “for the last few months”, which is why shows such as <i>Gavin &amp; Stacey </i>and<i> Love Island</i> have been taken off the global streaming site. </p>
      <p>A Netflix source confirmed to <i>The Independent</i> that shows would only leave the platform when their licensing agreements come to an end, and these vary with time.</p>
      <p>While Britbox is on a mission to reclaim British content, it will not be competing to acquire the rights to US or international shows as its focus is purely on UK-produced series. </p>
