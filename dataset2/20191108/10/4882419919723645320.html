      <h1>Celta Vigo midfielder Rafinha's Camp Nou return will have to wait</h1>
      <h2>The Barça man is on loan at Celta but is not fit to play this weekend</h2>

      <p>Rafinha will not be fit for Celta Vigo's visit to Barcelona this weekend as Oscar Garcia begins his new job against one of his former clubs.</p>
      <p>Garcia was appointed as Fran Escriba's replacement in Vigo earlier this week. His first game is against Barça at Camp Nou on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>However, he will be without midfielder Rafinha, who has been denied a reunion against his former teammates. The Brazilian, who is only on loan at Celtla, will miss the game with a knee problem.</p>
      <p>Rafinha has not played since the 2-1 loss at Real Betis 10 days ago. He sat out the 1-0 defeat at home to Getafe, which proved to be Escriba's last game in charge.</p>
