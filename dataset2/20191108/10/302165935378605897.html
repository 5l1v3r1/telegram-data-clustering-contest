      <p>BERLIN, Nov 8 — Around 35 mine staff were trapped about 700 metres below ground, two of them injured, after an unexplained blast in a potash mine in eastern Germany, the <i>Mitteldeutsche Zeitung</i> news website reported, citing a spokesman with the state mining authority.</p>
      <p>The local broadcaster MDR reported that a rescue operation had begun.</p>
      <p>The staff were located in a safe sector of the mine in Teutschenthal, about 150 km (95 miles) southwest of Berlin, and were being supplied with oxygen.</p>
      <p>The mining authority said one of the injured was in a serious condition, the other only lightly injured, and that there was a possibility that they could be brought to the surface through a shaft that was intact.</p>
      <p>The mine is no longer active but is being used to deposit mining waste from elsewhere, the website said. — Reuters</p>
