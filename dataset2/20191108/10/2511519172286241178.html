      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/PeteDoherty">Pete Doherty</a> has been arrested in Paris after being caught by police buying cocaine, according to French media reports.</p>
      <p>The 40-year-old Libertines frontman was found to be carrying drugs when approached by officers in the early hours of Friday morning (8 November).</p>
      <p>The alleged incident took place in the Pigalle district on the corner of Rue Fontaine and Rue de Douai.</p>
      <p>French publication <i><a href="https://www.lepoint.fr/justice/pete-doherty-en-garde-a-vue-pour-detention-de-drogue-08-11-2019-2346042_2386.php">Le Point</a> </i>reports that police arrested Doherty after watching him make a drug deal in the street. According to a police source, he was carrying two grams of cocaine and was under the influence of drugs and alcohol at the time of his arrest.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Paris prosecutors confirmed that Doherty was "placed in detention" and faces drug-related charges.</p>
      <p>The singer, whose band The Puta Madres released an album this year, is a frequent visitor to Paris, and has previously pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine, heroin, cannabis and ketamine.</p>
      <p>Since moving to Margate, Kent, in 2017, he has been arrested by the police on a number of occasions.</p>
      <p>In January this year he was held for 48 hours and questioned. Charges of drug possession and driving related offences were later dropped. </p>
      <p><i>The Independent </i>has contacted Doherty's representative for comment. The Libertines are scheduled to go on tour from 18 November.</p>
