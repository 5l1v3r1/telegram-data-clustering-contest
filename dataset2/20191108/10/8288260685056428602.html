      <h1>Wolves boss Nuno answers that big Aston Villa question</h1>
      <h2>Wolverhampton Wanderers 1-1 Slovan Bratislava | Wolves moved a step closer to Europa League qualification after a late win over Slovan at Molineux - Raul Jimenez with the goal</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T10:23:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 10:23</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Dicken, https://www.facebook.com/alexdickenjournalist/?fref=ts</a></address>
      <p>Nuno Espirito Santo has told Ruben Neves to practice his penalties after his miss against Slovan Bratislava.</p>
      <p>Neves missed a penalty in the second half of <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/wolves-player-ratings-slovan-bratislava-17221528">Wolves’ 1-0 Europa League win</a> despite regular taker Raul Jimenez, who has notched three spot-kicks already this term, being on the field.</p>
      <p>Neves surprisingly stepped up after Pedro Neto was tripped inside the box but Slovan goalkeeper Dominik Greif saved it.</p>
      <p>Jimenez eventually spared his teammate’s blushes with a stoppage time winner - and he is certain to take if <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> get a penalty against Aston Villa on Sunday.</p>

      <p>“Ruben has to improve, he kicked it very bad,” said Nuno. “Very bad. For today it was Ruben, he kicked it so bad, so bad.</p>
      <p>“You have to give credit to the goalkeeper but it was the perfect spot to stop it - high and slow, bad. He has to practice - a lot!”</p>
      <p>Speaking on BT Sport, Nuno confirmed Jimenez will step up if Wolves are awarded a penalty on Sunday: "Today it was Ruben, next time it will be Raul and I hope he makes it."</p>
