      <p>Thursday’s vote was dominated by calls for fairer distribution of wealth on the prosperous Indian Ocean island of 1.3 million people, which touts itself as a bridge between Africa and Asia and has a flourishing financial sector.</p>
      <p>MSM won 38 of the 62 seats up for grabs while its rivals, the Labour Party and the Mauritian Militant Movement (MMM), garnered 13 and 9 seats respectively, the election commission said.</p>
      <p>Two seats on the island of Rodrigues were won by the Organisation of the People of Rodrigues (OPR) party.</p>
      <p>Jugnauth, 57, became prime minister in 2017 when his father stepped down from the post, and has already introduced a minimum wage to try and improve wealth distribution.</p>
      <p>“I have obtained a clear mandate to continue to work toward progress and development in this country,” he told his supporters after the count in his constituency.</p>
      <p>The three parties campaigned on further strengthening the welfare state and improving equality in one of Africa’s most stable and wealthy nations.</p>
      <p>“I will ask everybody to respect the results without bitterness. Let’s put Mauritius first” said Paul Bérenger, the leader of the MMM, during a speech in his constituency.</p>
      <p>Some 723,660 voters, 76.84 percent of those eligible, turned out for the ballot, officials said.</p>
      <p>The turnout was 2% higher than the last election.</p>
      <p>Mauritius expects its economy, which is dependent on tourism and financial services, to expand by 4.1% next year, up from a forecast 3.8% this year. Analysts expect economic diversification to proceed regardless of who wins the election.</p>
      <p>The challenger parties, arguing that the Jugnauth family’s rule has been marked by nepotism and corruption, had appealed to voters to choose change.</p>
      <p>Foreign direct investment in Mauritius totaled 10.68 billion rupees ($295 million) in the first six months of 2019 against 8.84 billion the same period a year earlier, according to official figures.</p>
