      <h2>Exams results from children living in care are above the national average.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T10:20:30+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 10:20</time> by <a rel="author">John-Paul Clark, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/john-paul-clark/</a></address>
      <p>Children in care are achieving exam results above the national average.</p>
      <p>West Lothian Council’s education policy development and scrutiny panel (PDSP) was given an update on the performance of looked-after children (LACs) in Level 5 and Level 6 exams.</p>
      <p>The panel heard that the performance of LAC children was better than their peers across the country in almost all recorded measures.</p>
      <p>This included an increase in S4 LACs achieving five or more Level 5 qualifications, S6 LACs achieving one or more Level 6 qualifications, S6 LACs achieving three or more Level 6 qualifications and S6 LACs achieving five or more Level 6 qualifications.</p>
      <p>Executive councillor for education David Dodds said: “These figures demonstrate that the attainment of looked-after children in West Lothian schools compares favourably when compared to the national average.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“This reflects the hard work of the pupils, staff and carers and we hope this trend continues moving forward.</p>
      <p>“We will continue to monitor performance in these measures in the hope that we can continue this excellent performance.”</p>
      <p>A child who has been in the care of their local authority for more than 24 hours is known as a looked-after child. Scotland’s definition also includes children under a supervision requirement order.</p>
      <p>This means that many of the looked-after children in Scotland are still living at home but with regular contact from social services.</p>
