      <p>NEW DELHI, Nov 8 — An Indian-origin British journalist critical of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has lost his Indian overseas citizenship, a move campaigners said underlined the government’s hostility to a free press.</p>
      <p>The home ministry said yesterday that Aatish Taseer had “concealed the fact that his late father was of Pakistani origin” and was therefore ineligible for Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI).</p>
      <p>Taseer’s cover article on <i>Time</i> magazine’s international edition titled “India’s Divider in Chief” — next to Modi’s face — was published in May ahead of elections that saw Modi win a second term in a landslide.</p>
      <p>The writer’s father Salman Taseer was born in pre-partition British India and was governor of Pakistan’s Punjab province until his assassination in 2011 for opposing the country’s blasphemy laws.</p>
      <p>Born in Britain, Aatish Taseer wrote on <i>Time</i>’s website late yesterday that he lived in India from the age of two with his Indian mother — his sole legal guardian — and had no contact with his father until he was 21.</p>
      <p>“The government had limited means by which they could legally take away my overseas citizenship. Yet they have now acted on those means,” he wrote.</p>
      <p>“(It) is hard not to feel, given the timing, that I was being punished for what I had written.”</p>
      <p>Under Modi, in power since 2014, India has fallen to 140th out of 180 in the World Press Freedom Index compiled by Reporters Without Borders (RSF).</p>
      <p>At least six Indian journalists were killed in connection with their work in 2018, according to RSF, while noting a rise in attacks ahead of this year’s election.</p>
      <p>The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said that Aatish Taseer’s fate showed that Modi’s governing party is “intolerant of criticism and freedom of the press”.</p>
      <p>“Harassing critical writers and journalists not just in India but globally is a disturbing new low for Modi’s government that’s already put Indian democracy on its heels,” said freedom of expression rights group PEN America.</p>
      <p>“Mr. Taseer was given the opportunity to submit his reply/objections regarding his PIO/OCI cards, but he failed to dispute the notice,” an Indian Home Ministry spokesperson tweeted.</p>
      <p>“He has clearly not complied with very basic requirements and hidden information.”</p>
      <p>Millions of people of Indian origin have OCI status, allowing them to travel freely into the country without a visa and stay indefinitely. — AFP</p>
