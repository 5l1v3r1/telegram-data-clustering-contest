      <p>BERLIN, Nov 8 — Russia slays political opponents and China’s tactics would be “horrifyingly familiar” to former East Germans, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said today, describing free nations as being in a “competition of values” with unfree nations.</p>
      <p>In a speech in Berlin on the lessons of the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, Pompeo said “the West – all of us – lost our way in the afterglow of that proud moment.”</p>
      <p>“We thought could divert our resources away from alliances, and our militaries. We were wrong,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Today, Russia – led by a former KGB officer once stationed in Dresden ‒ invades its neighbours and slays political opponents,” he said. “In China, the Chinese Communist Party is shaping a new vision of authoritarianism.”</p>
      <p>“Let’s stand together in unity,” he concluded. “Let’s stand together as allies.” — Reuters</p>
