      <p>State-owned Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) has not received any official communication from the government on a proposal to privatise it, a top official said.</p>
      <p>There is a possibility of government selling its 53.29 per cent stake along with management control in oil marketing and refining firm for about USD 10 billion (around Rs 70,900 crore)<br/><br/>"As far as the privatisation issue is concerned, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/bpcl">BPCL </a>has not been told anything officially so far. I have not got any idea of any other information about any concrete proposal from the government side," <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/bpcl">BPCL </a>director (finance) N Vijayagopal told reporters on Friday.</p>
      <p>He said the Cabinet is yet to take a decision for <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/disinvestment">disinvestment </a>of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/bpcl">BPCL.</a></p>
      <p>"The decision can be taken at the level of the Cabinet committee and that has not happened so far," Vijayagopal said.</p>
      <p>It is being speculated that the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/union-cabinet">Union Cabinet </a>may take up a proposal to privatise BPCL as early as next week.</p>
      <p>Stake sale in BPCL is critical for the government to meet its <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/disinvestment">disinvestment </a>target of Rs 1.05 lakh crore set for the current fiscal year.</p>
