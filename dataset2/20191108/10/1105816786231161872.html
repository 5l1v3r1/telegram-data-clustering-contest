      <h1>Hundreds arrested ahead of verdict on India's Babri mosque</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T10:52:25+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 10:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/76/afp/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p><b>NEW DELHI: </b>Indian police have arrested more than 500 people ahead of a Supreme Court ruling on a hotly disputed religious site in the city of Ayodhya, media reports said, with authorities fearing the verdict could trigger unrest.</p>
      <p>According to the <i><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ayodhya-judgment-sc-to-pronounce-verdict-in-ram-janmbhoomi-babri-masjid-land-dispute-case-tomorrow/articleshow/71974673.cms?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=TOIDesktop">Times of India</a>, </i>the decision on the future of the site claimed by both Muslims and Hindus will be announced on Saturday (tomorrow).</p>
      <p>Thousands of paramilitaries have already been sent to the northern city.</p>
      <p>Hindu hardliners want a temple built on the site, currently barricaded off decades after a 16th-century mosque there was demolished during 1992 riots that left 2,000 people dead.</p>
      <p>Hindus believe the mosque was built over the site of the birthplace of their diety Ram.</p>

      <p>Security is being tightened across India in the run-up to the ruling and Uttar Pradesh state police chief O P Singh told the <i>Economic Times</i> that more than 500 arrests had been made.</p>
      <p>“The main message to the police force is to maintain peace at any cost,” the newspaper quoted him as saying.</p>
      <p>Most of the suspects were taken into custody while a further 70 people were detained over their social media posts, he said – warning the internet could be blocked in the region if required.</p>
      <p>Singh added that police had also identified more than 10,000 people he described as “anti-social”.</p>
      <p>A police spokesperson declined to comment to <i>AFP.</i></p>
      <p>In recent years Ayodhya has become a rallying point for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).</p>
      <p>Some senior BJP members are being tried separately over their role in the mosque’s 1992 destruction.</p>

      <p>In 2010, a high court divided the disputed land between Hindu and Muslim groups but both parties appealed to the Supreme Court which has since repeatedly put off a verdict.</p>
      <p>Media reports say Modi has told ministers to refrain from making comments on the case that could fuel tensions.</p>
      <p>For minority Muslims, the dispute and a recent clampdown in Muslim-majority Kashmir have become symbols of the hostility that they say they face from the government.</p>
      <p>Hindus make up about 80 per cent of India’s 1.3 billion population while there are about 200 million Muslims.</p>
