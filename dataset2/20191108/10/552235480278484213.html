      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T10:13:04+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 10:13</time> by <a rel="author">John-Paul Clark, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/john-paul-clark/</a></address>
      <p>A programme designed to encourage sport and physical activity among schoolchildren welcomed a record number of participants in West Lothian last year.</p>
      <p>The children made 228,000 visits to 74 community sports clubs run by Active Schools in West Lothian, a 16 per cent rise from 2017/18.</p>
      <p>Armadale Primary worked alongside the West Lothian Wolves basketball team to introduce a successful basketball programme at the school. In June they won the Lothian and Borders primary school basketball championships.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Mark Wheelhouse, acting principal teacher, said: “We are so proud of each of them and are delighted with the way they conducted themselves on the day. They acted as fantastic ambassadors for Armadale Primary School and West Lothian as a whole.”</p>
      <p>The Scottish Government report that since 1998 the proportion of children at risk of overweight and obesity has fluctuated between 26 per cent and 33 per cent.</p>
      <p>Bridgend Primary in Linlithgow launched a school improvement plan to educate the school community about the importance of diet, fitness, mental health.</p>
      <p>It said the exercise was successful with positive attitudes towards active living increasing from 56 per cent to 96 per cent. The percentage of pupils taking part in extracurricular activity increased from 59 per cent in 2017-18 to 93 per cent in 2018-19.</p>
      <p>Creating a network of volunteers to deliver their programme is essential to Active Sports and one of the ways they achieve this is by delivering leadership programmes for students such as young ambassadors, Coach Academy West Lothian and Sports Leaders UK.</p>
      <p>Samantha Wilde (16) was selected to become a young ambassador at St Kentigern’s Academy.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Her role was to inspire and encourage pupils to have a healthy and active lifestyle and she relished the job and presented assemblies to promote extracurricular clubs at the school, becoming a vital link between the students, teachers and Active Schools coordinator.</p>
      <p>Samantha’s dedication and commitment was recognised by her PE teachers and she won the Honour Our Sport award for contribution to school sport. She also gained a place on the Coach Academy West Lothian programme.</p>
      <p>Active Schools sport coordinator Matt Costello thanked the volunteers who help with sport sessions.</p>
      <p>He said: “The volunteers played a crucial part in improving the health and wellbeing and attainment of the pupils in West Lothian.”</p>
