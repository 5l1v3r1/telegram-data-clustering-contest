      <p>Former BBC and Channel 4 journalist, presenter and writer Farah Tazeen Ahmad has died, aged 48.</p>
      <p>Ahmad, who passed away on Wednesday after battling cancer, was a well-known figure in British <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/categories/media.html">media</a>, where she was among the first Muslim Asian women to rise to the top of broadcast journalism.</p>
      <p>With a career spanning 20 years across several major outlets, the award-winning British journalist was a foreign correspondent for NBC News and an investigative reporter for Channel 4's current affairs show Dispatches.</p>
      <p>In addition to writing for newspapers, she also wrote a book - The Checkout Girl - about her "undercover" investigation on life on the supermarket conveyor belt.</p>
      <p>Ahmad, of <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/Pakistan.html">Pakistani</a> descent, was a mother of two and an active advocate of women's rights. She was also involved in charitable causes against domestic abuse.</p>
      <p>Her documentary The Hunt for Britain's Sex Gangs won her the Asian Media Awards for Best Investigation in 2013.</p>

      <p>Ahmad's death was announced in a public statement by her brothers, in which they praised her ability to leave a "lasting impression on everyone she met both through her professional and personal life".</p>
      <p>"We remain immensely proud of all she achieved - as a mother, journalist, writer and for her coaching work. So many people have been in touch remarking on her powerful ability to turn around people's lives for the better.</p>
      <p>"She was so proud of her two young boys who are left to remember their loving, kind, smart, nurturing, beautiful mama.</p>
      <p>"She was in an amazing room filled with sunflowers, cushions, candles and an abundance of love when she passed away, surrounded by her close friends and family," the statement said.</p>
      <p>Nida Hasan, Ahmad's niece, said in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2207230162716389&amp;set=a.104597862979640&amp;type=3&amp;theater">Facebook</a>Â post that her aunt was "a doting mother to two of the most intelligent, kind, young boys I know, and a pair of cats".</p>
      <p>Other tributes were paid online, with filmmaker Deeyah Khan saying Ahmad was "widely admired and celebrated for her courage, insight and ground-breaking accomplishments".</p>
      <p>"Tazeen paved the way in an industry that is not always accepting or supportive of women, especially women of colour," Khan added.</p>
      <p>BBC's Rajini Vaidyanathan said she was "deeply saddened Tazeen Ahmad has died".</p>
      <p>"In 2001 when I joined the launch of @bbcthree news, she was the Presenter. Graceful, kind and inspirational she became a mentor and friend. It meant so much to see a brilliant Asian woman excel. She was a dogged journalist + a role model," Vaidyanathan said on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Helen Purvis, a broadcast agent, said on Twitter: "Tazeen Ahmad will be terribly missed. She was an excellent journalist for @C4Dispatches @NBCNews @BBC who searched out truths in some very dark places, winning praise and prizes. A wonderful warm person with a wicked sense of humour that I, for one, will never forget."</p>
