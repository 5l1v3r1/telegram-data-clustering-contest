      <h1>99-year-old WWII vet has the sweetest response to Meghan’s makeup mishap</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T10:52:50+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 10:52</time> by <a rel="author">Bashiera Parker (@bparks_)</a></address>
      <p>Cape Town – Every November the royal family honours the men and women who served their country in the military – and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex each planted a Cross of Remembrance, paying their respects, at the 91st Field of Remembrance at Westminster Abbey this week.</p>
      <p>Remembering the work servicemen and women do for their country is especially important to Prince Harry, who served as an army officer for ten years, reports <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/archie-prince-harry-meghan-markle-update-crawling-teeth-a9190071.html"><b>Independent</b></a>.</p>
      <p>"It's unbelievably hard. I have so much respect and admiration for anyone who has to deal with that," Harry said when he visited the families of servicemen and women earlier in the week. And having just become a dad himself, he acknowledged how much harder it must be for parents, reports <a href="http://armyandyou.co.uk/a-royal-surprise/"><b>Army &amp; You</b></a>. "I can't imagine what it's like to miss so much as they change so quickly," he said.</p>

      <p>After planting a Cross of Remembrance, Harry and Meghan spent time meeting with veterans and family members – and one WWII vet was particularly excited to have met the duchess.</p>
      <p>According to royal correspondent, <a href="https://twitter.com/RE_DailyMail/status/1192455561087991808"><b>Rebecca English</b></a>, Meghan met veteran William Allen, who is 99 years old.</p>
      <p>After thanking him for his service – and giving him a hug and kiss – the duchess pulled away to find her powder had left a smudge on William's jacket, reports <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1090742/meghan-markle-had-the-most-relatable-makeup-mishap-during-field-of-remembrance-visit"><b>E! News</b></a>. But he had the best possible response.</p>
      <p>"I'm never washing that!" the royal fan said, who will also celebrate his 100th birthday next month.</p>
