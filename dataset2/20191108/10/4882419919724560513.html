      <p>Luis Suarez wants to be involved against Celta Vigo on Saturday, which is Barcelona's last game before the November international break.</p>
      <p>The Uruguayan striker was taken off in the first half of last week's loss to Levante with a calf problem and missed the midweek draw with Slavia Prague in the Champions League.</p>
      <p>Barça never revealed how long he would be out for but coach Ernesto Valverde suggested it wasn't too serious. The fear, though, is that it's a relapse of the injury he suffered on the opening day against Athletic Club at San Mames and forced him to miss two games.</p>
      <p>Valverde and the medical team at the club are aware of Suarez's injury history this season and that will weigh on their mind when they weigh up whether to include him this weekend.</p>
      <p>Suarez is pushing to play against Celta and should train on Friday, when a final decision will be made. Jordi Alba should serve as a warning, mind. The left-back rushed back from a hamstring issue and is now facing another three weeks out.</p>
