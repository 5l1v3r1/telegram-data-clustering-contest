      <p><b>He stated that the pieces were created</b> using digital illustration, which comes to life when viewed through an augmented reality app called ‘Artivive’, and placed over the piece in order to enhance it and create new dimensions of the art as viewers will also download information about the subject’s journey in the tech world.</p>
      <p>Tijani said, <i>“Technology is Africa’s fourth industrial revolution, as it powers and impacts lives of millions. There are a number of personalities from across the continent, who have been integral to promoting the technology-at-scale agenda in Africa.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“Nyota is a recognition of these tech leaders, and we are thrilled to be celebrating their work through this incredible augmented reality exhibition. Those included have come up from the trenches; they have paved the way for others in a sector still in its relative infancy, albeit one that is making a massive impact on how Africa operates.”</i>
