      <p>According to AP, citing an emergency official, a magnitude 5.9 earthquake in northwestern Iran killed at least 5 people and injured 300 others. Earlier media reports have put the death toll at 3 persons, while suggesting that only 20 people were injured.</p>
      <p>The magnitude of the tremors was later downgraded by the EMSC to 5.6, while the initial report suggested that the northwestern region of Iran had been hit by a more powerful quake.</p>
      <p>The epicenter of the quake, initially reported as a magnitude 6.0, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201801071060563515-iran-quake-casualties-reports/">was located</a> some 65 km (40 miles) of Herowabad.</p>
