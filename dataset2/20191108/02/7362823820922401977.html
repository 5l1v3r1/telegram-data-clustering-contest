      <p>The head of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/israel">Israel’s</a> Shin Bet internal security agency said Thursday that his organization has foiled more than <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/terrorism">450 terror attacks</a> in the past year, according to <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/shin-bet-thwarted-over-450-terror-attacks-in-2019-chief-says/">The Times of Israel</a>.</p>
      <p>“In the past year, we have thwarted over 450 significant terror attacks, and we have allowed Israeli citizens to have full and comfortable lives in the day-to-day without knowing what’s going on underground, said Shin Bet chief <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/israel-appoints-new-head-of-shin-bet-security-agency.amp">Nadav Argaman</a> at the UVID International Conference and Exhibition on Unmanned Vehicles in Tel Aviv.</p>
      <p>Argaman attributed the success to specialized technologies used by the service, its cooperation with other Israeli security agencies and the organization’s “synergy with our counterparts around the world."</p>

      <p>“Israeli technology and the [defense] industry are always close to us, close to our hearts. We purchase Israeli technologies before [buying] from anywhere else,” Argaman reportedly said. "We are investing in very advanced technology.”</p>
      <p>While Shin Bet has an extensive network of sources and uses conventional intelligence-gathering methods, the agency has also been known to use advanced algorithms to scan social media and other databases for signs of potential terrorist activity, according to the news outlet.</p>
      <p>"We are an agency with excellent people, the best technology and synergy within the agency and with Israeli security authorities, which allows us to have an edge on very challenging enemies," <a href="https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/IDF-maps-house-of-Dolev-terrorist-for-demolition-arrests-11-Palestinians-607135">Jerusalem Post</a> reported Argaman said on Thursday.</p>
