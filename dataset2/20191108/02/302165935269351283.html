      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 8 — Bursa Malaysia continued its positive undertone at the opening today, buoyed by optimistic global trade sentiment following yesterday’s announcement by Washington and Beijing to roll back tariffs imposed on both countries’ goods.</p>
      <p>At 9.22am, the benchmark FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI (FBM KLCI) was 0.75 of-a-point higher at 1,610.08 against Thursday’s close of 1,609.33.</p>
      <p>However, at the opening bell, the key index opened 2.24 points lower at 1,607.09.</p>
      <p>On the broader market, gainers overtook losers 234 to 145, while 264 counters unchanged, 1,350 untraded and 16 others suspended.</p>
      <p>Turnover amounted to 455.57 million shares worth RM185.12 million.</p>
      <p>Malacca Securities Sdn Bhd in its equity note today said, local stocks could still tip higher over the near term amid the more positive market undertone bolstered by the impending trade agreement between the US and China.</p>
      <p>“This is likely to keep the key index on an extended overbought run as the near term positivity will provide more near term trading opportunities,” it said.</p>
      <p>However, it added that buying interests among key index stocks are still relatively benign with most foreign players remaining on the sidelines.</p>
      <p>“We believe that the bouts of buying could still be tempered by mild profit-taking activities ahead of the weekend, while the lower liners and broader market shares will continue to gain ground, riding on the coat-tails of the ongoing positivity of global indices,” it said.</p>
      <p>Of heavyweights performance, IHH was up four sen to RM5.59, Maybank and Digi gained three sen to RM8.78 and RM4.72 respectively, CIMB and Petronas Chemical both added two sen each to RM5.32 and RM7.62.</p>
