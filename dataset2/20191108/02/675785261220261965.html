      <h1>Paul Scholes outlines qualities Man Utd need in midfield as they eye January transfers</h1>
      <h2>Forget holding and attacking midfielders - Scholes says any United signing must be the complete all-rounder</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T02:03:40+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 02:03</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Paul Scholes has outlined the qualities be believes Manchester United need in midfield as they target new signings in the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>Boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer looks set to strengthen his squad in the new year, with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">United</a> down in 10th place in the Premier League after a stuttering start to the season.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils' <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/manchester-united-3-0-partizan-20836060">3-0 win over Partizan Belgrade</a> on Thursday ensured qualification to the last 32 of the Europa League - and United will no doubt want to take as strong a squad a possible into the knockout stages with the competition offering a route back into the Champions League.</p>
      <p>While United desperately need an out-and-out striker they are also expected to strengthen in midfield, with players like West Ham's Declan Rice, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> City attacker James Maddison, Newcastle's Sean Longstaff and Sporting Lisbon's Bruno Fernandes having been linked with the club.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/paul-scholes">Scholes</a> says what Solskjaer needs is more players like Scott McTominay - who came off injured during the win over Partizan but has been one of United's best players this season, earning plaudits for his all-round game in midfield.</p>

      <p>Scholes compared McTominay to his own former team-mate Darren Fletcher, who like his fellow Scot was renowned for his huge contribution to the side both defensively and in attack.</p>
      <p>A superb midfielder himself in his playing days, United legend Scholes spent his career playing alongside other greats such as Roy Keane, Ryan Giggs, David Beckham, Nicky Butt, Michael Carrick and Fletcher.</p>
      <p>And he believes a United midfielder should not be pigeonholed into being a 'holding' or 'attacking' player - insisting they need to be complete all-rounders.</p>
      <p>"There's a lot made of midfielders nowadays, are they a holding midfielder or an attacking midfielder which does my head in a little bit," Scholes told BT Sport.</p>

      <p>"As a good midfielder you need to be able to do a bit of everything.</p>
      <p>"As a central midfield player, especially at Man United, you have to be capable of doing everything.</p>
      <p>"You have to be able to help your defence, you have to help in attack.</p>
      <p>"It's not just about sitting and being a holding midfield player. It's not just about getting forward. You have to have a bit of everything as players I played with had."</p>
