      <p>Brazilian mid-sized lender Banco Inter SA on Thursday launched a smartphone app offering clients direct access to more than 60 stores selling products from appliances to sneakers to beauty products.</p>
      <p>SAO PAULO: Brazilian mid-sized lender Banco Inter SA on Thursday launched a smartphone app offering clients direct access to more than 60 stores selling products from appliances to sneakers to beauty products.</p>
      <p>The launch marks Banco Inter's latest move beyond its existing free checking accounts to lure more clients and increase profitability by becoming a one-stop shop for everything.</p>

      <p>Among its retail partners are Alibaba's AliExpress, Lojas Americanas SA , Natura Cosmeticos SA , Nike Inc , Carrefour Brasil and HP Inc .</p>
      <p>Chief Executive Joao Vitor Menin said in an interview with Reuters that he expects the so-called super app to help the bank attract new clients, either at a faster pace or at a lower cost.</p>
      <p>Menin said the bank could reach roughly 8 million clients by December 2020, more than double its current 3.3 million consumers.</p>
      <p>The lender, in which SoftBank Group Corp bought a 14.9per cent stake earlier this year, will share a portion of commissions from the third-party vendors on the app with its clients in the form of cash-back rebates. The commissions will also provide the bank a new revenue stream.</p>
      <p>Some analysts still doubt whether such multi-function apps, widely used in China and elsewhere in Asia, will catch on in Latin America's largest economy.</p>
      <p>"A bank's app is one that people use more recurrently," he said. "So we believe clients will buy products and services through Inter's app. It will prove to be easier."</p>
      <p>Banco Inter posted on Wednesday a 38.1per cent drop in third-quarter net income from a year earlier, to 11.8 million reais, as expenses rose at a faster pace than revenues</p>
