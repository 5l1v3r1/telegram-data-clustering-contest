      <p>(HONOLULU) — The U.S. Coast Guard says a cargo ship has spilled oil into Honolulu Harbor.</p>
      <p>Coast Guard Petty Officer 2nd Class James Connor says local and federal officials are working on cleanup Thursday after a 433-foot (132-meter) container ship spilled oil a day earlier during a fueling operation.</p>
      <p>It is not immediately clear how much oil spilled or how much fuel the vessel holds. It’s owned by the U.S. shipping company Matson Inc.</p>
      <p>Absorbent material was placed around the ship and about 120 gallons of oil has been recovered so far.</p>
      <p>A Coast Guard flight confirmed oil has leaked outside a containment area and is washing ashore across the harbor on Sand Island. Officials say there are no reports of wildlife being injured.</p>
