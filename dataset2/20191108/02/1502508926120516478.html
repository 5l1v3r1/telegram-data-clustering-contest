      <p>Corporate results and the latest signs of progress in US-China trade relation will be the top factors guiding investor sentiment today.</p>
      <p>China and the United States have agreed to roll back tariffs on each others’ goods as part of the first phase of a trade deal, officials from both sides said on Thursday, in further signs of progress.</p>
      <p>In the results corner, Tata Power, Mahindra &amp; Mahindra, Bank of Baroda, and Nestle India are among the 180 companies scheduled to announce their September quarter results today.</p>
      <p>Analysts expect Bank of Baroda to report muted loan growth and marginally higher net interest income on a sequential basis. Reliance Securities, for instance, expects the net profit to decline 52.2 per cent QoQ to Rs 339.3 crore.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, India’s credit ratings outlook was cut to negative from stable by Moody’s Investors Service on concern the government won’t be able to help stunted economic growth.</p>

      <p>Analysts say Nifty's close above the 12,000-mark is a positive in the short-term and it can be seen inching towards 12,200 with crucial support at 11,900 levels.</p>
      <p>On the global front, MSCI’s gauge of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged up 0.2 per cent in early trade while Tokyo's Nikkei jumped 0.75 per cent to a 13-month high. On Wall Street, the Dow and S&amp;P 500 notched record closing highs on Thursday after the latest developments in the US-China front. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 182 points, the S&amp;P 500 gained 8.4 points, and the Nasdaq Composite added 24 points.

      <p>In commodities, oil rose above $62 a barrel on Thursday. Brent crude, the global benchmark, rose 55 cents to settle at $62.29 a barrel.</p>
