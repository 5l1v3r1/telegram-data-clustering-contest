      <p>It looks likes Corey Anderson will indeed need to wait for the winner of Jon Jones vs. Dominick Reyes, that is if Jones has his way.</p>

      <p>Jones met up with his coaches and assessed the skill-sets of both Reyes and Anderson. According to the UFC light-heavyweight champion, Reyes was determined to be the “more dangerous” of the two potential title challengers.</p>
      <p>“Just finished a coaches meeting studying Dominick and Cory‘s careers,” Jones tweeted on Thursday. “Established Dominick [is] definitely the more dangerous fighter. Beating his ass next.”</p>

      <p>Reyes (12-0) is a perfect 6-0 in the UFC, most-recently <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/10/19/20921749/mma-news-pros-react-dominick-reyes-ko-chris-weidman-ufc-boston">knocking out former middleweight champion Chris Weidman</a> in the latter’s light-heavyweight debut. Anderson (13-4) has been a UFC product since his third professional bout. Anderson has bounced back from a career-worst skid of 1-3 nicely. He has won four consecutive fights, most recently <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/2/20945775/mma-news-pros-react-corey-anderson-tko-johnny-walker-ufc-244">TKOing hot prospect Johnny Walker</a> in just over two minutes at UFC 244.</p>

      <p>An irate Anderson, 30, emotionally campaigned for a fight with Jones. He is willing to wait for Jones and Reyes to resolve things, but <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/7/20952880/ufc-244-corey-anderson-clarifies-ufc-release-demand-says-hes-in-no-rush-for-title-fight-mma-news">has threatened to ask for his release</a> should he not get a title shot in the foreseeable future.</p>
