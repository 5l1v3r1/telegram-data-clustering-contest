        <b>The teachers and students demonstrating at Jahangirnagar University will submit information to substantiate allegations of corruption they have levelled against Vice-Chancellor Professor Farzana Islam.</b>
      </p>
      <p>They would inform the University Grants Commission and the education ministry about the allegations on Friday, student Rakibul Islam Rony, one of the organisers of the protests, announced at a demonstration outside the VC’s residence on the campus on Thursday evening.</p>
      <p>They staged a concert there after holding marches and rallies throughout the day.</p>
      <p>The announcement came after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said the protesters would face ‘consequences’ if they fail to back up their claims.</p>
      <p>A group of teachers and students continued demonstration for VC Farzana’s resignation after the authorities shut the campus indefinitely following an attack on the protesters on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Rony said they would stage a sit-in outside the administrative building and hold a painting campaign on Friday morning.</p>
