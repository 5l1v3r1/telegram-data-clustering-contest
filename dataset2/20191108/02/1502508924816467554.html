      <p>There was further relief for residents of Delhi as light rains helped improve <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-air-quality-index">Air Quality Index </a>(AQI) to some extent. As of 7:30 am, the overall AQI for the city stood at 314, which is classified under 'Poor'.</p>
      <p>According to SAFAR, the AQI is likely to improve further in the event of adequate rainfall.</p>
      <p>The agency further noted, "The effective biomass fire counts observed on 6th Nov were high (3534) but the wind direction is not favorable for any stubble fire plume intrusion."</p>
      <p>Going by to the IMD's forecast for Delhi, Friday will see more improvement with, "Partly cloudy sky. Possibility of very light rain/thunder showers. Shallow/moderate fog in the morning."</p>
      <p>Delhi's overall AQI improved significantly (from very poor to poor) the day before, on Thursday, more rapidly than predicted. The PM 2.5 -- tiny particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter that can enter into the lungs and event the bloodstream -- and PM 10 levels also dropped.</p>
      <p>An AQI between 0-50 is considered good, 51-100 satisfactory, 101-200 moderate, 201-300 poor, 301-400 very poor, and 401-500 severe. Above 500 is severe-plus emergency category.</p>
