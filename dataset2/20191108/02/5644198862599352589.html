      <p>Promoted Norwich City do not have the financial resources to compete with established Premier League clubs and are always the underdogs, manager Daniel Farke said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>REUTERS: Promoted Norwich City do not have the financial resources to compete with established Premier League clubs and are always the underdogs, manager Daniel Farke said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Despite a famous home win over champions Manchester City in September, Norwich have lost eight of their 11 league games this season and sit second bottom of the 20-team standings.</p>

      <p>"We're the underdog in every game, so we cannot expect to win each match," Farke told reporters ahead of Friday's clash against bottom side Watford. "The results are not nice. It's difficult to face different moods during the season.</p>
      <p>"Right now is a tough place to be in with (the) moods and confidence of players, but we're looking much better... It's difficult for the supporters... as it is for us, but it is so important that we stick together in these games."</p>
      <p>Norwich did not spend big in the close-season transfer window, their highest outlay being a three million pounds (US$3.85 million) loan fee for goalkeeper Ralf Fahrmann from Schalke 04.</p>
      <p>"We're not proud of not being able to spend all these millions like the other Premier League clubs, quite the opposite," German Farke added.</p>
      <p>"But we have to deal with that and take the right measures, like developing our academy and keep going with what we have. Hopefully one day we can become a prominent financial club, but until then we need to work for that."</p>
      <p>Norwich have struggled to score in recent games, with striker Teemu Pukki's goals drying up since he last netted in the 3-2 win against Manchester City. Farke said he hoped the Finland forward's drought would end against winless Watford.</p>
      <p>"It's important Teemu works hard, he is an experienced striker," Farke said. "He knows these times of struggling to score will come, but he knows we all trust him to get those goals flowing again.</p>
      <p>"There probably is more pressure on Watford than us. They're in a worse position than us and it's not easy, they're meant to be an experienced Premier League team."</p>
