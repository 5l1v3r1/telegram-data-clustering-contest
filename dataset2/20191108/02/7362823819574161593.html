      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/friends">Chandler and Monica</a> are still there for each other.</p>
      <p>"<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/tv">Friends</a>" alum <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/courteney-cox-sara-foster-shades-friends-halloween-costume">Courteney Cox</a> shared a rare picture of herself reuniting with former co-star <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/how-matthew-perry-went-from-90s-heartthrob-to-shambling-wreck">Matthew Perry</a> on Thursday. The pair's characters famously fell in love and got married on the hit '90s sitcom.</p>
      <p>"Guess who I had lunch with today....I KNOW!!" the 55-year-old actress captioned the shot.</p>
