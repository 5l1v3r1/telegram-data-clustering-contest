        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya Nov 8- ODM’s Imran Okoth secured triumphant victory to ensure the Opposition party stumps its authority in Nairobi politics.</b>
      </p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>Imran garnered 24,636 votes against his closest challenger Jubilee’s MacDonald Mariga 11,230’s, to give him and his party the bragging rights in the hotly contested seat in which Deputy President William Ruto had vowed to teach ODM leader Raila Odinga a ‘lesson’.</p>
      <p>The former Kibra NG-CDF Manager now succeeds his late brother Ken Okoth who passed on July after succumbing the fight with Cancer.</p>
      <p>It is no surprise that among the newly elected MP’s first tasks is to unite his constituents from the effects of the rivalry that has grown out of a once-promising political alliance between Odinga and Ruto.</p>
      <p>Friday’s overwhelming victory comes at a time when the opposition party was reeling from losing two parliamentary seats in Embakasi South and Ugenya to give rise to speculation that the Orange party’s appeal was waning.</p>
      <p>This hypothesis was further put to the test by the Deputy President William Ruto’s decision to invade the ODM Leader Raila Odinga’s ‘bedroom’ by fielding former Kenya and Inter FC midfielder Mariga.</p>
      <p>But the former Premier made it clear that he is leaving nothing to chance to ensure that his party retains the seat that he held for well over ten years by reinforcing his campaigns for Imran with surprise stopovers in the elective area that has a mix of lower income housing settlement and suburban housing.</p>
      <p>The campaign was reduced to contest between the two honchos that the manifestos for the 24 candidates who had been cleared by the electoral body to vie came as an afterthought.</p>
      <p>It was left to the candidates to go the extra mile by conducting door to door campaigns in order to sensitize their constituent of the plans to uplift their lives.</p>
      <p>Imran best selling point was that he is the best place to complete his iconic infrastructure and learning projects having been his Constituency funds manager which met he ensured the office remained operational.</p>
