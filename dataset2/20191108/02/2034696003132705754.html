      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/OZZY-OSBOURNE">Ozzy Osbourne</a> has shared the first taster of long-awaited new material with the single ‘Under The Graveyard’ – taken from his first album in 10 years, ‘Ordinary Man’. Check it out below.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/black-sabbath">Black Sabbath</a> turned solo icon has not released an album since <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/ozzy-osbourne-46-1288298">2010’s ‘Scream</a>‘. After a long period of ill health, it was <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/ozzy-osbourne-release-new-album-january-says-sharon-osbourne-2562105">confirmed by his wife Sharon that he would be dropping a new record in January</a>.</p>
      <p>Now, a sample of what’s to come has arrived in the form of ‘Under The Graveyard’ – a dose of pure Ozzy, with dark but soulful classic rock culminating in heavy and proggy riffs, with Osbourne defiantly weighing up his own mortality: “<i>Under the graveyard, we’re all rotting bones – everything you are, can’t take it when you go, I ain’t living this lie no more</i>.”</p>
      <p>Recorded in Los Angeles, the album ‘Ordinary Man’ features producer Andrew Watt on guitars, Duff McKagan (Guns N’ Roses) on bass and Chad Smith (Red Hot Chili Peppers) on drums.</p>
      <p>“It all started when [his daughter] Kelly comes in and says ‘do you want to work on a Post Malone song?’” said Ozzy. “My first thing was ‘who the fuck is Post Malone?!’ I went to Andrew’s [Watt] house and he said we will work really quick. After we finished that song, he said ‘would you be interested in starting an album.’ I said ‘that would be fucking great, but now I am thinking I don’t want to be working in a basement studio for six months! And in just a short time, we had the album done.</p>
      <p>“Duff [McKagan] and Chad [Smith] came in and we would go in and jam during the day and I would go work out the songs in the evenings. I previously had said to Sharon I should be doing an album, but in the back of my mind I was going ‘I haven’t got the fucking strength…’ but Andrew pulled it out of me. I really hope people listen to it and enjoy it, because I put my heart and soul into this album.”</p>

      <p>In January, while recovering from pneumonia, Ozzy suffered a fall at home. He underwent neck surgery for his injuries, the aftermath of which he described as <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/ozzy-osbourne-neck-surgery-agony-health-update-2540180">“agony beyond anything I ever experienced before in my life”</a>.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/ozzy-osbourne-recording-new-music-while-recovering-from-surgery-2540865">Ozzy has been recording new music to keep himself occupied during recovery</a>. In August, he revealed that he had nine song ideas so far, joking that they would end up on a solo album titled ‘Recuperation’.</p>
      <p>He also worked with <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/post-malone">Post Malone</a> and <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/travis-scott">Travis Scott</a> on the track ‘<a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/post-malone-reveals-ozzy-osbourne-collaboration-came-2545878">Take What You Want</a>‘ from <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/post-malone-hollywoods-bleeding-review">Malone’s recent album, ‘Hollywood’s Bleeding’ – </a> described<a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/ozzy-osbourne-says-post-malone-collaboration-got-him-off-his-arse-after-ill-health-2548496"> as the “catalyst” for getting Ozzy back in the spirit</a> for making more new music.</p>
      <p>“I’d never even heard of this kid,” Ozzy said of Malone. “He wanted me to sing on his song ‘Take What You Want’, so I did and then one thing led to another. I started recording a new album with Post Malone’s producer Andrew Watt. It’s only nine tracks but it was a catalyst to get me to where I am today.”</p>
      <p>Fans now await news of a tour, after <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/ozzy-osbourne-postpones-2020-uk-and-european-dates-2555689">Ozzy postponed all of his 2020 UK and European dates</a>.</p>
