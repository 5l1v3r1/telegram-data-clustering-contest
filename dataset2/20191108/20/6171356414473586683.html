      <h1>UE Wonderboom drops to an all-time low of $40 ($60 off)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T20:07:52+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 20:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/cody-english/" target="_blank">Cody English</a></address>
      <p>The sheer abundance of Bluetooth speakers on the market can be overwhelming, but a few brands have managed to rise to prominence — Ultimate Ears, better known as UE, being one of them. Over-sized volume controls and an emphasis on cylindrical designs have helped the brand achieve recognizability in a crowded category. Today, both <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077T4SS3T?tag=androidpolice-20">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/ultimate-ears-wonderboom-portable-bluetooth-speaker-subzero-blue/5750405.p?skuId=5750405">Best Buy</a> have the first-generation UE Wonderboom available for as little as $40.</p>
      <p>Our <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2017/04/30/ue-wonderboom-review-th-waterproof-sounds-great-kind-adorable/">review</a> of the original Wonderboom found it to be a quality speaker made even better by the inclusion of IPX7-rated waterproofing and excellent Bluetooth range. While the Wonderboom is a few years old at this point, it remains a stand-out portable speaker with an estimated 10 hours of playback time, impressive sound quality for a speaker of this size, and the rarely-seen ability to float if it happens to fall into the water.</p>

      <p>Initially, the Wonderboom retailed for $100, but you can save as much as $60 off that MSRP by taking advantage of this deal. Best Buy is selling new units in 'Phantom Black' and 'Subzero Blue,' while Amazon is offering a matching discount on its black, refurbished SKU.</p>
