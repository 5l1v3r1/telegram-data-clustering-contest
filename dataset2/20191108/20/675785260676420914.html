      <h1>Tyson Fury teams up with Braun Strowman on WWE Smackdown in Manchester hometown</h1>
      <h2>The Gypsy King appeared on a special evening of wrestling at the Manchester Arena to go face-to-face with rival Strowman, but they ended up joining forces against Team B</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T20:43:33+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 20:43</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tyson-fury">Tyson Fury</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/braun-strowman">Braun Strowman</a> put their recent grievances to one side on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wwe">WWE</a> Smackdown to fend off a challenge from Curtis Axel and Bo Dallas.</p>
      <p>The Gypsy King returned to his Manchester hometown following his exploits for the franchise in America and the Saudi Arabia, to renew his beef with Strowman.</p>
      <p>Fury knocked out the 'Monster Among Men' at the Crown Jewel event in Riyadh, defeating him by count out, but was then attacked by Strowman post-match.</p>
      <p>They met in the centre of the ring at Manchester Arena to settle their differences, after Fury had stated he had unfinished business with a "Big Dosser".</p>
      <p>Strowman squared up to the heavyweight boxer, and said: "You wanted me, here I am."</p>

      <p>But instead of coming to blows, Fury thanked Strowman for their great fight in the middle east, and suggested if they ever fight again it should be on the same side.</p>
      <p>Strowman joked that no-one would be stupid enough, but they were then disturbed by the B Team duo of Axel and Dallas.</p>
      <p>“We’re stupid enough to fight you,” Axel said.</p>

      <p>Fury and Strowman quickly made light work of the pair.</p>
      <p>Strowman knocked them off the ring apron before smashing them with a running attack at ringside, and throwing Dallas into the ring.</p>
      <p>Fury knocked Dallas clean out, before Strowman landed a Powerslam on Axel to bring the curtain down on the end of the show.</p>
      <p>It was a special night in Manchester, as Raw and Smackdown were filmed back-to-back before being aired in a few days time.</p>
      <p>Fury was making what is believed to be his final wrestling appearance with the brand before returning to boxing duty.</p>
      <p>He now looks set to fulfil his proposed rematch with American <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/deontay-wilder">Deontay Wilder</a> in February, after the WBC made him mandatory challenger to the world heavyweight title.</p>
