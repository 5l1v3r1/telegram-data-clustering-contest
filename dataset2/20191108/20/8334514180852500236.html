      <p>Golden State Warriors guard Steph Curry is “unlikely” to return this season, according to a story Friday from Ric Bucher of Bleacher Report.</p>
      <p>Curry underwent surgery on his broken left hand last Friday. At that time, the team announced it would update his status in three months, which could have put Curry back on the court around the All-Star Game.</p>
      <p>“A team source says the fracture was worse than originally thought, and it’s unlikely that he plays again this season,” Bucher wrote.</p>
      <p>This season was already a hard slide for the Warriors, who have appeared in the NBA Finals in five consecutive seasons — winning in 2015, 2017 and 2018 — but are off to a 2-6 start. Among other issues, they lost Kevin Durant to free agency and Klay Thompson is out for the season due to a torn ACL suffered in the Finals.</p>
      <p>Curry, a two-time MVP, suffered the injury against the Phoenix Suns on Oct. 30 after landing hard on his hand on a drive into the lane that ended with a collision with Suns center Aron Baynes.</p>
      <p>Curry, 31, averaged 20.3 points in the first four games of the season and has a career average of 23.5 points per game.</p>
      <p>Golden State plays Friday night at Minnesota.</p>
