      <p>MOSCOW: A Russian goat named Timur whose unusual friendship with a tiger won him nationwide fame, has died, the director of the safari park where the pair lived, said Friday.</p>
      <p>"Timur's heart stopped beating on Nov 5," Dmitry Mezentsev, director of a safari park outside the Pacific port of Vladivostok, told AFP.</p>

      <p>The billy goat, believed to be around five years old, was cremated and will be buried "with full honours", his keeper Elvira Golovina said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The goat died of natural causes but his health deteriorated following an altercation with a male Siberian tiger he unexpectedly befriended in 2015, Mezentsev said.</p>
      <p>In a story that captivated Russia, Timur was sent to the safari park as live prey for Amur the Siberian tiger.</p>
      <p>But the tiger did not touch the billy goat when it entered the enclosure in late 2015 because the goat did not show any fear.</p>
      <p>The two quickly became inseparable.</p>
      <p>Mezentsev, who studies tigers and leopards, at the time described the unlikely friendship as nothing short of a miracle and a "sign from above" for people to be kinder to each other.</p>
      <p>Timur and Amur slept in the same enclosure, ate and played together. The tiger attempted to teach the goat how to catch prey. They also playfully head-butted and chased each other.</p>
      <p>But the friendship soured as the goat grew more audacious and started challenging the big cat.</p>
      <p>"Timur hassled the tiger for about a month," Mezentsev said.</p>
      <p>In January 2016 the tiger lost patience after the goat stepped on him. He grabbed Timur and threw him off a hillock.</p>
      <p>The frenemies were separated but Timur's health took a turn for the worse.</p>
      <p>He started limping and lost some of his zest for life, while remaining "cheeky", Mezentsev said.</p>
      <p>The park sent the goat to Moscow for treatment but he never fully recovered from the attack by the tiger, who is still alive and living at the safari park.</p>
      <p>The owners now plan to erect a bronze monument on Timur's grave.</p>
      <p>Many Russians said online they were saddened by his passing.</p>
      <p>"Fearless Timur, you will forever remain in our hearts," said one mourner.</p>
