      <p>Parrish Brown, 24, ordered a sweet tea with light ice and extra lemon Oct. 27. It also happened to have three bags of marijuana in it, <a href="https://www.islandpacket.com/news/local/crime/article237063389.html">the Island Packet reported</a>. </p>
      <p>Brown, who paid regular price for his beverage and the rest of his order, believes he unwittingly must have used code language to get the cannabis in his cup.</p>
      <p>“I have never had weed a day in my life, so immediately after I started drinking it, I started to feel weird and it didn’t taste like something I recognized,” <a href="https://www.islandpacket.com/news/local/crime/article237063389.html">Brown told the Island Packet</a>.</p>
      <p>He only realized the marijuana was in the tea once he was “high as a kite.” He opened the lid and saw that he punctured the bags with his straw, mixing the contents.</p>
      <p>“I kept being like, ‘I swear, there is weed in my sweet tea!’” Brown told the Island Packet, recounting his call to police. “The officer asked me why I drank it, and I was like, ‘Well, I was thirsty!’”</p>
      <p>The Beaufort County Sheriff’s Office is investigating.</p>
      <p>McDonald’s said it is “fully cooperating with law enforcement on the validity of this claim.”</p>
