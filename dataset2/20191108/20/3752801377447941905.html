      </p>
      <p>"We have lost a youthful veteran in an important sector in our country. As a professional who qualified in the mid-1990s, Xolani Gwala carried with him the values of our transition to democracy – the values of listening and being open to views that conflict with or offend your own, and a focus on solution," Ramaphosa said.</p>
      <p>The Presidency announced that Gwala's special provincial funeral would also involve ceremonial elements by the South African Police Service.</p>
      <p>The Radio 702 talk show host was remembered in multiple memorial services this week that were attended by veteran journalists, peers, politicians and listeners of the radio station. </p>
      <p>Among those who spoke of Gwala's humility and calm nature was Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams, Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi, Gwala’s close friend and fellow broadcaster Robert Marawa, and his close confidante advocate Muzi Sikhakhane. </p>
