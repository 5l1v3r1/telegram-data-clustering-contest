      <h1>Peakago is the near perfect mini-PC</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T20:10:00+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 20:10</time> by <a rel="author">Surur</a></address>
      <p>We are fans of <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/tag/mini-pc/">mini-PC</a>s, and today we hear of a model, the Peakago mini-PC, which appears to tick many more boxes than other devices.</p>
      <p>The Peakago mini-PC has a small 7-inch full HD screen, Intel Atom x5-Z8350 Cherry Trail and yoga-style flipping touch screen. So far, so standard. It also has a very wide range of ports.</p>

      <p>What sets the mini-PC apart, however, is the presence of 4G-LTE support and the super-low price of less than $300 for the most basic model.</p>
      <p>The full specs include:</p>
      <blockquote>7 inch, 1920 x 1200 pixel IPS touchscreen display<br/>Intel Atom x5-Z8350 Cherry Trail processor<br/>4,500 mAh battery<br/>0.3MP wecbam<br/>802.11b/g/n WiFi<br/>Bluetooth 4.0<br/>1 x USB Type-C<br/>1 x USB 3.0 Type-A<br/>microSD card reader<br/>micro HDMI port<br/>3.5mm audio jack<br/>7.1? x 4.5? x 0.78?<br/>1.2 pounds</blockquote>
      <p>The configurations available include 4GB RAM/64GB storage for $269, 8GB RAM/128GB storage for $339 and 8GB/128GB + 4G LTE for $399, and the device will become available in Indiegogo from the 13th November.</p>
      <p>The main weaknesses are of course the dated processor but otherwise, the Peakago mini-PC is a very competent PC for a very affordable price.</p>
