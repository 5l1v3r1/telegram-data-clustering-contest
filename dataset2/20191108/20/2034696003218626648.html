      <p>The show, which launched on Amazon Prime this year, follows the story of a group of vigilantes fighting back against superheroes who abuse their abilities. Urban, who plays Billy Butcher in the show, stated the popular series would return mid-2020.</p>
      <p>The series was created by Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg and Eric Kripke. Rogen and Goldberg previously collaborated on films including <i>Superbad</i> and <i>This Is The End</i>, while Kripke was the creator and initial showrunner of <i>Supernatural</i> for its first five seasons.</p>

      <p>Upon its release, the show was hailed as being <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/16/boys-amazon-prime-officially-popular-marvel-series-rightly-10751433/">more popular than Netflix’s Marvel TV series offerings</a>, including <i>Daredevil</i> as <i>Jessica Jones </i>– and Marvel’s cinematic features have come in for criticism recently too.</p>
      <p><i>Independence Day</i> director <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/im-not-a-fan-roland-emmerich-agrees-with-martin-scorsese-about-marvel-movies-2565585">Roland Emmerich yesterday (November 7) waded into the ongoing discussion about Marvel cinema</a>. It comes after <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/martin-scorsese-elaborates-earlier-criticism-marvel-films-2564495">Scorsese clarified his previous comments in a new interview this week</a>.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <i><a href="https://screenrant.com/marvel-movies-martin-scorsese-criticism-roland-emmerich-response/">Screen Rant</a></i>, Emmerich sided with Scorsese’s “purist standpoint” on the debate. “I think he sees it from a very [purist] standpoint,” he began, speaking of Scorsese.</p>
      <p>“If you like Martin Scorsese… I think they shouldn’t give him so much flak. But what he’d probably meant is that there may be too many of them. It’s like taking over our business, and it’s really hard for other movies to be even heard.</p>
      <p>“So, in that respect, I’m not a fan of a comic book hero movies. But I accept them for what they are.”</p>
