      <h1>Coronation Street fans creeped out by Geoff after discovering what is on his laptop</h1>
      <h2>Geoff Metcalfe is continuing to torment Yasmeen Nazir and make her feel increasingly insecure about herself on Corrie</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T20:01:19+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 20:01</time> by <a rel="author">Rose Hill, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rose-hill/</a></address>
      <p>Coronation Street viewers were highly disturbed this evening after spotting what Geoff Metcalfe was looking at on his laptop.</p>
      <p>Intent on playing mind games with Yasmeen, he made sure she saw him looking at a dating site, which he said was for research for his radio show.</p>
      <p>But viewers were a little creeped out by his methods and called for him to have a "good bloody slap".</p>
      <p>One tweeted: "What is Geoff looking at now, god he's so weird! #Corrie."</p>
      <p>While another commented: "Geoff is a crook and its financial abuse , hes putting ideas into her head which shes not happy with and then there was the invasion of privacy by watching Yasmeen on the laptop hes got! #Corrie."</p>

      <p>A third remarked: "I really hope Yasmeen ends up murdering Geoff."</p>
      <p>"Geoff is such a horrible sod!! He needs to take David's place in prison see how tough he is then #Corrie," another wrote.</p>
      <p>He continued to sap at her confidence by suggesting that she had an awful memory and that she never listens to a word he says.</p>
      <p>As if that weren't enough, Geoff outrageously lied to Yasmeen by saying that he was planning to take her on a romantic break to Vegas, but says that he's not going to bother as she clearly doesn't trust him.</p>
      <p>Viewers of the ITV soap have watched Yasmeen become a shell of her former self over the abuse, which has seen him stage a robbery and implement CCTV cameras throughout her house.</p>
      <p>Yasmeen (Shelley King) was left terrified after her house was robbed and became frightened to even step foot outside. Of course, this was Geoff's (Ian Bartholomew) aim, so that she would be forced to rely on him for everything, including her finances.</p>
      <p>Geoff obtained an even tighter grip on Yasmeen's life after buying Zeedan's majority share in Speed Daal with Yasmeen.</p>
      <p>This week, Geoff plays mind games with Yasmeen as he makes sure she sees him looking at a dating site, which he says is for research for his radio show.</p>

      <p>Yasmeen is left devastated and next week tries to implore Geoff to come with her to Vegas.</p>

      <p>However he ignores her and heads out without bothering to reply.</p>
      <p>Later, Geoff returns home to discover Yasmeen has packed their bags and is hopeful they can still catch their flight.</p>
      <p>But Geoff lashes out at her for doing his packing and accuses her of being controlling.</p>
      <p>Eventually, Geoff agrees to go on the holiday and he loads the cases into the taxi as Alya says goodbye to her grandmother.</p>
      <p>Will Geoff be able to get into Yasmeen's head even more on holiday?</p>
