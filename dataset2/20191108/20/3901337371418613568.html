      <p>After missing both matches against Chiefs and Maritzburg United in Telkom Knockout and Absa Premiership respectively, Linda Mntambo could make a return for the Buccaneers this weekend. </p>
      <p>Following his Man of the Match performance against Highlands Park in his last appearance for Bucs, Mntambo picked up an injury that has halted his progress. </p>

      <p>The player is believed to have done well in recovering from the setback, with indications that he could be up for selection for Saturday's matchday squad by Rulani Mokwena and his technical team. </p>
      <p>“It was a minor knock and nothing major. He is now fine and should be available for selection for the Chiefs match,” said a source. </p>
      <p>Tickets for the Soweto Derby is sold out and the supporters have been urged to arrive early at the FNB Stadium.     </p>
