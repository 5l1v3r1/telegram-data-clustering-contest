      <h1>Are you getting Google Stadia at launch? [Poll]</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T20:48:53+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 20:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/nexusben1/" target="_blank">Ben Schoon</a></address>
      <p>Google Stadia is finally launching on November 19, and early buyers will be getting hardware over the course of a couple of weeks. Are you ready to stream games when the service launches?</p>
      <p>Stadia’s launch date was just <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/10/15/google-stadia-launching/">confirmed in October</a> alongside the Pixel 4 launch, but the Founder’s Edition kit has been available for pre-order for a few months now.</p>
      <p>That kit came with a limited-edition controller, Chromecast Ultra, and also three months of Stadia Pro for you and a friend, too. Once that kit sold out around the globe, Google <a href="https://store.google.com/product/stadia">started</a> <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/10/22/google-stadia-shipping/">offering the Premiere Edition</a> that also granted early access to the service, but with the inclusion of a standard white controller instead of the limited blue one. Both kits cost $129.</p>
      <p>Importantly, to get in on Google Stadia at launch, you’ll <i>need</i> one of those kits. That’s the only way to get a Stadia name and code right off the bat. Personally, I jumped in on a Stadia Founder’s Edition kit as soon as it was available in June.</p>
      <p>For many, Google Stadia is something they’ll want to wait to buy for a couple of reasons. For one thing, the service doesn’t work everywhere yet. You’ll be able to play on a Chromecast Ultra, Chrome browser, or Pixel smartphone at launch. However, you won’t be able to use any Android tablets, iOS devices, or even an Android TV box, either.</p>
      <p>Another reason that some people may want to wait on getting into Google Stadia is the library of games. At launch, <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/10/08/google-stadia-launch-games/">we’re only expecting around 30 games</a> to be available unless Google has kept some surprise titles hidden until the last minute. In just a few months, though, there will be quite a few more titles available.</p>
