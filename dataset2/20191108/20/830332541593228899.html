      <p>WASHINGTON (CNN) - Former national security adviser John Bolton has significant insights into matters being probed by the impeachment investigators, his lawyer said in a letter to congressional leaders on Friday.</p>
      <p>But Bolton's attorney said his client will not testify until a court resolves whether a subpoena issued to him must be adhered to.</p>
      <p>The letter from lawyer Charles Cooper said, "Ambassador Bolton, who was the National Security Advisor to the President, and who was personally involved in many of the events, meetings, and conversations about which you have already received testimony, as well as many relevant meetings and conversations that have not yet been discussed in the testimonies thus far."</p>
      <p>Cooper's letter underscores that he thinks his client could add critical testimony that has not so far been addressed, but that Bolton is unwilling to testify until a court rules that the White House's claim of immunity is invalid.</p>
