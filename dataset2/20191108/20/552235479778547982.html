      <h1>Noel Gallagher's 90s drug orgy party pad Supernova Heights revisted</h1>
      <h2>"If only Supernova Heights could speak."</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T20:33:23+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 20:33</time> by <a rel="author">Frances Kindon</a></address>
      <p>It was the unofficial go-to party spot for the A-listers of the late 1990s and hosted parties from dawn 'til dusk and then through the night, every day.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/noel-gallgher">Noel Gallagher</a> and ex-wife Meg Matthews' £8million London home was frequently regularly by the likes of Kate Moss, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jude Law, Sadie Frost, Johnny Depp and Ronnie Wood.</p>
      <p>As well as being a hangout for the stars of the day though, it also saw all sorts of drug binges and orgies in the Britpop era, which was of course not known for moderation, as reported in the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/drug-orgies-feral-parties-list-20744512">Daily Mirror</a>.</p>
      <p>"If only Supernova Heights could speak,"  Matthews said last month of the legendary gaff.</p>
      <p>"I remember Gwyneth Paltrow running in going, 'Look at my engagement ring from Brad Pitt.' I mean, there were all sorts of things going on," Meg told podcast White Wine Question Time in September.</p>

      <p>But A-listers flashing their engagement rings is one of the more tame stories to have come out of the place, which played host to an almost-endless orgy of drink and drugs.</p>
      <p>A Telegraph journalist once described seeing, "supermodels lolling against the fridge, white lines everywhere, and endless gabbing about crop circles and conspiracy theories."</p>
      <p>Noel admitted as much, telling the Independent, "By 1997 it had just gone berserk. I was doing loads of drugs and me and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/liam-gallagher">Liam</a> were just out of control."</p>
      <p>Most of the time he had no idea who the drug-addled hangers-on slumped around his house were.</p>
      <p>Nights merged into days as they "sat there with the curtains closed" debating aliens and moon landings.</p>
      <p>The fridge was stocked with lager, cranberry juice, more lager, half a jar of marmalade and a jug of gone-off Bloody Mary, according to one report. Steve Coogan was on the voicemail.</p>
      <p>And the feral antics of Noel and his glitzy pack infuriated his well-to-do neighbours, who called police after one particularly riotous party.</p>
      <p>Celebrating Noel's 30th birthday, officers found the heavily-refreshed Oasis star and a hoard of his mates crammed onto a coffee table screaming along to the Sex Pistols.</p>

      <p>“All my Pistols tracks, right, have been trashed in this house," Noel once bragged.</p>
      <p>"I’ve got a coffee table downstairs that holds about four ashtrays. There must have been 15 people on it and the police show up and we were going, 'And I wanna be anarchy'. ‘Excuse me, sir, could you turn the noise down?’ It’s the Pistols, man, you know what I mean?”</p>
      <p>But while the boys were bad, Noel claimed the girls were even worse.</p>
      <p>"Meg is hardcore, her and her f***ing girlfriends are worse than any bunch of guys I've ever been out with," he once said.</p>
      <p>"I mean it, man. They are f***ing hardcore rock'n'roll women. They can be a bit scary when they're out, actually."</p>
      <p>Kitted out with sixties retro furniture, bespoke leather beds seventies toilets, psychedelic patterned carpets and one enormous fish tank, the address also housed many a showbiz lodger, including <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kate-moss">Kate Moss</a> .</p>
      <p>In 1997, Noel revealed how he tormented a group of unsuspecting fangirls who turned up wanting the supermodel's autograph.</p>
      <p>"Kate Moss’d be staying here for a couple of weeks and I’ve got loads of shopping, so I’m trying to open the gate and there was these four girls, they’ve got these books and they’re going, ‘Can you get me Kate’s autograph?’" he told radio host Sean Rowley.</p>

      <p>“You’re coming round ‘ere, to my ‘ouse, asking for supermodel’ autographs? You taking the piss, or what? Do you not want mine? Well, I’ll tell you what, you’re not going until you have mine. You’re having my autograph now!</p>
      <p>"I ended up walking up the street going ‘C’mere! No, c’mere! Gimme the book! Gimme the book! ‘No, I don’t want your autograph.’ ‘Gimme me the book!'"</p>
      <p>Hollyoaks actress Davinia Taylor also lived there for a period with then-partner Dave Gardner, and described how she'd pop across the road to Sadie Frost and Jude Law's place to get sozzled.</p>
      <p>"I used to go to Sadie's in my pyjamas with a bottle of - actually, who am I kidding? - a box of wine!" she told The Times.</p>
      <p>One time she was chilling at Supernova Heights when the doorbell whet at 3am. It was Liam Gallagher.</p>
      <p>"He goes, ‘Thank God for this place. It’s like a church, it’s always open,"" she recalled.</p>
      <p>"Crack open a bottle - I’ve got the new Oasis album to play you.'”</p>
      <p>But by 1997, the bad times had started to outweigh the good.</p>
      <p>Noel was suffering from crippling anxiety attacks and realised his drug-taking was "out of control".</p>

      <p>Then an epiphany came on June 5, 1998. Waking up to watch Germany play Greece in the World Cup, he ignored the masses of unknown people rolling joints and racking up lines of cocaine around his house and sat down with a Pot Noodle instead.</p>
      <p>Resolute in his desire to get clean, he sold the house to Davinia and Dave - who sold it to David Walliams in 2005 - and headed off to Thailand for a month with Meg.</p>
      <p>When they arrived back, they moved to the country and took the phone off the hook. Noel was done with drugs and done with his mates.</p>
      <p>He wrote 2000's Where Did It All Go Wrong about that friendship group, admitting he took a time out for "five or six years".</p>
      <p>"We've since all re-acquainted and become friends again. We were all too up in each other's faces 24 hours a day," he said.</p>
      <p>So does he have any regrets about creating one of the most infamous party houses of the decade?</p>
      <p>"I can look back on it and say it was a good time, but I made some fundamental mistakes in my life," he told the Guardian.</p>
      <p>"Getting so involved in that circle of people. Letting my house turn into a nightclub."</p>
