      <p>The <a href="https://www.milenio.com/policia/sonora-ataque-deja-mujer-muerta-sahuaripa">attack </a>took place during the early morning hours on Thursday, according to local reports. The victims were traveling in a pickup in a rural mountain community near the Sonora-Chihuahua border when gunmen opened fire on the outskirts of Sahuaripa.</p>
      <p>Breitbart Texas law enforcement sources say a woman identified as Arcelia Gracia López, 30, and her brother Rodrigo, 40, plus another unidentified adult were traveling to the town of Yécora. While on the road, they came upon a group of gunmen who opened fire–fatally striking Arcelia and wounding Rodrigo. The unidentified adult was uninjured. The assailants then sped away in at least one truck.</p>
      <p>The area around Sahuaripa is approximately 165 miles south from Bavispe, the site of <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/border/2019/11/05/narco-terror-10-u-s-women-children-murdered-by-cartel-gunmen-near-new-mexico-border/">the narco-terror attack</a> that murdered three women and six children near a rural Mormon community.</p>
      <p>The rural mountain communities along the eastern section of Sonora is known for the heavy presence of cartel activity with operatives patrolling unchallenged in convoys of armored vehicles with military-style weapons. Sources recently reported convoys in communities of Sahuaripa, Yécora, Rosario de Tesopaco.</p>
      <p>In August, Breitbart Texas <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/border/2019/08/05/armored-vehicles-with-gun-turrets-captured-near-cartel-camp-in-northern-mexico/">reported</a> when the Mexican Army discovered three trucks equipped with homemade armor–including a cloned police vehicle. The discovery was made near Sahuaripa at a clandestine narco-camp. Two of the modified trucks featured gun turrets.</p>
      <p>According to Breitbart Texas law enforcement sources at the time, investigators were working a series of cartel-related killings in rural Güisamopa and others. The murders were related to a turf war along trafficking routes splitting the Sonora/Chihuahua line.</p>
