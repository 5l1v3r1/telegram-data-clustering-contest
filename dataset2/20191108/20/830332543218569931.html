      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T20:15:54+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 20:15</time> by <a rel="author">Mallory Hughes, CNN</a></address>
      <p>(CNN) - With a combined age of 211 years, one couple in Austin, Texas, has been named the oldest living couple in the world, according to <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/oldest-married-couple-aggregate-age">Guinness World Records</a>.</p>
      <p>John Henderson is 106 and his wife, Charlotte, is 105.</p>
      <p>The Hendersons have a love story that has quite literally stood the test of time. On December 15, they will celebrate 80 years of marriage.</p>
      <p>The two met in class at The University of Texas in 1934. Charlotte was studying to become a teacher, while John was a guard for the football team.</p>
      <p>They married in 1939 during the Great Depression and spent just $7 on the hotel room for their honeymoon.</p>
      <p>In fact, John is also the oldest living former UT football player. For the past 84 years, he's held a tradition of attending at least one Longhorn football game each year.</p>
      <p>Both are still very healthy, and John exercises every day. Ten years ago, the two moved into the Longhorn Village, a senior living community associated with a University of Texas alumni group. Hook 'Em!</p>
      <p>So what's the secret to a long life and happy marriage after all?</p>
      <p>Live life in moderation and be cordial to your spouse, John said.</p>
