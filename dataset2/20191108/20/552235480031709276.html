      <h1>Dundee derby Remembrance Day minute's silence marred by noise and chants</h1>
      <h2>Yobs failed to observe a moment of silence to reflect on the fallen at Dens Park.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T20:04:32+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 20:04</time> by <a rel="author">Jonathan McFarlane</a></address>
      <p>A minute's silence for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/remembrance-day">Remembrance</a> was disrupted by noise and chants before the derby between <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dundee-fc">Dundee</a> and Dundee United.</p>
      <p>Noise was audibly picked up by TV cameras covering the game for BT Sport as the players converged at the centre circle.</p>
      <p>It was unclear which side's supporters failed to observe the moment at Dens Park as the two city rivals prepared to clash in the Championship.</p>
      <p>Once the moment came to an end, boos loudly rang around the stadium as fans registered their displeasure at the behaviour of some within the ground.</p>

      <p>Remembrance is observed on the 11th of November as a commemoration to the dead of World War 1 and other conflicts.</p>
      <p>The two sides clash with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dundee-united-fc">United</a> sitting atop the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-championship">Championship</a> and their rivals desperate to claw back some of the six points that separate them.</p>
