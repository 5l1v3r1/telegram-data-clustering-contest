      <h1>At-home HPV tests up cervical cancer screening</h1>

      <p>Mailed self-sampling kits that test for HPV—the virus that can cause cervical cancer—helped significantly more women get screened for the cancer.</p>
      <p>As reported in <i><a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.14729">JAMA Network Open</a></i>, researchers randomized women who had not had a screening for cervical cancer in more than three years into two groups. They mailed roughly half an HPV self-sampling kit that they could complete as an alternative to Pap screening, and the other half received only the standard care reminders to get a screening in a clinical setting.</p>
      <p>Within the cohort of underscreened women in the self-testing arm of the study, 26% completed a screening for <a href="https://www.futurity.org/vaccine-cervical-cancer-1009192/">cervical cancer</a> versus 17% of underscreened women who received the standard reminders. Of those underscreened women who returned the kits, 88% tested negative for the virus, signaling low risk for cervical cancer.</p>
      <p>“Many studies have shown that an HPV test on a sample that a woman collects for herself performs as well as an HPV test done on a physician-collected sample,” says lead author Rachel Winer, professor of epidemiology at the University of Washington School of Public Health and affiliate investigator at Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute.</p>
      <p>“Randomized trials in other countries have shown that offering home-based HPV testing increases screening participation, but this was the first US trial to study the impact of mailed kits in a real-world health system setting.”</p>
      <h3>At-home HPV test</h3>
      <p>Half of the 12,000 cervical cancers diagnosed annually occur in women who have gone longer than three years without a screening, according to previous studies. That makes these women a high-priority population to screen, the researchers say.</p>
      <p>“We found that mailing unsolicited self-collection kits for <a href="https://www.futurity.org/gardasil-9-hpv-vaccine-1142472/">HPV testing</a> increased cervical cancer screening by 50% in women who were underscreened for cervical cancer, and that’s a particularly hard population to reach,” says coauthor Diana Buist, senior investigator and director of research and strategic partnerships at Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute.</p>
      <p>“So, it’s a good news story,” Buist says. “And now that HPV-only testing is a recognized screening strategy in the United States, it really opens up the possibility for home testing to be a widespread option for women.”</p>
      <h3>Not following up on cervical cancer screening</h3>
      <p>Researchers also wanted to find out whether this high-priority population of women would perform the self-sampling and then, if the sample tested positive for HPV, go in for a follow-up test to determine the presence of precancerous cervical cells that could be treated to prevent cancer.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, the researchers note, while the vast majority of women tested negative for the virus, not all of the participants who tested positive followed up.</p>
      <p>“It’s great that 88% of women who self-sample at home would not need to come into the clinic,” Winer says, “but there’s a key 12% in our trial that were identified to be at increased risk for cervical cancer—and yet only 70% of those women came in for follow-up testing.”</p>
      <p>Consequently, the researchers say, additional implementation efforts need to strategize how to increase use of the kit and in-clinic follow-up for positive results to maximize detection and treatment of pre-cancers in high-risk women.</p>
      <p>“The landscape of cervical cancer screening in the US is changing, and there is a real opportunity to expand options and improve the screening process for women,” Winer says. “I’m hopeful that a few years down the line, <a href="https://www.futurity.org/colorectal-cancer-screening-by-mail-1815792-2/">home-based screening</a> will become routinely available.”</p>
