      <p>(CNN) - What better way to signal the start of the holiday shopping season than with <a href="https://www.oprahmag.com/life/a29537594/oprah-favorite-things-2019/">Oprah Winfrey's list of her favorite things</a>?</p>
      <p>Winfrey has a whopping 79 gifts to recommend for shoppers this year. (That's down from the 107 items she recommended last year.)</p>
      <p>As usual, the long-running list has a range of gifts for pretty much everyone in your life.</p>
      <p>So, whether you're shopping for your loved one or you want to treat yourself, here are the oddest, coolest and most expensive items on her list.</p>

        <b>Piccolina Trailblazer Portrait Tees</b>
      </p>
      <p>These awesome portrait tees with cool designs highlight iconic women such as Ruth Bader-Ginsberg. A portion of the proceeds will go to benefit nonprofit organizations that support girls' education and empowerment, according to the company's website.</p>

        <b>Truff Hot Sauce</b>
      </p>
      <p>Who knew Oprah likes it hot? Truffles with hot sauce sounds like a match made in heaven.</p>

        <b>Courant Catch:2</b>
      </p>
      <p>Tired of plugging your devices in and out to charge them? Ditch the cables and drop your phone or AirPods right on top of the mat to wirelessly charge them while you sleep.</p>
      <h3>Most expensive</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Apple Watch Series 5 ($799)</b>

      <p>
        <b>Prepster Emergency Backpack ($395)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Is Oprah a doomsday prepper? This emergency backpack is quite pricey, but it comes with everything you may need in an emergency, including a pop-up tube tent, charger, rope and even freeze-dried ice cream.</p>
      <p>
