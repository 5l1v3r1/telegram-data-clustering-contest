      <p>The Amazon.com Inc. executive who oversaw the company’s push into brick-and-mortar retail and development of the Kindle e-reader plans to leave early next year, the company confirmed on Friday.</p>
      <p>Steve Kessel, one of Amazon’s longest-serving and most important executives, told his team of the move in an internal email. His planned departure was reported earlier by technology news site GeekWire.</p>
      <p>“It’s hard to leave something I’ve loved doing for so long, inventing alongside a fantastic group of people, but it’s a good time to make this change because of the teams and plans we have in place,” Kessel wrote in the email obtained by GeekWire.</p>
