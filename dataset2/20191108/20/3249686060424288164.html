      <p>Netizens are quick to react after she uploaded an apology video, especially stating that Ellin clearly was showing some attitude throughout the apology video. Comments include: </p>
      <p>
        <i>"The funny thing is she apologizes but doesn't say anything about returning the money. And she denied everything at first but apologized after she was threatened with more reveals."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"So she admits that she's a snake and still earns 1 billion KRW?"</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"Her apology broadcast is more like a make people angry broadcast. She keeps sighing and reading the script as if she's forced to do so. A truly scary person."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"Is she kidding? She steals 1 billion KRW and then releases a 3-minute apology? People like her need to be forgotten."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"She makes it so obvious she doesn't want to apologize throughout the entire video." </i>
      </p>
