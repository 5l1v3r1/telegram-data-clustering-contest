      <p>TROUBLED marine operator Triyards Holdings has received an originating summons and supporting affidavit from OCBC for the company to be placed under judicial management, the company said in a Singapore Exchange filing on Friday evening.</p>
      <p>OCBC is also seeking the appointment of interim judicial managers over the company before the judicial management application is heard. A pre-trial conference for the application is to be held on Nov 28, but no hearing dates have been fixed yet for the judicial management and interim judicial manager applications.</p>
      <p>Triyards said it is assessing the impact of the applications and taking legal advice. It will make further announcements as and when there are any material developments.</p>
      <p>Triyards shares have been suspended from trading since September 2017.</p>
