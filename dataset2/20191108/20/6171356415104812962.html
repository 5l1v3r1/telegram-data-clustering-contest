      <h1>Grab HP's 2-in-1 Chromebook x360 for $349 ($250 off)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-08T20:45:46+00:00">08 Nov 2019, 20:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/david-oh/" target="_blank">David Oh</a></address>
      <p>Among a sea of Chromebooks, some stand out more than others. For example, the 14" HP Chromebook x360 with its clean design, good backlit keyboard, and snappy performance. After debuting at $600, its price has <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/07/05/hp-chromebook-deal/">dipped a few times</a> but not as low as today's sale. At Best Buy, you can now get one for just $349 ($250 off).</p>
      <p>This particular model — 14-DA0011DX — comes with an Intel Core i3 8130U dual-core CPU, 8GB of RAM, a 1080P screen, 64GB of eMMc storage, a backlit keyboard, and a flexible hinge for 360-degree rotation. In terms of ports, HP offers good flexibility: 2x USB-C, 1x USB-A, 1x headphone/mic, and a microSD slot. It only weighs 3.7 lbs. and offers up to 14 hours of battery life.</p>
