      <p>UFC heavyweight contender Derrick Lewis isn’t too fond of Greg Hardy. During his post-UFC 244 scrum after defeating Blagoy Ivanov, “The Black Beast” candidly spoke about his dislike towards “The Prince of War.”</p>
      <p>“I want Greg Hardy to get his ass out of the UFC,” <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/3/20946033/ufc-244-derrick-lewis-i-want-greg-hardy-out-of-the-ufc-heavyweight-mma-news">he told reporters</a>. “He’s making everyone else look bad. So, we don’t need him to win no more fights.”</p>
      <p>Currently in Moscow for his co-headliner fight against Alexander Volkov, Hardy fired back at Lewis, hitting at the latter’s <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2018/11/2/18054596/ufc-230-daniel-cormier-derrick-lewis-is-a-little-smarter-than-you-guys-think-heavyweight-mma-news">three-year prison stint</a> as a younger man.</p>
      <p>“I think he’s like a felon,” Hardy said of Lewis in an interview with RT Sport (via <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/11/8/20954191/greg-hardy-derrick-lewis-hes-been-to-prison-i-dont-think-hes-allowed-to-say-what-the-standard-is">MMA Fighting</a>). “He’s been to prison. I just don’t think somebody that’s been to prison is allowed to say what the standard is... We don’t listen to people that contradict themselves.”</p>
      <p>Hardy stirred up controversy at UFC Boston in mid-October for using an inhaler mid-fight. After <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/10/19/20921996/ufc-boston-greg-hardy-explains-inhaler-use-it-doesnt-help-me-breathe-better-mma-news">defending his actions right after it happened</a>, he is now dismissing it as a rookie mistake.</p>
      <p>“I’m a rookie, things happen. I didn’t know,” he said. “They said I could. It’s all in the past. It was a smaller deal than it should’ve been and everybody’s kind of over it.”</p>
      <p>UFC Moscow takes place on Saturday, November 9th. Headlining the card is a featherweight fight between Zabit Magomedsharipov and Calvin Kattar.</p>
