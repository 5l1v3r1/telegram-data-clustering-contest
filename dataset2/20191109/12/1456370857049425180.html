        <b>Five Years Ago</b>
      </p>
      <p>This week in 2014, while congress was gearing up to push a <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141101/08094329016/congress-wants-to-push-dangerous-cybersecurity-bill-after-election-says-us-economy-depends-it.shtml">dangerous cybersecurity bill</a> and one court was telling the DOJ that <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141031/15383329006/court-tells-us-govt-that-state-secrets-isnt-magic-wand-they-can-wave-to-make-embarrassing-cases-go-away.shtml">"state secrets" isn't a magic wand</a>, we were hoping an important lawsuit about NSA surveillance would <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141104/14333029039/heres-hoping-judge-ignore-nutty-plaintiff-with-important-case-nsa-surveillance-business-records.shtml">go forward despite the nutty plaintiff</a>. A former NSA lawyer was hilariously warning Google and Apple that <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141104/15480529040/former-nsa-lawys-stewart-baker-thinks-reason-blackberry-failed-was-too-much-encryption.shtml">Blackberry failed because of 'too much encryption'</a>, while James Comey was just <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141105/10194529056/james-comey-again-demands-tech-companies-do-as-he-says-grant-fbi-complete-access-to-whatever-it-wants.shtml">angrily demanding backdoor keys</a>, and in the UK the GCHQ was straight-up <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141103/12113329028/new-gchq-boss-blames-tech-industry-facilitating-murder-being-terrorists-command-and-control-center.shtml">blaming the tech industry for facilitating murder</a>.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Ten Years Ago</b>
      </p>
      <p>This very same week in 2009, the Obama administration was <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20091102/0427036763.shtml">playing the "state secrets" card</a> in a warrantless wiretapping case, not long after promising to change its state secret practices. Meanwhile, the MPAA was <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20091103/0434486780.shtml">telling the FCC that file sharing would kill the internet</a>, hot on the heels of getting <i>60 Minutes</i> to air a full show of <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20091101/1818186751.shtml">unalloyed MPAA propaganda about piracy</a> — even as <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20091101/2005096753.shtml">yet more studies</a> were showing file sharers buy more media (just like how <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20091101/2150456755.shtml">DVRs were helping, not hurting, TV</a>) and attacks on file sharing <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20091103/1744406785.shtml">just drive people further underground</a>. But the latest leaks showed the copyright folks were planning on getting their way in one place: <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20091103/1308526784.shtml">ACTA, which was looking like an entertainment industry wishlist</a>.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Fifteen Years Ago</b>
      </p>
      <p>This week in 2004, long before today's concerns about social media and politics, the big question was <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20041101/0113203.shtml">if political spam could influence elections</a>. The MPAA was in the news too, foolishly following in the RIAA's footsteps and <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20041103/1952239.shtml">suing 200 file sharers</a> — while DVRs were <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20041101/155247.shtml">just starting to truly catch on</a>. Phones were transforming tech with <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20041101/1147252.shtml">voicemail on the way out in favour of SMS</a> and camera phone photos <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20041103/0955246.shtml">showing up on the front pages of newspapers</a>. And the broadband providers were still fighting their vicious fight to ensure <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20041102/0956205.shtml">municipal broadband never happens</a>.</p>
