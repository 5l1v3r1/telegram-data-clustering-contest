      <p>Doja Cat has had so many wins the past few months that <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/doja-cat-delivers-sophomore-effort-hot-pink-ft-tyga-gucci-mane-and-smino-new-mixtape.119749.html">the arrival of her new album, <i>Hot Pink</i></a>, marked an opportunity to solidify herself as a hitmaker. Riding off the success of her infectious collaboration with Rico Nasty, "Tia Tamera", Doja dropped the repost-friendly music video for "Juicy" with an added <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/Tyga/profile">Tyga</a> verse. A few weeks ago, she released the single, "Rules", with another video that had people praising her for putting effort into a craft that so many artists have tragically abandoned.</p>
      <p>Lo and behold, <i>Hot Pink</i> delivered. It's a bubbly blend of hip hop, pop and R&amp;B that has potential to spawn more hits and more colourful visuals. The first half of the album is a relentless sequence of bops, the strongest of them possibly being the <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/guccimane/profile">Gucci Mane</a>-assisted "Like That". Doja bestows her verse with her usual charisma, while giving a sensual exhale for the chorus. Gucci pops in for a brief appearance that certainly adds to the fun - hearing his ad-libs prepare you for his imminent verse is always a pleasure.</p>
