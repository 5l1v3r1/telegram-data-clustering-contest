      <p>Suarez's contract with Barcelona runs until 2021, but at the age of 32, the club have reportedly set their sights on a number of potential targets.</p>
      <p>Seattle Sounders attacker Nico Lodeiro is a good friend of Suarez after playing alongside the Barca forward for Uruguay over the years.</p>
      <p>Lodeiro has since revealed that Suarez has been asking him about the league.</p>
      <p>“I think you need to convince Barcelona. He (Suarez) wants to come to MLS,” Lodeiro told MLSsoccer.com.</p>
      <p>“He is always asking me about the league.</p>
      <p>"His dream was to play for Barcelona. He’s playing at a great level and he feels comfortable there.</p>
      <p>“Sooner or later he’ll come to MLS. Well, hopefully! He likes the league. He’s always asking me things about it. Hopefully he can also play for Seattle Sounders. It may be a more difficult task.</p>
      <p>"I think it’s only a matter of time before he’s out here.”</p>
