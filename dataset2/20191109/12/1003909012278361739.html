      <h3>Children will be left behind by cuts</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Re: It’s never enough for the CBE, letter, Nov. 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>As a retired teacher, I am following with great interest the UCP’s attempts to control its spending. Readers who are assuming that any school board can absorb the significant cuts the UCP are proposing are oblivious to the realities of the education world.</p>
      <p>Those with children should brace for the mid-year reorganization that will need to be implemented to try to keep expenses within budgets: bigger classes, more split classes, fewer assistants, less access to services, quality teachers let go, students separated from their friends mid-year, etc. Many students will adapt to these more crowded environments. They can do it on their own.</p>
      <p>Others will be left to fend for themselves, and fall even more behind. All this in an environment where teachers are already trying to cope with so many students who are already in need of individualize attention.</p>
      <p>Will your child be left behind? Is that the price you, the parents, are willing to pay to balance the books? Good luck.</p>

      <h3>Let’s remember the horrors of the Second World War</h3>
      <p>Leading up to and on Nov. 11, I try to come up with some way to reflect on it. This year I thought I’d look at some numbers for perspective. Around 75 to 80 million died, including civilians and soldiers, in the Second World War. That was around three percent of the world’s population of 2.3 billion souls in 1940.</p>
      <p>Today we have 7.7 Billion people. Three percent of 7.7 billion is 231 million. My sister was born in 1945 and I am the 4th child in 1955. Both our parents were in, met and married in the war.</p>
      <p>Maybe we can at least ponder the numbers and perhaps even some long lost relatives. Let’s not do it again.</p>

      <h3>Travellers should think twice before driving in the U.K.</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Re: Calgary philanthropist Carey killed in U.K. crash, Nov 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>In the U.K. this summer, 19-year-old Harry Dunn was killed when his motorbike collided with a car that was being driven on the wrong side of the road by an American diplomat’s wife, Anne Sacoolas. Now Ron Carey has been tragically killed because he took a wrong turn onto the M23 motorway in a vintage car.</p>
      <p>It is so ingrained in us to drive on the right that a split-second lapse in concentration takes you there automatically. Think about being on the “wrong” side of the road across roundabouts, mini-roundabouts or five mini-roundabouts arranged in a circle around a sixth. Or driving along winding, hedge-lined, single-lane roads with traffic coming at you at 90 km/h and nowhere to pull over.</p>
      <p>Do you know there’s no equivalent of our turn-right-on-a-red and you can only pass on the right? The shear volume and proximity of the vehicles there is unlike anything we have in Canada. Please travellers, think twice before you attempt to drive in the U.K.</p>
