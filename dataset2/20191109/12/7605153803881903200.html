        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 9 – Kariobangi Sharks defender Amani Kyata turned the ball into his won net in the 89<sup>th</sup> minute to gift Kisumu All Stars their maiden Kenyan premier League victory with a 1-0 win in Kisumu on Saturday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In eight matches, All Stars had only picked up three points from three draws and were second from bottom of the pile, but the victory over the dull Sharks ensured they added a W to their statistics to move to 16<sup>th</sup> in the standings.</p>
      <p>Sharks meanwhile continued with their slump in form and dropped back to 15<sup>th</sup> in the log after losing their third match in four outings to increase the pressure on head coach William Muluya.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Tusker FC needed a stoppage time penalty to play to a 1-1 draw with KCB at the Afraha Stadium in Nakuru to move two points clear on top of the standings.</p>
      <p>Timothy Otieno stepped up to the pressure cooker to slot home in added time after a handball inside the box, cancelling out Reegan Otieno’s earlier goal.</p>
      <p>The bankers had to play almost one hour of the match with a man less after defender Bethwell Warambo was sent off midway through the second half after a second yellow card.</p>
      <p>The victory saw Tusker move to 17 points, two ahead of Gor Mahia and AFC Leopards who clash tomorrow in the Mashemeji Derby while KCB remained fourth with 15 points as well but an inferior goal difference.</p>
      <p>Posta Rangers meanwhile moved to fifth in the standings after a 3-0 thrashing of Chemelil Sugar in Narok.</p>
      <p>Charles Odette and Francis Nambute scored to give the mailmen a comfortable 2-0 half time lead before  skipper Joseph Mbugi converted a penalty six minutes after the restart to seal the win.</p>
