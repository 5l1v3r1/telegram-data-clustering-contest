      <h1>Barcelona president preparing to deal with the post-Messi era</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T12:18:27+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 12:18</time> by <a rel="author">Nishant Narayanan</a></address>
      <h3>Barcelona President, Josep Maria Bartomeu, in an interview with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2019/11/09/sports/soccer/ap-soc-barcelona-life-after-messi.html"><b>The Associated Press</b></a>, has admitted that the club is preparing for the inevitable life without Lionel Messi.</h3>
      <p>The Captain of Barcelona has yet again been a marquee player for the Spanish champions this season. The 32-year-old has not been affected by his age and continues to display his remarkable talent every time he steps out on the pitch. But the reality of the matter is that the Argentine’s contract expires in 2021 and even has a clause that allows him to leave next summer.</p>
      <p>Although it is unlikely that Leo will leave Blaugrana in the summer, Bartomeu admits that the club has already started their preparation for the eventual departure of the Argentine international.</p>
      <p>Josep Bartomeu told The Associated Press in an interview on Friday</p>
      <blockquote>“In the next coming two or three seasons our leader will continue to be Leo Messi,”<br/><br/>“But it’s true that there are other young players who are coming. Players coming from abroad, but also players coming from our La Masia (academy). And we are very happy because we are preparing this post-Messi era.”</blockquote>
      <p>Messi is Barcelona’s all-time leading scorer, having scored 609 goals in 697 appearances, along with assisting 236 more. In his 15 years with Barca, Leo has managed to lead the team to 34 trophies. He remains the team’s undisputed top goalscorer and passer of the ball. Adored by millions of Barcelona fans around the world, Messi will forever be in the hearts of all footballing fans.</p>
      <p>Bartomeu stated that a crucial part of the clubs transition will be to ensure that Messi retires in a Barca shirt, and also stays linked to it after his playing days are over.</p>
      <blockquote>“I have no doubts that after Messi finishes his career as footballer he will remain linked to this club for the rest of his life.”</blockquote>
      <p>While confident that Barcelona will always remain a top team, fans around the world are concerned over the club’s ability to cope with the loss of their greatest player ever.</p>
      <p>With current superstars like<a href="https://everythingbarca.com/2019/11/07/champions-league-superstar-located-as-luis-suarezs-replacement/"><b> Luis Suárez</b></a>, <a href="https://everythingbarca.com/2019/11/03/barcelona-scouting-for-gerard-piques-replacement/"><b>Gerard Pique</b></a>, Jordi Alba and Sergio Busquets all crossing 30, the Spanish giants have an important rebuilding ahead of them.</p>
      <p>Blaugrana’s recent show in the transfer market only confirms their attempts to find replacements for the future, with new arrivals like Ousmane Dembélé,<a href="https://everythingbarca.com/2019/11/09/valverde-sheds-light-on-new-arrivals-snub/"><b> Junior Firpo</b></a>, Jean-Clair Todibo, <a href="https://everythingbarca.com/2019/11/06/the-concerning-omission-of-arthur-melo/"><b>Arthur Melo</b></a> and Frenkie de Jong joining the club.</p>
      <p>Valverde has given La Masia graduates their fair share of first-team action to ensure their growth as prospects. Players like Ansu Fati, Carles Pérez, Ronald Araújo, and Carles Aleñá all being given senior minutes this season.</p>
      <p>Can you imagine the current Barcelona without Lionel Messi?</p>
