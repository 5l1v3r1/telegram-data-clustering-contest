      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T12:25:43+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 12:25</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Kitching, Charlotte Penketh-King, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/chris-kitching/</a></address>
      <p>A British couple are believed to be among the injured after a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/coach-crashes">tour bus</a> plunged down an embankment near a famous beach in Thailand.</p>
      <p>Holidaymakers were catapulted from the open-sided vehicle and "strewn in the middle of the road" on their way to Paradise Beach on the island of Phuket.</p>
      <p>The roof was torn off and the driver was "barely conscious" after the bus left the road on a steep hill just after 1pm local time on Saturday.</p>
      <p>An eyewitness said that between eight and 10 passengers, mainly British and French, were injured, including a couple from the UK.</p>
      <p>Two ambulances were called to help the injured group and the bus driver, who had to be carried from the wreckage.</p>

      <p>A witness said: "I was just heading for lunch when I heard a massive crash and lots of screaming.</p>
      <p>"Everyone rushed from the beach to find that a bus carrying tourists had lost control on a steep hill and crashed into the embankment.</p>
      <p>"It is in the hills which are extremely steep, it's the only way you can reach the resort, and it appears that the driver lost control halfway down the final slope.</p>

      <p>"There were about eight to 10 passengers - French and British tourists - and people were thrown from the bus when it crashed.</p>
      <p>"The bus was smashed into the side of the hill and the roof was torn completely off and strewn in the middle of the road."</p>
      <p>The witness added: "Everyone was very shaken up and most of the tourists got taken to the hospital with injuries with two ambulances arriving not long after the crash.</p>
      <p>"The driver had to be carried out of the bus by a group of people, he was barely conscious."</p>
      <p>Paradise Beach has long been a popular tourist destination for holidaymakers in Thailand with its famed white sand and clear waters.</p>
      <p>Part of the new <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/netflix">Netflix</a> movie Paradise Beach was filmed at the resort.</p>
