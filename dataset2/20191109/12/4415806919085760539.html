      <p>A heavily indebted man seeking to make a false insurance claim has confessed to setting off explosions which killed three firefighters at his house in north-west Italy, prosecutors have said.</p>
      <p>Giovanni Vincenti told investigators he meant to blow up his farmhouse in the Piedmont region by setting off gas canisters, but he allegedly made a mistake with a timer and triggered two explosions, according to prosecutor Enrico Cieri.</p>
      <p>Firefighters went to the property in Quargnento, near Alessandria, after the initial explosion early on Tuesday and were then struck by a second, stronger blast.</p>
      <p>Vincenti was detained on Friday night. At a news conference on Saturday morning, Mr Cieri said Vincenti told investigators he had no intention of killing the firefighters.</p>

      <p>The prosecutor said Vincenti could have prevented the deaths by telling firefighters tackling the first fire that there were more gas canisters in the house.</p>
      <p>Mr Cieri said investigators found a manual for the timer in Vincenti’s bedroom. Vincenti’s wife is also under investigation.</p>
      <p>Sky TG24 reported that the farm building had been renovated and had been up for sale for two years.</p>
      <p>Funerals were held for the firefighters on Friday, attended by Italian premier Giuseppe Conte and other dignitaries.</p>
      <p>Three other first responders were injured. One of the dead firefighters was buried under rubble, with the body only recovered after hours of digging.</p>
