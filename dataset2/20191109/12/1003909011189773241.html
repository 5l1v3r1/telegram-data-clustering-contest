      <h1>Brooks: Monsters and Martinis grants kids wishes</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T12:00:45+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Bill Brooks, Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>It was 27 years ago that Dave Stinton attended a conference in Vancouver featuring a presentation from the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Stinton was understandably moved hearing about the foundation’s wishes granted to children with life-threatening medical conditions. When he headed home to Calgary, he discussed with this wife Carol the possibility of starting a foundation chapter in southern Alberta. Fast forward to 1995 when the Stinton’s founded the Make-A-Wish Foundation Southern Alberta. The first wish was granted to a five-year-old girl from Medicine Hat. She wanted a purple playhouse because she liked Barney, and a wagon so that when she couldn’t walk, her brother could pull her in the wagon to her playhouse. And the foundation has never looked back and continues to enrich the human experience with hope, strength and joy for those children who need it most.</p>
      <p>Wishes cost, on average, about $10,000. That the foundation’s inaugural Monsters and Martinis event, held Oct. 26 at Hotel Arts, raised more than $45,000 ensures at least four wishes will be granted.</p>
      <p>Guests in attendance this night dressed in their Halloween finest included: Lynne Douglas, event chair, board member Make-A-Wish Canada and Sprung Structures regional business development manager; Doug Pinder, Raymond James senior vice-president and branch manager, private client group; Jeff Bowling, Canadian Western Bank, senior vice-president and regional general manger, Prairie region and Make-A-Wish Foundation Southern Alberta board chair with his wife Andrea Bowling; Marlie and Steve Burtt; Strategic Group CEO Riaz Mamdani with Kate Abbot and colleagues Strategic Group president Randy Ferguson and CFO Graham Garner; volunteer committee members Mary Ann Steen and Lynne Clost; foundation CEO Kim Anthony; emcee Jonathan Love and his wife Kate Love; Edges Salon &amp; Spa’s Jessica Graham and Mandie Chammoury; Kenn Borek Air’s Daniel Graham; CLS Landscape Supply’s Cam Bahan; Edge School for Athletics’ Taylor Rudkin; Morgan Embury; CWB’s Valerie Gingras with Canmore Woodcrafting’s Axel Griesshaber; Pattison Outdoor’s Adam Seeley; Lisa Maragh; and the star of the evening, Wish Child, Andreas and his mom, Terri. Andreas’ wish to go on a Mediterranean cruise was granted last summer.</p>
