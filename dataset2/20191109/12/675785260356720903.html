      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T12:07:44+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 12:07</time> by <a rel="author">Louise Randell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/louise-randell/</a></address>
      <p>Robbie Williams has said <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/coleen-rooney">Coleen Rooney</a> was blinded by lust for "revenge" in her plan to publicly shame Rebekah Vardy.</p>
      <p>Coleen, 33, outed Jamie Vardy's wife as part of an elaborate scheme to expose a mole who had been leaking stories from her private <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> account to the press.</p>
      <p>After the WAGatha Christie row went public, pregnant Rebekah, 37, was bombarded with sickening abuse from trolls even though she denied she was behind the leaks.</p>
      <p>Take That star Robbie has now waded into the drama and insisted Coleen was wrong to subject Rebekah to such public torment.</p>
      <p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/">The Telegraph Magazine</a> : Robbie explained: "Let's say Rebekah was guilty - which we don't know.</p>
      <p>"How she will feel inside right now is 10 times worse than how Coleen would have felt when those things were happening to her...</p>

      <p>"It's a dangerous game to play... I understand Coleen's need for revenge and I probably would have done the same thing but we have to be careful...</p>
      <p>"It's suicide-causing - provoking those levels of shame."</p>
      <p>Rebekah and her footballer husband Jamie were forced to cut their recent holiday to Dubai short when she was accused of selling stories on fellow WAG Coleen.</p>
      <p>Coleen claimed to have planted false stories on her private <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> account and revealed she'd blocked every account but Rebekah's to test whether or not the information would leak.</p>

      <p>When the storied found their way into a national newspaper, Coleen told the world what had happened in a bombshell statement that went viral.</p>
      <p>Rebekah vehemently denied leaking stories and said she was "disgusted" that she was facing such claims when heavily pregnant.</p>
      <p>She has since claimed to have hired a forensic IT expert to prove her innocence and is considering legal action.</p>
