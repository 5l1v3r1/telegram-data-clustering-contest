      <p>Did you hear that Disney is creating a new streaming channel? Yep, in this age of endless streaming "options" you can subscribe to Disney+ starting Tuesday, which will run you $6.99 a month and grant you access to a bunch of old Disney/<i>Star Wars</i>/Marvel content and a ton of new TV and film projects going forward.</p>
      <p>As a note, you can grab an app for the service next week on PS4 and Xbox One, as well as all of the devices below (Switch hasn't entered the streaming game...yet?!). Amazon Fire TV was just added to the list a few days ago, as Disney and Amazon finally struck a deal that satisfied both parties (for a while there it seemed like it was going to be one of the only nixed devices).</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Amazon Fire TV</li>
        <li>Android</li>
        <li>Apple TV</li>
        <li>Chromecast</li>
        <li>iOS</li>
        <li>LG Smart TVs</li>
        <li>PS4</li>
        <li>Roku</li>
        <li>Samsung Smart TVs</li>
        <li>Xbox</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I've had media access to Disney+ for a bit, and as expected, most of the content is geared toward families.</p>
      <p><i>Lady and the Tramp</i> is a not-bad live action film so long as you're expecting nothing more than a carefree hour and a half romp, <i>The Imagineering Story</i> is an in-depth, well-crafted (if one-sided) look at Disney history, and <i>The World According to Jeff Goldblum</i> is basically a "background noise" show like Guy Fieri's<i> Diner's Drive-ins and Dives</i>, if Guy also covered jeans, sneakers and tattoos. Screeners for <i>The Mandalorian</i> were not provided to most media "for fear of spoilers," but that could also mean something else, as we all know by now having witnessed a bunch of game review embargoes come and go.</p>
      <p>Having full access to <i>The Simpsons</i>, ad-free for the first time in its entirety (man <i>Simpsons World</i> sucked), will make up for it I'm sure.</p>
