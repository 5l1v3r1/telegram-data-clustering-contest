      <p><b>KARACHI: </b>Following their achievements in <i>Pepsi Battle of the Bands </i>(<i>BoB</i>) and the release of their song, <i>Paisa Phenk</i>, Tamaasha had sparked a campaign on social media, which aimed to target the exploitation of artists in the industry. Following this, the band announced a music video for their original song which they performed in BoB, <i>Roshni </i>and recently dropped its teaser.</p>

      <p>Although the inter-galactic tease has left its viewers space-bound, Bilal Ahmad the lead vocalist of Tamaasha, told <i>The Express Tribune</i> that it was not something they suddenly decided to do. This is because the video is based on a song which has already done several rounds on social media.</p>
      <p>“We always knew we had to do a studio production of <i>Roshni</i>, and audiences have been shouting for a music video all the same. Working with Pepsi, we figured this is the best time for the song to come out in all its glory,” said Ahmad. Nevertheless, he went on to reassure his fans, stating, “More tracks will be coming out soon, nonetheless.”</p>

      <p>As for the video, the singer claimed that the video will not only rely on its sci-fi vision to engage the audience but will also carry a relative storyline. “There will definitely be a storyline involved, given that Tamaasha, in its essence, is a show. However, we figured we will take a different path to it this time, as opposed to the raw, energetic performance in <i>Paisa Phenk</i>. The audience will witness some outer space visuals, Tamaasha’s very own spaceship, and the planet we’re landing on for a mission,” Ahmad added.</p>

      <p>The band also explained how the video was an intense project and something most filmmakers would shy away from. “Call it brash ambition, or risk taking but we knew that this is what <i>Roshni</i> asked for,” he stated. He further claimed that the project took two months to complete, regardless of the time consumed in the post production phase.</p>
      <p>“The project was planned and shot in less than 2 months, and we had the best team working for us, who we are proud to call family. Our bassist, Ali Raza, served as the Director for the video, with Shahriyar Ali and Dawar Naeem producing. Noor Muhammad Turk was the Director of Production while Kuliyat Masroor and Syed Sajjad Shah were the Assistant Directors and Eruj Hadi served as the Production Designer,” mentioned Ahmad.</p>

      <p>He concluded, “We hope the audience will witness a grand, visual spectacle; something that Pakistanis can own as a product of their own industry.”</p>
      <p>Initially when the band performed this song in <i>Pepsi BoB</i>, the judges could not stop lauding the band for their collective effort. Fawad Khan said that the band is making a joke out of them by performing so well, given their mature sound and composition, along with the exemplary lyrics.</p>

      <p>Meesha Shafi on the other hand went onto say that the band does not require the (Pepsi’s) platform to make a name for themselves. Prior to this, the entire jury, including Faisal Kapadia and Bilal Maqsood from Strings, gave the band a standing ovation, while Fawad actually jumped on his table to express his pride in the musicians.</p>
