      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T22:58:40+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 22:58</time> by <a rel="author">Owen S. Good</a></address>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/need-for-speed-heat/40594"><i>Need for Speed Heat</i></a>, the elephant <i>not </i>in the room is microtransactions. Don’t get me wrong, having a clean game, free of that kind of icky, pocket-picking influence, is a fundamentally a good thing. But the fact EA launched this without any microtransaction marketplace is the strongest sign the publisher has little to no expectations for it. This may <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/1/30/3934302/electronic-arts-taking-medal-of-honor-out-of-the-rotation">go the way of the Medal of Honor series</a>.</p>
      <p>Flashback:<i> </i><a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/need-for-speed-payback/39862"><i>Need for Speed Payback</i></a><i> </i><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/11/11/16636968/need-for-speed-payback-review">launched in 2017 </a>alongside <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/star-wars-battlefront-2/39700"><i>Star Wars Battlefront 2</i></a><i> </i><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/11/13/16639542/loot-crates-battlefront-2-reviews">with a similar loot-box model</a> — random draws, available for real money, that upgrade your experience and drive your career progression. But, because it wasn’t <a href="https://www.polygon.com/franchise/star-wars/741">Star Wars</a>, and also because <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/need-for-speed/39111">Need for Speed</a> didn’t have a companion movie launching at the same time, fewer lawmakers in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/11/22/16690182/battlefront-2-loot-crates-hawaii-belgium-banned-regulation-investigate">Hawaii, Belgium</a> and elsewhere noticed.</p>
      <p>EA’s product focus during Andrew Wilson’s tenure as CEO has been software-as-a-service. The publisher’s games — even <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/nba-live-19/40380"><i>NBA Live 19</i></a><i> — </i>have had to show some kind of open-ended revenue model. Titles like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/franchise/ncaa-football/1203">NCAA Football</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/ea-sports-ufc/13352">EA Sports UFC</a> forced in Ultimate Team modes, no matter how incongruent that concept is with the sport being played.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/franchise/need-for-speed/688"><i>Need for Speed</i></a><i> Heat </i>has zero microtransactions at launch. Again: good thing! But it’s perverse that, in 2019, a mainstream observer could see that meaning it’s a stepchild product to the publisher. And unless you think I’m being too inside-baseball with that analysis, Target <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/6/20951410/black-friday-cyber-monday-2019-target-gaming-deals">already put out a Black Friday ad</a> discounting the game to $35 <i>one week before its release</i>.</p>
      <p>I can remember <a href="https://kotaku.com/need-for-speed-undercover-review-youre-not-good-and-5093090">sludging through <i>Need for Speed: Undercover </i>a decade ago</a> and being <i>grateful</i> that I could buy the Bugatti Veyron to blow by the rubber-banding police pursuit and finally finish the son of a bitch. <i>Need for Speed Heat </i>doesn’t even offer that. There <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/need-for-speed-heat-will-never-have-loot-boxes/">may be some DLC car packs later on</a>, but at this point, it’s a total throwback. Everything on the disc, unlockable, like we’re back in 2005 or something.</p>
      <p>I agree, given all of the specialty press’s coverage and scolding of microtransactions and premium DLC, that it may be unfair of me to interpret this first as a corporate lack of confidence, rather than celebrate <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNeed-for-Speed-Heat-PlayStation-4-Electronic-Arts-014633738452%2F321353052&amp;subid1=polygon"><i>Need for Speed Heat</i></a><i> </i>as a high-value product that all gamers should enjoy. I <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/11/8/20954105/need-for-speed-heat-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc-release-dates">stand behind my review</a>, the racing systems are enjoyable, the progression is understandable, it’s kinda grindy, but so is <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/death-stranding/39186"><i>Death Stranding</i></a><i> </i>and <i>Need for Speed Heat </i>at least has more payoff earlier in the game.</p>
      <p>But still, this the landscape that EA and its peers have shaped over the past decade. If a game launches with a big microtransaction component, they think they have a winner. If it doesn’t ... well ...</p>
