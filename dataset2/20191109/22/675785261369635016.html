      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: US prosecutors believe they have enough evidence to arrest former aides of US tycoon Jeffeey Epstein, found hanged in his prison cell in August while awaiting trial</h2>

      <p>FBI agents are poised to arrest at least four people alleged to have groomed underage girls for Prince Andrew’s paedophile friend Jeffrey Epstein, a legal source said.</p>
      <p>But the insider said Andrew was not among the suspects.</p>
      <p>One of Epstein’s alleged victims Virginia Giuffre has claimed the financier “trafficked” her to the Duke of York and she had sex with him when she was 17.</p>
      <p>The prince, 59, has called the claims “false and without foundation” and said he was “appalled” by Epstein’s alleged crimes.</p>
      <p>It was revealed US prosecutors believe they have enough evidence to arrest former aides of the US tycoon, 66.</p>

      <p>The source said: “They are ready to ask a judge to issue arrest warrants which will, I understand, be acted on immediately.</p>
      <p>“The FBI is targeting those suspected of being involved specifically in the recruitment of underage girls in America, Britain and even Brazil.”</p>
      <p>If convicted, they could face life behind bars.</p>

      <p>The insider added: “I doubt any will be offered the opportunity of a plea bargain deal based on the gravity of the offences and high profile of this case.</p>
      <p>But some could be handed less severe sentences if they cooperate.</p>
      <p>“Who knows how far up the food chain this investigation will eventually go? I have no doubt there will be less significant players willing to drop the hammer on those above.”</p>
      <p>Giuffre, 35, is one of several women who claim Epstein abused them.</p>
      <p>He was found hanged in his cell in August while awaiting trial.</p>
      <p>His brother Mark says he could have been murdered.</p>
