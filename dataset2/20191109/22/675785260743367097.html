      <p>The boyfriend of murdered Girl Scout Jodie Chesney is still distraught about the senseless killing.</p>
      <p>Eddie Coyle, 18, held dying 17-year-old Jodie in his arms after she was knifed in the back in a park eight months ago.</p>
      <p>Eddie’s mum Cylla says her son is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, adding: “His pain is raw. It has devastated our lives.”</p>
      <p>He has quit both his sixth-form studies and his job as he struggles to deal with the unprovoked stabbing.</p>
      <p>Speaking at her home, where purple ribbons are tied to the door as a tribute to Jodie, who loved the colour, Cylla said: “He’s now got PTSD and anxiety and doesn’t go out much. This has torn us apart.”</p>
      <p>Jodie and Eddie, who were studying at the same college, were with friends at Harold Hill in Romford, east London, when she was attacked from behind in a case of mistaken identity.</p>
      <p>She screamed, fell into Eddie’s arms and died before arriving at hospital.</p>

      <p>Svenson Ong-a-Kwie, 19, from Collier Row, East London, and a 17-year-old boy who cannot be named for legal reasons, were convicted of murder on Thursday. During the trial at the Old Bailey, the killers blamed each other.</p>
      <p>They will be sentenced on November 18. Manuel Petrovic, 20, of Romford, and a 16-year-old boy, who also cannot be named, were both cleared of murder and manslaughter.</p>
      <p>Eddie had to relive the horrific attack when he gave evidence at the trial. His mum has told how she has seen him change since the killing.</p>

      <p>Cylla, 43, from Romford, said: “In the daytime he just sleeps... he is up most nights with his anxiety.</p>
      <p>“He doesn’t want to see counsellors and he doesn’t want to speak to anyone, but he does speak to me about it. He’s not working and he’s not at college. He was meant to be doing his A-levels.</p>
      <p>“I’m really lucky in the sense that he’s not a victim, in the sense that he wants to move forward. But obviously he’s up against the anxiety and PTSD. It has put our lives on hold.”</p>

      <p>Jodie’s heartbroken dad Peter Chesney, 39, welcomed the guilty verdicts but said the murder has destroyed his life.</p>
      <p>Jodie’s 20-year-old sister Lucy wrote in a victim impact statement that since the killing she has been “dreading my life rather than looking forward to it”.</p>
      <p>Cylla, who is in contact with Jodie’s devastated relatives, revealed: “I had never met [her] family until this happened. They are so nice.”</p>
