      <p>Woody Allen and Amazon have ended their legal battle.</p>
      <p>The filmmaker had sued Amazon in February after the online giant ended his 2017 contract without ever releasing a completed film A Rainy Day In New York.</p>
      <p>Amazon had responded that Allen, whose daughter Dylan has accused him of molesting her when she was a girl, breached the four-movie deal by making insensitive remarks about the #MeToo movement.</p>
      <p>Allen has repeatedly the allegations made by his daughter.</p>

      <p>In papers filed on Friday in US District Court, Allen and Amazon agreed that the case should be dismissed without prejudice.</p>
      <p>Terms were not disclosed.</p>
      <p>A Rainy Day In New York was released overseas, but not in the US.</p>
      <p>Allenâ€™s career has slowed in recent years, with several actors who had appeared in his films saying they would not work with him again.</p>
