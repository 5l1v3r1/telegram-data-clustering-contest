      <p>Barcelona beat Celta Vigo 4-1 on Saturday and Sergio Busquets scored the fourth and spoke to media after the game. Here are his key quotes:</p>
      <p><b>On Messi:</b> It’s clear that when it’s so close we have the advantage of having the best player in the world and the best free-kick taker in the world. He’s been improving and that’s an advantage, I hope he keeps scoring them.</p>
      <p><b>On pressure: </b>We know where we are and if we don’t win it will create doubts, even more if you don’t play well. Here the pressure is big because this is the best club in the world. You’re either flying or you’re in crisis. We know where we are and we have the same idea as always.</p>
      <p><b>His goal:</b> "It's been a while since I scored but in the end it was irrelevant, what was important was the win. We came from a slip up in Liga and a draw in the Champions, which was not what we wanted. It's important to stay leaders and enter the international break with more calm.</p>
