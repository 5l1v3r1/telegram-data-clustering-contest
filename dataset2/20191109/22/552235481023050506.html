      <h1>Jack Ross latest as Hibs and Hearts target sets date for talks with Easter Road chiefs</h1>
      <h2>Ross is still the top tip for the post despite also being lined up for an interview with Hearts.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T22:29:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 22:29</time> by <a rel="author">Gordon Waddell, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/gordon-waddell/</a></address>
      <p>Harry Kewell officially made his pitch to be the next Hibs boss – but he’s still behind <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jack-ross">Jack Ross</a> in the running.</p>
      <p>The Champions League-winning former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool </a>and Leeds idol was in Perth to watch the Easter Road side romp to a 4-1 win over St Johnstone.</p>
      <p>And despite his management CV with Crawley Town and Notts County being limited, the Aussie admits he’d love the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a> job.</p>
      <p><i><b>MailSport</b> </i>, however, understands former St Mirren and Sunderland boss Ross is set to speak to the Hibs hierarchy on Tuesday and is still the top tip for the post, despite also being lined up for an interview with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a> over their vacancy.</p>

      <p>But at McDiarmid Park, Kewell said: “I’m sure I’m not the only one interested. It is a fantastic club with a fantastic set-up.</p>
      <p>“It would be a cracking job but I’m sure there are hundreds of managers who would like this opportunity.</p>
      <p>“But I’m 100 per cent looking to get back into management."</p>
