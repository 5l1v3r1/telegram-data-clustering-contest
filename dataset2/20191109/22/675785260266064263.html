      <h1>Brendan Rodgers dismisses Leicester title challenge despite Arsenal victory</h1>
      <h2>Jamie Vardy once again proved to be the scourge of the Gunners as he scored his ninth goal in as many appearances in this fixture before setting up James Maddison to seal a 2-0 victory</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T22:03:03+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 22:03</time> by <a rel="author">Simon Mullock, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/simon-mullock/</a></address>
      <p>Jamie Vardy continued his one-man crusade against Arsenal as Leicester announced themselves as title contenders.</p>
      <p>The former England striker grabbed his ninth goal in 10 games against the Gunners with a trademark finish.</p>
      <p>Vardy has carved a career out of finding space in crowded penalty areas - and then putting the ball in the net.</p>
      <p>When he was offered up the kind of chance he dreams about in only his sweetest of slumbers in the 67th minute, he wasn't found wanting.</p>
      <p>James Maddison made the points secure with a second <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> goal 15 minutes from the end.</p>
      <p>No wonder City boss Brendan Rodgers was dancing in the rain.</p>

      <p>His team moved above both <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> and sit just five points behind his pacesetting former club <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> at the top.</p>
      <p>Rodgers said: “I suppose we have thrown a hand grenade right into the middle of the top four.</p>
      <p>“But we're not thinking about the title race. We're thinking about developing a team and improving the players. That is our only focus.</p>
      <p>“Our job is to hope to be in the top four. I said when I came here that it would be great to play European football.</p>

      <p>“Huge credit goes to the players. They are playing with confidence and they are playing with steel.”</p>
      <p>Leicester now have 26 points from 12 games.</p>
      <p>That's a point more than they had collected at this stage four years ago – when they became the most unlikely English champions for 40 years.</p>
      <p>The King Power Stadium was rocking at the final whistle – while Arsenal's travelling supporters headed back to North London to dissect another performance bereft of any passion or plan.</p>
