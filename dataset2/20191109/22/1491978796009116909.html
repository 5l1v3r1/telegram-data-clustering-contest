      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/woodyallen">Woody Allen</a> and Amazon have ended their legal battle.</p>
      <p>The filmmaker <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/07/woody-allen-launches-68m-legal-action-against-amazon">sued Amazon for $68m in February</a> after the online giant ended his 2017 contract without ever releasing a completed film, A Rainy Day in New York.</p>
      <p>Amazon <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/04/amazon-claims-woody-allen-sabotaged-films-with-metoo-comments">responded</a> that Allen, whose daughter Dylan <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/17/soon-yi-previn-woody-allen-mia-dylan-ronan-farrow">has accused him of molesting her</a> when she was a girl, breached the four-movie deal by making <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/04/woody-allen-dylan-farrow-metoo-movement-poster-boy">insensitive</a> remarks <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/06/woody-allen-defends-me-too-movement-a-rainy-day-in-new-york">about the #MeToo movement</a>. Allen, 83, denies the allegations against him.</p>
      <p>In papers filed on Friday in US district court, Allen and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/amazon">Amazon</a> agreed that the case should be dismissed without prejudice. Terms were not disclosed.</p>
      <p>A Rainy Day in New York was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/07/woody-allen-movie-to-be-released-in-europe-amazon-studios">released overseas</a>, but not in the US.</p>
      <p>Allenâ€™s career has slowed in recent years, with actors who had appeared in his films, among them <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/18/colin-firth-woody-allen-accusations-film">Colin Firth</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/12/rebecca-hall-woody-allen-dylan-farrow">Rebecca Hall</a>, saying they would not work with him again.</p>
      <p>Others, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/04/scarlett-johansson-defends-woody-allen">including Scarlett Johansson</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/31/samantha-morton-no-regrets-at-working-with-woody-allen">Samantha Morton</a>, have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/02/anjelica-huston-defends-woody-allen-roman-polanski-sexual-abuse-metoo-movement">defended him</a>.</p>
