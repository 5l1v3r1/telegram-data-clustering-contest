      <h2>The goalkeeper had a quiet evening but spoke to the media after</h2>

      <p>Marc-Andre ter Stegen did not have to save Barca against Celta. He did speak after the game though.</p>
      <p>“A victory is always good,&amp;rdquor; mused the German goalkeeper.</p>
      <p>“At the start they made it hard for us because they pressed us one on one and it was hard to pass the ball to a player who had an opponent on his back. But in the end we got into the game and could get the goals.</p>
      <p>“We expected changes from Celta because they changed their coach and it’s never easy to play against a team fighting for survival and they are three important points for us.</p>
      <p>“We always are self-critical. That’s normal after any game, including a win like this. There are always things to improve. We’re players and we want to be professionals, to get to the top. Other teams want to beat us and we want to stay leaders in the league, the Champions League, wherever, and this is the way to do it.&amp;rdquor;</p>
