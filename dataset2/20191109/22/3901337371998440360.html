        <b>Absa Premiership</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Result:</b> AmaZulu 0-2 Chippa United</p>
      <p><b>Date</b>: 09 November 2019</p>
      <p><b>Venue:</b> Princess Magogo Stadium</p>
      <p>Chippa United finally registered their first Absa Premiership victory of the season with a 2-0 triumph over AmaZulu at the Princess Magogo Stadium on Saturday evening.</p>
      <p>Usuthu made two changes from their win over Stellenbosch FC, with Ovidy Karuru and Mbongeni Gumed returning to the fray, while the Chilli Boys had four alterations that included goalkeeper Veli Mothwa taking over from Patrick Tignyemb, as well as Thabo Rakhale and Mzikayise Mashaba.</p>
      <p>Jozef Vukusic's charges took the initiative to attack in the early stages, which nearly resulted in the opener in the 18th minute after Siyethemba Sithebe delivered a teasing cross into the box but Bonginkosi Ntuli's header was smothered by Mothwa.</p>
      <p>AmaZulu were playing a lot crosses in the area after that but they made it easy for Norman Mapeza's troops to defend, who were just absorbing the pressure and looking to go forward with long balls. However, the Chilli Boys were unable to trouble shot-stopper Siyabonga Mbatha for most of the half.</p>
      <p>Mapeza's troops were showing the willingness to go forward in numbers and they found the breakthrough on the hour-mark courtesy of William Twala's strike that took a deflection and wrong-footed Mbatha.</p>
      <p>Usuthu came close to finding the equaliser with 20 minutes remaining after Sithebe picked out Lehlohonolo Majoro inside the box, but the former Kaizer Chiefs striker guided his header over the bar.</p>
      <p>Vukusic' men were made to rue that miss as Twala got the second goal for Chippa five minutes before time with a neat finish past Mbatha.</p>
      <p>AmaZulu came close to pulling a goal back in the last three minutes after Majoro rattled the woodwork, but the Chilli Boys were able to hold on for their first win of the campaign.</p>
