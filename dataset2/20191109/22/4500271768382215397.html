      <p>The opening comes just days ahead of the Guru Nanak's 550th birthday on November 12.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of Indian Sikhs made a historic pilgrimage to Pakistan, crossing through a white gate to reach one of their religion's holiest sites, after a landmark opening of the Kartarpur corridor on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Cheering Sikhs walked joyfully along the road from Dera Baba Nanak in India towards the new immigration hall that would allow them to pass through a secure land corridor into Pakistan. Some fathers ran, carrying their children on their shoulders.</p>
      <p>Buses were waiting on the Pakistani side to carry them along the corridor to the shrine to Sikhism's founder Guru Nanak, which lies in Kartarpur, a small town just four kilometres (2.5 miles) inside Pakistan where he is believed to have died.</p>
      <p>“Generally people say that God is everywhere. But this walk feels like I'm going to directly seek blessings from Guru Nanak,” Surjit Singh Bajwa told <i>AFP</i> as he walked towards the corridor, crying as he spoke.</p>
      <p>Pilgrims on both sides of the border hoped the corridor might herald a thaw in South Asian tensions.</p>
      <p>Among the first pilgrims was former Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who told Pakistani state media that it was a “big moment”.</p>
      <p>Many believe it has happened now because of the friendship between Prime Minister Imran Khan, a World Cup winning cricketer-turned politician, and India's Navjot Singh Sidhu — another cricketer-turned-politician.</p>
      <p>Many were emotional, some in tears. Others posed for selfies before a giant gold-and silver-coloured kirpan, the dagger which Sikhs must carry with them at all times as an article of their faith.</p>
      <p>“Life is short,” said one of the Indian pilgrims, Davinder Singh Wadah. “Everyone has to go... so why not enjoy life and make this world a heaven, and I think this initiative is the beginning of it. “</p>
      <p>The opening comes just days ahead of the Guru Nanak's 550th birthday on November 12 — an anniversary of huge significance for the global Sikh community.</p>
