      <h1>Aston Villa star receives shock international call up ahead of Wolves clash</h1>
      <h2>The 22-year-old striker has been selected for Brazil duty</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T22:24:19+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 22:24</time> by <a rel="author">Ashley Preece, https://www.facebook.com/PreeceBirminghamLive/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> striker Wesley Moraes has been called up by Brazil for the first time, it has been announced.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old will replace crocked Ajax forward David Neres and will fly out to South America with Villa teammate Douglas Luiz - already named in Tite's squad - next week.</p>
      <p>Wesley arrived for £22m from Club Brugge in the summer, smashing Villa's transfer record.</p>
      <p>So far, in 11 Premier League games, he has scored four goals - including a well-taken brave at Norwich City in a game where he also missed a penalty.</p>

      <p>The forward will once again lead the line for Dean Smith against Wolves at Molinuex on Remembrance Sunday.</p>
      <p>He has been asked to lead the line alone during his first season in the Premier League with Villa short of back up options following injuries to Jonathan Kodjia and Keinan Davies.</p>
      <p>"I am very happy playing in the Premier League, in the biggest competition in the world," said Wesley when asked earlier this season about his move to Villa.</p>
      <p>"Every day, I think about the past - what I was thinking when teams were saying no to me - so I'm very happy now that I have this job."</p>
