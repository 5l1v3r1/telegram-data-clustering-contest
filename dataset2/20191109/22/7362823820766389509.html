      <p>The 21-year-old <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/georgia">Clark University Atlanta</a> <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education/college">student</a> whose body was found on Friday died of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/homicide">asphyxiation</a>, according to police.</p>
      <p>Alexis Crawford's body was found at a DeKalb County park some 11 miles from her off-campus apartment one week after she was reported missing. Two suspects -- her roommate and the roommate's boyfriend -- were arrested Saturday and are in police custody.</p>
      <p>Jordyn Jones and her boyfriend, Barron Brantley, both 21, are each charged with malice murder in Crawford's death. Both suspects were being held without bond at the Fulton County Jail.</p>

      <p>Alexandria Crawford told police she last heard from her sister Alexis on the night of Oct. 30. Alexis had texted Alexandria to ask: "What are you doing for the weekend?" Her sister responded, "Nothing."</p>
      <p>Crawford was last seen in public that same day at a store along Ralph David Abernathy Boulevard in southwest Atlanta. She was reported missing on Nov. 1.</p>
      <p>Jones told police she took her roommate to a liquor store on the night of Oct. 30. Police later released surveillance photos of Crawford inside the liquor store. Jones claimed she last saw her roommate at 12:30 a.m. and didn't see her in their apartment later that morning when she left for class.</p>
      <p>Crawford's phone, identification card and debit card were not found in the apartment, but her phone charger and keys were inside, according to a police report.</p>
