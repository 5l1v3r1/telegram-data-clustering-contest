      <p>The Queen has been hit by a mouse infestation at a Buckingham Palace pop up café.</p>
      <p>Health inspectors found rodent droppings at the Garden Café where visitors sip Earl Grey tea on a terrace overlooking Her Majesty’s lawns.</p>
      <p>Officials were urged to call in an extermination squad and teach kitchen workers pest control.</p>
      <p>Royal fans who pay up to £49 for admission to rooms at the Palace sit beneath a canopy to enjoy £7 cream teas of smoked salmon and scones.</p>
      <p>Also on the menu are bagels, cheesecake and posh pastries topped with a gold-dusted chocolate crown.</p>
      <p>Coffee comes in cups with a Royal logo with a crown-shaped dusting of cocoa powder.</p>

      <p>“It’s a huge treat – the closest most people can get to Her Majesty. So this is embarrassing,” said a source.</p>
      <p>Inspectors found mouse poo under a sink and near a dishwasher and said it needed “immediate and ongoing” attention.</p>
      <p>Sara Sutton, Westminster council’s director of public protection, said of one location: “I was informed this area was not easy to clean as staff were unable to mop due to a large electrical generator stored here.</p>

      <p>“I believe there should be bespoke pest control procedures for the premises taking into account the limitations.</p>
      <p>I would encourage you to continue to work with your pest-control contractor to ensure the premises remain pest-free.”</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the café said they had now “adhered to the guidelines in the report to reduce and control the risk of pests”.</p>
