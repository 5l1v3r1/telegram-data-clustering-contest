      <p>When Scott Aspinall started asking people in Regina struggling with homelessness about their stories three years ago, he came face-to-face with an array of stereotypes people in poverty face on a daily basis.</p>
      <p>As co-founder of MayBell Developments — a Regina non-profit that seeks to empower those in poverty — with his wife Tori, Aspinall often saw the negative impact these stereotypes had. The couple decided they wanted to understand the individual people behind the labels.</p>
      <p>“Just walking around downtown you see people panhandling and generally kind of down on their luck, so we thought it would be cool to just sit and talk with them and hear their stories,” he said.</p>
      <p>“The longer we did that, the more we just began to understand that … they’re not all criminals, they’re not all drug addicts.”</p>
      <p>Aspinall quickly realized there was very little difference between him and those in poverty. In fact, one woman he spoke to had a story identical to his own in many ways.</p>
      <p>“Our stories were so eerily similar. It really hit that home, like we had the same university degree and we’d worked in the same kind of field but you know, she’s in the street and I live in a nice house with a beautiful family,” he said.</p>
      <p>“They’re humans and they have their own struggle, but they also have abilities and hopes and dreams just like us.”</p>

      <p>Wanting other people to come to the same realization, Aspinall — who is also a photographer — decided to take photographs of the people he talked to and, if they were willing, post them on social media along with some of their life story.</p>
      <p>Then a year ago, Aspinall had the idea to print some of the photos and hang them in a gallery. Through a partnership with <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/carmichael-outreach-calling-for-winter-clothing-donations-as-temperatures-drop">Carmichael Outreach</a> and <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/the-junction-building-a-community-to-embrace-the-weird">The Junction Creative Studio</a>, the idea began to take shape.</p>
      <p>The gallery, titled YQR Stories, opens Saturday evening at 6 p.m. at the Woods Art Space in The Junction. It features four of the portraits Aspinall took accompanied by a transcript of the conversation he had with each person.</p>
      <p>Aspinall is thrilled to see the project finally come to fruition, and he hopes people will take the time to read the stories and think through the stereotypes they might have about people in poverty.</p>
      <p>“Just the idea that this person that’s across a socio-economic line from me is not so different than me, and maybe I can engage in a conversation with them to understand them more, to maybe even just say hi on the street,” he said.</p>
      <p>Rochelle Berenyi, communications, advocacy and projects officer at Carmichael Outreach, said when Aspinall mentioned the idea of a gallery that could also double as a fundraiser for the organization, she thought it was a great idea.</p>
      <p>“It’s so important to share people’s stories because it’s so easy for people to just create this idea in their head of what poverty looks like,” she said.</p>
      <p>“When that happens, there comes a lot of assumptions and judgments and you kind of start to see a lot of times people being dehumanized.”</p>
      <p>The gallery will be open until Nov. 30 at the Woods Art Space in The Junction located at 2347 McIntyre Street. Admission is free, but donations will be accepted for Carmichael Outreach.</p>
