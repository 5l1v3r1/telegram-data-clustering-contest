      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Shadow Health Secretary Jon Ashworth reveals Labour’s manifesto pledge to reinstate NHS student bursaries worth £20,000 a year in maintenance and support, recruiting 24,000 nurses</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T22:36:23+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 22:36</time> by <a rel="author">Nigel Nelson, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/nigel-nelson/</a></address>
      <p>Labour will recruit 24,000 extra nurses if Jeremy Corbyn becomes PM – while the Tories will fall 10,000 short if <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> stays in power.</p>
      <p>Shadow Health Secretary Jon Ashworth revealed Labour’s manifesto pledge to reinstate NHS student bursaries worth £20,000 a year in maintenance and support.</p>
      <p>Their scrapping by the Tories three years ago has contributed to 40,000 unfilled nursing posts.</p>
      <p>And as demands on the NHS grow that will increase by another 10,000 over the next five years.</p>
      <p>Now in an exclusive interview Mr Ashworth promises: “I will be the nurses’ champion because I know how valuable they are.</p>
      <p>“And every patient knows they go the extra mile day in day out. Our NHS is built on its staff, in particular nurses and midwives.”</p>

      <p>Bringing back bursaries will cost £1billion a year and Mr Ashworth will work to increase the numbers specialising in mental health and disability as well as health visitors and community district nurses.</p>
      <p>He added: “All these areas have seen cutbacks under the Tories and I want to reverse that.”</p>
      <p>He will also abandon Boris Johnson’s new plan to charge nurses from abroad £400 in visa costs.</p>
      <p>If we stayed in the EU those from Europe would not have to pay anything at all. And under Labour, nor will they if we leave.</p>

      <p>Mr Ashworth said: “Rather than introduce this recruitment tax we will allow hospitals to recruit both internationally and ethically without them having to pay a penny.”</p>
      <p>The Royal College of Nursing warned former PM <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/theresa-may">Theresa May</a> her long-term health plan would not work unless an extra £1billion was invested in nurse training.</p>
      <p>The number of people applying to study nursing in England has fallen by more than 13,000 since 2016.</p>
      <p>The RCN’s Dame Donna Kinnair said: “Failure to act now risks patient care for a generation.</p>
      <p>“With applicant numbers showing no sign of recovering since the removal of student funding, health care services will ultimately have even fewer nurses to treat us in our hospitals, homes, schools and clinics.”</p>
      <p>The shortage is even more acute in the over-25s. Applications have fallen by 41 per cent since bursaries ended.</p>
      <p>Should Labour win the election and Mr Ashworth replace Matt Hancock on December 13 he will have a lot on his plate.</p>

      <p>Hospital waiting lists are at an all-time high of 4.4 million and on Mr Hancock’s watch 18-week waits for treatment have soared more than 150,000, from 504,000 to 662,000.</p>
      <p>When critics say Labour cannot improve on that, Mr Ashworth points to the last Labour government when waiting lists were at their lowest and patient satisfaction at its highest.</p>
      <p>He added: “There has to be a greater emphasis on keeping people healthy. We do that by tackling obesity, improving mental health support and the health of children.</p>
      <p>“Delivering care is about working as a team with doctors, nurses, midwives, porters and cleaners.</p>
      <p>“There are 34,000 cancer patients waiting longer than two months for treatment. Young people are self-harming and suicidal because they cannot get mental health support.</p>
      <p>“And it’s shameful and heartbreaking when elderly people are languishing on trolleys in corridors.</p>

      <p>“I’m passionate about the NHS and I’ll fight for it as if our lives depended on it – which of course they do.”</p>
      <p>Mr Ashworth is backing the Sunday Mirror campaign to boost the number of trainee GPs to at least 5,000 a year.</p>
      <p>The Tories have only committed to an extra 500, which means Labour making 1,500 more available.</p>
      <p>Mr Ashworth said: “I’ve already announced plans to expand GP training places to 5,000 a year.</p>
      <p>“The truth is no one will believe Matt Hancock. The Tories promised 5,000 extra GPs and then cut their number by 1,600.”</p>
