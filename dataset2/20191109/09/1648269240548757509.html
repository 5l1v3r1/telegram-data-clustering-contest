      <h1>7-Seat Chevy Blazer, Menlo Electric Sedan Debut In China</h1>
      <h2>Will we get this seven-seat version in the U.S.?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T09:30:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 09:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.motor1.com/info/team/jacob-oliva/" target="_blank">Jacob Oliva</a></address>
      <p>It's not a secret that the global automotive market has an insatiable hunger for crossovers and SUVs. <a href="https://www.motor1.com/chevrolet/">Chevrolet</a> has done a great job in feeding that frenzy, giving the American buyers the Traverse and Suburban for those looking for seven seats. The <a href="https://www.motor1.com/chevrolet/blazer/">Blazer</a>, on the other hand, offers a five-seat capacity in a hefty and admittedly great-looking package. </p>
      <p>In China, however, Chevrolet gave the Blazer an extra row for a seven-seat capacity. It's endemic to the country and it has a longer rear (almost 5 meters or 16 feet in overall length. The seven-seat Chevy Blazer was launched in the People's Republic alongside the new Menlo electric sedan – also exclusive to the Chinese market at this time.</p>

      <p>Chevrolet Menlo Electric "Sedan"</p>
      <p>The Chevy Menlo electric sedan is the Golden Bowtie's first fully-electric vehicle in China. While it carries the sedan name (the press release says so), it looks like a low-riding crossover. Well, to us, at least. Chevrolet China didn't provide additional images of the Menlo. But if it's any indication, the Menlo inherits the styling of the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/142963/chevy-fnr-x-concept-shanghai/">FNR-X Concept crossover</a> that debuted in Shanghai two years ago. </p>
      <p>The Chevy Menlo boasts a 255-mile (410-kilometer) range under New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) conditions. It also carries the latest generation of Chevy's MyLink infotainment system, along with "class-leading battery technology and highly efficient electric propulsion and intelligent connectivity technologies to offer a new green driving experience."</p>

      <p>Going back to the Chinese Blazer, it looks like the seven-seat Blazer will be exclusive to the Chinese market as several reports suggest. However, several spy shots of a larger Blazer has surfaced all year round, which gave birth to the speculation that the U.S. market will probably get the bigger crossover soon.</p>
      <p>However, Chevy hasn't confirmed such speculations just yet, so we should all take those spy shots with a little bit of skepticism for now.</p>
