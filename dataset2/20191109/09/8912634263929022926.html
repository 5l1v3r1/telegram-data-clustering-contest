      <p>OAXACA, Mexico: At least five police officers were killed after they were ambushed in a small community nestled in the highlands of the state of Oaxaca in southern Mexico, local authorities reported.<br/>The policemen were attacked late on Friday afternoon, according to the Secretary of State Security, as they patrolled La Cementera de San Vicente Coatlan, a community of about 4,000 inhabitants, roughly 80 kilometers from the state capital.<br/>Five officers were killed and two more were injured, the ministry said in a statement. The two injured men were taken to a hospital in Oaxaca.<br/>“I condemn the aggression against elements of the State Police in San Vicente Coatlan and I sympathize with their relatives. I have asked the prosecutor for an exhaustive investigation,” Oaxaca Governor Alejandro Murat wrote on his Twitter account.<br/>The violent events in Oaxaca, the majority linked to organized crime, have multiplied in recent years. Last August, the mayor of San Jose Estancia Grande and a state official were killed in an armed attack.<br/>The army was dispatched to fight drug trafficking in 2006, but experts blame the so-called “drug war” for the spiraling violence between fragmented cartels and the military, which has led to more than 250,000 murders.</p>
