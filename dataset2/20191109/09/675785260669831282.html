      <h1>Jermaine Jenas brands Arsenal's season "disastrous" and makes top four prediction</h1>
      <h2>The former Tottenham midfielder has forecast who he believes will qualify for next season's Champions League</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T09:00:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jermaine-jenas">Jermaine Jenas</a> has laid into <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal's</a> start to the season and believes neither they nor former club <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> will make the top four.</p>
      <p>The Gunners are sat just outside the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/champions-league">Champions League</a> qualification spots despite winning just one of their last five matches.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> and Man City lead the race as they look set to battle it out for the Premier League title, while <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> occupy the other two spots.</p>
      <p>Asked who he thought would secure a top four place, Jenas said: "Originally I was <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Spurs</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> [along with Liverpool and Man City].</p>
      <p>"But I think Arsenal’s season has been disastrous. Although they’re much higher in the table than Spurs, it’s just been more mayhem at that football club.</p>

      <p>"And even the manager now seems to be under a lot of pressure, so I don’t think they’ll make it.</p>
      <p>"I’ll replace them with Chelsea, because I think what Frank’s [Lampard] got going there is solid. The players are top drawer."</p>
      <p>Tottenham meanwhile are languishing in mid-table, and face a battle to address their slump and catch their rivals.</p>

      <p>They've picked up just three wins out of a possible 11 matches so far this season as problems behind the scenes continue.</p>
      <p>Quizzed on whether he thought his old club would miss out, Jenas said: "I do. I never thought they would, but I thought they’d have picked up more results by now.</p>
      <p>"When I look at them, they're not a team that’s going to make top four. They’re not playing that way.</p>

      <p>"I think in that fourth spot, it’s going to be tough to shake Leicester now. With the free weeks that they have, only the cups to come into it.</p>
      <p>"They are a team that can be shaken don’t get me wrong, all it takes is a [Jamie] Vardy or [Jonny] Evans injury, they haven’t got that much depth, and it won’t take much to knock them off track.</p>
      <p>"But I think that lead they’ve developed, they might be able to hold onto it."</p>
