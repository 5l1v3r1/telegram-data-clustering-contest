      <h1>Bakkt Bitcoin Futures Daily Trading Volume Hits New Record — $15M</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T09:06:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 09:06</time> by <a rel="author">Adrian Zmudzinski</a></address>
      <p>Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) futures daily volumes on digital asset platform <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bakkt">Bakkt</a> have hit a new all-time high, with 1,741 futures traded on Nov. 9.</p>
      <p>Bakkt <a href="https://twitter.com/Bakkt/status/1192940915033329664">announced</a> the new record, stating: </p>
      <blockquote>“Today we set a new daily record of 1,756 Bakkt Bitcoin Futures contracts traded.”</blockquote>
      <h3>Volume spike coincides with Bitcoin price dip</h3>
      <p>Twitter account dedicated to Bakkt futures trading volume data, Bakkt Volume Bot, also <a href="https://twitter.com/BakktBot/status/1193063074179305473">pointed out</a> the development on Nov. 8. </p>
      <p>Additionally, the daily volume of 1,741 (about $15.5 million) represents a 109% increase over the 834 contracts traded the day before with each contract being equivalent to one Bitcoin.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The new record volume coincides with a sharp Bitcoin price <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-drops-300-daily-losses-among-altcoins-reach-10">decrease,</a> falling under $9,000. The last reported Bakkt contract trading price as of press time is $8,895.</p>
      <h3>Bakkt’s volume rising month over month</h3>
      <p>Bakkt physically settled monthly Bitcoin trading volumes have been steadily rising since its launch. In October, its volumes have hit a new all-time high with <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bakkt-hits-new-all-time-high-with-over-450-bitcoin-futures-contracts-traded">452 contracts traded</a>. </p>
      <p>Notably, on Oct. 26, Bakkt traded 1,183 Bitcoin futures contracts after <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bakkts-bitcoin-futures-volume-explodes-260-to-trade-11m-in-24-hours">registering a staggering 257% volume increase</a> in 24 hours. This also coincided with a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-soars-42-to-10-500-biggest-daily-gain-since-2011">major price move</a> that sent BTC over $10,000.</p>
      <p>As Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bakkt-set-to-smash-bitcoin-trading-volume-record-in-november">reported</a> earlier this week, Bakkt is also on its way to set a new monthly trading volume record. The company is also <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/breaking-bakkt-announces-first-regulated-options-contract-for-bitcoin">expected</a> to launch the first regulated Bitcoin options contract on Dec. 9.</p>
