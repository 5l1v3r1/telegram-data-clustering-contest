      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T09:00:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author">Hamilton Advertiser, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/hamilton-advertiser/</a></address>
      <p>A £130,000 package of major road improvement works has been completed on one of Hamilton’s busiest stretches.</p>
      <p>Cadzow Street, which can see traffic flows of almost two million vehicles a year, has benefitted from: More than 5000 square metres of carriageway resurfacing; additional deep patching; complete relining and anti-skid surfacing from Leechlee Road to Muir Street.</p>
      <p>The road, part of Hamilton conservation area , was closed entirely to allow roads to work around the clock and ensure the work was finished during the recent October school holiday.</p>
      <p>Councillor John Anderson, chair of South Lanarkshire’s Community and Enterprise Resources Committee, praised the team for the speed and efficiency of the project.</p>
      <p>He added: “Our roads investment programme is now a decade in, and has allowed us the opportunity to carry out significant works such as this across South Lanarkshire.</p>
      <p>“Road closures inevitably cause disruption, and we work very hard to keep that to a minimum. However, in the long term, the benefits of undertaking these large-scale projects far outweigh the short term disadvantage.</p>
      <p>“We are, of course, grateful to residents, businesses and motorists for their co-operation and patience during such a large-scale project. I really believe it has paid off.”</p>
      <p>South Lanarkshire Council committed to its multi-million pound roads investment programme in 2008, and since then has boosted its roads budget by an additional £137m.</p>
