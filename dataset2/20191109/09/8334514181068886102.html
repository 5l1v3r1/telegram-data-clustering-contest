      <p>The Huskies (1-0) trailed for more than 35 minutes in the Armed Forces Classic, falling behind by as many as 13 points in the second half. Stewart’s baby-hook shot in the lane with 30 seconds remaining gave Washington a two-point lead, its first advantage since 5-3 three minutes into the contest.</p>
      <p>Stewart finished with 15 points and seven rebounds in his collegiate debut, and keyed Washington’s zone defense with his performance on the interior. Baylor forwards Freddie Gillespie and Tristan Clark were held to a combined 7-of-25 shooting from the floor for the Bears (1-1).</p>
      <p>The Huskies’ zone defense also helped generate 17 Baylor turnovers, but sloppy play on the other end of the floor resulted in 20 Washington turnovers.</p>
      <p>No. 2 Kentucky 91, Eastern Kentucky 49</p>
      <p>Fresh off its victory over No. 1 Michigan State in the Champions Classic in New York, the Wildcats stayed perfect by blowing out the visiting Colonels in Lexington.</p>
      <p>Kentucky (2-0) raced out to a 14-0 lead with 13:42 to go in the first half and never looked back, leading by as many as 44 points. Junior forward Nick Richards paced Kentucky with 21 points and 10 rebounds. He was one of six players in double figures. Immanuel Quickley had 16 points, and Nate Sestina added 12 points and 11 rebounds.</p>
      <p>Kentucky made 54.8 percent of its shots, despite going 2-of-14 from 3-point range. The Wildcats were 32-of-48 from inside the arc, and they dominated the boards, 54-25. Eastern Kentucky (1-1) got 14 points from Michael Moreno.</p>
      <p>No. 3 Kansas 74, UNC Greensboro 62</p>
      <p>Sophomore point guard Devon Dotson posted 22 points, eight rebounds and six assists as the Jayhawks overcame a sluggish start to upend the Spartans at Lawrence, Kan.</p>
      <p>Senior center Udoka Azubuike added 10 points and 10 rebounds after missing all but nine games last season with an injured wrist. Iowa transfer Isaiah Moss, who sat out the season opener with a strained hamstring, made his debut for Kansas (1-1) and added eight points.</p>
      <p>Junior guard Isaiah Miller, the preseason Southern Conference player of the year, led the Spartans (1-1) with 19 points but scored just two in the second half. Sophomore guard Kaleb Hunter added 17.</p>
      <p>No. 4 Duke 89, Colorado State 55</p>
      <p>Cassius Stanley, a freshman making his home debut, scored 19 points and Tre Jones poured in 15 as the Blue Devils drubbed the Rams in Durham, N.C.</p>
      <p>Alex O’Connell tacked on 14 points and freshmen Vernon Carey Jr. and Wendell Moore Jr. provided 11 and 10 points, respectively, for Duke (2-0). Jones scored 11 of his points in the first half and ended up with a game-high eight assists.</p>
      <p>Isaiah Stevens and David Roddy led Colorado State with 12 points apiece. Nico Carvacho added 11 points for the Rams (1-1).</p>
      <p>No. 9 North Carolina 78, UNC Wilmington 62</p>
      <p>Cole Anthony had 20 points and 10 rebounds, and Justin Pierce added 18 points and 12 boards as the Tar Heels (2-0) topped the Seahawks (1-0) in Wilmington, N.C.</p>
      <p>Anthony, a freshman coming off a 34-point outburst Tuesday in the Tar Heels’ win over Notre Dame, struggled from the floor, making only 7 of 24 shots. Pierce, a graduate transfer from William &amp; Mary, went over 1,000 career points and posted the 17th double-double of his career.</p>
      <p>Shykeim Phillips and Jaylen Sims led the UNC Wilmington with 12 points each, and Sims pulled down 12 rebounds. Marten Linssen added 10 points.</p>
      <p>No. 14 Memphis 92, Illinois-Chicago 46</p>
      <p>Less than an hour after he was cleared to play by a court order amid a dispute over his eligibility, James Wiseman scored 17 points as the Tigers routed the Flames.</p>
      <p>Wiseman, considered a potential No. 1 pick in the 2020 NBA Draft, made all four of his field goal attempts and added nine rebounds with five blocks in 25 minutes. The 7-foot-1 preseason All-American had 28 points, 11 rebounds and three blocks in Memphis’ season-opening win over South Carolina State on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The eligibility drama pushed to the background a game that on paper was expected to be a blowout and lived up to that projection. Memphis (2-0) led 47-16 at halftime thanks to 11 three-pointers, six by freshman guard Boogie Ellis, while the Tigers held UIC (1-1) to 20 percent shooting before the break and 24.2 percent for the game.</p>
      <p>No. 17 Utah State 89, Weber State 34</p>
      <p>Justin Bean had a career-high 18 points to go with nine rebounds and Sam Merrill had 14 points, six rebounds and six assists as the host Aggies closed the first half on a 44-7 run to rout their undermanned in-state rival Wildcats in Logan, Utah.</p>
      <p>Abel Porter had 10 points and 10 assists, Diogo Brito had 12 points and Brock Miller added 11 for the Aggies, who broke a two-game losing streak in the series that matches schools that are 48 miles apart.</p>
      <p>The Wildcats played without guard Jerrick Harding, a two-time All-Big Sky selection and the preseason league MVP this year. He suffered a right ankle injury in the preseason. Donatas Kupsas had 10 points to lead Weber State, which shot 21.7 percent from the field, while the Aggies shot 55.2 percent from the field.</p>
      <p>No. 19 Xavier 81, Siena 63</p>
      <p>Naji Marshall had 20 points, eight rebounds and seven assists and Tyrique Jones added 20 points as the host Musketeers pulled away from the Saints in Cincinnati.</p>
      <p>Jason Carter, playing in place of star guard Paul Scruggs, had nine points, Bryce Moore had eight points and Quentin Goodin had seven points and three assists for the Musketeers, who took control with a 25-4 run in the second half.</p>
      <p>Elijah Burns had 19 points and two 3-pointers, Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference preseason player of the year Jalen Pickett had 18 points and five rebounds and Don Carey had 11 points for the Saints, who have split their first two games.</p>
      <p>No. 22 LSU 88, Bowling Green 79</p>
      <p>Javonte Smart scored 21 points and the Tigers opened their season by pulling away from the Falcons in Baton Rouge, La.</p>
      <p>Smart, stepping into the point guard position vacated when All-SEC player Tremont Waters left early for the NBA after last season, added eight rebounds and five assists. Emmitt Williams came off the bench and added 21 points, and Skylar Mays chipped in with 18.</p>
      <p>Justin Turner scored 26, Caleb Fields added 17 and Dylan Frye had 15 for the Falcons, who shot just 32.0 percent from the floor.</p>
      <p>No. 24 Auburn, 76, Davidson 66</p>
      <p>Isaac Okoro scored 17 points and Danjel Purifoy added 14 as the Tigers held off the Wildcats in the opening game of the Veterans Classic at Annapolis, Md.</p>
      <p>The Tigers (2-0) led the entire game but never could get comfortable against the Wildcats (0-1), who got 18 points from guard Luke Frampton but only seven from preseason Atlantic 10 Player of the Year Jon Axel Gudmundsson.</p>
      <p>After leading by just two at the break, the Tigers scored the first seven points of the second half and were up by 13 points, 49-36, just over five minutes into the period.</p>
      <p>No. 25 VCU 59, North Texas 56</p>
      <p>Marcus Evans scored 13 points and made a key steal in the final seconds as the Rams withstood the Mean Green’s second-half rally in Richmond, Va.</p>
      <p>VCU led 57-56 when Evans missed two free throws with 38 seconds remaining. The Mean Green lost their chance to take the lead when Evans stole Umoja Gibson’s bounce pass in the lane. De’Riante Jenkins was fouled and sank two foul shots with 10 seconds left. North Texas (1-1) failed to get off a good shot as time expired.</p>
      <p>Jenkins added 12 points and Mike’L Simms (eight points) sank two key 3-pointers in the final 2:10 for the Rams (2-0). DJ Draper scored 12 points on four 3-pointers for North Texas, which was seeking its first win over a ranked opponent in 48 years.</p>
