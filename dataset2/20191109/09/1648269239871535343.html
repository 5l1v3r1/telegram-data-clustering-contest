      <h2>Does a modernized 928 look better than the original?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T09:46:34+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 09:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.motor1.com/info/team/chris%20okula/" target="_blank">Chris Okula</a></address>
      <p>When the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/porsche/">Porsche 928</a> debuted in 1977 the futuristic grand tourer was set to usher in a new age for Porsche with the goal of replacing the aging <a href="https://www.motor1.com/porsche/911/">911</a>. Fortunately, the 928 was able to coexist with the 911 thanks to its radically different water-cooled front-engine V8 layout. Porsche ended 928 production in 1995 leaving us to wonder, what would a modern 928 look like?</p>
      <p>Luckily photoshop master TheSketchMoneky is hard at work in his latest video creating a modern rendition of the Porsche 928. The V8 powered 928 was a very polarizing design when it debuted but can a modern rendition broaden its appeal? </p>

      <p>In 1977 a pre-production 928 set the record for the fastest naturally aspirated production car. At the Bonneville salt flats, IMSA racer Al Holbert took a pre-production 928 S4 to a top speed of 171 mph. The 928’s powerful V8 and aerodynamic design made it the perfect autobahn cruiser and capable of this impressive top speed.  </p>
      <p>The 1977 928 featured a 4.5-liter V8 which produced 219 horsepower and 268 lb-ft of torque. As time went on, displacement rose and electronic fuel injection was introduced to provide more power. By 1985 a 5.0-liter V8 was standard in the American 928 and power rose to 288 horsepower to compete with more powerful American competition. Most 928’s were sold with a Mercedes derived automatic transmission although a dogleg 5-speed manual transmission was available.  </p>

      <p>The crown jewel of the 928 came in 1993 with the debut of the Porsche 928 GTS. This top-level trim used a 5.4-liter V8 resulting in 345 horsepower and could sprint from 0-60 in under 6 seconds. This rare trim level marked the end of the 928’s production run with only 406 examples reaching American dealerships. </p>
