      <p>A University of North <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/texas">Texas</a> attorney resigned Friday less than 24 hours after she used a racial slur while giving examples of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-signs-executive-order-to-promote-free-speech-on-college-campuses">free speech</a> at an event called “When Hate Comes to Campus.”</p>
      <p>Assistant general counsel Caitlin Sewell was speaking in a panel discussion Thursday when she used the N-word word, FOX 4 of Dallas reported.</p>
      <p>“You know, you can say a lot of offensive things in here because it’s impossible to talk about the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/personal-freedoms/first-amendment">First Amendment</a> without saying horrible things," she said in front of an audience. "Um, you know, ‘You’re just a dumb n----- and I hate you.’ That alone, that’s protected speech.”</p>

      <p>Several members of the audience became outraged, questioning Sewell about why she would choose to say the N-word but then later censor herself instead of using the F-word.</p>

      <p>Sewell apologized immediately and said she didn’t mean to offend anyone.</p>
      <p>“I understand what she’s trying to say, in that we have the right to say anything in this country, however, she explicitly decided to censor the F-word, and after that happened, it made me feel as though she just negated my entire identity,” UNT Student Government Association President Yolian Ogbu said, according to FOX 4.</p>

      <p>Ogbu and Cameron Combs, president of UNT’s Black Student Union, called for Sewell’s resignation and by Friday morning she had resigned.</p>
      <p>“We strongly believe in a culture that embraces, and vehemently defends inclusion. While Ms. Sewell was trying to make a point about First Amendment speech, the references used are never condoned in our community, which prides itself in our diversity and caring nature,” the president wrote in the statement.</p>
