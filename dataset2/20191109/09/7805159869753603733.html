      <p>Transferring data from one smartphone to another shouldn’t be a difficult task. However, when you’re moving your personal files from an iPhone to and Android, it can get a little tricky. Many transfer methods require you to connect both devices to a computer to properly transfer all of your important files. The most convenient way to go about this would be to have an app that can transfer everything wirelessly without any need for a PC. This is where MobileTrans comes in. MobileTrans is a powerful <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wondershare.mobiletranstoandroid">iOS to Android transfer app</a> that makes the process effortless. Completing a transfer manually can be slow and sometimes very difficult for certain type of files. MobileTrans will help you grab all of your files and get you setup on a new device.</p>

There are two ways for you to do this. The first way is by connecting the app to your iCloud account and pulling your backed up data from there. The second way is to use a USB cable for a direct tether from one phone to the other. Most file types are supported with up to 13 different types that are compatible with the iOS to Android transfer.</p>
