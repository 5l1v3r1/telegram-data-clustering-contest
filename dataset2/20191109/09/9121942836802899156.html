      <p>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — The University of Alaska Board of Regents approved a $277 million operating budget request Friday following a plan previously negotiated by university leaders and Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy.</p>
      <p>Officials say the decrease is part of a three-year plan to reduce the budget by $25 million in the 2019-20 school year, an additional $25 million the following year and a $20 million cut the third year.</p>
      <p>Officials say the budget cut must still be approved by the Alaska Legislature.</p>
      <p>Board regents say they originally planned to vote on a proposed 5% tuition increase for the coming fall semester but unanimously agreed to postpone the vote until January after student opposition.</p>
      <p>The next full board meeting is scheduled for Jan. 17 in Anchorage.</p>
