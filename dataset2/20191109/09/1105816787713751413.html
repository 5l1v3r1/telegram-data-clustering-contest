      <p><i><b>DUBAI: </b>Coke Studio</i> released the third episode of Season 12, featuring<i> Chal Raha Hoon</i> by Umair Jaswal, <i>Mubarik Mubarik</i> by Banur’s Band and Atif Aslam, and <i>Aadam</i> by Fareed Ayaz and Abu Muhammad with Humnawa, on November 8, 2019.</p>
      <p>The third episode is clearly the best so far from the season that is being produced by Rohail Hyatt. The three tracks released in this episode are unique and catchy in their own fashion.</p>
