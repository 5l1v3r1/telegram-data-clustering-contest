      <h3>Says Malasakit Centers soon to be institutionalized to serve Filipinos in need of medical assistance.</h3>
      <p>STRAIGHT from the groundbreaking ceremony for the housing construction project for  victims of Typhoon Yolanda in Tanauan, Leyte and from the candle lighting ceremony commemorating the tragedy, Senator Christopher Lawrence “Bong” went immediately to Tacloban City on Friday to assist victims who lost their homes in a fire recently.</p>
      <p>Go brought groceries, food packs and financial assistance, and distributed them to the 49 families affected by the fire  that occurred in Brgy. 37 of Seawall Area in Tacloban City on November 2.</p>
      <p>“Pangako ko noon na papasukin ko at pupuntahan ang bawat iskinita at sulok ng bansa hanggang sa makakaya ko para malaman ko ang inyong hinaing at makapagpadala ng tulong sa mga nangangailangan,” Go told the fire victims.</p>
      <p>The senator told the crowd that he will help provide uniforms and school supplies for students who were affected by the fire.</p>
      <p>Representatives from the different government agencies were  present to provide additional assistance to the fire victims. The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) representatives offered livelihood assistance while the National Housing Authority (NHA) extended housing assistance to the qualified victims.</p>
      <p>Go encouraged those who need medical assistance to go to the nearest Malasakit Center to seek government aid. While another Malasakit Center is set to be established in Leyte, Go encouraged the residents to utilize the first one built at Eastern Visayas Medical Center where they can avail of medical assistance from government agencies such as the  Department of Health (DOH), Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO) and PhilHealth.</p>
      <p>“Sa mga nasaktan sa sunog o maysakit, pumunta po kayo sa pinakamalapit na Malasakit Center dito sa Tacloban. Makakatulong po ang Malasakit Center sa inyo dahil hindi kayo pababayaan sa pag-assist na makakuha ng financial medical assistance,” Go said.</p>
      <p>“Walang pinipili dito... Basta Pilipino ka, pwede kang humingi ng tulong dito,” he added.</p>
      <p>Go said that the Malasakit Center Act of 2019 is nearing approval in the Senate and will hopefully become a law soon to  serve more Filipinos in need of medical assistance.</p>
      <p>“Sa ngayon, pumasa na po sa second reading (sa Senado). And hopefully po sa Kongreso with the help of the majority floor leader, maipasa na rin (sa Lower House),” Go explained, referring to the support committed by House Majority Floor Leader and Tacloban City representative Martin Romualdez who was present to provide assistance to his fellow Taclobanons.  </p>
      <p>Go said that he seeks to institutionalize and set criteria for the establishment of Malasakit Centers to ensure that the centers are properly staffed so that concerned agencies are represented and are functioning properly to help every Filipino in need of medical assistance.  </p>
      <p>“Gusto natin magkaroon ng criteria para sundin. Gusto nating kumpleto yung serbisyo. Isang one-stop shop po itong Malasakit Center para di na sila kailangan pumunta pa sa iba’t ibang opisina ng gobyerno para lang humingi ng tulong mula sa perang kanila naman po talaga,” Go said.</p>
      <p>Based on the current version of the proposed measure, Go is pushing for the establishment of more Malasakit Centers, prioritizing first all 73 DoH-run hospitals nationwide. “Unahin muna ito. And yung mga LGUs naman, may criteria, dapat sila may bahay, may kwarto para dun sa apat na ahensya,” the senator emphasized. </p>
