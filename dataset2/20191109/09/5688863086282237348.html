      <h1>AUS vs PAK | Good scheduling has allowed Australia to focus on T20, feels Justin Langer</h1>

        <b>Head coach Justin Langer has admitted that it was the schedule put up with a specific focus on T20s that has helped the Aussies regain their mojo in the shortest format of the game. A dominant 10-wicket victory over Pakistan on Friday ensured that Australia will finish the year unbeaten in T20Is.</b>
      </p>
      <p>As the man who led the Perth Scorchers to three Big Bash titles before taking on the head coach’s cap with the national team, Langer has been in charge of Australia’s resurrection in T20 cricket. Skipper <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/aaron_finch">Aaron Finch</a> and Co. have now won eight straight T20 internationals — their best winning streak since 2010 — including the 3-0 clean sweep of Sri Lanka last month. </p>
      <p>“The schedule this year allows us to do it as well. In the past, it’s been very difficult to manage players through playing all forms of the game. We understand the value of focusing on something, whether it’s short-term or long-term, and we’ll continue to do that,” Langer said, reported Fox Sports. </p>
      <p>From the group stage exit in 2016 till about 12 months ago, the Aussies, by Langer’s own admission, were the worst T20 team in the world. </p>
      <p>“We’ve just gotta make sure the boys play their roles really well. Twelve months is a long way away. This time twelve months ago, we were the worst team in the world. But it’s really good we’re playing good cricket. We’ve learned a lot about planning and preparation. We’ve learned the value of that through the World Cup 50-over competition. The more we can keep these guys together, the better,” Langer added.</p>
      <p>The 48-year-old is keen to stick to Australia’s formula of playing five specialist bowlers and six batsmen against their next T20 assignment — the South Africans — in February.</p>
