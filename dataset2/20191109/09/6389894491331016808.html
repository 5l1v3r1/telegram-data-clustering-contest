      <p>The three major US stock indexes posted record closing highs and the S&amp;P 500 registered a fifth straight week of gains on Friday despite comments from Donald Trump insisting he had not agreed to roll back tariffs on Chinese goods.</p>
      <p>Officials from both China and the United States agreed to end some tariffs on each others’ goods in a “phase one” trade deal on Thursday.</p>

      <p>But Trump later denied he had agreed anything, sparking concern a trade deal was not near.</p>
      <p>“China would like to get somewhat of a rollback, not a complete rollback, ‘cause they know I won’t do it,” Trump said. “I haven’t agreed to anything.” </p>
      <p>He said China wanted to make a deal more than he did and added that the tariffs were generating “billions” for US coffers.</p>
      <p>“I’m very happy right now. We’re taking in billions of dollars,” he said.</p>
      <p>Having initially pushed stocks a little lower, they rebounded to finish Friday at record highs.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones rose 6.44 points, or 0.02 per cent, to 27,681.24 and finished the week up 1.2 per cent.</p>

      <p>The S&amp;P 500 gained 7.9 points, or 0.26 per cent, to finish at 3,093.08 and was up 0.8 per cent for the week – its fifth straight week of gains.</p>
      <p>The Nasdaq added 40.8 points, or 0.48 per cent, to reach 8,475.31 and was also up 1.1 per cent for the week.</p>
