      <p>US President Donald Trump did not rule out that he would come to Moscow for the 9 May Victory Day parade.</p>
      <blockquote> “I appreciate the invitation. It is right in the middle of political season, so I’ll see if I can do it, but I would love to go if I could,” Trump said.</blockquote>
      <p>Earlier, Russian Presidential Aide Yuri Ushakov said that the leaders of 17 states have accepted invitations to the parade. He did not specify which countries he was talking about.</p>
      <p>At the same time, Ushakov emphasised that <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201911061077238214-indian-military-contingent-to-take-part-in-russias-victory-day-parade-in-2020/">delegations from India</a>, Cuba, France, the Czech Republic, Venezuela, Belarus, Armenia, Moldova, Serbia and several CIS countries will participate in the celebrations.</p>
      <p>Invitations were sent to other leaders in addition to Donald Trump. Among them are British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, DPRK President Kim Jong-un, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>
      <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin invited his American counterpart to the Victory Day gathering during a meeting on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Osaka. Trump then said that he would "seriously consider" the opportunity to come to Moscow.</p>
