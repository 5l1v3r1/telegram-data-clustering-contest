      <h2>The police are investigating the alleged theft of gift vouchers after they were delivered to the family's old address</h2>

      <p>A struggling family almost had their Christmas ruined after £1,100-worth of vouchers were delivered to the wrong address.</p>
      <p>The Holden family, from Nottinghamshire, had been saving all year round for Park Christmas Savings Vouchers, which helps them budget for the festive season.</p>
      <p>Dad Sean Holden, who has been out of work for several years as he has multiple sclerosis, said a number of family members had all chipped in for the vouchers, including his 88-year-old nan.</p>
      <p>He told <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/police-investigating-family-claim-1100-3516673">Nottinghamshire Live</a> : "People do it who are struggling.</p>
      <p>"We don't have a lot of money and family like my nan, she's 88, she's a pensioner, she's done it with us for a few years.</p>
      <p>"She always gives us £20 a month when she comes and sees us or I see her.</p>
      <p>"Then coming up towards Christmas it means that she's got £200-worth of vouchers that she can buy Christmas presents with it for her grandkids and her great-grandkids."</p>
      <p>Mr Holden said the money was collected by his wife Sandie and then paid to the company.</p>

      <p>Mr Holden, dad to sons Danny, 11, Alfie, eight, and Toby, three, said the vouchers were due for delivery earlier this week.</p>
      <p>However, having been able to track the delivery, the family said they realised the vouchers were being sent to their former home.</p>
      <p>They forgot to update their address with the voucher company.</p>
      <p>Mr Holden, who used to run pubs, said: "My wife tracked them and she said they're going to the old address.</p>
      <p>"So she was tracking them and they got signed for at 2.21pm on November 5.</p>
      <p>"Sandie went and picked the kids up from school and she went straight round to our old house, knocked on the door and the woman saw her through the window, she drew the blinds.</p>
      <p>"We rang the police to ask the police to come and help us but they couldn't get anyone out because they were very busy."</p>
      <p>Mr Holden said a woman in the property told them "she didn't know who had been in and out of her house so she couldn't say who had got them".</p>
      <p>Mr Holden said the vouchers were 'vital', explaining they could be used at various shops like Argos.</p>
      <p>He feared having to replace the money.</p>
      <p>However, the company confirmed it would reissue the vouchers.</p>

      <p>A spokesman for Park Christmas Savings said: "We apologise for some of the difficulties the family has experienced on this occasion, but this can sometimes happen if people move home and we’ve not been notified.</p>
      <p>"We know there are lots of priorities when people are moving home, so it can happen.</p>
      <p>"However, in order to ensure the family doesn’t miss out on an amazing Christmas this year, we’re happy to reissue the vouchers on this occasion and we’ll work with the police moving forward to help track and identify anyone spending the previously issued vouchers.”</p>
      <p>A Nottinghamshire Police spokesman said: "Officers were called following an alleged theft of gift vouchers.</p>
      <p>"The vouchers are believed to have been delivered to the victim's old home in Beeston on Tuesday, November 5.</p>
      <p>"Officers issued advice for the victim to call the voucher company from where they were purchased and to get them cancelled and reissued."</p>
      <p>The force spokesman added: "The victim is now working with the courier to confirm if the vouchers were delivered to the property."</p>
