      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-clarkson">Jeremy Clarkson</a> 's daughter Emily has turned down a place in the Winter version of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/love-island">Love Island</a> over fears she'd be put into the villa as the token "fat" girl.</p>
      <p>Journalist Emily Clarkson, 25, got a call from producers on the show earlier this week offering her the chance to jet to Cape Town for the next series.</p>
      <p>However, she turned down the offer and insisted she's not prepared to give up her boyfriend of eight years or accept the inevitable criticism of her bodyshape from viewers.</p>
      <p>In a column written for <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/opinion/10274794/i-turned-down-love-island/">The Sun</a> , Emily explained her reasons for rejecting the one way ticket to reality TV fame.</p>
      <p>She wrote: "On Thursday a producer at ITV rang, wanting to know if I was a) single and b) interested in appearing in the next series of Love Island.</p>
      <p>"And if I wasn't single but was interested, would I dump my boyfriend, Alex, for the opportunity...</p>

      <p>"I think what the producer was trying to tell me was that they wanted someone not quite as fit as the rest of them, but a bit smarter. No offence.</p>
      <p>"It was a flattering call... [But] I am so not Love Island - or the face of the inevitable Missguided deal every female Islander leaves with."</p>
      <p>The daughter of the former Top Gear presenter went on to insist that "stomach rolls and heat rash" would make her an easy target for trolls, and she couldn't face the shame of her parents seeing her have sex on TV.</p>

      <p>She concluded that she had to turn down the offer because the fleeting fame and clothing deals just aren't worth it.</p>
      <p>Emily explained: "I had to turn it down.</p>
      <p>"Not just because of my very long term relationship, or because I’m too sensitive to face the (inevitably cruel) judgement of the nation, or that I’d be the only one to have tummy rolls (plural), or that it would turn my life as I know it on it’s head.</p>
      <p>"I turned it down because I know that all that glitters is most certainly not gold, and no amount of Range Rover Sports would see me sell my soul to this particular devil."</p>

      <p>ITV confirmed earlier this year there will be two editions of the dating show in 2020 - the usual summer version and a brand new series that will kick off in January from South Africa.</p>
      <p>Following the huge record breaking success of this year's series, Love Island bosses are keen to capitalise on the ITV2 dating show's popularity with two series a year.</p>
      <p>As usual <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/caroline-flack">Caroline Flack</a> will be overseeing all the romantic connections - and rejections - as the host of the winter series.</p>

      <p>Comedian <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/iain-stirling">Iain Stirling</a> will also return to give his hilarious insights in the villa goings on.</p>
      <p>TV bosses are now in the process of whittling down single hopefuls to source a dream cast for the hotly anticipated series.</p>
      <p>Candidates still have until November, 30, 2019, to bag a place on the show.</p>
