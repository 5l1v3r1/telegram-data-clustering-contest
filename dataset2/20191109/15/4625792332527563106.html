      <p>A gender reveal in Texas ended in disaster after a plane carrying hundreds of gallons of pink water crashed.</p>
      <p>Although details are unclear, it appears the family was expecting the plane to dump out dyed water revealing the gender of their unborn baby. The incident happened in September, according to a National Transportation Safety Board <a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/brief2.aspx?ev_id=20190908X51027&amp;ntsbno=GAA19CA535&amp;akey=1">report</a> released Friday.</p>
      <p>The pilot was flying near Turkey, Texas, at a low altitude and began to dump about 350 gallons of pink water when the plane slowed down, “aerodynamically stalled, impacted terrain, and came to rest inverted.”</p>
      <p>There were two people on board the plane, and they suffered only minor injuries in the crash.</p>
