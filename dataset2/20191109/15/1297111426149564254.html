      <h1>Maple Creek man who caused fatal crash sentenced for manslaughter</h1>
      <h2>A man was handed a 10-year prison term for manslaughter after pleading guilty to swerving into oncoming traffic and hitting another vehicle.</h2>

      <p>Released from the mental health wing of Swift Current’s Cypress Regional Hospital earlier that day, Ronald Plummer attacked his wife, then caused a crash that claimed the life of an on-duty corrections officer from the Okimaw Ohci Healing Lodge.</p>
      <p>Lesa Zoerb, a 50-year-old mother of two from Maple Creek, was pronounced dead at the scene of the crash, which occurred just north of Maple Creek on Highway 21 on Oct. 7, 2018.</p>
      <p>Plummer was seriously injured himself and had to be airlifted to hospital.</p>
      <p>He was still using a walker when he appeared in a Swift Current courtroom earlier this week for sentencing. Plummer was originally charged with second-degree murder, but instead pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter. The 57-year-old also admitted to aggravated assault in relation to the attack on his wife.</p>
      <p>He was sentenced to 10 years in prison, less remand credit.</p>
      <p>While the precise nature of Plummer’s mental health issues weren’t provided during the sentencing, court heard those problems were behind the pair of offences.</p>
      <p>“Mr. Plummer has struggled with depression and anxiety for a number of years, but I would suggest like many men of Mr. Plummer’s vintage, (he) would put on a brave face and claims he did not want to burden others with his problems,” defence lawyer Ryan Nagel said.</p>
      <p>Crown prosecutor Curtis Wiebe said Plummer choked his wife so severely, she was found in a semi-conscious, non-responsive state inside the couple’s Maple Creek home. She’s since recovered and remains supportive of her husband.</p>
      <p>Following the assault, Plummer drove off, speeding north out of town in a Ford Escape. Within minutes — just before 8 p.m. — he spotted the southbound vehicle driven by Zoerb, a Ford Explorer. She was the lone occupant, on duty and headed back to the healing lodge.</p>
      <p>Investigators seized the “black box” of Plummer’s vehicle in the aftermath of the crash, determining he had veered sharply into Zoerb’s path, causing the collision. There was no evidence of braking on his part, and police discovered he’d been driving 149 kilometres per hour at the time of the crash.</p>
      <p>Nagel said his client is remorseful, and Plummer’s wife provided a brief written statement, saying, “I want people to understand mental health illness is a very real thing. Some people suffer alone, some suffer for years, with or without treatment, while others it just happens … If you have a loved one who suffers, the best thing you can do is be there and support them, the best you can and make sure you personally have support as well.”</p>
      <p>A number of victim impact statements were filed by Zoerb’s family and friends this week, speaking to her importance in their lives and the hole left by her loss.</p>
      <p>In September, <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/corrections-officer-lesa-zoerb-remembered-at-16th-annual-memorial-for-fallen-sask-police">Zoerb was honoured at the 16th annual Police and Peace Officers Memorial in Regina</a>, where she was remembered by family and friends as an outgoing animal lover who made friends easily and devoted 15 years of her life to public service.</p>
      <p>“It’s been a tough year,” her sister Debra Birkbeck said in September. “We are trying to pick up the pieces.”</p>
