      <p>Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has called on his followers on Twitter not to "give ammunition" to former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva whom he referred to as a 'scoundrel'.</p>

      <p>Bolsonaro's tweet comes in the wake of the release from prison of the former president of Brazil, Lula Da Silva.​</p>
      <h3>Lula's Imprisonment</h3>
      <p>Lula was put behind bars in April 2018, convicted of corruption and money laundering. Lula was initially handed a 12-year sentence. However, the courts reduced his sentence to eight years and 10 months in April.</p>
      <p>Lula was Brazil's president from 2003 to 2010 and had been among the favourites for the 2018 presidential election. His conviction presently bars him from running for political office.</p>
