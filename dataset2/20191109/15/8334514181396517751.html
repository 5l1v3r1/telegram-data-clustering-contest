      <p>(Reuters) - Austria’s Matthias Schwab maintained his consistency and carded a six-under par 66 to extend his overnight lead to three strokes after the third round at the Turkish Airlines Open in Antalya on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Schwab, who led by one at halfway, eagled the first hole and sank six more birdies — offset by a double bogey on the par four 12th — to go 18-under overall and lead five others tied for second at the Montgomerie Maxx Royal golf course.</p>
      <p>France’s Benjamin Hebert, England’s Tyrrell Hatton and Ross Fisher, American Patrick Reed and Scotland’s Robert MacIntyre trailed at 15-under overall to give Schwab a realistic chance of claiming his maiden title on the European Tour on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“The game plan is going to be the same as it’s been the last three days,” Schwab said. “The course is gettable and there are a lot of birdies out there, so I’ll just stay aggressive because pars won’t be enough.</p>
      <p>“I got off to a really nice start on the first hole with the eagle... and then played solid golf all around except for that one little hiccup I had on 12. Other than that, I was hitting them well, I made a few putts. Overall it was a good day.”</p>
      <p>Defending champion Justin Rose, who was two strokes behind Schwab heading into the weekend, dented his chances of accomplishing a three-peat after he shot a poor round of 73 to finish tied for 25th — nine strokes behind the Austrian.</p>
      <p>Schwab’s compatriot and Race to Dubai leader Bernd Wiesberger signed for a two-under par 70, which was his best round at the event so far, and was tied for 54th.</p>
      <p>The Open champion Shane Lowry carded a poor 75 to finish tied for 52nd at four-under overall.</p>
