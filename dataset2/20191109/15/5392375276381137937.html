      <p>OnePlus is a company that has not rested in recent years. With 4 flagship smartphones a year and scheduled releases every 6 months, it’s no wonder if the OnePlus 8 is already in the testing phase and made for manufacturing.</p>
      <p>That’s why these new <a href="http://www.slashleaks.com/l/oneplus-8-pro-prototype-spotted-live-in-china">images</a> make us think. This is reportedly a prototype of the OnePlus 8 or  8 Pro and there is a considerable difference from its predecessors.</p>
      <h3>OnePlus 8 Prototype has a punch-hole for the front camera</h3>

      <p>Regarding the OnePlus 7T, The Pro model has a front pop-up camera, however, the “normal” model has a notch. Well, the OnePlus 8 prototype shows us a small two-camera cutout in the upper right corner of the screen.</p>
      <p>I personally don’t think <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/OnePlus">OnePlus</a> will swap the “Pro” model pop-up camera for a hole in the screen. The brand boasts that it has a full screen and I don’t think it will give up on that model. So we can assume that this is the “normal” model right? OnePlus 8.</p>
      <p>But, we also have to discuss the rear of the device. This is because if this really is the OnePlus 8, the rear is completely different than the current 7T.</p>
      <h3>New color gradient never seen on the 7T series</h3>

      <p>Recall that OnePlus 7T was the first to incorporate camera modules into a circle. We then assume that this will be the design line of the future mobile phones.</p>
      <p>Importantly, the “Pro” model did not bring this ideology. That is, it may have been a simple experiment and realize to what extent these new lines are well accepted.</p>
      <p>Before you assume that this is a OnePlus 7T Pro from its rear, note that the alignment of the flash and rear cameras are different. That is a prototype of OnePlus. We just don’t know which one.</p>
