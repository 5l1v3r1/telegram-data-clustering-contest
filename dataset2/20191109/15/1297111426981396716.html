      <h1>Saskatchewan Roughriders being cautious with quarterback Cody Fajardo</h1>
      <h2>Quarterback Cody Fajardo was at Riders practice Friday, but didn't attempt a pass while recovering from an oblique injury.</h2>

      <p>Cody Fajardo went from being the West Division’s nominee for the CFL’s most outstanding player award Thursday to largely being a bystander on Friday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-quarterback-cody-fajardo-prepared-to-play-through-pain">The Saskatchewan Roughriders’ No. 1 quarterback is recovering from an oblique muscle injury that he suffered during a practice on Oct. 30.</a> He took a few snaps on Friday, but didn’t attempt a pass during a 90-minute practice at the AffinityPlex.</p>
      <p>“He’s still not going to throw,” Riders head coach Craig Dickenson said. “Even if he felt good or better, I wasn’t going to have him throw.</p>
      <p>“We felt that he needed to get out here with the guys, run through the plays, and call out the plays in the huddle. We didn’t want him throwing, but it was good to see him moving around.”</p>
      <p>The injury sidelined Fajardo for last Saturday’s 23-13 win over the visiting Edmonton Eskimos — a result that clinched first place in the West Division for the Riders for the first time in 10 years.</p>
      <p>Rookie Isaac Harker started against the Eskimos, completing 23 of 28 passes for 213 yards without a touchdown or an interception.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/riders-backup-qb-isaac-harker-is-ready-to-go-if-needed">Harker, who worked with the first-team offence for most of Friday’s session, welcomed Fajardo’s presence.</a>
      </p>
      <p>“He always sets the tone, whether it’s in meetings or lifting,” Harker said. “The team knows that he’s doing what’s best, but doing the mental stuff was what he felt he had to do (Friday). The team knows that he’s going to put us in the best position to succeed.”</p>
      <p>The Riders are enjoying a bye week and being atop the West for the first time since 2009 thanks in large part to Fajardo’s contributions.</p>
      <p>He was named the West’s all-star quarterback and received the aforementioned most outstanding player nomination after leading the CFL in passing yards (4,302) in his first season as a starter. He also completed 18 touchdown passes against eight interceptions while rushing for 10 majors.</p>
      <p>The Riders are to resume their on-field preparations on Wednesday for the division final against the winner of Sunday’s semi-final between the Winnipeg Blue Bombers and host Calgary Stampeders.</p>
      <p>Dickenson said he expects Fajardo to test the injury on Thursday, which features the heaviest workload of the week. Dickenson added that Fajardo isn’t able to go, Harker would be up “just like last week.”</p>
      <p>“You have to ask (Fajardo), but if I was a betting man, I would bet that he will be playing,” Harker said.</p>
      <p>Fajardo reiterated that position while meeting with the media on Thursday, pledging to play through the injury and to be on the field with his teammates on Nov. 17.</p>
      <p>“I’m not worried because if he’s healthy he’ll play and if he’s close to healthy, he’ll play,” said Riders middle linebacker Solomon Elimimian.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/steve-walsh-has-followed-an-eventful-path-to-the-saskatchewan-roughriders">That’s why Riders quarterbacks coach Steve Walsh felt it was important to have Fajardo on the field Friday, even in a limited role.</a>
      </p>
      <p>“It’s an opportunity because we’re starting to install things regardless of who we play,” Walsh said. “He wanted to make sure that he was staying up with everything that we’re doing. Right now, it’s more about mental preparation than physical.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>RIDERS BOLSTER QB DEPTH</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Riders announced the signing of quarterback Justice Hansen to the practice roster Friday.</p>
      <p>Hansen (6-foot-4, 224 pounds) recently spent time on the San Diego Chargers’ practice roster. Prior to that stint, he spent three seasons at Arkansas State, completing 27 touchdown passes against nine interceptions in his senior season.</p>
      <p>Dickenson said that Hansen’s addition provides the Riders with another quarterback due Fajardo’s injury. Fajardo’s injury left Harker and <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-backup-quarterback-bryan-bennett-making-a-name-for-himself-on-special-teams">Bryan Bennett</a> as the Riders’ healthy quarterbacks.</p>
      <p>“I don’t see (Hansen) playing this year,” Dickenson said. “We just wanted to get him familiar with the game and that our receivers have guys who can throw the ball to them.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>EVANS RESTED</b>
      </p>
      <p>West all-star receiver Shaq Evans was kept out of Friday’s practice.</p>
      <p>Evans, the Riders’ leading receiver with 1,334 yards, injured a toe during the victory over the Eskimos. The Riders are giving Evans as much time as he needs to recover.</p>
