      <h1>Unai Emery makes Nicolas Pepe admission after forward's slow start to life at Arsenal</h1>
      <h2>A number of unconvincing performances have left the club's fans feeling short changed, with Pepe unable to hold down a regular starting place</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T15:25:58+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 15:25</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Unai Emery has conceded that Nicolas Pepe's progress at Arsenal has been slower than anticipated - and urged the club-record signing to fight for a first-team spot.</p>
      <p>The forward joined the Gunners in a club record £70million deal from Lille in the summer.</p>
      <p>But a number of unconvincing performances have left the club's fans feeling short changed, with Pepe unable to hold down a regular starting place under Emery.</p>
      <p>He has shown glimpses of his undoubted talent on a number of occasions this season, including his stunning brace in the comeback Europa League win over Vitoria.</p>

      <p>However Emery knows his star man must do more, although he revealed that he expected the forward to take his time settling in.</p>
      <p>"He just needs time, and to be demanding of himself," Emery told Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>"We are with him, working individually with him and showing him videos of where he can improve.</p>
      <p>"The intensity of the game and the opponents in England demands a lot of you. He has to adapt to that, and we have to help him so that he can keep taking steps forward.</p>

      <p>"His process of adapting to the team is positive, but a little slower than what we wanted. We have to be patient as well as demanding and what’s more, we have to ensure that he takes responsibility himself.</p>
      <p>"He is not quite at the level yet to be able to play in every game. I believe, and I have always believed, that he needs to play in order to reach that level, but obviously there are also games when other players deserve to play. I use the players who I think are going to help us most in each moment.</p>
      <p>"But we bought Pepe knowing that the first year would be difficult, that it would be a year of adaptation.</p>
      <p>"We want that to happen as quickly as possible, but we are seeing that we have to have patience."</p>
