      <h1>Strictly bosses 'step up security' after stars sent chilling death threats</h1>
      <h2>Bosses at the BBC have reportedly hired a number of private security companies to provide protection for those deemed at risk</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T15:11:20+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 15:11</time> by <a rel="author">Louise Randell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/louise-randell/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> bosses have reportedly stepped up security after a number of stars were sent chilling death threats.</p>
      <p>Bosses at the BBC are said to have brought in a number of private security companies to provide protection for the celebrities, dancers and judges.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10310878/strictly-security-dancers-death-threats/">The Sun Online</a> , action was taken to offer round-the-clock security to anyone taking part that thinks they might be at risk.</p>
      <p>It comes after contestant Mike Bushell told the Mirror exclusively that he'd been sent a death threat warning him to quit the dance competition or be a "dead man".</p>
      <p>Head judge Shirley has also been sent worrying messages which have left others concerned for her safety.</p>
      <p>The worst of the trolling after she made the unpopular decision to send Corrie star Catherine Tyldesley home from the competition.</p>

      <p>Strictly bosses have faced threats before but they are believed to be particularly worried about the upcoming shows in Blackpool.</p>
      <p>Pro dancer Gorka Marquez was attacked in the town during the Strictly run there in 2016.</p>
      <p>Fellow pro AJ Pritchard was also beaten up in a vicious attack in a nightclub last year.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the threats he's faced, Mike told the Mirror exclusively that he couldn't understand why anyone would do that.</p>
      <p>He told us: "It said that unless I withdraw from the competition now I'm a dead man.</p>

      <p>"It was personal and I thought WTF. There are bigger things in the world to worry about.</p>
      <p>"I get that people have their own favourite dancers but it's an entertainment show at the end of the day and to get a death threat is ridiculous."</p>
      <p>Mike's dancer partner Katya Jones has also been targeted and she quit social media after being bombarded with abuse from vicious trolls.</p>
