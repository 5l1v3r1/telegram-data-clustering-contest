      <p>A teenager has been taken to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hospitals">hospital</a> after he was seriously assaulted and racially abused by a man riding a bike in Aberdeen.</p>
      <p>It happened on Friday night at around 5pm on Pittodrie Lane, close to the football ground.</p>
      <p>The 18-year-old victim was left with a facial injury following the incident, which was described as "despicable" by police.</p>
      <p>The suspect is described as a white man in his early 20s, around 6ft tall, with blonde facial hair and a slim build. He was wearing dark clothing with a hood up and was riding a black bicycle.</p>

Enquiries are ongoing and we are working to establish the circumstances leading up to this assault.</p>
      <p>“There would have been a number of people in the area around the time of the incident and we are keen to talk to anyone who might have seen anything.”</p>
      <p>The victim was taken to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aberdeen-royal-infirmary">Aberdeen Royal Infirmary</a> following the attack and released following treatment.</p>
