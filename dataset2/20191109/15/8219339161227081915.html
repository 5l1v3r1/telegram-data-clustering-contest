      <h1>Apple marks fall of Berlin Wall anniversary with special tribute on German Apple․com</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T15:12:31+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 15:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/chmiller44/" target="_blank">Chance Miller</a></address>
      <p>Today marks the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, and Apple is honoring the day with a message on the German Apple.com homepage. Apple CEO Tim Cook has also taken to Twitter to remember the day.</p>
      <p>On its German homepage, Apple has completely removed all product mentions and advertising. Instead, it is showing an image of the Berlin Wall, with the following quote attributed to a traditional folk song:</p>
      <blockquote>“For my thoughts tear the barriers and walls apart: the thoughts are free.”</blockquote>
      <p>Meanwhile on Twitter, Tim Cook said that today should remind everyone that unity is more powerful than differences:</p>
      <blockquote>Thirty years after the Berlin Wall fell, we must remember that the strength we possess in unity is infinitely more powerful than any differences that divide us.</blockquote>
      <p>It’s not out of the ordinary for Apple to redesign its homepage in remembrance of historically significant events. For instance, in the United States, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/01/21/martin-luther-king-jr-day-2019/">Apple regularly devotes</a> its homepage to celebrating Martin Luther King Jr. Day in January.</p>
