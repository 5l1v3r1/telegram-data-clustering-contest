      <h1>Teacher Charged After Video Shows Her Punching and Stomping on Student, Officials Say</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T15:56:06+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 15:56</time> by <a rel="author">Neil Vigdor</a></address>
      <p>A substitute teacher in Texas faces a felony charge of aggravated assault after the authorities said she repeatedly punched a student, threw her to the ground and stomped on her — an attack that was caught on video.</p>
      <p>The teacher, Tiffani Shadell Lankford, was arrested on Friday, the same day as the <a href="https://www.kxan.com/news/local/hays/hays-cisd-fires-lehman-high-school-substitute-teacher-for-hitting-student/">episode at Lehman High School</a> in Kyle, Texas, south of Austin, school and law enforcement officials said.</p>
      <p>The female student, 15, was taken to a hospital for evaluation, the Hays County Sheriff’s Office said. The student was sent home later from the hospital, a school district spokesman said.</p>

      <p>Ms. Lankford, 32, was immediately fired by the Hays Consolidated Independent School District, which refers to substitute instructors as guest teachers.</p>
      <p>“We take the safety and security of our students seriously,” Karen Zuniga, the school’s principal, wrote in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1189753088079135&amp;id=880243569030090&amp;__tn__=-R">letter posted on Facebook</a> on Friday. “We took swift action when this incident occurred and will do everything necessary to protect our students.”</p>
      <p>It was not immediately clear if Ms. Lankford had a lawyer. She remained in custody on Friday night and was scheduled to appear in court on Saturday, the authorities said.</p>

      <p>The altercation took place at 3:45 p.m. local time during a Spanish class, according to Tim Savoy, a school district spokesman, who said Ms. Lankford had filled in 18 times as a guest teacher since joining the district at the end of August.</p>
      <p>Mr. Savoy said he did not know what had led to the altercation.</p>
      <p>The sheriff’s office said Ms. Lankford’s arrest came after sheriff’s deputies reviewed several videos of the assault and also interviewed a number of students. The videos were taken by students, said Mr. Savoy, who noted that other students left the classroom to alert adult staff members about the altercation.</p>
      <p>One of the videos circulating on social media and on local television showed a teacher, who the sheriff’s office said was Ms. Lankford, punching a student three times before grabbing her by the shoulders and throwing her to the ground. Next, the video showed the teacher stomping on the student as she was face-down on the floor.</p>
      <p>“Under no circumstance is that behavior tolerated at Lehman High School or in Hays CISD,” wrote Ms. Zuniga, the school’s principal.</p>
