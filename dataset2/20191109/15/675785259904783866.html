      <p>A police officer has won an award for bravery after she single-handedly chased down thugs who hurled rocks and reversed into her with their car.</p>
      <p>PC Emma Birrell ended up in a high speed chase after she was tasked to follow a silver Audi linked to a burglary and was left needing hospital treatment after the frightening incident.</p>
      <p>The North Wales police officer followed the car through a village near Mold, North Wales, in April last year, reports <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/local-news/men-hurl-rocks-police-car-17227222">Wales Online.</a></p>
      <p>Shocking dash-cam footage from the patrol car, released by the Force, showed the Audi's brake lights illuminate before two men wearing balaclavas jump out and throw rocks at PC Birrell's vehicle, which shatter the windscreen.</p>
      <p>PC Birrell notified the police control room and gave chase to the car, which careered through Aston Hill and Ewloe at speeds in excess of 80mph.</p>

      <p>The high speed chase ended when the bungling crooks clipped something, causing one of the wheels on the Audi to fall off, on Old Aston Hill.</p>
      <p>PC Birrell stopped behind them, but as she began to get out of her vehicle the Audi reversed at speed into her car.</p>
      <p>The Force said her injuries were not serious but the officer was taken to hospital, and later received a Superintendent's Commendation for her bravery.</p>
      <p>Temporary Chief Inspector Dave Cust, of the Roads Policing Unit, said: "Other officers, including the Roads Policing Unit and local policing colleagues were making their way towards the incident, and PC Birrell, despite not knowing the danger she faced, continued to pursue the car whilst single-crewed.</p>
      <p>"This was a frightening incident for her and she displayed courage, tenacity and commitment to duty in order to apprehend the males involved.</p>
      <p>"This was an appalling act of dangerous driving and it was only by good fortune no one was injured."</p>

      <p>The four male occupants of the Audi were arrested shortly afterwards, with a spokesman saying one of the arresting officers was also injured.</p>
      <p>They were charged with various offences including burglary, dangerous driving, driving without insurance and driving whilst disqualified.</p>
      <p>The case was heard at Mold Crown Court yesterday and all four were locked up.</p>
      <p>Adam William Purcell, 30, of Priestfield Road, Ellesmere Port , was jailed for 42 months; Thomas Berry, 27, of College Fields, Tanyfron, Wrexham, was jailed for 20 months; Michael Doran, 26, of the caravan site on the old A43 in Broughton, was jailed for 20 months and Patrick Paul Doran, 33, of Ruthin Road in Wrexham, was jailed for three years.</p>
      <p>Detective Constable Lisa Evans, of Wrexham CID, said: "The sentence will I’m sure bring a degree of relief to many in the local community and I hope it will provide the public with some reassurance and make our communities safer.</p>
      <p>"All four men had a complete disregard for their victims and thought they could evade police detection.</p>
      <p>"It is thanks to great partnership work by our officers that these prolific criminals are now behind bars.</p>
      <p>"We fully understand the devastating impact that burglary has, both on the victims themselves and the wider community. North Wales Police will relentlessly pursue those individuals who cause most harm and this type of behaviour will not be tolerated.”</p>
      <p>Mark Jones, General Secretary of North Wales Police Federation said: "This is just one of many, many examples where our outstandingly brave police officers put their safety on the line for the protection of the public and to apprehend violent offenders.</p>
      <p>"The Police Federation passionately campaigns for tougher sentences on those who choose to attack emergency service workers so it is only proper that those convicted end up behind bars."</p>
