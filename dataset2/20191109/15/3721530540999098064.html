      <p><i>Desert Bus</i> for Hope, the <a href="https://desertbus.org/">original masochistic-gaming charity marathon</a>, lurched out of its station in virtual Tucson on Friday, and with it came the announcement of a game styled similarly to Penn &amp; Teller’s absurdist work from 25 years ago: <i>Airplane Mode</i>.</p>
      <p>Published by AMC (the <i>Walking Dead </i>and <i>Breaking Bad </i>network), <i>Airplane Mode </i>takes the, er, player on a real-time long-haul flight across the Atlantic. Developed by Hosni Auji, the game/social commentary will launch sometime in 2020 but an alpha build will be shown Tuesday during the weeklong livestream of <i>Desert Bus </i>for Hope.</p>
      <p>Features of <i>Airplane Mode </i>include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Chance of inclement weather and turbulence and other delays</li>
        <li>Possibility of bad/no WiFi access</li>
        <li>Overhead reading light and complementary aircraft information card</li>
        <li>“Fairly accurate satellite imagery of your flight path”</li>
        <li>A carry-on bag stocked with a book, headphones and charging cable</li>
        <li>“Authentic ambient noise” (specifically what is not said)</li>
        <li>In-flight magazine filled with travel articles, crossword and sudoku.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Look, if the crossword and sudoko are not already filled out, then this is not really a sim experience. Just sayin’. Also, that magazine better have a full-page ad for a professional matchmaker who looks like someone on <i>Knots Landing </i>circa 1986.</p>
      <p>“My interest in the game only grew when I learned it had been inspired by <i>Desert Bus</i> itself,” Andrew Ferguson one of the <i>Desert Bus </i>for Hope organizers, said in a statement. “Alt-games, experimental games, and ‘boring’ games push at the boundaries of what’s possible within the medium and it brings me genuine joy to be a small part of <i>Airplane Mode</i>’s launch.”</p>
      <p>The news release announcing the, er, game said <i>Airplane Mode </i>would also have an in-flight safety video produced by IFC, the indie film network also owned by AMC. IFC is the home of <i>Brockmire</i>, and most of its original programming has been in the comedy or satire genre, so this should be rather witty.</p>
      <p>AMC has partnered with other publishers to make video games before, mainly through <i>The Walking Dead</i><i> </i>franchise. But this will be the first one the network takes on under a new label, AMC Games.</p>
      <p><i>Desert Bus </i>for Hope is chuggin’ along as we speak, approaching its 24th hour of driving with about $140,000 raised for the Child’s Play Charity.</p>
