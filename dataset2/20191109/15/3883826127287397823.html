        <b>England began their autumn internationals with an impressive win over France - their first victory on French soil for seven years.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Red Roses dealt with early French pressure at a raucous Stade Marcel-Michelin, and captain Sarah Hunter then scored twice the before the break.</p>
      <p>New World Rugby player of the year Emily Scarratt was immaculate with the boot, kicking 10 points.</p>
      <p>Camille Boudaud went over for France in the second half but England held on.</p>
      <p>It was only a second defeat for French in 19 home games and the Red Roses' first win away in France since 2012.</p>
      <p>The sides meet again next weekend at Exeter's Sandy Park.</p>
      <h3>England lay down a marker</h3>
      <p>England and France have become the dominant teams in northern-hemisphere women's rugby, with one or the other winning the Six Nations in each of the past four years.</p>
      <p>France have been fearsome at home in that period; their only defeat on French turf since 2014 has been against world champions New Zealand.</p>
      <p>The hosts were once again cheered on by a passionate crowd at the home of club side Clermont-Auvergne - but despite a fast start, they were restricted by England's defence to just three points via a Jessy Tremouliere penalty.</p>
      <p>England, imposing at the line-out, grew into the game and scored twice in the final 10 minutes of the first half - Hunter going over on both occasions following good work from her fellow forwards.</p>
      <p>It was not a perfect performance from England; Marlie Packer was sin-binned in the second half and Boudaud scored France's try in the corner soon after, but it was one that laid down a marker before next year's Six Nations and the World Cup in 18 months' time.</p>
      <p>The Red Roses' first match of the 2020 Six Nations is away in France, a game that could well decide the tournament's winners.</p>
