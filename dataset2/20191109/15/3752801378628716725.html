      <p>A KwaZulu-Natal grade 8 pupil has been stabbed to death at a school in Ulundi.</p>
      <p>The incident, which took place on Friday at Ekudubeni Secondary School in Nkonjeni, has been confirmed by Kwazi Mthethwa, spokesperson of Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu.</p>
      <p>It is understood the pupil was stabbed by a fellow pupil, in grade 9, and died at the school, <a href="http://www.sabcnews.com/sabcnews/grade-eight-learner-killed-by-fellow-learner/">according to the SABC</a>. Police officers removed the suspect.</p>
      <p>On October 16, an <a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/maritzburg-high-school-pupil-stabbed-to-death-5-others-injured-education-dept-20191016">Eastwood Secondary School pupil</a> in Pietermaritzburg died after being stabbed, while five others were hospitalised.</p>
      <p>Earlier in that week, a girl was also stabbed in the buttocks.</p>
      <p>Mthethwa said the incidents come after the launch of a school safety programme in September, which has recruited 1 500 community volunteers to be trained by the provincial Department of Community Safety.</p>
      <p>In response to the incident, the education department is calling on residents to report violence in schools, and on parents to raise their children with discipline, Mthethwa says.</p>
