      <p>The blockchain is called as a machine that transfers trust and value, combining financial technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and big data on driving the global economic transformation from the era of information into the era of internet value. In this era, asset chaining, traditional asset migration, and equity chaining have become the trend of the times. Accordingly, global digital asset trading has become a new generation of the billion-dollar market.</p>
      <p>From 11th to 13th November, the 2019 Singapore Fintech Festival will be held in the Expo Convention and Exhibition Center in Singapore.
