      <p>Take what you will of <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/helena-bonham-carter-the-crown-princess-margaret.html">Helena Bonham Carter</a>’s psychic anecdote about Princess Margaret, who, weeks before officially deciding to take the royal role <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2019/10/the-crown-season-3-trailer-olivia-colman-netflix-watch.html">on <i>The Crown</i></a>, received this message from her non-showbiz medium: M-A-R-G-A-R-E-T. Spooky stuff, right? Carter made the best of it, asking the deceased princess if it was okay to portray her, and the response was equal parts a backhanded compliment and a demand. “I said, <i>Would you mind if I played you? </i>And she said I was a better idea from the other actor,” Carter explained. “She came through with another note. She said, <i>Get the smoking right. </i>I smoked in a particular way and always remember that the cigarette holder is as much as a weapon for expression as anything else. She was someone who was innately dramatic.” And innately spectral, apparently.</p>
