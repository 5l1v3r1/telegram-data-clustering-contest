      <p>Robservations …</p>
      <p>• Saskatchewan Roughriders fans should be cheering quite strenuously for the Winnipeg Blue Bombers to defeat the host Calgary Stampeders in Sunday’s CFL West Division semi-final. The winner will advance to the division final, set for Nov. 17 at Mosaic Stadium. The Roughriders have proven that they can beat Winnipeg, having won two of three regular-season meetings. Calgary, by contrast, presents a puzzle for a Saskatchewan side that was 0-for-2 against the Stampeders.</p>
      <p>• Calgary starting quarterbacks Nick Arbuckle and Bo Levi Mitchell combined for only nine incompletions against Saskatchewan during the 2019 regular season. <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/rob-vanstone-saskatchewan-roughriders-still-need-stamp-of-excellence">Former Roughriders head coach Chris Jones had figured out a way to solve Mitchell, but first-year defensive co-ordinator Jason Shivers — for all he has accomplished this season — is still searching for that elusive formula</a>. Plus, do you really want to face Mitchell with a Grey Cup berth at stake? No thanks.</p>

      <p>• Ink-stained scribes who kill trees for a living also cheer for the best angle, which is unquestionably the return of Zach Collaros to Mosaic Stadium if he pilots Winnipeg past Calgary on Sunday. Collaros began the season with the Roughriders, only to be concussed on the third play of the opener. <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-quarterback-cody-fajardo-named-west-divisions-most-outstanding-player">Cody Fajardo took over behind centre and soon became a star</a>, rendering Collaros expendable.</p>

      <p>• In November of last year, the Jones-coached Roughriders played all sorts of silly games in the week leading up to the West semi-final against the visiting Blue Bombers. Would a concussed Collaros play? Nobody would say. Collaros appeared at a media conference the day before the game — the presence of a quarterback ordinarily being an indication that he is to start — but was nonetheless idle the following day. By all indications, Roughriders field boss Craig Dickenson will be more forthcoming as people clamour for updates on Fajardo, who is nursing an oblique injury that rendered him a non-participant in Friday’s practice.</p>

        <figcaption>Veteran Saskatchewan Roughriders centre Dan Clark is richly deserving of West Division all-star honours, according to columnist Rob Vanstone.<cite>Troy Fleece / Regina Leader-Post</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>• Much has been made — and rightfully so — of Fajardo being named the West’s all-star quarterback and most outstanding player. But the feel-good story of the week was the announcement that <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/riders-dan-clark-doesnt-take-o-line-award-for-granted">Dan Clark</a> had been named the West’s all-star centre. Clark, who hails from Regina, advanced to the CFL from the PFC’s Regina Thunder. He has not taken a single second of his time with the Roughriders for granted. Nobody has worked more tirelessly in the community, especially while spreading the anti-bullying message. Shortly before training camp, he survived a motor-vehicle accident and was still ready for opening day. And now he’s an all-star, for the first time, at age 31. The accolades are richly deserved.</p>
      <p>• Fittingly, Clark is the Roughriders’ nominee for the 2019 Jake Gaudaur Veterans’ Award, which recognizes a Canadian CFL player who demonstrates the attributes of Canada’s veterans: strength, perseverance, courage, comradeship and contribution to Canadian communities. The winner will be announced Nov. 21 during the CFL awards presentations in Calgary.</p>
      <p>• <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/solomon-elimimian-proving-doubters-wrong-in-first-season-with-saskatchewan-roughriders">Roughriders middle linebacker Solomon Elimimian</a>, also a West all-star, deserves a shout-out. Far too late in the off-season, Elimimian was released by the B.C. Lions, who felt that he was a player in decline. It turned out that the Lions were a team in decline, winning only five games after posting nine victories in 2018. Elimimian went on to become a sixth-time West all-star while helping Saskatchewan post its best record since 1970. He is far too much of a pro to revel in the misfortunes of his former team, but everything that has transpired since he was released by the Lions looks good on both parties.</p>
      <p>• The Riders added quarterback Justice Hansen to the practice roster on Friday. The roster already includes linebacker <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/linebacker-cameron-judge-returns-to-saskatchewan-roughriders-active-roster">Cameron Judge</a>. Plus, running back Judge Thomas was briefly a member of the 1980 Roughriders. Are there any other legal names you can think of in Roughriders history? (Alas, Lawyer Milloy and Lawyer Tillman never played here. Hopefully, one day, Cordarro Law will suit up for Saskatchewan.)</p>
      <p>• Adam Stuart (@adamstuart1) chimed in on Twitter with a fabulous suggestion: Paul LaPolice!</p>
      <p>• And here’s one from Regina Leader-Post legend Ian Hamilton: Chuck Foreman! (A non-Roughrider, yes, but I couldn’t resist.)</p>
      <p>• One more from me: Council Rudolph, an original member of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Onwards …</p>

      <p>• If the CFL had an executive of the year award,<a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/qa-jeremy-oday-looks-ahead-to-riders-2019-season"> Roughriders general manager and vice-president of football operations Jeremy O’Day</a> would be the easy winner.</p>
      <p>• Since 1977, the Roughriders have won and played host to Grey Cup games more often than they have staged a West final. Saskatchewan won championships in 1989, 2007 and <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/looking-back-on-the-roughriders-2013-grey-cup-win-robs-green-time-machine">2013</a> and held Grey Cup festivals in 1995, 2003 and 2013. The Nov. 17 game will be only the second West final in Regina in a span of 43 seasons. The Roughriders were also at home for the 2009 West final — a 27-17 victory over Calgary.</p>

        <figcaption>The design of the original Wascana Pool should be a template for a new aquatics facility, according to Rob Vanstone.<cite>Brandon Harder / Regina Leader-Post</cite></figcaption>

      <p>• Free, unsolicited advance for the City of Regina: <a href="https://leaderpost.com/opinion/letters/letters-to-the-editor-nov-7-2019-for-wascana-pool-rectangular-design-is-just-fine">Use the original Wascana Pool as a template for a new aquatics facility. Update it, and throw in a few new frills, but don’t deviate too severely from the civic jewel of a pool that served our city so well from 1947 to Sept. 15 of this year.</a></p>
      <p>• Free, unsolicited advice to the Roughriders and the City of Regina: If the Green and White wins the title on Nov. 24 in Calgary, hold the victory parade on Nov. 26 — the 30th anniversary of <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/rob-vanstone-celebrating-the-greatest-grey-cup-30-years-later">Saskatchewan’s 43-40 victory over the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in the greatest Grey Cup game ever played</a>. Consider, too, that Roughriders punter Jon Ryan turns 38 on Nov. 26.</p>
      <p>• Free publicity for my book: “100 Things Roughriders Fans Should Know &amp; Do Before They Die” is now widely available.</p>
