      <p>A BELFAST pizzeria has been fined and ordered to pay compensation for food safety breaches.</p>
      <p>The fine imposed at Belfast Magistrates Court yesterday came after Belfast Woodfired Pizza Company on the city's Lisburn Road failed to tell a customer with a food allergy that their order contained nuts, when in fact one of the ingredients were cashew nuts.</p>
      <p>However, the customer had a nut allergy and suffered an anaphylactic reaction after eating a slice of vegan cheese pizza and was subsequently hospitalised.</p>
      <p>Belfast Woodfired Pizza Company pleaded guilty to a complaint of placing food that was deemed unsafe and considered injurious to health to a specific category of consumers on the market.</p>
      <p>The restaurant was fined £1,000 and ordered to pay compensation of £2,500 to the injured customer.</p>
