      <p>BELFAST life sciences company Intelesens, which makes devices for the global healthcare market, has opened a new electrode manufacturing suite at its development facility on Heron Road.</p>
      <p>The facility, which meets all the rigorous requirements of global regulation, comprises 3,500 sq ft of manufacturing with an additional 1,000 sq ft of dedicated research and development facilities, and equates to a £250,000 investment.</p>
      <p>The company, founded in 2001 as a spin-out from Ulster University, says it will allow the business to grow the electrode business in line with its clients' expansion plans as well as offer a unique service to new clients interested in serving the growing electrode market worldwide.</p>
      <p>Intelesens, which was acquired by Renew Group in August 2017, develops and manufactures defibrillation electrodes at the Belfast facility, which are used in some of the world's leading AED devices.</p>
      <p>It has also developed a range of wearable wireless vital signs monitoring devices to be worn by the patient both in-hospital and or at home.</p>
      <p>Managing director Declan Cassells said: “I'm delighted, to announce the opening of this new state-of-the-art facility for our electrode business.</p>
      <p>“The upgrading and expansion of our operation is a result of the growing demand of our quality electrode products for our clients and allows us the opportunity to grow and expand on our success to date.”</p>
      <p>As well as an established list of clients which includes multinational companies, Intelesens also provides a range of services including concept proposal to commercialisation, and full-scale manufacturing of bespoke electrodes for the healthcare market.</p>
