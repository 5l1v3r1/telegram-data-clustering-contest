      <p>Citing the "latest guidance" received in communications with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Department of Transportation and Boeing, American Airlines <a href="http://news.aa.com/news/news-details/2019/The-Latest-Information-About-737-MAX-Operations/default.aspx">noted</a> that the decision to extend its flight cancellations comes in line with the 737 MAX's anticipated certification and return to commercial service. </p>
      <p>Formal schedule changes for future American Airlines flights will take place on November 17. </p>
      <blockquote>The airline previously grounded the 737 MAX planes through January 15, 2020, following <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201904081073908352-usa-boeing-max-flights/">a number of setbacks</a> tied to the aircraft's Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), which was cited as the main culprit in the Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashes that killed a total of 346 people. </blockquote>
      <p>Southwest Airlines, which <a href="https://sputniknews.com/business/201910241077132357-high-hopes-boeing-aims-to-return-737-max-jets-to-skies-before-end-of-2019/">purchased 34</a> of the now-grounded aircraft to replace its oldest fleet of jets, also readjusted its timetable on Friday and pushed back scheduling flights on its 737 Max jetliners until March 6, 2020. </p>
      <blockquote>The airlines' decisions come not long after it was reported that Boeing not only suffered a major drop in revenue, but also experienced <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201910121077030134-boeing-board-of-directors-splits-ceo-chairman-roles-amid-ongoing-737-max-fixes/">a shift in leadership</a> and was <a href="https://sputniknews.com/science/201910191077090647-i-basically-lied-boeing-officials-discussed-737-max-issues-years-prior-to-crashes/">publicly reprimanded by the FAA</a> for withholding information concerning one of the earliest reports of an error within the notorious MCAS. </blockquote>
      <p>Boeing <a href="https://www.boeing.com/commercial/737max/737-max-software-updates.page">claims</a> their updated MCAS system, which has to be certified by the FAA along with the 737 MAX, will accurately “enhance pitch stability." </p>
