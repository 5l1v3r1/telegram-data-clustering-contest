      <p>NEW DELHI: India Inc has petitioned the government and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to review the market regulator’s new rule mandating a split in the post of chairman and managing director of a company, while also barring relatives to hold the key jobs.</p>
      <p>Following the recommendations of a committee headed by Uday Kotak, Sebi has asked the top 500 companies by market capitalisation to split the top job from April. From April 2021, the next set of 500 companies will see the CMD post split.</p>
      <p>Corporate captains have argued that even mature and developed economies such as the US, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Canada">Canada</a>, France, Japan and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/South-Korea">South Korea</a> do not have such prescriptions and are in conflict with the provisions of the Companies Act, which has left the decision to shareholders. In fact, the corporate affairs ministry was not keen on accepting the proposals when the Kotak committee submitted its report but did not oppose the plan at the board meeting. Sources said, the government is going to leave it to Sebi to decide on whether it intends to go ahead with the proposal or not.</p>
      <p>While finding such large number of professionals is also seen to be a challenge, in a representation to finance minister and corporate affairs minister Nirmala Sitharaman, industry chamber Ficci has said that 90% of the businesses in the country are family-run — mom-and-pop stores to SMEs and large conglomerates such as the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/TATA-Group">Tata Group</a> or the Birlas, Munjals, Godrej or the Adanis.”...it cannot be denied that over the years, most Indian family businesses have been garnering stronger top-line growth than their non-family peers,” the chamber said.</p>
      <p>It also pointed to a Credit Suisse study of 1,015 family businesses to argue that over 10 years, the revenue growth of family businesses was 2.4 times compared to1.6 times in case of non-family entities with margins in case of the former being two percentage points higher.The111Indian companies on the global list were generating 7% addiitonal returns compared to their non-family owned peers.</p>
      <p>Questioning the absence of conclusive evidence to suggest effective board leadership, Ficci has proposed that a lead independent director be appointed to balance the power equations on board where the roles of the chairman and the chief executive are combined and cited the experience in France, Spain and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Italy">Italy</a>.</p>
