      <h1>U.N. Hosts Exhibit on Iran's 'Human Rights Achievements'</h1>

      <p>“The promotion of human rights [is] the Islamic Revolution’s raison d’être,” <a href="https://en.mfa.ir/portal/NewsView/551969">declared</a> Iran’s foreign ministry in a statement published Thursday, highlighting a five-day exhibition of slides and posters celebrating its “human rights achievements” at the United Nations (U.N.) Office in Geneva, Switzerland.</p>
      <p>Iran’s foreign ministry shared images of its U.N. display via its Twitter profile:</p>

      <p>The exhibition reportedly drew attendance from representatives of Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, China, Estonia, North Korea, Oman, Pakistan, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela.</p>
      <p>“Neither the eight-year imposed war nor the wave of terrorism could divert the Islamic Revolution away from the path to democracy and regard for the people’s human dignity,” said Esmaeil Baqaei Hamaneh, Iran’s envoy to and representative at the U.N. in Geneva.</p>
      <p>“[The exhibition showcases] Iran’s advances in supporting and promoting human rights in various areas, such as the women’s rights, children’s rights, rights of religious minorities, respect for cultural and ethnic diversity, and rights of disabled persons,” claims Iran’s foreign ministry.</p>
      <p>“<a href="https://en.mehrnews.com/news/151977/Human-rights-at-hard-core-of-Islamic-Revolution">Preserving</a> human rights is at the hard core of the Islamic Revolution,” according to Mehr News Agency, an Iran-based and state-aligned news media outlet.</p>
      <p>U.S. sanctions on Iran are violative of “human rights,” according to Iran, describing its subjects as entitled to a “right to health” and “right to access to medication.”</p>
      <p>The Iranian state <a href="https://lib.ohchr.org/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/Session20/IR/Iran2ndCycle.pdf">describes</a> itself as “based” on “principles of independence, freedom, and progressive Islamic beliefs,” as well as “the principles of democracy.”</p>
      <p>According to Amnesty International, Iran <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2019/01/24/amnesty-international-iran-arrests-7000-dissidents-year-shame/">arrested</a> over 7,000 dissidents in 2018, killing at least 28 of them. Death row inmates in Iran have their organs <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2019/07/08/report-iran-allows-death-row-prisoners-to-sell-organs-before-or-after-execution/">harvested</a> “voluntarily” before or after execution. In April, Iran <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2019/04/29/iran-sentences-lawyer-hijab-protesters-148-lashes-38-years-prison/">sentenced</a> an award-winning female human rights lawyer to 148 lashes and 38 years of imprisonment for defending Muslim women’s prerogative to remove the Islamic Republic’s mandatory hijab in public.</p>
      <p>The U.S. is the largest single-state donor to the U.N., with Congress having <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/IF10354.pdf">approved</a> $5.8 billion across the regular budget for 2018-2019, or $2.9 billion per year. This does not include additional “peacekeeping” funding of $6.51 billion across the same time frame, or $3.25 billion per year.</p>
      <p>“Billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars have funded the U.N.,” U.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell told Breitbart News. “This type of propaganda on display in the lobby of the U.N. is disgusting and morally bankrupt.”</p>
      <p>“Since 2017, the Trump Administration has proposed significant overall decreases in U.S. funding; however, Congress has generally funded U.N. entities at higher levels than the Administration has requested,” according to a September-published report from the Congressional Research Service on U.S. funding of the U.N. network of organizations.</p>
