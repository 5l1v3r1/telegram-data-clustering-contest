      <h2>Robert Norris was one of the most recognisable men of the 1960s but no-one really knew his actual name as he was known everywhere as the face of Marlboro cigarettes</h2>

      <p>Robert Norris, who was the original Marlboro Man, has died aged 90.</p>
      <p>He became an advertising icon in the 60s as he was plastered across billboards and magazine pages with a cowboy hat on his head and a cigarette in his hand.</p>
      <p>Ironically, Robert never lit up a cigarette in real life and never smoked despite being the poster boy for the habit for a generation.</p>
      <p>TMZ has reported that he died last Sunday, at his ranch in Colorado Springs.</p>
      <p>Legend has it that Norris got his big break by posing in a photograph with actor John Wayne, who was a longtime friend.</p>

      <p>Advertising executives were so taken by his look when they saw the photo in a newspaper, they set about tracking him down, eventually finding him at his 63,000-acre ranch in Colorado.</p>
      <p>It was deemed that Norris had the perfect cowboy character - genuine and rugged. After being asked to be involved, he ended up 'doing it as a favour' rather than thinking it would be the role that defined him.</p>

      <p>For 12 years, Norris was the Marlboro Man but he eventually quit after he thought that the adverts were setting a bad example to children.</p>
      <p>Away from his iconic role, Norris was known for being a philanthropist and businessman, as well as being a rancher.</p>

      <p>He was also actively involved with rodeo events and was a member of several organisations that promoted the sport.</p>
      <p>His wife passed away in 2016 at the age of 88 and Norris is survived by his two sons and two daughters.</p>
