      <p>CHICAGO (Reuters) - American Airlines Group Inc said on Friday it is extending cancellations of Boeing Co 737 MAX flights through March 4, 2020, mirroring an earlier announcement by Southwest Airlines.</p>
      <p>American had previously canceled about 140 flights a day through Jan. 15 and now expects a return to service on March 5.</p>
      <p>Southwest said on Friday it would remove Boeing 737 MAX jets from its schedule until March 6, 2020, just shy of the one-year anniversary of an Ethiopian Airlines crash of the jet that led to a worldwide grounding.</p>
