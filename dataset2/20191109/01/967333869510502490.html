        <b>Former US President George W. Bush, 73, took questions about politics from former press secretary - now Fox News anchor - Dana Perino, in Crawford, Texas, on Friday, where the 43rd occupant of the Oval Office was participating in a 100-kilometer bike race intended to benefit US military veterans.</b>

      <blockquote>“I’m optimistic about the future because as you mentioned democracy is self-healing. This is an unsettled period in our country, but it isn't the first time we have had unsettled periods”, <a href="https://video.foxnews.com/v/6102013790001/#sp=show-clips">Bush told</a> his former press secretary.</blockquote>
      <p>The answer came after Perino asked Bush to <a href="https://sputniknews.com/radio_the_critical_hour/201812041070362787-george-bush-analysis-america-president/">think about the legacy his father</a>, George H.W. Bush, who was the US president when the Berlin Wall fell 30 years ago.</p>
      <p>The younger Bush said, however, that the country's course <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201910171077068008--george-w-bush-brands-trumps-isolationist-america-as-dangerous-for-global-peace--report/">could be straightened</a> but he hinted that he might not see that day coming in his life.</p>
      <blockquote>“I won't be around to see my grandkids thrive and prosper, but I am convinced the world they’ll be entering into will be unique and full of all kinds of possibilities”, the former US president said.</blockquote>
      <p>Jeb Bush - a younger brother of George - briefly <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201901191071631474-george-w-buch-pizza-delivery-shutdown/">ran against Donald Trump</a> in 2016 for the Republican Party seat in the US presidential nomination. The twice-elected former governor of Florida pulled out of the race after being defeated in the South Carolina primary.</p>
      <p>In 2017, Bush said that American discourse had been “degraded by casual cruelty”, has seen “nationalism distorted into nativism”, and witnessed “the return of isolationist sentiments” in recent years.</p>
      <p>In the Friday interview, the 43rd US President made no direct remark in regard to the policy of the current US president, Donald Trump.</p>
