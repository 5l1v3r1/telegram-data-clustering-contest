      <h1>Friday's Pats-Broncos game postponed due to ice issue</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T01:03:01+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 01:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/gregharderlp" target="_blank">Greg Harder</a></address>
      <p>The Regina Pats announced about 20 minutes before game-time on Friday night that their scheduled WHL meeting with the Swift Current Broncos at the Brandt Centre was being postponed.</p>
      <p>The last-minute decision was made due to “an ice-plant issue” which left the ice surface “unplayable.”</p>
      <p>The game will be rescheduled at a later date and all tickets from Friday’s contest are redeemable. More ticket information will be released in the future.</p>
      <p>Friday’s game would have been the first meeting of the season between the Pats (2-11-2-0) and Broncos (3-10-1-2).</p>
      <p>Regina’s next action is a road game on Saturday night against the Winnipeg Ice. That’s followed by six scheduled days off before meeting the Prince Albert Raiders next Saturday at the Brandt Centre.</p>
