      <p>An “entertaining” story about their granny, their cat, or just their walk to work: Some people just need to express their thoughts and can’t stop. Of course, it’s important to be polite and to not interrupt people, but this might get to a point where they start wasting your time on their mindless things. So, the most important thing to do here is to “fight” for yourself and know how to escape these people.</p>
      <p><b>Bright Side</b> brought you a list of 8 useful tips that can help you to finish any conversation that has gone way too far. Don’t worry, you won’t look ill-mannered, because you will know how to do it with style. Let’s get started!</p>

        <img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_79/794715/15154788-86533810-aaf0e8f63d097f63c3a7b8ed12425d82c3891be0-1572791101-6215-1-1572791101-728-32e9147584-1573201706.jpg"/>

      <h3>1. Listening politely</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_79/794715/15154789-84159060-97b49fb71098ae9b7c5c7fcaa05f864bfd5d0249-6215-1-1572410325-728-32e9147584-1573201706.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The first step is to listen with patience. It’s important to <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-couch/201204/5-steps-dealing-people-who-talk-too-much">figure out</a> what this person is trying to tell you. Maybe, there is an important thought that they are trying to express or a feeling they need to show. Or maybe, they want to be admired. If it’s something really important, the speech shouldn’t take too long.</p>
      <h3>2. Asking often what the main point is</h3>
      <p>It can happen that the person just keeps deviating from the topic, talking more about the irrelevant things and details. In this case, it will be good to remind them what the main point of your conversation is. You can also question them about it, so they will have to return from heaven to earth. After all, it’s good to show people that they need to respect your time.</p>
      <h3>3. Asking if you can interrupt them</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_79/794715/15154790-84159160-eed9e6093ee88740b5623620e155066fa05ca2f8-6215-1-1572410387-728-32e9147584-1573201706.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>If after all your previous attempts to finish the conversation, they still don’t stop, then it might be high time to be more assertive. You can ask them politely, but confidently, if they mind if you <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-couch/201204/5-steps-dealing-people-who-talk-too-much">interrupt </a>them. Some of them might realize that the conversation has dragged on for too long and some of them might ask you to let them finish their thought.</p>
      <p>Here it’s fine to let them finish, since you don’t really have a choice. But as soon as you feel that they are going to move on to another topic, this is your chance to interrupt them again.</p>
      <h3>4. Turning the tables</h3>
      <p>After interrupting them, you can “turn the tables.” Instead of stopping the conversation completely, you can add a comment about them. <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-couch/201204/5-steps-dealing-people-who-talk-too-much">Adding</a> a similar mindless story about yourself, your dog, or your friend might actually have a positive effect. You will make them experience how you feel and they might stop talking.</p>
      <h3>5. Telling them you have no time</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_79/794715/15154791-84159360-2a6ee34ebe188d13714277e3cd9f143e1c353b3b-6215-1-1572410428-728-32e9147584-1573201706.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Sometimes, people just can’t take a hint. It won’t do any harm to push them a bit more. By telling them you don’t have <a href="https://coachingforleaders.com/stop-talking/">time</a> anymore to listen to them, you will show that you are very busy at this moment and can’t be disturbed anymore. You can add that as soon as you are done with your work, you can finish the conversation. And if it happens that they actually come back to finish their talk, you can always say, “Not now, I’m still busy.”</p>
      <h3>6. Agreeing on a specific talk time</h3>
      <p>Reminding them that you have a tight schedule can also do the trick. In some cases, you can even complain about the lack of time and the amount of things that need to be done. If you see that they really want to finish their talk, then propose a specific <a href="https://www.quickanddirtytips.com/health-fitness/mental-health/how-to-deal-with-people-who-talk-too-much?page=1">time</a> when you can do it again. While doing this, you can emphasize one more time that it is not that easy for you to choose it, as you have a lot of work to get done.</p>
      <h3>7. Showing your dislike</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_79/794715/15154792-86533960-d7d304b0231f5f0441dab28fb2c92428e85ec273-1572791232-6215-1-1572791232-728-32e9147584-1573201706.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>It can happen that they don’t care about anything and just can’t stop talking. They just want to tell their life story to anyone who they meet on their path. If none of your tricks to stop their speech worked, then you might just show that you dislike the situation. Your body language together with your annoyed facial expression will show them that their speech is not welcome anymore.</p>
      <h3>8. Just leaving</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_79/794715/15154793-84159560-77fb4ac3f6ab430f8d3e66b6851de9f977059ca0-6215-1-1572410566-728-32e9147584-1573201706.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>It’s rude, but effective. If it gets to the point where they are stopping you from doing your tasks and ignoring your body language, then this can be a sign for you. Yes, it’s time to just <a href="https://fairygodboss.com/articles/people-who-talk-too-much-at-work">leave</a>. After all, enough is enough, you have your own life and things you need to concentrate on.</p>
      <p>Have you ever met someone who can’t stop talking? How do you deal with these people? Let’s share our stories in the comment section!</p>
