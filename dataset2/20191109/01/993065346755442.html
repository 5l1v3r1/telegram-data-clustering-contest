      <p>The vote in favour of strike action by nurses in Northern Ireland is an unprecedented move although hardly unexpected given the well-documented warnings about frustration among those at the frontline of a health service in crisis.</p>
      <p>More than 8,000 Royal College of Nursing (RCN) members were balloted over the past four weeks with 43 per cent responding.</p>
      <p>Of those, 96 per cent voted to take industrial action short of a strike while 92 per cent voted for outright strike action.</p>
      <p>It is the first time in the RCN's 103-year history that members have voted to strike, which is an indication of the depth of feeling among nurses.</p>
      <p>This is not something that has happened overnight but has been building up over years as nurses face increased demands and pressure in a health service that is under enormous strain.</p>
      <p>According to Pat Cullen, director of the RCN in Northern Ireland, the major issue facing nurses is the shortage of staff, with 3,000 posts currently vacant.</p>
      <p>This clearly has a major impact on patients, on the continuity of nursing care and the number of staff required to do the job safely and effectively.</p>
      <p>Pay is also a concern although Ms Cullen says that for many nurses getting wages up to an acceptable level is 'further down the agenda than safe staffing'.</p>
      <p>However, the fact that nurses are getting less for doing the same job as their NHS counterparts in Britain is plainly having a detrimental effect on the recruitment and retention of staff.</p>
      <p>In such circumstances it is reasonable for the RCN to argue that pay and staffing levels are 'inextricably linked' and until the wage disparity is addressed, we will continue to see qualified nurses leaving Northern Ireland for better conditions elsewhere.</p>
      <p>It also has to be recognised that while these are not new concerns, our present situation, with Stormont suspended and no ministers in place to take decisions, does not help to solve a problem that requires both money and strategic decision-making.</p>
      <p>There will be widespread support for nurses and the important and valued job they do in challenging circumstances.</p>
      <p>But people will also hope that a satisfactory resolution can be found to legitimate grievances before staff move towards industrial action.</p>
