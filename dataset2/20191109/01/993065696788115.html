      <p>Cliftonville will be hoping to prevent any optimism that may possibly remain in the Warrenpoint changing room, as Barry Gray makes his return to Solitude since being sacked in January 2018.</p>
      <p>With the season well and truly under way, it would be fair to say that Cliftonville are exceeding expectations.</p>
      <p>With the joint-best defensive record (tied with Coleraine and Linfield), no goals conceded in October, Joe Gormley leading the race for the golden boot as he continues to break more records, and just one point</p>
      <p>from the league leaders, Coleraine; things are looking good for Paddy McLaughlin’s North Belfast Reds.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately for Barry Gray, the same cannot be said for Warrenpoint Town.</p>
      <p>One of the league’s youngest sides, Warrenpoint has had a rather-disastrous start to the season.</p>
      <p>The Reds' record goal scorer was recently hailed as a "Cliftonville legend" by their manager, Paddy McLaughlin.</p>
      <p>With Gormley looking forward to seeing Gray on his first game back at Solitude.</p>
      <p>“It’ll be great to see Barry again, he’s a great guy and it’s good to see him back in management, but we’re fully focused on the three points.”</p>
      <p>“We’ve improved a lot and what we're working on is really starting to pay off!" added Joe "The Goal" Gormley. </p>
      <p>Cliftonville are becoming a force under McLaughlin since he took over reigns at Solitude.Ronan Doherty’s goal vs Linfield in the Toals Co. Antrim Shield won the NIFWA’s Goal of The Month for October; a goal that was a true reflection of the style of play that McLaughlin is setting for The Reds.</p>

      <p>Cliftonville’s talisman Gormley, who finds out tomorrow if he will beat Linfield’s Joel Cooper and Coleraine’s Ben Doherty to the NIFWA’s Player of the Month for October says the nomination came as a surprise.<br/>Gormley added: “Of course it’s good to be up there, and if people want me to win it I’ll be more than happy.”<br/>“If I’m honest, I was surprised when I received the nomination.<br/>“I was surprised as I didn’t think I deserved it, I’d have given it to Richard Brush!<br/>“He’s been super and the backline along with him deserve a lot of credit.” Added Gormley, who sang the praises of his goalkeeper.<br/>Cliftonville ‘keeper Richard Brush has been hailed as “England’s number one” by the Solitude faithful, with Brush managing to keep a clean sheet in the league for the whole month of October.<br/>He goes up against a ‘Point side who have only managed one goal in their last six league outings.</p>
