      <p> </p>
      <p>She said: "It was the worst day of my life and today is the second worst as it brings it all back.</p>
      <p>"Fortunately I have a new partner who is being tremendously supportive and I have my kids to keep me going.</p>
      <p>"But, day to day it is still hard, it is hard just to go out of the house, to look in the mirror. Most of the time I am confined to the house."</p>
      <p>After the attack, Teresa moved away from Edinburgh.</p>
      <p>The man is described as a 5ft 11in tall, aged early twenties and of slim build.</p>
      <p>He was wearing a dark-coloured tracksuit, a grey top with the hood pulled up, dark gloves and trainers with light reflective sections.</p>
      <p>His face was covered.</p>

      <p>"If anyone knows anything then they must come forward. I am scarred for life and coming forward with information could prevent someone else suffering as I have. It may even prevent someone losing their life," Teresa added.</p>
      <p>According to the police, the man got in a grey Ford Fiesta with false number plates showing the registration number BN65 LFV.</p>
      <p>The car was seen at around 9.45pm travelling north in Drum Street with its lights off.</p>
      <p>It then went down Gilmerton Road, into Glenallan Drive and was driven into Inch Park where it was set on fire.</p>
      <p>Two men were seen to run off towards Glenallan Drive.</p>
      <p>Detective Inspector Jonathan Pleasance said: "The attacker targeted Teresa at her front door while her young children were just a few feet away.</p>
      <p>"This serious assault resulted in life-changing injuries and also shocked the local community.</p>

      <p>"If you recognise the man described or saw the car, before or after the attack, please contact police immediately.</p>
      <p>"I am confident that there are people in the Gilmerton area who have information that can assist the inquiry and I would urge them to come forward."</p>
