      <p>It occurs to us that some people might be in places (work, baby shower, your own wedding) where they can’t immediately watch the trailer for <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/nicholas-cage/">Nic Cage</a> and <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/kelsey-grammer/">Kelsey Grammer</a>’s (seemingly erotic) thriller <i>Grand Isle</i>, so we’ll just answer all your questions here in the post. Yes, Nic Cage <i>does </i>star as a deranged husband seeking to pay a handsome young stranger $25,000 to murder his beautiful wife. Yes, his beautiful wife <i>is</i> simply too sensual and has too much chemistry with said HYS (handsome young stranger) for this to be a clear-cut murder-for-hire movie.</p>
      <p>Yes, Kelsey Grammer does, in fact, co-star as the detective tasked with solving a murder (but whose?!), and Nic Cage does absolutely laugh maniacally with blood streaming down his face while gesturing wildly with a gun. If that’s not enough to convince you to watch it, keep in mind that everyone in the film indulges in a thick, syrupy, <i>Con Air–</i>worthy Southern accent and, what’s more, Nic Cage gets a huge knife stabbed through his entire hand. <i>Grand Isle</i> karate kicks its way into theaters and VOD’s sternum on December 6.</p>
