      <p>DUTCH art-photographer Jan Voster's distinctive style came into being on travelling to the north west of Ireland in 1986.</p>
      <p>A profound bond developed into ‘an artistic connection he’d never experienced in any other country'.</p>
      <p>In 1988, on finding a book about the shut-down Londonderry &amp; Lough Swilly Railway line, he began researching Cashelnagor, the site of a former station.</p>
      <p>This led him to produce two series of black and white studies - <i>Where the Road Ends and the Hills Begin</i>, and <i>Back to Cashelnagor</i> - tracing the remains of the route from Derry to Burtonport.</p>
      <p>A photograph of Mount Errigal would later feature on Altan’s LP Another Sky.</p>

      <p>In 1994, <i>The Linen Homeland</i> presented images concentrating on the industrial heritage of the flax and engineering mills in Antrim, Armagh, Down and Tyrone.</p>
      <p>The photographs explored panoramic views of the mills featuring meticulous intimate architectural detail.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the topography of Derry, in his collection<i> A Maiden Still</i>, depicted the sectarian war-torn city. His photographs captured the past, present and expectant future leading up to the Good Friday Agreement.</p>

      <p>Voster also collaborated with Cathal Ó Searcaigh recording the life and landscape of Caiseal na gCorr, resulting in the exhibition <i>Landscape of Remembrance</i>, and with Pamela Brown for <i>The Eye of the Horse</i>, a photographic/poetry exhibition that toured Derry, Donegal and the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>Born in 1949 in Blaricum, Jan Voster grew up in Amsterdam where he studied photography.</p>
      <p>A former bass player with The Meteors and Oh Boy, he cited Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Tom Petty, Van Morrison, Nick Cave and Leonard Cohen among creative cohorts.</p>
      <p>He had a diverse taste in Irish music and enjoyed Mary Black concerts in the Netherlands but his prodigious creative flow based on his adopted country made him an honorary Irish artist.</p>
      <p>His work is not only a gift but a legacy to the people of Ireland whom he said ‘gave me their hospitality, friendship and love’.</p>
      <p>Jan Voster, who was Associate Professor of Photography at Utrecht Centre for the Arts, died on October 25 in Amsterdam after a long illness.</p>
