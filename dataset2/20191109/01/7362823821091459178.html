      <h1>OJ Simpson suing Las Vegas casino for defamation</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/oj-simpson-case">O.J. Simpson</a> is suing a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/vacation-destinations/las-vegas">Las Vegas</a> casino, alleging its staff defamed him when employees told <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/celebrity-news">TMZ</a> that the infamous <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl">NFL</a> Hall of Famer had been kicked out for being drunk and disruptive in November 2017.</p>
      <p>Simpson filed the lawsuit Thursday against Nevada Property 1 LLC, which owns the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas.</p>
      <p>He said he was never given a reason. The complaint said the employees' defamed Simpson by telling the celebrity news site he was being belligerent in the casino's Clique bar, breaking a glass and destroying property.</p>

      <p>The TMZ article “specifically states that ‘hotel staff tells TMZ’ was the basis for the report," the complaint said, according to The <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/crime/courts/o-j-simpson-files-lawsuit-against-las-vegas-hotel-1888215/">Las Vegas Review-Journal</a>.</p>
      <p>Simpson had gone to the Las Vegas Strip property on Nov. 8, 2017. A security guard said he was banned from the resort.</p>

      <p>A spokeswoman for the casino declined to comment.</p>
      <p>“To date, the Cosmopolitan has never issued any public rationale or reasoning for trespassing Simpson from the property, other than claiming it was ‘private’ property the night of the issuance of the trespass notice,” the complaint said.</p>
      <p>Simpson was administered a drug and alcohol test by a parole officer at his home the next day. Officials determined "the Cosmopolitan’s assertions against Simpson were false,” the complaint said.</p>

      <p>The incident allegedly occurred six weeks after Simpson was <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/o-j-simpson-freed-from-nevada-prison-after-9-years">released on parole</a> from a Nevada prison after serving almost nine years for armed robbery and assault with a weapon.</p>
