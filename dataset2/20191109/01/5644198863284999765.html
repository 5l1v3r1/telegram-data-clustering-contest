      <p>REUTERS: Celgene Corp's treatment for anemia in patients with beta thalassemia, a rare blood disorder, would be priced at US$3,441 for a 25-milligram vial of the drug, partner Acceleron Pharma Inc said.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the treatment, Reblozyl, on Friday. The drug was jointly developed by Acceleron and Celgene, which is being bought by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.</p>

      <p>A typical dose of Reblozyl consists of 1 mg of the drug for a kilogram of patient's weight. A 75 mg vial of Reblozyl will be available at a wholesale acquisition cost of US$10,323.53 per vial, Acceleron said.</p>
      <p>The drug is expected to be available a week following the approval. Acceleron will co-promote Reblozyl with Celgene in North America, while Celgene will be responsible for the drug's commercialization outside of North America.</p>
      <p>Bristol-Myers had announced in early January that it planned to buy Celgene for US$74 billion. This will make Reblozyl a part of the new company at a time when Celgene's flagship multiple myeloma drug, Revlimid, awaits loss of exclusivity starting 2022.</p>
      <p>Baird analyst Brian Skorney, who expects the drug to bring in US$1.7 billion in worldwide sales by 2027, said the drug is a nice product, but "won't be anything that has shock and awe value for Bristol".</p>
      <p>Beta thalassemia is an inherited disorder that reduces the production of hemoglobin in blood, which can lead to lack of oxygen in many parts of the body and anemia.</p>
      <p>Treatment for people with beta thalassemia often consists of lifelong regimens of chronic blood transfusions for survival and treatment for iron overload due to the transfusions.</p>
      <p>"Today's approval provides patients with a therapy that, for the first time, will help decrease the number of blood transfusions", the FDA said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Shares of Acceleron were up nearly 7per cent at US$43.3 in afternoon trade.</p>
      <p>(US$1 = 0.9074 euros)</p>
