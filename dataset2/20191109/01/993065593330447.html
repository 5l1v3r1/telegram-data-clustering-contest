      <p>BACK IN THE DAY</p>
      <p>The Irish News, November 9 2009: Ulster Club Senior Football Championship quarter-final: Kilcoo (Down) 0-13 St Eunan’s, Letterkenny (Donegal) 0-9</p>
      <p>The higher altitude of the Ulster Club championship wasn’t a problem for Down champions Kilcoo as they deservedly overcame off-colour Donegal champions St Eunan’s, Letterkenny with four points to spare at a sunny Pairc Esler yesterday afternoon.</p>
      <p>There were star turns in every Magpie jersey yesterday, but the real eye-catcher was the irrepressible Paul Devlin.</p>
      <p>Kilcoo’s classy playmaker notched a dazzling half dozen points and owns one of the finest left foots in club football that Down boss James McCartan must be perusing this winter.</p>
      <p>They may be lightweight, but Jim McCorry’s team is exceptionally resourceful.</p>
      <p>Attackers Donal and Barry Kane claimed a combined five points against a decidedly meek visiting defence, while warhorse Anthony Devlin was again the perfect foil.</p>
      <p>Throw in the impish work of former inter-county ace Conor Laverty and Martin McClean’s midfield raids and Kilcoo have a reasonable chance of upsetting Loup next week.</p>
      <p>Kilcoo: S Kane; N Branagan, N Morgan, N McEvoy; B O’Hanlon, Gerard McEvoy, S O’Hanlon; P Greenan, M McClean (0-1); D McEvoy, P Devlin (0-6, 45, 2 frees), C Laverty; B Kane (0-2), A Devlin (0-1), D Kane (0-3, frees).</p>

      <p>St Eunan’s, Letterkenny: D Martin; E Doherty, M Martin, D McClafferty; A McClafferty,CRyan, C Greene; J Haran, K Rafferty (0-1); M McGowan (0-1), C Dunne (0-5, 4 frees), R Wherrity; D McGinley, B Devenney (0-1), C Morrison.</p>
      <p>Subs: E Brennan for M Martin (40), R Kavanagh for C Morrison (43), C Sharkey (0-1) for D McGinley (49), B McDermott for E Brennan (59)</p>
