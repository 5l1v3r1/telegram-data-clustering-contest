      <p>A missing student at <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/georgia">Clark University Atlanta</a> was found dead Friday and authorities say her roommate and the roommate's boyfriend <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/homicide">will be charged in her death</a>.</p>
      <p>Atlanta police chief Erica Shields said the body of 21-year-old Alexis Crawford was found at a DeKalb County park, about 11 miles away from her off-campus apartment.</p>
      <p>"The case has come to one of the saddest conclusions possible and has been absolutely heartbreaking," Shields said. "To Alexis' family, our hearts go out to you. I am so truly sorry that we could not provide you with a better ending."</p>

      <p>Shields did not release details on the cause of Crawford's death and said investigators have not yet established a motive. However, she noted that Crawford filed a police report on Oct. 27 describing "unwanted kissing and touching" by 21-year-old Barron Brantley, the boyfriend of Crawford's roommate Jordyn Jones, also 21. Shields said investigators were securing arrest warrants for murder against both Brantley and Jones.</p>
      <p>The chief added that one of the two suspects led investigators to Crawford's body, but did not specify which one.</p>
      <p>Alexandria Crawford, Alexis' sister, told police she last heard from her on the night of Oct. 30. Alexis had texted Alexandria to ask: "What are you doing for the weekend?"  Her sister responded, "Nothing."</p>
      <p>Crawford was last seen in public that same day at a store along Ralph David Abernathy Boulevard in southwest Atlanta. Her family reported her missing two days later, on Nov. 1.</p>
