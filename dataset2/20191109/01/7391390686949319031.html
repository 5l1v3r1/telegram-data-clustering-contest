      <p>There's no denying <a href="https://positivepsychology.com/benefits-of-journaling/">the benefits of journaling</a> — it can potentially improve your mood, reduce anxiety, boost your memory, and bolster your overall sense of well-being. Some studies even suggest it can <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23804013">help wounds heal faster</a>. But staring at a blank page can be overwhelming — where to begin? This is where guided journals come in handy. The <a href="https://mellowed.com/guided-journals/">best guided journals</a> offer you simple prompts to self-reflect and get your creative juices flowing.</p>
      <p>When you start shopping around, you'll quickly see that there's no such thing as an "average guided journal." Some journals are sweet, while others are funny and sarcastic; some require pages of writing while others only ask for few sentences. Certain journals focus more on happiness and self-exploration, while others are designed for goal-setting and habit-formation. The prompts can range, too, asking you everything from intensely thought-provoking questions to simple things like, "What's your favorite color?"</p>
      <p>The journal that's best for you will depend on your personality and what you're hoping to get out of writing in it. To help you find the right one, I spent some time on Amazon looking for the most popular, well-liked options. Below, I've made a list of the <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/the-7-best-self-journals-2896598">best guided journals</a> out there, according to what reviewers have to say. I've include a wide variety of lengths, types, and styles.</p>

      <p><b>What fans say:</b> "The daily planners are where the magic happens.

In short, the journal asks you a different question each day of the year (things like, "What's your mission?" "What are you reading right now?" and "What are you looking forward to?") and when you hit 365 days, you start over. Over the years, you can compare how you are doing, what your life is like, and how your philosophies have grown or changed.</p>
      <p><b>What fans say: </b>"This December I will have finished filling this journal. I will cherish this book for a long time. It just so (happens) that I started out this journal lonely, depressed and heartsick.

I got to capture all those changes in my life in this journal!"</p>
