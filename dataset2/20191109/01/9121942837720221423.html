      <p>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — A local witness and the U.S. mission in Afghanistan say a joint U.S.-Afghan military convoy has confronted several civilian vehicles with flares, after a confrontation on the road.</p>
      <p>The U.S. forces statement says Saturday that American troops released flares as a deterrent after making several attempts to wave the drivers off the road, but didn’t aim at the vehicles.</p>
      <p>It said U.S. forces were trying to stop the vehicles from approaching the convoy in eastern Laghman province Friday night and didn’t see any damage immediately to the vehicles.</p>
      <p>Imad Dawran, a witness to the incident, says he was waiting for the convoy to pass, but sudden flare shots caused him minor injuries and hit his car.</p>
      <p>He says he saw at least two other vehicles on fire on the road.</p>
