      <h2>Wolves v Aston Villa | The two Midlands rivals meet at Molineux on Sunday looking for what will be a vital three points</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T06:00:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Husband, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/ben-husband/</a></address>
      <p>Wolverhampton Wanderers will be looking to make it seven matches unbeaten when they face Aston Villa on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Nuno Espirito Santo's men haven't tasted defeat since they were hammered by Chelsea back in September. <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> have drawn their last three though and will be looking to return to winning ways when they host Villa.</p>

      <p>Villa meanwhile have lost two on the spin, including a heartbreaking 2-1 defeat to Liverpool last time out.</p>
      <p>The two Midlands rivals are separated by only two points and will both be looking to move away from the relegation zone and towards the top half.</p>
      <p>Dean Smith's men got the better of a much changed Wolves side in the Carabao Cup last month, but can exact some revenge in front of the Sky cameras.</p>
      <p>We took a look on social media and popular fans' forum <a href="https://www.molineuxmix.co.uk/forum/index.php?threads%2Fv-villa-predictions.214647%2F">Molineux Mix,</a> to get a flavour of how the old gold faithful are feeling:</p>

      <p><b>WonderWolf: </b>Got to be winning this one. A derby for sure but still it's against a relatively weak PL team. Progression truly for us is all about being able to deliver wins in situations where it is reasonably expected. Watford are the only 'weak' team we have managed to get 3 points off and it really isn't good enough.</p>
      <p><b>TiptonWolves: </b>1-1. They take the lead. We finish strong. This happened before?</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><b>Summer_Wolf: </b>Despite our recent draw fests.. got a good feeling about Sunday. Villa won't come and sit in, Dean Smith will be arrogant enough to think he can come here and play open and try to outplay us, and we'll pick them off. 3-1 win</p>
      <p><b>@Lem_WWFC: </b>Also let’s get the place absolutely rocking Sunday. Villa fans and players will be up for it and so should we</p>
      <p><b>WolfHeart: </b>We’re better and at home. It should be a win. Anything else would be a disappointment. Another draw it will do my swede in.</p>
      <p><b>Tojo the grass: </b>A feisty encounter resulting in a hard-fought 2-1 win to us, maybe</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><b>Incognito: </b>It's our 3rd best local derby, maybe even 4th if you say Stoke are #3, but a derby nonetheless. So normally expect it to be tight. Happy with a win by the odd goal. But think we will be well up for this on and off the pitch, so predicting 3-0 to the old gold n black. All together now</p>
      <p><b>@WolvesTruth: </b>We may have only scored 2 in the last 2 games but least we’ve bagged 45 shots in the process! Whatever happens Nuno. Keep Dendoncker at the back and let Moutinho and Neves do their thing against Minnows like Villa</p>
