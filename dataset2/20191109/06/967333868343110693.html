      <blockquote>Local media posted footage with a burning building in the vicinity of the mass rally that hit the central part of Santiago earlier in the day. The building was reportedly looted before it was set on fire.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>â€‹At least 1 firefighter was reportedly hurt extinguishing the blaze. Local authorities are estimating the damage inflicted to the university, founded in 1987.</blockquote>
      <p>Earlier on Friday, thousands of Chileans <a href="https://sputniknews.com/latam/201911011077202959-dios-mio-state-department-accuses-russian-trolls-of-meddling-in-chile-protests/">gathered for another rally</a> in the centre of Santiago.</p>
      <p>The rallies, which began in October, were caused by a spike in transportation costs. They subsequently led to larger protests against economic and social policies and <a href="https://sputniknews.com/analysis/201910291077173192-protests-in-ecuador-chile-and-bolivia-have-different-causes-but-one-root-brazilian-scholar/">resulted in unrest</a> primarily due to the heavy-handed response of police, according to reports.</p>
      <p>The situation led to the cancellation of an APEC summit and the COP25 climate forum, which were planned to be hosted by Santiago.</p>
      <p>Moreover, CONMEBOL organizers were <a href="https://sputniknews.com/latam/201911061077232860-conmebol-moves-finals-venue-to-lima-due-to-unrest-in-santiago/">forced to chose Lima</a> as host city for the football finals instead of Santiago.</p>
