      <p>WASHINGTON: The US would like to strengthen military cooperation with China, including repatriating the remains of American soldiers killed in the country during World War II, a senior Pentagon official said Friday (Nov 8).</p>
      <p>Defense Secretary Mark Esper, who is scheduled to visit Asia next week, will meet with his Chinese counterpart General Wei Fenghe on the sidelines of a meeting in Bangkok, said Randall Schriver, assistant secretary of defense for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs.</p>

      <p>"Our preference would be a more cooperative relationship with China," Schriver said.</p>
      <p>Esper will "ask for increased cooperation on the missing in action, primarily from the Second World War, where we have had off-again, on-again cooperation from the Chinese. And we'd like to see that resume in a more robust level."</p>
      <p>The United States fought alongside Chiang Kai-shek's nationalist army in southern China against Japan between 1942 and 1944, in what the US military dubbed the China-Burma-India theater.</p>
      <p>Esper also plans to raise violations of international sanctions that have been blamed on China, Schriver said.</p>
      <p>Washington accuses Beijing of illicitly providing oil to North Korea.</p>
      <p>During his tour, Esper will also visit Seoul, Manila and Hanoi.</p>
