      <p>Poor old Peely. First the big banana man was revealed in season 8 as a tender green fruit, not yet ripe enough to enjoy. By season 10, he was <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/this-is-not-what-the-inside-of-a-banana-looks-like/">this ungodly abomination, all bone and rot and... sin</a>. Now he's just being replaced by an edgy piece of meat.</p>
      <p>"The Brat" is what they're calling this new Fortnite skin, and he'll run you 1,200 V-Bucks. Like some sort of raccoon-meat-infused Malibu Stacy, he also comes with a new hat. If my eyes don't deceive me, he's got little sausage links for a necklace, which kind of feels like the anthropomorphic hotdog equivalent of wearing your dead enemies' fingers around your neck.</p>
      <p>And while Peely may have just been a banana with legs, the Brat is wearing skinny jeans. So it looks like James will need to write another essay on how a Fortnite skin has brought the existence of God into question yet again.</p>
