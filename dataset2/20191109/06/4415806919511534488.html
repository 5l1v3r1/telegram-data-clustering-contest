      <p>Former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger says he will talk to Bayern Munich over their vacant managerial post next week.</p>
      <p>The Bundesliga giants are in search of a new boss after they sacked Niko Kovac.</p>
      <p>Bayern’s executive board chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge had earlier said the club would not be pursuing Wenger, who has been out of work since he left Arsenal in 2018.</p>

      <p>But the former Gunners manager, 70, told Bein Sports: “We decided together we will talk next week because I’m in Doha until Sunday. This is the true story.</p>
      <p>“On Wednesday afternoon, Rummenigge called me. I could not answer and by politeness I called him back.</p>
      <p>“He was in his car going to the game against Olympiakos. We talked for four to five minutes maximum and he told me they had assigned Hans-Dieter Flick to be the coach – he will manage the next two games.</p>

      <p>“He [Rummenigge] asked me if I would be interested because they are looking for a coach. I told him I didn’t have any thoughts about it – it needs some time to have a think about it.”</p>
      <p>Frenchman Wenger won three Premier League titles and seven FA Cups during his 22-year spell in charge of Arsenal.</p>
      <p>Kovac was dismissed earlier this week following Bayern Munich’s 5-1 Bundesliga defeat against Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>The champions are fourth, four points behind leaders Borussia Monchengladbach after 10 games.</p>
