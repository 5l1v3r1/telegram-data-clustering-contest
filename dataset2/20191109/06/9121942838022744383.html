      <p>LONDON (AP) — Christian Pulisic scored his fifth goal in three Premier League games as Chelsea beat Crystal Palace 2-0 in the Premier League on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Palace’s defense survived a Chelsea onslaught in the first half — the Blues recording 11 shots to zero for Palace at the break — but Tammy Abraham broke the deadlock soon after.</p>
      <p>Abraham read the game well to beat Palace’s offside trap in the 52nd minute and met a backheel pass from Willian before shooting low for his 10th league goal of the season.</p>
      <p>Pulisic ensured Chelsea’s sixth consecutive league win in the 79th with a header when Michy Batshuayi’s shot was deflected and looped into the air.</p>
      <p>The American didn’t get a Premier League start from August until Oct. 26, when he took full advantage with a hat trick against Burnley. He followed up a week later with a goal against Watford.</p>
