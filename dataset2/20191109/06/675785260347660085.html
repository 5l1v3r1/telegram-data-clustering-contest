      <p>A man has achieved his dream of becoming a nurse after spending seven years in a refugee camp in Zambia.</p>
      <p>Justin Mwange, 40, fled from the war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo as a teenager with his family and lived in the refugee camp in abject poverty and deprivation.</p>
      <p>He was fuelled with the passion of helping the sick and vulnerable when he saw men, women and children dying on the road.</p>
      <p>He was determined to become a nurse despite the lack of formal education and financial support to further his studies.</p>
      <p>While he was at the refugee camp, he volunteered as a support worker with Medecins Sans Frontieres to help monitor patients with malnutrition.</p>

      <p>Justin's duty include monitoring patients' blood sugars, weight and distributing extra food parcels to children and vulnerable adults.</p>
      <p>Now, the 40-year-old has been nominated for a Chief Nursing Officer’s award by Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust after an impressive work placement at Hull Royal Infirmary and Castle Hill Hospital.</p>
      <p>He said: "Being in a refugee camp for seven years, I lost my self-esteem and self-confidence of achieving anything in my life.</p>
      <p>"I always see myself at the bottom of the queue and as the weakest link in anything.</p>
      <p>"Just being nominated for the award has raised my self-confidence and self-esteem."</p>
      <p>Justin arrived the UK with his wife Elizabeth Nyota in 2007 under a refugee resettlement programme. He took English classes in Hull and worked in a factory.</p>
      <p>He enrolled in the University of Hull and graduated as a social worker with a 2:1.</p>
      <p>But it was not until 2016 Justin enrolled in a nursing degree at the same school and has proven to be a valuable member of the nursing team.</p>

      <p>Knowing he is nominated for the national award, Justin said: "It was a long journey to get to where I am now and I am feeling very proud to fulfil my ambition of becoming a nurse.</p>
      <p>"My contribution, however little, if it makes a difference in people’s lives, will be a big achievement in my life. I just hope this new career works for me so that can put a smile of people’s faces."</p>
      <p>Vicky Needler, practice learning facilitator at the NHS Trust, said: "Justin is an outstanding individual who has overcome more than most people could ever imagine to achieve his aims of becoming a nurse.</p>
      <p>"He shows such compassion to patients and we are certain he will become an excellent nurse. We are very lucky to have had him with us throughout his studies and he is destined for a fantastic nursing career."</p>
