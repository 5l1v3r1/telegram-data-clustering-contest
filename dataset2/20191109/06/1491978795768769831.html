        <i>Fiye, 24, account executive, meets Shaun, 30, charity director</i>
      </p>
      <h3>Fiye on Shaun</h3>
      <p><b>What were you hoping for?</b><br/>To connect with someone, have a laugh and not spill any food down my white T.</p>
      <p><b>First impressions?</b><br/>Nice hair, very warm and engaging.</p>
      <p><b>What did you talk about?</b><br/>Work, how sweaty and hot we both get, Twitter, gym routines, being “woke” and the countryside.</p>
      <p><b>Any awkward moments?</b><br/>None that I can remember.</p>
      <p><b>Good table manners?</b><br/>Yes. Although we used our hands for certain dishes.</p>
      <p><b>Best thing about Shaun?</b><br/>He is very comfortable in his own skin and beams positivity.</p>
      <p><b>Would you introduce him to your friends?</b><br/>Yeah, sure.</p>
      <p><b>Describe Shaun in three words</b><br/>Passionate, confident, friendly.</p>
      <p><b>What do you think he made of you?</b><br/>Very smiley and talkative.</p>
      <p><b>Did you go on somewhere?</b><br/>To a local pub for a couple.</p>
      <p><b>And... did you kiss?</b><br/>No.</p>
      <p><b>If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?</b><br/>I would change the seats, as they were uncomfortable for a long period of time.</p>
      <p><b>Marks out of 10?</b><br/>7.</p>
      <p><b>Would you meet again?</b><br/>Sure, as friends. We exchanged numbers.</p>
      <h3>Shaun on Fiye</h3>
      <p><b>What were you hoping for?</b><br/>Good chat and lots of drinks.</p>
      <p><b>First impressions?</b><br/>Friendly and frazzled.</p>
      <p><b>What did you talk about?</b><br/>Our shared inability to return clothes, being a good ally, favourite pop icons, our different Uber etiquette, the pros and cons of different ages.</p>
      <p><b>Any awkward moments?</b><br/>He had a bit of tissue stuck to his face and I didn’t know how to tell him. I was surprised when he told me he read the Daily Mail sometimes. When he ordered a shandy. I didn’t know how to explain Karl Marx when Fiye said he hadn’t heard of him.</p>
      <p><b>Good table manners?</b><br/>Great. He always let me go first at the sharing plates.</p>
      <p><b>Best thing about Fiye?</b><br/>Funny. We had lots of laughs.</p>
      <p><b>Would you introduce him</b><b> to your friends?</b><br/>My pals are lovely, and I’m sure they would get on if it ever came up.</p>
      <p><b>Describe Fiye in three words</b><br/>Innocent, animated, inquisitive.</p>
      <p><b>What do you think he made of you?</b><br/>Probably a big drinker.</p>
      <p><b>Did you go on somewhere?</b><br/>We went to a cocktail bar. Fiye got a lemonade.</p>
      <p><b>And... did you kiss?</b><br/>Nope.</p>
      <p><b>If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?</b><br/>A date who I fancied.</p>
      <p><b>Marks out of 10?</b><br/>5.</p>
      <p><b>Would you meet again?</b><br/>I would stop for a chat if we ran into each other.</p>
