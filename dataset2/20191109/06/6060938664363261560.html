      <h1>Ashleigh Barty bagels Caroline Garcia as Australia level Fed Cup final</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T06:42:10+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 06:42</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>MELBOURNE: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Australia">Australia</a>'s ever-dependable Ashleigh Barty doled out the dreaded double-bagel to <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Caroline-Garcia">Caroline Garcia</a> to level the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Fed-Cup-final">Fed Cup final</a> against France at 1-1 after the opening day's singles at Perth Arena on Saturday.</p>
      <p>On a day of scorching heat, France struck the early blow when Kristina Mladenovic thrashed Ajla Tomljanovic 6-1 6-1 but the terrier-like Barty wrested back the momentum with her 6-0 6-0 humiliation of Garcia.</p>
      <p>World number one Barty will return on Sunday for the reverse singles and also the doubles, if required, as Australia bid for their first <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Fed-Cup">Fed Cup</a> title in 45 years.</p>
      <p>"I couldn't have asked for a more perfect match. That's probably the best <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/tennis">tennis</a> match I've ever played in my life," a thrilled Barty said courtside.</p>
      <p>"What a place to do it, this is incredible."</p>
      <p>Australia were wobbling after Tomljanovic's torrid Fed Cup debut match against Mladenovic, but a beaming Barty strode onto court cradling her niece in her arms and soaking up a huge ovation from the packed crowd.</p>
      <p>That was the last display of tenderness the French Open champion would produce until consoling Garcia with a hug at the net after scarcely 56 minutes of play.</p>
      <p>The crowd may hope for a tighter contest on Sunday and should get it if the confident Mladenovic meets Barty in the singles.</p>
      <p>The French number one came out swinging against rookie Tomljanovic, who was thrown into the cauldron by team captain Alicia Molik.</p>
      <p>With Fed Cup veteran Sam Stosur overlooked for the singles, Molik's gamble backfired as Croatia-born Tomljanovic, who only became eligible to represent Australia a month ago, promptly crumbled under pressure.</p>
      <p>Mladenovic broke her early in a barrage of power hitting and wrapped up the first set in 38 minutes with a fierce forehand return, delighting a rowdy pocket of blue-clad French fans.</p>
      <p>Tomljanovic's serve further disintegrated in the second set as Mladenovic roared to a 5-1 lead before sealing the match when Tomljanovic slapped a return well beyond the baseline.</p>
