      <h1>Zinedine Zidane reiterates desire to seal Kylian Mbappe transfer in PSG war of words</h1>
      <h2>Zidane said Mbappe 'dreamed' of playing for Real Madrid - which prompted backlash from PSG sporting director Leonardo criticised</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T06:41:29+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 06:41</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Zinedine Zidane has reiterated his desire to take Kylian Mbappe to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> after a war of words erupted with PSG chief Leonardo.</p>
      <p>Paris-Saint Germain's sporting director was incensed after Madrid boss Zidane remarked that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kylian-mbappe">Mbappe</a> dreamed of one day playing for Los Blancos.</p>
      <p>Leonardo urged Zidane to stop "destablising" Mbappe - but the Bernabeu legend has insisted he was only repeating remarks made by the 20-year-old <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/paris-saint-germain">PSG</a> star.</p>
      <p>"All I said was something that Kylian Mbappe had already said himself - that it was his dream to one day wear Real Madrid's white jersey," Zidane said during Friday's press conference to preview Real's La Liga game away to Eibar on Saturday.</p>
      <p>"That's all I said, and I'm saying it again today and I would repeat it again everyday. I have nothing more to say about Leonardo, I can say whatever I want."</p>

      <p>Leonardo had previously said: "Honestly, it's a bit irritating, it's annoying, it's not the first time this has happened.</p>
      <p>"I think that now is not the time to talk about this.</p>
      <p>"He is a player who has two-and-a-half years left on his contract with us, so to talk about what he wants, his 'dream', every time... if we can just stop this, pause this talk."</p>
      <p>PSG are in the process of offering Mbappe an improved deal, but the forward - who joined the club from Monaco for £121million last year - has emerged as the top target for La Liga giants Real.</p>

      <p>Speculation has also linked the France forward with a transfer swoop from Liverpool - but Reds boss Jurgen Klopp <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/jurgen-klopp-insists-absolutely-no-20843763">has been quick to quash such talk</a> .</p>
      <p>Klopp said: "Okay, from a sporting point of view, there are not a lot of reasons to not sign Mbappe, what a player he is.</p>
      <p>“But it is about the money of course. No chance. Absolutely no chance, sorry for killing that story.</p>
      <p>"I don't think there is a club in the world that can buy Kylian Mbappe from PSG. And we are involved in that too. We cannot do it, it is as easy as that.</p>
      <p>"We have nothing (more) to say about it to be honest, but [buying] this calibre of player is difficult."</p>
