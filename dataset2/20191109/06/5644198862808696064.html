      <p>SEATTLE: A U.S. judge on Friday said a former Twitter employee could be released on bond, with travel restrictions, while he awaits trial on U.S. charges of spying for Saudi Arabia.</p>
      <p>Seattle Magistrate Judge Paula McCandlis said her decision to grant Ahmad Abouammo, 41, bond would go into effect at 4:30 p.m. (7:30 p.m. ET), unless federal prosecutors lodged an appeal.</p>

      <p>If prosecutors appeal McCandlis' ruling, Abouammo will have to remain in detention until a district court judge considers her decision, defense lawyer Chris Black said.</p>
      <p>Abouammo was indicted on spying charges along with Ali Alzabarah, 35, another former Twitter employer, and Ahmed Almutairi, 30, who worked for the Saudi royal family, according to a complaint filed against the three on Wednesday.</p>
