      <p>BENGALURU: Moo­dy’s Inves­t­ors Service cut India’s ratings outlook to “negative” from “stable”, citing increasing risks that Asia’s third largest economy will grow at a slower pace than in the past, sending stock markets nearly 1 per cent lower at Friday’s close.</p>
      <p>However, Moody’s retained the country’s foreign and local currency ratings at ‘Baa2’.</p>
      <p>The cut in outlook partly reflected government and policy ineffectiveness in addressing economic weakness, which has led to an increase in debt burden, Moody’s said.</p>
      <p>The ratings agency also cut its outlook for 21 Indian companies, including State Bank of India, Indian Oil Corporation Ltd, Infosys Ltd and NTPC Ltd to “negative” from “stable”.</p>
      <p>India’s economy grew 5pc year-on-year between April and June, its weakest pace since 2013, which had prompted a slew of interest rate cuts by the central bank and forcing the government to cut corporate taxes sharply.</p>
      <p>Moody’s now expects a government deficit of 3.7pc of GDP in the fiscal year ending in March 2020, compared with a government target of 3.3pc.</p>
      <p>“The depth and duration of India’s growth slowdown, prolonged financial stress among rural households, weak job creation, and, more recently, a credit crunch among non-bank financial institutions have increased the probability of a more entrenched slowdown,” Moody’s said.</p>
      <p>The ratings agency said it does not expect the credit crunch among non-bank financial institutions to be resolved quickly.</p>
      <p>In response, the finance ministry said the economy’s fundamentals remained “quite robust”.</p>
      <p>“India continues to be among the fastest growing major economies in the world, India’s relative standing remains unaffected,” the ministry said in a statement.</p>
      <p>However, Indian bourses inched lower, with the broader Nifty 50 index closing down 0.86pc. The rupee weakened to 71.25 against the dollar by 1019 GMT, versus Thursday’s close of 70.965.</p>
