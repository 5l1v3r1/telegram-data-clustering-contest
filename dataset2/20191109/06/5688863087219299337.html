        <b>Rohit Sharma has admitted that he tried to go for six sixes in the 10th over bowled by Mosaddek Hossain after the first three went out of the park. Courtesy of Rohit’s Man-of-the-Match-winning 85 off 43 balls, India levelled the three-match T20I series against Bangladesh with an eight-wicket win.</b>
      </p>
      <p>He scored five hundreds at the World Cup, then smashed the Proteas attack all over the park as Test-match opener during the recently concluded Test series. Now, as stand-in captain, he has silenced the critics after their loss in the first match with a decimating performance in the second as the Men in Blue cruised home with more than four overs to spare chasing 153. </p>
      <p>"You don't need a huge body and muscles to hit big sixes. Even you (Chahal) can hit sixes. Power is not the only thing you need to hit sixes, you need timing as well. The ball should hit the middle of the bat and your head should be still. So there are a number of things you need in order to hit a six. When I hit three consecutive sixes, I tried to go for six maximums. But when I missed the fourth one, I decided I will take singles,” Rohit said, reported TOI.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, former India opener <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/virender_sehwag">Virender Sehwag</a> applauded consistent unmatched Rohit's scoring rate in the shortest format of the game.</p>
      <p>"Hitting 3-4 sixes in an over or scoring 80-90 runs off 45 balls is an art that I haven't even seen (Virat) Kohli pull off as regularly as Rohit (Sharma)," Sehwag told Cricbuzz.</p>
