      <p>Hey Hibees, Paul here. A warm GGTTHeckingbottom to you all.</p>
      <p>It’s always a humbling experience when a man is sacked from a job. It’s a time for learning lessons, taking responsibility and ultimately becoming better people. That’s why I’m here to tell you which people other than myself need to learn lessons, take responsibility and ultimately become better people.</p>
      <p>Let’s start with the media. On numerous occasions this season they’ve run negative headlines designed to make me look bad. Don’t believe me? Let’s take a look. How about “Hibs surrender two-goal lead at home against Ross County?” from the Daily Record on October 27th? What about the Sunday Mail, which went with ‘Hibs 2 v 5 Celtic’ on November 3rd?</p>
      <p>Even the BBC Sport website was at it, displaying a league table for everyone to see with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a> just one point off the bottom. I don’t care if you’re one of the greats like Sir Alex Ferguson or Paul Heckingbottom, that relentlessly negative reporting will make life difficult for any manager. Don’t even get me started on the guy operating the Easter Road scoreboard.</p>
      <p>How about <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/leeann-dempster">Leeann Dempster</a>? The Hibs chief executive has to take responsibility for appointing the sort of guy who can’t even motivate his side to hold onto a two-goal lead against Ross County. I mean, imagine expecting someone who’d been out of work for eight months since being sacked by Leeds United to succeed in the Hibs job. State of her.</p>
      <p>When I arrived at the club she said “With the structure we already have in place, Paul is the right person to embrace that support and take it to a new level”. I spent nine months doing just that, only to be dragged into her office on Monday morning and told that the Scottish Championship is not the new level she was referring to.</p>
      <p>Neil Lennon doesn’t get off scot-free either. He knew fine well what he was doing, leaving me with a decent squad so I could spend my first three months in the job getting a series of good results before ruining everything in the transfer window. He then had the cheek to allow Hibs to look dangerous for a few minutes in the second half at Hampden last Saturday, thereby underlining the fact that their catastrophic form this season is down to a lack of motivation as opposed to a lack of ability. The devious p***k.</p>
      <p>And what about those players? Time and again they’ve spent 90 minutes running about aimlessly. No passion, no shape, no cohesion, no hope. Someone in that dressing room should be motivating them and giving them clear, effective tactical instructions.</p>
      <p>Week after week I scanned the dressing room looking for a senior figure to provide that leadership, but all they did was stare at me. Eh, I’ve only been here nine months lads, how am I meant to know who gives the orders?</p>
      <p>Don’t think the fans are getting away without a mention. All the enthusiasm and optimism they carelessly displayed in the first three months of my reign was bound to go to my head. Seriously, “Hecky’s at the wheel”? They’d have been safer with Ant McPartlin.</p>
      <p>Then they had the cheek to suggest telling reporters that “We were trying to get the boys to relax but the whole stadium was anxious and that spread to the players” was somehow me deflecting blame and further alienating an already wary support. I preferred the specky lads that kept showing up with a guitar singing about ‘Some sh**e from Leith’. At least they were honest.</p>
      <p>Inanimate objects have to take their share of the blame too. The pen that wrote down “Kilmarnock defender Alex Bruce was giving an interview when <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/paul-heckingbottom">Heckingbottom</a> walked up, shouted ‘F***ing diver’ and walked off’. The dictaphone that recorded me saying “It didn’t help getting sworn at by the fourth official. I’d have knocked his teeth out if it was anywhere else…I could have picked any number of things why I was animated on the sidelines. One was that my back was killing me, one was yeah, he swore at me, another was what I was seeing on the pitch which I wasn’t happy with”.</p>
      <p>The water bottle that was carelessly placed in front of my boot and ended up hitting a fourth official, when I had only intended to kick the air in order to show my players how hard I wanted them to kick the ball into the goal.They all inflicted serious damage upon my reputation, through no fault of my own.</p>
      <p>Still, at times like this a man has to look into the mirror, and that’s exactly what I’ve done. Upon returning home on Monday after leaving Easter Road for the last time, I wrote ‘It’s everyone else’s fault Paul, not yours’ on my mirror. I’ve been looking into that mirror all week. It’s about time everyone else did too.</p>
