      <h2>Gemma Collins and James Argent celebrated their romance reunion by dancing the night away at a Boyzlife gig</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T14:08:17+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 14:08</time> by <a rel="author">Tiffany Wallis</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/gemma-collins">Gemma Collins</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/james-argent">James 'Arg' Argent</a> have been out celebrating their big romance reunion after reportedly getting back together during a trip to Dubai.</p>
      <p>The Towie stars are believed to be giving their relationship another go after jetting off on holiday together earlier this week to sort out their differences.</p>
      <p>It appears to have worked as the couple were seen enjoying a night out together at a Boyzlife gig on Yas Island on Friday evening.</p>
      <p>The on/off duo were spotted dancing as Brian McFadden, 39, and Keith Duffy, 45, performed tracks from their bands Westlife and Boyzone.</p>
      <p>Gemma, 38, appeared happy and loved-up in snaps that emerged from the concert.</p>
      <p>The GC documented the gig on her <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> page, posting snaps of Brian and Keith singing, and filming Arg to prove their updated relationship status.</p>

      <p>Earlier in the day, Gemma and Arg shared videos showing them riding dune buggies through the desert, with the former DOI star freaking out as they plunged down a steep hill.</p>
      <p>The couple's relationship has been on and off over the years, and they parted ways again in 2019 amid reports Arg had refused her request for him to go to rehab.</p>
      <p>But less than three weeks later, they've been spotted kissing and holding hands during a romantic trip to Dubai.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7655059/Gemma-Collins-James-Argent-jetting-Dubai-resolve-issues.html">MailOnline</a> reported they were seen being romantic at the £250-a-night Palazzo Versace Hotel in Dubai, with a source telling them they looked more "loved up than ever".</p>

      <p>It appeared the TOWIE love birds were done for good when Arg moved back to his mum's in October after Gemma called 999 amid concerns for his welfare when he failed to return her calls.</p>
      <p>Gemma, who feared Arg had overdosed, was said to have decided to call it off for good over after the scare.</p>
      <p>Speaking out about the incident recently, Arg told <a href="https://www.ok.co.uk/celebrity-news/james-argent-overdose-gemma-collins-20730191">OK! magazine</a> : "Gemma loves me to death. She was seriously concerned because she couldn’t get hold of me, which I understand.</p>
      <p>"I didn’t have my phone on me because it was charging downstairs. I have put her through a lot so I completely understand her worry.</p>
      <p>"She remembers what she’s been through in the past with me so she thought the worst."</p>

      <p>For seven years Gemma and Arg have kept fans on the edge of their seats with their constant breaking up and making up.</p>
      <p>In a recent episode of TOWIE, she admitted the stress of the split had derailed her three stone weight loss.</p>
      <p>She told her castmates: "I held on for two years and stood by someone and unfortunately it has not worked out and it is very sad."</p>
      <p>Mirror Online has contacted representatives for Gemma Collins and James Argent for comment.</p>
