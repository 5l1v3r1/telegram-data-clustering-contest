      <p><b>PROVIDENCE, R.I.Â (AP)</b> - A $25 million federal grant has been awarded to fix a highway bridge between Providence and East Providence.</p>
      <p>The state's congressional delegation announced the U.S. Department of Transportation grant for Rhode Island's Department of Transportation, bringing the federal commitment for the project to $56 million.</p>
      <p>It's expected to cost $70 million to rehabilitate the Washington Bridge's westbound span. The bridge, which was built in 1969, carries about 70,000 vehicles per day along Interstate 195.</p>
      <p>The delegation says the project would add more capacity, realign ramps and bring the bridge into a state of good repair.</p>
      <p>U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, says the much-needed improvements will make driving between Providence and the East Bay faster and safer, and prepare another major state artery for the 21st century economy.</p>
