      <p>THE new hotel being constructed on the site of the former Healy's Hotel in Pontoon is looking to have spa facilities.</p>
      <p>A planning application has been lodged by Pontoon Anglers Hotel Ltd. for a two-storey extension to the hotel plan previously granted, which includes spa treatment facilities, a hotel reception and two additional bedrooms.</p>
      <p>Documents submitted to Mayo County Council show the spa area will have a sauna, steam room, treatment rooms and relaxation area with a viewing terrace providing views of Lough Cullin. Adjacent to a valley woodland, its location and design offers privacy.</p>
      <p>The two additional bedrooms are on the first floor, bringing the number of bedrooms in the hotel to 18.</p>
      <p>The function room is extended to the north to provide table seating for 96 people.</p>
      <p>Work has taken place on the site and the old hotel is demolished.</p>
