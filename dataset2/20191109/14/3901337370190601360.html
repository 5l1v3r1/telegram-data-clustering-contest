      <p>The Gunners look to get their campaign back on track when they travel to the King Power Stadium to face in-form Leicester City on Saturday evening.</p>
      <p>However, former Arsenal striker Charlie Nicholas believes Matteo Guendouzi deserves to be dropped following his recent displays in the Gunners midfield.</p>
      <p>"Matteo Guendouzi is having a shocker and he is getting away with it due to Xhaka â€“ he needs to be taken out of the team," Nicholas told Sky Sports .</p>
      <p>"I would rather Unai Emery go with Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Lucas Torreira.</p>
      <p>"This is his (Torreira's) normal position, so let them be the legs in front of you."</p>
      <p>The former Scotland international feels Mesut Ozil and Nicolas Pepe should be starting in the attack.</p>
      <p>"Mesut Ozil played well (against Wolves ) so he should stay in the side ahead of Dani Ceballos, while bringing Nicolas Pepe in for the counter-attack."</p>
