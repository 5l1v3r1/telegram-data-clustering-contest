      <h2>Radboud University in Nijmegen has dug a 'purification grave' to help students reflect on the futility of their existence - and it's certainly different</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T14:55:07+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 14:55</time> by <a rel="author">Hannah Dodd, https://www.facebook.com/JournoDodd/</a></address>
      <p>A university has come up with an unusual method of helping its students to cope with exam stress - a meditation grave.</p>
      <p>Many have been trying to offer a range of alternative therapies to help students suffering from anxiety during exam periods.</p>
      <p>Some have offered therapy dog sessions, mindfulness meetings, and even designated quiet spaces, but no university has gone quite as far as Radboud University.</p>
      <p>Located in the Dutch city of Nijmegen, they recently went viral after an alumni revealed their unique approach to managing student stress- a grave.</p>
      <p>Yes, behind the student chapel is an open grave, and whilst it's not operational in the strictest sense of the word, people are dying to get in it.</p>

      <p>Inside the grave is an appropriate sign which says 'stay weird'.</p>
      <p>According to the students, the bizarre project is so popular they had to be put on a waiting list to secure an early grave.</p>
      <p>Student Sean McLaughlin said: "Me and my housemate were planning on going a week ago, a week and a half ago, and we found that there is a waiting list to actually get into the grave, so it's quite popular, so we didn't get the chance yet, but I plan to go sometime soon whenever I move up,"</p>

      <p>The 'purification grave', complete with a blanket and yoga mat, allows for comfortable, if a tad morbid, meditation.</p>
      <p>But according to the projects founder John Hacking, a member of staff at the student chapel, the grave is actually about making pupils appreciate their time on this earth a little more.</p>
      <p>John told Ruptly: "The end of life, death, is a taboo, difficult for students... death is very difficult to talk about, especially when you are 18, 19, 20 years old."</p>
      <p>Popularised by campus posters under the title "memento mori", Latin for "remember you will die", the grave experience can be booked for a minimum of 30 minutes and up to three hours.</p>
