      <h1>Trade unions warn of industrial action if RTÉ try to force pay cuts on staff</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T14:41:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 14:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>Trade unions at RTÉ are warning they will ballot members for industrial action if the broadcaster tries to force pay cuts and mandatory redundancies on staff.</p>
      <p>The National Union of Journalists said the state broadcaster faces "the full wrath of the trade union movement" if cuts are imposed by management.</p>
      <p>Staff representatives are being consulted about a three-year plan to slash €60m at RTÉ, which was announced this week.</p>
      <p>The broadcaster <a href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/rte-delayed-job-cut-announcement-because-of-death-of-gay-byrne-962390.html?utm_source=recirc&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=recirc">announced last week that it is seeking to reduce its workforce by 200 as one of a series of measures</a> to tackle its financial crisis and reduce projected costs by €60m over the next three years.</p>
      <p>Other notable measures include the closure of the existing studios in Limerick and the digital radio network, the sale of the RTÉ Guide and the closure of the Aertel service.</p>
      <p>Graham Macken, industrial official with Siptu, said striking remains an option.</p>
      <p>"There's a lot of negotiations and discussion to take place between now and then," said Mr Macken.</p>
      <p>"But I suppose to be very, very clear - we have stated that in the event that RTÉ attempt to impose pay cuts, that we certainly at this point can't rule out a ballot for industrial action.</p>
      <p>"Now, to be fair, that is not our preferred option.</p>
      <p>"But we need to reassure our members that it absolutely hasn't been taken off the table."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Green Party leader and former communications minister Eamon Ryan said the Government has failed to act to solve the funding crisis.</p>
      <p>"The problem here is not with the management or the board of RTÉ," said Mr Ryan.</p>
      <p>"The problem is that the funding model has collapsed and in those circumstances, the outgoings in the organisation are higher than the revenue. And things have to change."</p>
