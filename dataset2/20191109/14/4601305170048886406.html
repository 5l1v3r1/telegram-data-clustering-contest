      <p>Seattle-based novelty company <a href="http://mcphee.com/">Archie McPhee</a> is bringing out the weird with a new web series that is reminiscent of the low-budget cable shows of yore, and I mean that in the best way possible. The <i><a href="https://youtu.be/pNSCmJrOkvM">Archie McPhee Archives with Mr. Q</a></i> premiere starts with a guy in a leopard-print fez and a black sweatshirt emblazoned with a big white question mark ("Mr. Q") digging through cryptically-marked banker boxes in the company's warehouse. We're then shown each of the bizarro items he chose, one by one. Of course, he saves the best for last. Two words: Mutant. Farm.</p>
