      <h1>Grabban punishes Bogle howler as Nottingham Forest beat rivals Derby</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T14:54:43+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 14:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/09/PA%20Media" target="_blank">PA Media</a></address>
      <p>Lewis Grabban’s second-half goal ensured a narrow victory for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/nottinghamforest">Nottingham Forest</a> over local rivals Derby County at the City Ground. Forest’s top scorer won it in the 56th minute with his seventh goal of the season when he pounced on Jayden Bogle’s error to beat Kelle Roos to ensure manager, Sabri Lamouchi, was able to celebrate his 48th birthday in style.</p>
      <p>“Of course, it’s a great gift,” said Lamouchi. “It was an emotional game and for that reason, maybe the first half wasn’t the best.</p>
      <p>“The second half was much better. They made a big mistake and our striker, Grabbs, played a fantastic game one more time with great finishing, like killer finishing. That is what we wanted to see from him.”</p>
      <p>The hosts were the better side in the second half and deserved the win overall, although Jack Marriott should have earned a point for Derby when he scuffed a 76th-minute shot. Derby had started the brightest and could have taken the lead when Bogle surged forward from right-back and released Tom Lawrence, who drew a good save from Brice Samba.</p>
      <p>Derby had suffered an early blow when central defender Matt Clarke limped off five minutes after going down with what appeared to be a knee injury. Forest settled and tested Roos when Sammy Ameobi drove an effort at the Dutchman’s near post. The referee Darren England let plenty go with Bogle the first booked for clattering into Tiago Silva.</p>
      <p>England was also perhaps guilty of a case of mistaken identity when he booked Ben Watson after Ryan Yates had kicked the ball at an opponent after the whistle had gone. Ameobi then had Forest’s best effort of the first half when his stinging drive was pushed out by Roos in the final minute of the opening period.</p>
      <p>Forest were much the brighter side immediately after the break and took the lead soon after Ameobi had drilled a yard over. It came from Bogle’s terrible error when his square ball was picked off by Grabban, who slotted past Roos first time from the edge of the box.</p>
      <p>Derby manager, Phillip Cocu, felt his side deserved more. “In the big games but especially in games like this, a detail, a mistake can make the difference,” Cocu said. “Today, the mistake of Jayden cost us the result. That is tough because I think we played quite a good game.”</p>
