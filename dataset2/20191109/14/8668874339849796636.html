      <h1>Wasps wing apologises for behaviour in aftermath of red card</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T14:25:40+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 14:25</time> by <a rel="author">Ian Cameron</a></address>
      <p>Wasps wing <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/sale/players/paolo-odogwu/">Paolo Odogwu</a> has apologised for his behaviour in the aftermath of his red card for an accidental kick to the face of former Sale <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/sharks">Sharks</a> teammate Rohan Van Rensburg.</p>
      <p>The Du Preez brothers scored 22 of <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/wp/red-card-completes-wasps-night-of-misery-in-manchester/">Sale’s points as they secured a significant 28-18 </a><a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership">Gallagher Premiership</a> win over Wasps.</p>
      <p>However the late red card incident left a sour note to the encounter at the AJ Bell Stadium.</p>
      <p>Odogwu got his matching order for kicking Rohan Janse Van Rensburg flush in the face when fielding a high ball late in the second-half. The 22-year-old extended his foot out which then collided with Van Rensburg’s face.</p>
      <p>Despite the ugly optics of the incident, Odogwu appeared to laugh in derision at the referee’s decision to send him off. He admitted that his reaction wasn’t the best.</p>
      <p>“Tough one to take, challenge in the air wasn’t intentional but reaction wasn’t the best in the heat of the moment, it’s an emotional game sometimes gets the best of you.</p>

      <p>“Apologies to Rohan and @SaleSharksRugby hope you’re all good. Onwards and upwards.”</p>

      <p>Social meida inevitably got good mileage out of the incident; even the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/wasps">Wasps</a> Rugby account appeared shocked.</p>

      <p>The Coventry born winger – ironically renowned for his footwork – moved to Wasps from <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/sale">Sale</a> Sharks over the summer.</p>
      <p>In 2016, the explosive back ran in eight tries in just three Premiership Sevens group matches for Sale to top Christian Wade’s try-scoring record in the competition.</p>

      <p>During his first season in Manchester, he impressed across both the Premiership and Heineken Champions Cup, and has gone on to score seven tries in 29 first-team appearances for the Sharks.</p>
