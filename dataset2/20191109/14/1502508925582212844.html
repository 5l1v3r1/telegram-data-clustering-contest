      <p>Union Environment Minister Prakash <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/javadekar">Javadekar </a>on Saturday reviewed the steps being taken by Delhi and neighbouring states to combat air pollution, while urging their governments to stop blaming each other and start acting in synergy.</p>
      <p>The minister chaired a meeting to review air pollution mitigation efforts with senior officials of the governments of Delhi, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab, following the direction of the Supreme Court.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/javadekar">Javadekar </a>said the state governments have been urged to work together and not indulge in a blame game over the hazardous pollution levels in northern India.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/current-affairs-news-national-1150106.htm">national </a>capital's air quality remained "very poor" on Friday, days after hovering around "severe" and "severe plus" category.</p>
      <p>"There are local factors like waste burning, dust, industrial and vehicular pollution, which contribute to 70-80 per cent pollution. Everyone should think about how to reduce this pollution. I have appealed to them to not blame each other for it and work towards reducing pollution together," he said.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/javadekar">Javadekar </a>said that contribution of stubble burning in pollution has reduced.</p>
      <p>"The governments concerned have been directed to implement their action plans. Last week, stubble burning contributed to 30-35 per cent in pollution, it has now reduced to 3-4 per cent," he said.</p>
      <p>The meeting was also attended by Environment Secretary C K Mishra, CPCB chairman S P Singh Parihar and Delhi Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot.</p>
