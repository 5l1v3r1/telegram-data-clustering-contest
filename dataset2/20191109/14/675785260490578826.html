      <h2>The rivalry between KSI and Logan Paul has been brewing for the past year and they finally step into the ring again this weekend</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T14:00:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author">Aaron Flanagan, Martin Domin, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/aaron-flanagan/, https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfighting</a></address>
      <p>KSI and Logan Paul return to the ring tonight for their eagerly-awaited rematch as the social media rivals look to finally settle their beef.</p>
      <p>What began as a call out from KSI - real name Olajide William Olatunji - last year led to a sold-out first fight in Manchester which ended in a controversial draw.</p>
      <p>The pair had planned to rematch early in 2019 but negotiations dragged on until promoter Eddie Hearn stepped in.</p>
      <p>His involvement means both men have turned professional after being granted licences by the California State Athletic Commission,</p>
      <p>And tonight at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, they will dispense with the head guards and pull on 10oz gloves.</p>
      <p>They will also headline a show featuring world champions Billy Joe Saunders and Devin Haney.</p>
      <p>Here is everything you need to know about the fights...</p>
