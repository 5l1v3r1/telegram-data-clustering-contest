      <p>The frantic search for a missing 2-year-old girl lost in the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/oregon-teenager-senior-photos-killed-train-freight">Oregon</a> wilderness had a happy ending after the toddler was found safe by a woman on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/man-arrested-after-robbing-home-in-florida-on-horseback">horseback</a> and her dog.</p>
      <p>Tammy Stevens, 59, of Beaverton, was out for a ride Thursday morning with her <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/mini-horse-rides-san-francisco-bart">horse</a>, Bo, and her dogs, Wilson and Maddie, miniature Australian Shepherds, when she joined the search for the missing girl, according to Sgt. Marcus Mendoza, a spokesman for the Clackamas County Sheriff’s Office.</p>

      <p>He said as Stevens scouted terrain she described as steep and dangerous, she heard a child crying.</p>
      <p>“I said to Wilson, ‘Go get her and show me the way,’” Stevens said in a recorded interview with a deputy.</p>
      <p>“Wilson was climbing for her so I tied Bo up and then climbed up, really steep, super steep, about 70 feet and there she was,” she said. “She was pretty upset.”</p>

      <p>"Yeah, 15 minutes I could tolerate. After 15 minutes I started to lose it," Gayla told <a href="https://www.kptv.com/news/woman-on-horseback-loggers-help-find--year-old-girl/article_b5af7e10-0255-11ea-bc4c-23d0199b2881.html">Fox 12 Oregon</a>.</p>
