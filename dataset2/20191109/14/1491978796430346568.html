        <i>The Vogue supremo on being a hairdresser, growing up on the King’s Road and why fear is her default mode</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>‘Interesting’ is how </b>I’d describe my childhood. My parents were journalists [art critic <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/may/25/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries2">Milton Shulman</a> and author and broadcaster <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/jun/03/jubilee.monarchy4">Drusilla Beyfus</a>], so the house was always filled with books, talk, TV and newspapers. I realised early on that everything was a story.</p>
      <p><b>I’m proof that </b>parents can criticise a lot and not really harm you. Dad once told me I wouldn’t get a husband if I carried on arguing the way I did. But I knew I was loved and that makes the difference.</p>
      <p><b>Hairdressing was</b> my first career choice, but I lost interest in my teens and decided to go into the music business. I was fired from my first and only job in the industry. I tell people that being fired is one of the best things that can happen to you. The next thing is so much better.</p>
      <p><b>Fashion was on</b> my radar as a child in the 60s. We lived near the King’s Road. My first fashion purchase, aged 12, was an item of complete hideousness – a yellow maxi PVC mac – which I wore with pride.</p>
      <p><b>The criticism when</b> I became editor-in-chief of <i>Vogue</i> amused me. People said I was a words rather than a pictures person and that I had never worked in fashion before. My job was just to prove I could do it – which I did for 25 years. Michelle Obama was the one cover star I’d loved to have got. I tried… and failed.</p>
      <p><b>My default position</b> is fear. People are always surprised that I’m a lot more nervous than they think I am. Flying terrifies me; I’ve missed out on visiting so many countries. I’ve done every course possible and been hypnotised several times – which worked once. Now passion flower capsules help calm my anxiety.</p>
      <p><b>Getting older doesn’t </b>bother me. I’ve learned to value contentment rather than to focus on being happy, although it took me until I was well into my 50s.</p>
      <p><b>My biggest regret</b> is not being fluent in any other language. It puts me to shame when I go into a nail bar and the technicians can speak five languages.</p>
      <p><b>I lose my temper </b>when I get frustrated, but usually only with the people I love. I did lose my temper twice at <i>Vogue</i> – both times with men. Are Anna Wintour and I on each other’s Christmas card list? I don’t think either of us sends Christmas cards. So no.</p>
      <p><b>My relationship with</b> my son Sam [24, from her marriage to writer Paul Spike] is my greatest life achievement. He’s an art historian and we’re really close. I became a single mum during my time at <i>Vogue</i> and considered giving the job up so I could be around more when he was small. But when I weighed everything up it didn’t really make sense.</p>
