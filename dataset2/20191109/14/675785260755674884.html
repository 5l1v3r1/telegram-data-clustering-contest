      <p>Hollie Arnold is the best in the world - and the Grimsby girl wants to keep it that way when she defends her F46 Javelin title.</p>
      <p>The Briton goes in search of her fourth crown on Monday at the World Para-Athletics Championships in Dubai.</p>
      <p>And Arnold is ready to lay down a marker as she warms up for next summer’s Paralympics in Tokyo.</p>
      <p>Mirror Sport caught up with the 25-year-old Javelin superstar and discussed her plans for further world domination.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The world championships is on the horizon, how excited are you to be in Dubai?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I’m excited and nervous at the same time, I’m always going into major champs having that goal in mind. But it’s all about preparations, it’s all about going out there making sure you’re in the best shape and mental state that you can be in order to go out and perform on the day. I feel that if you’re not nervous, you’re not excited about it, you need that and to use it as nervous and positive energy to go out there and enjoy it; love what you do, and that’s exactly what I do.</p>

        <b>How has your preparation leading into Dubai been given the heat expectation, has it changed from previous championships?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Preparation has been obviously been slightly different with training because of the championships being so late. With the heat, we do some heat chamber work, even just sitting in high temperature, just to get used to your core temperatures, or you can do some training inside, and that just prepares you for the humidity side of it; because that is one of the worst things.</p>
      <p>I’m using Dubai as a steppingstone really for Tokyo because I feel Tokyo will be a lot worse. I’ve done it before when I’ve been in Rio. I’ve had lots of competitions in the heat, and I don’t like the heat, I find it really hard, but you’ve got to deal with it because everybody else in the competition is dealing with it themselves. It’s just trying to be as best prepared as possible.</p>
      <p>
        <b>As defending champion, what kind of confidence does that give you, or are there any nerves that come with the expectation of landing your fourth title?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yeah there’s massive pressure for me, for what I put on myself. I would like to go out there and defend that title and there is that extra pressure, but I’m going there with a clean mind and a clean slate, because this competition is brand new it doesn’t matter if you’re retaining champion or world champion, I’m going there to get that title, but I’m not going in there expecting to win because I have won it before. I’ve never been like that before and I think that if you have that mindset that sets you back in the fact that this is a clean slate, this competition could be anybody’s, but I want it to be mine.</p>

        <b>Who do you see as your main competition going into the championships?</b>
      </p>
      <p>My main competition is a girl with a name called Holly, same name as my own, she’s spelt with a ‘Y’ though. She’s my main competitor from New Zealand. She has a completely different season because they throw when we’re not and we throw when they’re not. It’s always been a head to head with me and Holly, but I also lack that competitiveness because we always bring out the best and the worst in each other, it’s the fighting that I love.</p>
      <p>
        <b>You already hold the world record, but you recently said that you plan to break it again in Dubai. How are you feeling about that now?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I am a little bit worried because previously, the New Zealand girl has taken the world record off of me this year. Even though it still feels like my world record because I haven’t actually competed head to head with her, I want to go there and get that back. There’s more pressure, but that’s also my pressure as well because I want to go there and take that back and have it as mine again.</p>

        <b>There is such a short turn around between the end of the World Championships and the Road to Tokyo. What will your training be like following the championships - will there be time to enjoy Christmas, for example, or will you be dedicated to Paralympics preparation?</b>
      </p>
      <p>My coach has allowed me a month off, but that doesn’t mean a whole month off, it means that I have to keep my body going, which means I go and play badminton or doing other things that are fun just to keep myself motivated, not fully focused on javelin for that amount of time.</p>
      <p>I think it’s really important having that time off, because mentally and physically I need that time, it’s been such a long season for me. It’s what I need going into Tokyo, if I didn’t have that time off I would be burnt out, I wouldn’t be ready for Tokyo.</p>
      <p>As soon as I’ve had my time off its straight back into training, straight back into preparations for Tokyo, I’m actually really excited for that. Me and my coach live in Loughborough, so after the championships I’ll be doing back to basics training and then be properly back into full training at the start of January.</p>
      <p>
        <b>You made your Paralympic debut aged just 14. How incredible was that and what has been the biggest change for you since then?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Nobody able bodied or disabled athlete got me into javelin, it was my brother. We went to a local competition called Startrack, where you could try any event. He picked up the javelin and I wanted to be the annoying little sister and copy him and to beat him because I was always competitive and that’s where my journey started.</p>
      <p>Just throwing the javelin down my local club then thrown into the deep end of Beijing at 14 was a massive impact on my maturity. With going into Tokyo and with it being my 4th Paralympics, it’s an amazing journey to take me from Beijing to Rio, where I actually won the Paralympics and that was a 10-year journey. It’s never been easy, there’s been a lot of ups and downs everything has been worth it.</p>

        <b>You’re dominating the sport and still only 25, what’s the goal for you post-Tokyo, could you see yourself competing at another two Games beyond that possibly?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I’m not going to give up after Tokyo, no way. I’ll be 26 in Tokyo, as long as I’m fit and healthy, I’m still loving the sport and still enjoy competing, I would want to carry on at least a couple more Paralympics.</p>
      <p>What do you enjoy the most about your sport and what would be the one thing that you change for the better?</p>
      <p>I love that I meet some amazing people you see so many different disabilities and their background and what they have to overcome as well, it’s a really nice community. When we go to the Paralympics there’s people we haven’t seen for years and years; we get to mix with the swimming, basketball and different things like that, and that’s so nice because you feel like one big team.</p>
      <p>The one thing I would change is if I was able to have more throwing events. It’s just the javelin in our disability class, if I was able to try shotput and discus, I’d love to give that a go.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How important has Nike been to you, and tell us how cool this Nike FlyEase shoe has been, and how are you using this in your training and what are the benefits to you?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Nike have been a massive help, I’m so privileged to be sponsored and to have the support of Nike with the kits and the equipment, like the new FlyEase shoe. They’re so perfect for training, it consumes as little time and energy as possible and allows me to get that perfect training in. You just zip, done and you’re off training, it’s the same with after training you can go home and recover and get ready for training the next day. They’re so fashionable and everybody wants them, and everybody thinks they’re amazing. It’s not just the disability side, it’s the ease for people.</p>
