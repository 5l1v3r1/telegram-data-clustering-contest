      <p>Germany on Saturday marked the 30th anniversary of the removal of the Berlin Wall, a pivotal moment in the events that brought down Communism in Eastern Europe.</p>
      <p>Leaders from Germany, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic attended a ceremony at Bernauer Strasse — where one of the last parts of the Berlin Wall remains — before placing roses in gaps in the once-fearsome barrier that divided the city for 28 years.</p>
      <p>The leaders stood beside a memorial that paid tribute to protesters in East Germany and neighbouring Warsaw Pact countries who took to the streets demanding freedom and democracy, and to then-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of reforms.</p>
      <p>Light installations, concerts and public debates were planned throughout the city and other parts of Germany to mark the fall of the Wall, including a concert at Berlin's Brandenburg Gate.</p>
