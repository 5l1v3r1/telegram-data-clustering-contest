      <p>Over on Blender Artists, we just added an Events calendar to Blender Artists to create a central place where you can find all upcoming things like meetups, workshops, conferences, challenges, etc! Feel free to add your upcoming events there to share them with the community.</p>
      <p>I'm still figuring out the best way to promote these events on BlenderNation - either by a weekly post (like every Saturday or so), or by integrating a widget on the front page. What's your preference?</p>
