      <p>Cape Town - Former Proteas skipper <b>Graeme Smith</b> is in the running to be South Africa's first full-time Director of Cricket, a position created in the aftermath of the recent Cricket World Cup.</p>
      <p>The Proteas won three matches, lost five and shared a washout with the West Indies, ending in seventh position in the 10-team tournament in England earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Subsequently, head coach Ottis Gibson and team manager Mohammed Moosajeeâ€™s tenures were not renewed.</p>
      <p>Smith, 38, confirmed to the <b>Cricinfo <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/28039648/graeme-smith-south-africa-first-director-cricket">website</a></b> that he was interviewed for the position this week.</p>
      <p>He is among at least two others in line for the job.</p>
      <p>Suspended interim Director of Cricket, <b>Corrie van Zyl</b>, and former national selector <b>Hussein Manack </b>were also interviewed.</p>
      <p>The position is expected to be filled before the end of the month.</p>
      <p>Smith played 117 Tests, 197 ODIs and 33 T20s for South Africa before retiring in March 2014.</p>
      <p>Smith, nowadays a highly respected commentator, tied the knot for the second time last weekend.</p>
