      <h1>New Mac Pro makes appearance in DJ Calvin Harris’ studio ahead of imminent release</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T14:07:20+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 14:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/chmiller44/" target="_blank">Chance Miller</a></address>
      <p>The Mac Pro release is growing more imminent day-by-day, with Apple teasing a “fall” release timeframe. Now, the Mac Pro has made an early appearance in the wild, courtesy of DJ and producer Calvin Harris.</p>
      <p>Harris took to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/calvinharris/?hl=en">Instagram</a> overnight to post a series of videos to his stories, seemingly designed to share a sneak peak at a new song. In the videos, however, we get a look a closer look at the new Mac Pro in the real world.</p>
      <p>The Mac Pro seen in Calvin Harris’ Instagram story is sitting on the floor next to his desk. It appears he wasn’t lucky enough to receive a version with wheels. Those wheels will be optional when the Mac Pro is released, coming at an added cost.</p>
      <p>It’s likely that Apple shared the new Mac Pro with creative professionals sometime recently, giving them a chance to try the new machine before its public release.</p>
      <p>The new Mac Pro will start from $5999 with an 8-core Intel Xeon processor, 256 GB SSD, 32GB of RAM, and more. The new chassis will allow for the machine to be incredibly powerful for build-to-order configurations, featuring up to a 28-core CPU, 4 GPUs and 1.5 TB of RAM.</p>
      <p>In conjunction with the Mac Pro, Apple also announced the $6,000 Pro Display XDR – which we expect to be released at the same time.</p>
      <p>Last week, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/06/tomorrows-final-cut-pro-x-creative-summit-will-feature-surprises-from-the-apple-product-team/">the Final Cut Pro X Summit was held</a> at Apple Park. Prior to the start of the event, Apple teased that it would feature “surprises from the Apple product team.” The Final Cut Pro X Summit would be a smart place for Apple to provide hands-on time with the new Mac Pro.</p>
      <p>The Mac Pro <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/10/30/the-new-mac-pro-hits-the-fcc-ahead-of-launch/">recently gained FCC approval</a>, suggesting that its release is imminent. Apple has teased a ‘fall” release, so it has just over a month and a half to meet that goal.</p>
