      <h1>Trump denies report that he is working on Apprentice return</h1>

      <p>President Trump said that he has not spoken with <i>Apprentice </i>creator Mark Burnett about a potential return to reality TV after he leaves the White House.</p>
      <p>Trump and Burnett have <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/the-apprentice-white-house-trump-and-mark-burnett-in-talks-for-post-presidency-tv-show">reportedly spoken to each over</a> the phone on a number of occasions since Trump won the 2016 election and have pitched potential TV projects to each other, although Trump took to Twitter on Saturday to refute that.</p>
      <p>“Fake News is reporting that I am talking to Mark Burnett about doing a big show, perhaps The Apprentice, after the presidency, which I would assume they mean in 5 years. This is not true, never had such a conversation, don’t even have time to think about it. False reporting!” Trump said.</p>

      <p>One of the proposed iterations for the show was politically themed and titled <i>The Apprentice: White House</i>.</p>
      <p>“There have been several discussions between Burnett and Trump about <i>The Apprentice: White House</i>,” someone with knowledge of the discussions said. “It is something Burnett thinks could be a money-spinner, and Trump is very keen on doing.”</p>
      <p>NBC ended its relationship with Trump in 2015 while he was running for president.</p>
