      <p>Tourists in Kunming, China have filmed an unusual carp that appears to have a "human face" - and quite a creepy one, too!</p>
      <p>The carp amazed the crowd with the peculiar pattern on its head - two black dots resembling eyes and two vertical stripes that look like nostrils. The overall result made the "face" look quite ominous and plain scary.</p>
      <p>However, the fish simply swam to the shore to find some food, with no ill intent and probably absolutely unaware of its macabre look.</p>
