      <h2>Steven Augustine is fighting for his life in hospital, unable to communicate with his family and friends after the horror incident in New York</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T14:53:54+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 14:53</time> by <a rel="author">Danya Bazaraa, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/danya-bazaraa/</a></address>
      <p>A dad-of-two was left paralysed with half a skull and a 'sunken brain' after a horrific attack on his way home from work.</p>
      <p>Steven Augustine, 32, was attacked in New York by Charles Miles who was jailed for only two and a half months.</p>
      <p>Miles received a misdemeanour charge after pleading guilty to assault and served just 72 days of his 10 month sentence at Ulster County Jail, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Steven has been in hospital fighting for his life in New Jersey since the incident in May 2018 - and will need further surgery.</p>
      <p>He doesn't respond to anything, his mum says, describing him as being in a vegetative state.</p>

      <p>A gofundme page set up for his medical treatment says: "Steve's sons will never go fishing with their daddy again.</p>
      <p>"They will never feel his arms around them when they get hurt."</p>
      <p>It adds: "It wasn't only Steve's life that changed forever. It's all the people who love him whose lives changed forever.</p>
      <p>"We have no justice. We have no peace."</p>

      <p>The left side of Steven's skull had to be removed after it was shattered during the assault.</p>
      <p>Now he needs a special plastic skull to protect his brain as he suffers from sunken brain syndrome – a rare complication after a craniectomy, a procedure to remove part of his skull.</p>
      <p>His heartbroken mum Donna told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10305159/dad-paralysed-half-skull-sunken-brain-brutal-attack-thug-two-months-in-jail/?utm_campaign=sunmainfacebook&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Facebook#Echobox=1573225532">The Sun</a> : "The left side of his head shattered along with multiple skull fractures throughout his head and face, and he has had bleeding on the brain.</p>

      <p>“Charles Miles was given a light sentence and I want justice for my son who is fighting every single day for his life."</p>
      <p>She described Stephen as a fun-loving guy and said he was always smiling.</p>
      <p>Donna added: "He loves his children and family more than anything in the world and to see him now, severely brain damaged, is devastating. I am heartbroken – my son is in a [vegetative] state."</p>

      <p>Doctors believed Steven's injuries appeared to be from blunt force trauma similar to a baseball bat - but a lawyer claims Miles punched Steven once causing him to fall backwards onto the ground.</p>
      <p>Ulster County District Attorney Holley Carnright said since Miles did not intend to cause serious physical harm to Augustine, they could not bring felony assault charges against him.</p>
      <p>But Steven's mum still struggles to believe her son's injuries could be a result of just one punch.</p>

      <p>She said he has been left only blinking to indicate 'yes' or 'no' and cries when he sees his two sons.</p>
      <p>Steven's family are hopeful that vital surgery - funded by a New York government agency - could help save his life.</p>
      <p>They continue to fundraise for his medical treatment on a gofundme page. To donate <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/funds-for-steven-augustine-and-his-sons">click here.</a></p>
