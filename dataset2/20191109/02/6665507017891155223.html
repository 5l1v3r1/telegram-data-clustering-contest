      </p>
      <p>The Supreme Court is going to pronounce its verdict in the historic and politically sensitive <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/ram-janmabhoomi/">Ram Janmbhoomi</a>-<a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/babri-masjid/">Babri Masjid</a> land dispute case of <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/ayodhya/">Ayodhya</a> at 10:30 am today.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/narendra-Modi/">Narendra Modi </a>on Friday evening took to Twitter to appeal to the people of the country to maintain peace and harmony as the verdict is announced. </p>

      <p>Ayodhya<a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/ayodhya-verdict-ram-mandir-result_in_5dc3a69ce4b005513882968a?utm_hp_ref=in-ayodhya"> has been under complete lockdown</a> since last month in anticipation of the verdict. Reports earlier this week had said that 12,000 security personnel had been deployed in Ayodhya district, while 16,000 volunteers were appointed by the UP police to keep an eye on social media to ensure no “objectionable content” or rumours are spread. </p>
      <p>“Adequate forces have been provided to Ayodhya and all sensitive districts of the state in good measure. The force has been sufficiently strengthened in terms of CAPF and PAC companies,” Additional Director General of Police (Law and Order) PV Ramasastry told <i>PTI.</i></p>
      <p>Ramasastry said not only their number had been increased but the efficiency of the deployed forces was also being improved for the past two months by giving them better equipment and training.</p>
      <p>Apart from this, senior officers were also involved in planning, he said.</p>
      <p>When asked whether drone cameras will be used for monitoring purposes, Ramasastry said, “Drone cameras are being used in the preparatory phase so that the deployment of the forces can be planned correctly.”</p>
      <p>He said drone cameras would also be used to closely monitor vulnerable spots and rooftops to prevent the accumulation of stones.</p>
      <p>Because of the crucial nature of the case and the communal riots that ensued after the demolition of the Babri Masjid on 6 December 1992, political leaders cutting across party lines have appealed for peace. The riots, according to official numbers, had killed 2,000 people. </p>
      <p>On Friday night, Prime Minister <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/narendra-Modi/">Narendra Modi </a>urged all sections of people to maintain harmony, saying the verdict would not be a victory or defeat for anyone. He <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/ayodhya-verdict-modi-tells-ministers-to-avoid-making-unnecessary-statements-bjp-rss-caution-cadre_in_5dc37bdbe4b00551388276ff?utm_hp_ref=in-homepage">reportedly</a> also told his council of ministers to avoid making unnecessary statements on it.</p>

      <p>The Delhi Police has also asked its top officials to identify sensitive areas in the city for deployment of additional force, officials said. The police, <i>PTI </i>reported, has planned elaborate security arrangements. </p>
      <p>Clerics and priest across the country have asked people to maintain restraint. Lucknow Eidgah Maulana Khalid Rasheed Firangi Mahali told <i>PTI</i>, “We should all respect the judgment. We should exercise restraint and not hurt religious sentiments of any community.”</p>
      <p>He said an all-religious meeting was recently organised at the Islamic Centre here to discuss several aspects before the judgment.</p>
      <p>“The Ayodhya case is the biggest and most sensitive case of independent India. Hence, it is the responsibility of every citizen to honour the verdict and maintain peace,” Mahali said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, priest at the Dakshinmukhi Hanuman Mandir in Hazratganj Sarvesh Shukla said, “My only appeal to the people is to honour and respect the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case.”</p>
      <p>“I am confident that people of this country are quite mature, and they will accept the judgement delivered by the court,” he said.</p>
      <p>Fourteen appeals have been filed in the apex court against the 2010 Allahabad High Court judgment, delivered in four civil suits, that the 2.77-acre land in Ayodhya be partitioned equally among three parties ― the Sunni Waqf Board, the Nirmohi Akhara and Ram Lalla.</p>
