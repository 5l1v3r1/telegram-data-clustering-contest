      <h1>Barcelona shortlist three final candidates as Ernesto Valverde’s replacements</h1>

      <h3>Ernesto Valverde is under pressure and given how Barcelona have been performing recently, it’s difficult to see him in the dugout for long.</h3>
      <p>With Celta Vigo visiting the Camp Nou on Saturday evening for their La Liga clash versus Barcelona, all eyes would be on Ernesto Valverde to bring his team back into recovery after two winless matches. The pressure has been mounting on the 55 year old after his team lost and drew respectively versus Levante and Slavia Prague over the last week.</p>
      <p>Lionel Messi, Gerard Pique and Luis Suarez- who are arguably the most senior figures in the dressing room- had offered their support to the Barca head coach following the Anfield debacle in May, but there has been nothing said publicly by them and it has been thought that they are also on the same page as the fans, wanting Valverde to be sacked.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxsportsasia.com/football/la-liga/1196776/reports-barcelona-identify-three-tacticians-river-plate-marcelo-gallardo-ronald-koeman-ajax-erik-ten-hag-replace-ernesto-valverde-if-hes-given-the-sack/"><b>Fox Sports has reported</b></a> that the Catalans have finally narrowed down their list of Valverde’s replacement to three candidates- Erik ten Hag, Marcelo Gallardo and Ronald Koeman. The three managers have all been successful with their respective names and do know the gameplay of Barcelona, thanks to them employing a similar style with their own sides.</p>
      <p>Marcelo Gallardo, the River Plate boss, has led the Argentinian giants to ten trophies in his five years with them and would be open for a new challenge in Spain. He seems to be the favourite to take over at the Camp Nou, but the Blaugrana must reconsider before employing someone without experience and much knowhow of European football.</p>
      <p>Ajax Amsterdam boss Erik ten Hag has also been closely linked with the potential job vacancy at Barca. The Dutchman oversaw an incredible campaign for his side last year, leading them to the Champions League semi-final. Erik ten Hag would be a fabulous choice for the Catalans, but he has committed to Ajax Amsterdam until the end of this season.</p>
      <p>Ronald Koeman is by far the best choice because of his long relationship with Barcelona. The 56 year old spent six years playing at the Camp Nou and two more as assistant coach, so among the three candidates he is best aware of the lofty standards in Catalonia. However, Koeman is set to remain with the Netherlands’ national team until Euro 2020 ends.</p>
      <p>Celta Vigo are battling relegation, so they will obviously come into the fixture as second favourites, but they are always a formidable side and can spring a shock if they are having a good day. Barcelona have had more bad days than good ones recently, so they must remain wary of the threat posed by their Galician opponents for the weekend.</p>
      <p>Ernesto Valverde reportedly has been given time to weather the storm until December 18, when Real Madrid visit, but it is foreseeable of him getting the sack earlier as well if Barcelona don’t do well in their earlier fixtures, some prominent ones featuring away visits to Inter Milan and Atletico Madrid with Borussia Dortmund being hosted as well.</p>
      <p>Who do you think is best suited to take over the job at the Camp Nou?</p>
