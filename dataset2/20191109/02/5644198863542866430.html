      <p>Arkansas has decided to back the U.S&gt; Justice Department's decision to approve a merger of T-Mobile US and Sprint , the third and fourth largest U.S. wireless carriers.</p>
      <p>WASHINGTON: Arkansas has decided to back the U.S&gt; Justice Department's decision to approve a merger of T-Mobile US and Sprint , the third and fourth largest U.S. wireless carriers.</p>
      <p>With Arkansas, the Justice Department has nine states backing its settlement to approve the US$26 billion deal on condition that it divest assets to Dish Network Corp , the department said in a statement.</p>

      <p>New York, California and the attorneys general of 13 other states and Washington, D.C., are headed to court to fight the planned merger in a trial that is to begin on Dec. 9. Colorado and Mississippi have defected from that effort.</p>
      <p>With the expiration of the deal agreement last week, the companies are in talks to extend it. T-Mobile Chief Executive John Legere on Thursday declined to rule out requesting the US$26 billion price be reduced.</p>
