      <h1>Chris Waddle gives Leicester vs Arsenal prediction ahead of must-win clash for Gunners</h1>
      <h2>Former Tottenham star Waddle predicts a goalfest in Saturday's teatime kick-off which could prove pivotal in the top-four race</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T02:13:12+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 02:13</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Chris Waddle has predicted a goalfest in Saturday's Premier League showdown between <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> which could have a huge bearing on the race for the top four.</p>
      <p>Under-pressure Gunners boss Unai Emery <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/unai-emery-admits-leicester-trip-20842422">has admitted Saturday's clash is "a must-win"</a> for his side, who are currently in fifth place, six points behind third-placed Leicester.</p>
      <p>Arsenal have not won in their last three Premier League games, while Brendan Rodgers' Foxes won 2-0 at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> last time out on the back of their stunning 9-0 demolition of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> two weeks ago.</p>
      <p>Leicester also have the league's top scorer in Jamie Vardy, who has 10 from the first 11 games.</p>
      <p>Arsenal also have a potent attack led by Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette, but considering the Gunners' well documented problems in defence, former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> ace Chris Waddle expects plenty of goals in Saturday's teatime kick-off.</p>

      <p>"The Gunners have got issues defensively and Leicester have so many threats going forward that there will be chances, probably at both ends," Waddle told the <a href="https://www.racingpost.com/sport/">Racing Post</a> .</p>
      <p>"I love what Brendan Rodgers is doing at Leicester and can only see them carrying on their good work by beating Arsenal. Arsenal will give as good as they get, but I predict a 4-2 Leicester win.‚Äù</p>
      <p>A win for Arsenal would be a timely boost to their hopes of qualifying for next season's Champions League, putting them within three points of the top four, with rivals Tottenham and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> struggling.</p>

      <p>But three points for the Foxes would be a huge statement of intent from Rodgers' squad that they can upset the traditional big six this season and return to the Champions League.</p>
      <p>It would open up a nine-point gap over Arsenal, with fourth-placed <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> also having the chance to extend their advantage to six points when they host Crystal Palace earlier in the day.</p>
      <p>Rodgers has been touted as a potential successor to Emery in the Arsenal hotseat as pressure grows on the Gunners boss following his team's inconsistent form. The former Liverpool manager has also been linked with a future move to United.</p>
