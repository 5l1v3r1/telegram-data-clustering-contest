      <h1>Houston prosecutor fired after asking about crime victim's immigration status</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T02:25:05+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 02:25</time> by <a rel="author">Louis Casiano</a></address>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/texas">Houston</a> prosecutor was fired Friday after he allegedly refused to bring <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime">charges</a> against a man accused of attempted sexual assault because he believed the victim was living in the United States <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration/illegal-immigrants">illegally</a>.</p>
      <p>Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg fired John Denholm after he had been reassigned to a different part of the office pending an investigation of the Oct. 31 incident, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/08/us/houston-prosecutor-john-denholm.html?emc=rss&amp;partner=rss">The New York Times</a> reported.</p>
      <p>“It is wrong to ask about a victim’s immigration status; it is against our policy, and it won’t be tolerated,” Ogg said in a statement. “We treat everyone equally under the law, no matter how they came to be here.”</p>
      <p>Denholm had been with the office since January 2017 and is a retired Harris County Sheriff's deputy, <a href="https://www.fox26houston.com/news/district-attorney-fires-assistant-da-for-allegedly-asking-about-victims-immigration-status-refusing-to-bring-charges">KRIV-TV</a> reported. He was questioning an officer who was present inside a Houston jail when Karl Bonner, an inmate suspected of drunk driving, allegedly tried pulling another inmate closer while exposing himself in a holding cell.</p>

      <p>The inmate screamed for help and an officer told Bonner “to get his hand off the complainant and to pull his pants up."</p>
      <p>When Denholm spoke with the officer, he asked about the victim's immigration status, suspecting that if he was undocumented, he wouldn't come to court to testify, according to media reports.</p>
      <p>“The district attorney, out of nowhere, says, ‘Well, is the complainant illegal?’" Joe Gamaldi, president of the Houston Police Officers’ Union, told <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/11/08/john-denholm-houston-prosecutor-illegal-immigrant/">The Washington Post</a> on Thursday. "He goes, ‘Because if he’s illegal, I’m not taking the charge.'"</p>
      <p>Denholm's alleged actions were quickly condemned by immigration activists and law enforcement officials. Both groups demanded he be fired.</p>
      <p>"An attempted sexual assault is a sexual assault, and the assistant district attorney who failed to file charges for this crime shouldn’t be reassigned, he should be fired because he is a racist and menace to the Hispanic community,” said Domingo Garcia, the national president of League of United Latin American Citizens, a Latino advocacy group.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately, sadly, a member of the district attorney’s office was more interested in this person’s status in terms of their immigration status,” said Houston Police Chief Acevedo.</p>

      <p>On Twitter, the police union said: "Victims of attempted sexual assault should not have justice stolen from them because a high ranking DA wants to question their legal status."</p>
      <p>In an email to the Post, Denholm said he was “aware of who made the inflammatory allegations” and suggested the officer's narrative was untrustworthy, according to the Post.</p>

      <p>Aise from the Halloween incident, Denholm also butted heads with law enforcement over his reluctance to file criminal charges.</p>
      <p>“He historically has been challenging to law enforcement and refuses to accept solid charges,” Harris County Deputies Organization president David Cuevas told the <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/District-Attorney-fires-prosecutor-who-allegedly-14820891.php">Houston Chronicle</a>.</p>
