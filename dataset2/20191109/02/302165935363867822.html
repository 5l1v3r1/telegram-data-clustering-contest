      <p>LOS ANGELES, Nov 9 — Kanye West finally unveiled his new album “Jesus Is King” late last month, and has now released a music video for one of its tracks, Follow God, starring his father and himself.</p>
      <p>The video begins with West and his father, Ray West, walking around in the snow. In a voiceover, Ray asks, What does it really mean to follow God? and goes on to describe how Kanye and his siblings were scared the first time they walked in the snow. I said to them, ‘Instead of creating your own footprints, walk in the footprints that I already made.’ The pair then drive monster all-terrain vehicles around the rapper’s Wyoming ranch.</p>
      <p>“My dad came to visit me at one of our ranches in Cody, Wyoming”, West wrote in a blurb at the end of the video. “It took me 42 years to realise that my dad was my best friend. He asked me, ‘how many acres is this?’ I told him 4000. He replied with these three words: ‘A Black man?’ “</p>
      <p><i>Follow God </i>is the first song from “Jesus Is King” to receive a music video.</p>
      <p>The album debuted atop the Rolling Stone 200 Albums chart and the Billboard 200 albums chart last month, making it West’s ninth consecutive Billboard Number One album.</p>
