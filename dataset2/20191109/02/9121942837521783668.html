      <p>BEIRUT (AP) — Syria’s state news agency is reporting intense clashes between government forces and Turkish troops in the country’s north.</p>
      <p>SANA said Saturday’s clashes included heavy machine gun fire and occurred in the village of Um Shaifa near the town of Ras al-Ayn.</p>
      <p>Turkey invaded Syria’s northeast last month to push out Syrian Kurdish fighters near the border.</p>
      <p>The Kurdish groups called in Syrian government forces to halt Turkey’s advance.</p>
      <p>Syrian government forces have clashed since with Turkish troops and Turkey-backed opposition fighters. Moscow has brokered a shaky truce in northern Syria, but sporadic clashes have continued.</p>
      <p>Last week, Turkish forces captured 18 Syrian government soldiers in the area and set them free hours later following mediation by Russia.</p>
