      <h1>Kevin Smith Will Host a Crisis on Infinite Earths Aftershow</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T02:11:36+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 02:11</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Abbate</a></address>
      <p>Fans of Kevin Smith know how much he loves to talk, especially about comic book movies and TV shows. And next month, the filmmaker will put his gift of gab to good use just in time for The CW’s highly anticipated <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/arrowverse"><b>Arrowverse</b></a> crossover. Via <a href="https://comicbook.com/dc/2019/11/08/kevin-smith-crisis-infinite-earths-cw-aftershow/">ComicBook.com</a>, Smith will host two aftershows following key installments of the network’s <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/crisis-on-infinite-earths"><b>Crisis on Infinite Earths</b></a> event.</p>
      <p>These new shows will air after new episodes of <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/supergirl"><b>Supergirl</b></a> and <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/the-flash"><b>The Flash</b></a> on December 8 and December 10, respectively. Smith himself confirmed the news (as well as the <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/crisis-aftermath"><b>Crisis Aftermath</b></a> title) on <a href="https://twitter.com/ThatKevinSmith/status/1192932242697465856">Twitter</a> earlier today. You can check out his announcement below.</p>

      <p>The aftershows will most likely take cues from similar shows like <b>Talking Dead</b> on AMC. Smith will presumably chat with a handful of guests to dissect the latest <b>Crisis</b> episodes and speculate on how future installments might play out. After <b>The Flash</b>’s episode airs on December 10, viewers will have to wait one month before the crossover resumes with back-to-back hours of <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/arrow"><b>Arrow</b></a> and <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/legends-of-tomorrow"><b>Legends of Tomorrow</b></a> on January 14.</p>
      <p>Obviously, Smith has a special connection to the <b>Arrowverse</b>. The CW has previously invited him to direct his own episodes of <b>The Flash</b> and <b>Supergirl</b> on several occasions. He even cameoed in his “Null and Annoyed” episode of <b>The Flash</b>’s fourth season as Bob the Security Guard. Currently, Smith is traveling the country hosting screenings of his latest movie, <b>Jay &amp; Silent Bob Reboot</b>, which premiered last month.</p>
