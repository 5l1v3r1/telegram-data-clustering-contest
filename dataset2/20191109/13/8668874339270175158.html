      <p>Gloucester are facing the Londoners just four days after the club that has dominated English club rugby in recent times learned they have been fined £5.3million and deducted 35 points.</p>
      <p>Having lost last Saturday at Leicester, who were winless after the two opening rounds, Johan Ackermann knows emotion opposition are trouble.</p>
      <p>“It’s almost like with Leicester, you play them after two losses you know you are going to get a side that is going to be bang on it, and I think it is the same thing with Saracens,” <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/saracens-are-going-to-be-quite-like-a-bear-with-a-sore-head-we-have-to-match-that-johan-ackermann">Ackermann told <i>RugbyPass</i> ahead of the intriguing Saturday afternoon showdown</a> (kick-off 3.0pm).</p>

      <p>“In that sense, it is unfortunate that were play Saracens now because they are going to be quite emotional and well-motivated. Saying that, we have to control our standard.</p>
      <p>“We didn’t play well in the first three weeks consistently so for us, if we really want to compete in this competition or in any competition, we have to be able to play well on a weekly basis and it starts on Saturday against Sarries. Even though we know they are going to be quite like a bear with a sore head, we have to match that.”</p>
      <p>Gloucester make a half dozen changes to the side that started at Tigers. <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/gloucester/players/freddie-clarke/">Freddie Clarke</a> replaces <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/gloucester/players/ed-slater/">Ed Slater</a> in the second row, Slater having picked up a foot injury early on at Welford Road.

      <p>Meanwhile, Saracens’ <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens/players/joe-gray/">Joe Gray</a> will start for the first time this season in the Premiership. The 31-year-old has appeared twice as a replacement so far in 2018/19 and takes the No2 jersey for the trip to Kingsholm.</p>
      <p>Flanker <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens/players/calum-clark/">Calum Clark</a> also features in the pack after missing the last-gasp victory over London Irish, meaning academy graduate <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens/players/nick-isiekwe/">Nick Isiekwe</a> switches back to the second row.</p>
