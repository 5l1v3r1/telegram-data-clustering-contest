      <p>Photographer Robert Freeman, who helped define the image of The Beatles with some of the band’s best-known album covers, has died at the age of 82.</p>
      <p>A statement on The Beatles website announced Freeman’s death on Friday, but did not give a cause.</p>
      <p>The former photojournalist shot the black-and-white cover for the 1963 album With The Beatles, picturing the Fab Four’s faces in part-shadow. He also photographed the covers of Beatles For Sale, Help! and Rubber Soul.</p>
