      <p>The Dane County Regional Airport may not be where you'd expect an exhibit on a different form of mass transportation. Nevertheless, "Faces of Railroading: Railroading and the Making of Madison and Dane County" in the airport's Art Court takes viewers on a nostalgic trip. </p>
      <p>The photography collection includes the faces of several people who spent decades working on the local railroads — such as conductor Tom Burke, shown helping people board the last Milwaukee Road passenger train out of the Madison depot on April 30, 1971 (pictured left).</p>
      <p>That photo, and many others included in the exhibit, was taken by John Gruber, who founded the Center for Railroad Photography &amp; Art during his 35-year tenure in the University of Wisconsin–Madison's publications department. Gruber died on Oct. 9, 2018. The exhibit can be seen at the airport until Jan. 26, 2020.</p>
