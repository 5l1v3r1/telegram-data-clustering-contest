        <b>Kane Williamson is confident of returning to international cricket in the upcoming Test series against England after recovering from a hip niggle which ruled him out of Sri Lanka T20 series. Williamson has shared that the niggle is settling as he admitted that the return will be tough.</b>
      </p>
      <p>After having a spectacular World Cup in England earlier this year, Kiwi skipper <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/kane_williamson">Kane Williamson</a> has played only two matches since then owing to a hip niggle. Williamson has shared that the niggle is settling and he will recover in time to lead New Zealand in the Test series against England.</p>
      <p>The injury, which had ruled him out of the Sri Lanka T20 series, has led the management to rest him for the five match T20 series against England as well. Williamson has lost his touch as he has scored only 50 runs in four innings.</p>
      <p>"It's been an ongoing niggle, really. That comes at goes. It is settling, which is nice," he told Sky during New Zealand's defeat in the fourth T20I at Napier.</p>
      <p>"A lot of [the last few months] has been rehab to get the hip right. I had a four-dayer recently [he made 26 for Northern Districts in a Plunket Shield game in October] and there's a gap between this series and the first Test, so it's basically training going into it."</p>
      <p>The Kiwi skipper, who is deemed as one of the best in the business across formats, admitted that it will be tough to comeback after such a prolonged gap from international cricket but then again he said that it's all about the mindset. Williamson was spotted training with the New Zealand squad in Napier ahead of the T20I, rather than playing in the ongoing round of Plunket Shield fixtures.</p>
      <p>"A lot of it is mindset. So trying to get that right, trying to prepare as well as well as you can to give yourself the best chance," he added.</p>
      <p>The first game of that series will also be the inaugural Test match at Mount Maunganui, one of Williamson's home grounds when he plays for Northern Districts in domestic cricket.</p>
      <p>"[It's a] really exciting time for cricket in the Bay of Plenty," he said. "I know everyone there is looking forward to the occasion, and I know the guys are looking forward to some red-ball cricket as well.</p>
      <p>"[We're] looking forward to get involved in the Test matches, which'll be a really exciting opportunity for us, taking on a strong English side."</p>
