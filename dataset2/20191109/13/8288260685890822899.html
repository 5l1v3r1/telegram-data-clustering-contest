      <h1>This West Brom star hopes to hand Slaven Bilic another headache at Hull</h1>
      <h2>Albion defender Conor Townsend has had to wait patiently this season, after an injury disrupted beginning to the Baggies' start to the campaign - now he has a chance</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T13:55:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 13:55</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Chapman, https://www.facebook.com/josephchapmanBM/</a></address>
      <p>It took until the end of October for Conor Townsend to make his mark on the <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">West Brom</a> side this season.</p>
      <p>Townsend, who to date has only made 16 league appearances for the Baggies since joining the club from Scunthorpe United, replaced the struggling Nathan Ferguson in the meeting with Barnsley - picking up a point-earning assist - and then entered the fray when the teenager saw red against Charlton.</p>
      <p>Against Stoke, he made light work of wing-back Tommy Smith in a defensive sense and offered a support to left-sided winger Grady Diangana going forwards.</p>
      <p>Is now the time that Townsend is afforded the opportunity to make his first serious case of owning the left-back spot in Albion colours?</p>

      <h3>The competition</h3>
      <p>When Townsend was snapped up from then League 1 outfit Scunny, for a fee of around £750,000, the consensus was that he’d be arriving as cover for first-choice Gibbs.</p>
      <p>Gibbs, who Albion held onto, was enjoying himself under Darren Moore; he found the net once or twice and tended to spend more time in the opposing half than his own. This admittedly didn’t help Albion’s frailties at the back.</p>
      <p>So Townsend, who at 26 isn’t exactly a youngster, had to make do with cup appearances and run-outs from the bench here and there.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Fast forward to the beginning of this campaign - and the draw at Derby - sheer bad luck meant that, just as Gibbs also suffered an injury set-back, he was unavailable to take advantage.</p>
      <p>By the time he’d returned, he found Ferguson making the left-back spot his own.</p>
      <p>An academy star, who had grown up a centre-back and thrived at right-back, was now denying him his first significant run in the Albion side since he arrived more than 12 months earlier.</p>
      <p>Ferguson will be available to face Bristol City in the coming weeks - can Townsend have cemented his place in the side by then?</p>

      <h3>The fans’ thoughts</h3>
      <p><b>Joshua Dyer:</b> A player who I think went under the radar but was superb was Conor Townsend!!! Passing is great, attacks well, defends well! Adds a lot more dynamic on the left! Ferguson been class but Townsend suits this team a lot more with his forward running!</p>
      <p><b>Matt Rowley</b> : Townsend, Sawyers, Bartley, HRK, Livermore. Absolutely superb</p>
      <p><b>TalkWBA</b> : Townsend deserves a lot of credit. Rarely gave the ball away or was challenged defensively and made some good movement link up play with Diangana. Certainly stepped up to his calling</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><b>Arry Gill:</b> Townsend stepped up well in the couple of appearances he’s made, fair play</p>
      <p><b>Ricci Dunn</b> : Townsend half decent going forward but doesn’t look like he has a clue when having to defend</p>
      <p><b>Andrew Beech:</b> Nice to see Townsend given ago. He isn’t as pacy as Ferguson but he can cross a ball</p>

      <h3>What Townsend said</h3>
      <p>“I’ve been patient for the best part of two years now – at least 18 months. I have always been waiting for my chance and this is an opportunity now for me, definitely.</p>
      <p>“It’s a shame for Nathan because he’s been brilliant when he’s been in the team, and Gibbo (Gibbs) is still injured, which is a shame too, but it is a chance for me and hopefully I can take it and kick on and prove that I’m the one that should play there.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“When I first came here I was new to the league. I had played a lot of games at lower league level but it’s different when you step up, but I’m confident in my own ability. I know I’m good enough to be in this team.</p>
      <p>“With us fighting at the top end of the table I just want to keep doing that and keep on proving myself.”</p>
