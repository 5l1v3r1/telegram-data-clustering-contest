      <h1>Arsenal 'blocked' Granit Xhaka statement after his "f*** off" blast at fans</h1>
      <h2>Granit Xhaka cupped his ears and screamed "f*** off" at Arsenal fans before whipping off his shirt and storming down the tunnel in the x-rated incident. Four days later he issued a statement</h2>

      <p>Arsenal refused to release a statement from Granit Xhaka the day after his x-rated blast at fans - because the two parties couldn't agree on the wording.</p>
      <p>Switzerland international Xhaka reacted badly to Gunners fans sarcastically cheering and then booing him after he was substituted during the north London side's draw with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> .</p>
      <p>The midfielder gestured to the supporters, cupped his ears and screamed "f*** off" before whipping off his shirt and storming down the tunnel.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> fans, furious by their captain's action, were further angered by the lack of immediate apology.</p>

      <p>But the <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/newcastle-to-offer-granit-xhaka-exit-route-from-arsenal-x33t0lm2k?wgu=270525_54264_1573303446832_23916c1ae8&amp;wgexpiry=1581079446&amp;utm_source=planit&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_content=22278">Times</a> have explained that Xhaka's silence was not down to his own making, but instead he and the club could agree on what the statement should say.</p>
      <p>Instead it took four days before Xhaka, via Arsenal's media platforms, released a strongly worded response to the incident.</p>
      <p>In which he wrote about sick social media abuse he and his family had received before calling for future unity.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Xhaka wrote: "After taking some time to reflect on what happened on Sunday afternoon, I would like to give you an explanation rather than just a quick response.</p>

      <p>"The scenes that took place around my substitution have moved me deeply. I love this club and always give 100% on and off the pitch.</p>
      <p>"My feeling of not being understood by fans, and repeated abusive comments at matches and in social media over the last weeks and months have me deeply.</p>
      <p>"People have said things like "We will break your legs", "Kill your wife" and "Wish that your daughter gets cancer".</p>
      <p>"That has stirred me up and I reached boiling point when I felt the rejection in the stadium on Sunday.</p>

      <p>"In this situation, I let myself be carried away and reacted in a way that disrespected the group of fans that support our club, our team and myself with positive energy.</p>
      <p>"That has not been my intention and I'm sorry if that's what people thought.</p>
      <p>"My wish is that we get back to a place of mutual respect, remembering why we fell in love with this game in the first place.</p>
      <p>"Let's move forward positively together. Granit."</p>
      <p>Xhaka, who hasn't played since the incident, has had the Gunners armband taken off him with Unai Emery electing to make Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang his new permanent skipper.</p>
