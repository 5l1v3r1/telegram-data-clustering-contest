      <p>India's credo of unity in diversity was visible in its totality after the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/supreme-court">Supreme Court </a>verdict on the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ayodhya">Ayodhya </a>land dispute as all sections of the society accepted it with an open heart, Prime Minister <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/narendra-modi">Narendra Modi </a>said on Saturday, urging people to shun bitterness and negativity for the sake of a new India.</p>
      <p>PM reminded the citizens that it was on this day almost three decades ago, that the Berlin Wall fell and united East Germany and West Germany. And now the day would also be remembered in history for two key developments -- the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/supreme-court">Supreme Court </a>ruling in the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ayodhya">Ayodhya </a>land dispute, and the opening of the Kartarpur corridor. PM Modi also gave credit to Pakistan for Kartapur.</p>

      <p>He also expressed happiness that the five-judge bench of the top court was unanimous in its order.</p>
      <p>He said peace, unity and amity are essential for development of India and described November 9 as a day to forget any bitterness one may have. He said there is no place for fear, bitterness and negativity in new India.</p>
      <p>Settling a fractious issue that goes back more than a century, the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/supreme-court">Supreme Court </a>in a historic verdict on Saturday backed the construction of a Ram temple by a trust at the disputed site in Ayodhya, and ruled that an alternative five-acre plot must be found for a mosque in the Hindu holy town.</p>
