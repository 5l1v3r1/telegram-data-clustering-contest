      <p><b>COLUMBUS, OhioÂ (AP)</b> - Ohio's State Highway Patrol is reminding people to always use seatbelts.</p>
      <p>The patrol says more than 1,300 people not wearing seatbelts were killed in crashes in Ohio the past two years. The state's 2018 Observational Seatbelt Survey found only 85% of motorists in compliance with Ohio's seat belt law.</p>
      <p>Lt. Michael Akers commands the patrol's Columbus post. He says seatbelts dramatically increase the odds of surviving a crash while reducing injuries.</p>
      <p>The patrol says 121,019 people in Ohio were convicted of driving or riding in a passenger vehicle for not wearing a seatbelt last year.</p>
      <p>The patrol says troopers stopping motorists for other violations will enforce state law if they find people not wearing seatbelts.</p>
