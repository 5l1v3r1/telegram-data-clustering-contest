      <h2>Arsenal are winless in the Premier League since October 6 ahead of their trip to high-flying Leicester on Saturday afternoon - and Emery has a message for supporters</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T13:00:20+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">James Whaling, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/james-whaling/</a></address>
      <p>Unai Emery has hit out at Arsenal fans for being "unhelpful" during the Gunners' slow start to the season.</p>
      <p>The Gunners could end up nine points off the top-four pace if they are beaten by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> on Saturday and pressure is mounting on the Spaniard.</p>
      <p>Vitoria's late equaliser in the Europa League on Wednesday meant it is now four games since <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> last tasted victory, against the same opposition.</p>
      <p>They are winless in the Premier League since their 1-0 victory over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> on October 6 - and Emery has pleaded patience among the fan base.</p>

      <p>"I think, for the supporters, they have seen that their team needs more to improve to achieve the best results," he said. "I can and I want to say to them: they must have patience.</p>
      <p>"In some circumstances they did not help us but we are trying to achieve the best emotional balance with the players.</p>
      <p>"The Ozil circumstance with Kolasinac, the Koscielny circumstance. Remember that if he was here the captain would be Laurent Koscielny and that would give us no problem.</p>
      <p>"Then also, Xhakaâ€™s circumstance. But the team, inside, they are strong. The players are working very well and I think they have a big commitment to work every day and to progress and to keep improving."</p>
