      <p>The Brazilian winger had been heavily linked with an exit ahead of the 2018/2019 season when Mauricio Sarri took over from Antonio Conte, but eventually opted to remain at Stamford Bridge instead.</p>
      <p>Barcelona and Jose Mourinho's Manchester United were the teams linked with the Brazilian, who has now confirmed the Catalan giants were the only side to make a proper offer.</p>
      <p>“The only real official offer I had came from Barcelona, last year, after the World Cup," told DAZN series Saudade, as per Metro.</p>
      <p>“Barcelona indeed presented an offer to Chelsea but it was rejected.</p>
      <p>“That was the only actual time I had to discuss something like this with my family, although we really love it here (London). So there were several factors that helped us in staying.”</p>
