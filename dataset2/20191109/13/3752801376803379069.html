      <p>A man convicted of murder and rape has been given three life terms and another 305 years imprisonment in the Durban High Court.</p>
      <p>The sentence was handed to Sello November (29) on Friday, after he was found guilty of 13 charges, which included murder, rape, and robbery.</p>
      <p>"Sello terrorised the communities of KwaMashu and Avoca Hills from 2011 until 2013 before he moved to Gauteng to continue with his deeds," says Kwa-Zulu Natal police spokesperson Brigadier Jay Naicker.</p>
      <p>November targeted females and school children walking in the early hours of the morning, Naicker explains, and would pretend to be jogging before grabbing his victims from behind.</p>
      <p>"He would then choke and rape them before robbing them of their valuables. Most of them were raped while unconscious," Naicker says.</p>
      <p>He was arrested last year in Durban Central after he diverted from rape to card skimming</p>
      <p>"He was positively linked through DNA and as well as identification parades. He is due to return to Gauteng where he was wanted on three cases of rape, robbery and murder."</p>
      <p>His victims included two 12-year-old girls from KwaMashu and a 31-year-old woman, who was killed during the attack.</p>
      <p>November was handed life imprisonment for rape as well as 15 years imprisonment for robbery in both cases where the victims were minors.</p>
      <p>For the incident in which he killed the woman, he received life imprisonment for the murder, 10 years imprisonment for rape and 15 years imprisonment for robbery.</p>
      <p>In 10 additional cases he was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment each for rape and 15 years imprisonment each for robbery.</p>
