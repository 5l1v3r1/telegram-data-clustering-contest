      <p>Germany marked 30 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall on Saturday with a string of events commemorating what is one of the most defining moments in modern European history.</p>
      <p>The breaching of the hated wall on November 9, 1989, followed a peaceful and popular uprising across communist East Germany amid moves among nations in Soviet-controlled Central Europe to break away from Moscow and shift towards western-style democracies.</p>
      <p>About 200 events have been held over the last week in Berlin alone.</p>
      <p>This included footage beamed onto a building in central Berlin of the 155-kilometre-long wall being breached by thousands of East Germans streaming into the west, consequently ending the nation’s Cold War divide.</p>
      <p>Under the slogan `7 Days – 7 Locations,’ lectures, art installations, talks from witnesses, films and exhibitions have been held at the original Berlin locations of the revolution.</p>
      <p>Berlin’s historic Brandenburg Gate has been the setting for an art installation featuring around 30,000 ribbons with people’s wishes, hopes and memories, combined into a 150-metre long freedom cloud.</p>

      <p>To mark the actual day when the wall fell, German President, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, and Chancellor, Angela Merkel, are expected to attend a commemoration at the Berlin Wall Memorial.</p>
      <p>Under its musical director Daniel Barenboim, the Staatskapelle Orchestra is to perform Beethoven’s fifth symphony also known as the Schicksals-Sinfonie or destiny symphony at the Brandenburg Gate.</p>
