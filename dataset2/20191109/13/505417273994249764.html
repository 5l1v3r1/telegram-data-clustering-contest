        <b>Ireland U19 manager Tom Mohan has named his 20-man squad ahead of the European Qualifiers against Switzerland, Gibraltar and Austria.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Boys in Green will play three games in six days in Austria as they look to reach the he Elite Round of qualifiers with the finals being hosted in Northern Ireland next year.</p>
      <p>Mohan has selected Borussia Monchengladbach midfielder Conor Noss in a competitive squad for the first time while Brighton’s Matt Everitt comes into the squad after missing last month’s double header against Denmark.</p>

      <p>Preston’s Adam O’Reilly receives a call-up for the first time while Everton’s striker Tom Cannon is included again following his <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/thomas-cannon/leistungsdaten/spieler/669366">brilliant start to the season with The Toffees’ U18s.</a></p>
      <p>One player who misses out is Manchester United’s <a href="https://punditarena.com/football/oisinmcqueirns2758/harvey-neville-ireland/">Harvey Neville</a>, son of Phil, who had been involved in the previous squad against Denmark.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.fai.ie/ireland/news/mohan-names-under-19-squad-for-qualifiers-in-austria">Under-19 Head Coach Mohan said:</a> “We had the vast majority of this squad in for the games against Denmark four weeks ago which was very beneficial as they were strong opponents and it is exactly what you need going into an international competition.</p>
      <p>“We took an awful lot from those games, both positively and in areas where we know we need to improve. We also have in the squad a number of players who impressed with Andy Reid’s Under-18 side out in Sweden which is a boost for us.</p>

      <p>“A number of the boys who are still eligible for us have moved on to the U21s and done really well and likewise a number of the U21s are stepping up to the senior side which, looking at the bigger picture, is the ultimate long-term goal we set our players. But along the way we want to be successful as well. We have a technical team, with seven players from this summer’s Under-19 Championship squad involved and exciting players in the final third of the pitch.</p>
