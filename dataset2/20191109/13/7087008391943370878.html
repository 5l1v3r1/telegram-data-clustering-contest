      <h1>Peter Schiff: Bitcoin’s Price Will Never Reach $100,000</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T13:38:59+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 13:38</time> by <a rel="author">George Georgiev</a></address>
      <p>Peter Schiff, a popular economist and financial broker, as well as a recognized author, has said that Bitcoin’s price will never reach $100,000. He also stated that Bitcoin’s pump is “finally over” and warned for an incoming dump.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin’s Price Will Never Reach $100,000</h3>
      <p>It’s not uncommon to see quite a lot of predictions coming from a range of different people within and outside of the cryptocurrency community, especially when it comes to <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-chart-analysis/">Bitcoin’s price</a>. Some of them are optimistic, while others not so much.</p>
      <p>Peter Schiff, a popular economist, as well as a recognized author, recently said that Bitcoin’s price will never reach $100,000.</p>

      <p>His statement came in a thread where he warned about an incoming dump in the price, following its most recent surge.</p>
      <blockquote>“It looks like the Bitcoin pump is finally over. Get ready for the dump!” – said Shiff.</blockquote>
      <p>Indeed, there was a dump in Bitcoin’s price not long after his warning. As <i>Cryptopotato</i> <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/friday-crypto-market-watch-bitcoin-says-goodbye-to-9k-plunging-800-in-48-hours/">reported</a> yesterday, the price decreased from around $9,400 to $8600 in a matter of hours. This happened after Bitcoin tried to break the key support at the 200-days moving average a few times and failed.</p>
      <h3>Historically Bearish on Bitcoin</h3>
      <p>This recent bash of Schiff doesn’t really come as a surprise to people who are following the cryptocurrency scene. The economist is well-known for his negativity on the matter.</p>
      <p>Following Bitcoin’s surge a few days back when the price jumped to $10,350 from around $7,400 in less than 24 hours, Schiff <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterSchiff/status/1189248019524403200?s=20">said</a> that this is the work of “Bitcoin whales.”</p>
      <blockquote>“Bitcoin hodlers won’t sell as they believe they’ll get rich when #Bitcoin moons. Bitcoin whales get rich by selling now to realize their paper gains before a market crash wipes them out. The whales must make sure the hodlers don’t lose faith and cash out so that they can cash in!”</blockquote>
      <p>Naturally, one of the questions that he didn’t provide an answer for, was if this applies to all markets, as it most definitely sounds so.</p>
      <p>In any case, we have yet to see whether or not Schiff is right on Bitcoin. However, with around 18.03 million bitcoins currently circulating, a price of $100,000 would imply a total market capitalization of $1.8 trillion which is astronomic, compared to its current state.</p>
