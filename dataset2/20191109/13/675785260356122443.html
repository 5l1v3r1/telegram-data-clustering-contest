      <h2>Officials believe the rats may have been poisoned and are taking a "cautionary approach"</h2>

      <p>Hundreds of dead rats have washed up on a beach in New Zealand following heavy rain.</p>
      <p>The rats were seen on the Wesport shore following 24 hours of downpours.</p>
      <p>It is thought they may have been poisoned in a 1080 operation - the name given to the substance used in New Zealand to control populations of possums, rats, deer and rabbits.</p>
      <p>DOC Western South Island operations director Mark Davies confirmed to <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/117300105/hundreds-of-dead-rats-on-buller-beach-following-a-1080-drop">Stuff</a> there had been an aerial 1080 drop at Te Maruia in the Lewis Pass National Reserve recently.</p>
      <p>Te Maruia and Inangahua river catchment feeds into the Buller River and had a plague of rats treated with toxin a week ago, Davies said.</p>

      <p>However there are also reports of dead fish and birds washing up on the beach, which is not consistent with the way 1080 is understood to work.</p>
      <p>The poison operation was also more than 140km away from Westport's North Beach, where the rats washed up.</p>
      <p>"However, until we know otherwise, we have to presume the rats have been poisoned by 1080 and take a cautionary approach," he said.</p>
      <p>Samples have been taken but results are expected to take between 48 and 72 hours.</p>
      <p>Davies said aboutÂ 600 rat carcasses had been collected along about 3km of beach, and DOC staff would check the beach after high tides for the next couple of days.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, dog owners have been warned to keep their pets off the Westport while the beach is investigated.</p>
