      <h1>Arsenal player ratings from Leicester defeat as pressure piles on Unai Emery</h1>
      <h2>Brendan Rodgers' Leicester side sealed a deserved 2-0 Premier League victory over Arsenal as Jamie Vardy and James Maddison got on the target in the second half</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T19:19:32+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 19:19</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Dunn, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/andy-dunn/</a></address>
      <p>Jamie Vardy's 11th Premier League goal of the season and a James Maddison strike helped <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> secure a deserved victory over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> to pile the pressure on Unai Emery.</p>
      <p>The hosts were arguably the stronger of the two teams in the first half, displaying great attacking intent at the King Power, but were fortunate not to fall a goal down when Alexandre Lacazette missed a sitter.</p>
      <p>The Foxes continued to pile the pressure on after the restart, with Wilfred Ndidi hitting the woodwork for the hosts, before Arsenal's new permanent captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang saw a goal correctly ruled out for offside.</p>
      <p>And Brendan Rodgers' high-fliers finally got the goal their performance deserved when Vardy finished off a well-worked team goal to score goal No.11 of what has been a superb season so far.</p>
      <p>Seven minutes later and Maddison, recently called up to Gareth Southgate's England squad, doubled Leicester's lead when he collected Vardy's pass and fired him from the edge of the Gunners box.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Bernd Leno 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>No chance with goals but distribution could have been better.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Hector Bellerin 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>Still looks to be scratching his way back to form and pace.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Rob Holding 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>Brought the ball out well but a little rash on occasions.</p>

      <p>
        <b>David Luiz 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Read danger very well and one of the better distributors.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Calum Chambers 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>Never looked particularly comfortable and that was eventually exposed.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sead Kolasinac 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Strictly limited his attacking ambitions but fairly solid in main job.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Lucas Torreira 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>Caught in possession too many times and a little off the pace.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Matteo Guendouzi 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Usual combative self but chose wrong passing option too many times.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Mesut Ozil 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Deprived of possession, struggled to have any sort of impact.</p>
