      <h1>'Made an impact' - The three players dominating Birmingham City fans' thoughts - for very different reasons</h1>
      <h2>Blues 0-1 Fulham | Mitrovic's goal was the difference as BCFC were beaten at St Andrew's</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T19:13:19+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 19:13</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Husband, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/ben-husband/</a></address>
      <p>It was a tale of missed opportunities, refereeing errors and one big mistake as Birmingham City were beaten by Fulham at St Andrew's.</p>
      <p>Blues put in a valiant performance against the Cottagers but were left to rue missed chances when Aleksandar Mitrovic capitalised on a Lee Camp error to poke home.</p>

      <p>The Serbian scored after Camp dropped a cross right into the path of the striker, who didn't have to think twice about giving his side the lead.</p>
      <p>Blues boss Pep Clotet admitted he would speak to their goalkeeping coach in order to establish whether it was an error or simply him taking the wrong option.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>In more positive news, Jeremie Bela put in a bright performance on his debut only days after signing on the dotted line at the club.</p>
      <p>Jefferson Montero, who has endured an injury ravaged start to his spell, also enjoyed a particularly bright performance in a losing effort.</p>
      <p>They were three players dominating the chatter on social media following the game, highlighting the two attackers' good performances, whilst lamenting the crucial Camp error:</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><b>@RyanDeeney914:</b> A lively opening but a disappointing overall display. We have to learn how to mix the high press with game management. For now, it's another learning curve. The big positives were Bela and Montero. A start for the former at Huddersfield?</p>
      <p><b>@TR_90:</b> Bela looked good and Montero made an impact.</p>
      <p><b>@bcfcjames:</b> First 20 very lively but then totally faded out of the game until the last 20 Bela looks good and Montero has the beating of his man every time.</p>
      <p><b>@Everything BCFC:</b> Wasn’t expecting much today, Fulham have some top players. Same thing happened at Cardiff where we started well, zipped it about and created chances, but then took our foot off the gas. JCS looked tidy, Montero brilliant.</p>
      <p><b>@LeeAHinton95:</b> Refreshing to see us moving the ball quick and trying to play football. Bela &amp; Montero bright. It will come.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><b>@MaxBradley_:</b> I’d like to thank Camp for his services to the club but we need to move on. Weve stuck by him and given him plenty of opportunities. Some good displays but unfortunately too many clangers in that time. Frequent mistakes that have ultimately cost us points. Time for a change</p>
      <p><b>@KurtAustin:</b> Always stood behind Camp week after week but he needs to sort himself out, costing us too many results</p>
      <p><b>@RyanKilleen</b> : I’d rather have Lee Camp up front than in goal</p>
