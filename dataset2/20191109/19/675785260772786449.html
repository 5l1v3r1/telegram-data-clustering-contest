      <h2>Red-hot Jamie Vardy piled the pressure on Arsenal boss Unai Emery as the Leicester striker continued to haunt the Gunners</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T19:53:43+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 19:53</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal legend Tony Adams has slammed the club's recruitment policy and defended under-pressure Unai Emery after the struggling Gunners were well beaten by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> City on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>Foxes star Jamie Vardy scored his ninth goal in nine starts against the Gunners to inspire the Foxes to a 2-0 win and into second in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Vardy, the top flight's 11-goal leading scorer, also set up James Maddison's clincher as Emery's side slumped to a limp defeat at the King Power Stadium.</p>
      <p>But, rather than focus on Leicester's superb display, Adams highlighted the issues <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> are enduring both on and off the pitch.</p>

      <p>"I think it is easier to blame the manager. I don't think he is doing himself any favours at the moment, with the captaincy situation, for instance," he told Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>"Today, he got them organised but they just sat back and dropped so deep. The recruitment has been very poor for some years now.</p>
      <p>"You have got to have characters in there. There aren't any in the squad. It is difficult for him, he hasn't got the players. The manager must be pulling his hair out.</p>
      <p>"We came here expecting a good hiding and they got one.</p>

      <p>"I don't think those players go out on the pitch and believe they will keep a clean sheet and it is infectious."</p>
      <p>Alexandre Lacazette wasted Arsenal's best chance and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had a goal disallowed but the visitors were poor.</p>
      <p>The Gunners, winless in the Premier League for over a month, slipped eight points behind the top four with Emery's position under increasing scrutiny.</p>
      <p>Leicester now sit five points behind leaders <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> - who host <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> on Sunday - after a deserved fifth straight win.</p>
