      <p>Drivers have shelled out over £2million in fines on one bus lane.</p>
      <p>The 70-metre stretch in Lambeth, South London, is Britain’s most lucrative.</p>
      <p>It has stung 30,500 motorists with penalty charge notices of up to £130 since January 2018, the AA revealed.</p>
      <p>Its president Edmund King said: “Councils continue to hoover up fines on an industrial scale as drivers who make a single mistake on unfamiliar roads are targeted ruthlessly.”</p>
      <p>The AA accuse many councils of deliberately milking motorists by not marking their bus lanes properly.</p>

      <p>And they have ignored government advice to warn rather than fine first-time offenders.</p>
      <p>One driver successfully challenged his fine for using the 70m lane in Lambeth when a tribunal ruled signs were inadequate.</p>
      <p>Across England, councils are expected to make more than £52million this year from bus lane cameras – a 33 per cent increase from last year.</p>
      <p>London authorities are expected to make £28.5million this year, followed by Manchester with £5million, Essex on £1.8million and Reading on £1.7million.</p>
      <p>Others raking it in are: Ealing (£1.4million), Coventry and Lancashire (both on £1.3million) and Bristol, Kingston on Thames and Kirklees, all on £1.2million.</p>
      <p>Mr King added: “Councils outside London are lobbying central government to be given extended powers to enforce ‘moving traffic’ offences, such as yellow box junctions.</p>
      <p>"This can’t be allowed to happen while drivers are hunted for fines income. The guiding principle needs to be deterrence.”</p>
      <p>Lambeth council said: “The bus lane in Clapham Park Road is clearly marked and complies with all regulations and standards.”</p>
