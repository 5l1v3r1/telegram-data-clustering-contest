      <h2>Millions of people around the world will be tuning in to watch as KSI and Logan Paul settle their rivalry in the ring</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T19:00:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 19:00</time> by <a rel="author">Aaron Flanagan, Martin Domin, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/aaron-flanagan/, https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfighting</a></address>
      <p>KSI and Logan Paul will tonight look to establish themselves as the best YouTube boxer in the world when they clash in their rematch.</p>
      <p>The social media stars first met in the ring last August when they fought to a controversial draw at a sold-out Manchester Arena.</p>
      <p>The sequel has been a long time coming but the pair finally agreed terms earlier this year and were granted professional licences by the California State Athletic Commission.</p>
      <p>That means they will get rid of the head guards and pull on 10oz gloves for the second instalment at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>And there is plenty of star power on the undercard with world champions Billy Joe Saunders and Devin Haney in action.</p>
      <p>Here is everything you need to know about the fights...</p>
