      <h1>'Typical Hull' - The Slaven Bilic message that kept West Brom top</h1>
      <h2>Hull City 0-1 West Brom | A Jake Livermore first half strike was enough to earn all three points at the KCOM and keep them top of the league</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T19:40:01+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 19:40</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Husband, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/ben-husband/</a></address>
      <p>Slaven Bilic has revealed he told his <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">West Bromwich Albion</a> players they needed to dig in to earn all three points against Hull City.</p>
      <p>Jake Livermore gave Albion the lead in the first half, with a scorching strike from distance.</p>
      <p>And they were made to work hard to hold onto that advantage, with the home side piling on the pressure in the second half. But Bilic, who saw his side stay at the top of the Championship, was pleased with his side's willingness to adapt their game and win in what was a difficult situation.</p>
      <p>“That’s the aim [to win in any situation]. I said to the guys at half time. We had to manage it more maturely. Don’t get me wrong, Hull is a kind of team who, unless they risk totally, you have to give them something for them to hurt you.</p>

      <p>“You have to lose the ball, and not be in the positions that allows them to make the chances that Grosicki had. In the first half we gave them a couple of those situations, but at the same time we were able to pass the ball very fluidly in the first half.</p>
      <p>“We had to continue that, because you can’t defend and sit back for 45 minutes, but we had to manage the game a bit better. We were going to lose the ball, so we had to have enough numbers at the back to be ready to stop them from hurting us. That’s what we did in the second half.”</p>

      <p>Bilic added: “It was a good game, it was a game with two teams who came into this game with a confidence.</p>
      <p>“Both teams had a great run in the last few games. We expected it from them. They’re very good on transitions, the way they had their chance from Grosicki - it’s typical Hull. We didn’t manage to get our full-back from the other side inside.</p>
      <p>“Overall it was a very good performance from us, the only thing that was missing was that second goal.”</p>
