      <p>THE GAA Central Council is to meet with officers of the Mayo GAA County Board over an ongoing controversy.</p>
      <p>The Croke Park-based ruling body is concerned over the impasse between the board and the Mayo International GAA Supporters Club.</p>
      <p>THE club, headed by millionaire businessman Tim O'Leary, is withholding €250,000 raised at a function in New York last May after citing concerns over governance issues.</p>
      <p>The purpose of the meeting, to be attended by the GAA's director general Tom Ryan, is 'to scope the full extent of the issue' and seek to find a solution.</p>
      <p>The Connacht GAA Council will also be represented at the meeting.</p>
