      <p><b>MAGNOLIA, OhioÂ (AP)</b> - A mayoral election in a small Ohio village could once again be decided by a coin toss.</p>
      <p>The Canton Repository reports candidates Travis Boyd and Grant Downes each received 127 votes during Tuesday's election in Magnolia, which straddles Stark and Carroll counties.</p>
      <p>A coin toss will determine the winner if Boyd and Downes remain tied after election results are certified in two weeks.</p>
      <p>That's how outgoing Mayor Robert Leach got the job, winning a coin toss in 1979. Leach chose not to seek re-election after running unopposed for 9 consecutive terms.</p>
      <p>A 1923 Peace silver dollar is believed to have been used to break election ties in Stark County since the early 1940s.</p>
      <p>Magnolia's population is just under 1,000. It's roughly 73 miles (117 kilometers) south of Cleveland.</p>
