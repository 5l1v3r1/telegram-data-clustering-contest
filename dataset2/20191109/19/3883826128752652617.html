        <b>Leicester and Chelsea both won in the Premier League on Saturday as they maintained their challenge for a top-four finish, while Tottenham dropped more points.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Leicester moved into second on goal difference, five points behind Liverpool, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50271775">with a 2-0 win over Arsenal</a> in the late game. Jamie Vardy and James Maddison scored as the Foxes recorded a fourth consecutive league win.</p>
      <p>Chelsea are third after they <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50271772">beat Crystal Palace 2-0</a> - their sixth successive league win - thanks to goals from Tammy Abraham and Christian Pulisic.</p>
      <p>Spurs were <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50271774">held 1-1 at home by Sheffield United,</a> meaning Mauricio Pochettino's side have failed to win any of their past five league games.</p>
      <p>Son Heung-min put Spurs in front but George Baldock equalised for the Blades, who are now fifth in the table.</p>
      <p>Everton increased the pressure on Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl with a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50271771">2-1 victory at St Mary's,</a> as Tom Davies and Richarlison scored either side of Danny Ings' equaliser.</p>
      <p>The Saints, who stay 19th, were booed off at full-time as some home fans threw their scarves on to the pitch.</p>
      <p>West Ham's winless run extended to seven games in all competitions as they were beaten <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50271770">3-0 at Burnley</a>, and they are just two places above the relegation zone.</p>
      <p>Newcastle are up to 11th after coming from behind to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50271773">beat Bournemouth 2-1</a> through goals from DeAndre Yedlin and Ciaran Clark.</p>
