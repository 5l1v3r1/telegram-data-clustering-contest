      <p>Ukraine's military forces and the Russian-backed rebels they've been fighting since 2014 began withdrawing from the village of Petrivske in the disputed eastern Donbass region on Saturday.</p>
      <p>It's one of a series of measures that could pave the way for a peace summit between Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France.</p>
      <p>Relations between Kiev and Moscow collapsed after Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014. That prompted Western sanctions.</p>
      <p>Both sides accuse each other of violating a ceasefire that was agreed in the Belarus capital Minsk in 2015.</p>
      <p>It's not the first time that the two parties have pulled troops out with the help of the OSCE monitoring mission.</p>
      <p>Relations between Ukraine and Russia collapsed following Moscow's annexation of the Crimean peninsula in 2014, which prompted Western sanctions.</p>
      <p>Ukraine says after the Crimea annexation Russia engineered quasi-separatist uprisings across a belt of eastern Ukraine that escalated into a full-scale conflict, something Moscow denies.</p>
      <p>Two so-called People's Republics, unrecognised by either Kiev or Moscow, have formed in the Donbass region.</p>
      <p>According to the UN the fighting in the eastern region has killed more than 13,000 people in five years.</p>
