      <p>Romance was in the air this week as more than 300 companies and individuals offered to assist with planning the wedding of the highly publicised KFC proposal couple.</p>
      <p>The wedding, which has been dubbed South Africa’s very own fast-food fairy tale by the BBC, has attracted top brands such as Audi, Total, Nedbank and Amstel as sponsors for Hector Kansi and Nonhlanhla Soldaat’s wedding, honeymoon and married life.</p>
      <p>A video clip of Kansi proposing to his partner at a KFC in the Vaal went viral this week and led to South Africans working together to plan the perfect wedding.</p>
      <p>In the recording, which was shared on Twitter by Kateka Malobola, Mkansi and Soldaat are about to dig into their KFC meals but before that can happen, he gets down on one knee and pops the question.</p>

      <p>Once the video made waves online on Thursday, KFC tweeted about it, calling for the public to help find the couple and by Friday morning online sleuths had tracked them down.</p>
      <p>It wasn’t long before South Africans started pledging their services for the couple’s wedding.</p>
      <p>KFC was the first to pledge its support, followed by an offer from MTV Base to provide deejays for the reception. Celebrity chef Lesego Semenya committing to make a signature wedding cake, while travel site kulula.com pledged to gift the couple with a honeymoon in Cape Town.</p>
      <p>Other generous people pledged to sponsor the bride’s dress, pay for the groom’s suit and donate rings of up to R45 000.</p>
      <p>Musicians including Zakes Bantwini, Donald and DJ PH will be making sure that guests are entertained.</p>
