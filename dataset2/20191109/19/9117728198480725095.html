      <p><i>“There are many [races I’d like to do]. I like off-roading as well, but the off-roading I’ve been doing is very different to the Dakar, a lot more aggressive with jumps and things. I’ll race the Baja 1000 with some friends at the end of this year, on the same weekend as DTM and SUPER GT in Fuji, which I’m very excited about,"</i> Button told <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/lemans/news/button-definitely-return-2020-hypercar/4592624/?filters%5Bdriver%5D%5B0%5D%5Btitle%5D=Jenson+Button&amp;filters%5Bdriver%5D%5B0%5D%5Bvalue%5D=13&amp;nrt=102">Motorsport.com</a>. </p>
      <p><i>“In the future, I will definitely race in Le Mans again. I’m very excited about the new regulations and in the future, it will be a great series, WEC. If I did it next year, it would be to get used to Le Mans again and just gain more experience. Probably in LMP2, because that’s the pace the hypercar is supposed to be,"</i> Button added. </p>
