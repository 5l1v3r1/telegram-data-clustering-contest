      <p>Red-hot Jame Vardy piled the pressure on Arsenal boss Unai Emery as the Leicester striker continued to haunt the Gunners.</p>
      <p>The forward scored his ninth goal in nine starts against the Gunners to inspire the Foxes to a 2-0 win and into second in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Vardy, the top flight’s 11-goal leading scorer, also set up James Maddison’s clincher as Emery’s side slumped to a limp defeat at the King Power Stadium.</p>

      <p>Alexandre Lacazette wasted Arsenal’s best chance and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had a goal disallowed but the visitors were poor.</p>
      <p>The Gunners, winless in the Premier League for over a month, slipped eight points behind the top four with Emery’s position under increasing scrutiny.</p>
      <p>Leicester now sit five points behind leaders Liverpool – who host Manchester City on Sunday – after a deserved fifth straight win.</p>
      <p>Trailing Leicester by six points before kick-off the Gunners desperately needed the win and Lacazette should have put them ahead after 14 minutes.</p>
      <p>The hosts started brightly but Arsenal created the first opening when Hector Bellerin crossed for Aubameyang.</p>
      <p>He failed to find the finish and the ball rolled for Lacazette, who could only fire wide from six yards.</p>

      <p>It allowed the Gunners to briefly look dangerous and Lacazette’s weak shot was gathered by Kasper Schmeichel.</p>
      <p>They had contained any early Leicester threat but were guilty of poor distribution as Emery’s men tried to play out from the back.</p>
      <p>Sloppy passing continued to blight the Gunners and Bellerin, making his first Premier League start since January after injury, gifted the ball to Ayoze Perez to fire over.</p>
      <p>Encouraged, Leicester pressed and only Calum Chambers’ telling touch on Perez’s low cross denied Vardy after 33 minutes.</p>
      <p>Arsenal were there for the taking but the Foxes’ lack of intensity aided the visitors.</p>
      <p>Maddison’s free-kick flew just over three minutes before the break and Harvey Barnes miscued a header.</p>

      <p>Yet the hosts came closer four minutes into the second half after finally upping the tempo.</p>
      <p>Fine work from Ricardo Pereira saw him cross for Wilfred Ndidi but his 16-yard effort slammed off the bar.</p>
      <p>Arsenal then thought they had opened the scoring after 55 minutes when Aubameyang converted Sead Kolasinac’s cross, only for the striker to be correctly ruled offside.</p>
      <p>But Leicester finally took control with 22 minutes left when Vardy continued his excellent record against the Gunners.</p>
      <p>A sweeping Leicester move ended with Youri Tielemans swapping passes with Barnes and Vardy found the corner from 12 yards.</p>
      <p>Four minutes later Bernd Leno denied Vardy a second before Maddison wrapped up the points with 15 minutes remaining.</p>
      <p>Pereira fed Vardy and he teed up Maddison to drill in a fine low effort from the edge of the box.</p>
