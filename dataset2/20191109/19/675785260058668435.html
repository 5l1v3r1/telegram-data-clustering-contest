      <h1>Leicester 2-0 Arsenal: Jamie Vardy and James Maddison down Gunners - 5 talking points</h1>
      <h2>Jamie Vardy and James Maddison found the net as Leicester climbed into second in the Premier League table</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T19:21:37+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 19:21</time> by <a rel="author">James Nursey, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/james-nursey/</a></address>
      <p>Leicester continued their push for the top four with a fine victory over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> at the King Power.</p>
      <p>Jamie Vardy and James Maddison were on target for the Foxes, who climb into second in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Arsenal are sixth and nine points adrift of Brendan Rodgers' side.</p>
      <p>Here are five talking points from the clash.</p>
      <h3>1. Pressure increases on Emery</h3>
      <p>This game made a half century in the Premier League for boss Unai Emery who had a record of W25, D12, L12 previously.</p>
      <p>And he won't want to remember it as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> beat Arsenal for a third consecutive top-flight home match for the first time.</p>
      <p>The odds must now be stacked against the Spanish coach lasting in charge until his ton on this evidence.</p>

      <p>Granted, Leicester were superb but Arsenal handed them the initiative from the start as they sat deep with a five-man defence in the first half.</p>
      <p>It helped Leicester dominate possession and they ran out deserved winners.</p>
      <p>It is now just one win in seven matches in all competitions for Emery,48, who was taunted by home fans that he will be “sacked in the morning”.</p>
      <h3>2. Ozil isolated in defeat</h3>

      <p>Mesut Ozil kept his place after coming in from the cold for Arsenal's previous Premier League game at home to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> .</p>
      <p>The German international had previously been out of favour with boss Emery who was looking to offload the big earner.</p>
      <p>But he remains popular with fans as underlined here where the away support made their feelings clear as they sung his name from just the third minutes onwards.</p>
      <p>He was isolated in the first half though and his set pieces could have been better as he failed to clear the first man with one corner.</p>
      <p>His body language as usual did not suggest a player busting his gut for the team either.</p>
      <h3>3. Gunners struggling for leaders</h3>

      <p>Granit Xhaka was missing again after being stripped of the captaincy following his angry exchange with home fans during the Gunners' 2-2 draw with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> on October 27.</p>
      <p>In his absence Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang led the visitors out but his leadership style is certainly rather different to club legend Tony Adams, who was in the stands as a TV pundit.</p>
      <p>Striker Aubameyang did find the back of the net in the second half but was judged offside on that occasion.</p>
      <p>He also shanked a right-foot cross straight out of play in the second half and was unable to make much impact on the contest.</p>
      <h3>4. Vardy can't stop scoring</h3>

      <p>Jamie Vardy took his tally for the season to 11 goals at the top of the goal scoring charts above 10-goal Tammy Abraham.</p>
      <p>Vardy clearly loves playing against Arsenal as he has now scored nine goals in his nine league starts against them.</p>
      <p>His tally of 20 Premier League goals in 22 games since boss Brendan Rodgers' arrival in February is five more than anyone else during that period.</p>
      <p>He scored the opener in the 68th minute after capping a fine team move with a first time right-foot finish and was only denied a second by a fine save by Bernd Leno.</p>
      <p>But he still found time to assist James Maddison to make it 2-0</p>
      <h3>5. Maddison a shout for England</h3>

      <p>James Maddison is in the England squad for the forthcoming games with Montenegro and Kosovo.</p>
      <p>And the star must be desperate that he gets his chance to win his first cap because he is certainly bang in form after his sixth goal of the season in all competitions.</p>
      <p>He also took set-pieces, like in the 42nd minute when his free-kick whistled on to the roof of the net, and he was always looking for the killer pass to unlock the visitors.</p>
      <p>He impressed in his favourite No.10 role but he doesn't just have a free role to do what he likes.</p>
      <p>Boss Rodgers has got Maddison tracking back and working like never before to win tackles and close down opponents.</p>
      <p>But he still got into great positions , like in the 75th minute to thump a low first time right-foot shot into the bottom corner from Vardy's lay-off</p>
