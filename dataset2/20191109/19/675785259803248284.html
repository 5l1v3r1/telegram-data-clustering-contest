      <h1>Leeds Utd slammed for link to firm selling Tasers like one which killed Dalian Atkinson</h1>
      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Championship side Leeds United have linked up with US eBay-style site Wish which sells Taser guns like the one which killed tragic star Atkinson</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T19:54:56+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 19:54</time> by <a rel="author">Phil Cardy, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/phil-cardy/</a></address>
      <p>Leeds United have linked up with a controversial firm dealing in Taser guns like the one which killed tragic footballer Dalian Atkinson.</p>
      <p>The Championship club has signed a sponsorship agreement with US firm Wish, an eBay-style marketplace site that brings together buyers and sellers.</p>
      <p>But Wish’s listings include illicit stun guns said to be up to 20 times stronger than the weapon fired at ex-Premier League ace Atkinson by cops.</p>
      <p>One shocked fan said: “It’s the last thing we’d want Leeds associated with.”</p>
      <p>News of the deal with Wish comes days after a police officer was charged with murder over the death of Aston Villa legend Atkinson, 48, in 2016.</p>

      <p>Guns were yesterday still available from Wish for as little as £14, alongside an array of blades.</p>
      <p>Wish boasts its website has “put a digital shopping mall of affordable goods directly in the pockets of consumers worldwide”.</p>
      <p>And Leeds trumpeted Wish’s arrival as the club’s Official Presenting Partner, with signs up around its Elland Road ground and the firm’s logo on manager Marcelo Bielsa’s famous bucket seat.</p>
      <p>But supporters who sign up for Wish’s deals will find listings for weaponry and fakes within just a few clicks.</p>
      <p>Wish does not own any of the items being sold, instead making its money by charging vendors a commission.</p>
      <p>It has been known to trade in potentially dangerous products like stun guns and knives for several years – and even lists fake Chinese-made Leeds United kits that go for £15 compared to £50 for official ones in the club shop.</p>

      <p>The firm said there are 180 million items on the platform but it tried to keep on top of what was being sold.</p>
      <p>A spokesman said: “Listings that breach the Wish policy will be removed immediately. Wish doesn’t condone the listing or sale of illegal knives or weapons on our UK platform.”</p>
      <p>Tasers are in the spotlight after news of the prosecution emerged over Atkinson’s death at the hands of police in Shropshire. Atkinson won the League Cup with Villa and also played for Ipswich, Sheffield Wednesday and Man City.</p>
      <p>A police officer will appear at Birmingham Crown Court later.</p>
      <p>In May Andrew Smith, 41, was jailed after he ordered a stun gun from Wish which was seized by customs at Gatwick.</p>
