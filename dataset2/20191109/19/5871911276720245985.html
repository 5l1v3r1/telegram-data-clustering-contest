      <h1>Your Daily Cartoon: If students followed Kawhi Leonard's load management plan</h1>

      <p>Load management is all the rage in the NBA these days, as some of the league’s biggest stars are electing to sit out and rest, rather than play in games — usually when their team plays on consecutive nights (back-to-backs).</p>
      <p>Clippers star Kawhi Leonard, the reigning NBA Finals MVP, chose to sit out a game last week already, less than a month into the season. That prompted a lot of criticism, and other takes.</p>
      <p>Just imagine if students took the same approach.</p>
