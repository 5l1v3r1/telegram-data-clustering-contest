      <p>PARIS: French insurer AXA said it expected to book net proceeds of US$3.1 billion from the sale of a 29 per cent stake in AXA Equitable Holdings (EQH) as it exits its US life insurance business.</p>
      <p>AXA, the second-largest European insurer after Germany's Allianz , has been gradually divesting from EQH to raise funds to pay for its US$15 billion acquisition of Bermuda-based rival XL last year.</p>

      <p>AXA said in a statement on Friday it had sold 144 million EQH shares at US$21.80 per share to Goldman Sachs , the sole underwriter in a secondary public share offering expected to close on Nov 13.</p>
      <p>EQH has agreed to repurchase 24 million shares at the same price.</p>
      <p>AXA said that proceeds from the deal would boost the group's Solvency II capital requirements ratio by six points and that no significant net income impact was expected.</p>
      <p>After the deal, the French group will retain only a 9.6 per cent stake it needs to redeem an AXA bond maturing in May 2021 that has to be exchangeable in EQH shares.</p>
