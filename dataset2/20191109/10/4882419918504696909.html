      <h1>Barcelona president Bartomeu likely to be succeeded by Rousaud or Tomás</h1>
      <h2>With elections due in 2021, the board must decide who will front their campaign</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T10:56:59+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 10:56</time> by <a rel="author">Joan Vehils</a></address>
      <p>Jordi Cardoner was expected to be the man to take over from Josep Maria Bartomeu but he announced on Friday that he will not run to be president in 2021.</p>
      <p>Barcelona will hold elections to appoint a new president in less than two years, but Bartomeu cannot stand again having already served his time.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the current board will have to find someone else to front their project. Cardoner was the favourite but he has decided the tole is not for him,</p>
      <p>That leaves two men as the most likely to take over from Bartomeu: Emili Rousaud or Oriol Tomás.- The former has not been one of the most involved directors during Bartomeu's tenure but has strong support and a good CV.</p>
      <p>Tomás, meanwhile, has already told Bartomeu he would like to take on the role. He knows the football world well and, importantly, how Barça work. He's had links with mega-companies like Nike, Danone and Procter&amp;Gamble in the past.</p>
      <p>Whoever it is, they will likely face competition from Victor Font, Joan Laporta and Agusti Benedito, who are all expected to run in the elections, among others.</p>
