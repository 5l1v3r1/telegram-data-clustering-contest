      <h1>General election 2019: Conservatives commit to boost GP numbers</h1>

      <p>The Conservative Party has said it will fund the training of an additional 500 GPs in England every year if they win the election.</p>
      <p>It would mean up to an additional 3,000 newly-qualified GPs or doctors doing their GP training in surgeries by 2024-2025 in an aim to reduce patient waiting times.</p>

      <p>The Tories say it would see the current tally of 3,538 GPs in training each year rise to around 4,000 from 2021.</p>
      <p>However, the party previously failed to meet a pledge to recruit an extra 5,000 GPs by 2020.</p>
      <p>Labour said it would also invest in family doctor services and more GPs and added it had become “harder and harder to get a GP appointment under the Tories”.</p>
      <p>The Conservative Party said it would also recruit thousands more NHS nurses, physios and pharmacists to work in surgeries and ensure all patients can book and have a consultation on the phone or online.</p>
      <p>They have pledged to invest £2.5bn over four years and forecast a 15 per cent increase in appointments over the course of a year, which currently stands at 300m in England.</p>
      <p>Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: “We all know the feeling of ringing a GP surgery first thing in the morning, holding on to get an appointment. </p>
      <p>“We recognise our GPs are under increasing pressure, so we will put record funding into our GP surgeries, and to help everyone get the care they need,” he said.</p>
      <p>Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth announced Labour’s plans to expand GP training places at the party’s conference last month.</p>

      <p>He said they would increase from 3,500 to 5,000 a year to ease the burden on GPs.</p>
      <p>“You can’t trust the Tories with our NHS,” he said. “They always make election promises which they fail to deliver on. </p>
      <p>“Tory ministers promised us 5,000 extra GPs but in fact we have lost 1,600 GPs under the Tories.”</p>
