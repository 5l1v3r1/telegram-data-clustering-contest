        <b>Daniel Ricciardo believes that he would have done a better job than Valtteri Bottas in 2019 if he was in the Finn's Mercedes seat.

      <p>Ricciardo made the questionable move to Renault for 2019 and has not appeared on the podium since, sitting in ninth in the drivers' standings.</p>

      <p>Tipped as a future champion in 2014 when he outperformed four time champion Sebastian Vettel at Red Bull Racing, Ricciardo's career never really kicked on, but he still believes that if given the opportunity, he can make it count.</p>
      <p>He told Sky Sports that he could've challenged Hamilton in a Mercedes this year, saying: <i>“I won’t sugar coat it: I’ll say yes.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“That’s because I have that belief in myself. It’s not targeted at Valtteri or anyone else in that car who didn’t win."</i>
      </p>
      <p>Hamilton won the title last time out at the United States Grand Prix, with two rounds left to run. Will we ever see Ricciardo challenge for a title? Vote below!</p>
