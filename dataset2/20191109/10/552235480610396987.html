      <h1>Who Celtic and Rangers could face in the Europa League last 32</h1>
      <h2>Things could still change but there are some potentially tasty draws for both teams as things stand.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T10:46:55+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 10:46</time> by <a rel="author">Gabriel McKay</a></address>
      <p>After a fantastic week for Scotland's two <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/europa-league">Europa League</a> representatives, thoughts have already started to turn to the last 32 of the competition.</p>
      <p>Celtic assured their place in the knockout rounds with a stirring win over Lazio at the Stadio Olimpico, and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> gave themselves a great chance of qualifying with their rousing 2-0 victory over Porto at Ibrox.</p>
      <p>The results gave the Scottish coefficient a boost, with the Scottish Premiership now within striking distance of the Cypriot top flight in 15th.</p>
      <p>Reaching the top 15 would give Scotland an extra <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/champions-league">Champions League</a> place for the 2021-22 season, with the league runners-up entering at the first qualifying round and the Premiership winner in the second.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>To do that though both teams need to pick up some more wins, and both reaching the knockout rounds would bolster that significantly.</p>
      <p>Celtic and Rangers cannot play each other in the last 32 due to UEFA's country protection but the pair could be drawn together if they reach the last 16 when the tournament becomes an open draw.</p>
      <p>If the Scottish sides win their groups they are currently set to avoid big-hitters Arsenal and Manchester United with both English sides leading the way in their respective sections.</p>

      <p>As things stand <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> are top of their group and would go through as a seeded team, while Steven Gerrard's side are currently second and would go through without being seeded.</p>
      <p>The knockout phase sees the 12 group winners plus the four third-placed Champions League teams with the best record given seeded status, while the runners-up in the Europa League and the other four Champions League side are unseeded.</p>
      <p>Teams from the same group cannot face each other in the last 32, so Celtic cannot face Cluj or Lazio and Rangers cannot be drawn against Young Boys, Feyenoord or Porto.</p>
      <p>Sevilla are currently the only guaranteed seeded team, having won their group with four wins from four games.</p>
      <p>With two games to go things could still change, here are the potential opponents for both Scottish teams.</p>
      <h3>Celtic</h3>

      <p>Neil Lennon's side are currently top of their group so would be seeded for the last 32 if they finish first.</p>
      <p>That should give them an easier draw but there are still some big-hitters lying in wait.</p>
      <p>As things stand the likes of former foes Zenit St Petersburg and Wolves will be going through unseeded, while Red Star are poised to come down from the Champions League.</p>
      <p>Borussia Monchengladbach are currently top of the Bundesliga and as things stand they'll also be going through in second place. That would mean a reunion with Marco Rose.</p>
      <p>The former Salzburg boss was among the bookies' favourites for the Celtic job before making the switch to Germany.</p>
      <p>They're in Group J which is currently very tight, so Roma or Basaksehir could also end up in second place after the final two games.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Potential opponents:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Apoel</p>
      <p>Dynamo Kiev</p>
      <p>Getafe</p>
      <p>LASK</p>
      <p>Standard Liege</p>
      <p>Ludogorets</p>
      <p>Wolfsburg</p>
      <p>Borussia Monchengladbach</p>
      <p>Wolves</p>
      <p>AZ Alkmaar</p>
      <p>Zenit St Petersburg</p>
      <p>Lokomotiv Moscow</p>
      <p>Red Star</p>
      <p>Club Brugge</p>
      <h3>Rangers</h3>

      <p>Rangers can still win their group but as things stand they'd be going through in second place behind Young Boys.</p>
      <p>That would mean a tough draw for the last 32 with Europa League specialists Sevilla already guaranteed to be seeded.</p>
      <p>The Spanish club have won the competition five times, including three years in a row between 2014 and 2016.</p>
      <p>A Battle of Britain could be on the cards with Manchester United and Arsenal both currently topping their sections, and there's also the prospect of the team which comes third in the Champions League group of death.</p>
      <p>Inter are currently third in Group F and both Barcelona and Borussia Dortmund can still finish in third place.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Potential opponents:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sevilla</p>
      <p>Copenhagen</p>
      <p>Basel</p>
      <p>Sporting</p>
      <p>Arsenal</p>
      <p>Espanyol</p>
      <p>Gent</p>
      <p>Basaksehir</p>
      <p>Braga</p>
      <p>Manchester United</p>
      <p>Valencia</p>
      <p>Dinamo Zagreb</p>
      <p>RB Salzburg</p>
      <p>Inter</p>
