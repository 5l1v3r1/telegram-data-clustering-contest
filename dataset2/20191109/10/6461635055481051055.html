      <h1>Barcelona vs Celta: Expected Starting XI for very important league clash</h1>

      <h3>Barcelona are struggling to establish a lead at the top of the league table</h3>
      <p>The goalless draw with Slavia Prague suggests that Barcelona’s home form is a myth too. The team is playing poorly, both at home and away. That makes the match against Celta Vigo even more important, with league leadership on the line.</p>
      <p>Jordi Alba will not be playing due to a knock he picked up in the last game. La Masia graduates Carles Pérez and Carles Aleñá have been left out of the matchday squad for tactical reasons, along with French youngster Jean-Clair Todibo.</p>
      <h4>Expected Starting XI (4-3-3):</h4>
      <p><b>Goalkeeper</b>: Marc-André ter Stegen<br/><b>Right-back</b>: Sergi Roberto<br/><b>Centre-back(right)</b>: Gerard Piqué<br/><b>Centre-back(left)</b>: Samuel Umtiti<br/><b>Left-back</b>: Junior Firpo<br/><b>Central playmaker(right)</b>: Arturo Vidal<br/><b>Holding midfielder</b>: Frenkie de Jong<br/><b>Central playmaker(left)</b>: Arthur<br/><b>Right winger</b>: Lionel Messi<br/><b>Centre-forward</b>: Antoine Griezmann<br/><b>Left winger</b>: Ansu Fati</p>
      <p>Marc-André ter Stegen will be starting in goal, and will be tested more than he was against Slavia Prague. At right-back, Nélson Semedo should be rested in favour of more playing time for Sergi Roberto. Gerard Piqué will be staying in the lineup.</p>
      <p>Samuel Umtiti could be set for a return to action, after impressing in his last start against Eibar. At left-back, Ernesto Valverde could finally award an opportunity to an actual left-back in Junior Firpo instead of going for a makeshift, right-footed full-back.</p>
      <p>In midfield, Arthur will finally make a comeback after completely sitting out the last couple of games. He will provide the much-needed stability in possession, with Frenkie de Jong slotting into a holding role. The in-form Arturo Vidal is expected to retain his spot.</p>
      <p>Up top, Lionel Messi remains a constant as he continues to build up momentum in order to hit top form. But despite returning from injury, Luis Suárez should not be put straight back into action. Instead, he should be kept on the bench as an emergency option.</p>
      <p>The sleepy, inert Antoine Griezmann deserves a shot as the main man. This could also allow Ansu Fati to get some more playing time. Ousmane Dembélé remains a very effective option off the bench. With luck, Barça will be able to get past Celta Vigo.</p>
