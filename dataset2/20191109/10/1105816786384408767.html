      <h1>Barty helps Australia level Fed Cup final</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T10:54:37+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 10:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/76/afp/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p><b>PERTH: </b>Ashleigh Barty played the “best match of her life” to crush Caroline Garcia 6-0, 6-0 and haul Australia back into contention at the Fed Cup final Saturday after France’s Kristina Mladenovic whipped Ajla Tomljanovic.</p>
      <p>The world number one, fresh from winning the WTA Finals in China, came on court in Perth under pressure after the nervous Tomljanovic was thrashed 6-1, 6-1.</p>
      <p>But in searing 38 Celsius (100 Fahrenheit) heat she kept her cool to embarrass a stunned Garcia in a rare double bagel, with the Frenchwoman having no answers to the Barty armoury in front of 13,000 fans.</p>
      <p>It left the tie evenly poised at 1-1 ahead of Sunday’s reverse singles and a doubles clash if needed, with Australia targeting an eighth title and first in 45 years, while France are seeking a third, their first since 2003.</p>
      <p>“This is remarkable, I couldn’t have asked for a more perfect match. I think that’s the best tennis match I’ve ever played in my life,” said Barty. “I felt like I served really well, made a lot of returns. Most importantly I played the big points well. I really wanted to assert myself and I was able to do that really well today.”</p>
      <p>The French Open champion, capping a breakthrough season, was imperious, firing down pinpoint first serves and effortlessly pushing Garcia around the court, forcing errors.</p>
      <p>She set the tone by breaking Garcia’s first service game and there was no way back for a player who was once ranked fourth in the world but has slipped to 45.</p>
      <p>Barty wrapped up the first set in 29 minutes and there was no let up as she sent down 11 forehand and four backhand winners.</p>
      <p>“I was a little bit stressed today, but not too stressed, and I don’t think that was why I didn’t play well,” said Garcia. “Today she just played a very good match from the first point to the last one.”</p>
      <p>The ease of Barty’s 56-minute win was a huge relief for Australian captain Alicia Molik, whose gamble to play Tomljanovic in singles ahead of veteran Samantha Stosur spectacularly backfired.</p>
