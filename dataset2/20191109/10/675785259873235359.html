      <h1>Date when you should buy a Christmas tree - and how long it will last for</h1>
      <h2>As December draws closer, you might be starting to feel rather festive and wondering when the right time is to begin decking the halls and putting up the Christmas tree</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T10:36:14+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 10:36</time> by <a rel="author">Courtney Pochin, https://www.facebook.com/courtneypochinmirror/?modal=admin_todo_tour</a></address>
      <p>It's something we all wonder at this time of year - when should we get the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/christmas-decorations">Christmas decorations</a> out?</p>
      <p>Some very excited people across the UK have likely already put their trees up, but is it actually too early to do so?</p>
      <p>If you're going to buy a real tree this year, then it probably is still a bit soon to be heading out to the shops for one.</p>
      <p>That's according to the experts over at the British Christmas Tree Growers Association (BCTGA).</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>On their <a href="https://www.bctga.co.uk/info-for-buyers/care-of-trees.html">website, the BCTGA</a> suggest that real Christmas trees should "not be purchased earlier than 1st December".</p>
      <p>This is because, if cared for correctly, the tree should survive a little over four weeks.</p>
      <p>So if you want your <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/christmas-trees">tree</a> to stay standing and be twinkling away on the big day, you probably don't want to get it just yet, or else it might be looking a little sad come the 25th.</p>
      <p>The BCTGA add: "It is part of the life cycle of the conifer tree that it sheds needles and they will accelerate that shedding particularly if they dry out. Some trees do so more quickly than others.</p>

      <p>"A tree should be treated like any plant being brought into a warm, dry atmosphere."</p>
      <p>Obviously an artificial Christmas tree is not limited in the same way and can be put up at any date of your choosing.</p>
      <p>If you follow tradition, it's likely that you'll keep your tree and all the decorations up until Twelfth Night - 12 nights after Christmas.</p>
      <p>This will be January 5 or 6, depending on whether you count Christmas Day as the first day or not.</p>

      <p>Another question you might find yourself asking once you've got your tree is how many decorations to use.</p>
      <p>Again, this is up to personal preference - you can put as many baubles and chocolates on the branches as you want to.</p>
      <p>However last week, a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/christmas-tree-guide-shows-correct-20815364">decorating guide</a> went viral on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> after being shared on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/316606899105498/">Mrs Hinch Made Me Do It</a>   <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a>  group.</p>
      <p>It claimed to reveal the ideal ratio for baubles and lights depending on the height of your tree.</p>
      <p>The guide suggest a 3ft tree should be decked out with 20 baubles and a string of 50 lights.</p>
      <p>A 6ft tree will take 240 bulbs and 50 baubles and if you're lucky enough to have room for a tree over 7ft (the bigger the better) then you can use between 400-1,000 lights and 90 baubles depending on the size of the whopper.</p>
      <p>If you're still feeling a little unsure about the whole thing, a fellow mum also shared a link to an <a href="https://www.admiral.com/xmas-tree-calculator?fbclid=IwAR1bUVQR5fTvxa5uMKM90fg5GQZ6jOYnMyDO7enBIe_S8mVgVT_Umsxjgog">online bauble calculator</a> which may come in handy.</p>
