      <p>ASRock has announced their latest Phantom Gaming series graphics cards today. The new cards include the Radeon RX <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/5700-xt/">5700 XT</a> Phantom Gaming D 8G OC, and the Radeon RX 5700 Phantom Gaming D 8G OC. Of course, they’re all based around the current 7nm design of the <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/amd/">AMD</a> RX 5700 series GPUs. These come with 8 GB GDDR6 memory, and support for PCIe 4.0. However, they also come tuned to run harder and faster than the OEM version. They use a triple-fan design, huge heatsink design and a metal backplate to unleash the best performance from the latest chipset.</p>
