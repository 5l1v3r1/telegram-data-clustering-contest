      <p>EARLIER this year Virginia Heneghan set up Mayo Yoga with Aromatherapy, which operates out of the Kachina Alternative Health and Beauty Centre at Moneen, Castlebar, writes Tom Gillespie.</p>
      <p>Daughter of Martin and Yvonne Heneghan of Breaffy, Virginia said: "At the moment it’s just myself running the business and it’s going from strength to strength. I also offer my services to local community centres, which has been a huge success."</p>
      <p>Virginia has a diploma in aromatherapy. She also studied yoga in Galway and after completing two years studying, set up the business.</p>
      <p>She explained: "I offer yoga classes for all abilities combined with aromatherapy for well-being and health. I differ from other yoga classes as I combine aromatherapy in all of my yoga classes."</p>
      <p>Aromatherapy is the practice of using the natural oils extracted from flowers, bark, stems, leaves, roots or other parts of a plant to enhance psychological and physical well-being.</p>
      <p>The inhaled aroma from these essential oils is widely believed to stimulate brain function. Essential oils can also be absorbed through the skin, where they travel through the bloodstream and can promote whole-body healing.</p>
      <p>Aromatherapy, a form of alternative medicine, is gaining momentum. It is used for a variety of applications, including pain relief, mood enhancement and increased cognitive function. There are a wide number of essential oils available, each with its own healing properties.</p>
      <p>Yoga is the gentle movement or stretching of the body while, at the same time, practising on your breathing.</p>
      <p>Virginia has been using aromatherapy oils for over 10 years as opposed to using medicines.</p>
      <p>She said: "I decided to study them and I have a diploma in aromatherapy. I have been practising yoga for years and I decided to combine the yoga with the aromatherapy for well-being and health. I felt it would be a good way to help and heal people.</p>
      <p>"At each class I introduce a different oil. We put one or two drops of oil on the palm of the hand, rubbing it together, and we all take a few breaths of it.</p>
      <p>"As the weeks and months went by I got great feedback from people saying they were sleeping better at night.</p>
      <p>"I take maybe eight to nine per class. I don’t like big groups. I gear the yoga poses - some are good for depression or anxiety - and I combine that with the oils. Each class is an hour and we warm up first. We do our yoga poses. We cool down and we have five minutes at the end of meditation, lying down fully relaxed, and I play frequency music at the end of the classes."</p>
      <p>She continued: "I have had feedback from one lady whose mother was really ill and she wasn’t getting much sleep. But since she started she is feeling great.</p>
      <p>"Yoga now is becoming very commercialised and I am trying to keep it as pure as it should be. It is all about healing."</p>
      <p>Virginia caters for all ages with the oldest in her class being almost 80 years.</p>
      <p>She said: "The older people love it and some come twice a week. I always try the gentle approach. I do not do the hard, hard yoga as people have injuries and they are not able for the hard yoga exercises.</p>
      <p>"It can be very beneficial. You are stretching the body and muscles that have never been stretched.</p>
      <p>"I had a leg injury and yoga has helped me. I spent thousands going to doctors and from pillar to post without any relief. I went to the alternative and it worked and my aches and pains have never come back."</p>
      <p>Virginia holds evening classes in Ballyheane (Friday) and Manulla (Tuesday). She also offers one-to-one with the yoga and aromatherapy and she does a men’s only class on a Thursday evening at 7 p.m.</p>
      <p>She stated: "I offer something completely different from other yoga teachers. My method is more therapeutic and healing. As far as I know I am the only one doing yoga and aromatherapy.</p>
      <p>"Both yoga and aromatherapy are holistic practices that can help you improve the health of your mind, body, and soul.</p>
      <p>"Using aromatherapy during your yoga practice, a practice sometimes referred to as ‘yogaroma’, can help you clear your mind, relax your body, and open your soul, so you can focus and get the most out of your yoga routine.</p>
      <p>"My therapeutic yoga classes combined with aromatherapy are suitable for all abilities. I incorporate aromatherapy oils at our yoga classes for complete relaxation."</p>
      <p>When not practising yoga and aromatherapy Virginia is addicted to road racing and recently she covered over 130km on her carbon bike.</p>
      <p>She said: "I was running for about 15 years but I had to give it up when I injured my leg. That was when I took up road racing. I love it and I go all over the country."</p>
      <p>Virginia’s classes are small to ensure a very unique yoga experience and they are held at Kachina, at the Mayo Leisure Point, Moneen, Castlebar.</p>
      <p>Classes are available Monday to Friday, and booking is essential on (087) 2831400. The cost per class is €10.</p>
