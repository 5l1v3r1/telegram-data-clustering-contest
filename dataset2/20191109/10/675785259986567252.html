      <p>The actress, who rose to fame as Rachel Green, blew everyone away with her first ever <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> post.</p>
      <p>She joined Matthew, Courteney, Lisa, David Schwimmer and Matt LeBlanc for dinner at Courteney's house.</p>
      <p>It prompted rumours that the cast were set to get the old gang back together once more, but Jen denied there would be a reunion.</p>
      <p>Speaking on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, she said her and her fellow stars would love there to be "something" but they aren't yet sure what that "something" is.</p>

      <p>However during an interview on Howard Stern's Sirius XM Radio, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jennifer-aniston">the actress</a> confessed that while she missed the show, a reboot wasn't a good idea.</p>
      <p>She said: "We all miss it every day. I would be nothing without it […] If there’s a reboot of the show, it won’t be as good as what it was, so why do it? It would ruin it."</p>
      <p>Her words echoed those of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/friends">Friends</a> co-creator Marta Kauffman who has always insisted that a reboot would never happen.</p>
