      <h1>From Relegation Candidates To Top 8 Contenders…</h1>

      <p>AmaZulu have been lauded for their improvement in recent matches, since the Absa Premiership’s restart after the FIFA international break. </p>
      <p>After conceding a whopping 11 goals from eight matches earlier in the season, Usuthu have showed massive improvement in their defence, with the team not conceding in the last two matches.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The Durban-based side kept clean sheets in both matches against Baroka FC and Stellenbosch FC respectively.</p>
      <p>Usuthu won both matches and moved away from relegation zone up to 12th on the log to continue showing improvement under Slovakian coach Jozef Vukusic.</p>

      <p>The team takes on struggling Chippa United at the Princess Magogo Stadium this evening. AmaZulu's next match will be against Mamelodi Sundowns at Loftus Versfeld Stadium on November 26.</p>
      <p>“Keeping a clean sheet is as good as scoring a goal. If you are able to prevent the other team from scoring, then one goal is good enough to get the win, so the pressure is taken off our attackers to keep providing a number of goals. Defenders don’t always get the recognition they deserve and I think now that we have gone back to back games without conceding a goal, it is a massive confidence booster for us going into the next game,” said AmaZulu defender Mario Booysen, as quoted on the club’s official website. </p>
