      <p>An anonymous reader quotes Quanta magazine: <i>A provocative paper published in the journal <i>Nature Astronomy</i> argues that <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/what-shape-is-the-universe-closed-or-flat-20191104">the universe may curve around and close in on itself like a sphere</a>, rather than lying flat like a sheet of paper as the standard theory of cosmology predicts. The authors reanalyzed a major cosmological data set and concluded that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-019-0906-9">the data favors a closed universe</a> with 99% certainty â€” even as other evidence suggests the universe is flat.</i></p>
