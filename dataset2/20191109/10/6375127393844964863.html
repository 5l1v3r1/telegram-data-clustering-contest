      <h3>NATHALIE Hart is back after giving birth to her daughter, Penelope, in Sydney, Australia. She looked so sexy at the presscon of her iWant movie, “Barbara Reimagined”, a remake of “Patayin Mo sa Sindak si Barbara” which has movie versions in 1974 starring Susan Roces as directed by the late Celso Ad. Castillo, in 1995 with Lorna Tolentino as directed by Chito Rono and as a TV mini series in 2008 with Kris Aquino directed by Jerry Sineneng. When asked how she would compare her performance as Barbara to that of Susan, LT and Kris, she quickly demurred.</h3>
      <p>“Please, there should be no comparison,” she says. “They’re all established stars na and also, iba-iba kami ng interpretation. Magugulat kayo kasi ibang-iba ang version namin with Direk Benedict Mique.

      <p>Did the wedding she plan  with the Indian national who is the dad of her baby pushed through? “No, we decided not to go on with it. I’m only 27 and he’s 26, he’s still studying and working at the same time. Also, I’m not yet ready to settle down with him in India. I told him I want to go back to work here para mag-ipon muna and okay naman sa kanya. So now, we have LDR (long distance relationship) and he just comes here to visit our baby. For more than six months naman, housewife lang ako doon sa kanila, nag-alaga ng anak ko, I do everything sa bahay. Dito, I’m a single parent, mahirap but wala naman akong choice kasi nga I want to resume my career here.”</p>
      <p>Is she still open to do sexy roles? “Okay lang naman. Basta the project is good and my character is great, I’m willing to do it. Like here in ‘Barbara</p>
