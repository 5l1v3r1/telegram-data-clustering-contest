      <p>PUNE: At 39, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Tejaswini-Sawant">Tejaswini Sawant</a> is finally close to realising her long-cherished dream of becoming an Olympian.</p>
      <p>Should it happen, of which there can be little doubt, none would deserve it more than the former world champion.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, the Kolhapur shooter clinched a quota for the 2020 <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Tokyo-Games">Tokyo Games</a> by finishing fourth in women’s 50m 3 Position rifle. As five of the eight finalists had already qualified for Tokyo, Tejaswini’s entry to eight-woman final was enough to grab one of the three quota places on offer.</p>
      <p>Tejaswini shot 1,171 (out of 1,200) in the qualification but missed the medal after a fourth-place finish (435.8).</p>
      <p>After a series of heartbreaks, dip in form and family commitments, Tejaswini’s a decade and a half quest to qualify for the Games finally ended on Saturday. She had won gold in 50m rifle prone event at the World Championships in 2010. Since women’s prone was never an Olympic event, she has remained a World Champion without the Olympian’s tag.</p>
      <p>“I feel my struggle to qualify for Olympics has finally come to an end,” an elated Tejaswini told TOI.</p>
      <p>The shooter had missed out on qualifying for the Beijing edition four times.</p>
      <p>The pattern continued ahead of the 2012 Olympics, while she was out of touch with the sport ahead of the 2016 Games. This year, Tejaswini participated only in one quota event (finished 47th in Rio de Janeiro World Cup), before the Asian Championships.</p>
      <p>“In the 2008 qualifiers, I had missed three quotas even after getting my scores tied. Then, the tie was broken by count back (the shooter with a better score in the previous shot gaining the advantage). Once, I missed it by one point. It was the same before 2012. It wasn’t as close as 2008 though,” Tejaswini said.</p>
      <p>After 2013, Tejaswini sort of lost touch with shooting due to her mother’s health issues. She began training again in 2016 and came back into the Indian team in 2017.</p>
      <p>The turning point for Tejaswini came at the Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, Australia, last year, where she won gold in 3P and silver in prone. It was her only podium finish between the 2010 World Championships and now.</p>
      <p>“The CWG medals made me realise that age is not a barrier at all. I had such a great support from my family and my coach (Kuheli Gangulee) that I had to do well for them. I wanted to win the quota for them,” she said.</p>
      <p>One thing that has kept Tejaswini in good stead is her adherence to the routine.</p>
      <p>“I don’t believe in doing anything fancy. I follow my coach’s plan and I do it without any break. I have been training for only 2-3 hours a day, but I have been consistently following this,” she said.</p>
      <p>For her coach, it is all about never giving up. “She has proved that she is mentally and physically fit to shoot at the world stage. She has been shooting better since the format changed from 60 shots to 120 shots. She could improve her performance because endurance wise, she is at par with any young shooter and she has showed enough strength by striking a right balance between her personal and professional life,” Gangulee said.</p>
      <p>“She couldn’t keep her place in the Indian team and since time was running out, we decided to play her in open international tournaments in Czech Republic and Hannover. It helped her get scores to enter the team again,” the coach said.</p>
      <p>Having won the quota, the focus now is to maintain her form. “I think my coach is going to ask me to shoot for 7-8 hours a day from tomorrow onwards. But I am ready,” Tejaswini said.</p>
