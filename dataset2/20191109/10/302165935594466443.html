      <p>KUALA SELANGOR, Nov 9 — The Health Ministry will announce the new consultation fees for private general medical practitioners by the end of this year.</p>
      <p>Health Minister Datuk Seri Dzulkefly Ahmad said the review on the matter was currently in the final stage.</p>
      <p>“I have been given a briefing on the standardisation of the consultation fees by the National Cost of Living Action Council.</p>
      <p>“I’m confident that it (the review) can be completed by year-end and once I get the approval from the council, I will present the matter to the Cabinet (to finalise the rate),” he told reporters after officiating a health camp programme here today.</p>
      <p>General practitioners have been calling for the fee harmonisation as it had not been revised for nearly 12 years.</p>
      <p>The consultation fees were proposed to be increased between RM35 and RM125 from RM10 and RM35.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Dzulkefly said the ministry would further strengthen the country’s traditional and complementary medicine (T&amp;CM).</p>
      <p>“Since the Traditional and Complementary Medicine Act 2016 (Act 775) was introduced, we have 15 public hospitals that provide T&amp;CM treatments ranging from post-natal and primary health care. — Bernama</p>
