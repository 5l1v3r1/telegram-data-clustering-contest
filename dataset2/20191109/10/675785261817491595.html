      <h1>A Hat in Time review: A tip of the hat to classic 3D platformers</h1>
      <h2>Despite some technical issues, the Switch edition of A Hat in the Time is both a throwback to platformer classics and a charming genre entry that stands on its own two feet</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T10:53:51+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 10:53</time> by <a rel="author">Ryan Brown, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/ryan-brown/</a></address>
      <p>Although forgotten about for many years, the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/video-games">3D platformer</a> has had something of a comeback in recent years.</p>
      <p>Raised on the likes of Banjo-Kazooie, Super Mario 64, and Spyro the Dragon, the children of the 90s  - myself included - are all grown up and many have been eager for the return of a genre long thought dead. That demand has led to Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon making unexpected comebacks, as well as Yooka-Laylee, developed by many people from the original teams behind Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64.</p>
      <p>Originally released in 2017 after a surprisingly successful crowdfunding campaign, A Hat in Time is a throwback 3D platformer that acts as a love letter to its predecessors of yesteryear. Despite releasing in a similar timeframe to the much higher-profile <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tech/yooka-laylee-review-strings-best-10176355">Yooka-Laylee</a> , and being developed by a much less experienced team, A Hat in Time smashes it to smithereens.</p>
      <p>There's no point in beating around the bush here - it's not without its issues, but A Hat in Time is the best indie 3D platformer ever made, and it's perfectly at home on the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/nintendo-switch">Nintendo Switch</a> .</p>

      <p>You take the role of Hat Kid, a little girl attempting to return home in her spaceship, whose magical 'Time Pieces' get sucked out of your ship and littered over the world below. This is the admittedly flimsy premise that sets up your goal of collecting all 40 Time Pieces, but you'll come across so many dazzling personalities during your short journey, you can easily forgive the lack of a serious plot. After all, which 3D platformer out there is strongly narrative-driven?</p>
      <p>At its core, A Hat in Time's gameplay is of course very similar to the aforementioned games it takes inspiration from. You run, jump, and whack enemies with your umbrella to complete levels and seek out collectibles.</p>
      <p>Time Rift bonus levels play like those found in Super Mario 64, and tokens can be exchanged for costume changes. Enemies drop a currency which can be used to purchase upgrades for your hat - which, as the title suggests, itself plays a significant role.</p>

      <p>You'll accumulate six main hats throughout the course of the game, each possessing their own unique, mostly useful abilities. Your default hat helps show the way to the closest point of interest, which I didn't find particularly useful, both the others grant you explosive potions, icy ground pounds, time freezing, and more. Some more variety would've been nice, but A Hat in Time makes the most of the ones it has, thanks to surprisingly intuitive, tight controls.</p>
      <p>With just four main worlds, A Hat in Time is short, but its varied and manages to avoid cliche themed worlds. Rather conveniently, I enjoyed each new world more than the last. The first world is easily its weakest, and something I originally had to push through to find enjoyment from on my first playthrough, but it has its own charm and original ideas.</p>
      <p>The second world really ramps it up, with incredibly unique ideas and themes not seen before in the genre, with the last, more open world putting your platforming skills to the test.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>It's remarkable really how on the one hand, A Hat in Time is a throwback to old-school 3D platformers, and on the other, it genuinely introduces completely new ideas never explored before. It's as if it started development as a purely fun but derivative work of fanfare, but a bunch of unique ideas were thrown at the drawing board and ended up sticking. The murder mystery train level, for example, is particularly genius.</p>
      <p>Of course, as I mentioned at the start, as wonderful as A Hat in Time is, it's not lacking in problems. Performance-wise, it experiences some issues even on other platforms, but having finished it on the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/playstation-4">PlayStation 4</a> earlier in the year before tackling this Nintendo Switch version, this is unfortunate.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Framerate drops are frightfully regular occurrences - something which can really disrupt the flow of play in a precision-based platformer. There are frequent, distracting jitters, but there's even the occasional outright pause, and it really brings you out of the gameplay and can even potentially cause an unfair slip up.</p>
      <p>A Hat in Time is so perfect for a Nintendo console, the Switch version could easily be my preference of choice, but sadly until these problems are fixed it's likely better to play elsewhere if you're able. On the other hand, it does include the 'Seal the Deal' expansion, which still isn't available on PS4.</p>

      <p>Generally speaking, the simplicity of the graphics are usually part of the colourful, whimsical charm of the game, but sometimes backgrounds can look garish, or you'll spot some jagged edges.</p>
      <p>I also found it particularly jarring when in several individual cutscenes, some non-playable characters would have full voice acting, while others would not. For as much as I truly enjoyed A Hat in Time, I was often reminded that it is indeed an indie game made on a comparable shoestring budget by these little glaring moments.</p>
      <p>But they are little glaring moments, with even the performance issues taking a backseat to the sheer fun I was having with its refined gameplay and fantastic worlds. Nothing can stop A Hat in Time from being sheer, unbridled fun.</p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>I find myself saying this a lot, but in this case it's the absolute truth - A Hat in Time is a perfect fit for the Nintendo Switch. Despite some glaring technical problems, A Hat in Time plays, feels, and sounds exactly like any other beloved classic 3D platfomer, but introduces enough new ideas to truly stand up on its own two feet. It's one of the most memorable games I've played all year, and I already want more of it.</p>
      <p>If you manage to play this without cracking a smile, I'll eat my hat.</p>
