      <p>The NCP on Saturday welcomed the supreme court's landmark verdict that cleared way for the construction of a Ram Temple at the disputed site in Uttar Pradesh's <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ayodhya">Ayodhya </a>and asked all to respect the judgement.</p>
      <p>NCP chief <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sharad-pawar">Sharad Pawar </a>said the apex court's unanimous decision will help address a "serious concern" before the country.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court in a historic verdict on Saturday backed the construction of a Ram temple by a trust at the disputed site in Ayodhya, and ruled that an alternative five- acre plot must be found for a mosque in the Hindu holy town.</p>
      <p>"The supreme court's unanimous decision will help address a serious concern before the country. The judiciary has talked about protecting interests of all the sections of the society. It is a good thing," Pawar told reporters here.</p>
      <p>"I urge all the people of the country that an important, landmark judgement has been given. All sections of the society should welcome and respect it," the NCP chief said and urged people to ensure peace and harmony.</p>
      <p>On some BJP leaders visiting Ram temple after the verdict, Pawar said it is an individual's right and choice whether to visit a temple or Masjid.</p>
      <p>"There is no need to comment on it as it is not a political issue," he added.</p>
      <p>He also noted that several political parties have respected the decision which is a "good thing."<br/><br/>Pawar also said the verdict will have no bearing on Maharashtra politics and added that people may even forget the issue within two to three days.</p>
      <p>"This may not be an important subject for the public at large," he said.</p>
      <p>NCP chief spokesperson Nawab Malik hoped that no new dispute crops up in the country in the name of religion following the verdict.</p>
      <p>"It has been our position right from the beginning that we will accept the Supreme Court verdict and all should accept it. Hope no new dispute crops up in the country in the name of religion," Malik tweeted.</p>
      <p>Malik also urged people to maintain peace and harmony. Maharashtra NCP president Jayant Patil echoed similar view.</p>
      <p>"This verdict has respected faiths of both the communities. We are confident that the people of the country will also welcome the decision and the Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb will be intact," he said on Twitter.</p>
