      <p>A bookmakers accused of failing to protect a 'vulnerable' gambler during a betting spree has agreed to pay him more than £100,000.</p>
      <p>The high street bookies settled out of court with the 32 -year-old man who lost more than £134,000 playing roulette and blackjack online over an eight year period.</p>
      <p>His lawyers argued the bookies had breached the Gambling Commission's social responsibility code by allowing the regular customer to continue betting, despite him showing 'very obvious signs of problem gambling'.</p>
      <p>The customer, who like the bookmakers cannot be named under the terms of the agreement except to say he was based in the south of England, ended up in a lot of debt by borrowing money from family and friends.</p>
      <p>His lawyers were able to recoup 89 per cent of the punter's losses, securing a six figure payout, before the case went to the High Court.</p>

      <p>Henrietta Dunkley, of the Ellis Jones solicitors who acted in the case, said the gambler made numerous smaller deposits which added up to thousands of pounds each day.</p>
      <p>She said: "Our client had been gambling for eight years with a number of different providers but we were able to secure a settlement with this one as they had acted particularly badly.</p>
      <p>"It should have been apparent quite early on there was an issue as he was making lots of little deposits adding up to thousands of pounds each day.</p>
      <p>"He had shown very obvious signs of problem gambling for a considerable amount of time and was spending far beyond his means, losing well in excess of £100,000.</p>

      <p>"But instead of referring him to the Responsible Gambling team they ignored the red flags and let him carry on.</p>
      <p>"We were able to persuasively argue that there had been clear failings by the betting operator.</p>
      <p>"The firm had failed to protect him as a vulnerable customer and therefore breached a number of obligations set out within the Gambling Commission's Social Responsibility Code."</p>
      <p>Paul Kanolik, a partner in the firm's betting disputes team, argued the legal outcome underlined how customers should be given more protection by betting firms.</p>
      <p>He said: "This fantastic result is reflective of a much wider recognition by the Gambling Commission and other organisations that more protection is needed for gambling customers, particularly those that display obvious signs of problem gambling."</p>
