      <p>South Korean manufacturing giant, <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/samsung">Samsung</a>, is obviously working on the Samsung Galaxy S11 series. Early information about this series shows that it will have at least five models. According to @evleaks, this series will have a 6.2 or 6.4-inch, 6.7-inch, and 6.9-inch models. The 6.2 or 6.4-inch and 6.7-inch models will be available in 4G and 5G versions. However, the 6.9-inch version will only have a 5G model. None of these models will use a flat display.</p>

      <p>It is worth noting that XDA developers found “108MP” in OneUI. This indicates that Samsung is developing a smartphone with a 108MP camera. According to speculations, Samsung will probably use the 108MP on the Galaxy S11 series. In addition, it will also use the flagship Snapdragon 865 SoC.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, @evleaks revealed that all five models will come with a curved-edge display. This means that the S11 series will not use a flat panel display. As for the front camera, this series should continue to use a punch-hole front camera. Since the under-display camera technology has not been well developed, at best, we may see a smaller punch-hole design on the Galaxy S11 series. The Samsung Galaxy S11 series will be the first Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 smartphone to go into mass-production.</p>
