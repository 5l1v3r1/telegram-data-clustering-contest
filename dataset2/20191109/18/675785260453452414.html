      <p>Gemma Collins has big plans to land the next Bond Girl role.</p>
      <p>The GC, 38, expressed her interest in the sexy Hollywood part when she uploaded a clip of her partaking in an adventurous sport, in Dubai on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>In a fun clip, the former TOWIE star proved she was fearless when she raced around the desert while quad-biking during a romantic break with her on/off beau James Argent.</p>
      <p>The bubbly TV personality was every inch the go-getter and daredevil as she was clad in the helmet painted with luminous stripes.</p>

      <p>A natural on the telly, it's no wonder GC oozed confidence when she filmed the piece to camera from behind the wheel.</p>
      <p>She wrote: "Defo going to audition for the next BOND GIRL." (sic)</p>
      <p>Gemma, who continues to document her three stone weight loss, claimed she was ready to make history in the sexiest part in Hollywood.</p>
      <p>Bond 25 is the next movie in the spy franchise which is expected to hit cinemas in 2020 with Daniel Craig reprising the role of the spy.</p>

      <p>The reality star was delighted at the prospect of taking on the baton on from the likes of Ursula Andress, Honor Blackman and Eva Green.</p>
      <p>James whisked Gemma away to Dubai for a lovely break away to celebrate the couple getting their relationship back on track.</p>
      <p>It appeared the TOWIE lovebirds were done for good when Arg moved back to his mum's in October.</p>

      <p>The GC called 999 amid concerns for his welfare when he failed to return her calls.</p>
      <p>Gemma, who feared Arg had overdosed, was said to have decided to call it off for good over after the scare.</p>
      <p>But now things are well and truly back on track for the pair.</p>
      <p>Arg told <a href="https://www.ok.co.uk/celebrity-news/james-argent-overdose-gemma-collins-20730191">OK! magazine</a> : "Gemma loves me to death. She was seriously concerned because she couldn’t get hold of me, which I understand.</p>
      <p>"I didn’t have my phone on me because it was charging downstairs. I have put her through a lot so I completely understand her worry.</p>
      <p>"She remembers what she’s been through in the past with me so she thought the worst."</p>
