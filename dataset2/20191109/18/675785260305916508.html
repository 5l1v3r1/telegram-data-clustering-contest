      <h1>Accrington vs Crewe FA Cup clash left with one linesman after referee chaos</h1>
      <h2>There was confusion at half-time when it emerged that the replacement referee picked up an injury and, despite receiving medical treatment, was also unable to return to action</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T18:07:58+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 18:07</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>The FA Cup first-round clash between Accrington Stanley and Crewe Alexandra was sent into chaos after injuries to two referees left the encounter with just one linesman.</p>
      <p>The match at Accrington's Crown Ground on Saturday was held up in the 23th minute when referee Neil Hair was unable to continue officiating the match after picking up a knock.</p>
      <p>After a three-minute delay, Hair was replaced by one of his assistants and Crewe went into the break with a slender 1-0 lead thanks to Charlie Kirk's opener.</p>
      <p>But there was confusion at half-time when it emerged that the replacement referee picked up an injury and, despite receiving medical treatment, he was also unable to return to action.</p>

      <p>There was a delay to kick-off for the second half for over an hour, with fans waiting anxiously to discover whether the game would be called off.</p>
      <p>After a look at the FA Cup rulebook, it was then decided that the second half would go ahead with just one assistant and, in another bizarre turn of events, a coin toss would decide which line he would run.</p>
      <p>Crew tweeted: "We are going with 1 assistant and we will toss a coin to decide which line he runs! In the FA rules so we play. Kick off is 5.10pm... Crewe still lead 1-0 thanks to Kirkyâ€™s goal about 2 days ago..."</p>
      <p>After a delay of over an hour, the game eventually got back underway and Crewe doubled their lead through a Chris Porter penalty.</p>

      <p>Despite the unusual delay, the visitors' social media team seemed to see the funny side, posting a series of hilarious tweets.</p>
      <p>One read: "Maybe FA Cup sponsors Emirates should fly out all the supporters who have remained at the game to Dubai to warm up after the game finishes at midnight?"</p>
      <p>Crewe ultimately claimed a 2-0 win to book their place in the second round of the FA Cup.</p>
