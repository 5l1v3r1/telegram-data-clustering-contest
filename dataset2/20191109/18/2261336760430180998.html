      <p>Conor McGregor is keeping a close eye on tonight’s action at UFC Moscow, as the brash Irishman has already directed a series of scolding tweets (later deleted) towards Khabib Nurmagomedov’s cousin, Abubakar Nurmagomedov, following the Russian’s first-round submission loss to David Zawanda.</p>

      <p>“Nurmagotaptap,” McGregor posted to kick things off, knowing full well Khabib was in Abubakar’s corner.</p>

      <p>“He tapped his forehead.If you can tap his forehead. You can punch his forehead. He quit. 1 quitter exposed. Abubakar Nurmagotaptap. Forever a failure,” he commented in his final tweet.</p>
      <p>McGregor and Khabib have one of the most heated rivalries in the UFC and both men seem destined for a rematch. Nurmagomedov, the reigning lightweight champion, outclassed and submitted McGregor with a neck crank in the fourth round of their headlining championship bout at UFC 229, and ‘The Notorious’ hasn’t fought since.</p>
      <p>Nurmagomedov, who was fined and suspended for kicking off a post-fight brawl at UFC 229, has since gone on to defend his lightweight title against Dustin Poirier, whom he submitted earlier this year at UFC 242 in Abu Dhabi. Nurmagomedov’s next title defense is expected to be against top-ranked contender Tony Ferguson.</p>
      <p>McGregor, 31, is teased to return to the UFC against Donald ‘Cowboy’ Cerrone in January.</p>
