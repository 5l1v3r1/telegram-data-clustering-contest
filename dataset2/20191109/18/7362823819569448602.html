      <p>Two <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/travel/disney-world-heist-alleged-photos">Disney</a> employees and a retired middle school assistant principal have been snared in a Florida sheriff’s child pornography sting.</p>
      <p>Their arrests and the arrests of 14 other men were announced Friday by<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/florida-sheriff-on-border-crisis-after-major-drug-bust-it-makes-me-absolutely-crazy"> Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd</a> as part of an undercover probe into child pornography conducted by detectives who work on computer crime cases.</p>
      <p>Judd said the two arrested Disney employees were Brett Kinney, 40, of Lake Alfred, Fla., and Donald Durr, Jr., 52, of Davenport, Fla. He said the retired assistant principal was William Hage, 76 of Lakeland, Fla. The school where Hage worked was Seth McKeel Middle School in Lakeland.</p>

      <p>Kinney worked as a guest experience manager at Walt Disney World and had been employed at the theme park for 15 years, <a href="https://www.fox13news.com/news/deputies-arrest-17-child-pornography-suspects-14-sexual-predators-in-polk-county">Fox 13 Tampa</a> reported.</p>

      <p>Durr was also employed by Disney for over two decades on their maintenance staff, the station reported.</p>
      <p>Judd said Durr told deputies, "I'm a pervert but I'm not a monster," according to Fox 13.</p>
      <p>A representative for Disney said Kinney no longer works for the company and that Durr is on unpaid leave, the station reported.</p>
      <p>Judd said in a news release that Hage was on the internet chatting about wanting “to see a 15-year-old wearing something sexy” when detectives showed up at his house with a search warrant.</p>
