      <p>Meet Britain’s rarest rescue cat, who confounded the odds to be a MALE tortoiseshell.</p>
      <p>These feisty black and orange cats are female – as a rule.</p>
      <p>So little kitten Miracle gave RSPCA staff a real ­surprise when he was handed in.</p>
      <p>The charity’s Penny Skates said: “When the cattery staff at our ­re-homing centre told me we had a male tortoiseshell I just presumed they had made a mistake.</p>
      <p>“I explained to them you just can’t get a male tortie.</p>
      <p>“But when I did take a look at him, it was clear we had a little boy and not a girl.</p>

      <p>“I have worked with animals for more than 40 years and through my work at the charity I’ve seen hundreds if not thousands of kittens and not one has ever been a male tortoiseshell.</p>
      <p>“He’s caused quite a stir at our ­centre because no one has ever seen a male tortie before. We have named him Miracle ­because to us he really is a kitten out of the ordinary.”</p>
      <p>Male cats, like human males, have only one X chromosome in their DNA so they should be unable to inherit the different colour genes that make up the tortie colouring.</p>
      <p>There are almost 11 million pet cats in the UK.</p>
      <p>And according to research, only one in every 3,000 tortoiseshell kittens is born male.</p>
      <p>So whenever one is born it is a rare event.</p>
      <p>Miracle and his brother Shadow had been taken to the Eau Brink Rehoming Centre in Norfolk by their owner.</p>

      <p>Penny, who is chairman of the ­charity’s Norfolk West branch trustees, added: “Miracle really is a ­gorgeous little character.</p>
      <p>“He absolutely adores his brother Shadow so when we do look to rehome they will be rehomed ­together because they are inseparable.”</p>
      <p>Male tortoiseshells are caused ­because of an extra gene being present. They are usually sterile and can have health problems.</p>
      <p>They are viewed as lucky in many countries. In America, torties are sometimes referred to as money cats.</p>
