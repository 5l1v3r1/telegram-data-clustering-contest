      <p>Callum McFadzean grabbed the all-important goal as Plymouth Argyle won 1-0 away to Bolton Wanderers in the FA Cup first round.</p>
      <p>Ryan Lowe’s Pilgrims produced one of their best defensive displays of the season as they came out on top at the University of Bolton Stadium.</p>
      <p>Goalkeeper Alex Palmer was rarely tested by Bolton as Argyle secured their passage into round two.</p>
      <p>They will find out their opponents when the draw takes place on Monday night, televised live on BBC Two.</p>
      <p>Argyle came under pressure from Bolton at the start of the first round tie, with Joe Dodoo and Chris O’Grady both having shots off target.</p>
      <p>But the Pilgrims then opened the scoring from their first attack of the match in the 11th minute.</p>
      <p>McFadzean linked up well with Danny Mayor, who was recalled to the starting line-up after playing as a substitute in the previous two games.</p>
      <p>Mayor broke into the Bolton box and cut the ball inside where McFadzean drilled a left-foot shot into the net off the underside of the crossbar.</p>
      <p>Argyle played with a lot of confidence after McFadzean’s fifth goal of the season and had three good chances to extend their advantage before the half hour mark.</p>
      <p>Former Pilgrims’ loan signing Remi Matthews made fine diving saves from Mayor and Joel Grant.</p>
      <p>Then, in the 29th minute, Byron Moore latched onto a loose ball after Bolton’s Daryl Murphy gave it it away.</p>
      <p>Moore was one-on-one with Matthews as he sped forward but could not come up with the finish as the ‘keeper spread himself to make an important save.</p>

      <p>Bolton improved as half-time approached and Palmer had to make stops from Luke Murphy and Dodoo.</p>
      <p>Wanderers also had loud penalty appeals waved away by referee Rob Lewis in the 42nd minute when they felt Josh Grant had handled the ball.</p>
      <p>Grant, usually a defender, was deployed in a midfield holding role for this match, with Joe Edwards at right wing-back because of an arm injury to Joe Riley.</p>
      <p>Dodoo had an opportunity to equalise early in the second half when he hammered the ball down into the ground and towards goal, but Palmer reacted sharply and touched it wide.</p>
      <p>Argyle came under a period of pressure from Bolton, who put a number of crosses into their penalty area intended for Daryl Murphy and O’Grady, but the visitors held firm.</p>
      <p>Then, just past the hour mark, the Pilgrims had a good attack of their own which ended with Edwards setting up defender Scott Wootton for a shot which was not far off target.</p>

      <p>Bolton boss Keith Hill used all three of his permitted substitutes as Argyle continued to frustrate the home side.</p>
      <p>There was even a spell where the Pilgrims forced five corners in succession, which did not lead to any scoring chances for them but took all of the attacking momentum out of Bolton.</p>
      <p>Striker Dom Telford made his comeback from a hamstring injury as a stoppage time substitute as Argyle held onto their lead without any more alarms.</p>
