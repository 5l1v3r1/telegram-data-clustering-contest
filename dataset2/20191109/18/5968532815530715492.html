      <p>Too many <b>modern speakers look so boring</b>. Everything is either a box, a tube, or a weird cone shape. Why not grab a functional and futuristic <a href="http://andauth.co/NebulaSpeaker">Nebula Levitating Speaker</a> for <a href="http://andauth.co/NebulaSpeaker">$140</a> and leave those boring cubes behind?</p>
      <p>The <a href="http://andauth.co/NebulaSpeaker">Nebula</a> looks like the Death Star if you surrounded it with the ring from Halo. Don’t even tell me that you can find a cooler looking <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-bluetooth-speakers-533296/">speaker</a>. There’s even a <b>built-in microphone</b> for you to take phone calls completely hands-free. You might not have a floating car like the Jetsons, but you can <b>feel like you’re zooming into the future</b>.</p>
      <blockquote>Project crisp 360-degree surround sound.</blockquote>
      <p>A futuristic <a href="http://andauth.co/NebulaSpeaker">speaker</a> like this just wouldn’t be the same if you had to connect your phone with a wire.

You can relax, read a book, and enjoy a soft, soothing glow. When you’re ready to turn in for the night, pop on your soothing sounds and let <a href="http://andauth.co/NebulaSpeaker">Nebula</a> double as a <b>calm nightlight</b>.</p>
