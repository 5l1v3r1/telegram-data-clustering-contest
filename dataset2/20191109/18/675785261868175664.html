      <h2>About 700 people in Fishlake, north of Doncaster, in South Yorkshire were told to get out of their homes after the River Don burst its banks and peaked at a record 21ft</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T18:33:15+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 18:33</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Kitching, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/chris-kitching/, Ashley Pemberton, Dominica Sanda</a></address>
      <p>An entire village in South Yorkshire has been evacuated amid record flooding and seven "danger to life" warnings along the same river.</p>
      <p>About 700 people in Fishlake, north of Doncaster, were told to leave their homes for their own safety after the River Don burst its banks and hit its highest level ever recorded.</p>
      <p>By then homes were already under 400ft of water and stranded residents were being rescued by firefighters in boats.</p>
      <p>The river, which flows through Sheffield, Rotherham and Doncaster, peaked at just over 6.3 metres (21ft) on Friday, higher than levels seen during a catastrophic flood in 2007.</p>

      <p>Firefighters have rescued more than 180 people across the county since Thursday and Friday, when more than a month's worth of rain fell in 24 hours.</p>
      <p>Housing Minister Robert Jenrick said the Government would trigger its emergency Bellwin scheme to fund the cost of tackling floods in Yorkshire, Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire.</p>
      <p>Seven severe flood warnings were in place along the River Don - at Barnby Dun, Bentley, Fishlake, Kirk Bramwith, Kirk Sandall, South Bramwith and Willow Bridge Caravan Site - as of Saturday evening.</p>
      <p>The Environment Agency had also issued 57 warnings - mostly in Yorkshire and the Midlands - where flooding was expected and "immediate action" was required.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>There were 85 flood alerts, meaning flooding is possible, across England.</p>
      <p>Doncaster Council urged the entire population of Fishlake, where there are around 200 houses, to flee for their own safety as the region was ravaged by the worsts floods in decades.</p>
      <p>Some residents were angry that they did not receive a warning from the authorities until after their homes were flooded.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the Environment Agency said 1,600 people have been evacuated from 1,200 houses across Yorkshire so far.</p>

      <p>He added that at least 300 houses have been flooded and a multi-agency rescue effort is in place.</p>
      <p>Linda Bushell, who lives in Fishlake with her son Paul Sims, fled her house at around 11pm on Friday and stayed in the nearby Hare and Hounds pub, which is on higher ground.</p>
      <p>She frantically rushed to move valuables and clothes upstairs after seeing water flood into the village.</p>
      <p>Her three-bedroom semi, which she has lived in for 32 years, is under 4ft of water and she has no idea when she can return.</p>

      <p>Linda, 52, said: "My son came running downstairs saying something was going on. I went outside and saw all the roads were flooded. It was up to my knees.</p>
      <p>"I just managed to get everything upstairs and get out of the house. We got out as quickly as we could and stayed in the pub last night.</p>
      <p>"I have no idea when I can return to my house.</p>
      <p>"My son went back last night to check on it but he said it is under at least 4ft of water.</p>

      <p>"It's probably a mess, my main priority is getting back as soon as I can to see what mess it is in. Luckily, I am insured, but it will take a long time to clean up."</p>
      <p>Linda claims there was a lack of communication from the authorities as she only got a flood warning text after her house was submerged.</p>
      <p>She added: "I'm still in shock, I didn't think something like this would ever happen.</p>
      <p>"I'm also angry because we didn't get any warning. This could have been avoided yesterday.</p>

      <p>"The council knew about this yesterday afternoon. Why didn't they do something about it then?</p>
      <p>"I got a text from the Environment Agency saying I was at risk of flooding after my house had already flooded."</p>
      <p>Linda was expecting to stay at the pub again on Saturday night as she has nowhere else to go.</p>
      <p>She said: "It's the highest point in the village. People are either staying here or at the church."</p>

      <p>Wendy Brownbridge, a church warden at St. Cuthbert's in Fishlake, is helping to get aid to villagers affected by the flooding.</p>
      <p>Locals have donated supplies to the village, which has been cut off as roads in and out of it have been left impassable.</p>
      <p>Tractors have been used to drop off blankets, sleeping bags and food at the church, where some stranded residents slept last night after being told to leave their homes.</p>
      <p>Ms Brownbridge said: "A lot of people stayed here last night.</p>

      <p>"We're not expecting any more rain, but because there is still flood warnings, people have been told to get out.</p>
      <p>"People are very worried, about 20 homes have been flooded and it is very hard to see your possessions under water.</p>
      <p>"Environment Agency officers were asking people if they wanted to go and offered them help if they did."</p>
      <p>South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue service has three boats operating in the village to help people flee to safety.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Doncaster Council said: "Due to the rate of rising water in the Trundle Lane area, a decision has been made to issue a severe flood warning in Fishlake.</p>

      <p>"Residents in the area are advised to evacuate their property and are being supported to do so."</p>
      <p>Mayor of Doncaster, Ros Jones, said: "South Yorkshire has just seen one of the wettest days on record and as a result we have severe flood warnings in place in Kirk Bramwith, South Bramwith, Kirk Sandall, Willow Bridge, Barnby Dun and Bentley.</p>
      <p>"We are working with our partners and closely monitoring the situation. Some residents have already been evacuated and we have set up rest centres where we are providing support and advice."</p>
      <p>A woman who died after being swept away in floodwater has been named as Annie Hall, the former High Sheriff of Derbyshire.</p>
      <p>She was swept away in the rain-swollen and debris-filled River Derwent in Rowsley and her body was recovered about two miles away in Darley Dale, near Matlock.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Labour Party leader <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> called for better flood management ahead of a visit to deluged communities.</p>
      <p>During a visit to Leeds on Saturday, Mr Corbyn said better upstream river management and flood defences in towns were needed and called for more funding for emergency services.</p>
      <p>"Obviously we need much better flood management and prevention schemes," he said.</p>
      <p>"It also means properly funding our fire and rescue services and properly funding our Environment Agency to deal with this.</p>
      <p>"The Environment Agency has lost a fifth of its staff, the fire services have lost more than a fifth of their staff. They're struggling to cope with this."</p>
      <p>The Labour leader said the UK could expect more extreme <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> due to climate change.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn was due to visit flood-hit areas of South Yorkshire on Saturday.</p>
