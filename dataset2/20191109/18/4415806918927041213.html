      <p>A British soldier badly injured in an IRA bus attack has paid tribute to those who helped him, as he revisited the scene for the first time.</p>
      <p>Eight servicemen were killed in the Ballygawley bombing in Co Tyrone in 1988.</p>
      <p>Members of the Light Infantry Regiment, from England, were returning to a base near Omagh after a short holiday.</p>
      <p>Dave Hardy was among the 28 injured, and he suffered broken bones and a brain injury.</p>
      <p>On the eve of Remembrance Sunday, a special gathering was held in Omagh.</p>
      <p>Mr Hardy said: “I am asking questions and getting answers that I have never been able to get before, like how did I get to hospital.</p>
      <p>“I am very happy that I was not alone.”</p>
      <blockquote>Someone walked out and said everything is going to be okay</blockquote>
      <p>The IRA set off a 200-pound roadside Semtex bomb as the bus was travelling between Ballygawley and Omagh.</p>
      <p>Members of the Omagh Protestant Boys Band returning from a parade were among the first at the scene and tried to resuscitate soldiers, who were lying on the road.</p>
      <p>Mr Hardy, 53, from Durham, was trying to sleep on the bus and the first thing the then private remembers is lying on the road unable to get up, but no pain.</p>
      <p>He added: “I heard crying, it was the horrible, stomach-wrenching cry of pain.”</p>
      <p>He was in hospital in a coma for a month or more and underwent rehabilitation in Surrey before being medically discharged from the Army.</p>
      <p>He said he had been suppressing emotion associated with the attack.</p>
      <p>“It is a weird sensation, there is no emotion, I think it could be just a defence mechanism.”</p>
      <p>Members of the public, including nearby residents and two flute bands who were travelling on the road, comforted the wounded until emergency services arrived.</p>
      <p>Mr Hardy was taken to hospital in nearby Dungannon in one of the first ambulances.</p>
      <p>He recalled seeing a bright light.</p>
      <p>“Someone walked out and said everything is going to be okay.”</p>
