      <h2>Even the stars in the audience at the Pride of Britain Awards were battling their tear ducts to save their ­immaculate ­make-up</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T18:13:20+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 18:13</time> by <a rel="author">Sara Wallis, https://www.facebook.com/SaraWallisMirror/</a></address>
      <p>From the moment 11-year-old Corrie ­superfan Dante started body popping with Ashley Banjo, right through to Emili Sandé singing out the show, the Daily Mirror’s Pride of Britain had me in a state.</p>
      <p>The two-hour ITV event is always a bit like running an emotional marathon. But this 20th anniversary ceremony broke me at around the four-minute mark – and didn’t let up.</p>
      <p>It was one astonishing story after ­another.</p>
      <p>Each an example of unbelievable heroics, courage or dedication.</p>
      <p>Each with a heart-wrenching video or dramatic ­reconstruction.</p>
      <p>Each ending with the ­winner’s celebrity favourite surprising the bejeezus out of them – and another ­mascara stain down my puffy red cheeks.</p>
      <p>When Dante realised the man inside the Corrie mascot was Jack P Shepherd, aka David Platt, his idol, it was telly joy.</p>

      <p>The unsung heroes become the stars at Pride of Britain, with the celebs further down the pecking order for once.</p>
      <p>Actors, singers and footballers forced to acknowledge that kicking a ball about isn’t quite as heroic as say... pulling three people from a burning plane wreckage.</p>
      <p>Yes, winners Daniel Nicholson and Joel Snarr did actually do that, rescuing the survivors just seconds before it exploded.</p>
      <p>It sounded like a disaster movie.</p>
      <p>Nine-year-old schoolboy Ben Hedger won a Child of Courage award for steering his mum’s car across a dual ­carriageway when she collapsed at the wheel doing 65mph. “The car was getting faster each ­second,” he said.</p>

      <p>Jaydee-Lee Dummett, seven, saved her entire family by raising the alarm after spotting signs of carbon monoxide ­poisoning.</p>
      <p>And Avengers fan Aaron Hunter, who is nine, recruited Robert Downey Jr to fundraise in the hope of finding a cure for his rare terminal ­condition Rohhad ­syndrome, raising more than £300,000.</p>
      <p>Stars in the audience were battling their tear ducts to save their ­immaculate ­make-up. Lots of stoic blinking going on.</p>
      <p>Of course the famous faces need to be given a bit of credit for some golden TV moments.</p>

      <p>Craig Revel Horwood broke character to give Makaton founder Margaret Walker a smile, thumbs up and a “Fab-U-Lous”. He’ll need to lie down after that.</p>
      <p>Ant and Dec popped up behind two newspapers to give Jaydee-Lee the shock of her life.</p>
      <p>Janet Jackson made the Lifetime Achievement winner gasp out loud, while Liam Payne made little Ben burst into tears of happiness.</p>
      <p>Inspiring – and not remotely connected to Brexit – this was a welcome dose of perspective and human kindness.</p>
