      <p>George Horne crossed for two first-half tries as <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/glasgow">Glasgow</a> eased to a 31-7 Guinness PRO14 victory over <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/zebre">Zebre</a> at Stadio Sergio Lanfranchi.</p>
      <p>Scotland scrum-half Horne dived over for the opening score after 13 minutes, with <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/scotland/players/adam-hastings/">Adam Hastings</a> adding the conversion in Parma, and he completed his double nine minutes later after he was set up by Ratu Tagive.</p>
      <p>Hastings added a third try three minutes before the break which he converted himself to make it 19-0 at half-time.</p>
      <p>The Warriors extended their lead six minutes into the second period as Tagive touched down to clinch the bonus point, but the home side, despite losing <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/zebre/players/johan-meyer/">Johan Meyer</a> to a red card, fought back with a try from replacement Pierre Bruno just before the hour as <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/italy/players/carlo-canna/">Carlo Canna</a> added the extras.</p>
