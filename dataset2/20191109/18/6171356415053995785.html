      <h1>Get a US unlocked Galaxy S9+ for just $480 ($120 off)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T18:01:25+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 18:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/corbin-davenport/" target="_blank">Corbin Davenport</a></address>
      <p>The Galaxy S11 is only a few months away, but the S10 is still an excellent phone. The S9 is also still hanging in there, especially since <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-is-already-testing-the-galaxy-s9-with-android-10/">it will probably get Android 10 at some point</a>. Now you can get the United States version of the S9+ for just $474.99 from Amazon, a $120 savings from the usual price of ~$600.</p>
      <p>The model on sale has a Snapdragon 845 processor, 6GB of RAM, 64GB of internal storage (there's a microSD card slot for expansion), a 6.2-inch 1440x2960 AMOLED screen with HDR10 support, an IP68 water/dust resistance. There are two 12MP rear cameras (one wide, one telephoto), and an 8MP shooter on the front. It was updated to Android 9 Pie <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/02/18/android-9-pie-is-rolling-out-now-to-unlocked-samsung-galaxy-s9-devices/">earlier this year</a>.</p>

      <p>Unlike most of the deals we see on Samsung phones, this one is for the United States version of the S9+, not an international variant. That means you get Samsung's full warranty, support for all major networks in the US, and full Samsung Pay functionality.</p>
