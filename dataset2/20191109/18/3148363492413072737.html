      <h1>Nolte: 'Midway' Stomps Stephen King, All-Girl 'Terminator' at Box Office | Breitbart</h1>
      <h2>Midway, the old-fashioned, pro-American war movie critics dismissed and the experts said no one would see, is beating the latest horror movie from far-left novelist Stephen King.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T18:53:17+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 18:53</time> by <a rel="author">John Nolte</a></address>
      <p>With a dismal 40 percent Rotten Tomatoes’ score, director Roland Emmerich’s <i>Midway,</i> the story of the epic WWII battle that changed the course of the war against the Japanese in the Pacific, was projected to <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/article/ed3798991876/?ref_=bo_hm_hp">crash</a> into fourth place behind King’s <i>Shining</i> sequel, <i>Doctor Sleep, </i>along with <i>Last Christmas</i> and <i>Terminator: Dark Fate.</i></p>
      <p><i>Doctor Sleep</i> slipped into 3,855 theaters with a solid 73 percent Rotten Tomatoes’ score and a projected opening windfall of $27 million. The woke romantic comedy <i>Last Christmas</i> opened in 3,448 theaters with a $15 million projection. <i>Terminator: Dark Fate</i> is still in 4,086  theaters, and was looking at a second-weekend haul of  $13.4.</p>
      <p><i>Midway</i> only opened in 3,242 theaters with a projected debut of just $13 million.</p>
      <p>And yet, even though it’s playing in 600 few theaters than <i>Doctor Sleep</i>, 200 fewer than <i>Last Christmas</i> (which looks excruciatingly awful), and 800 fewer than the all-girl <i>Terminator,</i> <i>Midway</i> is now projected to beat them all and land in the weekend’s top spot.</p>
      <p>The far-left Deadline <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/doctor-sleep-midway-last-christmas-opening-weekend-box-office-1202780077/">reports</a> that <i>Midway</i> over-performed bigtime with a $19.2 million opening, while King’s <i>Doctor Sleep</i> nosedived with an abysmal $17.2 million.</p>
      <p><i>Last Christmas</i> and the all-girl <i>Terminator</i> also came slightly in below projections.</p>
      <p>With the exception of chapters one and two of <i>It,</i> which were both smashes, King’s box office record has been pretty awful over the last few years. Even with stars Samuel L. Jackson and John Cusack, <i>Cell </i>(2016) died an ignoble death on 15 screens and a $1.3 million total global haul The big-budget <i>Dark Tower</i> (2017) drowned in red ink with its abysmal $113 million global haul. This year’s <i>Pet Sematary</i> grossed just $55 million domestic, which is less than the $57.5 million the original grossed thirty years ago — and that is dollar-to-dollar ignoring inflation.</p>
      <p>And now <i>Doctor Sleep</i>, which cost $60 million produce and at least as much to promote, is dead in the water with an abysmal opening, especially when you are talking about a sequel to one of the most cherished horror movies of all time.</p>
      <p>For more than 20 years, King could almost do no wrong at the movies: <i>Carrie </i>(1976), <i>The Shining</i> (1980), <i>Creepshow</i> (1982), <i>Cujo</i> (1983), <i>The Dead Zone</i> (1983), <i>Christine</i> (1983), <i>Children of the Corn</i> (1984), <i>Silver Bullet</i> (1985), <i>Stand By Me</i> (1986), <i>The Running Man</i> (1987), <i>Pet Sematary </i>(1989), <i>Misery </i>(1990), <i>Shawshank Redemption</i> (1994), <i>The Green Mile</i> (1999).  I’ll even defend <i>Needful Things</i> (1993), <i>Creepshow 2</i> (1987), and  <i>Maximum Overdrive</i> (1986).</p>
      <p>Over these last 20 years, though, there have been a whole lot more misses than hits.</p>
      <p>As far as <i>Terminator: Dark Fate</i>, that sucker is doornail dead with a 59 percent crash over its opening weekend, which is especially tragic when your opening weekend stinks. Weekend two only added $12 million to<i> Dark Fate’s</i> tally, which means that after ten days it sits at a catastrophic $49 million domestic.</p>
      <p><i>Dark Fate</i> will need to hit somewhere between $500 and $600 million just to break even, and by Monday it will probably not be over $160 million worldwide.</p>
      <p>They brought back James Cameron. They brought back Linda Hamilton. America’s butt-kissing critics got in line to award it mostly positive reviews. But if it walks like a social justice lecture, you know it’s going to talk like a social justice lecture, and <i>Dark Fate</i> is now doomed to be one of the biggest flops in Hollywood history.</p>
      <p>You know, it’s weird how woke movies like <i>Dark Fate, Men in Black: International, Stuber, Late Night, Booksmart, Long Shot, The Hustle</i>, the all-girl <i>Ghostbusters, Vice, Wrinkle in Time</i>, and the like, continue to flame out and flop, while titles that appeal to Middle America — <i>Midway, Angel Has Fallen, Unplanned, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, The Mule, John Wick, Overcomer</i>, etc., continue to <i>surprise</i> the so-called experts.</p>
      <p>And by “weird,” I mean not weird at all.</p>
