      <h1>Strictly's Kelvin Fletcher has a secret dance past as he emerges as favourite to win</h1>
      <h2>The former Emmerdale star has revaled his gruelling training regime</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T18:40:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 18:40</time> by <a rel="author">Jane Lavender, Louise Randell, Will Trigger, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/louise-randell/</a></address>
      <p>Former Emmerdale star Kelvin Fletcher has wowed judges and fans with his slick dance floor moves.</p>
      <p>The 35-year-old is now one of the favourites to walk away with the Glitterball trophy.</p>
      <p>Kelvin has been pushing himself to the limit in his bid for victory with 5am work-outs and 12 hour training sessions with partner Oti Mabuse.</p>
      <p>The actor has also increased his calories intake to 3,000 a day and makes sure he drinks up to four litres of water a day.</p>
      <p>Kelvin said: ""I’m on my feet all day. It’s quite tiring, so I’ve always been quite pro carbs – I think they’re a great thing. I probably eat about 300-350g of carbs a day.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>"About 160g of protein, about 60-80g of fat, which I think is about 2,500-3,000 calories.</p>
      <p>"Carbs get a bad press, but they’re pretty important. I’ve stayed pretty lean, I’m about five kilos lighter than I was a couple of months ago.</p>
      <p>"Which is fine, I think – it helps with the dancing."</p>
      <p>Kelvin is taught his dance moves on Monday and he makes sure he knows the routine by Tuesday lunch time so he and Oti can spend the rest of the week perfecting it.</p>
      <p>And it's certainly been paying off with he and Oti regularly close to the top of the leaderboard.</p>

      <p>Kelvin's revealing outfits and hunky shape have also won him a legion of new fans.</p>
      <p>But it's now emerged that the dad-of-two has a secret dance past.</p>
      <p>Before his starring role in Emmerdale, Kelvin was a regular at ballet classes from the age of eight.</p>
      <p>Kelvin, who played Andy Sugden in the ITV soap, says he was bullied as a child because he took dance lessons.</p>
      <p>He told Attitude Magazine: "I was eight years old and was playing for my local rugby club.</p>
      <p>"I was having trials for my town team, but Tuesday I was doing 'good toes, naughty toes.'</p>
      <p>"I was always like that. I always liked dancing and you'd go to class and find you had an hour acting and an hour of ballet.</p>
      <p>"I didn't mind the poofter jibes."</p>
      <p>Kelvin was a late replacement in the BBC competition after Made In Chelsea's Jamie Laing suffered a foot injury.</p>
