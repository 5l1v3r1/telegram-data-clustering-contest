      </p>
      <p>An own goal from Ntsikelelo Nyauza and further goals from Leonardo Castro and Daniel Cardoso guided Chiefs to a 3-2 win over their Soweto rivals on Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>While the encounter was entertaining one to watch, Mokwena was livid with some of Chiefs' antics and claimed Erick Mathoho was right to be sent off.</p>
      <p>"It's a good game of football, it had everything, both teams going at each other, we didn't start very well when we made a mistake and conceded an own goal but we were strong to come back and we showed a little bit of strong character after that but another lapse of concentration and then a set-piece goal," Mokwena told SuperSport TV after the game.</p>
      <p>"We dug deep, scored one just before half-time but before that we hit the crossbar and the upright, we created so many chances, you can only be proud of these Orlando Pirates players," he continued.</p>
      <p>"But having said that, I'm extremely disappointed as a football lover that such a great spectacle is ruined by such thuggish behaviour! It's okay to lose, OK let's lose but don't punch my players! I've got players that were kicked, punched in the face, I mean what do you say about these things. It's thuggish behaviour!</p>
      <p>"I mean how do we have such coaches that condone such behaviour and carry [out] such behaviour!? I mean we can't have such things! Everybody is watching this, this is broadcast world wide, it's two of the biggest teams in the country and they play very good football and then we have coaches that encourages players to punch, foul and kick and be thugs on the pitch, it can't be!</p>
      <p>"We're proud of them, we never give up, we fight and the Buccanners I'm sure are proud of their players because their players fight, but we try to make things difficult, we've gotta learn...I've said to them at half-time when we were 2-0 down [2-1] that, "game on! Now we will see the real Pirates". And true to what I said, they gave us a spectacle. But we have to learn from these things and not wait to come back into games, we''ve got to take the lead and initiate the play a little bit more."</p>
