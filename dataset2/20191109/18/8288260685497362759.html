      <h1>'Very friendly' - West Brom boss Slaven Bilic confronts a Hull City fan and other things you missed</h1>
      <h2>An eagle-eyed (or rather Throstle-eyed) Joseph Chapman was paying close attention at the KCOM Stadium</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T18:32:43+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 18:32</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Chapman, https://www.facebook.com/josephchapmanBM/</a></address>
      <p>Jake Livermore’s scorching drive was enough to keep <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">West Bromwich Albion</a> top of the league after a hard fought 1-0 win at Hull City.</p>
      <p>On his return to the KCOM Stadium, where he made more than 140 appearances in the Premier League and Championship - and got a warm reception from the home faithful - Livermore found the net to break the deadlock in what - until that point - had been a rather scrappy game, devoid of many clear cut openings.</p>
      <p>Matt Phillips took a quick, short corner to Matheus Pereira, who in turn rolled it to the Albion captain on the edge of the box. He took one touch to get it out of his feet before unleashing a rocket of a shot that George Long couldn’t hope to get near to.</p>
      <p>Hull came out in the second half, having introduced Tom Eaves, and clearly with the intention of picking up the pace.</p>

      <p>Albion killed that tempo, which lasted for around 10 or 15 minutes, and began to dictate things once more.</p>
      <p>A couple of quite brilliant passages of play from the boys in purple almost ended in goal of the season contenders for Grady Diangana and Pereira.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, though, a goal was enough. It just so happened that, as the cliche goes, it was a goal worthy of winning any game.</p>
      <p>They will entertain Sheffield Wednesday, though, without both Livermore and Romaine Sawyers - both picked up their fifth bookings of the season and will serve a one-match suspension.</p>
      <p>Albion remain top heading into the next international break.</p>

      <p>As the half-time whistle blew, and with Albion leading, the players as usual routinely made their way down the tunnel for the break.</p>
      <p>Bilic would eventually, but not before heading around the back of his dug-out and opening a conversation with a Hull fan.</p>
      <p>Both individuals appeared quite animated, certainly from the lofty view of the press box. All the while, there was an eagle eyed steward keeping an eye on proceedings.</p>

      <p>It seems that Bilic had picked up on whatever the Hull fan had been shouting throughout the course of the first period and confronted him. After a couple of moments, the pair appeared to agree on disagreeing and went their separate ways.</p>
      <p>When Bilic was asked about the incident after the match, he replied: "It was just very very friendly, very friendly. At least on my side!"</p>
      <h3>New get-up</h3>

      <h3> </h3>
      <p>Not *technically* something you missed - how could you, look at it!</p>
      <p>Albion flaunted their third kit for the first time at the KCOM.</p>
      <p>The vivid purple and white strip has divided opinion amongst the fanbase, with many taking to it while others offered an emphatic thumbs down.</p>
      <p>With the traditional blue and white at home and the fan favourite yellow and green offering on the road, Albion supporters have enjoyed a return to tradition in recent times.</p>
      <p>This purple number, however, is the furthest thing from traditional, but at least there could be no mistaking which team was which!</p>
      <h3>Not too popular</h3>

      <h3> </h3>
      <p>This was the first match that Hull’s infamous owners, the Allam family, had been in attendance at a home game for around four years.</p>
      <p>The relationship between the ownership and the Tigers fanbase is well documented for being a strained one; the Allams have certainly made some unpopular decisions since taking over in 2010 (a period that has seen Premier League football) and various offers and discounts have struggled to tempt back many who have stayed away.</p>
      <p>There were a few chants throughout the course of the afternoon aimed at the owners, who probably are expecting it by this stage.</p>
      <h3>Fond memories</h3>

      <h3> </h3>
      <p>For two of Albion’s starting line-up, this was a fixture that they’d have picked out before the season even began.</p>
      <p>Jake Livermore and Conor Townsend both spent time with the Tigers before their career paths led them to The Hawthorns.</p>
      <p>Indeed for Townsend, this was a case of proving a point - let go without making a league appearance three years ago, the Hessle born lad was making his return to the club who had nurtured him throughout his academy years.</p>
      <p>Albion captain Livermore, on the other hand, has plenty of first-team experience - he made almost 150 appearances for Hull and helped them win promotion before joining Albion for £10m in January 2017.</p>
      <p>Livermore receiving a rousing reception, while Townsend’s was a little more polite.</p>
      <p>The former of course would find the net from range and decided against celebrating out of respect.</p>
      <h3>Sign of winter?</h3>
      <p>You know it’s quite nippy outdoors when Slaven Bilic is wearing a coat.</p>
      <p>The Croat is usually a man who is well dressed, with trendy trainers to match a match-day suit.</p>
      <p>We’ve seen him wear woolly hats, but here - in the north east of England, as we prepare for the frosty nights to come - even Bilic had to wrap up, when normally a suit would do.</p>
