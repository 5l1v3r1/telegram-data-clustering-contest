      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T18:37:18+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 18:37</time> by <a rel="author">Record Sport Online</a></address>
      <p>Harry Kewell admits he is interested in taking over at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a> after watching them batter St Johnstone at McDiarmid Park.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> and Leeds star had previously suggested he was only at the game as a 'friend of a friend' but has now confirmed he would take the job.</p>
      <p>Kewell has been out of work since leaving Notts County after 14 games and just three wins in that time. He also had a spell in charge of Crawley Town, winning 18 of his 57 games in charge.</p>
      <p>And now he fancies a crack at the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-premiership">Scottish Premiership</a> if he Hibs give him the opportunity to return to management.</p>
      <p>He said: “I’m sure I’m not the only one interested. It is a fantastic club with a fantastic set-up.</p>
      <p>“You do your research and you hear the players are full-on and hard working.</p>
      <p>“Of course it would be a cracking job but I’m sure there are hundreds of managers who would like this opportunity.</p>

      <p>“I go to games every week as I like to keep my eye in. I don’t mind watching games on television but I prefer to see it through my own eyes so I can get the full picture.</p>
      <p>“But I’m 100 per cent looking to get back into management. I love it, I enjoy it and it is something I feel very passionate about.</p>
      <p>“I enjoy coaching and I think that is where my strengths lie. It is something I want to be involved in again.”</p>
      <p>Kewell also admitted he regularly hears good things about Scottish football and the success of his former Anfield team-mate <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a> has piqued his interest.</p>
      <p>But he insists he hasn't spoken to the Rangers boss about a move to Scotland.</p>
      <p>He added: "I hear great things about the Scottish game. Steven [Gerrard] is here and he's doing really well.</p>
      <p>"I think Steven's got enough on his plate at the moment. He's doing a fantastic job at Rangers and they had a fantastic win on Thursday. As players and coaches you maybe speak a bit to get a bit of info here or there but you kind of let people do their own business."</p>
