      <h1>Egypt officials: 2 security forces killed in Sinai blast</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T18:48:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 18:48</time> by <a rel="author">Ashraf Sweillam, The Associated Press</a></address>
      <p>EL-ARISH, Egypt -- Egyptian officials said a roadside bomb has killed two members of the security forces on Saturday in the restive northern Sinai province.</p>
      <p>The explosion hit their armoured vehicle in Rafah, a town on the border with the Gaza Strip. Two other security force members were wounded.</p>
      <p>The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to talk to reporters.</p>
      <p>No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.</p>
      <p>Egypt has for years been battling an insurgency in northern Sinai that's now led by an Islamic State group affiliate.</p>
      <p>The fighting intensified in 2013 after the military overthrew the country's elected but divisive Islamist president.</p>
      <p>Last week, Egypt's military said at least 83 militants have been killed in the past five weeks in northern and central Sinai.</p>
      <p>Authorities heavily restrict access to the northern Sinai, making it difficult to verify claims related to the fighting.</p>
      <p>ISIS has carried out a number of large-scale attacks in recent years, mainly targeting security forces and Egypt's Christian minority.</p>
