      <h2>KSI and Logan Paul face off at the Staples Center in Los Angeles in the early hours of Sunday morning</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T18:00:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author">Aaron Flanagan, Martin Domin, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/aaron-flanagan/, https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfighting</a></address>
      <p>Two of the world's biggest social media stars clash in the ring tonight as KSI and Logan Paul meet in their long-awaited rematch.</p>
      <p>The YouTube stars, who have more than 40million followers between them, will bid to settle their rivalry at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>They fought to a controversial draw in Manchester last year and quickly agreed to a second fight.</p>
      <p>But it took the involvement of promoter Eddie Hearn for the two men to agree terms and they have also turned professional for tonight's clash, ditching the head guards and pulling on 10oz gloves.</p>
      <p>There are also plenty of big names on the undercard with world champions Billy Joe Saunders and Devin Haney in action.</p>
      <p>Here is everything you need to know about the fights...</p>
