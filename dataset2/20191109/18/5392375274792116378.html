      <p>Samsung <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/09/11/samsung-galaxy-a30s-a50s-landed-in-indian-market/">launched</a> the slightly upgraded versions of Galaxy A30 and Galaxy A50 in India before the Diwali festive season as Galaxy A30s and <a href="https://www.samsung.com/in/microsite/galaxya/a50s/">Galaxy A50s</a>. It has been only two months and the company has already dropped the prices of both the models.</p>
      <p>The Galaxy A30s comes only in one variant with 4GB RAM and 64GB internal storage. It was initially launched at ₹16,999 and now the price has been dropped by ₹1,000. And hence, interested people can now grab the Galaxy A30s for ₹15,999 which is still not a solid deal when comparing to other solid options such as Redmi Note 8 Pro and Realme XT.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, the Galaxy A50s is available in two variants in the country. At launch, the base 4GB + 128GB variant was priced at ₹22,999, whereas the second variant with 6GB + 128GB configuration was priced ₹24,999. Both of them have now received a price cut of ₹3,000 making their new effective price as ₹19,999 and ₹21,999 respectively. The Galaxy A50s does not have anything extraordinary when compared to its competitors like Redmi K20 but it comes with NFC for Samsung Pay which can be used at retailers across India.</p>
      <p>The new effective prices of Galaxy A30s and Galaxy A50s are already live on Samsung official online store and Flipkart.</p>
