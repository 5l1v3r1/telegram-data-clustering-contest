      <p>The Devon Derby drubbing by Exeter City a fortnight ago was not far from the mind of Ryan Lowe after Plymouth Argyle’s 1-0 FA Cup first round victory over Bolton Wanderers.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/plymouth-argyle">The Pilgrims </a>had played once since they lost 4-0 away to Exeter, but that was only a low-key EFL Trophy tie against Chelsea Under-21s.</p>
      <p>So the FA Cup clash at the University of Bolton Stadium, with more than 1,100 members of the Green Army making the trip, was the first proper chance for Argyle to make amends.</p>
      <p>They did so with a solid defensive display and an 11th minute goal from left wing-back Callum McFadzean.</p>
      <p>Argyle must now wait until Monday night for the second round draw, which will be televised on BBC Two from 7pm.</p>
      <p>Lowe said: “That win was for the fans because they have been through a bit of turmoil, as we know from a couple of weeks ago.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know how many was here - 1,100 or 1,200 – so absolutely fantastic and we thoroughly respect that.</p>
      <p>“They have come a long way, to our roots (in the north-west of England), but they have sung and rallied the lads through.</p>
      <p>“So that win was for them because they have probably had a disappointing two weeks but we are back on the bike and we will keep riding.”</p>
      <p>Lowe added: “We have all been a little bit hurting from the game at Exeter.</p>
      <p>“We jumped back on the bike and put in a solid performance, a good footballing performance and we are in the second round of the FA Cup.”</p>
      <p>Argyle could easily have been more than 1-0 up at half-time but found their former ‘keeper Remi Matthews in excellent form for League One bottom club Bolton.</p>

      <p>Matthews made fine diving saves from Danny Mayor and Joel Grant not long after McFadzean had opened the scoring.</p>
      <p>Then, shortly before the half-hour mark, Argyle striker Byron Moore broke clear of the Bolton defence but could not beat the Bolton ‘keeper in a one-on-one.</p>
      <p>Bolton applied pressure on the Pilgrims either side of half-time but, crucially, they held firm and then comfortably saw out the rest of the match.</p>
      <p>Lowe said: “We had to dig in at the start of the second half because they went from back to front quite quick to try and effect it.</p>
      <p>“Our lads withstood it, so I was pleased with that, but I thought the overall performance and the levels of the boys was fantastic.</p>
      <p>“We knew this was going to be a tough place to come and there is going to be no easy rides here for anyone in League One, but I thought the best team won today.”</p>
      <p>Lowe added: “We are always wanting to improve and I always keep saying that.</p>
      <p>“There were times when we were passing through the thirds, and through the lines, and you are looking a very good team.</p>
      <p>“Then we throw a sloppy pass in right through the middle and it gives them a chance to counter on you and it opens up a bit, which we don’t want.”</p>
      <p>McFadzean linked up with Mayor, as he so often does, in the build-up to his winning goal.</p>

      <p>After Mayor broke into the Bolton penalty area and played the ball inside, McFadzean drilled an unstoppable shot past Matthews, off the underside of the crossbar.</p>
      <p>Lowe said: “It was a great worked goal. We should have had another one – Byron probably should have scored.</p>
      <p>“We had a few ricochets at corners there which we have got to get our head on.”</p>
