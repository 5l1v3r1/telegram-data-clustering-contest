      <p>Xiaomi Mi MIX 4 and Mi 10 suggestions “received” by Xiaomi<br/>4.3 (86.67%) 6 votes</p>
      <p>With the <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/xiaomi">Xiaomi</a> CC9 Pro/Xiaomi Mi Note 10 released, Xiaomi fans are already looking forward to the next flagship. As of now, there is nothing concrete on Xiaomi’s next flagship. However, we can safely say that we are expecting the Xiaomi Mi 10 as well as the Xiaomi Mi MIX 4. Now, netizens are already making suggestions for these flagships and Xiaomi has “received” the suggestions.</p>

      <p>Today, a Xiaomi fan commented on Zhang Guoquan’s (director of Xiaomi’s system software department) Weibo post “Can Xiaomi Mi 10 and Mi MIX 4 display do something faster?”. This comment got huge positive reactions from netizens and  Zhang Guoquan himself had to reply “Received”.</p>
      <p>Currently, details about MIX 4 and Mi 10 are unknown. Nevertheless, XDA developers recently found evidence in the MIUI source code that Xiaomi is developing a 120Hz refresh rate phone. For now, the high refresh rate feature is for flagship models thus this phone could be the Mix 4 or Mi 10.</p>
      <p>Xiaomi CC9 Pro/Mi Note 10 already set the precedent. Thus, the Mi Note 10 and Mix 4 should also use a 108MP camera at least. In addition, Xiaomi did not launch the MIX series iteration model as usual. We only saw the Xiaomi Mi MIX Alpha. Thus, we may probably see the Xiaomi Mi MIX 4 arriving before the Xiaomi Mi 10. Recall that in 2018, Xiaomi Mi MIX 2S precedes Xiaomi Mi 8.</p>
