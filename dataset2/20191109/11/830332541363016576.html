      <p>TURKEY, Texas (CNN) - Another gender reveal stunt went horribly wrong and led to a recent plane crash in Texas, according to a National Transportation Safety Board <a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/brief.aspx?ev_id=20190908X51027">accident report</a> released Friday.</p>
