      <p>Kaizer Chiefs fans will see the return of one star player to the matchday squad against Orlando Pirates, but one key man has now officially been ruled out…</p>
      <p><b>Read: <a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/local/categories/kaizer-chiefs/kaizer-chief-s-erick-mathoho-has-spoken-about-the-soweto-derby/667101">Tower’s Back! – Rejuvenated Chiefs Star On His Soweto Derby Dream</a></b><br/><br/>Ernst Middendorp told the media earlier in the week that both Reeve Frosler and Kearyn Baccus would both be back available for selection to face the Buccaneers in today’s Soweto Derby, saying ‘definitely yes they will be available on Saturday as per information I got’.<br/><br/>But now, on the day of the game, the German has confirmed that Baccus will not be in contention to feature in his first competitive Soweto Derby, with the midfield man still battling to overcome the knee/ankle injury that he sustained last month.<br/><br/>A statement on the club’s official website today read, “We have still a few injury concerns… Kearyn Baccus is still out. We have Reeve Frosler back and available for selection. The mood in the camp is great and everybody is ready.”<br/><br/>Chiefs are also expected to welcome back the likes of Yagan Sasman, Khama Billiat, Erick Mathoho and Lebogang Manyama after they were rested for the 2-0 victory over Chippa United, with the Glamour Boys looking for their first league win over Bucs in several years.<br/><br/>The two sides lock horn at FNB Stadium at 15h30 today, with Chiefs eager to extend their lead at the top of the table.</p>
