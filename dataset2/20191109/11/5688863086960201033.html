        <b>Kerala Blasters FC head coach Eelco Schattorie denied rumours of a rift between him and fan-favourite Sahal and further went on to heap praise upon the player for his performance against Odisha on Friday. He also spoke highly of Prasanth and expressed his concerns about the growing list of injuries.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Before the Odisha game, Sahal Abdul Samad only played for 78 minutes despite being match fit and had also provided a brilliant assist to Rahul K P against Hyderabad FC. The last season's ISL emerging player then started in the eleven against Odisha and performed brilliantly with his skills at the midfield. However, Kerala Blasters could only manage a goalless draw.</p>
      <p>The passionate Kerala fans were not happy with the coach for not giving Sahal playtime and some even said the Dutchman dislikes him.  However, the coach denied such rumours and cleared the air. </p>
      <p>“One thing that really irritates me is that people think I don’t like Sahal. You have to be critical. He did fantastically today and step by step, we will get him where I want him. The first day I met him, I told him I am going to make you the best midfielder in India. So, the relationship between us is good. If I change him during matches, it’s for a reason and today he did brilliantly, and so did the rest,” Eelco Schattorie told at the post-match press conference, ISL website reported.</p>
      <p>The Dutchman also went onto support under fire youngster Prashant who after performances in the last games did well against Odisha. “Prasanth K didn’t do well last game but today he was fantastic. You need to give the youngsters time and not be so critical.” Schattorie added.</p>
      <p>At the 35th minute, Sahal did a brilliant run skipping past Odisha players with his amazing dribbling skills. However, Odisha defender <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/player/narayan_das">Narayan Das</a> fouled Sahal in the box which was a clear cut penalty, which the referee denied. Moreover, Schattorie went on to protest in the half time and was booked for his dissent.</p>
      <p>“Even if we forget about the penalty, I am very proud of the boys. Despite the setbacks we had this season, we did well. Jairo Rodrigues was playing with an injection. We had an injury to Messi upfront. Bartholomew Ogbeche, from yesterday morning 5 AM to the late evening, he was at the hospital. He had food poisoning and was completely dehydrated. If we look at the game today, I think we should have had a penalty, we had the better chances. I don’t think Odisha had even one chance. I am very happy with the point and proud of the team,” the Dutchman said.</p>
      <p>ISL will take a break for the International fixtures from November 11 to November 22,  which is a massive advantage for the injury-plagued side like Blasters. However, the Dutch coach stated that some injured players may take more than two weeks to recover. </p>
      <p>“Yes, but it is only two weeks. There are a few injuries which may take longer. There are a few issues and I am not trying to find excuses. We had good organization today, played with just two foreigners and played well. Yes, the break is welcome but at the same time it doesn’t solve all of them.” Scahttorie concluded</p>
