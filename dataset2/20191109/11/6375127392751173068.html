      <h3>NLEX seeks to secure the twice-to-beat advantage in the playoffs as it plays defending champion Magnolia today in the PBA Governors' Cup at the Ynares Center in Antipolo City.</h3>
      <p>Currently sitting on the top of the standings with a 7-1 record, the Road Warriors hope to sustain their impressive run in the season-ending tournament in the 6:45 p.m. duel with the Hotshots.</p>
      <p>Meralco guns for its fifth consecutive win as it takes on NorthPort in the 4:30 p.m. curtain raiser.</p>
      <p>With few games left in the elimination round, every team is looking to make  a push and have a higher ranking in the playoffs.</p>
      <p>NLEX won its fourth consecutive win at the expense of against Rain or Shine, 111-91, behind import Manny Harris' triple-double performance of 29 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists.</p>
      <p>Coach Yeng Guiao admitted that his Road Warriors never expected to enjoy this success right now.</p>
      <p>"We're right in the position where we want to be. We never dreamed about this. Even in our own dreams we never expected to become the number one team in this conference," said Guiao.</p>
      <p>"But we know that this is very fragile. A mistake could make everything fall apart. This is temporary and fragile. But I hope we can hold on to it as long as we can. What's important for us is to secure the top four.  </p>
      <p>We've never dreamed of being the top seed but if it's there. We'll take it." he added.</p>
      <p>Magnolia currently holds a 5-4 record with its latest win coming from the hands of Phoenix, 97-81.</p>
      <p>Coach Chito Victolero recognises the great challenge the Hotshots will have to overcome.</p>
      <p>"They're the number one team right now and they have a very good import. We'll try to stop him but their team is not just about their import. We have to stop the whole NLEX team." said Victolero.</p>
      <p>"They're very inspired right now. It's so hard play against them. Their big-men (JR) Quinahan and (Poy) Erram is playing very well. Especially their guards Kiefer (Ravena) and the others. I think it's a great match up for us." he added.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Bolts and the Batang Pier will go at it as both teams try to boost their respective playoff chances.</p>
      <p>Meralco is tied with idle TNT in second place at 7-2 , while NorthPort is eyeing to maintain its spot at No. 8 with a 3-5 record.</p>
