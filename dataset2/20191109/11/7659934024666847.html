      <p>Sudan's Popular Defense Forces (PDF) has threatened to set the country on fire in case authorities handed in ousted president Omar Bashir to the International Criminal Court (ICC).<br/><br/>PDF incited the army commanders to defend their ‘leader’ and to obstruct handing him to the Hague-based International Court of Justice (ICJ).<br/><br/>A statement by the PDF revealed that they don’t mind bringing Bashir to the court in the country once his incrimination is proved. It added that the history will witness that the loyal members of the armed forces disappointed their leader and didn’t protect him in case he was submitted to the Hague-court.<br/><br/>Following the ousting of Bashir on April 11, the demands to dissolve the popular defense forces mounted. However, the militants who became in charge under the Transitional Military Council didn’t issue a clear decision in this regard.<br/><br/>Spokesperson of the armed forces Brigadier General Amer Mohammed al-Hassan stated earlier that the Chiefs of Staff has formed a committee to look in the so-called ‘mobilized mujahideen’ and recruit individuals who wish to join the armed forces.<br/><br/>In this context, Hassan noted that the PDF is operating under the armed forces willingly.<br/><br/>However, the Forces of Freedom and Change demanded to hand in Bashir to the ICC. Also, the Hague-court renewed its request that the transitional government hands in Bashir because his presence in the prison is dangerous.<br/><br/>Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok pledged upon his visit to the refugees’ camps in the north of Darfur last week that he will respond to the victims’ wishes.<br/><br/>Notably, the court in the Hague issued two arrest warrants against Bashir in 2009 and 2010 for his alleged crimes in Darfur.</p>
