      <h1>Taxi driver's fury as he's given £70 parking fine 'while helping elderly woman'</h1>
      <h2>Nigel Cooke claims the parking warden told him "I don't give a toss" when he tried to explain that he was helping the woman, who is in her 70s and uses a cane, in Nailsworth, Gloucestershire</h2>

      <p>A taxi driver claims he was given a £70 <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/parking-tickets">parking ticket</a> while he was helping an elderly woman who has difficulty walking on her own.</p>
      <p>Nigel Cooke, 51, said he was helping the customer, aged in her 70s, down a flight of steps to his car when a parking warden handed him a fine.</p>
      <p>The driver claims the warden told him "I don't give a toss" when he tried to explain, and the "embarrassed" customer even offered to pay the fine after the incident in Nailsworth, Gloucestershire.</p>
      <p>Mr Cooke admits his car was partially obstructing a pavement, but says the warden should have been "more compassionate", <a href="https://www.gloucestershirelive.co.uk/news/gloucester-news/taxi-driver-complains-traffic-warden-3509447">GloucestershireLive</a> reports.</p>
      <p>The Freebs Taxis driver, from Stroud, said he parked his car by a stairwell so he could help the woman down to his car from a beauty salon.</p>

      <p>He claims his car was "three quarters" on a private road and a "quarter" on a pavement while he picked up the fare on Wednesday morning.</p>
      <p>But about three minutes later, as he was helping the woman, who uses a cane, a traffic warden approached the car and gave him a ticket, he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Cooke added: "She can’t walk very well and she can grab the handrail to go on the steps.</p>
      <p>"So basically I pulled up to pick her up.</p>
      <p>"I parked there and ran up the stairs and waited three minutes for her to come out.</p>
      <p>"I’ve opened the door and then the traffic warden’s just stood there and, honestly, he couldn’t get the ticket on the screen quick enough.</p>
      <p>"So I’ll hold my hands up say that I am obstructing a little bit but it didn’t stop people walking past from the pavement to the opposite side.</p>
      <p>"I told him that I am picking a lady up and he told me, ‘I don’t give a toss’.</p>
      <p>"I said, 'Please don’t swear', and he goes, ‘It’s not swearing’, and all that. It’s just his attitude, really."</p>
      <p>Mr Cooke said the woman was "embarrassed" and even offered to pay the fine.</p>
      <p>He added: "I totally agree with having traffic wardens.</p>
      <p>"I think in a little town like Nailsworth, it sort of needs it - just really for people who park stupidly, so I'm not totally against them.</p>
      <p>"But I think (the warden) could have been more compassionate really."</p>
      <p>A Gloucestershire County Council spokesperson said: “We’re sorry to hear this taxi driver was unhappy with his experience with a civil enforcement officer.</p>
      <p>"We take these concerns very seriously and will be fully investigating the matter.</p>
      <p>“The PCN can be challenged by following the instructions on the reverse of the ticket and if an appeal is submitted we will consider all points raised and respond appropriately.”</p>
