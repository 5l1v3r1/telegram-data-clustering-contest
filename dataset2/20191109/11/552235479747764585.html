      <p>Leicester boss <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/brendan-rodgers">Brendan Rodgers</a> has edged ahead of former team Celtic in the race to land Scottish star Bruno Davidson.</p>
      <p>The 15-year-old winger plays for Edinburgh boys’ side Hutchison Vale and has attracted interest from clubs north and south of the border.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> have already offered him a three-year deal, but there's also been interest from England with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> , Wolves and Sunderland all keen.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> boss Rodgers has jumped in front of his old club by offering Davidson a trial and he played for the club's Under 16s squad as a trialist against West Ham, who are also keen in him.</p>

      <p>And Davidson has also been invited for a trial later this month by Southampton as the battle to land the highly-rated talent hots up.</p>
      <p>Rodgers spoke on Friday about one day being welcomed back into the Celtic fold after his controversial exit in February.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He told <a href="https://theathletic.co.uk/1351094/2019/11/08/james-rodgers/?redirected=1">The Athletic</a> : “People talk about a legacy, and it’s always visual what they talk about. For me, it’s about what people feel. So with Celtic, for example, we won seven trophies and we created history there."</p>
      <p>"And once they take away how I left, hopefully there’s a feeling of, ‘That was a very good team. I loved going to watch them play and how they played.’</p>
