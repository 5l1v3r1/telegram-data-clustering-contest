      <h1>Ben Mendelsohn Dunking on Every Marvel Hero That's Not Spider-Man Is Exactly What We Needed Today</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T11:00:10+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author">James Whitbrook</a></address>
      <p>Remember <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/08/report-spider-man-will-no-longer-be-shared-by-marvel-and-sony/">that wild month</a> where we all thought Spider-Man might not be in the MCU and everyone promptly <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/08/no-one-is-as-confused-about-the-spider-man-mess-as-jeff-goldblum/">got a bit wound up about it</a>? Well, even if that ended up <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/09/sony-and-marvel-strike-a-new-deal-to-keep-spider-man-in-the-mcu/">not being the case</a>, it turns out no one might have kicked off more than Ben Mendelsohn.</p>
      <p>Mendelsohn is, of course, part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe himself now, having appeared as Talos the Skrull alongside both <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/captain-marvels-cat-actors-had-trouble-performing-with-1833267933?_ga=2.45713570.78407123.1572806476-105069102.1526253072">Brie Larson’s Captain Marvel</a> and Tom Holland’s Spider-Man (<i>technically</i> for the latter, given that he’s disguised as Samuel L. Jackson <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/07/the-comic-book-legacies-behind-far-from-homes-final-post-credit-scene/">for most of it</a>) in <i>Captain Marvel</i> and <i>Spider-Man: Far From Home</i>. But, speaking to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/06/spider-mans-ben-mendelsohn-insists-peter-parker-marvels-important-hero-sony-row-11053015/">Metro</a> recently, the actor enunciated in a spectacularly sweary fashion that he would happily trash not just his own role but basically a good chunk of the Marvel roster before contemplating the reality where Marvel Studios really did lose out on future appearances from the web-slinger.</p>
      <p>“I think what happens in these things is, most of the time, cooler heads prevail,” Mendelsohn told Metro, before promptly doing the exact opposite himself. “Sometimes we end up in a situation which feels like it’s going to be the lead up to World War I.”</p>
      <p>“But shit, man. You can’t lose Spider-Man from the Marvel universe. He’s one of their absolute motherfucking pornstars,” Mendelsohn continued. “Boy, I could name 30 that you could quite comfortably lose before you start thinking about losing Spider-Man. In fact, I cannot think of a single character who’s more important to Marvel than Spider-Man. You’ve got Hulk, you’ve got Thor… none of them are as important as Spider-Man. None of them.”</p>
      <p>You heard the man, Mark Ruffalo and Chris Hemsworth. You? And <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/epic-cast-class-photo-shows-just-how-huge-marvels-cinem-1822838611">28 other Marvel stars</a>? <i>Nothing</i>. Ben Mendelsohn would come for all of you like he was Thanos himself, because you are nothing compared to Spider-Man. You are the very dirt beneath his likely well-fashioned feet.</p>
      <p>I want to hear his full list, frankly. Actually – I don’t care that the Marvel movies are, by and large, PG-13 affairs. I want the next <i>Spider-Man</i> movie to have a scene where someone question’s Peter’s capacity only for Talos to stroll into Avengers HQ and deliver this quote, curse-laden word for word, as Mendelsohn chews on the scenery around him like he’d not eaten in <i>days</i>.</p>
      <p>And you know what? <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-amazing-spectacular-sensational-and-ultimate-yea-1831155043">He’d be right</a>.</p>
