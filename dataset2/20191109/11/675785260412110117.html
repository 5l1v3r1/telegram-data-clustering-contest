      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/whitney-houston">Whitney Houston</a> 's secret lesbian lover Robyn Crawford has described the moment she watched in horror as the superstar singer married Bobby Brown.</p>
      <p>Whitney and Robyn were long rumoured to have been more than just friends, and the star's former assistant spoke out this week to confirm one of the worst kept secrets in Hollywood.</p>
      <p>The fitness trainer, 58, has now described how she felt Whitney "slipping away" after their split as the superstar started to date men including Jermaine Jackson, Eddie Murphy and Bobby Brown.</p>
      <p>Robyn longed for Whitney to continue a romantic relationship with her and she recalled her heartache as she watched the singer tied the knot with Bobby in 1992.</p>
      <p>To make matters worse, Robyn had been chosen as maid of honour and she struggled to maintain her composure during the ceremony.</p>
      <p>In a new memoir called A Song For You: My Life With Whitney Houston, Robyn wrote: "I felt her slipping away after the split].</p>
      <p>"I could live without being romantically involved, but I had trouble facing the walls that were going up..."</p>

      <p>Of the wedding, she added: "I was her maid of honour and I was very emotional.</p>
      <p>"I looked into her eyes when when I took her the bouquet, taking one last look."</p>
      <p>Whitney's former assistant claimed she had a physical relationship with the superstar until Whitney broke it off amid fears it could damage her career.</p>
      <p>The I Have Nothing singer went on to start dating rapper Bobby in 1989, although Robyn claims Whitney was actually more interested in Eddie.</p>
      <p>She even claims the Hollywood star tried to stop Whitney tying the knot with the musician.</p>

      <p>Whitney and Bobby went through with their marriage but it was plagued by rumours of infidelity, heavy drug use and allegations of physical abuse before they divorced in 2007.</p>
      <p>The superstar was long rumoured to have a steamy history with her childhood best friend and later personal assistant Robyn.</p>
      <p>Whitney died age 48 on February 11, 2012 after drowning in a bath at the Beverly Hilton hotel after ingesting a cocktail of cocaine, cannabis and prescription drugs.</p>
      <p>In 2015, Whitney and Bobby's daughter Bobbi was found unconscious in a bathtub - she died six months later, aged 22.</p>
