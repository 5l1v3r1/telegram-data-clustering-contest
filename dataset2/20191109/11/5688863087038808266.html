      <h3>Preview</h3>
      <p>It will be a battle between two settled teams under experienced Spanish managers who are desperate to go into the international break at the back of a comfortable win. But, the East India derby won’t be an easy one given the names on paper both teams possess and the offensive mindset they play with. </p>
      <p>Hosts ATK are confident with two back to back wins, including an away win against the other two-time champions <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/chennaiyin_fc">Chennaiyin FC</a>, and are fourth on the table with six points. Jamshedpur, on the other hand, would be on the road for the first time this season and are unbeaten.They are third on the table with seven points.</p>
      <p>What makes this match more exciting would be the ample days of rest they have got and the minimal injuries they are dealing with.</p>
      <h3>Key Players</h3>
      <p>ATK's former A-League duo of Roy Krishna and Australian David Williams are the key players under Habas. Williams has three goals to his name already and is a joint top scorer this season. Indian defender Prabhir Das has also been a key player in the defence as well as offence for ATK.</p>
      <p>For Iriondo, his Spanish armada of Sergio Castel, Piti and Tiri are the core favourites to get the job done. The Men of Steel will also be happy with their in-form forward Indian likes of Farukh Choudhary and goalkeeper <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/player/subrata_paul">Subrata Paul</a>.</p>
      <h3>Team News</h3>
      <p>Antonio Habas has a fit squad under his disposal. He may give chance to midfielder Edu Garcia in the starting eleven, who has been in excellent form of late. He may continue with the rest of the team used against Chennaiyin although the return of Jobby Justin from suspension does add options for him.</p>
      <p>Antonio Iriondo also has a similar fit squad with former Kerala Blasters forward C.K Vineeth returning from injury and might get a chance.</p>
      <h3>Head to Head</h3>
      <p>Both teams have faced each other four times after Jamshedpur’s entry into ISL in the 2017-18 season. Both teams have one win each while the remaining two went onto draws.</p>

      <h3>Manager History</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Antonio Habas</b>
      </p>
      <p>The first-ever ISL winning coach is a veteran and has vast coaching experience with Spanish sides in <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/tournament/la_liga">La Liga</a> and the lower divisions. He also coached Bolivian National Team and also had a stint with defunct Pune City FC. The 62-year-old is one of the most animated coaches in ISL and has also faced disciplinary actions.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Antonio Iriondo</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Spanish manager has a vast experience in Spain and has managed several clubs. To make things easier, he has a mini Spanish squad under his command at Jamshedpur. He plays Highline tactics, which was seen against Odisha FC even playing with 10 men. The 65-year-old coach’s first outing outside Spain for the first time might be fruitful considering the strong squad he has.</p>
