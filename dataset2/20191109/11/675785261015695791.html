      <h1>EXCLUSIVE: Blades runner Brown recalls when Sheffield United were last sixth in the top flight</h1>
      <h2>Jim Brown was United's goalkeeper the last time the Blades were sixth back in May 1975</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T11:31:53+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 11:31</time> by <a rel="author">David Anderson, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-anderson/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/sheffield-united-fc">Sheffield United</a> sitting sixth may be a novelty for any Blades fan under 50, but Jim Brown has seen it all before.</p>
      <p>Brown was United’s goalkeeper when they were last this high in the top flight in May 1975.</p>
      <p>Ken Furphy’s side, which boasted Tony Currie, the man acclaimed as their best-ever player, finished four points behind champions Derby and just one outside Europe.</p>
      <p>Brown, who signed for £65-a-week when he joined from Chesterfield the previous year, claims they had many of the same qualities as Chris Wilder’s team.</p>
      <p>“Realistically, like Sheffield United fans now, we thought if we stay up, we’ll have done well,” said the former Scotland international.</p>

      <p>“Early on we had a few good results, which bred confidence, and that’s the same for the players this season.</p>
      <p>“We had goalscorers, Alan Woodward scored 12 and Tony Field got 11, and other good players like Eddie Colquhoun, Len Badger and Ted Hemsley.</p>
      <p>“From January 4, we played 18 games and only lost two of them. </p>
      <p>“We drew our last game at Birmingham 0-0 and we finished just a point outside a UEFA Cup place.</p>
      <p>“We felt disappointed to get so close, even though we didn’t set out to make Europe. To fall at the last was hard to take.”</p>
      <p>Brown, 67, kept 11 clean sheets and was named United’s Player of the Year that season, but says the undoubted star was the mercurial Currie.</p>
      <p>“He was unbelievable, a great player,” he said. “I played in America in the same team as Johan Cruyff and played against Carlos Alberto and not many of them matched TC.</p>
      <p>“I remember playing against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> when he nutmegged Alan Ball, when he sat on the ball and blew kisses to the crowd. He was so confident and he gave us confidence. I also played in the game when him and Alan Birchenhall clashed and then kissed each other.</p>
      <p>“Football then was more romantic. We all wanted to win, but you could have a laugh.”</p>
      <p>That season is a cautionary tale for the Blades and Furphy was sacked five months later in October 1975 because of their poor start.</p>
      <p>Within 12 months, Currie was sold to Leeds and the Blades were relegated, beginning a downwards spiral to the Fourth Division by 1981.</p>

      <p>Brown, who has been Chesterfield’s commercial manager since 1985, is confident only good times lie ahead for United under the streetwise Wilder.</p>
      <p>“I’m chuffed for them,” he said. “They’re not a team of internationals, like we weren’t, but the players are playing for Chris Wilder, like we played for Ken Furphy.</p>
      <p>“They have a good defence, a good keeper and are well organised. I hope they can sustain it.”</p>
      <p>Brown combined his role as Chesterfield’s commercial manager with emergency reserve goalkeeper for 12 years and was on the bench, aged 43, for their 1995 Division Three play-off win over Bury.</p>
      <p>“The team went away to Wembley on the Friday to stay in a hotel,” said Brown, who made his last appearance on the bench at 45. “I had to stay until the Saturday morning because I had 30 buses to see off. </p>
      <p>“I jumped on the last bus, got to Wembley, got changed, sat on the bench and then went up and got my winner’s medal.”</p>
