      <h3>SIXTEEN wanted felons were hauled to jail by agents of the Police Regional Office 12 in a string of anti-criminality operations in the region, PRO12 director Brig. Gen. Alfred Corpus said yesterday.</h3>
      <p>The official said that one of the suspects was an 18-year-old boy who was arrested for stealing a motorcycle in Sto. Niño, South Cotabato.</p>
      <p>Corpus said a concerned citizen who saw the suspect pushing a Honda XRM motorcycle in front of a gasoline station in Purok San Vicente in Poblacion Sto. Niño around 10:55 a.m. on All Souls’ Day called the police.</p>
      <p>Acting on the information, a team of policemen led by Chief Master Sergeant Allan Ortegas and Senior MSgt. Cezar Gonzales rushed to the site and arrested the young suspect.</p>
      <p>Corpus said the suspect stole the motorbike left unattended by its registered owner, Jess Quimsing.</p>
      <p>Quimsing reported the theft of his motorbike to the local police.</p>
      <p>The other 15 suspects, including two most wanted men in South Cotabato, were arrested during the long weekend.</p>
      <p>Members of the South Cotabato Police Provincial Office headed by Col. Joel Limson arrested six of the suspects, including the no. 3 most wanted man in Lake Sebu, and the no. 8 most wanted in Polomolok town.</p>
      <p>The Sultan Kudarat PPO under Col. Reynaldo Celestino jailed five of the suspects, including one wanted for arson, and one for theft.</p>
      <p>Two others, who are wanted for murder and frustrated murder and illegal possession of firearms and ammunition, were arrested by operatives of the Cotabato City Police Office headed by Col. Portia Manalad.</p>
      <p>Corpus said that the arrests were made in line with his order for his men to further step-up their campaign against most wanted persons in the region.</p>
      <p>“This is part of our effort to make Socsksargen region a much safer place to live and do business,” said the official.</p>
