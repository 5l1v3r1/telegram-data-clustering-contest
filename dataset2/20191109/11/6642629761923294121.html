      <p>Businessman Wibharry Padmoasmolo was arrested for allegedly masterminding the plot by paying almost $3,000 to four men to commit the killings.</p>
      <p>Padmoasmolo allegedly owns a firm that produces palm oil - a widely used vegetable oil found in everything from soap to chocolate - which was in a dispute with locals that the two victims were advocating for, police said.</p>
      <p>The killings were aimed at stopping the pair's involvement, according to authorities, who added that Padmoasmolo has denied owning the firm under questioning.</p>
      <p>"The suspects asked the victims why they had come to the plantation before a quarrel broke out, which ended in murder," said the North Sumatra police chief, Agus Andrianto, according to the local paper Jakarta Post.</p>
      <p>In all, five people have been arrested in connection with the murder plot and police said they are still searching for several more suspects still at large.</p>
      <p>Victims Sianipar and Siregar worked together for a local online news portal before going freelance in 2017.</p>
      <p>A friend of Siregar said they had recently become known for their activism in land disputes - a common source of conflict across the resource-rich Southeast Asian archipelago.</p>
      <p>The friend said Siregar was active in an organisation that advocated for residents in the dispute.</p>
      <p>Many cases of violence against journalists in Indonesia go unsolved, according to the Alliance of Independent Journalists, which has reported at least two dozen cases this year alone.</p>
      <p>Indonesia is ranked 124th out of 180 countries on the 2019 World Press Freedom Index published by Reporters Without Borders.</p>
