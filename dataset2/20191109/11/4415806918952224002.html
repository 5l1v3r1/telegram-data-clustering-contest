      <p>All trams are stopped on a large part of the Luas Red Line this morning because of a "technical problem".</p>
      <p>There are no services running from either Tallaght or Saggart as far as Blackhorse.</p>
      <p>Luas operator Transdev says "alternative buses" are serving the stops, and Dublin Bus is accepting tram tickets.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Red Line passengers were advised that "there is currently no Luas operating between Tallaght / Saggart - Blackhorse due to a technical fault.</p>
      <p>"Services are operating between Blackhorse - Connolly / The Point only.</p>
      <p>"An alternative bus service is servicing all affected stops and Luas tickets are valid on Dublin Bus.</p>
      <p>"We apologise for any inconvenience caused."</p>
      <p>The statement added that Green Line services are operating normally.</p>
