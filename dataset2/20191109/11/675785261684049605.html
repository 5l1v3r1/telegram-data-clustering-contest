      <h1>Champions League 'set to return to ITV' as BT Sport face stiff competition to keep rights</h1>
      <h2>ITV has returned to the table with bids for several packages ahead of Monday's deadline while streaming services could also rival the established broadcasters</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T11:37:54+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 11:37</time> by <a rel="author">James Whaling, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/james-whaling/</a></address>
      <p>Champions League football could be set for a return to terrestrial television from 2021 after ITV reportedly made a huge play to wrestle some of the coverage away from BT Sport.</p>
      <p>ITV have submitted bids for 'several' of the packages on offer ahead of Monday's deadline as UEFA look to attract numerous broadcast partners.</p>
      <p>The rights have been split into more packages for the three-year period between 2021 and 2024 - including selling the final as a stand-alone match for the first time, report the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7666199/Champions-League-poised-RETURN-ITV-2021.html">Daily Mail.</a></p>
      <p>BT have enjoyed exclusive UK broadcasting rights to the competition since 2015 having paid Â£1.18million for the three-year cycle which ends at the culmination of next season.</p>

      <p>Sky Sports have also reportedly bid while streaming services such as DAZN will challenge the traditional broadcasters.</p>
      <p>It is understood ITV are not in the market for exclusive rights and Amazon Prime - who will broadcast Premier League fixtures on Boxing Day - have not bid.</p>
      <p>The Premier League boasts the current holders of the Champions League after <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> beat <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> in an all-English final last season.</p>
      <p>Those two sides along with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> are in the this year's competition and all four clubs are handily placed to reach the knockout stages.</p>
