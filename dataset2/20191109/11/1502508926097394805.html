      <p>Union Minister <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/who-is-piyush-goyal">Piyush Goyal </a>on Saturday said the unanimous judgement of the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/supreme-court">Supreme Court </a>on <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ayodhya">Ayodhya </a>dispute has ended a decades-old legal dispute.</p>
      <p>The minister appealed people to accept the order and maintain the environment of peace and tranquility.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/supreme-court">Supreme Court </a>on Saturday paved the way for the construction of a Ram Temple by a Trust at the disputed site at Ayodhya, and directed the Centre to allot an alternative 5-acre plot to the Sunni Waqf Board for building a new mosque at a "prominent" place in the holy town in Uttar Pradesh.</p>
      <p>"This is a welcome decision of the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/supreme-court">Supreme Court </a>which has been taken unanimously by the court. This decision has lead to the end of decades old legal issue," he said in a tweet.</p>
      <p>He said this historic verdict of the Supreme Court will further strengthen the culture, tradition and unity of the country.</p>
      <p>The minister said he would like to thank the judiciary, all organisation, society and people who were involved in resolving the matter.</p>
