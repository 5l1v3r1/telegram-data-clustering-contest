      <h3>(Parang wala na tayong kalaban)</h3>
      <p>INSIDE a function room of a five-star hotel in Manila, Philippine Olympic Committee boss Abraham Tolentino got busy getting updates and encouraging words from more than 50 heads and representatives of National Sports Associations who met with him the other day to assess the country's chances in the Southeast Asian Games that's just a little more than two weeks away.</p>
      <p>After a meeting that lasted for almost three hours, the Cavite representtive who also happens to be the president of the local cycling body was seen flashing a wide grin as he bid the NSAs head goodbye.</p>
      <p>The reason? Well, the POC chief, Bambol to relatives, friends and sportsmen, heard what he wanted to hear from the NSAs--winning the overall championship in the 30th edition of the biennial meet which is kicking off in colorful rites on Nov. 30 at the Philippine Arena in Bocaue, Bulacan.</p>
      <p>"Based on their projections, we can win 130 to 180 gold medals. And that's doable," Tolentino told sportswriters after the meeting.</p>
      <p>That total is slightly lower than the 220-gold medal total predicted by several NSAs during a coordination meeting with Philippine Sports Commission and chef de mission Butch Ramirez recently.</p>
      <p>According to the 45 of the 56 NSAs competing in the 11-nation, 12-day meet, Team Philippines is capable of winning 220 golds that's  more than enough to capture the overall championship which local sports officials want like crazy considering the big fortune the government has spent in the athletes' training and participation overseas ahead of the SEA Games.</p>
      <p>A total of 1,115 athletes will make up a Philippine contingent seeking to emerge No. 1 for the second time after topping it in 2005, the biggest ever assembled since the country started seeing action in the meet in 1977.</p>
      <p>Foremost among these Filipino athletes seeing action before their countrymen are newly-crowned world gymnastics champion Carlos Yulo, female world boxing titlist Nesthy Petecio, Rio Olympics weighlifting silver medalist Hidilyn Diaz, world boxing silver medal winner Eumir Marcial, Asian pole vault titlist  EJ Obiena and skateboarding wunderkind and Asian Games gold medalist Margielyn Didal.</p>
      <p>These athletes are expected to dominate their respective events come the SEA Games as they spearhead a contingent that got all it wanted as far as financial help from the government sports agency is concerned.</p>
      <p>Where will these gold medals come from, Tolentino was asked?</p>
      <p>Tolentino said that bulk of our gold medals will come from contact sports, with arnis projecting a whopping 15-gold harvest out of 20 events while boxing, judo, kickboxing, jiu-jitsu, sambo and wrestling are also expected to become rich sources of victories.</p>
      <p>In the same meeting with Tolentino, the dancesport body projected at least 10 gold medals, athletics and gymnastics said they can take a minimum of nine golds each and skateboarding is seeking an eight-gold sweep with Didal leading the local challenge in this event which is taking a bow in the Tokyo Olympics next year.</p>
      <p>The Filipinos are also heavily-anticipated to score heavily in the ballgames, specially in basketball with the Samahang Basketbol ng Pilpinas eyeing a sweep of the four events, including  the men's division where a collection of professionals led by June Mar Fajardo and Japeth Aguilar will carry the national colors.</p>
      <p>There's softball, too. Being a top gun in the Asian softball scene, the Philippines is also seen a cinch for the gold medal in both divisions despite the inroads made by Indonesia and Thailand in the sport.</p>
      <p>The call for Team Philippines to go for the overall title will be made again on Wednesday at the Rizal Coliseum, this time by no less than President Duterte during a fitting get-together at the newly-refurbished Rizal Memorial Coliseum</p>
      <p>An array of great stars like Paeng Nepomuceno of bowling, Lydia de Vega and Elma Muros of track and field, Onyok Velasco of boxing and Ramon Fernandez of basketball will also grace the afternoon occassion and share with the athletes their stories of triumphs.</p>
