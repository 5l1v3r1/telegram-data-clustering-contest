      <h1>Amazon Removes ‘Daddy’s Little Slut’ Kids Merch After Backlash</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T11:27:15+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 11:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/author/jbanim/" target="_blank">Julia Banim</a></address>

        <b>Amazon has removed a kid’s T-shirt bearing the slogan ‘Daddy’s little slut’ from sales following a fierce public backlash.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The shocking tee had been sold via a third party seller called Onlybabycare, priced at $18 (£14). According to the product description, this is a unisex clothing item and can be worn by ‘little girls or boys’. It could also be purchased in baby and toddler sizes.</p>
      <p>The description on <a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/technology/samuel-l-jackson-will-be-a-voice-option-for-amazon-alexa-users/">Amazon</a> also offered examples of where the grossly offensive T-shirt could be worn, listing occasions such as ‘playing outside, birthday party, baby shower, baptism, wedding, baby photography, daily wear, family day’.</p>

      <p>The grim item had been on sale since June 2019, with shipping only available in the US, though the T-shirt itself has now been removed from the sales site, as the <i><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/amazon-tshirt-daddys-little-slut-tshirt-only-babycare-a9194486.html">Independent</a></i> reports.</p>
      <p>Shoppers were understandably baffled and horrified by this apparent sexualising of children, taking to social media to demand Amazon remove the product with immediate effect.</p>
      <p>
        <b>One person tweeted the following warning to Amazon:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>I get this is an auto generated line from a third party seller but don’t ever let me catch this kind of crap being sold through your website ever again. You better start checking stuff. I will cancel my card.</blockquote>
      <p>Another remarked that, although the top in question had been removed, there were still other disturbing clothing items being sold via Amazon from Onlybabycare. Other slogans included ‘Boats and Hoes’ and ‘Black guns matter’.</p>

        <b>An Amazon spokesperson has since given the following comment:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>All sellers must follow our selling guidelines and those who do not will be subject to action including potential removal of their account,<br/><br/>The product in question is no longer available.</blockquote>
      <p>According to <a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/external/help.html?itemID=200390640&amp;language=en_GB&amp;ref=efph_200390640_cont_1801">Amazon’s Seller Code of Conduct</a>, ‘pornographic, obscene or offensive content’ is prohibited in ‘detail page titles, descriptions, bullet points or images’.</p>

      <p>This isn’t the only incident in recent times where a retailer has faced criticism for selling inappropriate clothing through their site.</p>
      <p>Museum officials at Auschwitz were left appalled earlier this year after learning Redbubble were selling mini skirts and pillow cases featuring photographs of the Nazi concentration camp.</p>
      <p>One photo showed the chimneys at Auschwitz, while another showed the train tracks that led so many to their deaths. The items have since been removed from the site.</p>
