      <h3>UNIVERSITY of the Philippines hopes to make the most out of its hard-earned semifinal  incentive as it tangles with University of Santo Tomas today in the UAAP men's basketball step-ladder phase before an expected huge crowd at the Smart Araneta Coliseum.</h3>
      <p>"The team doesn't dwell on the fact that we have a twice-to-beat advantage. It's a knockout game as far as we're concerned," said Fighting Maroons coach Bo Perasol on the eve of the 4 p.m. match.</p>
      <p>A misstep is what UP, which has a penchant of winning close games all-season long, cannot afford at this point of the tournament.</p>
      <p>A victory by the fourth-ranked Growling Tigers will drag the No. 2 Maroons to a decider on Wednesday at the Mall of Asia Arena.</p>
      <p>Defending two-time champion Ateneo awaits the survivor of the UP-UST showdown in the best-of-three Finals series starting Nov. 16.  The Blue Eagles are in a midst of a long 16-day break after jumping straight to the championship round via 14-0 elimination round sweep.</p>
      <p>The Maroons should be wary of the Tigers, especially with the composure they displayed when the going gets tough.</p>
      <p>UST weathered a late Far Eastern University fightback to fashion out a 81-71 win in the first step-ladder match last Wednesday.</p>
      <p>"For me, I’ve always been optimistic dun sa approach ko sa mga players. You really have to be objective at walang sisihan. Lots of players are committing mistakes. Even us siguro kaming mga coaches may mga mali rin kami but we stayed positive and we kept on playing," said Tigers coach Aldin  Ayo after ousting the Tamaraws in the title race.</p>
      <p>Soon-to-be-crowned MVP Soulamane Chabi Yo will be the Tigers' main man, as the Benin native will go up against Nigerian Bright Akhuetie, who won the highest individual honor last season.</p>
      <p>Both teams have a bevy of athletic players that will give more excitement to the game, as UST's Rhenz Abando, Mark Nonoy, Renzo Subido and Brent Paraiso will face a equally talented UP crew led by Kobe Paras, Jun Manzo, brothers Juan and Javi Gomez de Liaño.</p>
      <p>The last time both schools cross paths at this point of the season was in 1996, when the Tigers eliminated the Maroons en route to completing a four-peat.</p>
      <p>In the women's step-ladder, FEU and Adamson clash in a no-tomorrow match at 12 noon, with the winner facing twice-to-beat UST in the next phase.  Six-peat seeking National University is in a Finals after achieving another perfect 14-0 campaign in the eliminations.</p>
