      <p>Detective Michael Fields used commercial DNA site GEDmatch for assistance on a homicide investigation in 2018, but at that time there were no restrictions placed on law enforcement personnel seeking information.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.wftv.com/news/local/orlando-homicide-detective-uses-commercial-dna-website-to-solve-murders/1006625875">The site changed its policy in May of this year</a>, however, and decided it would not easily release information to law enforcement agencies, the type of information that previously had helped Fields crack a decade-old homicide case.</p>
      <p>“It was sitting in the file, and we didn’t have a match,” said Fields.</p>
      <p>The case went cold. The DNA sample from the 2001 slaying of University of Central Florida student Christine Frank led police nowhere.</p>
      <p>More than 15 years later, <a href="https://www.wftv.com/news/local/orlando-homicide-detective-uses-commercial-dna-website-to-solve-murders/1006625875">Fields said he turned to commercial DNA sites for help</a>.</p>
      <p>Fields first tried with Ancestry.com and 23 and Me, then he finally looked into GEDmatch, which gave him what he needed.</p>
      <p>“When I got the results back, I was floored,” Fields said.</p>
      <p>When detectives ran the DNA sample from the crime scene, the database linked it to three people believed to be distant cousins of the killer.</p>
      <p>Detectives were able to track down their suspect and make an arrest.</p>
      <p>But now, when he wanted to use the same site in a different case, Fields learned GEDmatch had changed its privacy policy, but he got around it.</p>
      <p>“I just applied the same thing we’ve been doing for years to this new thing,” Fields said.</p>
      <p>He wrote up a search warrant of more than 50 pages.</p>
      <p>“Since it was the first search warrant ever written against a genealogy website, I made sure every 'i' was dotted, every 't' was crossed,” Fields said.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.wftv.com/news/local/orlando-homicide-detective-uses-commercial-dna-website-to-solve-murders/1006625875">A judge signed it, and GEDmatch responded within 24 hours</a>, letting Fields push aside those privacy settings and search the website's database of about 1.5 million people. </p>
      <p>He wasn’t able to provide a lot of detail about the case, but Fields did say the DNA data did generate some leads.</p>
