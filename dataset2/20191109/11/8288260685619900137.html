      <p>Yellow weather warnings are in place for two areas of the UK.</p>
      <p>Following recent flooding in parts of the country, the Met Office has warned of heavy rain coming on Saturday, November 9.</p>
      <p>One warning is place from 11am to midnight stretching from Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire, to Eastbourne and Portsmouth. The affected area appears to come as far north as Wellesbourne in south Warwickshire.</p>
      <p>Another warning is for 5am to 8pm covering Northern Ireland from Ballycastle to Newry. Northern Ireland could see up to 50mm of rain on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>In addition, the Government's Environment Agency issued a number of flood warnings and flood alerts.</p>
      <p>These include a flood alert for the River Leam and River Itchen in Warwickshire.</p>
      <p>The agency said river levels were high and there was a risk of flooding, following persistent heavy rainfall.</p>

      <p>It says flooding is affecting low-lying land and roads adjacent to the River Leam between Grandborough and Leamington including Kites Hardwick, Birdingbury, Marton, Eathorpe, Hunningham and Offchurch.</p>
      <p>Flooding is also affecting land and roads next to the River Itchen between Southam and Marton including Long Itchington.</p>
      <p>Further rainfall is forecast over the next 24 hours. River levels are expected to remain high throughout Saturday and Sunday and agency workers are monitoring the situation, it said.</p>

      <p>Yorkshire and the Midlands were among the areas worst affected by heavy downpours on Thursday and Friday.</p>
      <p>Sheffield in South Yorkshire received 84mm of rain over 36 hours, which is almost the average monthly rainfall for Yorkshire, Mr Petanga said.</p>
      <p>Gringley on the Hill in Nottinghamshire had 65mm of rain in that time.</p>
      <p>The Environment Agency issued seven severe flood warnings on Saturday morning suggesting there is a "danger to life".</p>
      <p>The warnings are in place for the River Don at Barnby Dun, Bently, Fishlake, Kirk Bramwith, Kirk Sandall, South Bramwith and Willow Bridge caravan site.</p>
      <p>There are also 54 warnings telling people to take immediate action in light of expected flooding, along with 80 alerts urging residents to be prepared.</p>
      <p>Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn is due to visit flood-hit areas of South Yorkshire on Saturday after Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited Matlock in Derbyshire on Friday.</p>
      <p>During the visit, Mr Johnson said the widespread flooding across the UK "is not looking like something we need to escalate to the level of a national emergency".</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson said the Government will "certainly stand by ready to help" after the country was hit by deluge of water described as "almost biblical" by residents in Toll Bar, near Doncaster.</p>
      <p>His visit came after the death of a woman who was reportedly swept away by floodwater in Rowsley.</p>
      <p>The body of the woman, who has not been identified, was recovered in Darley Dale, near Matlock, at about 10.40am on Friday, Derbyshire Police said.</p>
      <p>The heavy rain forced the closure of train lines in north England on Friday with several lines still affected on Saturday.</p>
