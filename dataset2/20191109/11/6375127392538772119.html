      <h3>THE Manila North Cemetery (MNC) has become a haven for ‘flying voters.’</h3>
      <p>This is contained in a report recently received by Mayor Isko Moreno, as the clearing operations which began before ‘Undas’ in the said cemetery continues.</p>
      <p>According to the report, thousands of residents who have set up shanties inside the cemeteries are not actually from Manila but were able to register as voters through the help of some unscrupulous city officials and barangay chairmen.</p>
      <p>Moreno said the matter had been investigated and verified to be true, adding that the said flying voters went to the extent of desecrating the dead by building their shanties on top of tombs and using other burial sites as their comfort rooms.</p>
      <p>Citing the verified information forwarded to his office, Moreno said the flying voters were being tapped not only during local elections but even in the barangay elections.</p>
      <p>‘Ikaw chairman, ilang botante kailangan mo?’ was said to be the standard line of a former cemetery official who reportedly asked for money in exchange for ‘lending’ the flying voters who are also paid for the job.</p>
      <p>Moreno said that more than anything else, the primary concern of the city government which became the basis for the clearing operations is to address the complaints of those whose departed loved ones’ tombs and mausoleums at the MNC have been desecrated.</p>
      <p>‘Kaya pala parang mga kabuteng nagsulputan sa sementeryo. Ikaw ba, tapakan ang puntod ng kamag-anak mo, ano pakiramdam mo?’, the mayor said.</p>
      <p>‘Ang sementeryo ay para sa paty, hindi sa buhay,’Moreno added, as he also questioned where and how the said flying voters get their water and power supply, which he said is also tantamount to stealing from taxpayers’ money.</p>
