      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T11:49:38+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 11:49</time> by <a rel="author">Pavan Dahat</a></address>
      <p><b>Nagpur, MAHARASHTRA: <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/shiv-sena/">Shiv Sena</a></b> chief <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/uddhav-thackeray/">Uddhav Thackeray</a> on Saturday expressed happiness over the <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/supreme-court/">Supreme Court</a>’s verdict on the <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/ayodhya-verdict-hindu-trust-gets-possession-of-babri-site-muslims-granted-alternative-site_in_5dc64178e4b0fcfb7f6696a8">Ram Temple issue</a> and congratulated everyone who participated in the movement for the temple, including <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/lk-advani/">L.K.Advani</a>, Ashok Singhal, Pramod Mahajan, Gopinath Munde and Atal Bihari Vajpayee.</p>
      <p>But Thackeray, who is <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/devendra-fadnavis-resigns-as-maharashtra-chief-minister-shiv-sena_in_5dc5475ae4b0fcfb7f648431?utm_hp_ref=in-Maharashtra">engaged in a stalemate</a> with former ally <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/bjp/">BJP</a> in <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/Maharashtra/">Maharashtra</a> over power-sharing in the state, did not mention the party, Prime Minister <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/narendra-modi/">Narendra Modi </a>or the <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/rss/">RSS</a>, which claims to have led the agitation over this issue.</p>
      <p>“November 9 will be written in golden words in history.  A dispute of many years has been resolved. I salute the judiciary. I am happy that the dispute regarding  Lord Ram’s birthplace has ended. I also thank everyone for accepting this verdict. Today, everyone would have recollected the entire period of this struggle and everyone will be remembering Shiv Sena Pramukh (<a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/bal-thackeray/">Bal Thackeray</a>) who raised Hindutva when people were scared to call themselves Hindu,” Thackeray said in a press conference at Shiv Sena Bhavan in Mumbai.</p>

      </blockquote>
      <p>On Saturday, a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court, in a <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/ayodhya-verdict-hindu-trust-gets-possession-of-babri-site-muslims-granted-alternative-site_in_5dc64178e4b0fcfb7f6696a8?utm_hp_ref=in-supreme-court">unanimous judgement</a>, granted the site of the demolished Babri Masjid to the Hindu parties to build a temple, while ordering that the Muslim litigants be given a 5 acre alternative site to construct a mosque.</p>
      <p>The Sena chief said he will soon meet Advani, who spearheaded the Ram Janmabhoomi movement in the late 80s. The BJP leader had organised a rath yatra in 1990 demanding a Ram Temple at Ayodhya, which culminated in kar sevaks demolishing the <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/babri-masjid/">Babri Masjid</a> on 6 December, 1992.</p>
      <p>On Friday, Thackeray had said that the credit for the Ram Temple verdict should be given to the judiciary and not to the BJP, with whom his party is locked in a war of words in Maharashtra. </p>
      <p>“I am personally happy. Last year on November 24, <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/2018/11/24/ram-mandir-heres-why-the-shiv-senas-uddhav-thackeray-is-visiting-ayodhya_a_23598973/?utm_hp_ref=in-uddhav-thackeray">I had gone to Ayodhya</a> and prayed there. I had taken some soil from King Shivaji’s birthplace to Ayodhya. I am happy that within a year (of my visit) this verdict has come. In the next two-three days again I will again go to Shivneri (Shivaji’s birthplace) and I am going to Ayodhya on November 24 again. Beliefs and feelings of lakhs of Hindus have been given justice today. I have asked everyone to celebrate graciously.   A new era has started, let’s welcome it with grace,” he added.</p>
      <p>The Shiv Sena had raised the issue of building the temple ahead of the Lok Sabha election as well, and had <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/shiv-sena-on-ayodhya-verdict-maharashtra_in_5dc68199e4b00927b2338b6c">reacted to the verdict</a> saying “Temple first, Government Later”.</p>
      <p>Thackeray refused to comment on the deadlock in Maharashtra, saying “let’s not talk about politics today. Today’s day is of joy. Let’s celebrate and enjoy today.”</p>
      <p>He also took another dig at the BJP, saying that “parties which actually practice Hindutva should come together, not those who do lip service to it”.</p>
      <p>Thackeray’s estranged cousin <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/raj-thackeray/">Raj Thackeray</a> had also <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/raj-thackeray-karsevaks-ram-rajya-ayodhya-verdict_in_5dc6810de4b02bf5794054fc?utm_hp_ref=in-ayodhya-verdict">welcomed the judgement</a>, saying that the “sacrifice” of kar sevaks had not gone to waste.</p>
      <p>Constitutional law expert <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/ayodhya-explained-supreme-court-faizan-mustafa-says_in_5dc694b5e4b02bf57940668f?utm_hp_ref=in-supreme-court">Faizan Mustafa told <i>HuffPost India</i></a> on Saturday that the court seemed to have prioritised the religious beliefs of one section over the rule of law.</p>
      <p>“The court while pronouncing the judgement did try its best to strike a balance between law and faith. But clearly faith has the last laugh here,” he said.</p>
