      <p>MELBOURNE: Batsman Nic Maddinson has withdrawn from Australia A's match against Pakistan on mental health grounds, Cricket Australia said on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Maddinson, who played three tests for Australia in 2016, has previously struggled with mental health issues and took a break from the game in 2017 after being dropped from the test squad.</p>

      <p>Governing body Cricket Australia (CA) said it supported the 27-year-old's decision, which was relayed to team management on Friday.</p>
      <p>"Nic has made the right decision and we are all behind him," Australia A coach Graeme Hick said in a CA statement.</p>
      <p>"It is braver to speak up than to suffer in silence and I applaud Nic for having the courage to put his health first."</p>
      <p>Opening batsman Cameron Bancroft, who was dropped from the test side during the Ashes in England, replaces Maddinson in the Australia A XI for the three-day, day-night match against Pakistan starting Monday at Perth Stadium.</p>
      <p>Maddinson's withdrawal comes just over a week after Australia all-rounder Glenn Maxwell pulled out midway through the Twenty20 series against Sri Lanka over mental health issues.</p>
      <p>Maxwell remains on an indefinite break from all cricket.</p>
      <p>Maddinson was one of a number of batsmen playing an unofficial audition for spots in the test side ahead of a two-match series against Pakistan.</p>
      <p>The first test starts in Brisbane on Nov. 21.</p>
      <p>Australia's T20 side routed Pakistan by 10 wickets in Perth on Friday to win their three-match series 2-0. The first match was abandoned due to rain.</p>
