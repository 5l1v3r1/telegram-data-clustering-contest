      <h3>SILANG, Cavite – Jet Hernandez squandered a big lead just after nine holes but recovered a bit at the finish to regain the lead despite a 79 as Korean Kim Tae Soo blew a solid eagle-spiked start with a closing 40 for a 72 in the second round of the Riviera MVPSF Amateur Championship at Riviera’s Langer course here yesterday.</h3>
      <p>Kim sizzled with a birdie-eagle feat after six holes, his opening three-under 32 proving enough to overhaul an eight-shot deficit after 18 holes as Hernandez, who set the pace with an opening 73, groped and limped with a frontside 41 in the second round. But the Korean lost his touch at the tougher backside of the par-71, demanding layout, double-bogeying the first two holes and closing out with a birdie-bogey game in the last seven holes to end up with a one-over card.</p>
      <p>Hernandez, meanwhile, dropped two more strokes at the back and wound up with a birdie-less eight-over card, barely staying on top at 152 with Kim just behind at 153, the same output up in by Josh Jorge, who carded a 75, while Sean Ramos turned in a 74 to get into the mix at 154, two off the pace heading to the final 18 holes of the annual event conducted and organized by National Golf Association of the Philippines.</p>
      <p>Dan Cruz hobbled with a 77 but closed to within four at 156 while Rho Hyun Ho, also from Korea, also shot a 74 for joint sixth at 157 with Paolo Barro, who fumbled with a 77, and Korean Jung Jaehyun pooled a 159 after a 79 and Lee Sang Min and Miguel Ilas assembled identical 161s after 78 and 81, respectively.</p>
      <p>Kim Seo Yun, also from Korea, recovered strong with three straight birdies from No. 10 and shot a 72, grabbing a two-stroke lead over Junia Gabasa, with a 76 in the women’s side of the championship sponsored by the MVP Sports Foundation wand backed by PLDT Group, Cignal and Metro Pacific Investments.</p>
      <p>Gabasa also carded a 72 for a 148 while erstwhile joint leader Rianne Malixi wavered with a 75 and slipped to third at 149, guaranteeing a fierce showdown in the final 18 holes among the field’s fancied players.</p>
      <p>Hee Yeong Bang made a 75 and lay too far back at 154 with Laurea Duque at 156 after a 78.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Erik Escalona fired a 68 to gain a six-stroke lead over Takuya Kawamura, who shot a 74, in the Mid-Amateur division with Howie Sison at third with a 77 and Raymond Co and Raymond Escalona turned in 78 and 79, respectively.</p>
