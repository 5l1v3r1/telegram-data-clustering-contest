      <h3>POLICE Regional Office 6 director Brig. Gen. Rene Pamuspusan yesterday warned the public on the proliferation of counterfeit bills being distributed by a syndicate in different parts of Western Visayas.</h3>
      <p>“I am reminding the public to carefully scrutinize all paper bills being handed to them and to immediately report to the nearest police station all persons trying to pass off fake money to them,” said Pamuspusan.</p>
      <p>On November 4, a 20-year old resident of  Uswag, Bgy. San Isidro in Jaro, Iloilo City identified as Edmond de la Torre was placed under citizen’s arrest by storeowner Ronel Arroyo after he bought goods from the victim using two fake P500 bills.</p>
      <p>At around 9 p.m. on Monday, the suspect bought 20 cigarette sticks and a bottle of whisky worth P205 from Arroyo, who was then tending to his store in Uswag Subdivision.</p>
      <p>The suspect paid P500 to the victim, who gave him a P295 change. A few hours later, the man returned to the same store and bought cigarettes, a bottle of whisky and ice worth P161. Again, he paid a P500 bill to the victim and was given a P339 change.</p>
      <p>Pamuspusan said that later in the night, Arroyo discovered that the P500 bills paid to him by the suspect could be fake, prompting him to seek the help of their village chief Felix Doreza.</p>
      <p>When placed under citizen’s arrest, the suspect yielded 54 more pieces of suspected fake P500 bills.</p>
      <p>Dela Torre was brought to the Iloilo City Police Station 3 for filing of criminal charges for possession and distribution of fake treasury notes.</p>
