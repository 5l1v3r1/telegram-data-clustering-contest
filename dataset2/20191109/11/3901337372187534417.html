      <p>Earlier this week, Zidane claimed it was Mbappe's dream to play for Los Blancos one day when he was quizzed about the club making a move for the attacker.</p>
      <p>Leonard was not pleased with Zidane's remark after revealing he was annoyed as Mbappe is still under contract with the Ligue 1 champions.</p>

      <p>"All I said was something that Kylian Mbappe had already said himself - that it was his dream to one day wear Real Madrid's white jersey,' Zidane said, as per Daily Mail.</p>
      <p>"That's all I said, and I'm saying it again today and I would repeat it again everyday.</p>
      <p>"I have nothing more to say about Leonardo, I can say whatever I want."</p>
