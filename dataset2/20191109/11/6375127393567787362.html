      <h3>SENATOR Ralph Recto yesterday said the government should create a “digital map” of government projects that will be implemented next year to include “livestreaming” of “big-ticket” public works ventures.</h3>
      <p>“Projects should be geo-tagged, and there should be an app in which the status of a project is just a click away,” Recto said.</p>
      <p>“What we need is a GPS—government project surveillance—system that will not only yield updated data on construction projects, but also non-infrastructure deliverables like books and hospital equipment,” Recto said.</p>
      <p>“So, sa isang school halimbawa, pwede ipakita kung ilang science laboratory equipment ang ipamimigay; kung DoH-run hospital, magkano ang budget nito sa taong ito; at kung DENR reforestation naman ay kung ilang puno ang itatanim,” he said.</p>
      <p>Recto said if “remote monitoring” is now being used by owners of houses being built, then the same can be done in major government infrastructure projects.</p>
      <p>Recto said in the case of infra projects “that cost much in funds and inconvenience,” job-site cameras should be installed and real-time footage be made available to the public. If not, “a time-lapse video can be uploaded regularly.”</p>
      <p>“In this age of Facebook Live, these should not be hard and expensive to do,” Recto said.</p>
      <p>He said if CCTV footage can lead to the capture of criminals, “so can it capture delays in construction.”</p>
      <p>“Raw live video is the best feedback. Pwede makita if work is on time, on budget and according to specifications,” Recto said.</p>
      <p>The senator said for President Rodrigo Duterte, it can be the best monitoring tool of how trillions of tax and borrowed pesos are being spent.</p>
      <p>“He need not wait for Powerpoint reports during Cabinet meetings if he can go on a virtual inspection of projects anytime by just looking at them at the phone of Sen. Bong Go,” Recto said.</p>
      <p>Recto said “remote monitoring” of government projects is not a new idea but one launched three years ago by then Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno.</p>
      <p>Called “Project DIME” or Digital Imaging for Monitoring and Evaluation, the DBM-DOST collaboration employs various technologies like Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), Open Roads Platform, Geotagging and drones.</p>
