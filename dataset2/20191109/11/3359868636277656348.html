      <p>It’s a big win for Chinese tech giant <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/tencent/">Tencent</a> as Hong Kong’s top-most regulator – Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) – has recently granted them a new license to open a virtual bank.</p>
      <p>On Friday, November 8, speaking at the World Blockchain Summit in Wuzhen, China, Tencent’s chief of blockchain division – Yige Cai – said that his company has received a go-ahead from the SFC to open blockchain-based virtual banking system in the country.</p>
      <p>Although not many details of the bank’s launch are available at the moment, Tencent has already started building its team for this project. Sina Finance, a Chinese financial media site quoted Cai <a href="https://finance.sina.com.cn/blockchain/coin/2019-11-08/doc-iicezzrr8051169.shtml">saying</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“Hong Kong’s new regulations and supervision on digital assets transactions validate the importance of blockchain technology and digital assets, which is good news for the whole industry”.</blockquote>
      <p>Note that Tencent is not the only company to get a virtual bank license from the SFC. The Hong Kong regulator has so far granted a virtual banking license to 12 different entities. Among them also includes Infinium Limited which is a joint venture between Industrial and Commerce Bank of China (ICBC), Tencent, and two other institutional investors from Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>Cai praised Tencent’s ability to execute such large projects by pointing out the company’s existing blockchain projects. Tencent is currently working with a fast-food chain <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/mcdonalds-mcd-artificial-intelligence/">McDonald’s</a> for handling its supply chain financing on a blockchain network.</p>
      <h3>Tencent’s Blockchain and Crypto Ambitions</h3>
      <p>Like other tech companies in the market, Tencent is seeing a huge opportunity in the blockchain and the crypto space. The company’s WeChat Pay service is already popular in China giving Tencent an edge in the financial payments industry.</p>
      <p>Recently, Tencent published a <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/tencent-wechat-alipay-libra/">whitepaper</a> citing global competition in the digital marketing space with companies like <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/facebook/">Facebook</a> working on its cryptocurrency project <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-libra-facebooks-cryptocurrency-guide/">Libra</a>. Tencent <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/tencent-wechat-alipay-libra/">sees</a> a major threat to its payments business if Facebook succeeds in launching the Libra cryptocurrency next year.</p>
      <p>Tencent says that Facebook’s Libra can easily make inroads in countries where local currency is weak, and going further, it can dominate the global payments market.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, Hong Kong is also taking some bold measures to regulate its cryptocurrency industry. Earlier this week, the SFC also <a href="https://www.sfc.hk/web/EN/files/ER/PDF/20191106%20Position%20Paper%20and%20Appendix%201%20to%20Position%20Paper%20(Eng).pdf">rolled-out</a> a licensing scheme for local cryptocurrency exchanges which is currently applicable to security brokers operating in Hong Kong.</p>
