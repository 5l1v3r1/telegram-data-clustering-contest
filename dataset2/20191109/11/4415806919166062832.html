      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T11:26:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 11:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/juno-mcenroe/" target="_blank">By Juno McEnroe</a></address>
      <p>Labour party chairman Jack O'Connor has called for parties on the left to join forces as a general election looms in the New Year.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the party's national conference in Mullingar, Westmeath, Mr O'Connor appealed to Labour members to work with the Social Democrats and the Greens in a bid to alter the political landscape.</p>
      <p>He made the call as TDs, senators and delegates gathered in the Midlands where party later Brendan Howlin today will officially launch its by-election campaign.</p>
      <p>But speaking at the opening of the conference, Jack O'Connor accused Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael of being “wedded to the market”.</p>
      <p>The former SIPTU boss argued that there was a need for parties and society to shift or change in order to “tackle inequality”.</p>
      <p>He said that the left needed to be “cohesive” as he called for parties on the left, including Labour, the Social Democrats and the Greens, to work together.</p>
      <p>Labour leader Brendan Howlin later today will launch the party's bid to elect new TDs in the four by-elections taking place on November 29.</p>
      <p>It is expected that Labour's strongest hopes lie in candidates Cllr George Lawlor in Wexford and Cllr Duncan Smith in Dublin Fingal.</p>
      <p>Labour senator Ivana Bacik this morning also told the conference that the party wanted to “end the scourge of homelessness”.</p>
      <p>She said Labour had a strong track record in delivering equality for women, workers rights and children's rights.</p>
