      <p>Josep María Bartomeu, the president of Barcelona, has once again offered a public show of support for the club's coach, Ernesto Valverde.</p>
      <p>Valverde revealed on Friday that the two had eaten together earlier this week and that he still had the club's backing despite recent results and performances not hitting the standards expected.</p>
      <p>In an interview with the agency The Associated Press, Bartomeu has also spoken about the Barça coach, offering him words of encouragement.</p>
      <p>“This season we have brought in young players who have to help us get through those stages,&amp;rdquor; the Barça chief said.</p>
      <p>“We think that Valverde is the ideal coach to lead this blending of a generation of players of a certain age who have been so successful with that of up-and-coming players.</p>
      <p>“It is important to create this bond, this union, to make a new team and this new group that will carry Barca forward. And Valverde has this ability.&amp;rdquor;</p>
