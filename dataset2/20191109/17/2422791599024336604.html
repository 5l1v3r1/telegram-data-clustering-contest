      <p>TORONTO -- Authorities say a small plane crashed in Texas after dumping hundreds of litres of coloured water in another case of a gender reveal event gone wrong.</p>
      <p>The pilot reported that he was maneuvering at a low altitude in order to pour out 1,324 litres of pink water for the gender reveal, <a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/brief2.aspx?ev_id=20190908X51027&amp;ntsbno=GAA19CA535&amp;akey=1">according to a press release</a> put out by the National Transportation Safety Board.</p>
      <p>Things went wrong when the plane “aerodynamically stalled,” from moving too slow, the release said. The plane crashed into the ground and flipped upside down.</p>
      <p>The pilot reported that there were no issues with the plane before the gender reveal flyover that could have caused it to malfunction.</p>
      <p>There were two people on board the single-seat airplane, according to a Federal Aviation Administration inspector, but no major injuries were reported.</p>
      <p>Gender reveals -- the phenomenon of throwing a party featuring a stunt intended to reveal the expected gender of an infant -- have become more dangerous as the desire for a more impressive reveal has gone up, <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/pink-or-blue-some-gender-reveal-parties-take-dangerous-turn-1.4665553">researchers say.</a></p>
      <p>Last month, a 56-year-old woman <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/they-thought-they-built-a-clever-gender-reveal-device-it-turned-out-to-be-a-deadly-pipe-bomb-1.4657627">was killed at a gender reveal party</a> in Iowa after a homemade explosive sent shrapnel shooting outwards, instead of merely spraying colourful powder into the air.</p>
      <p>In 2017, a 47,000-acre wildfire was started in Arizona when an off-duty U.S. border patrol agent <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/video-shows-arizona-fire-started-with-gender-reveal-party-1.4194731">shot a target filled with blue powder</a> for a gender reveal, causing the target to explode.</p>
      <p>Other gender reveal mishaps have involved cars bursting into flames, and explosions big enough to create shockwaves that could be felt for kilometres.</p>
