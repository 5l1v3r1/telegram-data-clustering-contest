      <p>It's hard to keep up with <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/500259/6-Drastic-Ways-Christian-Bale-Changed-His-Look-Role">all of Christian Bale's dramatic weight changes</a> for movies. You know who's also tired of keeping up with them? Christian Bale.</p>
      <p>Granted, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2465697/christian-bale-admits-he-has-to-stop-changing-his-weight-so-much-for-roles">he's said that before</a>. But Christian Bale is 45-years-old now, fresh off a whiplash-inducing 70-pound drop from <i>Vice</i> to <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/2472343/ford-v-ferrari#related"><i>Ford v Ferrari</i></a>. If he hadn't just <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2458768/first-vice-trailer-shows-christian-bales-full-dick-cheney">gained a dad bod</a> to play Dick Cheney in <i>Vice</i>, he wouldn't have had such a massive weight loss to play professional race car driver Ken Miles in <i>Ford v Ferrari</i>. It's probably due to that huge movie-to-movie drop that he's finally ready to actually mean it when he says he's done.</p>
      <blockquote>I keep saying I’m done with it. I really think I’m done with it, yeah.</blockquote>
      <p>That's what Christian Bale told <i>CBS Sunday Morning</i>'s Tracy Smith for an interview airing this Sunday, November 10 at 9 p.m. ET on CBS.</p>
      <p>Christian Bale was joined by his <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2474273/ford-v-ferrari-trailer-watch-christian-bale-and-matt-damon-race-behind-the-wheel"><i>Ford v Ferrari</i> co-star</a> Matt Damon, who plays American auto designer/engineer Carroll Shelby in the biographical drama. Damon is also no stranger to major weight loss and gain for roles -- he's talked about his ill-advised diet to lose about 40 pounds for <i>Courage Under Fire</i>. But Christian Bale has basically made a career of that kind of extreme control, and Damon paid homage:</p>
      <blockquote>I had a great time watching him. He’s got an incredible monk-like discipline, like, when he had to lose – he went from Dick Cheney to this guy. So he had to lose 70 pounds.</blockquote>
      <p>Before <i>Vice</i>, Christian Bale was in <i>Hostiles</i>, and he told <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/christian-bales-secret-packing-40-pounds-play-dick-cheney-pie-lots-pie-154642733.html">Yahoo</a> he put on 40 pounds -- and shaved his head and bleached his eyebrows -- to go from Captain Joseph J. Blocker in <i>Hostiles</i> to former Vice President Dick Cheney in <i>Vice</i>.</p>
      <p>Apparently Dick Cheney was not a big fan of Christian Bale in <i>Vice</i>, either, since Bale was apparently told through a third party that Cheney wanted to pass on a message to call Bale a dick. He wasn't joking around, either.</p>
      <p>During their CBS interview, Christian Bale paid his own respects back to Matt Damon, but in a different way. Sounds like Bale has been the second choice for a few roles out there that Damon passed on:</p>
      <blockquote>I am very grateful to Matt because I wouldn’t have a career if it wasn’t for roles he passed on. There are many roles where I was told, ‘Oh, well, Matt doesn’t want to do it. So they went, ugh, all right, what about Bale?’ And then I got the role. So thank you for that, Matt.</blockquote>
      <p>I find it hard to believe Christian Bale isn't a director's first choice every time. But it's no secret that Matt Damon (<a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Matt-Damon-Rescue-Missions-Have-Cost-Hollywood-An-Insane-Amount-Money-102477.html">needs to be saved a lot on film</a>) has passed on a lot of roles -- in <i>Avatar</i>, <i>Brokeback Mountain</i>, <i>Star Trek</i>, <i>The Quick and the Dead</i>, <i>Daredevil</i>, etc. Apparently Damon was going to do <i>Rescue Dawn</i>, which ultimately starred Christian Bale, but <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Matt-Damon-Talks-About-How-He-Turned-Down-Avatar-Rescue-Dawn-23412.html">Damon's own mom talked him out of</a> going into the jungle and losing a bunch of weight.</p>
      <p>We'll have to see if Christian Bale sticks with his latest plan to stop the weight swings. <i>Ford v Ferrari</i> hits theaters this coming Friday, November 15, and so far it's <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/2479416/ford-v-ferrari-review">getting good reviews</a>.</p>
