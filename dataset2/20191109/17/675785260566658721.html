      <h1>KSI vs Logan Paul II undercard: Who is fighting before YouTube stars clash in ring?</h1>
      <h2>Billy Joe Saunders and Devin Haney defend their respective world titles before KSI and Logan Paul walk to the ring</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T17:00:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Domin, https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfighting</a></address>
      <p>All eyes will be on KSI and Logan Paul tonight when the social media stars make their walks to the ring for their rematch.</p>
      <p>The YouTube sensations will finally settle their beef at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, more than a year after fighting to a controversial draw in Manchester.</p>
      <p>But before they do, there is plenty of action on the undercard with two world championship fights as Billy Joe Saunders and Devin Haney defend their super-middleweight and lightweight titles respectively.</p>
      <p>Unlike the first fight, there will be no YouTubers on the undercard after promoter Eddie Hearn made it part of the deal if he was to come on board.</p>
      <p>Saunders will be due in the ring at around 2am UK time with Haney following on before the main event at 4am.</p>
      <p>Here is everything you need to know about the undercard...</p>
      <h3>What time do the fights start?</h3>
      <p>The fights are expected to start at around 4pm local time, which is midnight in the UK. Billy Joe Saunders should walk to the ring at around 6pm (2am UK) and will be followed by Devin Haney.</p>
      <p>The main event is scheduled to start at 8pm local time (4am UK).</p>

      <h3>Are the fights on YouTube?</h3>
      <p>No, unlike the first fight, the rematch will not be shown on YouTube despite KSI and Logan Paul having 40 million followers between them.</p>
      <h3>Who is fighting?</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Devin Haney vs Alfredo Santiago</b>
      </p>
      <p>Haney has quickly established himself as one the rising stars of the sport with his slick style and endearing personality. He won an interim lightweight title in September by beating Zaur Abdullaev and was recently upgraded to full champion when Vasyl Lomachenko was controversially upgraded to 'franchise champion'.</p>
      <p>Tonight Haney defends his title against Santiago who has won all 12 of his fights but who has never boxed outside of his home in the Dominican Republic.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Billy Joe Saunders vs Marcelo Esteban Coceres</b>
      </p>
      <p>Saunders is undoubtedly one of Britain's best boxers but he has endured a frustrating 12 months having given up his middleweight title after an abnormal drug test put paid to his defence against Demetrius Andrade.</p>
      <p>He was then fined £100,000 after a video emerged of Saunders telling a woman he will give her £150 worth of drugs to perform a sex act.</p>
      <p>But he returned to action earlier this year to win a vacant super-middleweight belt against Shefat Isufi at the home of Stevenage FC.</p>
      <p>He then left promoter Frank Warren and tonight makes his debut with Eddie Hearn having been promised the big fights in 2020.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Nikita Ababiy vs Jonathan Batista</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ababiy has been tipped for big things since turning pro with Matchroom and has knocked out all but one of his opponents thus far. Expect the same tonight.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Ronny Rios vs Hugo Berrio</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rios always brings excitement to the ring and is bidding to follow up on his shock win over Diego De La Hoya - son of ring legend Oscar - in July. Berrio is coming off three fights with namesake Argel after a no contest and two victories.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Diego Pacheco vs Aaron Casper</b>
      </p>
      <p>At only 18, Pachecho fights for the seventh time as a professional and the first at the Staples Center in home city of Los Angeles. He should have little trouble with 5-3-0 Casper.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Alexis Espino vs Gregory Clark</b>
      </p>
      <p>Another young gun, Espino, 19, from Las Vegas continues his professional career with his fifth contest and can expect another early night.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Reshat Mati vs Cody Peterson</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mati is a New Yorker who is yet to be tested in his four fights as a pro - don't expect that to change tonight.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Joshua Brueckner vs Tyler Smith</b>
      </p>
      <p>Both men are moving up from a minor MMA promotion to make their boxing debuts.</p>
