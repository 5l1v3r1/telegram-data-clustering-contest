      <h2>Stevie May netted a late consolation for the Perth side but it was too little too late</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T17:15:40+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 17:15</time> by <a rel="author">Perthshire Advertiser, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/perthshire-advertiser/</a></address>
      <p>St Johnstone’s hopes of piecing together a prolonged unbeaten run came to a crashing halt at McDiarmid Park on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Hibernian striker Christian Doidge did the majority of the damage by netting a hat-trick while Scott Allan also got in on the act.</p>
      <p>Stevie May grabbed a late consolation - his second since returning to the club - but Saints were comfortably beaten and dropped to second bottom of the standings.</p>
      <p>Perth supporters would be hoping defensive frailties displayed on numerous occasions this season had been banished after a recent clean sheet against Hearts.</p>
      <p>But one minute and 26 seconds into this Premiership fixture the home backline made life far too easy for capital neighbours Hibs to seize an early advantage.</p>
      <p>It was ignited by a simple long ball up the centre of the pitch. Skipper Jason Kerr slipped on the wet turf and Florian Kamberi took control to drive the attack forward.</p>
      <p>He cut-back across the face of goal for the unmarked Doidge who needed two bites of the cherry to eventually sweep low beyond Zander Clark from close range.</p>
      <p>That same combination linked-up in the 17th minute to extend Hibs’ lead to two as disgruntled home fans expressed their disappointment.</p>
      <p>The Swiss forward this time drilled a delivery into the box from the right flank, which Doidge neatly flicked into the back of the net.</p>
      <p>Saints had offered little but Scott Tanser did call Chris Maxwell into action as the half hour mark approached with a tame, right-footed attempt.</p>
      <p>Moments later Doidge, who hadn’t netted in the league until his trip to Perth, was inches away from grabbing an early third but couldn’t connect with Allan’s cross.</p>
      <p>Tommy Wright’s side needed to raise the tempo but further pain was inflicted when Allan neatly finished three minutes into the second half.</p>
      <p>Matty Kennedy gifted possession to the crafty midfielder and he proceeded to drive deep into Saints territory before getting the better of an outstretched Clark.</p>
      <p>Worse was to come when Doidge climbed above Perth defenders to nod in Jason Naismith’s cross with 58 minutes played.</p>
      <p>Substitute Callum Hendry was presented with a chance to pull back a late consolation but his touch evaded him when he needed it most.</p>
      <p>Strike partner May did grab a 90th minute goal, turning home Anthony Ralston’s cross after a front post run. But by this point the game was gone.</p>
