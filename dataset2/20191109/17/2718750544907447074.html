      <h1>Did You Know Lucy Liu Creates Beautiful Erotic Paintings?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T17:44:58+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 17:44</time> by <a rel="author">Katie Heaney</a></address>
      <p>In news that is likely to put many people on bed rest, <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2019/08/elementary-lucy-liu-joan-watson-character-analysis.html">the actor Lucy Liu</a> is also a visual artist who paints (among other things) lesbians entwined in bed. We would like to buy 12, though it’s not clear whether the paintings are for sale, and if they were, we’re unsure we can actually afford them. Perhaps we’ll take a <a href="https://twitter.com/dykedolores/status/1191455464522997760">screenshot of this tweet</a> and have that framed instead. Liu has been showing work in private and public art shows since 1993, <a href="https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-lucy-lius-longtime-little-known-art-practice-deeply-moving">according to Artsy</a>. Lesbian paintings are not her only medium; Liu also creates ink drawings, paintings, silkscreens, and collages out of her New York studio. Earlier this year, her “Lost and Found” collection of sculptures made of repurposed found objects was displayed at the National Museum of Singapore, and you can see even more of her work on her studio <a href="http://lucyliu.net/gallery/studio">website</a>.</p>
