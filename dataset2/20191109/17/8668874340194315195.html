      <p>Ospreys replacement fly-half <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/ospreys/players/james-hook/">James Hook</a> missed two late penalties as Southern <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/kings">Kings</a> hung on to register a 16-14 victory – their first Guinness Pro14 win of the season.</p>
      <p>Ospreys, who have now lost five out of six matches, had rallied from 16-0 down at the beginning of the second half with converted tries for number eight Morgan and wing <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/ospreys/players/hanno-dirksen/">Hanno Dirksen</a> in torrential rain at Swansea.</p>
      <p>But Kings had done enough in the first half with a try for centre <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/mitre-10-cup/teams/wellington/players/erich-cronje/">Erich Cronje</a> and 11 points from the boot of full-back Scott Van Breda.</p>
      <p>Ospreys’ poor form was not helped with nine players out injured, while a further eight are on an extended rest following the World Cup.</p>
      <p>But the region was boosted with new signing <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/ospreys/players/shaun-venter/">Shaun Venter</a> returning to the starting line-up.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The quality of the rugby by both sides was pretty poor in the opening exchanges not helped by persistent rain.</p>
      <p>But Kings were the better side throughout the first half and deserved their 13-0 interval lead.</p>
      <p>Kings thought they had a try after 12 minutes when number eight <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/mitre-10-cup/teams/wellington/players/elrigh-louw/">Elrigh Louw</a> went over following a line-out in the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/ospreys">Ospreys</a> 22, but he was denied the score because of a knock-on.</p>
      <p>However, the Ospreys had been offside, and Van Breda made no mistake with the resulting penalty.</p>
      <p>And it got better from the restart when fly-half John Jackson caught the ball and delicately chipped ahead for scrum-half Josh Allderman. Left wing <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/mitre-10-cup/teams/wellington/players/josiah-twum-boafo/">Josiah Twum-Boafo</a> and skipper <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/kings/players/howard-mnisi/">Howard Mnisi</a> combined before sending centre Cronje sprinting away over the line. Van Breda added the conversion.</p>
      <p>Ospreys were caught offside on halfway at the end of the first half and Van Breda produced a fine 50-metre kick to convert the penalty – the last action of the half.</p>
      <p>The poor quality of Ospreys’ first half was reflected by a change at the interval which saw Hook replace Luke Price.</p>
      <p>But despite Hook’s involvement Kings increased their lead to 16-0 with a penalty in front of the posts.</p>
      <p>Hook’s experience helped Ospreys upfield and after the forwards banged on the door for long enough number eight Morris dived over at the side of a ruck for the try. Hook converted.</p>
      <p>Hook suffered an accidental knee to the head and was replaced temporarily by Price while Kings had Cronje sin-binned for persistent offending.</p>
      <p>After a series of scrum resets which frustrated the crowd Ospreys got over the second time with Dirksen scoring with Price converting to cut the scoreline to 16-14.</p>
      <p>But they were unable to convert two late penalty chances for Hook, who returned to the action – one from 30 metres and one from just inside the Ospreys half.</p>
