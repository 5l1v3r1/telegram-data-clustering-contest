        <b>Michael Andretti has spoken to Fernando Alonso about running in the 2020 Indy 500 but he suggests a lot has to be done until a deal is made. The back-to-back F1 world champion needs an Indy500 win to achieve Motorsport's triple crown. </b>

      <p>Next season <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mclaren">McLaren</a> will participate full time in the IndyCar with the O'Ward-Askew duo. In the Indy500 the racing team from Woking could possibly put an extra car on the grid for Alonso if he would like to attempt the third part of the triple crown again. </p>
      <p>The first attempt Alonso made in the Indy500 was with the team of Mario Andretti. Fernando came close in 2017, but the Honda engine gave up the ghost. This is what he had to say about a future drive. </p>

      <p><i>“We’ve talked about it and I’d love to have him drive for us again. But a lot of things would have to happen,”</i> said Andretti in a conversation with<a href="https://racer.com/2019/11/08/alonso-andretti-for-2020-indy/"> Racer.</a> </p>
      <p>
        <i>“He has to decide what he wants to do and he could still end up with McLaren, but there’s other stuff. It’s a possibility, but not a good possibility. I’d love to get back together and try to get him his first win at Indy. We’ve talked about it many times — and also about him driving other things for us — but right now it’s just talk.”</i>
