      <p>NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman says the NHL plans to return to Europe for games in the next two years.</p>
      <p>Citing huge demand, Bettman said on Friday that the Boston Bruins and the Nashville Predators will open the regular season next year with a game in Prague. The Colorado Avalanche and the Columbus Blue Jackets will play a couple of games in the Finnish capital of Helsinki.</p>
      <p>Bettman did not specify dates for the games.</p>
      <p>He added that he is “pretty certain” that the NHL will return to Sweden in two years but gave no details about the teams involved and venue.</p>
      <p>Bettman was talking to reporters before the Buffalo Sabres and the Tampa Bay Lightning play the first of their two games in the Swedish capital of Stockholm.</p>
      <p>In October, the Philadelphia Flyers beat the Chicago Blackhawks 4-3 to open their season in Prague.</p>
