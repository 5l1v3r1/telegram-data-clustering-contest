        <b>Justice Mukheli was one of the South African photographers featured at the 4th edition of the Also Known As Africa (AKAA) contemporary art fair in Paris, running from 9 to 11 November.</b>
      </p>
      <p>45 galleries from 19 countries showcase artists from Africa. Among them, Justice Mukheli from South Africa's Dyman Gallery.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.justicemukheli.com/about-1">Justice Mukheli</a> grew up in the township of Soweto, Johannesburg.</p>
      <p>After working in advertising as an art director, he became a photographer "by chance," as he told RFI at the <a href="http://akaafair.com/en">AKAA Fair</a>.</p>
      <p>"South Africa is predominately black. But when I was working in advertising, photographs were not showing black people the way I see them, from a black person's point of view. "</p>
      <p>"When you google South Africa and Soweto, where I come from, you find images that do not truly represent the reality I know, and the reality of now. […] I realised that the biggest struggle now for South African youth is the way we are seen."</p>

      <p>In the work presented at the AKAA Fair in Paris, Mukheli shows a series of pictures representing two children named Thabelo and Maanda.</p>
      <p>Through the series, Mukheli captures emotions that he was told not to express as a child in the Soweto township in Johannesburg.</p>
      <p>"In my upbringing as a kid, I didn’t have much options or opportunities to express how I felt about things that made me sad. Crying, being sad or angry, anything that wasn’t happiness, emotions that, as boys, we were not allowed to feel."</p>
