      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kate-middleton-duchess-of-cambridge">Kate Middleton</a> has held talks with the boss of the BBC, sparking speculation that she could be lining up a secret TV project.</p>
      <p>The Duchess of Cambridge, 37, held private talks with BBC director-general Tony Hall at Broadcasting House in central London on Thursday afternoon.</p>
      <p>It came as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/prince-harry">Prince Harry</a>, 35, works on a Apple TV+ documentary series with chat show titan Oprah Winfrey - a pal of his wife <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/meghan-markle">Meghan Markle,</a> who is believed to have played a key role in the project's launch.</p>
      <p>Kensington Palace declined to comment on what was discussed during Kate's meeting and the speculation about a potential TV project.</p>

      <p>The duchess and Lord Hall of Birkenhead, 68, met at the BBC's London headquarters after she attended a meeting with the public broadcaster's children's and education team, according to the Court Circular.</p>
      <p>The meeting took place in her capacity as patron of the Royal Foundation, a spokeswoman for Kensington Palace said.</p>
      <p>Mirror Online has contacted the BBC for comment.</p>
      <p>Kate and husband Prince William, 37, set up the foundation and were running it with Harry and Meghan, 38,  until the Sussexes split off and set up their own charity earlier this year.</p>

      <p>Harry and TV titan Oprah, 65, are working on a documentary series on mental health for the new Apple TV+ streaming service.</p>
      <p>Details have been kept under wraps, but it is due to premiere in 2020.</p>
      <p>When it was announced in April, it had already been in development for several months.</p>
      <p>Harry said at the time: “I truly believe that good mental health - mental fitness - is the key to powerful leadership, productive communities and a purpose-driven self.</p>
      <p>"It is a huge responsibility to get this right as we bring you the facts, the science and the awareness of a subject that is so relevant during these times.</p>
      <p>"Our hope is that this series will be positive, enlightening and inclusive - sharing global stories of unparalleled human spirit fighting back from the darkest places, and the opportunity for us to understand ourselves and those around us better.</p>
      <p>"I am incredibly proud to be working alongside Oprah on this vital series.”</p>
