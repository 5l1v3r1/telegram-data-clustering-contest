      <h1>Austin MacPhee outlines his Hearts jobs credentials as he points to caretaker record</h1>
      <h2>The 40-year-old has been assistant under two managers and clearly fancies a more permanent managerial role.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T17:42:06+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 17:42</time> by <a rel="author">Mark McDougall, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mark-mcdougall/</a></address>
      <p>Austin MacPhee insists he and the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a> players got the best out of the Tynecastle atmosphere during their 5-2 thumping of St Mirren.</p>
      <p>The interim boss initially insisted he wouldn't comment on whether he had done himself any favours in getting the Hearts job before then reeling off his stats as a boss.</p>
      <p>This is MacPhee's second time taking charge of the first team - with the first coming when <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/craig-levein">Craig Levein</a> suffered a heart attack last year.</p>
      <p>He was in charge for wins over Kilmarnock, St Mirren and Motherwell before his second spell started with defeat to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> last week.</p>
      <p>This time he has ended Hearts' run of seven months without a home win, with the Jambos scoring five goals at home for the first time since 2016.</p>
      <p>And the Northern Ireland assistant reckons his record speaks for itself, insisting any club would be happy with that run of form.</p>
      <p>When asked about the Hearts job, he first said: "That’s not for me to comment."</p>

      <p>But he quickly continued and spoke about what he's done well at the club in a caretaker role, saying: "When I’ve been asked to step in as interim manager I’ve won four out of five of the games, that’s obviously a good record for any club and naturally an attacking performance with lots of goals and pressing is what the team wants no matter who the manager is.</p>
      <p>"I’m fully aware of the situation and I just want to do as good a job for Hearts as I can.</p>
      <p>"As I say I’ve won 4 out of 5 games when I’ve stepped in as interim coach, I thought today was a performance on the front foot and there was a lot of attacking play.</p>
      <p>"We’re disappointed with the goals we lost defensively but the team showed resilience and started fast and the team came out at the start of the second half fast, they showed that myself and the players can move forward with energy, move forward with togetherness and we got the best out of Tynecastle today.</p>
      <p>"We gave the supporters football that they want and it’s been a good day for the club."</p>
      <p>MacPhee insists he won't speak to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ann-budge">Ann Budge</a> specifically about the role with the international break to follow, but insists he'll begin preparing for the Kilmarnock clash in two weeks on the basis he'll still be in charge.</p>
      <p>He added: "I speak to Ann most days so nothing will change there. We have to make sure we take stock, hopefully this result with me taking the team for the time being gives everyone a chance to breathe and if we go to Kilmarnock and I’m still the interim manager at that point then hopefully we can get a similar performance from the players."</p>
