      <h1>Phoebe Waller-Bridge Teases How Good Her James Bond Script Is</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T17:10:51+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 17:10</time> by <a rel="author">Devon Ivie</a></address>
      <p>Earlier this year, it was reported that Mr. 007 himself, Daniel Craig, made <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/04/phoebe-waller-bridge-is-rewriting-the-new-james-bond-script.html">a personal plea</a> to <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/fleabags-phoebe-waller-bridge-celebrates-emmy-award-wins.html">gimlet goddess</a> Phoebe Waller-Bridge to rewrite <i>No Time to Die, </i>which will be the 25th film in the James Bond franchise. Luckily for us, she said yes, and we’re now getting some hot details about what to expect before the film’s <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/08/james-bond-no-time-to-die-movie-title.html">release in April</a> — and no, there’s probably not going to be a bunch of stale martini puns. “They were just looking for tweaks across a few of the characters and a few of the storylines,” Waller-Bridge told <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-50331077">the BBC</a> in a new interview, adding that she enjoyed adding “little spices” to everyone’s dialogue. “My involvement was much more practical. Just, ‘You’re a writer, we need some help with these scenes. And you come up with some dialogue for these characters.’”</p>
      <p>With her <i>No Time to Die </i>writing credit, Waller-Bridge will be the second woman in Bond film history to have contributed to a script. The BBC notes that the only other female writer involved in the franchise, Johanna Harwood, contributed to <i>Dr. No</i> and <i>From Russia With Love </i>in the early ’60s. As for her Bond writing process, Waller-Bridge said she bonded (heh) with Craig and discussed the script with him in New York before migrating over to the U.K. to spend “a lot of time” on set when filming began. “It doesn’t get cooler” than writing for the debonair secret agent, she added, seemingly forgetting about her <i>other </i>spy series <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/05/killing-eve-season-2-finale-bluebeard.html">with the good clothes</a>.</p>
