        <b>Absa Premiership</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Result:</b> Stellenbosch 0-0 Highlands Park</p>
      <p><b>Date:</b> 09 November 2019</p>
      <p><b>Venue:</b> Cape Town Stadium</p>
      <p>Ten-man Stellenbosch managed to secure themselves a point after hold Highlands Park to a goalless draw in the Absa Premiership on Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Iqram Rayners and Waseem Isaacs retained their spot at the top of the Stellies attack, while Alan Robertson and Afoakwa were drafted into the line-up following the loss to AmaZulu this week.</p>
      <p>Highlands have bit a of slump lately, which saw Mothobi Mvala, Thela Ngobeni and Sifiso Mbhele dropped to the bench, as Marlon Heugh, Mzava and Rodney Ramagalela were recalled.</p>
      <p>However, Stellies coach Steve Barker was forced into an early change as Mobbie, on loan from Mamelodi Sundowns, sustained an injury and was replaced by Bergman.</p>
      <p>After a slow start to the half, Highlands carved out the first chance at the midway point of the half but goalkeeper Boy de Jong produced a good save to keep the scores level.</p>
      <p>While it was the visitors who enjoyed more of the chances, the home side were dealt a blow just before the halftime break as veteran defender Morgan Gould received his marching orders after picking up two yellow cards in the first half.</p>
      <p>Despite being a man down, Stellenbosch held their own in the second half as the Lions of the North pushed for an opening goal in the first 15 minutes of the stanza.</p>
      <p>With both sides struggling to get the breakthrough, changes were introduced on both ends as Solomons replaced Rayners for the home side while Highlands threw on Marks Munyai for Mbhele.</p>
      <p>However, neither side could find an opening in the latter stages of the half as Stellenbosch find themselves in 13th spot, while Highlands remain in fifth spot.</p>
      <p>
