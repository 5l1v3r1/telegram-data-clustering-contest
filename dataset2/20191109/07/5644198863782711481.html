      <p>MELBOURNE: One person has been found dead and at least 100 homes have been destroyed as bushfires rage across eastern Australia, authorities said on Saturday (Nov 9).</p>
      <p>The New South Wales Rural Fire Service (NSW RFS) said early on Saturday that firefighters had discovered the remains of a person in a vehicle and two other people remained unaccounted for.</p>

      <p>NSW RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) that more dangerous fire conditions could be expected on Saturday.</p>
      <p>"I'm expecting to see those alert levels change throughout the day, probably worsen, more likely than not, as the afternoon winds pick up and the fire behaviour spreads a little more," Fitzsimmons told the ABC.</p>
      <p>This is one of Australia's worst bushfire seasons, with parts of the country facing the worst droughts in living memory.</p>

      <p>On Friday, NSW fire authorities issued a record number of emergency warnings, with 17 fires declared to be at an emergency level as high winds and dry-conditions saw fires spread rapidly.</p>
      <p>On Saturday morning, there were six emergency-level fires burning in NSW, with more than 70 fires across the state in total.</p>
      <p>Further north in Queensland, thousands of residents from the Sunshine Coast region spent the night in evacuation centres, after fire authorities told them to leave.</p>
      <p>The Queensland Fire &amp; Emergency Services declared one fire to be at an emergency level on Saturday morning.</p>
