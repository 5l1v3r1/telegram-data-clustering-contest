      <p>This year’s event celebrated 15 years of the Shooting Star Ball, and was hosted by Clary.</p>
      <p>Shooting Star Children’s Hospices offers care and support to babies, children and young people who have life-limiting conditions, as well as their families, throughout London and Surrey.</p>
      <p>The charity largely relies upon government funding and the generosity of its supporters to keep its service – which costs £10 million a year – running at its current level of care.</p>
