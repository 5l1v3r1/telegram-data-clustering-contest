      <p>Striker George Oakley says Hamilton need to learn to win again, after throwing away a lead against Ross County on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The striker bagged his fourth goal of the season in the 2-2 draw at New Douglas Park on Saturday, but while he says Hamilton are hard to beat and are scoring goals again, they must keep it tight at the back.</p>
      <p>Oakley, 23, said: “We all worked so hard and that’s the most we’ve been disappointed probably this season because we were 2-1 up and it was one long ball, a good touch by Michael Gardyne and a good cut-back, and we’ve just got to be better defensively.</p>
      <p>“I think we will learn from it, but we are very disappointed. We could have been going away happy guys, but we’re going away a bit disappointed because we should have taken all three points.</p>

      <p>“That would have been a massive win, but we’ve got to do better, all of us. We dominated the game and we should have just killed it.”</p>
      <p>Oakley was pleased to take his tally to four for the season and said: “I’ve been needing it, personally. We haven’t created many chances, but we’ve been working our socks off lately as a team, and I think that’s a credit to us all because we have been hard to beat.</p>
      <p>“On Saturday we were hard to beat but also scoring goals, but we need to win games now, so we’ve got to get the mixture right. Once we do that, I think we will be all right.</p>
      <p>“We can’t dwell on this though because then you’re going to turn up for the next game and not be at it. All we can do is get ready for the game at Kilmarnock.”</p>
