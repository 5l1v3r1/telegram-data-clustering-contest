      <p>MELBOURNE: Catastrophic bushfires in eastern Australia have killed at least three people and forced thousands from their homes, with the death toll expected to rise as firefighters struggle towards hard-to-reach communities.</p>
      <p>In the normally picturesque coastal town of Forster - one among dozens hit along the eastern seaboard - vast plumes of smoke shot out from multiple blazes as water bombers swooped in overhead.</p>

      <p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison said that, if needed, the military could be called on to help some 1,300 firefighters who are tackling around 100 separate blazes.</p>
      <p>Several people are still unaccounted for and 30 more have been injured - mostly firefighters working for hours on end in smoky, smouldering scrubland and blazing forests of towering eucalyptus.</p>
      <p>"My only thoughts today are with those who have lost their lives and their families," Morrison said, as hundreds of civilians also volunteered to help their hard-hit neighbours.</p>

      <p>A body was found in a burnt-out building near the east-coast town of Taree, police said, while another victim was found in a car and a woman died despite medics trying for several hours to save her.</p>
      <p>As hot and windy weather eased slightly on Saturday, the number of most serious fires fell to just a handful from an unprecedented 17 on Friday.</p>
      <p>But within an area spanning almost 1,000km, schools were burned and at least 150 homes were destroyed, while authorities were forced to evacuate detention centres and old people's homes.</p>
      <p>It was a narrow escape for Don Russell, with the fire coming within meters of his home in Taree.</p>
      <p>"They've done a top job them fellas," Russell told AFP after a crew of six firefighters brought the blaze under control.</p>
      <p>His next-door neighbours were not so lucky, however - their home went up in flames Saturday afternoon. No one was home.</p>
      <p>"It used to be God's country, but it ain't any more," said another neighbour, 72-year-old Dave Scott.</p>
      <p>New South Wales's rural fire service said an emergency warning was in place for four fires among the dozens raging across the state.</p>

        <b>TINDERBOX</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bushfires are common in Australia and a vast corps of firefighters had already been tackling sporadic blazes for months in the lead-up to the southern hemisphere summer.</p>
      <p>But this was a dramatic start to what scientists predict will be a tough fire season - with climate change and weather cycles contributing to the dangerous combination of strong winds, high temperatures and dry conditions.</p>
      <p>"We're experiencing tinderbox-like conditions across much of the state and all it takes is one spark to start a fire that may burn for days," said Queensland's acting fire commissioner Mike Wassing.</p>
      <p>Queensland declared a "fire emergency" on Saturday and banned the lighting of all outdoor fires.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile New South Wales premier Gladys Berejiklian warned that next week's weather forecast "could mean we're not through the worst of it".</p>
      <p>Morrison, whose government has played down the threat of climate change, sought to deflect questions about what impact it may have had.</p>
      <p>"Australia has been battling ferocious fires for as long as Australia has been a nation, and well before. And we will continue to do so," he said.</p>
      <p>
        <b>"TOO LATE TO LEAVE"</b>
      </p>
      <p>Firefighters had described the conditions Friday as "difficult" and "dangerous". In some areas, residents were stuck and told to simply "seek shelter as it is too late to leave".</p>
      <p>Local radio stopped normal programming and provided instructions about how to try to survive fires if trapped at home or in a vehicle.</p>
      <p>Across the central coast, smoke billowed high into the sky and residents posted images online of tangerine skies and storeys-high trees ablaze.</p>
      <p>Authorities said some of the fires were creating their own weather conditions - pyrocumulus clouds that enveloped entire towns.</p>
      <p>Despite easing conditions, a prolonged drought and high aridity levels will continue to make circumstances combustible.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, some of the same fires cloaked Sydney in hazardous smoke for days. On Saturday it was Brisbane's turn, with the fires enveloping the city centre in a veil of acrid fog.</p>
      <p>Swathes of Australia have gone months without adequate rainfall, forcing farmers to truck in water, sell off livestock or leave their land to lie fallow.</p>
      <p>Jim McLennan of La Trobe University said the bushfires were "unprecedented", coming so early in the season and in areas that usually have moist soils and vegetation.</p>
      <p>"However, the fire situation is consistent with our new world of bushfire threat associated with climate change".</p>
