      <p>Salman Khan’s <i>Dabangg</i> is one of the most profitable franchises of Bollywood. Producer Arbaaz Khan is all set to release its third installment this year and looks like there are few changes.</p>
      <p>According to<a href="https://www.news18.com/news/movies/dabangg-3-makers-to-drop-rahat-fateh-ali-khans-voice-for-naina-song-report-2377277.html"><i> News 18</i></a>, unlike its previous parts, <i>Dabangg 3</i> will not have a song featured by popular Pakistani maestro, Rahat Fateh Ali Khan. The first part featured Salman wooing Sonakshi by singing the soulful track <i>Tere Mast Mast Do Nain</i>.</p>

      <p>In<i> Dabangg 2</i>, <i>Tore Naina Bade Dagabaaz Re</i> made waves as the romantic track of the year. However, in the third part, fans will have to give his voice a miss.</p>
      <p>A source close to the project says, “<i>Dabangg</i> films’ songs have been hits and the <i>Dabangg 3</i> album is no exception. One of the reasons why the <i>Naina</i> songs of part 1 and 2 worked so well is because of Rahat Fateh Ali Khan’s melodious voice.”</p>

      <p>“Hence, Salman Khan got him on board for the romantic track of <i>Dabangg 3</i> as well. The recording went well and everyone was happy with the outcome, including music director duo Sajid-Wajid,” the source added.</p>
      <p>“However, the tensions then increased between India and Pakistan. An unofficial decision was taken that the industry should stop working with singers from across the border. Since Rahat saab is a Pakistani, Salman and the entire team decided to drop his voice and replace it with that of another singer.”</p>
      <p>The source refuses to divulge who replaced the voice of the legendary singer. However, the source tells, “Earlier a decision was taken to release the full audio of a song every three days. That’s not happening but all audio songs of the film will be out this month itself for sure.”</p>
