      <p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday thanked his Pakistan counterpart Imran Khan for appreciating India's sentiment on the issue of the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/kartarpur">Kartarpur </a>Sahib corridor.<br/> <br/>The corridor links Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Pakistan, the final resting place of Sikhism founder Guru Nanak Dev, to the Dera Baba Nanak shrine here.</p>
      <p> <br/>"I thank Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan Niazi. He understood India's feelings on the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/kartarpur">Kartarpur </a>corridor issue, gave respect (to it) and, worked keeping in view those feelings," the prime minister told a gathering at the BSF camp in Shikhaar Masiahan, about eight kilometres from the Dera Baba Nanak gurdwara.<br/> <br/>The prime minister also thanked the Pakistani workers involved in building the corridor.<br/> <br/>"I also want to thank the workers of Pakistan who worked at a fast pace to help in building the corridor on their side," he said.<br/> <br/>Donning a saffron turban on the occasion, PM Modi said he felt blessed to be on the holy land here to dedicate the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/kartarpur">Kartarpur </a>corridor to the country.<br/> <br/>The opening of the corridor and the integrated check post would bring "double happiness" to the people, he added.<br/> <br/>"I feel blessed that I am dedicating the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/kartarpur-corridor">Kartarpur corridor </a>to the country. At the moment, I am getting the same feeling which you get at the time of doing Kar Sewa (religious service)", he said.<br/> <br/>This corridor and Integrated Check Post will serve thousands of devotees each day, and take them to Gurudwara Darbar Sahib, he said.  </p>

      <p>The prime minister also congratulated the countrymen and Sikhs across the world, while inaugurating the corridor.<br/> <br/>He also flagged off the first batch of over 500 Indian pilgrims who will travel to the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Narowal district of Pakistan's Punjab province through the Kartarpur corridor, thrown open days ahead of the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev on November 12.<br/> <br/>"Paying obeisance at Gurdwara Darbar Sahib will become easier now due to the corridor. I express gratitude to the Punjab government, SGPC and all the workers who were involved in building this Corridor," the prime minister said.<br/> <br/>The Sikh Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee, the apex religious body of the Sikhs also honoured the prime minister with 'Kaumi Sewa Award' on the occasion.<br/> <br/>"The SGPC bestowed me with Kaumi Sewa award, which I dedicate at the feet of Guru Nanak Dev. Guru Nanak is not a legacy of Sikhs alone, but an inspiration for the entire humanity," said the prime minister, adding, "He is not only a Guru, but a thought." "When Guru Nanak Dev set out on his 'udasis' or long travels from Sultanpur Lodhi, who knew what changes they would usher?" he said.<br/> <br/>The prime minister said the Guru himself had proclaimed that the purpose of his 'yatras', were to "pull the society out of injustice, darkness and inequalities".<br/> <br/>He gave message of unity and brotherhood, said Modi, adding he also gave society the gift of "an economic system, based on truth, honesty and self-respect".<br/> <br/> </p>
