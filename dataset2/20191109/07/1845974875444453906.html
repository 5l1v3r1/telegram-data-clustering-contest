      <h4>Chelsea’s match against Crystal Palace comes at an interesting time, directly off the back of the manic Ajax match and leading into another international break. Roy Hodgson’s side is easy to predict on paper, but a bit harder to figure out in reality.</h4>
      <p>A number of players who have suited up for both sides at one point or another will be involved when Chelsea face Crystal Palace. Gary Cahill and Michy Batshuyai played in the other’s strip just last season. Mix all of that with wildly contrasting styles of play, and Saturday’s match will be fascinating to watch. These are some of the clashes that could decide the outcome.</p>
      <h3>1. Wilfried Zaha vs. Cesar Azpilicueta and Emerson</h3>
      <p>Any time Crystal Palace score a goal, it’s typically a safe bet that Wilfried Zaha was involved in some way. He’s been the club’s best player during its most successful period, and plenty of clubs around Europe would be happy to have him in their ranks (including Chelsea, apparently).</p>
      <p>That said, Zaha’s production this season has been sparse, bordering on non-existent. One assist and zero goals in the Premier League this year is shocking for a player of his standard. Perhaps even more concerning is that he leads the league in being dispossessed, with his 51 being 13 above the next closest player. It’s a testament to the rest of the team that <a href="https://www.whoscored.com/Regions/252/Tournaments/2/England-Premier-League"><b>Palace currently sit ninth in the table</b></a>.</p>
      <p>While that may sound promising from Chelsea’s point of view, those who watched the Watford match will know that Chelsea are more than willing to help struggling forwards get their season started. Gerard Deulofeu certainly had plenty of chances against Chelsea last weekend, and Zaha is basically a much scarier version of the Spaniard.</p>
      <p>So, can Cesar Azpilicueta and Emerson contain the Ivorian? Azpilicueta certainly has the defensive prowess, but may be lacking the physical traits to keep up with Zaha. Emerson has the physicality, but may not have the requisite guile.</p>
      <p>Since Zaha tends to drift around the field to find space, neither fullback should have to endure his all-out assault for the full 90 minutes. For Azpilicueta especially, who played the entire Ajax match, that will be a relief.</p>
      <p>You would imagine Zaha will like his odds of finally getting on the scoresheet, but if Chelsea’s backline can keep him at bay, this shouldn’t be a terribly difficult match.</p>
