      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Hartson believes the Swiss midfielder still has a future at the Gunners despite swearing at supporters during the 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T07:30:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 07:30</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Former Arsenal striker John Hartson says Granit Xhaka still has a future at the club if he can improve his performances on the pitch.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/breaking-granit-xhaka-stripped-arsenal-20819160">Xhaka was stripped of the captaincy</a> by Unai Emery after he gestured and swore at supporters while being substituted during the Gunners' 2-2 draw with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> last month.</p>
      <p>Emery also refused to rule out Xhaka moving in the January transfer window, saying: "We’re speaking a lot about that. It’s clear. There’s no more words about that."</p>
      <p>But Hartson, speaking ahead of a <a href="https://www.skiddle.com/whats-on/London/New-Moon/Laugh-your-nuts-off-this-Movember/13666813/">KP Nuts comedy gig</a> for men's health charity Movember, thinks Xhaka still has the opportunity to win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> supporters.</p>

      <p>"You win the fans back by being humble, being professional and putting in wonderful performances," Hartson said. "He's a good player, he's been playing for Arsenal for a number of years, and now he has got to take on a strong mentality to rise to the occasion.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes you have to find an inner strength, deal with what you've done, don't sulk and move on rather than throwing your toys out of the pram.</p>
      <p>"Yes, he will get a tough time from supporters initially, but this is where he's got to go and show the character that got him the captaincy in the first place.</p>
      <p>"Arsenal is never about one person or one manager. The club will be there in a hundred years, it is bigger than one player."</p>

      <p>Hartson does, however, believe Emery made the right decision in stripping Xhaka of the captaincy.</p>
      <p>"I do think there's a future for Xhaka at Arsenal but I think Emery had to be seen doing something and I believe he made the right decision," he added.</p>
      <p>"You simply can't react the way he did, and I think it was disrespectful towards the club and the supporters."</p>
