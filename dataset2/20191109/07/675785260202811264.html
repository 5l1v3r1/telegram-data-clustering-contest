      <p>Stacey has also had an energy-sapping row with trolls online, who accused her of feeding five-month-old Rex food too early.</p>
      <p>After being mum-shamed, Stacey brought in nutrition expert Charlotte Stirling-Reed to fight her corner.</p>
      <p>She said that Rex was 'ready to start weaning' despite not being six months old as yet.</p>
      <p>Stirling-Reed did clarify that "around six months" is the guideline when it comes to introducing food to babies.</p>
