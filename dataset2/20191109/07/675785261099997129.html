      <h1>Man forced to go to Germany to find money for a car after UK lenders reject him</h1>
      <h2>Ian Singleton discovered his credit score "didn't exist" after moving back to Doncaster to be near his family - what he did to turn it around</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T07:00:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">James Andrews, http://www.facebook.com/jameswritesmoney/</a></address>
      <p>If you're solvent, careful with money and generally sensible, it would make sense for a bank to want to lend you money - except that isn't always the case.</p>
      <p>In fact, there are a whole series of otherwise excellent candidates that are rejected out of hand because of reports that they never even knew existed - and that's exactly what happened to Ian Singleton.</p>
      <p>Ian, 49, had been serving abroad in the forces - and decided to stay on in Germany afterwards, until he moved back home in 2012 to be nearer his family.</p>
      <p>It was at that point that he discovered he simply didn't have a credit score worth mentioning.</p>
      <p>"The first time it dawned on me was an important thing," Ian, from Doncaster, told Mirror Money.</p>
      <p>"I went to get a car from the local dealer, found one I liked and then he came back and said: 'We can't get you finance for it, you don't have a credit score'."</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>It was the first time Ian had really thought about his score - as in Germany his experience had been that you go to your bank if you need a loan.</p>
      <p>So that's what Ian did. To get hold of a loan for a car he needed in Britain, he went back to his old bank in Germany where they already knew and trusted him.</p>
      <p>But before then he went home.</p>
      <p>"I spoke to my family and said, 'what's all this about credit scores' and people were properly vague about it," Ian explained.</p>
      <p>There was some idea about how it was based on debt and how good you were at paying it back, but little more than that.</p>
      <p>"Mum said it's probably a good idea to get a credit card," Ian said.</p>
      <p>So he did, using it to buy a Samsung Galaxy Tab then clearing the debt in good time.</p>
      <p>"That was step one," Ian said.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Since then he's been on a mission to find out exactly how his score works, and how to improve it.</p>
      <p>"I did some research on the internet and found out certain factors that build up your score, and a bit later I saw an advert for <a href="https://www.clearscore.com/">Clearscore</a>."</p>
      <p>Clearscore is one of a number of services that let you check your credit score free and offers tips on building it back up.</p>
      <p>"I though that's good, because it said 'free', so I downloaded it," Ian said.</p>
      <p>It was a revelation - teaching him about the sheer variety of things lenders take into account when making a decision on whether to offer you credit.</p>
      <p>And credit affects far more than just cars and loans - with everything from mobile phone providers to landlords to potential employers all known to look at reports before offering you a contract.</p>
      <p>"I learnt about things like being on the electoral register," Ian explained. So he signed up.</p>

      <p>Ian then went through the list of tips on his app one by one.</p>
      <p>It worked. His score is now 525 - rated as "excellent" and well above both the local area and the national average.</p>
      <p>"I noticed that when I went back for a car I had no problems," Ian said.</p>
      <p>And Ian's advice for anyone else encountering problems?</p>
      <p>"Learn what a credit score is, because without it you won't get anywhere," he said.</p>
      <p>"Credit is such an integral part of our lives you need to inform yourself as there will come a time it's vital."</p>
