      <p>BEIRUT (AP) — Lebanon’s president is meeting with several Cabinet ministers and top banking officials in search for solutions for the deepening financial and economic crisis.</p>
      <p>The country’s financial troubles have worsened since nationwide protests — initially against new taxes — snowballed into calls for the entire political elite to step down.</p>
      <p>Banks reopened Nov. 1 after a two-week closure amid the protests. But depositors have rushed to withdraw their money in recent days, while lenders imposed irregular capital controls.</p>
      <p>President Michel Aoun’s office says the meeting was attended by the ministers of economy and finance, as well as the central bank governor and the head of the banks’ association.</p>
      <p>Banks in Lebanon were closed Saturday for an extra day amid deepening turmoil and public anxiety over liquidity.</p>
