      <p><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/zimbabwe.html">Zimbabwe</a> has suspended imports of livestock and meat from South Africa for the second time this year after an outbreak of foot and mouth in the north of its neighbouring country.</p>
      <p>In a statement on Friday, the agriculture ministry called the move "a precautionary measure designed to prevent the spread of the infection into Zimbabwe".</p>

      <p>In January, Zimbabwe joined Botswana and the Kingdom of eSwatini, formerly Swaziland, in suspending meat imports from South Africa while following the outbreak of the highly contagious foot and mouth disease.</p>
      <p>Foot and mouth disease does not affect humans but poses a threat to cattle, goats and sheep.</p>
      <p>The agriculture ministry said it had been notified by South African veterinary services that the latest outbreak had been identified at a farm in Limpopo province, close to the border with Zimbabwe.</p>
      <p>Importation of live cattle, goats, sheep and pigs and related products had been suspended as authorities seek to identify the virus strain and extent of the outbreak, the ministry said.</p>
      <p>Zimbabwe imports livestock from South Africa for breeding as well as meat products.</p>
