      <p>Expressing its dissatisfaction with the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/supreme-court">Supreme Court </a>verdict that cleared the way for the construction of a Ram Temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya, the Sunni Waqf Board said on Saturday that it will seek a review of the judgment.</p>
      <p>The apex court directed the Centre to allot a 5-acre plot at an alternative place to the Sunni Waqf Board, one of the parties in the decades long contentious dispute, for building a mosque.</p>
      <p>"The Ayodhya verdict has a lot of contradictions. We will seek a review as we are not satisfied with the verdict," the board's lawyer Zafaryab Jilani said.</p>
      <p>It will take whatever legal recourse is possible, he said.</p>
      <p>It is not just to give inner courtyard to other party, he argued while appealing for peace and no protest.</p>
      <p>Jilani, however, added that certain aspects of the judgment can help improve secular structure of country.</p>
