      <h1>Andy Ruiz Jr makes Deontay Wilder vs Luis Ortiz rematch prediction</h1>
      <h2>Ortiz is out to shock Wilder in their rematch on November 23 - but Ruiz Jr reckons it doesn't end well for the Cuban</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T07:30:05+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 07:30</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Andy Ruiz Jr has revealed his prediction for this month's rematch between <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/deontay-wilder">Deontay Wilder</a> vs Luis Ortiz - and it's not good news for the Cuban.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/luis-ortiz">Ortiz</a> gave Wilder a huge test in their WBC heavyweight title bout last March before gassing out in the latter stages and being knocked out in the 10th round.</p>
      <p>He will again look to cause an upset in their rematch on November 23, with Wilder the overwhelming favourite to maintain his unbeaten record.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/andy-ruiz-jr">Ruiz Jr</a> - who is involved in a rematch himself when he defends his heavyweight titles <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/boxing/andy-ruiz-jr-explains-weight-20837912">against Anthony Joshua on December 7</a> - reckons it will be the outcome between Wilder and Ortiz.</p>
      <p>The WBA, IBF, WBO and IBO champion was asked for his prediction on the Wilder vs Ortiz while being interviewed by iFLTV.</p>

      <p>He said: "I think it's going to be the same outcome.</p>
      <p>"Wilder's the younger man, the stronger man.</p>
      <p>"Plus he's a good friend of mine, so I'm going to be cheering for him."</p>
      <p>Ortiz has warned Wilder he has learnt lessons from his defeat in their first fight - and is heading into their rematch <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/boxing/deontay-wilder-sent-warning-luis-20820001">confident of becoming world champion</a> .</p>

      <p>"Wilder knows and if he’s not prepared and taking me seriously, he’s in big trouble," Ortiz told Fighthub.</p>
      <p>"I saw there were mistakes I made in the fight, and what I've done is strengthen my preparation so that I don’t repeat that.</p>
