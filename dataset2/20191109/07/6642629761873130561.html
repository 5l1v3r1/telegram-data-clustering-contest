      <p>India's top court has ruled on the ownership of a centuries-old religious site claimed by both Hindus and Muslims. </p>
      <p>The Supreme Court on Saturday ruled that the site in Ayodhya in northern <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/india.html">India</a>, where Hindu mobs destroyed a 460-year-old mosque in 1992, must be handed over to a trust to oversee the construction of a Hindu temple, subject to conditions. A separate piece of land in Ayodhya would be given over to Muslim groups.</p>
      <p>The demolition of the Babri Mosque triggered some of the deadliest religious riots the country had seen since its independence in 1947.</p>
      <p>Muslims say they prayed at the medieval-era mosque for centuries while Hindus say their deity Ram was born at the site where the mosque stood before December 6, 1992.</p>
      <p>Here is a look at the key events surrounding the dispute.</p>
