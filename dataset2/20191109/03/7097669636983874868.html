      <h1>Trump says he hardly knows his EU ambassador</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T03:22:21+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 03:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/" target="_blank">CBSNews</a></address>
      <p>President Trump railed against impeachment Friday as he left for Georgia to meet with supporters and speak at a Black Voices for Trump Coalition rollout, and claimed he hardly knows U.S. Ambassador to the E.U. Gordon Sondland. </p>
      <p>Earlier this week, House Democrats released Sondland's October testimony and <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/sondland-testimony-read-the-full-text-of-eu-ambassadors-statement-in-impeachment-inquiry-today/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17">revised testimony</a>, in which Sondland appeared to admit there was a quid pro quo linking a public statement regarding the Bidens and Ukraine military aid, after earlier saying such a link didn't exist. Sondland — who Sen. Lindsey Graham has accused of working with Democratic operatives — donated $1 million to the president's inaugural fund.</p>
      <p>"I hardly know the gentleman," Mr. Trump told reporters on the South Lawn Friday morning, en route to fundraising engagements in Georgia. </p>
      <p>The president, who hadn't spoken to reporters for two days — a notable lapse for him — also told reporters he might release a transcript of an earlier phone call that he had with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. </p>
      <p>He said he's fine with having officials testify in the impeachment inquiry, but doesn't want to lend credibility to a "witch hunt" process.</p>
      <p>The president's Georgia trip comes as Democrats' <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-news/trump-impeachment-house-intelligence-committee-subpoenas-mick-mulvaney-2019-11-08-live-updates/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17">impeachment inquiry </a>ramps up, and as acting White House chief of staff defied a congressional subpoena to testify. Deputy associate Office of Management and Budget director Mark Sandy is also scheduled to testify before the committees conducting the impeachment inquiry today, and he, too, is not expected to appear.</p>
