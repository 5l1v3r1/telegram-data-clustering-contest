      <p>Isha Ambani has often been seen accompanying her mother Nita Ambani while attending high-profile parties or events hosted by her own family. But, the daughter of Asia’s richest family was seen taking a leaf out of her sister-in-law Shloka Mehta’s book last week when she decided to her own bit for the environment. She accompanied her mother to collect and recycle PET (polyethylene terephthalate) bottles as part of a campaign launched by Reliance Industries.</p>

      <p>Hello magazine shared photos of Isha and Nita Ambani supervising the culmination of ‘Recycle4Life programme’ as part of what was billed a ‘national campaign Swachata Hi Seva.’</p>
      <p>Sharing the photos of two famous members of the Ambani family, Hello magazine wrote on Instagram, “Nita Ambani, Founder and Chairperson Reliance Foundation and Isha Ambani, Director Reliance Retail and Reliance Jio Infocomm at the culmination of a drive to collect PET bottles across India. Reliance Foundation undertook a Recycle4Life programme as a part of national campaign Swachata Hi Seva. Employees of Reliance Industries Limited and it’s group companies along with vendors and partners collected 78 tons (39 lakh bottles) across the country.”</p>
      <p>Isha, who had dazzled in a maroon velvet <a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/entertainment/days-after-husband-anand-piramal-called-rude-isha-ambani-caught-in-candid-moment-at-mumbai-airport-dad-mukesh-ambani/271387/"><i>zari</i> blouse</a> with a <i>pista </i>green <i>benarasi </i>saree at a Diwali party hosted by her mother Nita recently, opted for a simple <i>chikan </i><i>kurta. </i>Her simplicity and the no-makeup look was reminiscent of how Shloka Mehta, wife of Isha’s brother Akash Ambani. A firm votary of charity work, Shloka has often been seen getting involved in charity works without caring about her looks.</p>

      <p>As expected, both Nita and Isha earned plaudits from netizens, who applauded the family for their concern towards our environment.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, a set of unseen photos of Shloka <a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/entertainment/incredible-when-nita-ambanis-billionaire-daughter-in-law-shloka-mehta-worked-at-dirty-mumbai-railway-station/271246/">showing her work</a> at a Mumbai railway station attempting to paint the foot overbridge had set the internet on fire.</p>
