      <h2>After 4-1 loss, Vancouver now 0-2-1 in last three outings</h2>

      <p>WINNIPEG — Kyle Connor had a goal and an assist as the Winnipeg Jets handed the Vancouver Canucks their third straight loss with a 4-1 victory on Friday.</p>
      <p>Jack Roslovic, Mark Scheifele and Adam Lowry, with an empty-net goal, also scored for the Jets (9-7-1), who have points in their last four games (3-0-1).</p>
      <p>Connor Hellebuyck made 31 saves for Winnipeg, which has won nine consecutive games against the Canucks.</p>
      <p>J.T. Miller scored his team-leading eighth goal of the season for the Canucks (9-5-3), who’ve gone 0-2-1 in their past three outings.</p>
      <p>Thatcher Demko stopped 31 shots for Vancouver, which was coming off a 5-2 road loss to Chicago the previous night.</p>
      <p>Winnipeg made changes to its top two lines because of veteran centre Bryan Little’s injury in Tuesday’s loss to New Jersey. The puck from a one-timer shot by teammate Nikolaj Ehlers hit Little near his left ear, perforating his eardrum.</p>
      <p>Jets right-winger Blake Wheeler was moved to play centre on the second line between Ehlers and Roslovic. Scheifele was in the middle of Connor and Patrik Laine.</p>

      <p>The first period was scoreless and Winnipeg led 2-1 after the second.</p>
      <p>Vancouver outshot the Jets 13-9 in the first frame, which included an early scare when Ehlers was tripped up by the stick of Canucks defenceman Tyler Myers, who signed as a free agent July 1 after five seasons in Winnipeg.</p>
      <p>Ehlers slid into the boards and was down for a couple minutes, but skated slowly to the bench and quickly returned to the game.</p>
      <p>Later in the period, Myers was recognized by the arena announcer for his time with the Jets and received cheers from the crowd at Bell MTS Place.</p>
      <p>Miller got Vancouver on the scoreboard when he re-directed a shot by Troy Stecher past Hellebuyck at 6:53 of the second period. Miller has two goals and a pair of assists in a four-game point streak.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The Jets had a pair of power plays 16 seconds apart in the middle period and capitalized on the second one when Roslovic flipped in his own rebound at 11:54 to tie it 1-1.</p>
      <p>Scheifele broke the tie exactly five minutes later when he used a rebound off a Connor shot to beat Demko.</p>
      <p>Canucks defenceman Chris Tanev took a hard shot to his right leg from Laine earlier in the period and limped to the dressing, but returned to action.</p>
      <p>Winnipeg had a 28-22 advantage on shots on goal after the second.</p>
      <p>Just nine seconds after Hellebuyck made a glove grab on a close-in shot by Bo Horvat, Connor stole the puck from Myers and went in alone to beat Demko with a high shot at 13:35 for his his sixth goal of the season.</p>
      <p>Facing an empty net, Jets forward Andrew Copp passed back to Lowry so he could score his first goal, and his first point, of the season with 1:45 left in the third.</p>
      <p>Winnipeg plays the third game of its four-game homestand Sunday afternoon against the Dallas Stars. Vancouver goes home for four straight games starting Sunday against New Jersey.</p>
