      <p>A schoolgirl killed by a train had tried to climb back onto a platform moments before she was fatally struck, an inquest heard.</p>
      <p>Tragic Kate Mullins, 16, was concerned about her impending GCSEs and her appearance leading up to her death.</p>
      <p>CCTV footage showed Kate climbing onto the tracks at a station when a train approached.</p>
      <p>But the inquest was told she appeared to have changed her mind and was seen trying to climb up the platform at the last second.</p>
      <p>Unable to pull herself up, she turned to run away from the train, the Bournemouth court heard.</p>
      <p>Despite the driver's effort to pull the train to a halt, Kate was struck at 65mph.</p>
      <p>She died from multiple injuries at the scene.</p>
      <p>The out-of-service Cross Country train didn't have any passengers on at the time of the collision at Pokesdown station, near Bournemouth, Dorset.</p>
      <p>An inquest into Kate's death was held in Bournemouth, where coroner Brendan Allen heard evidence from Katie's mother Donna.</p>
      <p>She told the hearing that despite feeling anxious about her upcoming GCSE exams and had felt like throwing herself under a car but said she had no intention of doing so.</p>
      <p>In a statement Donna said: "She was into her fitness and had lost a lot of weight.</p>
      <p>"I think she felt anxious about her appearance and used to think people did not like her.</p>
      <p>"She was very well liked and did not know how much she was liked.</p>
      <p>"She was due to take her exams in art and design, business studies, English and maths and I know she was feeling anxious."</p>

      <p>Donna said her brother was the last family member that saw her leaving their home to work at a local pub on the evening of March 17.</p>
      <p>But Kate never showed up and Donna reported her missing to the police.</p>
      <p>"I cannot think of any reason that she would want to commit suicide," she said.</p>
      <p>"She had everything to live for, I miss her now and I will miss her for the rest of my life."</p>
      <p>Kate was a Year 11 student at Highcliffe School and was a member of St John Ambulance Service.</p>
      <p>Patrick Earnshaw, the head teacher of Highcliffe School, said: "She worked very hard, took her studies seriously.</p>
      <p>"She was not any more or less anxious about her exams that any hard-working student keen to do so at this time."</p>
      <p>He said she had also met with the school nurse who said she showed no signs of any suicidal thoughts.</p>
      <p>The CCTV showed Kate at the railway station at 8.25pm. She was seen to sit on a bench for five minutes before lowering herself on to the track.</p>
      <p>Train driver Andrew Barrett said he approached the station at about 60 or 65mph.</p>
      <p>He said: "I saw a female on the tracks half way down the platform. It looked like she was trying to climb back onto the platform.</p>
      <p>"About two seconds later the train struck her."</p>
      <p>Assistant Dorset coroner Brendan Allen recorded a verdict of misadventure.</p>
      <p>He said: "She was anxious about her exams and had issues with her self-esteem. I do not think there is evidence of suicide as we have heard she tried to pull herself back up onto the platform.</p>
      <p>"I find Kate died as a result of a misadventure.</p>
      <p>"Kate's death is undoubtedly a tragedy. It shows the dangers associated with entering onto the train tracks.</p>
      <p>"I would like to pass on my sincere condolences to Kate's family."</p>
