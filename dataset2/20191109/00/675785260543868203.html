      <p>Billy Joe Saunders has explained how he helped prevent boxing pal <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tyson-fury">Tyson Fury</a> committing suicide.</p>
      <p>Fury has previously opened up on his battle with depression, and has revealed that he came close to killing himself during his darkest days.</p>
      <p>Things appear to be on the up for the Gypsy King at the moment, with Fury having <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/other-sports/wrestling/tyson-fury-teams-up-braun-20844532">made his latest WWE appearance at Smackdown</a> in his home town of Manchester on Friday night.</p>
      <p>He teamed up with Braun Strowman - who he previously knocked out at last week's Crown Jewel event - with the pair making light work of the B Team duo of Axel and Dallas at Smackdown.</p>
      <p>Lineal heavyweight champion Fury is now set for a return to boxing for his proposed rematch with American <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/deontay-wilder">Deontay Wilder</a> in February, after the WBC made him mandatory challenger to the world heavyweight title.</p>

      <p>But Saunders, who has been friends with Fury since they were in England squads together at the age of 15, remembers darker times for Fury.</p>
      <p>The WBO super middleweight champion has told of how he had to remind Fury of his responsibilities as a father in early 2016 after the Gypsy King told him he was contemplating suicide.</p>
      <p>Saunders had invited Fury on a training camp where he introduced him to trainer Ben Davison - but shocked when he saw the state of him.</p>
      <p>"When he came over, when he came walking through the airport I thought 'f***ing hell what a mess, I didn't even recognise him," Saunders told Matchroom Boxing's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=532&amp;v=BwsKlca2HIc&amp;feature=emb_title">Born Fighter series</a> .</p>

      <p>"This was in early 2016. That night I had a chat with him for about two hours and he was talking about suicide and everything else.</p>
      <p>"I said, look, why the f**k are you talking about suicide to me now? I said, 'If you went and commit suicide who's going to look after your son, who's going to look after your daughters and your missus?</p>
      <p>"What, someone gonna say my dad was world champion and then he committed suicide?</p>
      <p>"What are you giving him to look up to? What's he going to get out of life? What's he going to do?</p>

      <p>"I literally put his kids there because I knew that was the only thing he could really care about at that time.</p>
      <p>"I knew he didn't care about money, he didn't care about anything else, didn't care about fame, boxing, nothing.</p>
      <p>"The only thing you really care about in that situation is your kids."</p>

      <p>"When you see him in that state to up there where he's at now... What impresses me the most is seeing him in such a horrible state to where he's at now.</p>
      <p>"I'm happy and glad to see where he's at now and the way he's fighting, because at one stage he was going to 100% commit suicide."</p>
