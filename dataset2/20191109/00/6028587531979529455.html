      <p>As we head full force into the 2019 holiday movie-going season, Hollywood is faced with the very real possibility that it will end up below 2018’s record setting box-office take. That will most certainly cue the Chicken Little The-Sky-Is-Falling articles about how antiquated going to the movies is and how streaming will be the death knell for an industry that has somehow seemed to weather any storm thrown at them since the days when Cecil B. DeMille was making “pictures”, as they were called at the time.But if you dig a bit deeper into the numbers you’ll be rewarded with an understanding that, if all goes as expected these next two months, Hollywood could top off at $11.3-$11.5 billion which would land it squarely at the #2 position in all-time yearly box-office totals, just behind 2018’s monumental $11.82 billion plateau. And before the pundits start attributing that strong box-office haul to rising ticket prices, it needs to be pointed out that <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/10/movie-ticket-price-average-admissions-box-office-third-quarter-2019-1202762586/">the average cost of going to the movies actually<i> fell</i> in Q3 2019.</a></p>
      <p>The motion picture industry has historically been the whipping boy among many followers who, when business is down year-to-year as it is with its current 6% deficit, are eager to proclaim the industry to be hopelessly out of touch, outmoded, and use a cornucopia of synonyms for the word “death” more appropriate for Monty Python parrot sketches than cinema-going statistics. If sales for fleece comforters or Ruffles are down 6% one year then up the following year no one all of a sudden proclaims that people have stopped getting chilly or have suddenly lost their taste for stackable chips.</p>
      <p>Having said all that, where are we now? After a tough start to the 2019 campaign where the industry was down double digits from the prior year, films such as <i>Avengers: Endgame, The Lion King, Toy Story 4, </i>and <i>Spider-Man: Far From Home </i>made Summer 2019 one of the most successful in recent memory and narrowed that gulf. Sure there were misses (I’m looking at you, <i>Dark Phoenix</i> and <i>Men in Black: International)</i> but this summer proved what Hollywood insiders have known for some time now, that the industry will live or die based on whether moviegoers want to see the big budget sequels and remakes which have driven box-office for the past few decades and especially so in the 2010s. 2018 was dominated by new installments of <i>The Avengers, Jurassic Park, Mission: Impossible, The Incredibles, Deadpool </i>and <i>Ant-Man</i> franchises, all of which were successes. That was the primary reason for 2018 year grabbing a choke-hold on the record books. 2017’s sequels and remakes, however, featured films that were geared more to international audiences where the franchises still had some heft in the tank such as <i>Pirates of the Caribbean, Kong, Planet of the Apes, </i>and<i> Transformers.</i> Domestic box-office, not surprisingly, suffered accordingly.</p>
      <p>Paul Dergarabedian, Senior Media Analyst at <i>Comscore</i>, concurs by saying, “It should be noted that comps to last year’s record-breaking pace were always going to be tough and when we look at the YTD vs. 2017 we are actually 4.5% ahead of that year at this point. Taken in this context the industry is at least holding its own and, in my view, this should be seen as a win given the myriad options for content available.”</p>
      <p>Echoing these statistics, <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/amc-entertainment-delivers-mixed-q3-results-as-attendance-sets-record-1202780023/">AMC announced its Q3 earnings last week</a>. Results were generally mixed with a loss of 53 cents per share but with a rise in attendance of 4% and an increase in food and beverage per capita. To reiterate, these results were measured against 2018’s record setting year. So while they may have been labeled as tepid by Wall Street analysts, the circuit has to be heartened by these results when laid against the most successful year Hollywood has ever had.</p>
      <p>As strong as 2018 was at the box-office, that year’s holiday films were a mixed bag which gives Hollywood a glimmer of hope that it could possibly eke out a box-office repeat of 2018. Though it included hits like <i>The Grinch, Bohemian Rhapsody</i> and <i>Aquaman</i>, it didn’t have the mega-hit anchor that 2019’s holiday should have with new installments of the <i>Star Wars</i> and <i>Frozen </i>franchises. Looking at the possibility of 2019 matching 2018’s assault on the record books, Daniel Loria, Editorial Director at Boxoffice Pro states, “The last six weeks of 2019 will determine just how much ground we’re going to make up against 2018. A trio of anchor titles like <i>Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker, Frozen 2</i>, and <i>Jumanji: The Next Level</i> should carry most of the weight in closing that gap.”</p>
      <p>Outside of that Gang of Three there is a group of solid titles who could eclipse the century mark as well. Loria continues, “The big question is how non-franchise titles such as <i>Ford v Ferrari, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood</i>, and <i>Little Women</i> perform in the market. We expect each of those titles to hit $100 million, but they have the potential to break out beyond that.”</p>
      <p>Most certainly, cinema chains are keeping a close eye on how the influx of streaming services from major players such as Apple and Disney will effect movie-going. While some may predict that content consumers will want to spend their holidays exploring Disney+ or Apple TV+ offerings it’s difficult to imagine a parent telling their child that instead of taking them to the cinema to see <i>Frozen 2</i> they will plant them in front of the Samsung to watch <i>The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again</i> or a <i>Star Wars</i> fan deciding to pass on <i>Rise of Skywalker</i> so he or she can watch <i>Solo: A Star Wars Story</i> for the second time.</p>
      <p>Granted, viewership numbers for these content services, though none are ever formally announced, should be impressive. What is difficult to imagine, however, will be that it will come at the expense of Hollywood’s holiday blockbusters. Early indications have shown that both movie-going and streaming consumption can co-exist. Netflix and Amazon have enjoyed solid subscriber numbers for several years, yet 2018, as mentioned, was a record year at cinemas in North America and around the world. Will the plethora of new options available to content consumers result in their passing on low- to mid-range films in theaters? Quite possibly, as studios have been seeing a steady box-office decline in these types of under-the-radar films for some time now.</p>
      <p>However, as anyone who follows the film industry closely will tell you, whether or not the year can be labeled a success does not primarily rely on whether movie-goers come out for <i>The</i> <i>Best of Enemies, Stuber,</i> or <i>The Kitchen,</i> but rather whether franchise entries and IP-driven reboots meet or exceed expectations. That shouldn’t be difficult considering the strength of this holiday season’s offerings, which should make 2019, despite click-bait headlines that might suggest otherwise, one of the most successful in Hollywood history despite the well-publicized streaming blitzkrieg and all efforts to drag it into the box-office mud.</p>
