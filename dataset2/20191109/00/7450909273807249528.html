The footage is believed to be of a black man in his early 20s, between 5-foot-8 and 5-foot-10 and weighing approximately 200 pounds. The man was observed leaving the area in a silver or gray late 2000s model Lincoln Town Car.</p>

      <p>On Thursday, the Auburn Police Division identified the man in the footage as Ibraheem Yazeed, who is 30 years old and is from Montgomery, Alabama. The <a href="https://news.auburnalabama.org/article/Public%20Safety/3221">police announced</a> that there has been a warrant issued for the arrest of Yazeed for first-degree armed kidnapping. The official statement writes, "Yazeed is currently out on bond for the charges of kidnapping and attempted murder from another jurisdiction. He should be considered dangerous and potentially armed."<br/><br/>Blanchard was reported missing on Oct. 24. Shortly thereafter, her black 2017 Honda CRV was recovered by police from an apartment complex with damage that was not present that last time it was seen in Auburn. Police believe that foul play may be involved in Blanchard’s disappearance.<br/><br/>A reward of more than $105,000 is being offered for information on Blanchard’s location, according to the report.<br/><br/>Harris recently withdrew from a headlining clash against <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Alistair-Overeem-461">Alistair Overeem</a> at UFC on ESPN 7 on Dec. 7 to focus on the search for his stepdaughter.</p>
