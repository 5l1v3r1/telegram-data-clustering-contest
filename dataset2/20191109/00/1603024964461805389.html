      <p>The Muslims of the sub-continent will always remain indebted to the great visionary leader for his invaluable services, Khan said in his message.</p>
      <p>Prime minister Khan said it was an occasion to recall and pledge for the nation to follow Iqbal's message of self-awareness and self-esteem.</p>
      <p>The great leader had also envisioned the idea of a separate homeland for the Muslims of the sub-continent and made remarkable contributions towards understanding the true message of Islam, Khan said.</p>
      <p>The prime minister urged the nation to pledge on this day to make even greater efforts for the fulfilment of the dream of "our forefathers and move forward according to the teachings of Iqbal for the greater good of our society".</p>
      <p>Born in Sialkot on November 9, 1877, Iqbal is considered one of the most important figures in literature with literary works in both Urdu and Persian languages. Asrar-e-Khudi, Payam-i-Mashriq, Bang-i-Dara, Bal-i-Jibril, Zarb-i Kalim and Armughan-e-Hijaz are among his best works.</p>
      <p>Widely regarded as having inspired the Pakistan Movement, the eminent poet was also a philosopher, academic and a barrister. Iqbal died on April 21, 1938.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
