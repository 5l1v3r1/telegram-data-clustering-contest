      <h1>Simms hits late 3s, No. 25 VCU holds off North Texas 59-56</h1>

      <p>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) - Mike’L Simms didn’t care that he had missed all six of his shots when the ball came to him with just over two minutes to play.</p>
      <p>When he let fly from the top of the key, it gave No. 25 VCU three critical points in what became a 59-56 victory against North Texas on Friday night.</p>
      <p>The Mean Green responded with a 3-pointer of their own by DJ Draper, but Simms hit again from the top of the key with the shot clock running down.</p>
      <p>“My teammates trust me and I trust myself,” Simms said.</p>
      <p>Marcus Evans led VCU (2-0) with 13 points and De’Riante Jenkins had 12, including two free throws with 10.5 seconds left.</p>

      <p>The Mean Green (1-1) had a chance to tie it but never got off a shot against the Rams’ tight defense.</p>
      <p>“That was a grind,” Rams coach Mike Rhoades said. “It was a good test for us even though when we got the lead we couldn’t keep it.”</p>
      <p>North Texas trailed most of the night but went ahead 48-47 on Draper’s 3-pointer with 5:25 to play. Jenkins answered with two free throws, and after a miss at the other end, Corey Douglas scored on a putback for the Rams, just their second field goal in 12 attempts.</p>
      <p>After two free throws by Umoja Gibson pulled North Texas within 51-50, Simms connected on a 3-pointer from the top of the key, his first field goal in seven tries. He did it again with 1:10 to play after Draper’s fourth 3-pointer pulled the Mean Green to within 54-53 with 1:41 remaining.</p>

        <p>Early in the season, tense final minutes are “huge,” Rhoades said. “It’s great for guys to go through that.”</p>
        <p>The atmosphere was great for the Mean Green, coach Grant McCasland said, but the outcome was not.</p>
        <p>“We gave ourselves a chance to win,” he said. “Extremely disappointed that we didn’t.”</p>
        <p>The Rams trailed 19-11 before holding North Texas scoreless for more than nine minutes while scoring 20 consecutive points. Jenkins had eight points in the burst, and Malik Crowfield and Evans hit 3-pointers. The Mean Green had 13 turnovers in the opening half, nine during the Rams 20-point blitz.</p>
        <p>“You turn the ball over to this group and they start going up and down, it’s over,” McCasland said.</p>
        <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
        <p>North Texas: The Mean Green had 13 first-half turnovers that led to 16 VCU points, but they turned that around in the second half with just five more giveaways.</p>
        <p>VCU: The Rams were outscored 26-10 in the paint and 16-7 on second-chance points as Marcus Santos-Silva, who had 21 points and 18 rebounds in their opener, was quiet, finishing with just three points and seven rebounds.</p>
        <p>UP NEXT</p>
        <p>North Texas plays at Arkansas next Tuesday night.</p>
        <p>The Rams face former coach Will Wade and No. 22 LSU next Wednesday night.</p>
