      <p>They had turned things round after their worst start to a campaign in 25 years. Buoyed by the returns of Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez to full fitness, FC Barcelona embarked on an impressive seven-game win streak in all competitions and rose to the top of both La Liga and their Champions League group as a welcomed consequence. Things were looking up, and with victories against Levante, Slavia Prague and Celta Vigo prior to the international break, the Blaugrana could not only smash a record run under Ernesto Valverde by ammasing 10 victories, but also consolidate their leads domestically and on the continent.</p>
      <p>As it turned out, Barça fell at the first hurdle of this fresh challenge. Beaten soundly by mid-table Levante in Valencia by conceding three goals in seven minutes, they drew 0-0 with their Czech opposition midweek and were booed off by the Camp Nou faithful.</p>
      <p>This evening in Spain, at 15.00 ET in the United States, they will attempt to get back on track with a victory over relegation-threatened Celta Vigo. By taking a quick look at the calendar, though, the extent of the arduous schedule that lies ahead of them at the end of 2019 and could define their season is revealed.</p>
      <p>Granted they will take a break for a fortnight, however with South American stars such as Messi, Suarez and Arthur heading to the Middle East to represent their countries, and others possibly picking up knocks elsewhere, it is hoped that players across the squad will not return to club duties injured or fatigued.</p>
      <p>At least their first game back, against bottom-ranked Leganes on the 23rd, is not too big a task to navigate. But four days later, an in-form Borussia Dortmund edging nearer to the summit of the Bundesliga, while having roared back to beat Inter 3-2 last time out and almost topping Barça in Germany, must be overcome at the Camp Nou.</p>
      <p>The following weekend, their toughest test yet awaits them in the Spanish capital where they face fellow title-aspirants Atletico Madrid at the Wanda on December 1st. Suffering all three of their defeats away from home this term, we all know how they have performed on the road as of late and Diego Simeone’s men will smell blood.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, after what will be a gruelling battle against a defensivelt-water tight outfit, Barça will be granted six or seven day reprieve. On the following weekend, they face Mallorca at home, but although currently languishing one spot above the drop zone in 17th, it is an outfit that gave Real Madrid their first loss of the season last month.</p>
      <p>December 10th involves a trip to Milan, where by beating Inter, FCB will aim to finish the first phase of the Champions League as group winners and, in a bid to not invoke the ghosts of Roma and Anfield, play the return leg of any Last 16 fixture in Catalonia.</p>
      <p>Then come the last two ties of the year. First, on either the 14th or 15th, a trip to the Basque country is in order to face current leaders - that is until Los Blancos and Barca have both played today - in Real Sociedad. After that is out of the way, it is the big one - El Clasico - at the Camp Nou on the 18th, which was rescheduled due to political clashes and turmoil in Catalonia at the start of October.</p>
      <p>By the end of all this, we will have a true gauge on the quality of this FC Barcelona team and what it is made of. They could end 2019 atop of La Liga and with the best possible trajectory in the Champions League, or trailing behind their fellow Spanish foes and facing a second leg travelling across Europe which in recent history has not favoured them well.</p>
      <p>Though it is unlikely a midway replacement will be made, the fate of Ernesto Valverde could be further decided at the turn of 2020 depending on how things pan out.</p>
