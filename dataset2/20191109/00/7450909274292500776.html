I hope he hears about this, and if he catches sight of me, it’s on sight.”<br/><br/>“I won’t be looking for him -- I’ll be looking to do my own thing -- but if I catch a glimpse, you know, I might sneak over,” Perry said.<br/><br/>“Maybe he’s looking for clout because he can’t get none with that crotch-sniffing style.”</p>
