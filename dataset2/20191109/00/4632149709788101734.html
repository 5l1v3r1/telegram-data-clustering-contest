      <p>After several complaints from parents that private institutions and coaching classes were wooing students from Second Pre-University colleges with high marks and ranks, the Department of Primary and Secondary education has finally taken cognizance of the situation. It is mulling not involving PU lecturers teaching in private institutions in setting question papers for the II PU board examinations. <br/><br/>The Ministry of Primary and Secondary education held a meeting on Friday to discuss how to go about with the examination process this year. The Ministry called upon all former PU Education board directors to share their experiences and methodologies adopted in the previous year’s examinations. S Suresh Kumar, Minister for Primary and Secondary education chaired a meeting with the PUE director Kanagavalli, former directors C Shikha, Ramegowda and other department officials. <br/><br/>The minister said that this year’s priority will be to cut down question paper leaks or any sort of nuisance during the II PU board examinations which is set to begin from March 4, 2020. Suresh Kumar said, “We want to strengthen the security process even further. Our aim is to curtail malpractices.” <br/><br/><br/>The officials in the department are chalking out a plan to exclude lecturers from private PU colleges. A senior official said, “People have turned this into a business. They lure students by telling them they know most of the obvious questions that will be appearing in the question paper.” <br/><br/><b><u>No common board<br/></u></b><br/><br/><i>* The Primary and Secondary education ministry took an U-turn on the decision of merging SSLC and PU boards under one umbrella. <br/><br/>* This decision was even mooted in the Budget announced by former CM Siddaramaiah in his budget . He even allotted Rs 50 crore for the creation of the common examination board.<br/><br/>* It might be recalled that when S Suresh Kumar took over as the minister for education, this proposal was placed on the table in one of his first meetings with the department officials. <br/><br/>* However, Suresh Kumar said, “This year we cannot do it as the PU board has already begun work. We will merge the examination board next year.”</i></p>
