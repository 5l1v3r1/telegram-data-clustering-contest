      <p>PHOENIX (AP) - Jeff Maggert shot a 6-under 65 on Friday to increase his lead to four strokes in the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/charles-schwab-corp/">Charles Schwab</a> Cup Championship, with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bernhard-langer/">Bernhard Langer</a> second in a bid for his record sixth PGA Tour Champions season points title.</p>
      <p>Maggert birdied three of the first four holes in a front-nine 31 and capped the bogey-free round with a birdie on the par-4 17th in perfect conditions at Phoenix Country Club. He had a 14-under 128 total.</p>
      <p>“A good start again. I hit the ball very well on the front nine,” Maggert said. “Not so much on the back nine, but had a lot of good par saves. Didn’t leave myself with a lot of pressure putts today. I made a nice 10-footer for par on, I think, No. 11. Other than that, my up-and-downs, I was chipping it pretty close. And got lucky on 17 and holed a bunker shot.”</p>
      <p>The 55-year-old Texan entered the season-ending event 31st in the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/charles-schwab-corp/">Charles Schwab</a> Cup standings, just three spots from failing to qualify. He won three times on the PGA Tour and has five senior victories, one in 2014 and four in 2015.</p>
      <p>“I haven’t played well this year and I wanted to finish the year off on a good note,” Maggert said. “But we’re only halfway done. I need to play a lot more good golf over the next two days. … Looking forward to just keeping the foot on the gas pedal and trying to make birdies over the weekend.”</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bernhard-langer/">Langer</a> closed with a double bogey after hitting into the water on the par-5 18th. Coming off a playoff loss to Colin Montgomerie on Sunday in California, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bernhard-langer/">Langer</a> is third in the standings behind Scott McCarron and Jerry Kelly.</p>
      <p>“I hit my bunker shot fat,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bernhard-langer/">Langer</a> said. “I was hoping to get a lot closer with the sand wedge. And I was caught between a 9-iron and a wedge, and used the 9-iron and pushed it.”</p>
      <p>To take the season title, the 62-year-old German star needs to win the event and have McCarron finish in a two-way tie for fifth or worse and Kelly finish in a two-way tie for second or worse. McCarron (71) and Kelly (74) were tied for 25th at 2 under.</p>
      <p>“I’m putting well, which is key,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bernhard-langer/">Langer</a> said. “I’m not quite totally happy with my ball-striking, but if I get my ball-striking sorted out, I feel I can really put a charge on, because my short game is good.”</p>

        <p>Retief Goosen, fifth in the standings, had his second straight 67 to join Brandt Jobe (66) and Marco Dawson (67) at 8 under.</p>
        <p>Miguel Angel Jimenez (70) was another stroke back with Joe Durant (66), Wes Short Jr. (67) and Steve Flesch (70).</p>
