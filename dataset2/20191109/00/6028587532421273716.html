      <p>The push to the college football playoffs and conference championships is in full stride in November. The biggest game of the season is Saturday in Tuscaloosa, and the betting action is as big as the hype for the SEC showdown between LSU and Alabama. The College Football Playoff Committee unveiled its first <a href="https://www.ncaa.com/rankings/football/fbs/college-football-playoff?utm_campaign=trending">rankings</a> of the season this week, and Ohio State is No. 1. Two SEC teams occupy the top four spots, along with two Big Ten teams. The Saturday showdown between No. 2 LSU and No. 3 Alabama will have a huge impact on the college football playoff chase.</p>
      <p>1. Ohio State (8-0)</p>
      <p>2. LSU (8-0)</p>
      <p>3. Alabama (8-0)</p>
      <p>4. Penn State (8-0) </p>
      <p>5. Clemson (9-0)</p>
      <p>6. Georgia (7-1)</p>
      <p>7. Oregon (8-1)</p>
      <p>8. Utah (8-1)</p>
      <p>9. Oklahoma (7-1)</p>
      <p>10. Florida (7-2)</p>
      <p>The three Top 25 match-ups on Saturday include three teams in the top-4 of the opening college football playoff rankings.</p>
      <p>No. 4 Penn State (-6.5) at No. 17 Minnesota - 12:00 ET on ABC</p>
      <p>No. 2 LSU at No. 3 Alabama (-6) - 3:30 ET on CBS</p>
      <p>No. 18 Iowa at No. 13 Wisconsin (-9) - 4:00 ET on FOX</p>
      <p>On Thursday, 72% of bets and 58% money was on the LSU Tigers at FanDuel Sportsbooks. Currently, LSU is taking 56% of the spread bets and 79% of the moneyline bets from a consensus of seven leading online sportsbooks tracked by Sports Insights <a href="https://www.sportsinsights.com/ncaaf/">live odds and data</a>.</p>
      <p>At Betonline and <a href="https://www.sportsbetting.ag/">SportsBetting.ag</a>, head linesmaker Adam Burns said the LSU and Alabama game has already generated more bets than any college football game this season.</p>
      <p>“This is one of the best matchups we’ve had in years in terms of rankings and hype, and everybody wants a piece of the action,” Burns said. “There are so many different ways to gamble on this game, and the bettors are getting their fill.”</p>
      <p>Alabama has beaten LSU eight straight times. What’s noteworthy in this huge SEC showdown is that the over/under of 62.5 points is the highest total ever in the history of this SEC rivalry with the previous high 54 posted in 2013. The total has been bet down from the opener of 66 points, as both teams are <a href="https://osga.com/online_gaming_articles.php?College-Football-Defensive-Dominators-24626"><b>defensive dominators</b></a>, who allow 4.4 and 4.5 yards per play respectively. However, both teams are explosive on offense and especially through the air with the two leading <a href="https://www.thelines.com/odds/heisman/">Heisman Trophy</a> candidates at quarterback leading LSU and Alabama.</p>
      <p>Alabama is out-gaining opponents by 221 yards per game while LSU has played a tougher schedule and out-gained opponents by 199 yards per game.</p>
      <p>College Game Day is in Tuscaloosa along with many pro scouts to watch the terrific talent on both teams including quarterbacks Joe Burrow and Tua Tagovailoa. Alabama’s quarterback will play, but Tua (ankle) was noticeably <a href="https://www.al.com/alabamafootball/2019/11/gary-danielson-doesnt-care-what-anybody-says-tua-tagovailoa-not-as-nimble-no-spring-in-step.html">not as nimble</a> at Friday’s practice and “he isn’t 100 percent” according to CBS game analyst Gary Danielson. Tagovailoa is recovering from ankle surgery and has been in a quick rehab trying to get ready for the biggest game of the season thus far.</p>
      <p>Both LSU and Alabama are off a bye week in preparation for this most anticipated match-up. The defenses will be tasked with trying to slow two elite quarterbacks and offenses that each average more than 500 yards per game and over 330 passing yards per game.</p>
      <p>Alabama - 510 yards total offense with 168 rushing and 338 passing.</p>
      <p>LSU - 525 yards total offense with 163 rushing and 361 passing</p>
      <p>Pro Football Focus provides some added insight into the match-up and LSU’s secondary’s task of slowing down Alabama’s nation-best receiving core.</p>
      <p>Alabama is +13 in turnover margin this season, and teams that fall behind the Crimson Tide are often overmatched and unable to come back. But LSU has shown they can move the ball against all opponents, including two better SEC defenses. The Tigers racked up more than 500 yards offense against Florida and Auburn at home in the past month in victories while also running the ball effectively.</p>
      <p>Louisiana State has not allowed a team to rush for more than 150 yards this season, and Alabama’s ground game has only rushed for more than 180 yards in one game, and that was against the softest team on their schedule New Mexico State.</p>
      <h3>When is the 2019 College Football Playoff semifinals?</h3>
      <p>The CFP semifinals are set for Dec. 28, 2019. One semifinal is the Peach Bowl from Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. The other semifinal is the Fiesta Bowl in Glendale, Arizona.</p>
      <h3>When is the 2020 College Football Playoff national championship?</h3>
      <p>The CFP national championship is a bit later in 2020. The two winners of the semifinals will meet on the second Monday of January in New Orleans on Jan. 13, 2020 at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome.</p>
      <p>Betting against Alabama is tough, and especially with an extra week to prepare for coach Saban and his staff. The Crimson Tide are 31-1 SU in SEC play since the start of the 2016 including 5-0 this year. But as a single-digit favorite, Alabama is just 3-10 ATS in SEC games.</p>
      <p>The betting action on LSU and Alabama will continue at a fast pace like the Tigers and Tide offenses. Plenty of cheering and betting for both teams, but not for President Trump, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackjones/2019/11/06/trump-to-attend-lsu-alabama-game-odds--presidential-props-hit-the-board/#30737bba2ac6">who will attend </a>the SEC showdown in Tuscaloosa.</p>
      <p>You can bet on it.</p>
