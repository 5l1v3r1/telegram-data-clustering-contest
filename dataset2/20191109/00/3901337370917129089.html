        <b>English Premier League</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Result:</b> Norwich City 0-2 Watford</p>
      <p><b>Date:</b> 08 November 2019</p>
      <p><b>Venue:</b> Carrow Road</p>
      <p>Watford collected their first Premier League victory this season victory following a 2-0 triumph over Norwich City at Carrow Road on Friday.</p>
      <p>The league’s winless side showed face with three changes from the loss to Chelsea in Jose Holebas, Etienne Capoue and Will Hughes.</p>
      <p>Watford wasted no time to go ahead when Gerard Deulofeu skipped a few challenges to find the bottom left corner of Tim Krul’s goal.</p>
      <p>The setback rattled the Canaries who battled to contain the threats of Roberto Pereyra, Daryl Janmaat and Deulofeu as the Hornets closed in on a second a little later.</p>
      <p>Norwich were out of the cave following the 20th minute as Alexander Tettey combined with Emi Buendia’s delivery before directing the effort wide of the far post.</p>
      <p>The half ended with the visitors on course to finally get their campaign off the mark, as the Canaries hanged in the balance of things.</p>
      <p>Andre Gray increased their cushion seven minutes after the halftime brea with a clever backheel inside the six-yard area following a cross into the area.</p>
      <p>Norwich pushed for a reply with an effort from Buendia, but the Argentine failed to profit before making way for Todd Cantwell on 62 minutes.</p>
      <p>The visitors were brought down to ten men three minutes later after Christian Kabasele received a second booking after lunging at substitute Josip Drmic.</p>
      <p>Watford failed to kill off the match ten minutes to the end as Gray blazed over the top after going face-to-face with Krul.</p>
      <p>The visitors nonetheless had done enough to pick up their first victory of the season after 12 matches, moving off the foot of the table too.</p>
