      <p>Popular Polish strongman <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Mariusz-Pudzianowski-57308">Mariusz Pudzianowski</a> halted a two-fight skid with a stoppage of social media star <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Erko-Jun-281331">Erko Jun</a> in the Konfrontacja Sztuk Walki 51 headliner in Zagreb, Croatia, on Saturday.<br/><br/>Both heavyweights began the fight looking for a finish on the feet in the opening stanza. Jun appeared to be in control in Round 2, as he landed ground-and-pound from top position until a standup was ordered due to the Bosnian fighter grabbing the cage. Pudzianowski (13-7) then got a takedown of his own and pounded out Jun (3-1) on the mat, earning a stoppage at the 1:43 of the second frame.</p>
