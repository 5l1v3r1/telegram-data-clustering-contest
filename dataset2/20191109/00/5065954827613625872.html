      <p>The Philippine Navy said that its second brand-new and missile-capable frigate was launched into the sea on Friday during a ceremony held at the shipyard of its contractor, Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI), in Bangeojinsunhwan-doro, Ulsan, South Korea.</p>
      <p>Navy Public Affairs Office chief Lt. Commander Ma. Christina Roxas said the launching of the vessel, BRP <i>Antonio Luna</i>, named after one of the country’s national heroes, completed the two-unit Frigate Acquisition Project of the Navy. </p>
      <p>The first ship, BRP <i>Jose Rizal</i>, was launched in May and is currently undergoing harbor trials, which is expected to be completed by the first quarter of 2020.</p>
      <p>Defense and military officials, including Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, Armed Forces Chief of Staff Gen. Noel Clement and Navy Flag Officer in Command Vice Adm. Robert Empedrad, witnessed the launching of the second frigate.</p>
      <p>The officials were also joined by former Navy chief retired Vice Adm. Ferdinand Golez, commander of Naval Sea Systems Command Rear Adm. Rommel Jason Galang, Naval Inspector General Commo. Sean Anthony Villa, Philippine Fleet Deputy Commander Commo. Wilfredo Burgonio Jr. and Offshore Combat Force Commander Capt. Karl Decapia.</p>
      <p>The Navy is expecting the delivery of BRP <i>Jose Rizal</i>, at the earliest, by April or May 2020, and the BRP <i>Antonio Luna</i>, by September or October 2020. </p>
      <p>Roxas said that both frigates are capable of engaging in the four dimensions of modern warfare: Anti-Air Warfare, Anti-Surface Warfare, Anti-Submarine Warfare and Electronic Warfare.</p>
      <p>Both ships are also fully equipped with surface-to-surface missiles, surface-to-air missile and torpedoes. </p>
      <p>The vessels’ primary gun is 76mm super rapid gun while the secondary gun is a 30mm gun. It also has chaffs and decoys as defense against incoming missile.</p>
      <p>“The acquisition of these missile frigates will strengthen the Navy’s capability to safeguard our maritime nation and territorial limits. This two missile capable frigates are tangible manifestations and benchmarks of the PN’s vision of becoming a strong and credible by 2020,” Roxas said. </p>
