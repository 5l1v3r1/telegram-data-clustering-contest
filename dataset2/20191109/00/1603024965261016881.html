      <p>The market ended with moderate gains during the week ended November 8 despite starting on a positive note, as profit booking on the day dragged the indices from their recent highs.</p>
      <p>On November 8, the Sensex touched a fresh all-time high of 40,749.33. On November 7, the Nifty closed above psychological 12,000 levels for the first time since June 4, 2019.</p>
      <p>Earnings from India Inc, the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) rejig and fresh measures announced by the government to revive interest in real estate and finance companies with exposure in real estate are among the things which fueled the rally.</p>

      <p>However, Moody's downgraded their India outlook to "negative" from "stable" citing that lower economic growth over the coming years has punctured the rally.</p>
      <p>On the global front, sentiment got a boost after news that the US and China agreed to proportionally roll back tariffs on each other’s goods in phases.</p>
      <p>MSCI announced a <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/msci-rejigs-indices-sbi-life-dlf-icici-pru-key-inclusions-bhel-yes-bank-excluded-4617951.html">semi-annual rebalancing</a> in its Global Standard Index (GSI) on November 7.
