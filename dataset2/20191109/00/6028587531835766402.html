      <p>The first time YouTube star Logan Paul stepped into a boxing ring vs. fellow internet phenom KSI, he couldn’t believe how simple it was. Through the first two rounds of their August 2018 fight in Manchester, England, Paul beat up KSI. It was so easy that Paul laughed and smiled throughout the early rounds and even stopped to showboat.He dropped his hands, daring KSI to hit him, and mocked his opponent by shimmying at him.</p>
      <p>After the second round was finished, Paul walked back to his corner and told his coaches that fighting KSI was easier than any of the sparring partners with whom he’d worked in the leadup to the sold-out event.</p>
      <p>“I was laughing because I couldn’t believe how much better at boxing I was than him,” Paul, who will meet KSI in a rematch on Saturday in Los Angeles on DAZN, told me this week. “I showboated a little bit because I wanted to take a second to relish at my superiority over him.”</p>
      <p>That extra confidence, that sense of joy, that thrill of sure victory—those smiles and laughs—soon disappeared, though. Paul got tired—the kind of exhausted where you can’t stand up and you have to rest your hands on top of your knees to catch some oxygen—and KSI took advantage. By the end of the fight, Paul was on the verge of getting knocked out because KSI was hitting him with punches and Paul could barely stand.</p>
      <p>The fight was ruled a draw—I scored it 57-57, as well—but it felt like Paul got lucky to survive. Now, much like his life on YouTube, Paul gets the chance to reinvent himself inside the boxing ring. This time, Paul and KSI, aka Olajide “JJ” Olatunji, will fight as professionals with no headgear and with 10-ounce gloves in a cruiserweight matchup.</p>
      <p>Despite his near loss 15 months ago, Paul is the -195 betting favorite and KSI is the +160 underdog.</p>
      <p>“Logan started the fight better and slightly faded toward the end (being his first boxing match),” Dave Mason, the sports book manager of <a href="https://www.betonline.ag/">Betonline.ag</a>, told me in an email in September. “However, he has a background in combat sport (wrestling) and is naturally the fitter athlete. Logan has had over a year to train for the second fight this time around, so [he’s] seen as slight [favorite].”</p>
      <p>Paul believes there’s a good reason for that. This time, Paul said, it’s all going to end differently.</p>
      <p>“I’m definitely feeling more composed,” he said. “We were much more strategic with this training camp. Last time, I was pretending to feel good. But I was drained. I was ready for a vacation right after the fight. I had worked my a** off for three months, but I had over-trained. It wasn’t healthy. This year, I’m healthy.”</p>
      <p>Both physically and probably emotionally as well.</p>
      <p>If you don’t know Paul, here’s a brief snapshot. He got famous on the now-defunct Vine social media app and then transitioned to YouTube. He and his brother, Jake Paul, moved from Ohio to Los Angeles and became stars. Logan Paul shot daily vlogs, showing his extravagant life and his wacky friends, and he has nearly 20 million subscribers on the platform (KSI has about 20.4 million).</p>
      <p>But at the end of 2017, he made a terrible mistake. While at the Aokigahara Forest in Japan, well known for being a place where people commit suicide, he recorded and uploaded a video that featured a dead body. The global outcry was immediate, and he cost himself millions of dollars in YouTube ad money and sponsorships.</p>
      <p>For a time, he was ostracized from the community.</p>
      <p>But after KSI knocked out a YouTuber named Joe Weller in front of about 8,000 fans in London in February 2018, he called out the Paul brothers. Logan Paul was the one to sign a deal to meet KSI in front of more than 20,000 fans in Manchester, England.</p>
      <p>Paul’s critics won’t let him forget about Japan despite nationally televised apologies and a PR campaign to show that he’s a changed man. But Paul isn’t focused on that anymore. Now, he’s expanded his social media empire into gaming, podcasts, music videos, and mainstream acting. And boxing vs. KSI.</p>
      <p>Matchroom Boxing’s Eddie Hearn, who is promoting this event, is using this as an opportunity to convince the young fans of the YouTubers that they should fall in love with boxing. That could be helpful for two-division world titlist Billy Joe Saunders, the U.K. native who will make his American debut, and for a potential rising star like Devin Haney. It’s the reason they’re fighting on the undercard. That might seem like a stretch, but according to longtime Showtime commentator Steve Farhood, there’s some merit to that idea.</p>
      <p>“If there are going to be eyeballs that otherwise wouldn’t be there, there’s some positives to take from this,” Farhood told me this week. “If they’re getting paid more than they would have gotten without the YouTube fighters on the card, then there’s something to be taken from that as well. If their marketability goes up, they’re not going to say no.”</p>
      <p>Most of the focus, though, is on the internet stars. KSI said this week in an interview with <a href="https://www.boxingscene.com/ksi-i-definitely-fight-other-pro-boxers-beat-them--144066">Boxing Scene</a> that he might want to continue in the sport and that he could see himself actually beating professional fighters. Paul, meanwhile, is focusing on just one person to stop.</p>
      <p>“The first fight was weird. It was such an adrenaline drop after the second round. It was 100 mph to 0,” Paul said. “Now, I’m just about ready to peak. As my coach Shannon [Briggs] says, the cake is baked to perfection.”</p>
