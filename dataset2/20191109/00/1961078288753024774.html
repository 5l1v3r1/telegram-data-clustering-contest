      <h1>‘Gender Reveal’ Celebration in Texas Led to a Plane Crash</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T00:00:31+00:00">09 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Emily S. Rueb</a></address>
      <p>In recent years, expectant parents have gone to extreme lengths to create splashy, Instagrammable moments to announce the sex of their child. Some of the celebrations, however, have ended in calamity: a 45,000-acre forest fire, a flaming car, a deadly explosion.</p>
      <p>And now, a plane crash could be added to that list, according to a preliminary report from the National Transportation Safety Board filed this week.</p>
      <p>A crop-dusting plane that dumped hundreds of gallons of pink water over a field in Turkey, Texas, about 300 miles northwest of Dallas, crashed to the ground in early September, <a href="https://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/TOCPrint.cfm?docketID=62993&amp;sort=0&amp;order=1&amp;searchTitle=&amp;dorp=0">according to safety board documents</a>. No major injuries were reported.</p>
      <p>The pilot, Raj Horan, had been “conducting a gender reveal flight for a friend” when, after releasing about 350 gallons of water, the single-seat plane “got too slow” and stalled, records show.</p>
      <p>A passenger, identified as Jennifer Harrell, sustained minor injuries, according to the incident report. The aircraft, which struck the ground and flipped on its back, sustained substantial damage.</p>
      <p>Attempts to reach Ms. Harrell and Mr. Horan on Friday afternoon were not successful.</p>
      <p>The pilot told investigators there were “no preimpact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane.”</p>
      <p>Cultural researchers have traced the origins of the so-called gender reveal <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2019/11/01/us/ap-us-gender-reveal-explosions.html?module=inline">party to the late 2000s</a>. But those early attempts feel almost quaint by today’s standards.</p>
      <p>Despite the possibility of attracting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/25/magazine/should-i-go-to-a-gender-reveal-party.html?module=inline">backlash for reinforcing gender stereotypes</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/1LqOjDIJNZE">schadenfreude should things go wrong</a>, some couples have felt that confetti or cake sprinkles are not flashy enough to deliver their messages.</p>
      <p>Last month, an Iowa couple trying to create a device that could shoot colored powder into the air inadvertently built a pipe bomb that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/28/us/gender-reveal-party-death.html?module=inline">killed one of their guests</a>. A day later, authorities in the state investigated another explosion of a store-bought “gender reveal kit,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2019/11/01/us/ap-us-gender-reveal-explosions.html?module=inline">according to The Associated Press</a>.</p>
      <p>On Australia’s Gold Coast, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/world/2019/07/09/australia-gold-coast-brisbane-gender-reveal-burnout-accident-lon-orig.cnn">a black car was rigged</a> to spew thick clouds of blue smoke. But after drifting slowly and spinning its wheels on the road, the car burst into flames. (The driver managed to escape.)</p>
      <p>And in 2018, a man shot a rifle at a target containing a highly explosive chemical mixed with colorful powder packets that were intended to create a pink or blue cloud. The resulting explosion, however, sparked a massive fire that took firefighters a week to extinguish and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/01/us/gender-reveal-arizona-fire.html?module=inline">burned more than 45,000 acres</a> in Arizona.</p>
      <p>The man who shot the rifle, a Customs and Border Protection agent, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-az/pr/duty-border-patrol-agent-pleads-guilty-starting-2017-sawmill-fire-and-ordered-pay-more-8">pleaded guilty</a> to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/01/us/gender-reveal-arizona-fire.html?module=inline">misdemeanor violation of United States Forest Service regulations</a> and agreed to pay $220,000 in restitution.</p>
