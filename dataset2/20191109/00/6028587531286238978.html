      <p>On Monday morning one of nature’s rarest predictable events will take place when the tiny planet Mercury appears to cross the disc of the Sun. Occurring just 13 or 14 times per century, Mercury last transited the Sun in 2016, but it won't happen again until November 2032. In fact, it won’t be visible from North America for 30 years until a similar event in May 2049.</p>
      <p>So what's the best way to see and enjoy this special celestial event that, like a solar eclipse, is observable during the day. </p>
      <p>First, here are a few things you should know about Monday’s Transit of Mercury: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>It starts at 12.35 p.m. UTC and GMT, 7:35 a.m. ET, and will be already underway at sunrise on the west coast of the North America. <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/transit/2019-november-11">Find out the local times for where you are</a>. </li>
        <li>It will take 5.5 hours to cross the sun.</li>
        <li>It needs magnification. It’s too small to realistically see without the help of a properly set-up and safe telescope or binoculars.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>On that last point, observing the Transit of Mercury comes with this warning: looking at the Sun directly or through a telescope or binoculars without proper protection can lead to serious and permanent vision damage. Do not look directly at the Sun without a solar filter. </p>
      <p>That’s why—unless you know what you’re doing—it’s always best to visit an organised event. </p>
      <p>Here are your options for Monday: </p>

      <h3>1. Find a Transit of Mercury viewing event</h3>
      <p>If you want to see and experience the event with your own eyes—and meet others who have a similar interest in nature—a public viewing event with large telescopes is the best choice. In the U.S. there are <a href="https://nightsky.jpl.nasa.gov/event-list.cfm?dont_pass_lat_lon=false&amp;show_sunset=false&amp;sunset_lat=&amp;sunset_lon=&amp;EventBeforeDate=2019-11-11&amp;EventAfterDate=2019-11-11&amp;lat=&amp;lon=&amp;Mode=List&amp;eventafteryear=2019&amp;eventbeforeyear=2019&amp;eventafterday=11&amp;eventbeforeday=11&amp;eventaftermonth=11&amp;eventbeforemonth=11">lots of astronomy club events planned</a>, with <a href="https://informal.jpl.nasa.gov/museum/Visit">many museums also planning big observing events</a> for the public including <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/530888141074967">one at Caltech in Pasadena</a>, California. In the U.K <a href="https://gostargazing.co.uk/2019/10/12/where-and-when-to-see-the-transit-of-mercury-in-2019/">there are also dozens of public observing events</a> being planned.</p>
      <p>Only the last hour of the transit is visible from New Zealand just after sunrise on Tuesday, November 12, but that's not stopping <a href="https://otagomuseum.nz/blog/astronomers-gather-to-witness-a-sunrise-transit-of-mercury-in-mercury-bay/">Otago Museum</a> and both the Mercury Bay and Auckland Astronomical Societies hosting a very special "Mercury Rising" free public viewing event on Cooks Beach in the town of Whitianga in the aptly-named Mercury Bay in New Zealand. That's the exact spot Charles Green, an astronomer who arrived in New Zealand on Captain Cook’s first voyage, pointed a telescope skywards to observe a rare transit of Mercury almost exactly 250 years ago. The event starts the previous night at 8pm for an all-night star party culminating with a view of the transit through professional telescopes at sunrise.</p>
      <h3>2. How to stream the Transit of Mercury online</h3>
      <p>Observatories around the world will host events for members of the public, but they’ll also stream some spectacular views in real-time online (although NASA TV, rather oddly, appears to have no plans).</p>
      <p>Here are a few streams you can browse on Monday: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/royalmuseumsgreenwich/posts/2655277881189689">Royal Observatory Greenwich, UK on Facebook</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://youtu.be/GNvZHR91e4s">Timeanddate.com from Stavanger, Norway</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://livestream.com/GriffithObservatoryTV/MercuryTransit2019">Griffiths Observatory TV from Los Angeles</a>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. How to watch the Transit of Mercury through a telescope or binoculars</h3>
      <p>Amateur astronomers can watch using a solar telescope, or a safely set-up telescope or a pair of binoculars with solar filters. Since Mercury will be a black dot only 1/283 of the sun’s apparent diameter, you’ll need the magnification of a telescope (minimum of 50x) with a solar filter to view the transit.</p>
      <p>You can also get a view through binoculars, too, if you have solar filters, though they’re best mounted on a tripod.</p>
      <p>Another, safer option is to project an image of the Sun with Mercury transiting through a telescope or a pair of mounted binoculars, onto white card.</p>
      <p>NEVER use solar eclipse glasses in front of a telescope or binoculars to look at the sun.</p>

      <h3>4. How to watch the Transit of Mercury through solar eclipse glasses</h3>
      <p>So what about watching the Transit of Mercury through those solar eclipse glasses you have leftover from 2017’s “Great American Eclipse”? You can certainly try, but since the disk of Mercury is a mere 10 arc seconds across (slightly smaller than in 2016, when Earth was closer to Mercury), it’s going to be very tricky. As in, probably impossible.</p>

      <p>However, you decide to observe the Transit of Mercury—the last one until 2032—be sure to NEVER look at the sun directly without proper eye protection.</p>
