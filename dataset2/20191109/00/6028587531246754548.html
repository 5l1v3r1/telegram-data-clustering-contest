      <p>What does an NBA team’s record through nine games mean?Well, in the last 20 seasons, the best start the Portland Trail Blazers have had through nine games is 7-2, accomplished twice. One came in the delayed-by-lockout 2011-12 season that turned into one of the most tumultuous in franchise history, leading to coaching and general manager changes, and a major roster overhaul.</p>
      <p>The worst nine-game start in franchise history was in 1972-73, in the team’s third year, when the Blazers started 1-8. Since then, the team’s worst nine-game start is 3-6, accomplished four times.</p>
      <p>The fourth has come this season, with Portland falling to 3-6 with a <a href="https://stats.nba.com/game/0021900125/">119-115 defeat to Brooklyn</a> at the Moda Center on Friday. No team, of course, is out of anything after nine games (the 2002-03 Blazers won 50 games after starting 3-6), and Blazers coach Terry Stotts has long said 20 games is the time you can start drawing reasonable conclusions about a team.</p>
      <p>That may be true, but there have been some alarming trends for Portland in the start to what was a highly-anticipated season:</p>
      <p><b>Home woes:</b> The Blazers have traditionally been able to lean on a strong homecourt advantage, but the loss Friday dropped them to 0-3 at the Moda Center. In the franchise’s 50 seasons, it’s only the second time Portland played its first three home games without a win, the other coming in the team’s second season in 1971-72.</p>
      <p>There were, of course, circumstances in each loss. The season opener was against a very good Denver team; the Nov. 2 loss to Philadelphia came on a last-second 3-pointer, with starters Hassan Whiteside and Zach Collins out; and the loss to the Nets came after starting small forward Rodney Hood had to leave the game after playing 6 minutes.</p>
      <p>Still, those are the type of hurdles that teams overcome by leaning on homecourt.</p>
      <p><b>Assist me not:</b> One of the Blazers’ big early stories during the 2018-19 season was their focus on better ball movement and passing, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/miketokito/2018/09/26/trail-blazers-look-to-improve-from-historically-bad-season-for-assists/#3f27cfa95ea6">epitomized by assists</a>. In 2017-18, the Blazers finished last in the NBA in assists per game for just the second time in franchise story, averaging 19.5. Last year’s team improved by three assists per game, and ball movement became a major asset for the Blazers again.</p>
      <p>This season, however, has seen a major backslide. In the admittedly small sample size of nine games, the Blazers are averaging 17 assists per game, a shockingly low number for any team, and dead last in the NBA by 2.3 (through Friday’s games).</p>
      <p>The Blazers’ assists will surely rise. Otherwise if their season average remains at 17, it would set a franchise record for lowest average.</p>
      <p>The big headline Friday, aside from the loss, was the franchise-record 60-point game by Blazers star Damian Lillard. The effort was undoubtedly spectacular, but it was also a case of Lillard carrying the team by necessity. Lillard shot 19 for 33 from the field, 7 for 16 on 3-pointers and 15 for 15 at the free throw line. The other Blazers were 21 for 64 from the field (32.8 percent) and 4 for 14 on 3-pointers. A team does not get assists if players don’t make shots.</p>
      <p>The most telling number that showed how Lillard had to resort to hero ball to keep the Blazers in the game was this: of his 19 field goals, only one was assisted.</p>
      <p><b>The struggles of CJ McCollum: </b>After the 60-point effort, Lillard moved into second in the league in points per game at 33.3. In our fantasy-sports culture, this seems like a great thing, but the Blazers are really built to have Lillard and backcourt mate CJ McCollum share the scoring load, and right now McCollum is not doing his share.</p>
      <p>On Friday, McCollum shot 4 for 19 from the field and missed his two 3-point attempts to finish with eight points. It was the third game in a row he shot under 40 percent from the field and fifth time this season.</p>
      <p>For the season McCollum is shooting 38 percent from the field, including 39.8 percent on 2-point shots. McCollum’s game has always been predicated on being a masterful midrange shooter, but according to <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/mccolcj01/shooting/2020">basketballreference.com</a>, he is 20 for 74 on shots from 3 to 16 feet. Unlike Lillard, McCollum is not a player who gets himself to the free-throw line in high volume – McCollum is averaging 3.1 free throw attempts during his five seasons as a starter; Lillard is at 6.8 in that same stretch. That means midrange shots are vital for McCollum, and right now he is not hitting them at a high clip.</p>
      <p>McCollum had some <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/miketokito/2018/10/23/trail-blazers-first-look-bench-an-early-surprise-cj-mccollum-a-concern/#3daed0056ee9">shooting struggles</a> last season, but he had such clutch performances in the playoffs, he earned the benefit of the doubt. Historically, he has always been able to shake off poor shooting stretches.</p>
      <p>“Everybody goes through slumps,” Stotts said. “It’ll come back. As long as he doesn’t press too hard, lets the game come to him, he’ll be fine.”</p>
