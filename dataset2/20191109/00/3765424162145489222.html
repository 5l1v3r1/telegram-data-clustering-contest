      <p>A 34-year-old Harare man has appeared in court after swindling a local bank of ZWL$88 000.</p>
      <p>Irvine Kazamula of Ruwa was granted bail by a Harare magistrate this Friday and ordered to surrender his traveling documents and report to the police once a fortnight.</p>
      <p>The court heard that on different occasions, the accused who works as a Reconciliation Clerk at Steward Bank used his position at work to misrepresent facts by claiming that different subscribers had made failed transactions and deserved reimbursements.</p>
      <p>He would then allegedly transfer the funds from the bank to other accounts, hence prejudicing the bank of more than $88 000 which was never recovered.</p>
      <p>Kazamula will be back in court on the 11<sup>th</sup>Â of next month.</p>
