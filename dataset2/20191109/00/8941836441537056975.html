      <p>GRANTS PASS, Ore. (AP) - Conditions are dry in southern Oregon.</p>
      <p>The Grants Pass Daily Courier reports that with streams running at a trickle, fish biologists are worried about access for spawning salmon. Fire officials have asked the public to avoid outdoor burning until it rains.</p>
      <p>Ryan Battleson, biologist for the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife in Central Point, said small streams need more water to provide habitat for juvenile coho and steelhead.</p>
      <p>No rain is forecast for at least a week. October’s 0.61 inches of rain in Grants Pass, Oregon, was about 25% of average.</p>
      <p>The dry conditions have also slowed prescribed burning and slash pile burning at lower elevations.</p>
