      <p>'Jai Shree Ram', said Shiv Sena MLA Aaditya Thackeray, after the Supreme Court verdict on the Ram Janmabhoomi title suit.</p>
      <p>In a historic verdict on November 9, the apex court cleared the way for the construction of a Ram Temple at the disputed site at Ayodhya, while giving a 5-acre plot in Ayodhya to the Sunni Waqf Board for building a mosque.</p>
      <p>Soon after the verdict was out, reactions started pouring in from every section of the country.</p>

      <p>Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board's Zafaryab Jilani expressed dissatisfaction over the Supreme Court's verdict, saying it has a lot of contradictions and they will mull over filing a review petition. "Five acres are of no value for us. We are dissatisfied with the verdict. It has lot of contradictions. We will discuss legal recourse after reading the full judgment," said Jilani.</p>
      <p>Senior advocate C S Vaidyanathan, who was the lawyer of deity Ram Lalla in the title dispute, welcomed the judgment, saying it is a victory for the people. "It is a very balanced judgment and it is a victory for the people of India," he said.</p>
