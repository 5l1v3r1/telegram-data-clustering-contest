      <p>LOS ANGELES (AP) - A small brush fire broke out in the Hollywood Hills area of Los Angeles, sending plumes of smoke that could be seen for several miles.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/los-angeles-fire-department/">Los Angeles Fire Department</a> said firefighters on the air and on the ground had stopped the forward progress of the 25-acre blaze late Saturday afternoon.</p>
