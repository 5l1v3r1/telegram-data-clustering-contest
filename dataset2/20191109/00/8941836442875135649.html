      <p>CROWN POINT, Ind. (AP) - Indiana is adding more baby boxes that allow people to anonymously leave newborns in hospitals and firehouses, various officials said. Crown Point added one box last week at a firehouse after an anonymous donation, the Post-Tribune reported.</p>
      <p>Now there are six boxes in Northwest Indiana, including one at a Michigan City fire station and another at Franciscan Health.</p>
      <p>Baby boxes are padded, climate-controlled boxes where people can leave newborns safely and anonymously at hospitals or firehouse. The boxes cost between $10,000 and $15,000, hospital officials said.</p>
      <p>St. Catherine Hospital in East Chicago unveiled a baby box weeks ago. The hospital donated $10,000 to finish the installation, according to a release.</p>
      <p>Safe Haven Baby Boxes founder <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/monica-kelsey/">Monica Kelsey</a> said three babies have been saved in Northwest Indiana. “Don’t you think $15,000 is a small price to pay to save that child’s life?”</p>

      <p>Indiana’s Safe Haven Law allows people to leave newborns at any hospital emergency room, police or fire station without any questioning, risk of arrest or prosecution.</p>
      <p>One baby was found at a baby box installed at Franciscan Health Hammond. The other two babies were left at boxes in Michigan City.</p>
      <p>“These boxes are not the answer to abandonment,” said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/monica-kelsey/">Kelsey</a>, a former medic and firefighter.</p>
      <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the state has the highest infant mortality rate in the Midwest at 7.3%.</p>

        <p>Lake County’s mortality rate is even worse at 8.5%, according to the Indiana State Department of Health. The county’s mortality rate for black children is 16.5%. Recently, Lake Station officials announced a baby box is expected to be at the firehouse.</p>
        <p>Franciscan Health director of mission integration Sister Cheryl Dazey said via email through a hospital spokesman that her heart ached reading about babies being found in dumpsters and fields.</p>
        <p>“Our state has a Safe Haven Law for babies up to three days old, but many do not want to hand their baby over at a hospital, fire station or police station for fear of the recognition,” Dazey said. “The Safe Haven Baby Box gives them anonymity.”</p>
        <p>Dazey said with more funding they plan to add boxes at Franciscan Health Lafayette East and later in Rensselaer and Crawfordsville.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/monica-kelsey/">Kelsey</a> said the boxes have evolved over time. The first two babies surrendered still had their placenta attached, leading the organization to add a medical bassinet. “It was pretty apparent that we needed to do a little bit more.”</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/monica-kelsey/">Kelsey</a> noted that 60 infants have been left safely in boxes in Indiana, Ohio, and Arkansas so far. Their organization can get 5,000 calls in a 24-hour period.</p>
        <p>“The program is working,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/monica-kelsey/">Kelsey</a> said. “We should have been doing this a long time ago.”</p>
