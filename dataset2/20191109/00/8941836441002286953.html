        <b>ANALYSIS/OPINION:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Democrats are being sticklers for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/department-of-state/">State Department</a> impeachment witnesses preserving their internet messages, rekindling memories of the Hillary Clinton “BleachBit” saga at the same agency.</p>
      <p>Republicans have chortled at the other party’s insistence, given their defense of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/clinton/">Mrs. Clinton</a>’s mass email destruction in 2015-16.</p>
      <p>As Secretary of State, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/clinton/">Mrs. Clinton</a> adopted the unique practice of storing her official State.gov emails, mixed with personal messages, on an unsecured home computer server outside the government network.</p>
      <p>“I would have said, ‘You know what? I don’t want an official classified email system. I want to have my own private server,” said Democrat Bill Richardson, who defended her in 2015. “Because of WikiLeaks, because of hacking, because of leaks.”</p>
      <p>In 2015, she instructed aides to have a tech specialist delete older emails. He used software called BleachBit. Later, as congressional investigators issued her a preservation order, the tech support employee wiped away more than 30,000 additional messages.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/clinton/">Mrs. Clinton</a> ultimately delivered 30,490 emails to State, scores of which contained classified information. Former FBI Director James Comely called her email handling “extremely careless.”</p>
      <p>Today, Democrats are moving to impeach President Trump, relying often on testimony from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/department-of-state/">State Department</a> diplomats who use the same State.gov address.</p>
      <p>When Gordon Sondland testified on Oct. 17, Democratic investigative counsel Daniel Noble grilled him on whether he has adhered with the Federal Records Act on preserving documents.</p>
      <p>“So you say you used your personal or you had a dual cell phone for personal and business. Are you familiar with the Federal Records Act and its requirements for record keeping?” Mr. Noble asked, according to a transcript released Nov. 5.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>“Did that occur within 20 days days of the communication?” he pressed after Mr. Sondland said messages were transferred to State’s network.</p>
        <p>The line of question irked Rep. Mark Meadows, North Carolina Republican, who recalled the political battle in 2015 to find <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/clinton/">Mrs. Clinton</a>’s emails for the Benghazi probe.</p>
        <p>“I’m looking for 30,000 emails, Adam. 30,000,” Mr. Meadows said. “You want to talk about 20 days. Come on.”</p>
        <p>“Adam” is Rep. Adam Schiff, California Democrat and chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. He is leading the impeachment inquiry.</p>
        <p>“It is 9 hours and now we’re getting into this kind of crap, and that’s what it is,” Mr. Meadows said.</p>
        <p>Then, in a dig at <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/clinton/">Mrs. Clinton</a>, the congressman asked, “Did you have a personal server, Ambassador Sondland?”</p>
        <p>The hearings have produced an interesting tidbit on State tradecraft. Diplomats often rely on the popular WhatsApp to talk in Europe where the messaging software is popular.</p>
        <p>WhatsApp is rigged so messages migrate to State’s cloud storage.</p>
        <p>“We were told that we needed to and forgive me, you know, I don’t know all the technical terms but that we needed to kind of upload our texts to the cloud,” testified former Ukraine Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch. “And I got a special, I don’t know what the right word is, but it was somehow done for me.</p>
        <p>“So, you know, my belief is based on, you know, the conversations when this first came out, that we needed to retain our texts, I mean, I think that that was being done for me and my texts are somewhere safe.”</p>
        <p>Here is the Justice Department inspector general’s report language on what <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/clinton/">Mrs. Clinton</a> did:</p>
        <p> “In 2014, in response to a request from the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/department-of-state/">State Department</a> to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/clinton/">Clinton</a> for “copies of any Federal records in [her] possession, such as emails sent or received on a personal email account while serving as Secretary of State,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/clinton/">Clinton</a> produced to the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/department-of-state/">State Department</a> 30,490 emails from her private server that her attorneys determined were work-related. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/clinton/">Clinton</a> and her attorneys did not produce to the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/department-of-state/">State Department</a> approximately 31,830 emails because, they stated, they were personal in nature, and these emails subsequently were deleted from the laptop computers that the attorneys used to review them.”</p>
