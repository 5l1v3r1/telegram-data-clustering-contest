      <p>EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) - The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/edmonton-oilers/">Edmonton Oilers</a> didn’t need their top line in full force to beat the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-jersey-devils/">New Jersey Devils</a>.</p>
      <p>Alex Chiasson had a goal and an assist and Mikko Koskinen made 26 saves as the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/edmonton-oilers/">Oilers</a> snapped a two-game losing streak with a 4-0 victory over the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-jersey-devils/">Devils</a> on Friday night.</p>
      <p>Leon Draisaitl, Gaetan Haas and James Neal also scored for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/edmonton-oilers/">Oilers</a> (11-5-2), who improved to 6-2-1 at home. Draisaitl and Connor McDavid were held to a point apiece after having to carry much of the load for the bulk of the season thus far.</p>
      <p>“There were some guys who got on the board that were excited to do so,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/edmonton-oilers/">Oilers</a> head coach Dave Tippett said. “The other three lines really had an impact with their work in the game. That was a good part of it being a team win.”</p>
      <p>Chiasson was relieved to finally be a contributor, getting his first goal of the season after netting 22 for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/edmonton-oilers/">Oilers</a> last year.</p>

      <p>“Contributions from different guys,” he said. “I’ve said this time and time again: when you have guys on any given night coming in and pulling on the rope, that’s what is going to make this team dangerous.”</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-jersey-devils/">Devils</a> (4-7-4) have lost two straight.</p>
      <p>“It’s a hard league and especially on the road you have to find your game early,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-jersey-devils/">Devils</a> forward Taylor Hall said. “Any kind of let up and a couple of bad shifts and it ends up in the back of your net.</p>
      <p>“I thought we had some good sustained periods of time where we played well and probably maybe deserved a goal or two. But that can happen, especially on the road, especially against a team that are playing pretty dangerous right now and we didn’t seem to have an answer for that in the second period.”</p>

        <p>There was no scoring in the first period, with the best chance going to New Jersey. Taylor Hall rang a shot off the post behind Koskinen on a breakaway with nine minutes left in the first.</p>
        <p>Edmonton got on the board two minutes into the second period when Ryan Nugent-Hopkins sent Draisaitl in on a breakaway and he scored on a back-handed shot past <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-jersey-devils/">Devils</a> goalie Cory Schneider.</p>
        <p>With his 14th goal of the season, Draisaitl extended his points streak to eight games. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/edmonton-oilers/">Oilers</a> defenseman Joel Persson also picked up his first NHL point on the play.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/edmonton-oilers/">Oilers</a> added to their lead with four minutes left in the second. Haas tipped home a shot from the point by Matt Benning.</p>
        <p>Just 66 seconds later it was 3-0. Neal picked up the rebound off a shot by Persson in front and scored his 12th goal of the season.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/edmonton-oilers/">Oilers</a> got a power-play goal six minutes into the third period as Chiasson tipped a Nugent-Hopkins shot past Schneider.</p>
        <p>NOTES: It was the second and final game between the clubs this season, with Edmonton winning the first 4-3 in a shootout. … <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-jersey-devils/">Devils</a> defenseman Sami Vatanen left the game with a first-period injury and did not return. … The game featured five of the last 10 first-overall picks in the NHL in Connor McDavid, Jack Hughes, Nugent-Hopkins, Hall and Nico Hischier. … The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/edmonton-oilers/">Oilers</a> got a pair of forwards back from injury in Riley Sheahan and Josh Archibald. … Jesper Bratt returned from an upper-body injury for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-jersey-devils/">Devils</a>.</p>
