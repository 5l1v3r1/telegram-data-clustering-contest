      <p>WWE brought out all the stops for the 2019 draft, which was supposed to make it clear that there’s a new sheriff in town and that its name is <i>Friday Night SmackDown</i>.But that didn’t really happen, did it?</p>
      <p>During the first traditional draft since 2016, WWE overloaded SmackDown with many of the biggest names in the company, including Brock Lesnar, Roman Reigns, Daniel Bryan, The New Day and Braun Strowman. The way the draft panned out initially seemed to be WWE’s attempt at fairly evenly splitting the rosters while also ensuring that SmackDown replaces Raw as the company’s No. 1 brand. Truth be told, WWE let it be known that SmackDown would leapfrog Raw starting way back in June 2018, when a statement on <a href="https://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/article/smackdown-live-fox-october-2019">WWE.com</a> regarding SmackDown’s TV deal with FOX referred to SmackDown as “WWE’s flagship program.” That statement turned quite a few heads because for the previous 25 years <i>Monday Night Raw </i>was obviously WWE’s A-show in terms of its viewership and the way it was portrayed and presented, even though SmackDown has often had long stretches of producing better programming.</p>
      <p>It seemed virtually inevitable that SmackDown would become WWE’s top priority when it moved to FOX, which is available in significantly more homes and is generally considered to be a bigger network than USA Network, the blue brand’s previous home. Although expectations are high for both Raw and SmackDown <a href="https://corporate.wwe.com/news/company-news/2018/06-26-2018b">due to the massive TV deals WWE signed</a> for both brands last year, the reality is that SmackDown on FOX is a much bigger unknown than Raw on USA Network, which has been the home of Raw for the majority of its existence and has also hosted a slew of other WWE-related programs, including SmackDown itself, NXT, <i>Tough Enough</i> and <i>Miz and Mrs</i>. WWE fans have grown accustomed to seeing WWE programming on USA Network, which is one of many reasons why <a href="https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2019/08/new-wwe-nxt-usa-network-deal-worth-closer-to-100-million-658710/">NXT received a lucrative deal to air on the channel</a>. SmackDown on FOX–even though it’s been heavily promoted by the network–isn’t a sure thing and <a href="https://www.ringsidenews.com/2019/02/05/fox-will-cancel-wwe-smackdown-live-if-ratings-dont-improve/">could even be cancelled</a> if it doesn’t live up to the lofty expectations many TV executives and fans have of the blue brand.</p>
      <p>So, what does WWE do? Well, it decides to move a boatload of household names–ranging from Bray Wyatt to The Miz–over to SmackDown in the 2019 draft in a series of moves that would seemingly ensure that Raw has been replaced as WWE’s No. 1 brand. But especially after Raw landed both Becky Lynch and Charlotte Flair–who had been heavily promoted during SmackDown’s pre-FOX debut advertising campaign–and then immediately got Lesnar back after he was initially drafted to SmackDown, SmackDown isn’t WWE’s new top dog, after all.</p>
      <p>Of course, WWE was never going to simply throw in the towel on Raw, which must maintain its viewing audience–<a href="https://corporate.wwe.com/~/media/Files/W/WWE/documents/q2-2019-earnings-website-presentation.pdf">no matter how small it might be</a>– but the red brand should still be considered WWE’s A-show given the top talent it acquired in the draft as well. The biggest superstars to land on the red brand during the draft include Flair, Lynch, Seth Rollins, Kevin Owens and Rey Mysterio, who are no slouches themselves and should prove to be more than capable of carrying Raw into its new era.</p>
      <p>All you have to do is look at the big moves made by SmackDown to see that the days of WWE clearly favoring the red brand are a thing of the past but that just because SmackDown landed big names like Reigns and Strowman, that doesn’t necessarily make it WWE’s new top show. In fact, given the blue brand’s <a href="https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2019/10/wwe-smackdown-viewership-down-from-last-week-660945/">viewership struggles</a> on SmackDown thus far as well as its disappointing overall programming (aside from the previously unplanned NXT invasion during last week’s episode), it’s become obvious that SmackDown isn’t living up to the lofty expectations fans had of it initially upon its move to FOX.</p>
      <p>Previous drafts and “Superstar Shakeups” that had appeared to stack one brand with significantly more talent ultimately still resulted in the supposedly “more stacked” show failing to produce better programming than the less star-studded roster.</p>
      <p>That may ultimately be the case here, but as of now, what is clear is that WWE’s expected attempt to establish SmackDown as the No. 1 brand by giving the show a strong core of performers isn’t going quite as most would have thought. Indeed, the blue brand landed a slew of names who should be pivotal pieces to the show for the foreseeable future, assuming WWE continues to highlight those names and book them well going forward. The core of Reigns, Bryan, Wyatt and Strowman is nothing to sneeze at and consists of other names who had previously been relied upon to carry Raw, including Alexa Bliss and Sasha Banks. Now, the question is: With a world of pressure on their shoulders, will those stars truly be able to carry SmackDown and make it the real top show in WWE?</p>
      <p>WWE is hoping the answer to that question is yes, but early indications are that Raw–despite all its troubles–is still at the top of the food chain while SmackDown–even on its new home–won’t surpass it just yet.</p>
