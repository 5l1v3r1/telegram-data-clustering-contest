      <h1>Encroachers around Bellandur lake will be rehabilitated in apartments in Marathahalli but there’s a peculiar problem — their goats</h1>

      <p>After a committee appointed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to monitor the rejuvenation of Bellandur and Varthur Lakes submitted a report to the NGT that the authorities had failed to clear the encroachment in the periphery of Bellandur Lake, there’s some action on this front. <br/><br/>However, what’s standing between clearing the encroachment and rejuvenating the lakes are a tribe of goats. Seriously, we’re not kidding. <br/><br/>While the Karnataka Slum Development Board (KSDB) had built 200 one-bedroom flats to move the slum-dwellers from the lake bed, some of them are refusing to move as they have nowhere to keep the goats in the new houses. The KSDB hasn’t provided room for goats and livestock and this could well be a case study in slum rehabilitation. <br/><br/>On Friday, the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) began clearing the last and long-pending encroachments on the periphery of the Bellandur Lake. Around 100 policemen from KR Puram, HAL and Marathahalli Police Stations and one battalion of Karnataka State Reserve Police (KSRP) were deployed to ensure that the slum-dwellers were shifted without any trouble.</p>
      <p>I earn my livelihood by rearing goats and I have around 30 of them. I don’t know what to do with these goats if the authorities want me to shift to Marathahalli.</p>
      <p>– Selvam G, a resident of the slum around Bellandur lake<br/><br/>The BDA authorities began the demolition work at Dr B R Ambedkar Colony but had to stop when some of the residents did not agree to shift to the new flats in Marathahalli. There are 220 families residing at this slum for more than 20 years. The KSDB had constructed 220 1bhk (one bedroom, hall and kitchen) flats at Marathahalli and allocated the flats to 140 beneficiaries through a lottery system on November 5, 2018 but about 80 slum-dwellers had refused to accept the allocation of the flats. <br/><br/>While around 30 dwellers have already shifted to the new flats at Marathahalli, two residents are in a dilemma since they do not know how to shift to the new flats with their livestock. All these years, they were very happy and comfortable at this colony, which had space for kith, kin and kids.</p>

      <p>“I am totally confused. I earn my livelihood by rearing goats and I have around 30 of them. I don’t know what to do with these goats if the authorities want me to shift to Marathahalli. All these years, there was no difficulty to get fodder for the goats. Since yesterday there is no electricity and water supply in our new flats,’’ said Selvam G. <br/><br/>It was quite heart-wrenching to see Selvam and his wife struggling to keep the goats together. The goats were disturbed by the presence of security forces at the colony. <br/><br/>“I have six baby goats. The authorities want me to shift my house along with the livestock in a day or two. I don’t know what to do. I don’t have any other skills other than rearing goats,’’ he said. Suresh B, is another slum-dweller who earns his livelihood by rearing goats and cows.</p>

      <p>“I was born and brought up here. I laid the foundation for my house here at the Ambedkar colony. If I shift to my one bedroom flat in Marathahalli, I don’t know where to keep my eight goats and two cows. There is no place for livestock at the apartment complex in Marathahalli,’’ said Suresh B. <br/><br/>Surprisingly, no elected representatives, who till a few months ago, used to vie for the attention of the slum-dwellers, were seen at the spot. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, BDA executive engineer Mahadeva Gowda said that the clearing of the encroachments would be completed in two days. <br/><br/><br/>“We have allocated flats to those who refused to get flats through the lottery system. Some of them have refused to shift to Marathahalli stating that the new flats have no electricity and water supply. We told them that Bescom engineers have provided electricity to the newly constructed flats on Thursday evening. Water will be supplied through a borewell,’’ said KSDB assistant executive engineer Chandrappa V. <br/><br/>The Principal Bench of the NGT had directed the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike Commissioner, BDA Commissioner and other authorities concerned to appear before it with the compliance report during the next hearing scheduled for November 27. <br/><br/><br/>According to reliable sources, the BDA Commissioner, BBMP Commissioner and other authorities are scheduled to visit Bellandur Lake on Monday to take the stock of ongoing developmental works.</p>
