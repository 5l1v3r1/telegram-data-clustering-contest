UFC President Dana White has chimed in on Fury’s announcement, but doesn’t understand why the boxing star would want to make the transition, believing it wouldn’t end well for him.<br/><br/>Fury, 31, is undefeated in his boxing career (29-0-1) and recently made an appearance for the WWE, when he took on Braun Strowman at WWE Crown Jewel on Oct. 31. The popular British boxer clearly wants to broaden his horizons and believes a transition to MMA is his next stop, calling out the likes of UFC heavyweights <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Stipe-Miocic-39537">Stipe Miocic</a> and <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Francis-Ngannou-152341">Francis Ngannou</a>.<br/><br/>White, who comes from a boxing background, believes Fury would struggle to have what it takes to make it in MMA (via <a href="https://www.bjpenn.com/mma-news/ufc/tyson-fury-continues-to-tease-mma-move-dana-white-responds/">BJPenn.com</a>).<br/><br/>“Tyson Fury has worked hard his whole life to become one of the top-four fighters in the world in boxing,” White said. “He’s making good money and everything is going great for him. Why would you even want to come over here and attempt this? I don’t think it ends well for him.<br/><br/>“I’m getting into boxing now,” White added, plugging his new Zuffa Boxing venture. “Five years ago I’d have said ‘yeah, Tyson Fury, come on over here and let’s do this.’ But it doesn’t make sense for him, for his career in any other way.”</p>
