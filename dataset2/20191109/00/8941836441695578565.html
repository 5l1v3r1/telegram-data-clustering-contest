      <h1>Pakistan opens visa-free border crossing for India Sikhs</h1>

      <p>KARTARPUR, Pakistan (AP) - The prime ministers of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/india/">India</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pakistan/">Pakistan</a> inaugurated Saturday a visa-free border crossing for Sikh pilgrims from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/india/">India</a>, allowing thousands of pilgrims to easily visit a Sikh shrine just inside <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pakistan/">Pakistan</a> each day.</p>
      <p>Imran Khan and Narendra Modi held separate opening ceremonies on their respective sides of the new border crossing. It’s a rare sign of cooperation between the two nuclear-armed nations amid heightened tensions over the disputed Kashmir region, which both countries partially control but claim in its entirety.</p>
      <p>“This is the biggest and happiest day for the Sikh community … it will help with improving relations” between <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/india/">India</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pakistan/">Pakistan</a>, said Manmohan Singh, a former Indian prime minister. He was among the first group of 500 pilgrims to cross using the corridor.</p>
      <p>At the opening ceremony, Khan said: “This corridor is the beginning and things will move further toward the improvement in relations between <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pakistan/">Pakistan</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/india/">India</a> … Once the Kashmir issue is resolved it will bring peace to this subcontinent.”</p>
      <p>The shrine to Guru Nanak, the founder of the Sikh religion, is known as Gurdwara Darbar Sahib. It’s the second-holiest place in the Sikh faith and is located on the Ravi River just 4.5 kilometers from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pakistan/">Pakistan</a>’s border with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/india/">India</a>.</p>

      <p>The shrine is visible from the Indian side of the border, and Sikhs would often gather on bluffs to view the site from the Indian side.</p>
      <p>The new arrangement allows pilgrims to apply online for special permits to visit the shrine. Visas to travel between <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pakistan/">Pakistan</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/india/">India</a> are normally difficult to obtain.</p>
      <p>Over the past year, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pakistan/">Pakistan</a> constructed a huge complex around the shrine with facilities to accommodate 5,000 pilgrims daily, including a vast dining hall, a library and rooms for performing rituals.</p>
      <p>Pakistani authorities have called it the biggest Sikh shrine in the world. The religious group makes up only a tiny minority in Muslim-majority Pakistan.</p>

        <p>Many Sikh holy sites were left in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pakistan/">Pakistan</a> after the British partitioned the subcontinent into separate nations in 1947 following two centuries of colonial rule.</p>
