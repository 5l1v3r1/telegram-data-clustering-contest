      <h1>Vizio TVs Getting Great HDR Feature Update</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T00:00:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">John Archer</a></address>
      <p>Reports are emerging from numerous sources suggesting that Vizio is rolling out a firmware update to its TVs that introduces HDR10+ support.According to posts on Reddit and AVSForum by Vizio TV owners, new firmware update 4.0.20.30 started adding support for the latest dynamic HDR format to various Vizio TVs towards the end of last week.</p>
      <p>Vizio has yet to issue a formal press statement about the new firmware, but Vizio Support has issued a post on Reddit stating that the sets currently receiving HDR10+ are as follows: 2019 P-Series Quantum and P-Series Quantum X models, 2018 P-Series and P-Series Quantum models, and 55- and 65-inch 2019 M-Series Quantum models. Which basically means these exact model numbers: PX75-G, PX65-G, P759-G, P659-G, PQ65-F, P75-F, P65-F, P55-F, M658-G, M558-G, M657-G, and M557-G.</p>
      <p>This is great news for Vizio owners. It means, after all, that their TVs can now take advantage of the extra scene by scene picture data HDR10+ provides on top of the basic HDR10 stream. This extra information helps compatible TVs deliver more dynamic and accurate HDR pictures. </p>

      <p>The rival Dolby Vision HDR format that Vizio has supported for some time does much the same thing, of course. But since a growing number of sources are emerging where the only dynamic HDR format available is HDR10+, it’s great to see Vizio taking a format-neutral approach. </p>
      <p>All of Amazon Prime Video’s HDR shows are available in HDR10+, for instance, while only a handful are available in Dolby Vision. Various 4K Blu-rays, too, including <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnarcher/2019/04/22/alien-4k-blu-ray-review-perfect-organism/#141a4cd17a05">Alien</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnarcher/2019/02/09/bohemian-rhapsody-4k-blu-ray-review-a-star-is-reborn/#751ae6537a8e">Bohemian Rhapsody</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnarcher/2019/09/24/yesterday-4k-blu-ray-review-all-disc-troubles-seem-so-far-away/#262b4dcd2570">Yesterday</a> and Bad Times At The El Royale, also only carry HDR10+, not Dolby Vision.</p>
      <p>While Panasonic and Philips (Europe) also carry support for both HDR10+ and Dolby Vision on some of their 2019 TVs, Vizio becomes the first brand to offer support for both dynamic HDR formats in the US. Great news for any US AV fan who wants to feel sure that their TV will get the best from any HDR source they play.</p>
      <p>Vizio is also the first brand in the world to provide HDR10+ support on pre-2019 TVs. With this in mind it’s perhaps unlikely that lower-spec 2018 Vizio models than the P-Series and P-Series Quantum models will also get an HDR10+ update. Or that any pre-2018 models will be able to handle it.</p>
      <p>Vizio’s move, though, surely piles pressure on the likes of LG and Sony to follow its HDR lead, raising hopes that one day all TVs will just play all types of HDR. Watch this space...</p>
