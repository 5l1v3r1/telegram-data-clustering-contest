      <p>Glenn Ollero fired a career-best 64 to emerge as overall champion in the ’69 Hits Gold Golf Tournament recently at the Manila Golf and Country Club in Makati City.</p>
      <p>Ollero, 60, beat Gie Ejercito, Benny Fulgencio and Manny Gomez in the tournament organized by the Upsilon Sigma Phi batch 1969 as part of its 50th anniversary celebration.</p>
      <p>The festivity will culminate with a grand bash on Saturday at the Okada Hotel Manila with around 500 guests in attendance.</p>
      <p>“Actually, this is my first-ever championship. I really prepared for this tournament and played my best,” Ollero said. “This is my best performance in my career.”</p>
      <p>Ejercito carded a 68 to rule the Founders’ Cup while Fulgencio and Gomez registered identical 69s as runners-up of the tournament which used a modified double-barrel scoring system.</p>
      <p>Eugene Espantero tallied a 66 to clinch the President’s trophy, ahead of Deo Ignacio and Dennis Gelacio who carded a 67 and 69.</p>
      <p>Upsilon Sigma Phi Alumni Association President Martin Romualdez praised the organizers of the event, led by Willie Fernandez and Erdie Malveda, that also raised funds for the annual “Pumapalo Para sa Bayan” golf tournament set on December 2 at the Valley Golf and Country Club in Antipolo City.</p>
      <p>Romualdez said the proceeds of “Pumapalo” would be used to fund the organization’s other projects like construction of school buildings, playgrounds, anti-dengue drives, livelihood projects, tree-planting activities, feeding programs and medical missions.</p>
      <p>“We have a regular Upsilonian event, the ‘Pumapalo Para sa Bayan,’ that aims to foster fellowship and camaraderie,” said Romualdez, the Leyte lawmaker and majority floor leader who is also the president of Manila Golf and Country Club.</p>
