      <p>Union Home Minister Amit Shah, on November 9, welcomed Supreme Court of India (SC)’s <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/ayodhya-verdict-supreme-court-awards-land-to-hindu-side-muslims-to-get-alternative-plot-for-mosque-4622041.html">verdict in the Ayodhya land dispute case</a>.</p>
      <p>The nation’s top court ruled that disputed land will be given to the Centre. The Centre will form a trust within three months. The trust will monitor and manage construction of a temple.</p>
      <p>The Sunni Waqf Board will be given an alternate and suitable five acre land at a prominent location in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh.</p>

      <p>The judgement was delivered by a <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/ayodhya-verdict-here-are-the-5-supreme-court-judges-set-to-deliver-the-landmark-judgment-4621691.html">five-judge Constitutional Bench</a> comprising outgoing Chief Justice of India (CJI) Ranjan Gogoi and Justices SA Bobde (CJI elect), DY Chandrachud, Ashok Bhushan and S Abdul Nazeer.</p>
      <p>“I welcome the unanimous verdict delivered by the Supreme Court. I appeal to people of all communities and religions to accept this decision with ease and remain committed to our resolve of 'Ek Bharat-Shreshtha Bharat', full of peace and harmony,” Shah said in a tweet.</p>

      <p>In a series of tweets, Shah said that he was confident that the “landmark” judgement “will prove to be a milestone in itself” and that it will “further strengthen India's unity, integrity and great culture.”</p>
      <p>Shah, who is also the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) National President, also congratulated the Justices and India’s judicial system for providing a closure in the <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/ayodhya-verdict-timeline-of-the-ram-janmabhoomi-babri-masjid-land-dispute-case-4621621.html">case fought over decades</a>.</p>
      <p>“I am fully confident that this landmark judgement given by the Supreme Court will prove to be a milestone in itself. This decision will further strengthen India's unity, integrity and great culture,” he added.</p>
      <p>The matter before the apex court was an appeal against the verdict delivered by the Allahabad High Court in 2010. The High Court had, in the absence of a title, divided the 2.7 acre disputed land in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh equally between the three primary parties -- Ram Lalla Virajman, Nirmohi Akhara and Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board.</p>
      <p>The verdict, pronounced shortly after the Court convened at 10.30 am, came after all parties presented their arguments to the bench in a 40-day marathon daily hearing. The bench had <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/supreme-court-concludes-hearing-reserves-judgment-in-ayodhya-land-dispute-case-4540001.html">reserved</a> the judgement on October 16.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
