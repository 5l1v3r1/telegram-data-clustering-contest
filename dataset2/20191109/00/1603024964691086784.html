      <p>The Supreme Court of India will deliver its verdict in the Ayodhya title suit case on November 9 at 10.30 am.</p>
      <p>The matter before the apex court is an appeal against the verdict delivered by the Allahabad High Court in 2010.</p>
      <p>The High Court had, in the absence of a title, divided the 2.7 acre land at Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh equally between the three primary parties -- Bhagwan Ramlalla Virajman, Nirmohi Akhara and Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board.</p>

      </p>
      <p>In a 40-day marathon daily hearing on the matter, all parties had presented their arguments to a Supreme Court Constitutional Bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) Ranjan Gogoi and comprising Justices SA Bobde (CJI elect), DY Chandrachud, Ashok Bhushan and S Abdul Nazeer.</p>
      <p>As the matter is sensitive, adequate measures are being taken up by the Centre and the states to maintain law and order. Security has been beefed up in Ayodhya, as well as across Uttar Pradesh ahead of the top court’s ruling on the matter.</p>
      <p>Security has been stepped up in the Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR) and Mumbai, Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>In a series of tweets, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on November 8, appealed to the people that the priority should be to strengthen India's tradition of maintaining peace and harmony after the verdict is pronounced.</p>
