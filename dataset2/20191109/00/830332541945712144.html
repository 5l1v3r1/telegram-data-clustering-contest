      <p>MADISON, Wis. - A tumultuous week that put on full display the partisan agendas of Wisconsin Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and the Republican Legislature also revealed the limitations both face under divided government that more and more is resulting in gridlock.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.channel3000.com/news/politics/republicans-gavel-in-gavel-out-during-special-session-held-at-capitol/1140032018">Republicans started and ended</a> an Evers-called special session on guns within seconds, taking no action. Republicans fired an Evers Cabinet secretary as a scowling Evers watched from the floor of the Senate. And Democrats rebuffed three attempts to reverse Evers vetoes, the first override votes in nearly a decade.</p>

      <p>Former Republican state Sen. Dale Schultz says he is disappointed with the partisan fighting and gridlock because "I know we're better than this."</p>
      <p>And former Democratic lawmaker Tim Cullen says the gridlock is "bad for Wisconsin." He says there "are no outer boundaries beyond which partisanship doesn't go any more."</p>
