      <h1>From Homeless Teen To Hollywood Media Executive - This 23-Year Old Entrepreneur Has Only Just Begun</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T00:00:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">John Greathouse</a></address>
      <p>Growing up was tough for Wayne Ayers. While in sixth grade, his mom became ill and was unable to work. By high school, he was homeless, bouncing between friends’ couches. When he periodically wore out his welcome couch surfing, he’d flee his hometown of Bremerton, Washington, riding the ferry to Seattle, where he could sleep on the streets without fear of being seen by his peers. At eighteen, Wayne moved to Los Angeles, where, by age twenty, he secured a stable job with a bank. Many people with his tumultuous background would have welcomed the financial security of a bank job. Not Wayne. At twenty one, he left the bank and founded <a href="https://whereisthebuzz.com/">WhereistheBuzz</a> (WTB).</p>
      <p>According to Wayne, he created WTB, “…to provide a news platform for young black millennials to express themselves.” Since its founding in 2018, Wayne’s media company has established a strong <a href="https://www.instagram.com/whereisthebuzztv/">Instagram following</a>, while securing viral interviews with the likes of Sandra Bullock, Ben Affleck, Jesse Eisenberg and Angela Bassett.</p>

        <b>The King Of The Red Carpet Hustle</b>
      </p>
      <p>I recently caught up with Wayne to learn more about his inspiring story and to get an update on his startup adventure.</p>
      <p><b>John Greathouse: </b>Hey Wayne, thanks for taking the time to chat. During those tough times as a kid, I’m sure most of your energy went to fulfilling your immediate needs. However, did you have the luxury of dreaming about owning your own business?</p>
      <p><b>Wayne Ayers: </b>I always have, since I was little kid. I remember when my teachers in elementary school use to ask all the students, “What do you want to be when you grow up?” I always replied, “I want my own company and a skyscraper.”</p>
      <p>When I got to high school, our teachers would ask us, “What is your dream job?” Being from Washington, most people would say, “Amazon, Boeing, or Microsoft.” I always replied, “I want to be my own boss.”</p>
      <p>I always wanted to give people opportunities and to help them grow. I believe making the people around me better, is one of my best skills, but I’m also aware now that people will take your kindness for weakness. Anyway, I always wanted my own skyscraper, studio lot, and TV network.</p>
      <p><b>Greathouse:</b> You eventually landed a job in a bank, which must have felt pretty secure, after your challenging childhood. What drove you to sacrifice a stable job for the massive uncertainty that comes with starting a business?</p>
      <p><b>Ayers:</b> It was my confidence and ambition. I knew leaving the bank job, I was going to struggle. I would make anywhere from $1,200 to $1,600 every two weeks. It was fun the first couple months, because I could pay rent, save money, and still go out with my friends. At the end of the day though, it wasn’t my dream. So, I decided to quit.</p>
      <p>I’ve always valued legacy over money. I always wanted to do something impactful that could change the world. My idols are Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King, Frederick Douglass, Malcolm X, Marcus Garvey, and Benjamin Banneker. They were never one of richest people in the world, but they will always be remembered.</p>
      <p>I risked everything to really make my mark in society. I think sometimes we fear to make mistakes and to take risk. I always said to myself, “I would rather suffer chasing my dreams, than to suffer at a job that I absolutely hate.”      </p>
      <p><b>Greathouse:</b> Nice role models – you can’t go wrong following their collective principles. What was the biggest challenges you had to overcome when you moved to LA and started WTB?</p>
      <p><b>Ayers:</b> My biggest challenge after I quit my bank job was while I was starting WhereistheBuzz. The struggle was absolutely real. Some months I barely could afford rent. I didn’t know where my next meal was coming from. Some days I would think my electricity and power were going to be turned off. I had to list a couple things for sale to make sure I could afford to pay some of my bills.</p>
      <p>Starting WhereistheBuzz was challenging because I had to find a team, still create content for our supporters, had to fight to get a spot on a carpet... I had to handle all the finances and also had to get equipment. Plus, I was behind on my bills. </p>
      <p><b>Greathouse:</b> Yes, the startup struggle is real. How long did your financial instability last - what helped you turn the corner?</p>
      <p><b>Ayers: </b>The first few months were difficult. It was hard to get film junkets and press access on (the) red carpet when you’re a new media outlet. Fortunately, things started turning around when we booked our first movie premiere carpet with Netflix and we have continued to get better ever since. </p>
      <p><b>Greathouse:</b> What is your favorite interview - which one was the most difficult?</p>
      <p><b>Ayers:</b> <a href="https://whereisthebuzz.com/what-men-want-premiere-taraji-p-henson-and-erykah-badu-tell-us-what-a-woman-needs/">My favorite to interview was with Erykah Badu</a> because they were trying to rush her inside for the <i>What Men Want</i> screening and she said, “No, I gotta talk to him before I go inside.” She was also so sweet, real, and really fun.</p>
      <p>My worst interview of all time was with Paula Patton. I really have to apologize to her next time I see her. I was stuttering and everything. I was really nervous because it was one of my first interviews ever at a carpet. She was so sweet to me, even though I was struggling that night.</p>
      <p><b>Greathouse:</b> I know it’s hard to boil big ideas into sound bites, but let’s try… what are the three most valuable pieces of advice you can share with entrepreneurs who want to start a media company? </p>
      <p><b>Ayers:</b> Tell the truth, even though people get clicks and views on messiness and gossip stuff. Your core supporters will always respect you, and other people in the industry will always respect you, because you have morals.</p>
      <p>Introduce yourself to everyone in the room even though you don’t know them. Everybody on this planet is unique and important. It will take you a very long way. And lastly, be creative and try to be the best possible version of yourself. Don’t try to emulate other people. Just do what you like to do.</p>
      <p><b>Greathouse:</b> Wow, you nailed that – great advice. Are there specific challenges you face as a black-owned media publication?</p>
      <p><b>Ayers: </b>WhereistheBuzz was honestly started to give other people opportunities to shine. I used to work red carpets as videographer for my sister Kiki, when she was a journalist. I noticed at every carpet, Black and Latinx outlets would always be at the end of the carpet. Then they would group us for these thirty- second interviews. I’ve seen many black publications go viral over a thirty-second clip, including us, which shows we are impactful and we should be treated fairly as other outlets.<b> </b></p>
      <p><b>Greathouse:</b> This is 2019, what the heck? What’s it going to take to make things change? What have you, and other minority reporters, done to stop being pushed to the end of the red carpet?</p>
      <p><b>Ayers:</b> I think giving minorities more reporting opportunities would be a great start. A great deal of red carpets, film junkets awards shows, etc., do not have a lot of minority reporters or media outlets on them. Inclusion would be a good to starting initiative.</p>
      <p>We also have had to be more assertive about our position on the red carpet. When we first started getting offered carpets, we would take every opportunity we could get. Over time, we have built a decent following and due to that, we have been able to use that to get better positions on the carpet. When I am at a carpet and see other reporters getting pushed to the end of the carpet, I usually speak up for them. We must look out for each other. </p>
      <p><b>Greathouse:</b> Besides more and better access at red carpet events, how would you would like to see Black-owned media outlets evolve in the future?</p>
      <p><b>Ayers:</b> I would like to see us support each other more. I think we are all in competition with each other to fight for the last couple spots on a carpet or a press junket. I think we should start creating our own events and start inviting each other. I think it would be very powerful to see.</p>
      <p><b>Greathouse:</b> Sounds like turning the current culture of competition into something more positive and collaborative is in your future. What do you see for the future of WTB? In specific terms, how will you define success five years from now?</p>
      <p><b>Ayers:</b> WhereistheBuzz will expand. I would love to have WhereistheBuzz’s production company start creating our own movies and TV shows. I would like to create a management firm under it. I also want to get our own app so our supporters can go to one place for our content. It’s a privilege to have social media but all our social media pages and YouTube channels can be taken down tomorrow. So, I would like to create our own app so we won’t have to worry about that. We also want to keep providing opportunities for very talented and hard-working people.</p>
