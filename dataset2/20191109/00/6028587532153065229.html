      <p>California, the land of raging wildfires, rampant homeless, and ever-growing inequality, has been getting a lot of bad publicity lately. For conservatives, it is 'Exhibit A' for the failures of progressive policy-making. Lost in all this criticism is a remarkable achievement. The <a href="https://calmatters.org/health/2019/10/behind-californias-record-low-teen-birth-rate/">teen birth rate in California has hit an all-time low and the abortion rate has fallen sharply</a>. Abortion is a difficult moral issue with competing concerns over female reproductive autonomy and the sacredness of what many people believe are pre-natal human lives. But one thing virtually all people can agree on is that significantly lowering the abortion rate by lowering the rate of unwanted pregnancies, especially among teens, is a fantastic achievement. So it is big news that in liberal California the abortion rate has fallen at double the rate that it is fallen nation-wide.</p>
      <p>Many religious and culturally conservative voters believe that the best way to reduce abortions is to overturn Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision holding that the constitution's guarantee of "liberty" covers a woman's right to terminate a pregnancy. This belief led many voters, especially evangelicals, to vote for President Trump despite many things that he has said and done that would otherwise repulse them. Trump, despite a history of pro-choice statements, promised that he would appoint pro-life Justices to the Supreme Court.</p>
      <p>This belief in the importance of overturning Roe is misguided. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/07/18/upshot/roe-v-wade-abortion-maps-planned-parenthood.html">best research-based estimate</a> of the impact of overturning Roe is that it would reduce the abortion rate by about 13%. (And even that may overstate the amount of reduction because a black market for abortion-inducing pills would likely develop.) By contrast, the rate of abortion in California, which has perhaps the permissive abortion laws in the nation, has fallen by 16% in the past five years. As noted, that rate of decline is double the national average.</p>
      <p>California is a big, diverse state so it is difficult to attribute the decline in teen pregnancy and abortion rates to any one factor. It doesn't help that the Center for Disease Control’s funding for studying these questions has declined under the Trump Administration. Nevertheless, it must be noted that California has one of the most progressive systems of sex education in the country. It requires that comprehensive sex education is taught in grades 7 to 12 and schools can choose to offer sex education courses earlier than grade 7 if they wish to. Also, Sex education must include information about the effectiveness and safety of all FDA approved contraceptive methods, including emergency contraception. However, none of this is forced upon unwilling families; there are broad "opt-out" provisions for families that object to the material.</p>
      <p>California doesn't just teach kids about contraception, it also promotes access to it. California law allows anyone under 18 to seek birth control services or the morning-after pill even without parental authorization. The combination of teaching kids about birth control and providing access to it has had a powerful effect. According to CalMatters.org: "Female teenagers nationwide are using contraception more — 81% of those interviewed say they used birth control the first time they had sex, according to 2011-2015 data from the National Survey of Family Growth. The percentage has increased from just under 75 % since 2002."</p>
      <p>Also, more than half of boys report using condoms during sexual activity, which means that kids are being more protected against sexually transmitted diseases as well as unplanned pregnancies. In turn, the teen birth rates are falling in every California county, sometimes dramatically. Kern County, which has had one of the highest teen birth rates in the state has seen its teen birth rate decline by nearly fifty percent in just a decade. As noted, the vastness and diversity of California, along with limited funds for studying the issue, make it impossible to know for sure if California's progressive sex education and contraception access policies are the primary drivers of the drop in teen pregnancy and abortion. After all, the rate of abortion has fallen nationally, although not nearly as steeply as in California.</p>
      <p>One interesting comparison is between California and Texas. Texas has an "abstinence-only" approach to sex education while California law explicitly requires instruction on birth control. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/teen-births/teenbirths.htm">Texas' teen birth rate in 2017 was 27.6 per 1000, nearly double that of California</a>. Furthermore, compared to California, "Texan teens also reported more sexual partners, having sex earlier, and not using contraceptives or birth control when having sex."</p>
      <p>California's achievement is something to celebrate and to emulate. Abortion is a difficult moral issue that deeply divides this country. Americans are not likely to come to a consensus about it anytime soon. But Americans may be able to come together behind policies that sharply reduce unwanted pregnancies, especially among teens, while also reducing abortions (more effectively than overturning Roe v. Wade) and still protecting women's reproductive freedom.</p>
