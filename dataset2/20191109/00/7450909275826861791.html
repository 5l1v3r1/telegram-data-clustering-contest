      <p><i>Fight Facts is a breakdown of all the interesting information and cage curiosities on every card, with some puns, references and portmanteaus to keep things fun. These deep stat dives delve into the numbers, providing historical context and telling the stories behind those numbers.</i><br/><br/><b>* * *</b><br/><br/><b>TOTAL NUMBER OF INVICTA FIGHTS:</b> 356<br/><b>TOTAL NUMBER OF INVICTA EVENTS:</b> 40<br/><br/><a href="https://www.sherdog.com/organizations/Invicta-Fighting-Championships-4469">Invicta Fighting Championships</a> on Friday put on a show that set a dubious record. <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/events/Invicta-FC-38-Murata-vs-Ducote-80583">Invicta 38</a> became the first event in major MMA organizational history to have every fight end by judges’ decision, and it featured the longest streak of unanimous verdicts, as well as the second Invicta challenger to lose her shot at a championship on the scales.<br/><br/><b>KCKS VS. KCMO:</b> The last seven Invicta cards have been held at the Memorial Hall in Kansas City, Kansas. This ties the record for the longest such streak at a single venue, which was set between Invicta 18 and Invicta 24, when seven shows took place at the Scottish Rite Temple in Kansas City, Missouri.<br/><br/><b>COMPLETELY OUT OF THEIR HANDS:</b> Invicta 38 featured seven bouts, and all seven ended up in the hands of the judges. It is the first event in company history where every bout went to a decision.<br/><br/><b>NOT A GREAT FOOTNOTE:</b> No promotion in major MMA history had ever put on a card where every fight went the distance, until it occurred at Invicta 38.<br/><br/><b>ONE LONG NIGHT:</b> As every fight was decided by judges’ verdict, this event set the Invicta record for the most consecutive decisions in one night with seven.<br/><br/><b>DO YOU CONCUR, DOCTOR?:</b> The first six bouts were all scored as unanimous decisions for the victors. This is the longest such streak in promotional history, beating the previous five-fight streak that occurred at Invicta 7 in 2013.<br/><br/><b>WANNA GO FOR A RIDE?:</b> With a finish rate of zero, this card eclipsed the previous lowest of .111 at Invicta 9 in 2014, when only one fight of nine ended before the final bell.<br/><br/><b>A COMPLETE 180:</b> Only two bouts on the card posted betting odds, and they were for the co-main and main events. Both bouts closed with the favorites -- <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Vanessa-Porto-12311">Vanessa Porto</a> and <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Kanako-Murata-219081">Kanako Murata</a> -- at -180, and both women emerged victorious by decision.<br/><br/><b>DOUBLE PRIZES!:</b> As no fight ended inside the distance, two fights -- Porto-<a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Karina-Rodriguez-113957">Karina Rodriguez</a> and <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Lisa-Verzosa-202449">Lisa Verzosa</a>-<a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Kerri-Kenneson-193183">Kerri Kenneson</a> -- were awarded “Fight of the Night” honors. This was the third card in company history to feature multiple FOTNs, joining Invicta 12 and Invicta 16.<br/><br/><b>PORTO POWER:</b> After taking a decision over Rodriguez, Porto moved into a second-place tie with <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Miranda-Maverick-230031">Miranda Maverick</a> and <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Tonya-Evinger-18248">Tonya Evinger</a> for the most wins in Invicta history (seven). Only <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/DeAnna-Bennett-75456">DeAnna Bennett</a> holds more (eight).<br/><br/><b>THE ELEVENTH HOUR … OF FIGHTS:</b> Porto’s bout was her 11th contested inside the Invicta cage, putting her ahead of every fighter other than Bennett (13).<br/><br/><b>SHE LONGS TO BE JUDGED:</b> By winning a decision over Rodriguez, Porto now owns the second-most decision wins in company history, tying her with <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Jinh-Yu-Frey-85549">Jinh Yu Frey</a> (five). They trail Bennett, who holds six, but one such victory for Bennett was declared an exhibition bout as part of the Phoenix Rising Series 2 tournament.<br/><br/><b>THE SCALES ARE UNDEFEATED:</b> Rodriguez tipped the scales 1.1 pounds above the flyweight championship limit, thereby losing her title shot before stepping foot in the cage. She is not the first fighter to miss weight before an Invicta championship bout, joining former bantamweight challenger <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Pannie-Kianzad-99523">Pannie Kianzad</a> at Invicta 14.<br/><br/><b>YEARS OF ACADEMY TRAINING WASTED:</b> Since she missed weight, Rodriguez forfeited her part of the post-fight bonus. This made her the third fighter in company history to take part in a FOTN-winning battle after missing weight, along with <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Raquel-Pa'aluhi-55072">Raquel Pa'aluhi</a> and <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Kay-Hansen-270021">Kay Hansen</a>.<br/><br/><b>NEW NAME, NO PROBLEM:</b> Verzosa improved her unbeaten record to 5-0 after taking a unanimous verdict over Kerri. All five wins for “Battle Angel” have come on the scorecards.<br/><br/><b>NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN:</b> Coming into Invicta FC 38, two fighters (Rincon and <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Serena-DeJesus-185201">Serena DeJesus</a>) had never been defeated, four fighters had never lost on the scorecards and Kenneson had never lost consecutive bouts (four fights).<br/><br/><b>I’M YOUR NUMBER ONE FAN:</b> Donning an orange mask made famous by the legendary <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Kazushi-Sakuraba-84">Kazushi Sakuraba</a>, Murata also walked out to his theme music of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDbXTekxSI0">“Speed 2 (TK Remix)” by Tetsuya Komuro</a> and won an exciting decision. In her bout, she also performed high-risk, unorthodox moves, including a cartwheel to attempt to pass guard.<br/><br/><b>LANA …:</b> <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Maiju-Suotama-51326">Maiju Suotama</a> made her walk to the Invicta cage accompanied by “Danger Zone” by Kenny Loggins and suffered a decision loss to <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Shanna-Young-126277">Shanna Young</a>. Over in the <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/organizations/Ultimate-Fighting-Championship-2">Ultimate Fighting Championship</a>, competitors are undefeated when using Loggins as a walkout artist.</p>
