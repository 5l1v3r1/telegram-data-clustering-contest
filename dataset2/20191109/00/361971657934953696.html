      <h1>Beyoncé, Rihanna, Meek Mill, More Sign Petition to Prevent Rodney Reed’s Execution</h1>
      <h2>Pusha-T, Questlove, T.I., and others have spoken out in support of the 51-year-old death row inmate</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T00:14:27+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 00:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://pitchfork.com/staff/madison-bloom/" target="_blank">Madison Bloom</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/4910-beyonce/">Beyoncé</a>, <a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/5310-rihanna/">Rihanna</a>, <a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/30022-meek-mill/">Meek Mill</a>, <a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/3503-uestlove/">Questlove</a>, <a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/4400-ti/">T.I.</a>, <a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/2714-cass-mccombs/">Cass McCombs</a>, and several other artists have signed and shared a viral <a href="https://www.freerodneyreed.com/">petition</a> to prevent Texas inmate Rodney Reed’s execution.</p>
      <p>The 51-year-old Reed is scheduled for execution on November 20 for the 1996 murder of Stacey Stites in Bastrop, Texas. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/us/rodney-reed-death-row-texas.html">New information</a> that could potentially exonerate Reed, however, has arisen in the case. Reed, who is black, was also <a href="https://www.democracynow.org/2019/11/6/rodney_reed_calls_to_stop_execution">convicted</a> by an all-white jury <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/death-row-inmate-rodney-reed-whose-case-received-national-attention-speaks-out-72999493513">in 1998</a>. The petition aims to rescind Reed’s death warrant and ensure he is granted a new trial.</p>
      <p>In a statement posted on her website, Beyoncé wrote:</p>
      <blockquote>Dear [Texas] Gov. Greg Abbott,</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Please take a hard look at the substantial evidence in the Rodney Reed case that points to his innocence. Be honest. Be fair. Give him back his life.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Beyoncé</blockquote>
      <p>Other artists took to Twitter to share the petition as well as their support for Reed. “16 days left and he will be executed for a crime he didn’t commit” Meek Mill tweeted on November 4, sharing a link to the document. Rihanna also shared the petition, writing, “One Click!!! SIGN this petition if you don’t believe the Government should kill an innocent man!!! @GovAbbott.” Find their posts below.</p>
