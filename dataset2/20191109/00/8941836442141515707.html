      <p>WINTER HAVEN, Fla. (AP) - Authorities in central Florida say two Disney workers and a former assistant principal at a middle school were among 17 arrested in a child porn sting.</p>
      <p>In a news release , Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said Friday that the 17 men arrested range in age from 19 to 77.</p>
      <p>Authorities say 52-year-old Walt Disney World Resorts janitor Donald Durr of Davenport had images of child porn on an electronic tablet.</p>
      <p>Investigators say 40-year-old Brett Kinney of Lake Alfred told officers he had an addiction to child pornography and worked as a guest experience manager at Disney World.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Disney says Kinney is no longer employed by the company and Durr is on unpaid leave.</p>
