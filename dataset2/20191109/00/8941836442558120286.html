      <p>WALTERBORO, S.C. (AP) - A South Carolina sheriff has been arrested on a domestic violence charge.</p>
      <p>The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division says Colleton County Sheriff Robert Anderson Strickland Jr. was arrested Saturday for second-degree domestic violence for an alleged Thursday incident. SLED spokesman Tommy Crosby says Strickland was released from the county jail after posting a personal recognizance bond.</p>
      <p>An affidavit states that Strickland assaulted the victim by “punching her in the face, with a closed fist, more than once, which caused moderate bodily injury.” It also says Strickland took possession of the victim’s cell phones, “preventing her from reporting the incident or receiving emergency medical assistance.”</p>
      <p>Investigators say Strickland also allegedly damaged the vehicle the woman tried to flee in.</p>
