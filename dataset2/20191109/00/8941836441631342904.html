      <p>SOUTHAMPTON, England (AP) - Marco Silva won the battle of the under-pressure managers as Everton piled more misery on Ralph Hasenhuttl’s Southampton with a 2-1 victory at St Mary’s on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Richarlison volleyed a 75th-minute winner to end Everton’s eight-match run without a Premier League away triumph and earn Silva a much-needed boost.</p>
      <p>Southampton, which had gone eight home matches without a victory, scored through striker Danny Ings early in the second half.</p>
