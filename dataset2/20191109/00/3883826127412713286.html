        <b>A court in the US has refused to release a convict who argued that he had completed his life sentence when he briefly "died".</b>
      </p>
      <p>Benjamin Schreiber, 66, was sentenced to life without parole in Iowa for bludgeoning a man to death in 1996.</p>
      <p>He said his sentence ended when his heart stopped during a medical emergency four years ago, even though he was revived.</p>
      <p>But judges said Schreiber's bid - while original - was "unpersuasive".</p>
      <p>They said that he was "unlikely" to be dead, as he had signed his own legal documents in the case.</p>

      <p>In 2015, Schreiber developed septic poisoning as a result of kidney stones. He had to be resuscitated by doctors in hospital, but fully recovered and was returned to prison.</p>
      <p>In Schreiber's claim, filed last year, he said that he had been resuscitated against his will, and that his brief "death" meant that his life sentence had technically ended.</p>
      <p>The district court ruled against Schreiber - a decision his lawyer took to the state's court of appeal.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, the appeals court upheld the lower court's ruling. It added that his sentence would not end until a medical examiner formally declared him dead.</p>
