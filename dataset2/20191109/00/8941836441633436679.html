      <p>MIAMI (AP) - A Nevada man has been sentenced in South Florida to 120 days of home confinement and ordered to pay a $7,000 fine for trafficking an endangered <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/galapagos-islands/">Galapagos</a> tortoise.</p>
      <p>Court records show that 33-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alan-wheelock/">Alan Wheelock</a> was sentenced in Miami federal court Thursday after pleading guilty to violations of the Endangered Species Act.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors say a K-9 officer with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission alerted to a parcel at a Miami-area FedEx store in August 2018. The package being shipped to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alan-wheelock/">Wheelock</a> in Las Vegas contained a juvenile <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/galapagos-islands/">Galapagos</a> tortoise.</p>
      <p>Investigators say <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alan-wheelock/">Wheelock</a> found a licensed breeder online in central Florida who would only sell to out-of-state customers with the proper permits. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alan-wheelock/">Wheelock</a> paid a cousin who was living in Florida, Maurico Perez, to buy the reptile and then send it to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alan-wheelock/">Wheelock</a>.</p>

        <p>Perez had also been charged but died before his case could go to trial.</p>
