      <p>WAREHAM, Mass. (AP) - A 65-year-old Massachusetts man has been arrested in the stabbing death of a 33-year-old man.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/plymouth/">Plymouth</a> District Attorney Timothy Cruz’s office says <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/david-robbins/">David Robbins</a>, of Wareham, has been charged with murder and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon in the Wednesday death of Yves Roux Jr., also of Wareham.</p>
      <p>Police say the stabbing happened sometime before 5 a.m. along Main Street in Wareham. Officers found Roux bleeding near a vehicle that had sustained damage.</p>
      <p>He later died at a Boston hospital.</p>
      <p>It’s not immediately clear if the men knew each other or what might have prompted the stabbing.</p>
