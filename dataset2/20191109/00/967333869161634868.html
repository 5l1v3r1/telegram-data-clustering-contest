      <p>Despite being imprisoned during an ongoing corruption investigation, he was a favourite to win the 2018 presidential election, which saw <a href="https://sputniknews.com/military/201910301077183029-shock-reports-implicate-brazilian-president-bolsonaro-in-marielle-franco-killing/">the election of pro-US leader Jair Bolsonaro</a>.</p>
