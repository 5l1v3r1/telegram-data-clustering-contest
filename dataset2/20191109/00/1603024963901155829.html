      <p>"I am grateful to all the experts who worked on the report and also congratulate them for their efforts," he added.</p>
      <p>The ASI excavated the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid site at the direction of the Allahabad High Court in 2003.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court said the underlying structure below the disputed site in Ayodhya was not an Islamic structure, but the ASI has not established whether a temple was demolished to build a mosque.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
