        <h3><a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Grigory-Popov-131039">Grigory Popov</a> vs. <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Davey-Grant-30564">Davey Grant</a></h3>
        <h4>Round 1</h4>
        <p>Hot on the heels of the UFC's 500th event, we turn to Moscow for an early morning of fights. We begin this trek at the bantamweight division, where Russia's Popov (13-3, 0-1 UFC) searches for his first win inside the Octagon against Grant (10-4, 1-3 UFC). Our referee to kick off the card is Vyacheslav Kiselev. We touch gloves -- something we did not see very often at UFC 244 last week -- and we are now underway. Grant hops forward and throws a few low kicks, and Popov tries to return and whiffs. The Brit sneaks in a side kick, and then spins for a spinning back kick. Utilizing another couple stepping side kicks, one goes a little low so Kiselev pauses the action momentarily. We resume, and Grant changes his attack to swing heavily for one to the calves of the Russian. He lands another, and Popov takes it without issue. Grant scores one more of those side kicks to the torso, and he is very elusive dancing around the edge of the cage. As Grant comes in to kick again, Popov looks to counter, so suddenly Grant hits a takedown and gets his man down. As Popov scrambles, Grant stands up to drop down some heavy ground-and-pound, but Popov is able to get to his feet. The Brit very much wants this fight to take place on the canvas, so Popov lands a few sharp elbows but Grant drags him to the floor once more. From his back, Popov wings some power elbows, and as Grant tries to avoid damage, Popov spins out and briefly ends up on top. Grant breaks free and the two get back to their feet. Although Grant just barely misses with a spinning wheel kick, Popov gets out of the way in time as the two men trade body kicks to conclude the round.</p>
        <h4>Sherdog Scores</h4>
        <p>Jay Pettry scores the round: 10-9 Grant<br/>Ben Duffy scores the round: 10-9 Grant<br/>Mike Sloan scores the round: 10-9 Grant</p>
        <h4>Round 2</h4>
        <p>A tap of gloves begins the second frame, where Popov is now on the outside circling away trying to find his kicking range. As Popov jabs from the outside, Grant leaps in with a knee, and partially connects as Popov bounces off the cage wall. A solid leg kick from Popov is check, and Popov adjusts his stance as they trade kicks again. Once more, Grant catches Popov in the cup, and Popov protests that Grant needs to be more careful. We pause, Grant is warned, and we resume rather quickly. Popov, who seems to be irritated by the low blows, chases Grant down with kicks. As Popov commits to a body kick, Grant times a perfect right hand counter right on the button, and Popov practically ignores it. As they jockey for position, Popov gets Grant down, but Grant swings around and snags hold of Popov's back. Unable to land any strikes of merit, he does manage to briefly put all of his weight on Popov to pull the Russian down, and is low on Popov's back. Popov takes advantage of the position and sets up a kimura. Although he cannot secure the submission, he reverses position and switches to an armbar. Grant tries to hook his leg to hold on and break up the attempt, and he pushes off the fence and turns over to end up on top, free of danger. Standing up to rain down a long punch, Popov rolls with the position and gets on top -- albeit briefly. The round ends with Popov on his back trying to score some elbows.</p>
        <h4>Sherdog Scores</h4>
        <p>Jay Pettry scores the round: 10-9 Grant<br/>Ben Duffy scores the round: 10-9 Grant<br/>Mike Sloan scores the round: 10-9 Grant</p>
        <h4>Round 3</h4>
        <p>The two men embrace to start the last round, and after kicking at one another, it is now Popov that catches Grant in the cup. The kick is much more emphatic than the previous two by Grant, and Grant is in pain but shakes it off faster than he probably should. Popov is apologetic, and we start up again. Risking another low blow, Popov rips a high inside leg kick that bothers Grant. As the Brit shoots in for a takedown, the Tiger Muay Thai standout catches him with a knee on the way in. Grant presses forward, possibly dazed, and still manages to hit the attempt. Popov rolls out of it and pulls for a leg lock, and Grant grabs the cage multiple times to try to get out of position and his hand gets slapped away. Grant survives, and we are back on the feet for about three seconds before Grant dives in for a low double leg takedown. This time, Popov grabs the fence to try to get up, but Grant pulls the legs out as he eats elbows for his efforts. Popping back up, Popov stings Grant with a big right hook, and then a short left elbow. Grant has notably slowed, and Popov is trying to chase him down but the Brit gets out of the way of any significant offense. As Grant tries for a side kick like he landed well in the opening round, it has little power on it so Popov shrugs it off and presses forward. With mere seconds left, Popov flies at him with a kick, but the fight is now over.</p>
        <h4>Sherdog Scores</h4>
        <p>Jay Pettry scores the round: 10-9 Popov (29-28 Grant)<br/>Ben Duffy scores the round: 10-9 Popov (29-28 Grant)<br/>Mike Sloan scores the round: 10-9 Popov (29-28 Grant)</p>
        <h4>The Official Result</h4>
        <p>Davey Grant def. Grigory Popov via Split Decision (29-28, 28-29, 29-28)</p>

          <h3><a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Jessica-Rose-Clark-115991">Jessica-Rose Clark</a> vs. <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Pannie-Kianzad-99523">Pannie Kianzad</a></h3>
          <h4>Round 1</h4>
          <p>In a rematch of their 2015 Invicta FC battle, Clark (9-5, 1 NC; 2-1 UFC) is ready to run it back with Kianzad (11-5, 0-2 UFC) and get revenge. Refereeing this women's bantamweight affair is Rich Mitchell. Unsurprisingly, there is no touch of the gloves, as Clark immediately comes in to pressure Kianzad. The Swede tries to kick her to the body on the way in, but Clark pushes through and gets her against the cage wall. They separate after minimal activity, and it is Clark that finds success in her boxing in the form of several sneaky right hands that get Kianzad's attention. As Kianzad tries to kick low, Clark counters over the top and catches Kianzad once more. "Banzai" backs off, and looks to set up a left jab before hopping forward to fire a left hook that surprises Clark. The two women stand in front of one another and punch each other square in the face, and both women show some marking on their faces already just halfway through the opening round. Clark comes in and initiates the clinch, but Kianzad posts her elbow to keep position and pushes Clark away and nearly lands a head kick on the break. Clark tries to bully Kianzad by coming in, landing shots and then shoving her opponent, and catches Kianzad on the end of a right hook. Kianzad dances away and flicks out a jab, and then doubles up on it, forcing Clark to wipe her eye. The Swede scores a powerful one-two, and Clark takes it flush and we can see some swelling quickly developing under her left eye. Clark throws a low leg kick and Kianzad is ready to counter, so Clark throws up a knee to catch her off guard. Kianzad lands a final knee, and when the horn sounds, she raises her arms in the air to celebrate…but we have two rounds to go.</p>
          <h4>Sherdog Scores</h4>
          <p>Jay Pettry scores the round: 10-9 Kianzad<br/>Ben Duffy scores the round: 10-9 Kianzad<br/>Mike Sloan scores the round: 10-9 Kianzad</p>
          <h4>Round 2</h4>
          <p>The two women are more tentative to begin this second round, but then quickly engage and land on one another. Kianzad loads up on a right hand, and tags Clark on the jaw with a combination that makes Clark briefly grimace before clinching up. They separate and Kianzad tries to sink in a body kick, and in an exchange Kianzad is now showing some damage on her own eye. Clark barely lands with a spinning back elbow, but Kianzad gathers herself and keeps solid boxing fundamentals and combinations flowing. Clark steps in and lands a huge right hand that nearly sends Kianzad reeling, and then cracks her with another, and Kianzad's eye is now starting to leak. The two women back off, and Kianzad digs a straight left to the body, but Clark counters with a combination of her own. Clark whiffs with a high kick, but does get in a low kick. The two women exchange until the round concludes.</p>
          <h4>Sherdog Scores</h4>
          <p>Jay Pettry scores the round: 10-9 Kianzad<br/>Ben Duffy scores the round: 10-9 Kianzad<br/>Mike Sloan scores the round: 10-9 Kianzad</p>
          <h4>Round 3</h4>
          <p>Kianzad starts out this last stanza aggressively, landing right hands at will and occasionally searching for a shot to the body. A solid left hand lands on the midsection of the Aussie, and then she absorbs a one-two up top to follow suit. Kianzad pushes in for a clinch, and lifts up a quick knee while Clark tries to trip her opponent, but it is to no avail. The two women break apart, and Kianzad lands a left hook followed by two quick low kicks. Kianzad digs back to the body again before continuing the attack up top, and snaps a right hand on the swollen eye of her opponent. Clark attempts to kick and keep her range, but Kianzad is ready to counter, and in one such responding combination, bloodies the nose of "Jessy Jess." The Swede walks through a leg kick to land some punches, so Clark attempts another low kick and again Kianzad fires back. Clark catches her opponent at the end of a combination with a left hook, so not to be outdone, "Banzai" fires back with a sharp one-two. When we hear the 10-second clapper, Kianzad charges forward and lands a few punches that make Clark back away, and the fight has now ended.</p>
          <h4>Sherdog Scores</h4>
          <p>Jay Pettry scores the round: 10-9 Kianzad (30-27 Kianzad)<br/>Ben Duffy scores the round: 10-9 Kianzad (30-27 Kianzad)<br/>Mike Sloan scores the round: 10-9 Kianzad (30-27 Kianzad)</p>
          <h4>The Official Result</h4>
          <p>Pannie Kianzad def. Jessica-Rose Clark via Unanimous Decision (30-27, 30-27, 30-27)</p>

            <h4>Round 1</h4>
            <p>In the first of five bouts pitting a Russian against an American, Yakovlev (25-9-1, 3-4 UFC) tries to hand Roberts (8-1, 2-1 UFC) his second consecutive defeat in the lightweight division. Drawing the assignment is referee Leon Roberts. A touch of gloves opens the fight, and the two men stand directly in front of one another but are only faking and feinting. Roberts is the first to land a strike, landing a low kick, so Yakovlev replies two-fold. Roberts leans in for a long right hand, so Yakovlev again aims at that lead leg, leading Roberts to reply with one. Roberts throws a right hand, and Yakovlev raises his hand in the air as if to ask the teacher a question, but referee Roberts tells the Russian to fight on. Yakovlev claimed there was an eye poke, but we push on so Yakovlev backs away and lands a stern left hand. Roberts stalks him down with right hand after right hand, and Yakovlev shakes his head as if he is disappointed that he is getting punched in the face. The right continues to add up for Roberts, so the American switches it up with a powerful one-two that hurts Yakovlev and makes him clinch up. "The Thunder of the North" tries to lift up Roberts and take him down, but the long legs of Roberts allow him to keep his balance and stay upright when he lands. Roberts eventually shoves him away, and quickly throws a leg kick but Yakovlev checks it. Roberts fires a combination that he uses to clinch up and grab underhooks, but the round is over before he can capitalize on it.</p>

            <p>Jay Pettry scores the round: 10-9 Roberts<br/>Ben Duffy scores the round: 10-9 Roberts<br/>Mike Sloan scores the round: 10-9 Roberts</p>
            <h4>Round 2</h4>
            <p>The two men are hesitant to commit to anything of note as we begin the second round, but suddenly, Yakovlev pulls the legs out from his opponent and takes Roberts down. Landing in side control, Yakovlev quickly jumps to the other side but is warned for grabbing the shorts of his adversary. Roberts is trying to fight his way up, but Yakovlev postures up and rains down a couple heavy punches. Yakovlev slams down some more powerful punches and while doing so, looks to try to set up a brabo choke, but Roberts is wise to it and stands up. Yakovlev drags him back down, so Roberts throws his legs up in the air to search for a triangle choke. He transitions into an armbar, and he nearly catches Yakovlev, but the Russian survives and pushes out of the position and ends up on top. Using another submission attempt to force Yakovlev to mind his P's and Q's, Roberts is able to get back to his feet. As Yakovlev fakes for a takedown, he draws out an uppercut that barely misses. The round ends with neither man wanting to throw much.</p>

            <p>Jay Pettry scores the round: 10-9 Yakovlev<br/>Ben Duffy scores the round: 10-9 Yakovlev<br/>Mike Sloan scores the round: 10-9 Yakovlev</p>
            <h4>Round 3</h4>
            <p>One last touch of gloves checks in the final round, and Roberts starts out with a jab while Yakovlev shoots in for a takedown. Yakovlev keeps his neck out there a little too long, and Roberts nearly snatches up a guillotine choke, but Yakovlev scrambles and gets out of it. While avoiding the submission, Yakovlev falls to his back and Roberts immediately takes full mount, but is unable to use it effectively as Yakovlev springs to his feet while avoiding damage. Roberts leaps in for a right hook, but the Russian ducks it and clinches up, but cannot capitalize on the position as they separate. Roberts strings together a solid combination, and keeps his hands by his side as he strings more strikes together. Yakovlev does not like this, so he pursues a half-hearted takedown attempt that he bails on when Roberts stands strong. Yakovlev wades in and eats a right hand, but lands a few shots including a right hand to the body. Yakovlev then tries for a takedown, but Roberts shucks it off and lands a few powerful shots, so Yakovlev backs away only to rush in and get the takedown after all. Yakovlev tries to rain down some punches but Roberts avoids any significant damage as he pops back to his feet. The two men stand and trade heavy leather, and when Roberts connects, he backs off and counters. Yakovlev shoots in for a potentially desperate takedown, and in the process winds up on his back with Roberts in mount. The American tries to cinch up an arm-triangle choke, so Yakovlev turns around but gives up his back for a moment. With seconds to go, Roberts tries to sit up and land strikes, but most importantly, ends the fight in the mount position.</p>

              <h4>Round 1</h4>
              <p>Up next at welterweight, Nurmagomedov (15-2-1, 0-0 UFC) attempts to be the third of his family name to record a UFC win -- Khabib and Said the first two -- against a German searching for his own first win with the promotion in Zawada (16-5, 0-2 UFC). Referee Marc Goddard will oversee the action. There is no touch of gloves, as Zawada is ready to fight instead. He leads in with strikes, while Nurmagomedov is ready to counter with a left hand. Zawada digs to the body and throws a heavy leg kick, and already appears to have a shiner under his right eye. Nurmagomedov shoots in for a quick takedown while Zawada is advancing, and gets his man down instantly. The Russian works the body and head indiscriminately, while looking to advance his position. Zawada nearly reverses him, but Nurmagomedov stays strong and takes half guard while they trade short body punches. Nurmagomedov stays heavy but the German pushes off with a butterfly guard to get him back into his full guard position, and throws his legs up for a triangle attempt. Zawada quickly transitions into an armbar, and Nurmagomedov is in a bad, bad way. <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/videos/highlightreels/UFC-Moscow-Highlight-Video-David-Zawada-Makes-Abubakar-Nurmagomedov-Tap-14659">As Nurmagomedov tries to escape, Zawada pulls him down and locks up the triangle choke. Nurmagomedov taps out immediately, knowing there is no way to get out of this nasty submission.</a> This is a big upset, and "Sagat" has now earned his first win inside the Octagon.</p>

                <h4>Round 1</h4>
                <p>Moving right along, Roberson (8-2, 3-2 UFC) welcomes undefeated knockout artist Kopylov (8-0, 0-0 UFC) to the organization in a big way at middleweight. Serving as the referee for this bout will be Vyacheslav Kiselev. A touch of gloves in sporting fashion begins the fight, and Kopylov quickly opens with a few looping punches that fall short. Roberson responds with a few that are shy of the mark as well, so Kopylov aims for a kick instead. The American presses forward and lands a low kick, so Kopylov fires with a one-two up top that makes Roberson readjust his position. Trading jabs back and forth, Roberson looks to set up a big left hand, but Kopylov keeps moving and working the body to stay away from that prospective power punch. Roberson lands a few more heavy leg kicks, and then barely misses with one up high. Roberson stalks down Kopylov, and then flips up another head kick that glances off the shoulder of his opponent. Kopylov backs off and bounces off the cage a few times to find his place in the cage, and dodges some punches that fly from Roberson. Kopylov fires a head kick up that gets blocked, but follows with a quick short left that catches Roberson right on the jaw, much to the delight of the crowd -- they have not had much to cheer for so far. As Kopylov tries to dig to the body, Roberson wings a big left hand and a body kick. The Russian plants a one-two right on the jaw of his opponent, and backs away before the counters come in his direction. Kopylov just misses with a spinning back kick, so Roberson throws up a kick that almost appears to be an axe kick, leading to a clinch and the end of this razor-close round.</p>

                <h4>Round 2</h4>
                <p>Once more the two men touch gloves, and trade leather immediately. Both score effectively and wear it well, but it is Roberson that is advancing and pressing forward. A straight punch to the body leads to a response from Roberson in the form of a hard leg kick, and then another. Kopylov stings Roberson with a left hand, and the crowd chants for him, but Roberson scores a heavy leg kick that makes Kopylov's knee buckle slightly. One more lands and makes Kopylov duck away, so Roberson chases after him with a head kick and falls over in the process. Kopylov allows him to get up and they touch gloves, so Roberson goes to the inside of Kopylov's lead leg. Another low kick finds its home from Roberson, and by throwing another, Kopylov's movement seems slightly hampered. Kopylov sits down on a left straight, but it does not have the same pop on it after the American lands yet another hard leg kick. The continued leg kicks are bothering Kopylov, so Roberson smartly continues to pursue it. Roberson whips another leg kick and Kopylov does not check it but actually reaches for it, and grimaces as he absorbs it. "Baby K" then launches a head kick and Kopylov is barely able to block it in time, so Roberson then pursues that lead leg some more. The leg is turning into hamburger, as these leg kicks are hard and loud. Roberson turns his hips into a leg kick and Kopylov fully takes the brunt of it, causing him to limp off. Kopylov tries to fire back at him, but he cannot plant on that lead leg, so Roberson goes after it once more to end the round dramatically.</p>

                <h4>Round 3</h4>
                <p>Unsurprisingly, within five seconds of the last round, Roberson throws a low kick. Kopylov attempts to come back at him and catches Roberson coming in, but the Russian instead pursues a takedown that Roberson shucks off. Sensing he might be down on the scorecards, Kopylov turns up the pace and starts throwing big shots at Roberson, much to the delight of the home fans. Roberson stays largely out of harm's way, but shoots in for his own takedown, and cannot land it. The American backs away and digs to that lead leg again, forcing Kopylov to try to respond by throwing a looping hook that nearly makes him topple over. A striking exchange dings up the nose of Kopylov, who then absorbs an inside leg kick as Roberson jumps in and out. Kopylov stretches his left arm out and jabs his pointer finger directly into the eye of Roberson, and that is a nasty poke as Roberson falls over. That eye starts bleeding, and the doctor is taking a hard look at it. Roberson is calling for the fight to continue, and there is a lot of blood coming from a cut on the eyelid. Kiselev takes a point from Kopylov, but the action resumes. Now confident he is behind in the fight, Kopylov throws everything he has at Roberson by winging combinations with wild kicks and punches. Roberson eats some strikes but aims directly at that lead leg with a few more kicks, causing Kopylov to retreat. Roberson chases him down and clinches up, muscling the Russian to the ground. <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/videos/highlightreels/UFC-Moscow-Highlight-Video-Karl-Roberson-Chokes-Out-Roman-Kopylov-14661">Roberson takes his opponent's back, and immediately seeks out a rear-naked choke. He grabs hold of the neck and will not let go, wrenching it with all his might until the Russian taps out.</a> Roberson becomes the first man to defeat Kopylov, and does so in style in front of a crowd that sits in stunned silence. Russian fighters are now 0-4 tonight against their foreign adversaries.</p>

                  <h4>Round 1</h4>
                  <p>In the only all-Russia matchup of the day, Dagestan native Khabilov (23-4, 9-3 UFC) squares off against Khandozhko (26-5-1, 1-0 UFC) at welterweight. At the very least, a Russian fighter will finally record a win today. In charge of the cage is referee Rich Mitchell. Touching gloves, the two Russians come together but keep their range until Khabilov throws a low kick. Khandozhko responds with one of his own, and perhaps the two men watched the footage of the previous fight for ideas. Khabilov leaps in with a punch, so Khandozhko replies with another two low kicks. Khabilov comes in with an uppercut, and the two men go punch-for-punch with one another until they decided to trade leg kicks. On one such leg kick from Khandozhko, Khabilov rushes in and takes his opponent down, but Khandozhko pops right back up. Keeping the aggression going, "Tiger" tags Khandozhko with a few sharp punches before clinching up again. Khabilov leans in to pursue a single leg takedown, and although he does not get it, he presses heavy on his opponent until Mitchell warns Khabilov to "use his position." Khandozhko looks up to the referee for guidance, but Khabilov ignores it and keeps trying to get him down. Another stern warning comes from the referee, along with one for grabbing the gloves, but Khabilov cannot succeed in his attempt, as Khandozhko is just too strong for now. Mitchell breaks them up, and both are so far apart that they miss with several striking attempts until Khabilov seeks out another single leg takedown. The round ends while Khabilov is still trying to get it, and he cannot.</p>

                  <h4>Round 2</h4>
                  <p>The second round begins with a loud leg kick from Khandozhko, and then he fires another on the outside while Khabilov ducks in to attempt a takedown, but is rebuffed. Undeterred, Khabilov pursues that single leg he tried so hard to hit last round, and although he hooks his arm under Khandozhko's knee, "Honda" stands him back up and thwarts the attempt. Although he briefly lifts up Khandozhko, he cannot get the taller man down as Khandozhko throws up a few short knees that land flush on the chin, causing Khabilov to stand up. Mitchell warns Khabilov to work, so he does just that and finally gets Khandozhko down. Khandozhko grabs the fence and is loudly warned not to do so, but gradually works his way to his knees and feet by walking up the cage wall. Somewhere, the words "Embrace the Grind" are circling around Mike Goldberg's mind, and Khabilov picks up and plants Khandozhko down on the ground. Khandozhko does not stay there for long, and works his way to cage again, so Khabilov slams in heavy knees to the thigh and spine -- warned for the latter by the referee -- while Khandozhko is stuck on his knees. Khandozhko finally muscles out and stands up, so he smiles at Khabilov as the horn blares.</p>

                  <h4>Round 3</h4>
                  <p>One last touch of gloves kicks off the final round of this grueling fight, and Khandozhko fires a big left hand at his opponent. Khabilov smiles, knowing that this is the opening he needed, and hits a takedown to get Khandozhko to his back. Unfortunately for Khabilov, like multiple times earlier, Khandozhko walks to the cage and gets back up, and lifts up the leg of his opponent to make Khabilov think that he might be taken down. A low kick from Khandozhko leads to another takedown from Khabilov, who has no interest in keeping this fight on the feet for long. Khabilov drops down some light punches on top, but seeks out a few submissions that are not even close, allowing Khandozhko to retain full guard position. Stuck on his back, Khandozhko throws heel kicks to the thigh that Khabilov does not even register, but the referee is back to warning Khabilov again for inactivity. "Tiger" tries to stay busy on top with short punches, and Khandozhko opens his guard in an attempt to buck his man off of him. The referee continues to plead for Khabilov to fight and not just essentially lay-and-pray his way to victory, and Khabilov finally obliges by posturing up with seconds left. Khandozhko forces his way to his knees, and thankfully this fight is over.</p>

                    <h4>Round 1</h4>
                    <p>A pair of light heavyweights with reputations for being devastating strikers despite holding knockout rates around 50 percent are entering the cage now, with Russia's Ankalaev (11-1, 2-1 UFC) as the biggest betting favorite on the card facing off against South African Lungiambula (10-1, 1-0 UFC). Trying to keep a lid on this matchup is referee Marc Goddard. There is no touch of gloves, as Ankalaev goes right to the leg kick, which might be the strike of the day so far. Lungiambula paws out his left hand to figure out his range, while his opponent pump fakes and then fires a head kick that grazes the side of Lungiambula's head. Each of Ankalaev's fakes seem to make Lungiambula back away, and the South African fighter evades another head kick attempt. Lungiambula absorbs a front kick and tries to respond with a looping right hand, but is at least a foot away from the target. As Ankalaev digs to the body again with a kick, Lungiambula swings a right hand with all his might, but the Russian ducks it successfully. Lungiambula has his back against the fence, and Ankalaev is throwing him off with all his fakes, before landing a heavy shot. Lungiambula fires back with a big right hand that drops Ankalaev, but he gets back to his feet quickly and Lungiambula cannot pounce on him. Lungiambula rips a combination that all connects on his opponent, and then he clinches up to search for a takedown but is stood up. As Lungiambula blocks a body kick, he wins a right hand, and then clips Ankalaev with another. His right hand is corked and ready to explode on the chin of his opponent, so Ankalaev smartly changes levels to pursue a takedown. The Russian manages to get Lungiambula for merely a second, but cannot keep him there for long, so Ankalaev seems content to drill knees to the midsection of his foe. To separate, Lungiambula throws a ferocious uppercut that just misses, and the two exchange as the round ends.</p>

                    <h4>Round 2</h4>
                    <p>Ankalaev begins the second round with a snapping right jab, and then follows that with an audible leg kick. Lungiambula tries to counter, but his opponent is well out of the way before he gets clipped. Lungiambula rushes in and trips Ankalaev down for a moment, and the Russian fights off the attempt and manages to get back up quickly. Ankalaev presses Lungiambula against the fence, and then takes his legs out and gets "Champion" down. Ankalaev tries to drop down some right hands, while preparing for the eventual explosion that is sure to come from Lungiambula. Moments later, Lungiambula does just that, trying to burst out of the position, and in the process sits up against the cage. Ankalaev pulls him back down and rains down more rights, but none are particularly effective until he switches to elbows. Several powerful elbows score from Ankalaev, who takes half guard and now is putting some serious ground-and-pound together. The elbows continue to come from Ankalaev, and Lungiambula has no choice but to take them flush again and again. After a steady diet of elbows, Lungiambula develops a cut above his right eye, and the blood has started to flow. Ankalaev remains on top pounding on Lungiambula until the round ends.</p>

                    <h4>Round 3</h4>
                    <p>The last round begins with a fierce right hand from Ankalaev, and Lungiambula counters so aggressively that when missing, he nearly spins himself over. <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/videos/highlightreels/UFC-Moscow-Highlight-Video-Magomed-Ankalaev-Takes-Out-Dalcha-Lungiambula-With-Front-Kick-14663">Ankalaev backs away and launches a front kick that blasts Lungiambula right on the chin, in a kick reminiscent of Anderson Silva vs. Vitor Belfort or Lyoto Machida vs. Randy Couture, and sends the South African fighter crashing to the canvas. Ankalaev follows it with a right hand, while Goddard sprints in to save a likely unconscious Lungiambula.</a> What a knockout, and in doing so, the Russian becomes the first man to finish Lungiambula with strikes and the first Russian tonight to beat a foreign opponent.</p>

                      <h4>Round 1</h4>
                      <p>We now enter the main card, where we stay at light heavyweight as Gamzatov (13-0, 0-0 UFC) attempts to keep his unbeaten record intact against a man once nicknamed "Russian Terror" in Abreu (15-3, 1-1 UFC). The third man inside the Octagon is referee Leon Roberts, who thankfully will not share a name as a combatant this time. The two men greet one another with a touch of gloves, and Gamzatov opens with a few low kicks. They both throw leg kicks at the same time and they clash legs, and then wind up to throw opposing, resounding body kicks at one another. Abreu swings a heavy low kick right below the knee of his opponent, getting Gamzatov to react. A left jab from Gamzatov leads to a response of a one-two from Abreu, but the Russian gets away from harm in time. Gamzatov stings Abreu with a right hand, and then fires a body kick that loudly slaps his opponent's midsection. The unbeaten fighter throws another low kick, and blocks a counter head kick. As Abreu walks him down, he absorbs a front kick, a low kick and a right hand over the top, but he does manage to check the leg kick. Trading leg kicks for a moment, Abreu ducks down to throw a looping left hook, but Gamzatov retreats before it lands. The Russian digs to the body with a straight left, so his Brazilian adversary fires back with a much more effective body kick. They come together and swing wildly, but nothing much comes from it. They two men kick at one another until the round ends.</p>

                      <h4>Round 2</h4>
                      <p>We begin the round with Abreu pressing the action, leaning in with a long right hand but allowing a counter from Gamzatov to clip him. Abreu rips to that lead leg again, and Gamzatov is not a fan of those kicks, so Abreu gives him one to the body instead. When Abreu throws another one of those heavy leg kicks, Gamzatov is able to check it in time, and he replies with a head kick that Abreu is able to guard. The Russian checks the cup of his opponent with a front kick, but there is no pause of the action. Abreu absorbs a body kick but uses the forward movement to fire a right shot off the bow, and Gamzatov rolls with it. Abreu attempts to throw an inside leg kick this time, and again Gamzatov checks it. As Gamzatov leads with a left, Abreu comes back with a combination that is punctuated by a leg kick that nearly turns Gamzatov around. Abreu tries to sit down on a left hand, but Gamzatov dodges the attack and walks his opponent down. As Abreu goes low with a kick, Gamzatov tries to throw back at him, so Abreu uses the opportunity to hit a takedown in the center of the cage. Gamzatov holds on tight, but Abreu drops down an elbow and a few punches until Gamzatov kicks off and gets to his feet. A punching exchange from them both ends this close round, much like the first.</p>

                      <h4>Round 3</h4>
                      <p>One more touch of gloves to kick off this last round -- your scores may vary so far -- leading to a head kick attempt from Gamzatov. Abreu utilizes good head movement to stay out of harm's way, and he replies with a low kick and then a high kick that Gamzatov catches. Not interested in taking the fight down, Gamzatov releases the leg and then eats the heavy leg kick that follows. Abreu lands kicks with body legs, and then throws a long straight left hand that partially lands. The two come together and try to trade, but the striking accuracy of this exchange and practically the entirety of the fight is very low. Gamzatov catches Abreu at the end of a right hand, causing the crowd to get excited. Gamzatov lands a right hand and then jumps in the air with a front kick, but does not score that flashy kick. Instead, what scores is a straight right to the body, but Abreu shrugs it off. As Gamzatov goes for a high-risk spinning kick, Abreu is out of the way and grabs hold of the waist of his opponent. Gamzatov turns out but ends with his back against the fence, with Abreu trying to sneak in some short knees. Gamzatov drops down to pursue a double leg takedown, but with nothing there, he bails on it and works the body instead. They separate, and it is Abreu who shoots in for a double with 20 seconds left in the fight. Gamzatov tries to land a few elbows but the fight ends before either man can make anything of it. Flip a coin on this one.</p>

                        <h4>Round 1</h4>
                        <p>Dropping back to welterweight, two men with various connections to <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fightfinder.php?search=yes&amp;association=American%20Top%20Team">American Top Team</a> are meeting in the center of the cage as Martin (16-5, 8-5 UFC) comes to blows with Emeev (18-3, 3-0 UFC). Referee Marc Goddard is on top of the action in this one. Martin is fired up for this one, that's for sure. He leaps out of his corner to charge towards his opponent, and starts off with a thudding leg kick. As he takes a counter from Emeev, he shakes his head, and then throws another leg kick. Emeev chases him down with a cluster of punches, but Martin makes faces at him. A crisp right hand finds the mark from Martin, and Emeev wears it well as he tries to get his jab going. Emeev abruptly leaps forward with a punch, and Martin takes it and talks trash at him. Martin is carrying on a conversation with the Russian, and as he does so, he kicks the leg out from Emeev. As Emeev goes down, Martin follows him to pursue a kimura, and ends up on his back but still holds on to the arm. Emeev barely keeps his hands together by linking fingers, and as he rolls out of danger, he gets back up. The Russian presses Martin against the fence and drops in several powerful knees right on his chin, and as the crowd cheers, Martin laughs and nods at the camera. While clinched up, Emeev lands a knee up the middle to the cup, and Emeev does not know what is going on. The crowd also does not approve of this, so after a brief break, Martin announces that he is ready to go and we continue. Martin snaps out a quick jab, and then follows with a right hand, but Emeev is out of the way in time. "Gorets" shoots in for a takedown, but Martin grabs hold of his neck so Emeev backs off. Martin stings Emeev with a nasty calf kick, and Emeev responds with a jab that bloodies the nose up of the American. Emeev clinches up to end the round.</p>

                        <h4>Round 2</h4>
                        <p>Round 2 begins with Martin ready and rearing to go again, so to back him off, Emeev keeps his left jab out. Emeev tags Martin with a low kick, and Martin laughs it off and throws his own calf kick. Another powerful calf kick from Martin lands, and Emeev's leg is starting to swell up quickly. Emeev shoots in for a takedown, and Martin senses the opportunity and pulls for a guillotine. As Emeev tries to work his way out, Martin signals that he does not have the submission, and he gives up on it as Emeev tries to take advantage of top position. Martin walks his way up the cage, and complains of taking a knee to the groin, but this time the action does not stop. Emeev complains about something, possibly of an eye poke or that his opponent is slippery, but Goddard implores them to keep fighting. As Emeev tries to time a takedown, Martin is ready with a short uppercut and then a nasty calf kick that slightly hampers the movement of Emeev. Martin tries to fire another low kick, but Emeev is ready and waiting with a huge right hand counter. He clips Martin on the chin, so Martin tries to attack the leg and once more, Emeev is prepared with that counterpunch. Martin shrugs them off and goes after that leg again, causing Emeev to swing it along with the kick to take some of the steam off of it. The Russian charges forward with punches, so Martin backs away and targets that calf again. Emeev connects with his jab a few more times, causing some more damage to Martin's nose, but Martin snatches hold of his opponent and pulls him down while searching for a submission. There is nothing to be found in that position, and the round concludes with Emeev on top.</p>

                        <h4>Round 3</h4>
                        <p>Between rounds, the calf of the Russian swells up even more, looking a little like Rory MacDonald's leg when he faced Douglas Lima the first time in Bellator MMA. Martin targets that lead leg to start the round, so Emeev shoots in for a takedown, but is stuffed as Martin looks for a neck. Emeev breaks away and Martin starts to work his left jab, so Emeev fires back with a left that catches Martin. Like much of the fight, Martin laughs off the punch and presses forward while looking for his left straight to right cross combination. Another powerful leg kick comes from Martin, and when Emeev tries to reply, Martin darts out of the way. When Emeev lands a snapping jab, Martin drops his hands and walks him down while shouting at him. Emeev tries to throw a looping right hand, and Martin times it well by bringing up a clean uppercut that catches Emeev square on the jaw. The Russian takes it without issue, but the leg kick that follows bothers him some more. Martin commits to his one-two, so Emeev shoots in and Martin staves it off without much effort. Another leg kick scores from Martin, and that calf has taken some serious punishment. With about 30 seconds left, Emeev comes at Martin, so Martin flicks out his left jab to disrupt the attack of the Russian. Emeev swings for the fences as Martin goads him on, and when he lands, Martin lifts his arms up and screams at Emeev to keep swinging. The fight ends before any more blows land, and there is no ill will between them as they embrace after the final bell sounds.</p>

                          <h4>Round 1</h4>
                          <p>A young lion in Ibragimov (8-1, 0-1 UFC) is set to meet a man 15 years his senior when he locks horns with longtime vet Herman (24-14, 1 NC; 11-10, 1 NC UFC). When Ibragimov made his professional debut, Herman had already set foot in a cage or ring as a pro 36 times; in contrast, when Herman first competed in 2003, Ibragimov was eight. Our referee is Vyacheslav Kiselev. A touch of gloves makes this fight official, and Herman starts, as many fighters have throughout the night, with a leg kick. Ibragimov responds immediately with a big overhand right, and Herman absorbs it. Ibragimov swarms him with punches, and protects himself with his back against the fence. The Russian briefly searches for a takedown attempt, but abandons it when Herman blocks it. "Short Fuse" floats up a knee that lands right on the chin of his opponent, and appears to have marked the nose up his opponent already. Ibragimov loudly groans with all his effort to throw Herman down, but Herman keeps his balance and slams some elbows to the face of his opponent. A few more powerful knees from Herman fly up to the nose of the Russian, who is taking damage despite theoretically holding the dominant position by grinding Herman's back against the cheese grater-like fence. The two separate, and Herman pushes out a long left straight and a few leg kicks. Ibragimov clips Herman right on the chin with a looping right hand, and the American eats it like a sandwich while throwing another leg kick. Ibragimov keeps wiping his nose, and then loads up on a right hand, but Herman sees it coming a mile away. He still manages to connect on Herman, and although he clinches up, he thinks better of it as he proceeds to sling heavy leather to end the round.</p>

                          <h4>Round 2</h4>
                          <p>The two greet one another with another touch of gloves, and get right back to business with big right hands. Ibragimov digs to the body with a right, and cracks Herman with a looping right hook, but Herman presses through to clinch up and consider a takedown. Ibragimov shoves it off and circles out, and scores a huge right and then a left that comes behind it. Herman takes them both flush and taunts the Russian by tapping his chin. Another two punch combination comes from Ibragimov, and Herman takes them and wobbles backwards mildly. Herman throws back hard and lands a leg kick, and then the two trade jabs. Ibragimov looks more labored with his wild looping punches, so Herman pushes into the clinch and nails Ibragimov with a short shot on the way in. The American slams in some knees home, and then bends Ibragimov over to blast him on the chin with a few more. Ibragimov reverses the position to search for a takedown, but Herman pulls in for a choke and Ibragimov bails. They separate and hammer each other with powerful punches, but the Russian looks spent. He still manages to hit Herman, but takes a long look at the clock with 60 seconds left in Round 2. This is a torrid pace these two are keeping, and they are swinging so heavily that it is impressive neither man has been dropped yet. Herman brings up a few knees, so Ibragimov pushes off and swings wildly. The round ends with Herman scoring a powerful elbow as the horn sounds, and Ibragimov appears visibly exhausted.</p>

                          <h4>Round 3</h4>
                          <p>The crowd erupts for these two light heavyweights, and they slowly amble towards one another to touch gloves one last time. Herman comes in with a combination, but Ibragimov counters with a left hook that dings Herman. As Herman wades in, Ibragimov wings a huge right hand that Herman takes and keeps walking forward. With Herman continuing to push the pace, Ibragimov whiffs with a telegraphed spinning back fist, and then takes a deep breath. A one-two from Ibragimov lands and Herman looks completely unfazed, so Ibragimov drops down to pursue a single leg takedown. Herman defends with a guillotine, but the Russian drags him down briefly. Herman gets back up with his back against the fence, and brings up some knees that have done great things for him throughout the fight. A few more sharp knees catch Ibragimov, and Herman hunts for the guillotine choke, although he uses the position not to choke his opponent but to slam some knees square on the Ibragimov's damaged nose. The knees and elbows from Herman have opened up more cuts on Ibragimov, but the Russian appears undeterred as he picks up Herman's right leg and slams him down with 85 seconds to go. Herman goes back and forth between guard positions, briefly looking for submissions like a kimura and a triangle choke, but Ibragimov stays heavy on top. Herman is throwing while on his back, and as Ibragimov advances position, Herman explodes back to his feet. The Russian is leaking plasma everywhere, and Herman is the one who lands effectively as the fight wraps. These two men are completely spent, and what a bloody, bruising battle that turned out to be.</p>

                            <h4>Round 1</h4>
                            <p>Two men in desperate need of a win are up now at welterweight, with Roberts (16-5, 5-4 UFC) clashing with powerful striker Imadaev (8-1, 0-1 UFC) -- and the latter holds all eight of his wins by knockout. Looking not to get hit in the face with an errant blow is referee Rich Mitchell. There is no touch of gloves, and instead -- you guessed it -- a leg kick to start off the fight by Imadaev. Roberts responds with one of his own, and then the two men trade body kicks. Imadaev swings with a big right hand, but Roberts times it well to shoot in for an unexpected takedown, but Imadaev stuffs it. The two jockey for position, and Roberts grabs a Thai Plum and fires up some powerful knees. They separate, and Imadaev has some reddening around his right eye from that bouquet of knees. Roberts slaps in a leg kick, and Imadaev replies immediately with a quick jab that make both men smile at one another. Roberts swings wildly at a right hand, and then slings a leg kick but falls over, so Imadaev chases after him and nearly lands a flying knee flush on the jaw. Roberts circles away, only to come back in and land the takedown this time. The Russian does not have any interest in staying on the ground, and comes right back up immediately and catches Roberts with an elbow. Roberts backs off and throws a leg kick that lands with an audible thud, and after a brief warning about outstretched fingers, Imadaev clips him on the chin with a right hand. Roberts goes after that lead leg with a few more kicks, and then swings a right hand that misses the mark by barely an inch. The round ends when Imadaev hits the takedown.</p>

                            <h4>Round 2</h4>
                            <p>The two march towards one another, and it is Roberts that leads the dance with a few quick jabs and then a slapping leg kick. Roberts then drops down for a takedown, but Imadaev reverses him and ends upon top briefly. The Russian latches on to his waist, but Roberts breaks the grip and pushes away without taking any damage from the position. A four-punch combination from Roberts lands effectively, but Imadaev immediately fires back with a salvo of punches that put him off balance and allow for Roberts to take his legs out and land a takedown for possibly one second. Imadaev pulls him back to his feet, and then grabs the fence to stand up and is warned for it. Roberts keeps the clinch high and tight, and throws several ferocious knees up the middle. Imadaev tries to time a knee and lifts up Roberts and plants him on the cage floor, but Roberts immediately stands back up. Another clinch ensues, and Roberts looks to set up more of those knees before instead aiming for several punches to the torso. The Brit plants a knee right on his opponent's solar plexus, and maintains heavy pressure until Imadaev circles out. On the break, Roberts aims for a big elbow, but the Russian is out of the way in time. The 10-second clapper sounds, and both men wind up for huge left hands. <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/videos/highlightreels/UFC-Moscow-Highlight-Video-Danny-Roberts-Stuns-Zelim-Imadaev-14665">Roberts lands first, sending Imadaev spinning and giving commentator Dan Hardy flashbacks of his performance against Carlos Condit years back. The Russian falls face-first, and is out cold, so Mitchell dives in to save the unconscious fighter from any further harm.</a> "Hot Chocolate" is the first fighter to ever finish Imadaev, and does so with style points. You almost couldn't land a cleaner left hand than that one.</p>

                              <h4>Round 1</h4>
                              <p>The only heavyweight contest on the card is our co-main event, as ranked contender Volkov (30-7, 4-1 UFC) welcomes short-notice replacement Hardy (5-1, 1 NC; 2-1, 1 NC UFC) into hostile territory. The referee of this 516-pound battle is Leon Roberts. Hardy runs towards his opponent but they touch gloves, and Volkov opens with an unexpected leg kick to start the fight. He lands a few more, and Hardy fires back with a long right straight. Hardy flicks out a jab, and Volkov hammers him to the body with a kick and then fires a jab at the American's face. Hardy looks to set up a big right hand, and as Volkov defends it with a kick, Hardy darts in to pursue a takedown. Volkov defends it and circles out, but takes a kick from Hardy. Hardy throws a jab to the body and then one to the head, so Volkov responds by flipping a quick head kick up that Hardy is able to block. A strong one-two comes from Volkov, and Hardy chases after him with some left jabs. Two more jabs from Hardy land successfully, so Volkov comes back with a similar string of punches. As Hardy punches the body, Volkov slaps him back to the midsection with a quick kick. Hardy keeps the jab going, and Volkov is out of the way but takes a leg kick. Volkov snaps a jab out that gets the crowd behind him, as they appear to be chanting his name. "Drago" walks him down with jabs and speedy kicks, and then clips Hardy on the chin with a right hand that makes Hardy lick his lips. Hardy pounces with two big left hands, but Volkov is no worse for wear as he throws out another body kick to his short-notice opponent. This surprisingly close round ends.</p>

                              <h4>Round 2</h4>
                              <p>The two grin and stare at one another as they touch gloves, and we are informed that Hardy may have injured his right hand in that first round. Hardy continues to pepper with that left jab, so Volkov throws a jab back at him and then a right. Hardy throws that potentially compromised right without ill effect, and Volkov is largely able to roll with it. The two trade leg kicks, but the volume is in favor of Volkov as he doubles and triples up on them. Hardy tries to throw back harder, and goes full power for a strike that is well short of the mark, and he nearly tumbles to the cage floor in the process. Hardy keeps his jab to the body going, and Volkov is content to pick at him with kicks at distance. As Hardy sets up a big right hand, Volkov clips him with a straight left, but Hardy still connects with that punch. Volkov digs to the body with a push kick, and Hardy leaps forward to attack the body in response. Volkov continues that gameplan, working the front kick to the midsection and catching Hardy with numerous kicks to the body when the American comes in. Hardy rushes in with a right, and then fires a spinning back first at his Russian opponent, but Volkov is able to block it. Volkov sneaks up a head kick that partially lands, and Hardy grins at him. Volkov works the body several more times with kicks, and he follows those punches with sharp jabs. As the horn sounds, Hardy limps back to his corner.</p>

                              <p>A final touch of gloves leads immediately to a front kick that tags Volkov on the chin. Hardy comes out like he was shot out of a cannon, swinging hard but not landing to great effect. Volkov stays tall and jabs at Hardy, and the American complains of an eye poke. Roberts contends that it was a knuckle, and we continue unabated. As they trade jabs, Hardy tries to close the distance but Volkov remains in kicking range. They go jab-for-jab, until Volkov commits on a few leg kicks that cause Hardy to flinch. As he lands a few low kicks, he fakes low and goes up with a head kick that grazes the chin of the former football player. Hardy grabs hold of Volkov's left hand in a jab, so Volkov fires a right hand that slams into Hardy's jaw. Hardy lets go and tries to keep jabbing, but his volume is about half as much as Volkov. As Hardy goes low, Volkov flings a head kick and again catches Hardy unaware, but Hardy walks right through it. With a minute remaining, the two trade heavy jabs, and then a big body kick from Volkov stuns Hardy momentarily. Another follows immediately, and then a head kick from Volkov sends something flying out of the cage -- it might be tape, or spit, or even Vaseline. Volkov keeps the distance striking going, and jabs and kicks his way until the final horn sounds, and we have surprisingly reached the scorecards.</p>

                                <h4>Round 1</h4>
                                <p>We have reached the main event of the afternoon, which at featherweight is unfortunately only scheduled for three rounds instead of five due to recent change in card lineup. Russian fans will be looking for one more emphatic win which have been few and far between tonight as they root for home country fighter Magomedsharipov (17-1, 5-0 UFC) against "The Boston Finisher" Kattar (20-3, 4-1 UFC). Our marquee matchup matador will be referee Marc Goddard. There is no touch of gloves, as Magomedsharipov leads in with some jabs and the secret words of the day -- "leg kick" -- as Kattar circles away. A long, straight left from Kattar catches Magomedsharipov on the chin, so the Russian replies with another leg kick. Magomedsharipov chases him down with several jabs and then strings together a solid combination, so Kattar responds with his own leg kick. Kattar blocks a body kicks and stalks Magomedsharipov down, landing a left and just missing with a looping uppercut. The jab from Kattar snaps his opponent's head back, but Magomedsharipov responds with a front kick that does so to a much greater effect. Another low kick from Kattar causes Magomedsharipov to nearly turn around, and then when he pushes in, Magomedsharipov kicks his leg out from underneath him with a leg kick. As Magomedsharipov presses forward, Kattar digs a leg kick, so Magomedsharipov flips a hook kick that just brushes the hair back of his opponent. A body shot lands from Magomedsharipov and then a step-in elbow, so as Kattar backs off, he puts together a combination as the two trade heavy leather. Kattar leaps in the air with a knee and clips Magomedsharipov, but the Russian is unconcerned with the attack as he wings a spinning back fist that catches Kattar flush. A few more striking exchanges punctuate the round dramatically.</p>

                                <h4>Round 2</h4>
                                <p>Magomedsharipov opens up with a several straight punches but Kattar defends himself without taking a lot of damage, and then sits back on his jab. The Russian rips the body with a spinning back kick, and then nearly lands a quick head kick that comes afterwards. Kattar advances, but Magomedsharipov is the one who lands as the American comes towards him. Magomedsharipov leaps in the air with a flying knee, and as soon as he lands, he throws a spinning back fist but Kattar is out of the way of both strikes. Magomedsharipov sinks in a few heavy leg kicks, and Kattar looks flustered as he tries to find more than a jab. Kattar does jab to the body and head, but Magomedsharipov throws power strikes in a stern right straight and a body kick. As Magomedsharipov shoots in for a takedown, Kattar stuffs it quickly and backs away when Magomedsharipov pursues him with strikes. They come together, and the Russian digs to the body, only to push off after landing that strike. Magomedsharipov presses forward, hits an unorthodox outside trip and gets Kattar down. As the "Boston Finisher" gets to his feet, Magomedsharipov takes his back, but Kattar is able to spin out without issue. Kattar checks a leg kick and tries to set up a one-two, but Magomedsharipov is putting together punches in bunches. As Kattar wings another big one-two, Magomedsharipov ducks and hits him back. Kattar sees that, throws a fake to draw out the ducking movement and clips Magomedsharipov with two sharp uppercuts. The two trade shots to end the round, with Magomedsharipov attempting a cartwheel kick while Kattar goes to the body. After the horn blares, Magomedsharipov sticks his tongue out at his opponent.</p>

                                <h4>Round 3</h4>
                                <p>The last round opens with several effective jabs, but Magomedsharipov backs away and nails Kattar in the cup with a heavy kick. Kattar gets a brief pause in the action, but he does not want to take a break for long. When we resume, Magomedsharipov hits a slick left to the body as he moves out of the way of Kattar's punches. Magomedsharipov gets off a few kicks, so Kattar tries to respond with two heavy leg kicks. Magomedsharipov taunts him by faking a spin, and Kattar continues to press forward. Magomedsharipov is on his back foot, and Kattar is walking him down as he lands a big right hand. The two stand in the pocket and trade heavy leather, with Kattar looking for that uppercut that landed in the previous stanza. Kattar jumps in the air with a knee, but Magomedsharipov is out of the way, so he responds with a spinning back elbow that Kattar blocks. Magomedsharipov shoots in for a takedown and again Kattar staves it off without much effort, and throws a few jabs followed by right hands to do some damage. Kattar loads up with a right hand, and Magomedsharipov is just out of the way in time, but he comes back with a big uppercut that appears to hurt the Russian. Magomedsharipov is backing away, and Kattar stalks him down as he starts to headhunt. Kattar rips to the body and Magomedsharipov stands before him and slugs right back. The two are trading, and Magomedsharipov's corner is likely begging for him to not play this game with the Bostonian. Kattar times a few more uppercuts that Magomedsharipov eats flush, and Kattar is turning on the pressure with less than a minute left. Kattar throws a Hail Mary flying knee and Magomedsharipov catches him in the air and slams him down, which is the worst thing that can happen for the American. On his back, Kattar throws everything and the kitchen sink at his opponent while the Russian holds on tight, and it is a real shame that this fight is only three rounds. The fight is over, and who knows what would have happened if this were scheduled for two more. With this fairly clear-cut win for the Russian, those from the home country have gone 4-7 tonight, producing a far lower winning percentage (.364) than the previous two events the promotion held in Russia.</p>
