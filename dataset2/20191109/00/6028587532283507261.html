      <p>Stocks that have more transparent earnings tend to outperform by about 13% a year. This is based on data from 1977 to 1996. Now, 13% a year is an impressive additional return. Especially because this comes after controlling for other factors that have historically helped returns including the small-firm effect (buying smaller companies over larger ones) and valuation (buying apparently less-expensive companies over more richly-valued ones).Transparency is defined as stocks with more predictable earnings. This can be measured in two ways. First off, one can look at the dispersion of analyst forecasts. Less transparent stocks have a broader spread between the high and low analyst forecasts of the company’s earnings. This is perhaps because analysts are less sure where earnings will fall. More transparent stocks have a narrower spread as analysts have more confidence in predicting earnings. </p>
      <p>Secondly, the error of the analyst forecast informs transparency too. If earnings are simply harder to predict, then the error between the average analyst forecast and the company’s earnings will be higher. So more transparent stocks have more predictable earnings as measured by analysts’ ability to predict them over time, and a smaller spread between the various outcomes that different analysts forecast for the same stock.</p>
      <p>This research feeds into the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonmoore/2018/06/09/how-owning-quality-stocks-can-help-performance/#371f874a573d">broader research on stock quality</a>. You might expect that you get rewarded for diving into those extremely risky stocks where the future is unclear. These sort of stocks are often called lottery tickets. Big potential upside, but a lot of downside risk too. For example, you might think that you you get rewarded for taking the extra risk of separating the wheat from the chaff across more troubled, or at least less predictable, companies. This doesn’t appear to be true, at least on average. If you stick with the more boring, predictable stocks that post predictable earnings quarter to quarter without big surprises in either direction, that has historically been a better performing strategy according to historical research. The reverse is true too, those stocks with harder to forecast earnings tend to lag the market.</p>
      <p>This research was performed by James Ang of Florida State University and Stephen Ciccone of the University of New Hampshire. You can read their full paper <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=271713&amp;rec=1&amp;srcabs=39966&amp;pos=2">here</a>. Another desirable property of the strategy is that over the period of analysis it was highly likely to produce positive returns each year. </p>
      <p>This is in contrast to other strategies such as size and value, which also offer the prospect of positive returns over time based on historical data, but are less reliable each year. That is to say, you have tended to make money over time with those strategies, but it’s far from certain that you’ll make money in any single year. Therefore, at least based on historical analysis transparency appears a useful factor to add to the mix and maybe more reliable than certain other factors, because the strategy is less likely to have bad years.</p>
      <p>Importantly, there is also some evidence that factor returns can be lower after their discovery. Once traders and investors see that certain strategies work, potentially those strategies become more crowded trades. Over time the returns to those strategies tend to decline. As such, the impressive returns to transparency may not persist into the future to the same degree, or at all. However, it is part of a growing literature suggesting that taking risk in order to improve return is sometimes an <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonmoore/2019/01/24/three-big-investing-myths-exposed-by-academics/#5df098470f8c">investment myth</a>. Simply sticking with the more predictable and steadier stocks may offer superior returns, on average.</p>
