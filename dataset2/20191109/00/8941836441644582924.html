      <p>PERTH, Australia (AP) - Australian <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ash-barty/">Ash Barty</a> continued her season-long extraordinary form to beat <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/france/">France</a>’s <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/caroline-garcia/">Caroline Garcia</a> 6-0, 6-0 and level <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/the-fed-cup/">the Fed Cup</a> final at 1-1 on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The world No.1-ranked <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ash-barty/">Barty</a> beat <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/caroline-garcia/">Garcia</a> in just 56 minutes on an outdoor hard court at Perth Arena to get <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/australia/">Australia</a> back on track after <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kristina-mladenovic/">Kristina Mladenovic</a> beat Ajla Tomljanovic, who was making her Fed Cup debut, 6-1, 6-1, to give <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/france/">France</a> the early lead.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ash-barty/">Barty</a>, who won her first major singles title at the French Open this year, extended her Fed Cup winning streak to 15 matches, a run that began in February 2017.</p>
      <p>“I think that’s probably the best tennis match I’ve ever played in my life,” she said. “I could not have asked for a more perfect match.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ash-barty/">Barty</a> is set to face <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kristina-mladenovic/">Mladenovic</a> in the first reverse singles match on Sunday.</p>

      <p>“I know she has the weapons to make me uncomfortable,” she said of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kristina-mladenovic/">Mladenovic</a>. “It’s about trying to nullify that the best I can.”</p>
      <p>Fresh off her record $4.42 million triumph at the WTA Finals in Shenzhen last weekend, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ash-barty/">Barty</a> overwhelmed the world No. 45-ranked <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/caroline-garcia/">Garcia</a> with potent serving and pinpoint shot-making. She finished with 15 winners and eight aces.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/caroline-garcia/">Garcia</a> struggled in the sweltering conditions with the temperature hitting near 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) on the opening day. She hit just three winners in her error-strewn performance.</p>
      <p>“She didn’t leave me a lot of space. She played well from the first point,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/caroline-garcia/">Garcia</a> said. “I was disappointed with my performance.”</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/australia/">Australia</a>’s hopes of ending a 45-year Fed Cup drought started poorly when <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kristina-mladenovic/">Mladenovic</a> beat Tomljanovic in 72 minutes.</p>
        <p>No.51 Tomljanovic was chosen over former U.S. Open champion Samantha Stosur as <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/australia/">Australia</a>’s second singles player behind <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ash-barty/">Barty</a>.</p>
        <p>The 26-year-old, Croatian-born Tomljanovic only received clearance from the International Tennis Federation to represent her adopted country last month.</p>
        <p>She was broken six times and had just two winners for the match.</p>
        <p>“It’s a tough task for Ajla playing straightaway in the final,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kristina-mladenovic/">Mladenovic</a> said. “I almost played a perfect match. I was really in the zone.”</p>
        <p>Tomljanovic admitted she struggled with nerves: “I wish I could have done better in the circumstances. It didn’t go as planned,” she said. “It’s really unique. You’re not playing for yourself, you’re playing for your country and teammates.”</p>
        <p>The Australian finally held serve on her seventh attempt, but it only slightly delayed <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kristina-mladenovic/">Mladenovic</a>’s inevitable victory.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/australia/">Australia</a> hasn’t won <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/the-fed-cup/">the Fed Cup</a>, then known as the Federation Cup, since 1974 when Evonne Goolagong, Dianne Fromholtz and Janet Young defeated the United States 2-1 in Italy.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/france/">France</a> last won <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/the-fed-cup/">the Fed Cup</a> in 2003 and most recently made the final in 2016.</p>
        <p>The final could well go to the doubles match, when <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ash-barty/">Barty</a> and Stosur will play <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kristina-mladenovic/">Mladenovic</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/caroline-garcia/">Garcia</a>.</p>
        <p>Both <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ash-barty/">Barty</a> and Stosur and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kristina-mladenovic/">Mladenovic</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/caroline-garcia/">Garcia</a> won three-set live fifth doubles matches in April’s semifinals to send their countries to the final. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/australia/">Australia</a> beat Belarus in the semifinals and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/france/">France</a> defeated Romania.</p>
