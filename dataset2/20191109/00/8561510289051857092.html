      <h1>Someone Published All the Membership Data From a Neo-Nazi Website</h1>

      <h3>Data Dump</h3>
      <p>Prior to its abrupt close in November 2017, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/07/neo-nazi-site-iron-march-materials-leak">Iron March</a> was one of the most influential neo-Nazi websites in the world. Investigators have linked the site to murders, acts of terrorism, and fascist groups in at least nine different countries.</p>
      <p>And now, thanks to a leak from an anonymous source, researchers have access to the entire contents of Iron March — including the user names, registered email addresses, and IP addresses of nearly 1,000 site members.</p>
      <h3>Hate Speech</h3>
      <p>On Wednesday, someone using the handle “antifa-data” posted a 1GB SQL database appearing to contain all of the data from Iron March to <a href="https://archive.org/details/iron_march_201911">the Internet Archive.</a></p>
      <p>In addition to info that could lead to the identification of Iron March members, the database also includes the contents of members’ public messages and private chats, much of which — as you’d expect from a neo-Nazi site— is rife with hateful speech and white supremacist rhetoric.</p>
      <h3>Dropping Names</h3>
      <p>Disturbingly, as <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/how-tos/2019/11/06/massive-white-supremacist-message-board-leak-how-to-access-and-interpret-the-data/">noted by <i>Bellingcat</i></a>, an open source journalism website, early analysis of the leak suggests that several Iron March members were active military personnel at the time they posted to the site. Others, meanwhile, expressed a strong desire to <a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-army/2019/11/07/desire-to-join-military-large-focus-of-leaked-chats-in-infamous-neo-nazi-forum/">join the military</a>.</p>
      <p>Several members of the site have been outed directly on social media already, including a former congressional candidate — and the leak is likely to help researchers and investigators identify numerous other neo-Nazis.</p>
