      <h1>Bakkt Sets New Volume Record After Bitcoin Price Tanks 6%</h1>

      <p>Bitcoin (BTC) hasn’t been doing too hot over the past 24 hours. As of the time of writing this piece, the cryptocurrency is down some 5% on the day — falling from yesterday’s peak of $9,250 to $8,700 — having lost the key $9,000 support level after holding strong above it for nearly two weeks’ time.</p>
      <p>Despite this decisively bearish price action, which some analysts say is preceding a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/08/analysts-target-move-to-8400-as-bitcoin-plummets-below-9000/">stronger drop to the low-$8,000s</a>, Bakkt’s Bitcoin futures market <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/08/bitcoin-dumps-bakkt-pumps/">has seen a flurry of activity</a>.</p>
      <p>Bakkt Volume Bot, a Twitter account dedicated to publishing data about the exchange’s derivatives market, reported an hour ago (6:00 EST) that Bakkt has seen 1,741 BTC worth of contracts traded on Friday. This is equivalent to around $15.5 million, and importantly marks Bakkt’s largest trading day thus far.</p>

      <p>This statistic was later corroborated by the exchange itself, who excitedly <a href="https://twitter.com/Bakkt/status/1192940915033329664">tweeted near the end of Friday’s trading session</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“Today we set a new daily record of 1,756 Bakkt Bitcoin Futures contracts traded.”</blockquote>

      <h3>Institutions Leaning Long on Bitcoin</h3>
      <p>Bakkt’s relatively high volumes have come as institutions have started to build long positions of Bitcoin through other regulated contracts.</p>
      <p>As <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/03/institutions-accrue-bitcoin-long-positions-as-price-looks-to-break-past-9300/">reported by NewsBTC previously</a>, Skew Markets found that institutional longs  on the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/01/cme-says-its-launching-bitcoin-futures-on-dec-18.html">Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s Bitcoin futures market</a> has hit a one-month high, reaching around 1,300 BTC worth of contracts. This is up by over five times from the bottom near 250 BTC seen in late-September.</p>
      <p>Skew added that institutions are now net long 880 BTC contracts, compared to 660 BTC the previous week, as short positions have fallen because institutions are likely expecting a breakout in the upward direction.</p>
      <p>Institutions, as defined by the <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/">CME</a>, are pension funds, endowments, insurance companies, mutual funds and those portfolio/investment managers whose clients are predominantly institutional.</p>
      <p>While some argue that institutions know no more about Bitcoin’s directionality than retail investors like you or I, some have argued that this is untrue. As <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/10/06/institutions-long-bitcoin-price-analysts-breakout/">reported by NewsBTC previously,</a> popular crypto trader Romano argued that institutions using the CME “have a good track record for the right directional trade,” having shorted BTC ahead of the Bakkt launch and the subsequent crash.</p>
      <h3>What’s Next for BTC?</h3>
      <p>Institutional crypto investors may be leaning long, but what are the charts saying is next for BTC?</p>
      <p>According to a Bloomberg columnist, this move, if it continues, will end at $8,000. Su Zhu, the chief executive of Three Arrows Capital, recently released an excerpt of a report from <a href="http://bloomberg.com/">Bloomberg’s</a> “monthly crypto market columnist.”</p>
      <p>The excerpt read that “the worst of this year’s Bitcoin price correction… in our view.” The analyst elaborated that they expect for Bitcoin to remain <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/07/bloomberg-analyst-explains-bitcoin-price-caged-8000-12000/">bound to the $8,000 to $12,000 range</a> until year-end; Bloomberg wrote that increasing institutional investment and a “favorable macroeconomic environment” should produce upside potential, but that “hangover selling from 2017’s price surge” should limit the upside, and potentially create some room for downside to the $8,000 region.</p>
