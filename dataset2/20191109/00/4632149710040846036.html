      <p><i>Disqualified MLAs pleaded SC to postpone bypolls until it announces verdict</i> <br/><br/>Supreme Court (SC) refused to entertain the plea of the disqualified MLAs to direct Election Commission (EC) to defer Assembly by-elections until it pronounced verdict. <br/><br/>As many as 15 assembly constituencies are going for bypolls, following the disqualification of 17 Congress and JD(S) MLAs. Elections to two constituencies – Maski and Rajarajeshwari Nagar were not announced due to pending election petitions in the Karnataka High Court. <br/><br/>The EC is set to issue a notification on November 11 for the bypolls scheduled on December 5, while November 18 is the last date for filing nomination papers. <br/><br/>The disqualified MLAs were hopeful that the three-member bench of the Supreme Court, headed by Justice NV Ramana will give its verdict on Friday. <br/><br/>The bench, hearing a batch of petitions by the 17 disqualified MLAs, had reserved its verdict on October 25. The senior counsel appearing for the Supreme Court, Mukul Rohatgi pleaded to defer polls as disqualified MLAs cannot contest unless SC announces its judgment. <br/><br/>The Court, however, refused to postpone elections and asked the counsel to file an application on Wednesday. <br/><br/><br/>Former Speaker Ramesh Kumar had disqualified 14 Congress and three JD(S) MLAs under the Anti-Defection Act. Later, the MLAs challenged the Speaker’s decision in the SC. <br/><br/><br/><b><u>BJP’s internal rumblings will lead to mid-term polls: Rao</u></b> <br/><br/><i>The Congress on Friday predicted internal rumblings in the BJP will pave way for mid-terms polls in Karnataka.<br/><br/>“Mid-term elections to the assembly look certain due to internal contradictions in the BJP,” Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president Dinesh Gundu Rao said. <br/><br/>According to him, BJP national president Amit Shah and other central BJP leaders were not happy with Yediyurappa. The State BJP president too has his own camp of followers. BJP legislators are also not happy with the Chief Minister, Rao said, adding that Yediyurappa has banked on just the disqualified MLAs. <br/><br/>Reacting to the Congress president’s statement, BJP general secretary N Ravi Kumar denied such contradictions in the party. <br/><br/>“This is all a figment of their imagination,” Kumar said, alleging that the Congress president was making desperate attempts to divert and deflect people’s attention.</i></p>
