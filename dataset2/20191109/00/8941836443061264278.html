      <p>BALTIMORE (AP) - The Maryland Republican whose social media posts about trash in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/baltimore/">Baltimore</a> ultimately led to President Donald Trump’s verbal attack of the late U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings says she’ll run for Cummings’ seat.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kimberly-klacik/">Kimberly Klacik</a> tells The Baltimore Sun she’ll file next week as a candidate for the 7th Congressional District special election. Cummings died last month. Primaries will be in February, with an April general election.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kimberly-klacik/">Klacik</a>’s videos of West <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/baltimore/">Baltimore</a> caught the attention of Trump last summer. The president blasted Cummings’ majority-black district as a “rodent-infested mess.” That set off a war of words with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/baltimore/">Baltimore</a> boosters.</p>
