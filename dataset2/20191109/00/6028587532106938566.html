      <p>Cofounders of Pinterest saw a steep drop in their fortunes this week after the company posted lackluster third-quarter earnings on October 31. Though the results only narrowly missed analyst expectations, Wall Street balked at the social media company’s soaring expenses, sending the stock plummeting. CEO Silbermann’s net worth sank by $300 million as the share price fell 23% between October 31 and November 7. The 37-year-old is now worth $1.2 billion. Cofounder Paul Sciarra, who left Pinterest in 2012, has been knocked from the billionaire ranks; he’s now worth an estimated $850 million after a $250 million drop.Pinterest reported revenue growth of 47% year-over-year to $279.7 million—a slight miss of 1%—but the third-quarter results did not satisfy analysts. Its monthly active users grew 28% to 322 million, beating estimates, but most growth was for its international user segment, which account for only 13 cents of revenue on average. Domestic users, which average $2.93 in revenue, only increased by 8%. </p>
      <p>More troubling, spending by the company nearly doubled to $413 million from the prior year but did not yield an immediate return.  Pinterest reported a net loss for the quarter of $124.7 million, up nearly sixfold from the year prior. The <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/carlieporterfield/2019/11/06/softbank-billionaire-masayoshi-son-humbled-by-46-billion-wework-write-down/#da83d21181ae">implosion of WeWork</a> and the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bizcarson/2019/11/04/uber-q3-earnings-revenue-beat-lost-another-billion/#6d6aa9d5306a">decline of Uber</a>, whose shares hit a record low this week, has reduced Wall Street’s patience for money-losing tech companies.</p>
      <p>Shares are still up from Pinterest’s $19 IPO price in April, but have declined nearly 46% since peaking at $36.83 in August.</p>
      <p>That said, some analysts remain bullish on Pinterest. Deutsche Bank has maintained its buy rating, citing Pinterest’s innovation in ad units and underlying technology. “Despite a slower trajectory in 3Q, we continue to see several levers for the company to sustain strong top-line growth and nothing that changes our long-term view of the company,” Deutsche Bank analyst Lloyd Walmsley wrote in a research note. “We would take advantage of the sell-off after earnings and surrounding the lockup expiration to add to positions.” (Deutsche Bank was an underwriter for Pinterest’s IPO). </p>
      <p>A former product specialist at Google, Silbermann launched Pinterest with Sciarra and Evan Sharp in 2010.  The Yale alum first made <i>Forbes</i>’ World’s Billionaires list in 2016 when his photo bookmarking site was valued at $11 billion after a fundraising round. “I hope Pinterest is my last job,” Silbermann told <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kathleenchaykowski/2016/05/03/pinterest-ceo-ben-silbermann-wants-to-build-the-ultimate-personalized-catalog/"><i>Forbes</i></a><i> </i>at the time. “I don’t think there are a lot of tools at scale that let you indulge in who you want to be.”</p>
