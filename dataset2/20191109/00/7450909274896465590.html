      <p>The New York State Athletic Commission has followed through on its promise to penalize <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Kelvin-Gastelum-74700">Kelvin Gastelum</a> and his coach <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Rafael-Cordeiro-422">Rafael Cordeiro</a> for what happened at the <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/events/UFC-244-Masvidal-vs-Diaz-76599">UFC 244</a> weigh-ins.<br/><br/>According to <a href="https://www.newsday.com/sports/mixed-martial-arts/ufc-244-nysac-fines-kelvin-gastelum-corey-anderson-1.38380976">Newsday</a> on Friday, the commission has levied a $1,000 fine on the middleweight, along with a $200 fine for Cordeiro.<br/><br/>Last Friday, Gastelum hit the scales amidst concerns that he would miss weight, and instead came in at 184 pounds, or two pounds below the middleweight limit. While weighing in, Gastelum <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/news/news/NYSAC-to-Penalize-Kelvin-Gastelum-After-Leaning-on-Coach-at-Weighins-164841">broke a rule</a> by coming into contact with coach Cordeiro. The commission investigated the incident, and found that Gastelum and his coach violated <a href="https://www.dos.ny.gov/athletic/pdfs/2014-2-weigh-in-policy-amended-4-13-17.pdf">this rule</a>, which states "No other person shall touch the scale when a combatant is in the act of weighing in." They were not the only two fined after UFC 244 ended, however.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Corey-Anderson-171723">Corey Anderson</a>, who was victorious with a first-round knockout of the highly touted <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Johnny-Walker-170203">Johnny Walker</a>, was handed a $10,00 fine -- the highest the commission can issue -- for "unsportsmanlike and disorderly conduct." This conduct ensued after Anderson finished Walker, and while celebrating he shoved referee Kevin MacDonald, shouted at Walker's corner and flipped middle fingers in the air. Anderson was quick to apologize for his actions, <a href="https://twitter.com/CoreyA_MMA/status/1190820483610095617">doing so on Twitter</a> while claiming "emotions got the best of me."<br/><br/>All three men are under an indefinite suspension from the NYSAC until they pay their respective fines.</p>
