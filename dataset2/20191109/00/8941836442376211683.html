      <h1>Price hits winning kick with no time left, CU beats Stanford</h1>

      <p>BOULDER, Colo. (AP) - Freshman kicker Evan Price made a 37-yard field goal with no time remaining as Colorado beat Stanford 16-13 on Saturday to snap a five-game skid and keep its flickering bowl hopes afloat.</p>
      <p>Price was promoted this week with James Stefanou dealing with an injury. Price was instantly mobbed by teammates, falling to the ground and losing his helmet. It was Colorado’s first game-winning field goal as time expired since Sept. 29, 2007, against Oklahoma.</p>
      <p>The Buffaloes (4-6, 2-5 Pac-12) need to win their final two games to become bowl eligible.</p>
      <p>Stanford (4-5, 3-4) must win two of its final three contests to extend its bowl streak to 11 straight seasons.</p>
      <p>Both teams have already been eliminated from Pac-12 title considerations.</p>

      <p>Colorado quarterback Steven Montez methodically drove the Buffaloes down the field to set up the winning score. The drive was aided by a pass interference call on Stanford’s Kyu Blu Kelly, who reached out to slow down Tony Brown on a deep pass. Colorado also went for it on fourth-and-short at the Stanford 34, with Laviska Shenault Jr. - banged up knee and all - churning for the yardage.</p>
      <p>K.J. Costello gave Stanford its first lead of the game early in the fourth quarter when on third-and-15 he found Simi Fehoko over the middle. Fehoko took it from there, splitting several defenders and bursting to the end zone for a 75-yard score.</p>
      <p>Midway through the fourth, Montez tossed a short pass wide of K.D. Nixon standing at the goal line. The Buffaloes settled for a 23-yard field goal from Price to tie the game at 13.</p>
      <p>Shenault went to the CU locker room late in the second quarter with a knee injury only to return. He had eight catches for 91 yards.</p>

        <p>Montez had a 13-yard TD run in the first quarter that catapulted the senior from El Paso, Texas, over the 10,000-yard mark for his career. He joins Sefo Liufau (10,509 yards from 2013-16) as the only Buffaloes in the 10K club.</p>
        <p>A big moment early was when Stanford’s Michael Wilson fumbled a punt and the Buffaloes recovered the ball inside the 10. But a holding call nullified the turnover.</p>
        <p>In the second quarter, Stanford defensive back J.J. Parson thwarted a drive by picking off his first career pass. Stanford turned it into a field goal with 9:09 remaining before halftime. Moments before, the Cardinal had a touchdown reversed on review, when it was ruled Fehoko had a foot out of bounds in the back of the end zone.</p>
        <p>THE TAKEAWAY</p>
        <p>Stanford: The Cardinal rarely lose this time of year. They fall to 25-8 under coach David Shaw in November.</p>
        <p>Colorado: Colorado improved to 64-36-5 all-time on homecoming.</p>
        <p>HALL OF FAME</p>
        <p>Former Colorado head coach Gary Barnett and other members of Colorado’s recently inducted athletic hall of fame class were recognized at halftime. Barnett went 49-38 over seven seasons (1999-2005). Among the other inductees were Jenny (Barringer) Simpson - the 2016 Olympic bronze medalist in the 1,500 meters - and late football coach Fred Folsom (his name is on the stadium).</p>
        <p>THIS &amp; THAT</p>
        <p>Colorado senior P Alex Kinney played in his 53rd career game. He moved into sole possession of games played, breaking a tie with Quinn Sypniewski (2000-05). … Ralphie, Colorado’s live buffalo mascot, was sidelined for the day.</p>
        <p>UP NEXT</p>
        <p>Stanford: At Washington State next Saturday.</p>
        <p>Colorado: After a bye week, host Washington on Nov. 23. The Huskies lead the series 11-6-1.</p>
