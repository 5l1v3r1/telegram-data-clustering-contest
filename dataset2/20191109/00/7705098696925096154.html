      <h1>The CW Reveals Dates for Arrow Series Finale and Legends Premiere</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T00:29:45+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 00:29</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Abbate</a></address>
      <p>This winter marks the end of an era as the <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/arrowverse"><b>Arrowverse</b></a>’s flagship series reaches its conclusion. After eight years, Stephen Amell’s Oliver Queen will officially hang up his emerald outfit when <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/arrow"><b>Arrow</b></a>’s final season wraps up in January. Now (via <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/the-cw-midseason-premiere-dates-katy-keene-return-dcs-legends-roswell-new-mexico-supernatural-moves-to-monday-1202781471/">Deadline</a>), The CW has announced exactly when this goodbye will take place.</p>
      <p>The network will bid adieu to <b>Arrow</b> with a special two-hour finale event that will air on Tuesday, January 28. The event will kick off at 8pm with a “finale preview,” followed by the actual final episode at 9pm. Fittingly enough, the last episode is titled “Fadeout.” It’s anyone’s guess as to what The CW has in store for the preview portion of <b>Arrow</b>’s sendoff. However, it’s possible that they’re organizing some kind of retrospective featuring clips from past episodes and maybe even some interviews with the cast and crew.</p>

      <p>Although viewers will no longer get to see Oliver Queen every week, the <b>Arrowverse</b> will still live on thanks to the various other DC shows on the network. The CW has also announced that <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/legends-of-tomorrow"><b>Legends of Tomorrow</b></a> will premiere its fifth season on January 21 at 9pm. Technically, this won’t be the first <b>Legends</b> episode we’ll see in 2020. One week earlier, on January 14, <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/crisis-on-infinite-earths"><b>Crisis on Infinite Earths</b></a>’ final installment will air under the <b>Legends of Tomorrow</b> banner as well. The season premiere will likely address the fallout from the events of the crossover.</p>
