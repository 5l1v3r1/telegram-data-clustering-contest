      <h1>Voice of the Mirror: Schools will suffer under Tories despite election promises</h1>
      <h2>As National Education Union analysis shows, the majority of the extra cash is going to Tory constituencies as the Nasty Party devises a funding formula that punishes some of the poorest areas</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T00:01:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 00:01</time> by <a rel="author">Voice of the Mirror, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/voice-of-the-mirror/</a></address>
      <p>It is wise never to take any Conservative election promise at face value.</p>
      <p>That is particularly true when they claim they are increasing education funding.</p>
      <p>A National Education Union analysis shows not only will most schools be worse off than they were in 2015 but that the majority of the extra cash is going to Tory constituencies.</p>
      <p>In wealthy South East England, schools will get an extra £157 per pupil.</p>
      <p>By contrast, West Norwood in London faces a £782 real-terms loss with Liverpool Riverside and Manchester Central down £644 and £597 respectively.</p>
      <p>Only Tories could devise a funding formula that punishes some of the poorest areas and rewards some of the most prosperous.</p>

      <p>This piles injustice upon injustice as it deprives inner city schools which have more pupils with special needs, eligible for free meals or with English as a second language.</p>
      <p>If the Tories cared about giving every child the best start, they would not have cut funding by £7billion or axed 500 Sure Start sites.</p>
      <p>Labour vows to reverse cuts and create 1,000 new Sure Start centres. It is the only party with a genuine interest in your kids’ futures.</p>
      <h3>Floody foolish</h3>
      <p>Once again, we have been battered by heavy rainfall and torrential flooding.</p>
      <p>Tragically, a woman lost her life after being swept away by floodwater.</p>

      <p>The devastation has seen homes and businesses destroyed and thousands evacuated.</p>
      <p>Scientists say these severe weather events are a direct consequence of global warming and will only become more commonplace.</p>
      <p>More cash has been spent on defences but most went to the South of England rather than the North – which is more prone to heavy rain.</p>
      <p>The people of Derbyshire and Yorkshire are now paying the price for this foolish decision.</p>
      <h3>Heroes live on</h3>
      <p>The nation will stand still at 11am tomorrow to remember its fallen.</p>
      <p>Their wars grow more distant with time but we will never forget their heroism.</p>
