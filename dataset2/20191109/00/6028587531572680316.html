      <p>With the five-time Ballon d’Or winner’s current deal set to expire in 2021, FC Barcelona president Josep Bartomeu wishes to offer Lionel Messi an ‘indefinite’ contract to see out the rest of his career in Catalonia. In an Associated Press interview this weekend, Bartomeu told Joseph Wilson that the club is ‘preparing for the post-Leo Messi era’.</p>
      <p>‘In the next two or three seasons, our leader will continue to be Leo Messi,’ said Bartomeu. ‘But it is true that there there are other young players who will come. Players who come from abroad, but also players who come from our La Masia academy. And we are very happy because we are preparing for this era after Messi,’ it was added.</p>
      <p>At 32, however, Messi - depending on how he well he can maintain his physical condition - has three to five years left in him that Bartomeu wishes to see played at the outfit that reared him from adolescence.</p>
      <p>‘I always make a comparison with Pelé,’ explained Bartomeu. ‘Pelé was a man from only one club [in Brazil]... [and] I have no doubt that after Messi ends his career as a footballer, he will remain linked to this club for the rest of his life,’ Bartomeu insisted.</p>
      <p>‘Leo Messi's contract ends in 2021,’ he went on. ‘But it will surely be the will of all parties involved, if they feel strong and ambitious, to extend this contract indefinitely,’ finished Bartomeu emphatically.</p>
      <p>Coming to the end of his own tenure in the same year, Bartomeu cannot run for president again and would therefore leave a legacy beyond a sole Champions League win in 2015 and four La Liga titles to date by locking Messi down until retirment.</p>
      <p>Recently revealing in his own interview to TyC of Argentina that his family does not wish to return to the South American country - so that he can enjoy a stint at Newell’s Old Boys where he began his soccer journey - convincing Messi to sign on the dotted line indefinitely may not be the most difficult of propositions.</p>
      <p>Last refreshing terms in November 2017, he agreed to extend his time with Barcelona through to 2020–21 by being promised an annual salary and bonuses of at least $80 million per annum.</p>
      <p>Showing no signs of letting down during his 15th year in the top flight, Barcelona would have to match or even surpass those figures and boost earnings supplemented by a lifetime deal with Adidas and additional endorsementes from the likes of Pepsi, Gatorade and Huaewei.</p>
