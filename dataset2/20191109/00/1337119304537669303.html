      <p>Instagram has been running tests where it hides like counts on posts in seven different countries around the world, and very soon, it will start testing hiding them <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/instagram-hiding-likes-adam-mosseri-tracee-ellis-ross-wired25/?utm_campaign=wired&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_social-type=owned&amp;utm_brand=wired&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;mbid=social_twitter">for some US users</a> as well. Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri <a href="https://twitter.com/WIRED/status/1192962986224128005?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1192962986224128005&amp;ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc">made the announcement</a> today at the WIRED25 conference.</p>
      <p>In tests that have rolled out so far, likes are hidden from public posts in the Feed, on the web, and in profiles. However, you should still be able to see how many likes a post gets — it’s only other people that won’t be able to.</p>

      <p>The test first started <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/30/18523847/instagram-hide-likes-test-canada">in Canada</a>, and it has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/17/20697943/instagram-hide-public-like-count-test-ireland-italy-japan-brazil-australia-new-zealand">also rolled out</a> to Ireland, Italy, Japan, Brazil, Australia, and New Zealand.
