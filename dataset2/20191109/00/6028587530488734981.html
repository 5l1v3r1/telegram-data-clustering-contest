      <h1>Exploring Austria’s Kreuzenstein Castle</h1>

      <p>On a small hill on the outskirts of Vienna is <a href="http://www.kreuzenstein.com/">Kreuzenstein Castle</a>, parts of which date back to the 12<sup>th</sup> century. It’s a stunning, fairy-tale of a place, with a moat (now dry), towers, and a fantastic view. Being so close to Vienna, it’s an easy afternoon trip. So that’s exactly what my friends and I did, timing it just right to get a guided tour, and have an early dinner at the adjacent restaurant that serves medieval food.</p>
      <p>Here’s what it’s like up close.</p>

      <p>If you have a car it’s way easier. We did not. The closest train station is <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/ktg3UcBr5EWqUWN78">Leobendorf-Burg Kreuzenstein</a>, and after that it’s a bit of a walk… then a bit of a hike up the mountain. At 869 feet its not <i>high</i> per se, but it’s not nothing. On the way up we walked along the road. There were only a few cars, but no sidewalks on the hike up. There’s a path through the woods, which we took on the way down and is a way better option.</p>

      <p>The castle itself is fantastic up close. High walls perched on top of a small hill is the kind of thing you’d expect to find only in movies or video games. And indeed, a few movies were shot here.</p>

      <p>There are only a few tours per day, and that’s the only way it. Enter through a person-sized part of a much larger door, and pay at a small kiosk. The walled ramp that brings you up into the castle courtyard is suitably epic.</p>

      <p>You can imagine a medieval society going about it’s day-to-day within these walls, even though the current castle is a mix of structures and designs from throughout the last several centuries. This is a living place, not a static, decaying structure. Parts, however, are certainly more museum than not, with weapons collection of swords and pikes, and a kitchen centered around a stone hearth.</p>

      <p>The tour is in German, which is fine unless your German doesn’t go much beyond “Bier, bitte.” However, a sheet with info is available in English at the gate. Plus, I was with to native German speakers who helped me out. Our tour guide was also fluent in English, so the few questions I had she was able to answer with ease.</p>

      <p>Inside is a mix of wood-walled coziness and stone-walled coldness. Pictures were, sadly, off limits.</p>

      <p>As fun as the castle is, my favorite part by far is the adjacent restaurant, <a href="http://www.burgtaverne-kreuzenstein.at/">Burgtaverne Kreuzenstein</a>. Using seasonal ingredients and medieval recipes they create dishes that not only go with the mood of the castle, but also are worthy of trying in their own right.</p>

      <p>I had the Medieval Roast Pork with Honey Onions, which came with fried dumplings and hand pomegranate seeds on top. I have to say, it’s one of the best things I’ve had in half a dozen trips to Austria. It was sublime. Or to put it another way, I’d go back to that restaurant, hike and all, just to have that again.</p>

      <p>After our early dinner, we made our way back down the hill to the train station.</p>
      <p>Adults are 12 euros. The castle is open most of the year, but closed for the winter. To find out more info, <a href="http://www.kreuzenstein.com/">check out their website</a>. </p>
