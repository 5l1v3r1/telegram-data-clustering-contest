      <p>The main event of Saturday’s UFC Fight Night 163 featured a featherweight matchup between Zabit Magomedsharipov and Calvin Kattar. When the 145-pound contest began, Magomedsharipov was the No. 5 ranked fighter in the official UFC featherweight rankings, while Kattar came in at No. 11. The odds favored the higher ranked fighter. Magomedsharipov entered the octagon as a -310 favorite over Kattar, who was the +240 underdog.Both fighters looked relaxed when the bout began. Kattar’s boxing, which is his strong suit, seemed much cleaner and efficient than Magomedsharipov’s striking early in the contest. A great deal of that might have had to do with the fact that Magomedsharipov is a more freewheeling fighter than Kattar.</p>
      <p>For most of the first round, Magomedsharipov looked to work from distance while Kattar attempted to us a long jab and hard straight right to tag his opponent. Magomedsharipov did use varied striking attacks from distance early. He also seemed to loosen up as the round wore on.</p>
      <p>Magomedsharipov looked much more relaxed at the start of the second stanza. He also seemed to lose any apprehension he had during the first five minutes of the contest. He fought much closer to Kattar in the second round, which reduced Kattar’s ability to use his boxing, which relies on a fair share of distance. Magomedsharipov, who had racked up 25 takedowns in his first five fights with the UFC, attempted a surprisingly fast outside trip takedown, but Kattar was quick to get back to his feet. </p>
      <p>Kattar knowing he was most likely behind on the scorecards heading into the third and final round, pressured his opponent and landed some inside leg kicks of his own. Kattar then rocked Magomedsharipov with two minutes left in the round. </p>
      <p>With Magomedsharipov retreating, Kattar looked to score a knockout blow. In somewhat of a surprise, when Kattar closed the distance, Magomedsharipov elected to get into a firefight with his heavy-handed opponent. After the two broke apart, Kattar attempted a flying knee, but Magomedsharipov saw it coming and turned it into a takedown, putting Kattar on his back. However, Magomedsharipov couldn’t do anything on the ground because Kattar kept throwing strikes from his back until the horn sounded to end the fight. </p>
      <p>The bout was by far the best of the night. Magomedsharipov won the contest with three scores of 29-28 from the cageside judges. </p>
      <p>The fight, which was elevated to main event status on short notice, would have been much more interesting had it gone five rounds, as Magomedsharipov’s cardio seemed to be fading a bit near the end of the third round. Magomedsharipov addressed the fact during his post-fight interview.</p>
      <p>During the 15-minute contest, Magomedsharipov landed 100 of 255 total strikes, while Kattar scored with 127 of his 260 attempted total strikes. Magomedsharipov kept alive his streak of landing a takedown in each of his UFC fights, going one for four in that department. Kattar did not attempt a takedown. Neither fighter went for a submission.</p>
      <p>As for signifiant strikes, Magomedsharipov landed 96 of 250. He scored with 45 head strikes, 14 body blows and 36 leg kicks. Kattar landed 80 of 213 significant strikes. His preferred target was Magomedsharipov’s head, where he landed 61 strikes. Kattar also hit his opponent to the body 11 times and scored with eight leg kicks.</p>
      <p>UFC Fight Night 163 took place Saturday at CSKA Arena in Moscow. The entire fight card streamed on ESPN+.</p>
