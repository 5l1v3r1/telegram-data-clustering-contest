      <p>It’s been a big year for 50<sup>th</sup> birthdays. From Jennifer Aniston and JLo to Matthew McConaughey and Sean Coombs, it seems like everyone is having a milestone birthday in 2019. But this isn’t really a big surprise when you consider that in the Generation X (1965-1980) cohort, 1969 was one of the largest birth years.As these birthdays pass, it’s clear that Gen X is now hitting midlife. But as many of them are finding out, the older we get, the better life is. At the same time, Gen X needs to really think about how they are going to handle a long retirement. Currently many Gen Xers are helping their own parents navigate longevity. While there are many positives to a long life, the path is also fraught with risk.</p>
      <p>Gen Xers are clearly thinking about these risks. In the <a href="https://transamericacenter.org/docs/default-source/retirement-survey-of-workers/tcrs2019_sr_what_is_retirement_by_generation.pdf">2019 Transamerica Study on Retirement Savings, 51% of Gen Xers surveyed were concerned that they would outlive their savings.</a> Yet at the same time, Gen Xers are struggling to save as they navigate the complexity of midlife financial planning.</p>
      <p>But there is a tool that is available to Gen Xers that might be the best account they fund for retirement: Health Savings Account (HSA). These accounts are triple tax exempt and a unique way to save for future medical costs in retirement. And the generation best poised to embrace these accounts and make them key to retirement success is Gen X.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Longevity and The Gen Xer</b>
      </p>
      <p>Longevity planning is becoming more common as more people are living well into their 90s or even early 100s.  This is in sharp contrast to lifespans when Gen Xers were born. For Gen Xers born at the beginning of the cohort in 1965, the average male life expectancy per <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/NOTES/ran2/an2015-2.pdf">Social Security Administration</a> was 66.8 years and 73.8 years for women. By the end of the cohort in 1980, the average male life expectancy had increased to 69.9 years for men and 77.3 years for women. Today for a baby born in 2019, life expectancy has increased to 76.6 years for men and 81.3 for women.</p>
      <p>But as life expectancy continue to increase, the real number GenXers should focus on is the <a href="https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/retirement/plan-for-a-long-retirement-tool">probability that they will live to a certain age</a>. For a married couple who are both 50 years old today, the man has an 18% chance of making it to age 90. The female has a 30% chance. But the likelihood of either of them making it to age 90 is 42%. </p>
      <p>Those are pretty high odds. Further what Gen X needs to also think about is that in retirement, the earlier expenses are more about lifestyle. As one lives longer, medical expenses dominate retirement spending. Planning needs to happen today to help ensure there are funds available to cover costs as one ages.</p>
      <p>
        <b>HSA All the Way!</b>
      </p>
      <p>That’s where HSAs come in. These accounts are available to individuals and families who are enrolled in High Deductible Health Care Plans (HDHCP) that are HSA compatible.  The HSA can be funded with $3,500 for an individual plan and $7,000 for a family plan in 2019 (this will increase to $3,550 and $7,100 respectively in 2020).  This deposit provides a tax deduction. The funds grow tax deferred and if used for qualified medical expenses, it’s a tax-free distribution.</p>
      <p>But here’s the key for Gen Xers – rather than using the HSA to cover medical costs in the current year, they need to shift their mindset to see this as a retirement account. By investing the funds and allowing the money to compound, Gen X provides themselves with a bank of funds to cover medical costs in retirement. </p>
      <p>While the idea of investing the funds seems obvious, from the data we have on HSAs, the majority of users are not maximizing it.<a href="https://www.ebri.org/docs/default-source/ebri-issue-brief/ebri_ib_482_roleofhsas-23may19.pdf?sfvrsn=c2b73f2f_10"> In fact, the Employee Benefit Research Institute found that only 7% of HSA users are investing the funds.</a></p>
      <p>GenX would should invest the funds into a long-term investment strategy. The EBRI found that the average 65 year-old couple today need $301,000 to cover medical expenses. If the younger members of Gen X embrace HSAs today, they have a real chance to get fully funded. For older Gen Xers who are in their 50s, they can likely get almost 2/3rds of the way there.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Longevity Is A Gift</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ultimately the ability to live a long life is a gift. But it is only a gift when we have the ability to have financial security. In order for Gen Xers to embrace longevity, they need to embrace and utilize an HSA. This requires planning on funding a HSA until age 65 and investing the funds. Then, and only then, can they be confident that they are fully covered on longevity risk. Afterall, at age 50, they may only be halfway through a very long life.</p>
