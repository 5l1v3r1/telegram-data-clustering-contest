      <p>Two suspects in the ambush-slay of radio block timer Dindo Generoso in Dumaguete City have been arrested, Philippine National Police (PNP) Officer in Charge Lt. Gen. Archie Gamboa said on Friday.</p>
      <p>The suspects were identified as Teddy Reyes Salaw, 44, a resident of Batinguel, Dumaguete City, and Glenn Corsame, a retired policeman.</p>
      <p>Gamboa, citing a report from the Police Regional Office 7, said Salaw yielded a .45 caliber pistol.</p>
      <p>The acting PNP chief commended Visayas policemen for their swift action that resulted in the arrest of the two.</p>
      <p>Right after Generoso’s attack by a riding-in-tandem that killed him on the spot, Negros Oriental Provincial Police Office (NOPPO) chief Col. Julian Entoma expedited the investigation and tracked down the assailants.</p>
      <p>“I’m confirming the arrest of two suspects yesterday [Thursday]. Our tracker teams were quick to act because of the CCTV footages that identified them, their pick up and escape routes and other details,” Entoma says.</p>
      <p>Investigators said Corsame is a resident of San Jose Village in Barangay Banilad, Dumaguete City. He was reportedly the driver of motorcycle used in the killing.</p>
      <p>Generoso, 67, was attacked and killed at around 7:25 a.m. on Thursday while driving his Hyundai Elantra with plate number YKU 946 at Barangay Piapi on his way to his program at the local radio station 96.7 dyEm FM Station.</p>
      <p>Investigators were continuing to investigate the motive behind the attack.</p>
      <p>The National Union of Journalists of the Philippines (NUJP) commended the Negros Oriental police for its swift action that led to the arrest of Salaw and Corsame.</p>
      <p>“At the same time, the fact that two of the alleged killers are policemen is cause enough for worry and reinforces the findings of informal studies by media organizations that tend to indicate the involvement of state security personnel in many journalists’ murders in the country,” it said in a statement.</p>
