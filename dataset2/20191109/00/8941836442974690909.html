      <p>NEW YORK (AP) - A New York regulator is investigating Goldman Sachs for possible sex discrimination in the way it sets credit limits.</p>
      <p>The investigation follows a series of viral tweets by entrepreneur and web developer David Heinemeier Hansson about algorithms used for the Apple Card, which Goldman Sachs manages in partnership with Apple.</p>
      <p>Hansson said the card offered him a credit limit 20 times greater than it gave to his wife, even though she has a higher credit score. He called the algorithm a sexist program.</p>
