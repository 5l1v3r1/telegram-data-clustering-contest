      <p>ANTALYA, Turkey (AP) — Matthias Schwab extended his lead to three shots with a 6-under 66 in the third round of the Turkish Airlines Open on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old Austrian has a tour-best nine top-10 finishes this season. He had led overnight by one stroke as he chases his first European Tour title.</p>
      <p>For the second straight day, Schwab started with an eagle and also had six birdies and one double bogey.</p>
      <p>“I got off to a really nice start on the first hole with the eagle that I made and then played solid golf all around except for that one little hiccup,” said Schwab, who has an 18-under 198 total. “The game plan is going to be the same as it’s been the last three days. The course is gettable and there are a lot of birdies out there, so I’ll just stay aggressive because pars won’t be enough.”</p>
      <p>Patrick Reed shot his second straight 65 to join a group of five players in second place on 15 under at the Montgomerie Maxx Royal. The others are: England’s Ross Fisher (68) and Tyrrell Hatton (65), Scotland’s Robert MacIntyre (67), and France’s Benjamin Hebert (64).</p>
      <p>“Any time you shoot 65, you’re happy. There’s a lot I left out there today,” Reed said.</p>

      <p>Two-time defending champion Justin Rose shot a 1-over 73 and is nine strokes off the pace.</p>
      <p>England’s Eddie Pepperell did not even finish his round and was disqualified for failing to complete the fourth hole, his 13th of the day.</p>
      <p>Pepperell was 2 over for the round after dropping shots on the second and third and then hit his approach to the next into the water guarding the green. In a scene reminiscent of the “Tin Cup” film, Pepperell had several more attempts — even his caddie could not say for certain whether it was four or five — before informing playing partners Martin Kaymer and George Coetzee that he had run out of balls.</p>
