      <h1>Inside KSI and Logan Paul's pro training camps ahead of rematch</h1>
      <h2>The YouTubers will headline a sold-out Staples Center this weekend, with Billy Joe Saunders on the undercard</h2>

      <p>YouTube sensations KSI and Logan Paul face off in the boxing ring for a second time in the early hours of Sunday morning - this time as professionals.</p>
      <p>Some 14 months on from their first meeting in the ring under amateur rules, the social media stars are topping the bill at a sold-out Staples Center in Los Angeles this weekend.</p>
      <p>Despite world champions Billy Joe Saunders and Devin Haney defending their straps on the undercard, the main event will see two rookes make their pro debuts.</p>
      <p>The bout is being promoted by Matchroom's Eddie Hearn, who also has the likes of Anthony Joshua in his stable of boxers.</p>

      <p>With the headguards removed and the duo trading blows with 10oz gloves, their training regimes for the rematch have been far more thorough this time around.</p>
      <p>It seems both KSI and Paul have been taking the training seriously, with both spending time working under some of boxing's biggest names.</p>
      <p>And the pair have not been shy in offering fans a glimpse into their preparation for one of the year's most talked about fights.</p>
      <p>Paul goes into this weekend's bout as the odds-on favourite to triumph and has been spending time with a former heavyweight world champion in his bid to beat his fierce foe.</p>
      <p>Ex-WBO champ Shannon Briggs has been working with the 24-year-old's team in recent months and was even part of the online star's training camp.</p>
      <p>And even though Paul is gearing up for his first bout as a pro, it seems Briggs did not go easy on his fellow American.</p>

      <p>‘Things are completely different this time around – the camp…it’s like a death camp right now," revealed the 24-year-old's best friend Mike Maljak.</p>
      <p>"There’s absolutely no distractions, the entire team is ready to die for this victory.</p>
      <p>"Shannon's got one goal and that’s to go in the ring and kill his opponent. There’s no distractions, no bull***, no “I’ve got to make up for Tokyo, or I’ve got to make up for YouTube.”.’</p>
      <p>"Logan doesn’t plan on there being one punch he feels. He is going into that ring to eat – to literally eat – KSI is a meal for him.</p>
      <p>KSI, meanwhile, has been working closely with Viddal Riley, himself a veteran of three pro bouts at cruiserweight.</p>
      <p>Riley is relatively young for a trainer at just 22, but he clearly has an ability to coach after signing a promotional deal with Floyd Mayweather's promotional company.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old, whose real name is Olajide Olatunji, has spent time at training camps in Las Vegas and Los Angeles ahead of his pro debut.</p>

      <p>And he was even able to knock one about out in sparring, demonstrating the power KSI boasts in his gloves ahead of Saturday's rematch.</p>
      <p>Judging by their training, it seems Saturday's fight may justify it's main billing - even if it is between two men making their pro debuts.</p>
