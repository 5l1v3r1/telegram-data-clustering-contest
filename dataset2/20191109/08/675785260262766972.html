      <p>Football fans will always tell you their team's stadium is the best.</p>
      <p>Supporters of a club know it better than anyone else, and will be able to tell you all the secret, unusual and interesting facts about their home ground.</p>
      <p>But while every stadium in the world will have a quirk to some degree, some stand out as being slicker than your average.</p>
      <p>Here we take a look at six grounds from around the globe that really catch the eye.</p>
      <p>From a football stadium built to resemble a castle - taking the meaning of turning your home ground into a fortress to a whole new level - to a pitch quite literally in the middle of nowhere.</p>
      <h3>Igraliste Batarija</h3>

      </p>
      <p>Managers often talk about making their home ground a fortress. A place where teams fear to come and leave without points, well this Croatian side take the meaning to a whole new level.</p>
      <p>Home of HNK Trogir, this ancient ground is situated off the Adriatic coast on a tiny island with a castle behind each goal, making it a literal fortress.</p>
      <p>With Kamerlengo Castle behind the south goal and San Marco Tower located next to the north these 15th-century heritage sites help make Igraliste Batarija the first stadium on our list.</p>
      <h3>Undir Myruhjalla</h3>

      <p>
        <b>Capacity: 2,000</b>
      </p>
      <p>Located 440 miles north of Scotland this dainty stadium in the Faroe Islands sits inside the Skagafjordur fjord in Eysturoy.</p>
      <p>This 40 km long glacier runs from Trollaskagi in the east to Skagi Peninsula in the west and it is in between the deep valley below where Skala IF play their home matches.</p>
      <p>From the depths of the dale to the highs of European football, the home side hosted IK Start in the first qualifying round of the UEFA Cup in 2006.</p>
      <h3>BBVA Bancomer Stadium</h3>

      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Capacity: 53,500</b>
      </p>
      <p>The only mega-stadium on this list. Opened in August 2015, Estadio BBVA Bancomer looks like any regular modern-day ground unless sat in the north-west corner.</p>
      <p>That's because only from here can you view the Cerro de la Silla mountain and the nearby peaks while also watching Liga MX side Monterrey.</p>
      <p>With a capacity of 53,500 it's the biggest stadium on our list.</p>
      <h3>Al-Shamal SC Stadium</h3>

      </p>
      <p>How do you better HNK Trogir's ground of playing next to two 15th-century heritage sites?</p>
      <p>The answer: playing inside the castle instead.</p>
      <p>Home to Al-Shamal SC, this stadium is said to resemble a Qatar fortress with a rook in each corner of the pitch.</p>
      <p>The home side currently operate in Qatargas League, the second division of Qatari football and also boast teams in handball, volleyball, basketball and table tennis.</p>
      <h3>Vozdovac Stadium</h3>

      </p>
      <p>Built on top of a shopping centre, this ground is one of the few rooftop stadiums in the world, situated 24 metres above the road.</p>
      <p>Named after the home side, the Vozdovac Stadium is by far the most popular football arena in the city of Belgrade but hosts the third most prestigious team behind Red Star and Partizan.</p>
