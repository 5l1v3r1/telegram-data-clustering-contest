      <p>Reality TV sensation <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/caitlyn-jenner">Caitlyn Jenner</a> regularly shares glimpses inside her Malibu beach haven after the devastating LA fires nearly burned it to the ground last year.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/keeping-up-with-the-kardashians">Keeping Up With The Kardashians</a> star, 70, expressed her gratitude last December when she revealed her home survived the Woolsey Fires, which destroyed much of the Southern California area.</p>
      <p>It was initially feared that the former Olympic champion had completely lost her mansion in the fire, but it was later revealed her home is still standing and now looks better than ever.</p>
