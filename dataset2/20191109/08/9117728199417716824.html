      <h1>Miami GP receives another lifeline from city mayor!</h1>

        <b>The mayor of Miami has issued a veto against those who oppose the event, handing it another lifeline in its battle to become a Formula 1 Grand Prix. F1's owners, Liberty Media, have identified Miami as one of it's 'destination cities' and seems very keen to host a race there.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The track is set to be based around the Miami Dolphins' Hard Rock Stadium, but a county commissioner for Miami Gardens spoke out against the race, and her attempt to block it was passed by a vote late last month.</p>

      <p>However, Miami-Dade mayor Carlos Giminez has breathed life back into the plans with his veto, encouraging both sides to find an acceptable agreement to allow the race to run.</p>
      <p>He said in a statement that he didn't want to see a <i>"premature to attempt to block an event of the magnitude of Formula One outright."</i></p>
      <p>Giminez continued:Â <i>"I remain committed to respecting the residents of Miami Gardens, and I remain committed to finding a way to bring this world-class event to our community."</i></p>
      <p>The veto will go to a vote soon, so hang tight! In the meantime, what do you make of Liberty Media's 'destination cities'?</p>
