      <p>CAMARILLO, Calif. (KABC) -- One year after the mass shooting at the Borderline Bar and Grill, survivor Hannah Sindaha continues to process so many emotions.<br/><br/>Fear, grief and survivor's guilt, just to name a few.<br/><br/>But this remarkable young woman knew exactly what to do at the Borderline shooting because she'd been through this before.<br/><br/>To meet Hannah Sindaha, a vibrant young woman from Camarillo, you would never know the horror she has lived through, not once, but twice.<br/><br/>Her story begins in Las Vegas. The Route 91 concert, Oct. 1, 2017.<br/><br/>"It was actually my first concert," she said. "I went with two of my really good friends, my best friends."<br/><br/>A joyful weekend suddenly would turn into the worst mass shooting this country has ever seen. And Hannah, just 19 at the time, found herself running for her life.<br/><br/>"I started running. And I was like praying and running and running, and then a girl next to me got shot," Sindaha said. "I could hear it going on and I was just like 'Oh my God, I can't believe this is happening.'"<br/><br/>It was as she was running out of the venue, that the girl right next to her was shot and collapsed.<br/><br/>"I was still crying, praying and I was just trying to get out of there because I was like - I'm next. 'Cause I saw her go down and I'm running in the same place." She said.<br/><br/>It was chaos. Hannah says they had no idea where the bullets were coming from. Was it one gunman? Was it several? Was he running among them?<br/><br/>"I just thought he was in the venue. So I thought once I could make it out and make it into a hotel, I'd be safe. I didn't think he'd be above us."<br/><br/>It turns out the shooter was in the Mandalay Bay Hotel across the street, on the 32nd floor shooting down into the crowd.<br/><br/>By running out of the entrance, Hannah, and everybody else, was actually running towards the gunman.<br/><br/>More than 500 people were shot and 58 did not survive.<br/><br/>In the months that followed, Hannah struggled with nightmares and panic attacks.<br/><br/>But a photo captures a moment of joy. A photo that was taken Nov. 7, 2018, showing Hannah, happy to be with friends at the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks.<br/><br/>But only minutes after snapping the picture, as she's standing at the bar with her girlfriend, a sound now all-too-familiar rings out.<br/><br/>"When I heard the first gunshots, I automatically knew what it was right away. So I grabbed her shoulder and I shoved her to the ground. And then I was like freaking out because I couldn't believe it was happening again," She said.<br/><br/>Only this time, it wasn't a huge venue. It was a tiny space where people were piled on top of each other.<br/><br/>Hannah could see the smoke from the gunman's weapon and, this time, had complete clarity on what she had to do.<br/><br/>"We needed to get out of there," she said. "So, yeah I was hiding behind the bar and I just looked and I did not want to do it but I knew I had to because I had a better chance of living. If I maybe got shot, it's harder to hit a moving target - is what I was thinking - by running out and leaving and risking that instead of sitting there."<br/><br/>It was the right move.<br/><br/>The gunman, who stood only a few feet from her, shot more than 50 rounds in that crowd.<br/><br/>Thirty-two people were hit. Twelve didn't make it.<br/><br/>She shares with me photos from weeks later, showing me something called "Friendsgiving."<br/><br/>It's a beautiful gesture from her family and friends, as they mourn those who were lost, but celebrate Hannah's survival.<br/><br/>It helps as she continues to deal with survivor's guilt and demons from the trauma.<br/><br/>But there is wisdom in all of this as well.<br/><br/>"I would never wish it upon anyone else. It's just you have to take it day by day. Life is a blessing. And you can't take anything for granted."<br/><br/>Hannah is a survivor. It's important to point out that what she did in both cases is textbook.<br/><br/>If you find yourself in an active shooter situation the rule is "Run, Hide, Fight."<br/><br/>If you can't run, then you hide. If you can't hide then you fight.<br/><br/>Hannah ran and is alive today because of it.<br/><br/>For Hannah, even after the shooting stopped, it didn't end the stress.<br/><br/>The day after the shooting she had to evacuate her home due to the Woolsey Fire.</p>
