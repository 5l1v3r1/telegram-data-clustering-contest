      <h1>India's top court hands disputed religious site to Hindus</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T08:16:17+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 08:16</time> by <a rel="author">Euronews with ReutersÂ </a></address>
      <p>India's Supreme Court ruled on Saturday in favour of a Hindu group in a long-running battle over a centuries-old religious site also claimed by Muslims, in a verdict that could raise tension between the two communities.</p>
      <p>The ruling paves the way for the construction of a Hindu temple on the site in the northern town of Ayodhya, a proposal long supported by Prime Minister Narenrda Modi's ruling Hindu-nationalist party.</p>
      <p>The five-judge bench, headed by the Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, delivered a unanimous judgement, opting to hand over the plot of just 2.77 acres (1.1 hectares) of land to one of the Hindu groups that had staked claim to it.</p>
      <p>The judge said a temple should be built on the disputed site by forming a trust under the control of the central government.</p>
      <p>The verdict will be seen as a political victory for Modi, who won a second term in a landslide general election win this year.</p>
      <p>For more than seven decades, right-wing Hindu campaigners have been pushing to build a temple on the site, which they believe was the birthplace of Lord Ram, a physical incarnation of the Hindu god Vishnu.</p>
      <p>They say the site was holy for Hindus long before the Muslim Mughals, India's most prominent Islamic rulers, built what was known as the Babri mosque there in 1528.</p>
      <p>The mosque was razed by a Hindu mob in 1992. The destruction of the mosque triggered religious riots in which about 2,000 people, most of them Muslim, were killed across the country and led to a series of court battles with various groups staking claim to the site.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court directed that an alternate land parcel be provided to a Muslim group that had staked claim to the disputed site.</p>
      <p>The site has been heavily protected since the 1992 religious clashes.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the ruling, security was tightened in Ayodhya and across India, especially in cities that have suffered communal violence in the past.</p>
      <p>In some regions, restrictions were placed on gatherings and police were monitoring social media to curb rumours that could fan tension between the communities.</p>
      <p>In some towns, internet services were also suspended to stop the spread of rumours.</p>
      <p>The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh - the parent organisation of Modi's party - has decided against celebratory processions if the verdict goes in favour of the Hindus, to avoid provoking sectarian violence.</p>
      <p>Muslim organisations have appealed for calm to prevent communal flare-ups.</p>
