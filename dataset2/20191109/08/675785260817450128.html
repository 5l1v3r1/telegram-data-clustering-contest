      <h1>The inside story of KSI vs Logan Paul rivalry ahead of YouTube rematch</h1>
      <h2>KSI and Logan Paul clash for the second time when they meet in the professional boxing ring in Los Angeles tonight</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T08:00:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Domin, https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfighting</a></address>
      <p>Whatever the result of tonight's fight between YouTube stars KSI and Logan Paul, questions will continue to rage over whether their rivalry is real or manufactured.</p>
      <p>The latter is nothing new in the world of combat sports, particularly when huge sums of money are involved.</p>
      <p>And even in this brave new world of social media boxing, it is difficult to see the wood for the trees.</p>
      <p>According to KSI, he first met Paul at Super Bowl LI in 2017 when the New England Patriots fought back from a 28-3 deficit to beat the Atlanta Falcons 34-28.</p>
      <p>But the American disputes his claim and insists he only became aware of his British rival when he called him out following his win over Joe Weller a year later.</p>
      <p>KSI said: "If any YouTuber wants it they can come and get it. Jake Paul, Logan Paul, any of the Pauls I don't care. Bring it."</p>

      <p>Logan's younger brother Jake made the same claim only for KSI to reveal he was a follower of his on social media.</p>
      <p>Indeed, it was Jake who was initially set to fight KSI but he stepped aside for elder Paul brother and instead agreed to fight KSI's sibling Deji.</p>
      <p>Paul visited KSI at his gym and handed him a contract, saying: "I came here to close a deal, let's get a deal done, bro,"</p>
      <p>The American had initially wanted the fight to take place in a neutral venue such as Dubai, but eventually a two-fight deal was agreed.</p>
      <p>The first bout would take place on August 25 at the Manchester Arena last year before the rematch in America the following February.</p>
      <p>On the night, the arena was sold out with a 21,000-capacity crowd in a venue which had been Ricky Hatton's home for many years during his reign.</p>

      <p>But after six rounds, the rivals could not be split, with two judges scoring the fight a draw and the third giving KSI the nod by a single point.</p>
      <p>Regardless of the result, both men saw their bank accounts inflated overnight and although reports that the pair earned $40m each from the fight were quickly rubbished but both did rake in a seven-figure sum.</p>
      <p>The fight generated $11m (£8m) from YouTube pay-per-view after fans were charged $10 (£7.50) to stream the fights.</p>
      <p>Negotiations for the rematch quickly stalled, however, as the pair argued over a venue before Paul claimed KSI had breached the contract.</p>
      <p>"He already broke the contract, by the way," he said. "We’re supposed to fight in February, and he’s refusing to."</p>
      <p>KSI responded by saying he wanted to delay the fight until May this year with Dubai his preferred venue - although he accepted he might have to travel to America.</p>

      <p>In the meantime, leading promoter Eddie Hearn was sounded out about his interest in promoting the second fight and agreed on the condition that both KSI and Paul turned professional.</p>
      <p>They were subsequently licensed by the California State Athletic Commission and the fight was agreed on the further condition that the undercard would consist of professional fights rather than YouTubers, as the first one was.</p>
      <p>Given the professional nature of the sequel, Paul recruited former heavyweight world champion Shannon Briggs as his trainer while KSI drafted in Floyd Mayweather's uncle Jeff to assist head coach and professional fighter Viddal Riley.</p>
      <p>Paul trained in Los Angeles while KSI began his camp in London before moving to Las Vegas for the final stages.</p>
      <p>Both men have promised violent knockouts which would send the other into social media retirement.</p>
      <p>But the question is, will this change boxing for good or be just a dubious footnote in its storied history?</p>
