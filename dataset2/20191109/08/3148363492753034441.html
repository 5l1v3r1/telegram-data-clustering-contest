      <h1>Next EU Chief Defends NATO After Macron's 'Brain Death' Comments</h1>
      <h2>BERLIN (AP) — The president-elect of the European Union’s executive Commission is defending NATO after French President Macron claimed that a lack of U.S. leadership is causing the military alliance’s “brain death.”</h2>

      <p>Ursula von der Leyen didn’t explicitly address Macron’s criticism in a speech Friday but said that, even though there has been “bumpiness” recently, “NATO has proven itself superbly as a protective shield of freedom.”</p>
      <p>Macron said the European members of NATO “should reassess the reality” of what the alliance is in light of the U.S. commitment.</p>
      <p>Von der Leyen, who will succeed Jean-Claude Juncker in one of the EU’s top jobs in the coming weeks, said that “NATO was and is always what its member states make of it — it is up to 29 countries to participate and change something.”</p>
