      <p>News of the reunion was quickly followed by fan speculation over who would be drumming for <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/gerard-way">Gerard Way</a> and co. Now, representatives for the band have confirmed to <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/8542727/my-chemical-romance-reunion-fantasy-set-list"><i>Billboard</i></a> that their former sticksman Jarrod Alexander will be taking on the role once more.</p>
      <p>An Editor’s Note in one of the outlet’s recent MCR post states: “This article has been edited to note that Jarrod Alexander will be the drummer for My Chemical Romance’s reunion show.”</p>
      <p><i>Billboard</i> writer Chris Payne’s also wrote on Twitter that the group’s label had confirmed Alexander’s return. However, it’s not yet clear as to whether the musician will remain in the band for next year’s run of shows.</p>

      <p>Alexander joined My Chemical Romance back in 2011 as a touring member, following the departure of Bob Bryar the previous year. He filled in on their Honda Civic tour gigs.</p>
