      <h1>Liverpool vs Man City combined XI as Robbie Savage selects eight Reds</h1>
      <h2>Liverpool will host Premier League title rivals Man City at Anfield on Sunday in a top-of the table grudge match. Pep Guardiola's men pipped the Reds to the crown last season by a point</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T08:48:09+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 08:48</time> by <a rel="author">Robbie Savage, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/robbie-savage/</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool have lost only one of their last 50 Premier League games – against Manchester City, a result which ultimately cost them the title last season.</p>
      <p>But I expect them to prosper in the Anfield cauldron in this weekend’s top-of-the-table clash.</p>
      <p>If Jurgen Klopp’s side win on Sunday, they will be nine points clear at the summit.</p>
      <p>In other words, for City to catch them, Liverpool would have to lose three of their last 26 games in a league where they have lost only one of the previous 50.</p>
      <p>That seems as unlikely as a repeat of last season’s 0-0 draw at Anfield, especially as both teams have struggled to keep clean sheets in recent weeks.</p>

      <p>Just for fun, I’ve compiled a combined Liverpool-City XI – based on both squads, minus long-term injuries – and it reflects a slight shift in the balance of power at the top.</p>
      <p>In a 4-2-3-1 formation, they would line up: Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Van Dijk, Matip, Robertson; De Bruyne, Fabinho; Sterling, Firmino, Mane; Aguero.</p>
      <p>If he wasn’t out for the long term, Aymeric Laporte would make the back four.</p>

      <p>Maybe it’s a reflection of City’s slight vulnerability at the back that none of Pep Guardiola’s other defensive alternatives makes the cut.</p>
      <p>And perhaps that will be reflected in a narrow Liverpool win this weekend.</p>
      <h3>Unai Emery's problems mounting - but Arsenal nay sayers should be in dugout</h3>
      <p>Unai Emery's problems at Arsenal are not getting any easier after the Gunners coughed up yet another lead in Portugal during the week.</p>
      <p>Plenty of former Arsenal players and pundits have been having their say on Emery's difficulties and, like everyone else, they are entitled to an opinion.</p>

      <p>But it makes you wonder sometimes: If it's so easy to spot what's gone wrong at the Emirates, why aren't these people sitting in the dugout and calling the shots as manager?</p>
      <h3>I have no doubts Son was upset but Andre Gomes was the real victim</h3>
      <p>Not for one second would I doubt that Heung-min Son was genuinely upset by the outcome of his challenge that left Everton's Andre Gomes with a harrowing injury.</p>

      <p>As someone who had his leg broken by a poor tackle and got a phone call to apologise four or five days later – I accepted the apology, although I wasn't convinced it was entirely sincere – I have no doubts at all that Son was genuinely upset.</p>
      <p>You could tell, from his goal celebrations in Tottenham's emphatic Champions League win in Belgrade, that what happened to Gomes was still on his mind.</p>
      <p>But let's not forget the real victim in a horrible incident which upsetting for everyone involved.</p>
      <p>His name is Andre Gomes.</p>
