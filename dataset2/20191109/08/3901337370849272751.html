      <p>As one of the best dressed coaches in the PSL, Steve Komphela now has a rival in the drip department with Cape Town City coach Jan Olde Riekerink being an astute dresser himself. Check it out!</p>
      <p>When Komphela presents himself to the public, the Golden Arrows mentor hardly ever puts a foot wrong as far as his dress sense is concerned.</p>
      <p>Whether it be personalised sneakers or perfectly tailored shirts and trousers, Komphela has the style to match his prim and proper spoken word.</p>

      <p>As for Riekerink, the Dutchman joins a club many have deemed as one of the coolest teams in the country. With that, the former Galatasaray mentor can easily fit in with the style icons at City if his dress and grooming is anything to go by.</p>
