      <p>This completely new vehicle will be the ninth vehicle to be assembled at the Leipzig plant, counting towards the 1,000 production output capacity. "We are proud to produce the new four-door coupe at the Leipzig plant for the entire world market. This new vehicle leads to a significant increase in volume, "emphasizes plant manager Hans-Peter Kemser. 2019 will also be a big year for the Leipzig BMW plant, with the 1 Series joining the assembly line in the middle of the year. That means two completely new and high volume BMW vehicles will start rolling out its doors, part of its trategic alignment towards the main production location for BMW entry-level models. The plant has also gone through some major changes, with expansion of its paint shop and integration of the resource-saving paint process, as well as a bigger press shop, body construction area, assembly line, and logistical processes. "At the same time, the plant is realizing a 300 million euro investment program every day with around 1,000 vehicles in full production," says Kemser.</p>
