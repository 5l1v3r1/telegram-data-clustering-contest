        <b>Sheffield United and Ireland striker David McGoldrick was denied his first Premier League goal after VAR adjudged that his teammate John Lundstram was offside in the build-up.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Blades were 1-0 down in their game against Tottenham away from home thanks to Son Heung-min’s 58th minute goal but looked as though they had grabbed an equaliser 20 minutes later when McGoldrick met Ireland teammate Enda Stevens’ cross from the left.</p>
      <p><a href="https://punditarena.com/features/oisinmcqueirns2758/if-ever-a-man-deserved-a-goal-for-ireland-it-was-david-mcgoldrick/amp/">McGoldrick</a> celebrated what would’ve been his first goal in the top flight, only for VAR to chalk it off for an offside in the build-up after over three minutes of deliberating.</p>

      <p>The ball was played on the right to John Lundstram who crossed it into the Spurs area, but Eric Dier managed to clear the ball away.</p>
      <p>John Fleck picked it up before playing a pass out to Stevens whose delivery was met by McGoldrick at the back post.</p>
      <p>VAR adjudged that there was an offside in the ball into Lundstram, <a href="https://twitter.com/SheffieldUnited/status/1193203615583875073?s=20">whose toe it appears,</a> was said to have been ahead of the Tottenham defender.</p>

      <p>It was disappointing for both The Blades and McGoldrick as his search for a first Premier League goal continues, the Irish striker though was involved in their eventual equaliser, notching up an assist for George Baldock.</p>
      <p>The controversial decision will likely cause VAR to come under continued scrutiny over the next few days as the new technology dominates the discussion once again.</p>
