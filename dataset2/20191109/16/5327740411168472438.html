      <p>Gas in the Lower Mainland has seen a 15-cent drop in per-litre price since Wednesday – a welcoming change at the pump for local commuters.</p>
      <p>GasBuddy.com was reporting a number of Vancouver stations listing prices at $1.29 per litre on Saturday morning. The cheapest spotted prices outside of the Greater Vancouver area included $1.24 per litre in Langley and $1.30 in Maple Ridge.</p>
      <p>In the Fraser Valley, where pump prices don’t include the 17-cent transit tax, costs varied from $1.21 per litre in Abbotsford to $1.27 in Hope.</p>
      <p>Dan McTeague with Gas Price Wizard confirmed that Wednesday saw the biggest single-day drop to gas prices across southwestern B.C. in over a decade.</p>
