      <p>A Heidelberg teacher was rushed to a local hospital after a Grade 4 pupil allegedly threw his pencil case at her.</p>
      <p>The teacher was struck in the face but was discharged from hospital on the same day after receiving medical attention.</p>
      <p>The Sakhile Primary School pupil has since been suspended following the incident on Tuesday, confirmed Gauteng Department of Education spokesperson Steve Mabona.</p>
      <p>It is understood that the perpetrator left through a broken palisade fence and returned to the school with his grandmother and aunt.</p>
      <p>"The circuit manager and the school principal related the incident and informed them that their child was suspended with immediate effect, which they acknowledged," says Mabona.</p>
      <p>"The parents were taken in confidence and assured that the Departmental procedure will unfold as per the legislation, which will be facilitated by the [school governing body]. Further it was agreed that the learner will be allowed to write his examination."</p>
      <p>A hearing will take place after November 20.</p>
      <p>"Learner ill-discipline will not be tolerated in our environment which must always be conducive for teaching and learning," Mabona says.</p>
      <p>"It is indeed regrettable and embarrassing that a learner could harm a person that should teach, nurture, and mentor him. Teachers play a significant role in our schooling environment; hence we advocate for their respect always. Learners must be reminded that teachers are their parents and they should be treated as such,” he says.</p>
      <p>The teacher is currently recuperating at home and the Department’s employee wellness officials are have offered her support, Mabona adds.</p>
