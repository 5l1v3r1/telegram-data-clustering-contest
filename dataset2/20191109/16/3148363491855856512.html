      <p>The arrest took place this week in the border city of Nogales, Sonora, when 14-year-old Arizona resident Ramses Adrian [last name omitted] reportedly drove a black Ford Explorer without license plates from Arizona into Mexico. According to information released by Mexico’s Attorney General’s Office, as he approached the Mexican customs station, authorities red-flagged the teenager for inspection. The teen reportedly refused to stop and attempted to drive away.</p>

      <p>In his attempt to flee, the teenager crashed into a Mexican Customs Police vehicle giving authorities an opportunity to surround him and arrest him, Mexican officials stated. While searching the vehicle, police found a .50 caliber rifle, two AK-47 rifles, two 9mm handguns, and nearly 7,000 rounds of ammunition.</p>
