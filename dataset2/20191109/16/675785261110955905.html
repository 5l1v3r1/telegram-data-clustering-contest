      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T16:00:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author">Jane Lavender, Beverley Lyons, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>Children's presenter Karim Zeroual has stunned judges with his dance floor prowess.</p>
      <p>Last weekend the actor was at the top of the leaderboard with his incredible Quickstep routine with partner Amy Dowden.</p>
      <p>Shirley, Motsi and Bruno all awarded the couple 10s, while Craig spoiled their run with a nine.</p>
      <p>But behind Karim's smiles and slick moves he hides a devastating heartbreak after losing his best friend, Louelle Michie.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old daughter of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/coronation-street">Coronation Street</a> actor John Michie died at the Bestival music festival in 2017.</p>

      <p>Her boyfriend, Ceon Broughton, was jailed for her manslaughter after supplying her with the Class A drug 2CP.</p>
      <p>Karim was left devastated by Louella's death, who he has described as his "sister and best friend".</p>
      <p>A close friend of his <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/strictly-star-dedicates-appearance-tv-20059343">told the Daily Record:</a> “Karim thought the world of Louella and loved to dance with her.</p>
      <p>"There is no doubt she will be in his mind during some of the more emotional moments of the show. He really adored her.”</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old and Louella were often seen at festivals together and were described by those who knew them as "kindred spirits".</p>

      <p>Louella used to call Karim her "little man" while he referred to her as "My G", a gangsta expression which means close friend.</p>
      <p>The pair had been close pals for five years before Louella's tragic death just hours before her 25th birthday.</p>
      <p>She had even nominated him for an Ice Bucket Challenge back in 2014.</p>
      <p>And Louella seems to have helped inspire him for Strictly glory with videos of the pair showing off their dance moves on his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> page.</p>
      <p>Following her tragic death more than two years ago, Karin said: "“Words can’t describe how I feel today. You were so special to me.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"The years we had together and the times we had have always been jokes, because you were never without a smile.</p>
      <p>“The only girl in the world I can call my best friend and my sister. I love you forever and always. RIP beautiful Lou. Gone too soon."</p>
      <p>Broughton was jailed for eight years and six months for Louella's manslaughter.</p>
      <p>After giving her the hallucinogenic drug, Broughton chillingly filmed her as she suffered a "gradual demise" over the next six hours.</p>
      <p>Following Broughton's sentencing, Louella's father, John, said: "I wake up every morning to face life starting again without Louella. Our daughter, our sister, our friend, our family now broken.</p>
      <p>“I go to bed every night with the image of Louella crying out to her mum and dad and brother and sister to help.</p>
      <p>“But there was only one person who could have helped her.”</p>
