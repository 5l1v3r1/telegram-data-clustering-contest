      <p>Actress Yoon Ji-oh, who is under investigation for suspected fraud and defamation, lashed out at police for requesting an Interpol Red Notice for the Korean Canadian, despite her alleged crimes not being serious.<br/><br/>“A Red Notice is targeting those who committed heinous crimes such as those who committed economic crimes worth more than 500 million won ($433,000) or organized crimes and I haven’t done anything like that in the first place,” Yoon said on her social media account Thursday.<br/><br/>Yoon, 32, has been staying in Canada since April after several lawsuits were filed against her.<br/><br/>She is accused of damaging the legacy of a late actress Jang Ja-yeon by posing as a key witness to the alleged sex abuse scandal involving Jang and using donations for private purposes.<br/><br/>She said she had seen a suicide note written by Jang that included the names of men who she had been forced to provide sexual services to, and had raised donations.<br/><br/>Jang took her own life in March 2009, leaving a note that accused her agent of forcing her to attend parties and provide sexual favors to high-profile figures in the entertainment and media industries.<br/><br/>Korean police asked Interpol to issue a Red Notice for her as she has repeatedly refused Korean police requests to come back to the country for questioning. Interpol issued the Red Notice on Wednesday.<br/><br/>Police also asked for cooperation from Canadian authorities.</p>
