        <b>A member of Labour's shadow cabinet has denied singing "Hey Jews" to The Beatles' song Hey Jude on a coach trip last year.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Shadow international development secretary Dan Carden was accused of singing an altered version of the song on a journey back from Cheltenham Festival, <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexwickham/labour-dan-carden-hey-jews-hey-jude">BuzzFeed News reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Jeremy Corbyn said: "If it's true, it is utterly and totally unacceptable."</p>
      <p>Mr Carden said he stood by his record as an anti-racist campaigner.</p>
      <p>BuzzFeed News journalist Alex Wickham claimed he was sitting behind Mr Carden on a "private bus" in March 2018, along with other Labour MPs and MPs from other parties.</p>
      <p>He said Mr Carden, who is seeking to be re-elected as MP for Liverpool Walton, "repeatedly sang the chorus of 'Hey Jude', replacing the word 'Jude' with 'Jews'."</p>
      <p>Labour leader Mr Corbyn said he was "looking into" the allegation.</p>
      <h3>'Fighting racism'</h3>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/DanCardenMP/status/1193131776178368513">In a Twitter thread</a>, Mr Carden said: "I have been categorical in my denial about allegations relating to a coach trip some 20 months ago.</p>
      <p>"This was a coach full of journalists and MPs. If anyone genuinely believed any anti-Semitic behaviour had taken place, they would've had a moral responsibility to report it immediately.</p>
      <p>"Yet this allegation is only made now when a general election is imminent.</p>
      <p>"I stand by my record as an anti-racist campaigner. I would never be part of any behaviour that undermines my commitment to fighting racism in all its forms."</p>
      <p>The news website <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexwickham/labour-dan-carden-hey-jews-hey-jude">said it was "choosing to publish" the story now</a> after "fresh anti-Semitism allegations against Labour candidates over the last 48 hours".</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-50338256">A Labour candidate in Aberdeenshire quit on Thursday</a> after the Jewish Chronicle reported that she compared Israel to an abused child who becomes an abusive adult.</p>
      <p>And <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-50344324">another Labour candidate pulled out of the election race</a> on Friday over the use of an anti-Semitic remark.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, the Labour leader <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-50339517/anti-semitism-is-a-poison-and-an-evil-jeremy-corbyn">told the BBC</a> "anti-Semitism is a poison and an evil" and insisted his party had confronted anti-Semitism and taken action.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn said members had been suspended or expelled and an education programme had been set up.</p>
