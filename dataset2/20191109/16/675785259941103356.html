      <h1>Dimitar Berbatov makes Liverpool vs Man City prediction ahead of Premier League showdown</h1>
      <h2>Liverpool take on Manchester City in a crunch Premier League clash at Anfield</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T16:43:34+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 16:43</time> by <a rel="author">Jacob Murtagh, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jacob-murtagh/</a></address>
      <p>Manchester City have been backed to beat Liverpool on Sunday and blow the title race wide open.</p>
      <p>The Reds lead City by six points and can put daylight between the sides with victory at Anfield in the top of the table clash.</p>
      <p>However, former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> striker Dimitar Berbatov believes Pep Guardiola's side will run out 2-1 winners and cut Liverpool's lead in half.</p>
      <p>Betfair ambassador Berbatov told the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/08/dimitar-berbatovs-premier-league-predictions-including-arsenal-chelsea-liverpool-man-utd-11068311">Metro</a> : "Whoever plays in goal for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> won’t be too much of a concern for Pep Guardiola, as he has faith in Ederson’s understudy Claudio Bravo.</p>
      <p>"The City manager will be aiming to come away from Anfield with three points on Sunday.</p>
      <p>"It will be tight, and the first half could be a tactical chess match, but I’m backing City to nick this one and blow the title race wide open."</p>

      <p>Claudio Bravo will make his first Premier League appearance in 18 months in the white heat of a title tussle with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> , but Guardiola has full faith in his replacement goalkeeper.</p>
      <p>Regular number one Ederson has been ruled out after coming off at half-time in the midweek draw in Atalanta, a game that ended with Kyle Walker donning the gloves after substitute Bravo was sent off for a rash challenge.</p>
      <p>That was hardly the confidence-boosting cameo the former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> man would have wanted, but he now faces the prospect of facing the table-topping Reds having last started a league game on the final day of the 2017/18 campaign.</p>

      <p>There is no doubt Ederson's absence represents a further blow to a City side who sit six points adrift of their rivals and have won at Anfield only once since 1981, but Guardiola did not miss a beat as he offered Bravo his complete confidence.</p>
      <p>"He (Ederson) is not able to play. But we have another top keeper," he said.</p>
      <p>"We won the Carabao Cup (in 2018) thanks to Claudio, so he's an exceptional keeper. He's won a lot of games with his national team, Chile. So, no doubts."</p>
