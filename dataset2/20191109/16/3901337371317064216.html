        <b>English Premier League</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Result:</b> Chelsea 2-0 Crystal Palace</p>
      <p><b>Date:</b> 09 November 2019</p>
      <p><b>Venue:</b> Stamford Bridge</p>
      <p>Tammy Abraham bagged his 10th Premier League goal of the season as Chelsea claimed a 2-0 win over Crystal Palace on Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Jorginho missed out for the home side, although there was a return for star midfielder N'Golo Kante for Frank Lampard's side. Meanwhile, Gary Cahill lined up for Palace against his former side.</p>
      <p>The Blues dominated from the onset in front of their roaring supporters but they were unable to make their early dominance count as the likes of Christian Pulisic and Willian had chances in the opening 15 minutes.</p>
      <p>Palace, meanwhile, were quite happy to sit back and soak up the pressure, although they never really threatened the home side on the counter-attack.</p>
      <p>That was the trend for the remainder of the first half as the Blues failed to trouble Palace goalkeeper Guaita for the rest of the stanza as chances were hard to come by.</p>
      <p>Seven minutes into the though, the home side were ahead as Abraham bagged his 10th goal of the Premier League season after turning home a cross from Willian.</p>
      <p>The Blues nearly extended their lead on the hour mark but Guaita was on hand to brilliantly keep out Pulisic' effort from distance as the Blues upped the tempo.</p>
      <p>Pulisic would not be denied with 12 minutes as the United States internatioal sealed three points the Blues' after nodding home a deflcted strike from Michy Batshuayi for his first goal at Stamford Bridge.</p>
