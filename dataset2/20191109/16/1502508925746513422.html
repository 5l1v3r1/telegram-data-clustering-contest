      <h1>Another sign of economic slowdown: India's power need shrinks for 3rd month</h1>
      <h2>The slump began in August when the power requirement dropped for the first time in more than two years</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T16:07:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 16:07</time> by <a rel="author">Bloomberg</a></address>
      <p>India’s electricity demand declined for the third straight month, another indication of an <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/economic-slowdown">economic slowdown </a>that seems to be deepening.</p>
      <p>Electricity demand from distribution utilities declined 13.2 per cent in October from a year earlier, data from the Central Electricity Authority showed. The slump began in August when the power requirement dropped for the first time in more than two years.</p>
      <p>Slowing requirement mirrors a widespread slump in demand for consumers goods to cars and houses. Industrialised provinces of Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu — both automobile hubs of the country — and Gujarat, a centre of textiles and chemicals manufacturing, have also reported a sharp decline in demand.</p>
      <p>“The slowdown in industrial activity is responsible for this sharp contraction,” said Debasish Mishra, a partner at Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu in Mumbai. “The extended monsoon has also reduced demand for cooling during the summers and irrigation demand from farmers.”</p>
      <p>The data comes on the back of Moody’s Investors Service cutting India’s credit rating outlook to negative, citing a slowing economy, credit crunch and rising public debt.</p>
