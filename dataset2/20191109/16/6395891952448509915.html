      <p><b>PARISÂ (AP)</b> - So this is what freedom tastes like.</p>
      <p>A French chocolate sculptor celebrated the 30th anniversary Saturday of the opening of the Berlin Wall by taking a hammer to a chocolate replica of the infamous barrier, distributing the sweet chunks to applauding bystanders.</p>
      <p>Patrick Roger said it felt "amazing to share the taste, the values and a certain wind of liberty."</p>
      <p>Just as Berliners smashed chunks out of the concrete wall, Roger and an assistant attacked the replica with gusto. They quickly smashed a hole with their hammers and grasped an outstretched hand poked through it by someone on the other side.</p>
      <p>Made with 200 kilos (440 pounds) of chocolate, the wall scrawled with the words "freedom" and, in German, "I am a Berliner!" was then brought crashing down onto the pavement in front of Roger's chocolate store in Paris, shattering into hundreds of pieces.</p>
      <p>Delighted bystanders gnawed on the chunks and carried away bags-full.</p>
      <p>"It's amazing, 200 kilos of chocolate gone in a few minutes," Roger said.</p>
      <p>The Parisians and tourists who came to watch the tasty spectacle included Cecile Reveret, who lived for a few years in East Germany before the wall's collapse, which was a pivotal moment in the fall of Communism in eastern Europe.</p>
      <p>"It is a magnificent idea. That's why I came. I have pieces of the wall now," Reveret said. "I wasn't there for the fall in 1989. But I was with all my heart supporting the reunification and these Eastern Germans that I had the chance to mix with, and who had tears in their eyes sometimes when they mentioned the wall."</p>
