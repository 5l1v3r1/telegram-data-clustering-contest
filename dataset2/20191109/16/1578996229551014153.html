      <p>Jennifer Lopez is never <i>not </i>busy. The actress is currently shooting her upcoming romantic comedy <i>Marry Me</i>, and was photographed at JFK airport in New York looking stunning in a tight sequined red dress. The film marks a return to romantic comedies for Lopez, who recently received critical acclaim for her role in her summer blockbuster <i>Hustlers</i>.</p>
      <p>2019 has been a big year for Lopez, who also went on tour to celebrate her 50th birthday in addition to getting engaged to boyfriend Alex Rodriguez this spring. She’ll start 2020 off with a bang, too, with a headlining Super Bowl halftime show alongside Shakira. Rodriguez recently opened up about Lopez’s reaction to getting the Super Bowl offer, saying she was brought to tears.</p>
      <p>“She's been rehearsing for, like, six weeks,” <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1090132/jennifer-lopez-was-in-tears-after-scoring-the-2020-super-bowl-halftime-show">he said</a> during an appearance on the <i>Today</i> show. “When we got that call from [NFL commissioner] Roger Goodell and the league and Jay Z, we were thrilled and she was in tears.”</p>
      <p>Lopez released a statement of her own after the announcement was made, saying she’s dreamed of having her own Super Bowl halftime show for decades.</p>
      <p>“Ever since I saw Diana Ross fly off into the sky at the Halftime Show, I dreamed of performing at the Super Bowl,” she said. “And now it's made even more special not only because it's the NFL’s 100th anniversary, but also because I am performing with a fellow Latina. I can’t wait to show what us girls can do on the world’s biggest stage.”</p>
