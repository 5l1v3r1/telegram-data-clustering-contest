      <p>Two Scots are feared to have the potentially-deadly diphtheria infection.</p>
      <p>NHS Lothian chiefs said the two cases are related and that both patients had recently returned from abroad.</p>
      <p>People who have been in close contact with the patients have been notified. According to the NHS, diphtheria is a highly contagious infection which can be passed through coughing or sneezing or through close contact with someone who is infected.</p>
      <p>The health board added that the likelihood of additional cases was small, as most people are immunised against diphtheria at a young age.</p>
      <p>The potentially fatal infection can affect the nose and throat as well as the skin. It is believed the pair are currently receiving treatment at a hospital in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/edinburgh">Edinburgh.</a></p>
      <p>Symptoms include a thick grey-white coating at the back of the throat, a fever, difficulty breathing or swallowing and blisters and ulcers on legs, feet and hands if it affects the skin.</p>
      <p>Alison McCallum, Director of Public Health and Health Policy, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/nhs-scotland">NHS</a> Lothian said: "Two related cases of diphtheria have been confirmed in the Lothian area, with both patients having recently returned from abroad.</p>
      <p>"All close contacts of these patients have been identified, contacted and followed up in line with nationally agreed guidelines.</p>
      <p>"The likelihood of any additional cases is very small, as most people are protected by immunisation given in childhood. In Lothian 98% of children are vaccinated against diphtheria by the age of 24 months.</p>
      <p>"We encourage people travelling abroad to visit Fit for Travel where they can access information on how to stay safe and healthy abroad, as well as destination specific health advice."</p>
