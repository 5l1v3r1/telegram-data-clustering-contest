      <h1>Kilmarnock 2, Hamilton 2: Red card costs Accies dearly as Killie fight back</h1>
      <h2>Hamilton were cruising until Sam Stubbs was sent off, with Killie scoring ether sde of the interval.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T16:51:37+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 16:51</time> by <a rel="author">Andy McGilvray, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/andy-mcgilvray/</a></address>
      <p>Ten-man Hamilton Accies threw away a two-goal lead at Kilmarnock, as Sam Stubbs' first-half red card came back to bite them.</p>
      <p>Accies were seemigly heading for their first win in six games as goals from Mickel Miller and Steven Davies had them 2-0 up inside 25 minutes.</p>
      <p>But Stubbs' dismissal four minutes later for a foul on Eamonn Brophy cost them two precious points.</p>
      <p>Under those circumstances, Accies migtt be happier with the point.</p>
      <p>Angelo Alessio was Premiership Manager of the Month for October andÂ  it didn't look good for him when Hamilton went 2-0 up eary on, but they pulled a goal back through Mohammed El Makrini inside first-half stoppage time.</p>
      <p>In the second half Brophy drew Kilmarnock level with a thunderous shot.</p>
      <p>Alessio made three changes to the side that lost heavily in Aberdeen last week, with Dario Del Fabro, Alex Bruce and Mohammed El Makrini in for Iain Wilson, Liam Millar and Chris Burke.</p>
      <p>Hamilton head coach Brian Rice made two changes to the side that drew with Ross County last week, with Johnny Hunt and Steven Davies in for suspended Scott Martin and Ross Cunningham.</p>
      <p>Accies took the lead inside three minutes when Alex Gogic's chip forward was knocked down to Mickel Miller and he drove it into the bottom left corner.</p>

      <p>Killie tried to hit back and a good move down the right ended in Eamonn Brophy being sent through on goal in 15 minutes, in nine minutes but a last-gasp tackle by Gogic cleared for a corner, which ultimately came to nothing.</p>
      <p>A minute later, Brophy danced past Jamie Hamilton on the left, turned, but curled a shot just over.</p>
      <p>Hamilton doubled their lead in 25 minutes when Gogc's high ball was knocked down by George Oakley and Davies struck it sweetly into the right corner.</p>
      <p>The game then changed in 29 minutes when Sam Stubbs was judged to have hauled Brophy back 35 yards from goal, with referee Gavin Duncan deeming it a clear goal-scoring opportunity.</p>

      <p>Goal-scorer Davies was then withdrawn for Darian MacKinnon as Rice tried to shore up his side.</p>
      <p>Killie tried to take advantage and in 35 minutes a sweeping move had Brophy through in the centre, but his shot was well taken by Owain Fon Wis.</p>
      <p>The hosts did pull a goal back inside stoppage time when El Makrini hit a hopeful shot from 30 yards and it hit Fon Williams before bouncing over him and into the net.</p>

      <p>Killie levelled four minutes into the second half when Rory McKenzie's corner on the right was knocked out to Brophy, who smashed a shot into the roof of the net.</p>
      <p>Hamilton tried to regain their lead and in 53 minutes Hunt's corner from the left was headed just over by Jamie Hamilton.</p>
      <p>Kilmarnock went close to taking the lead in 65 minutes when Alan Power's cutback from the right was stabbed, angled, past the right post by Gary Dicker, while Fon Williams could only watch.</p>
      <p>Brophy tried again in 68 minutes but Fon Williams blocked his shot, before the flag went up.</p>
      <p>Killie went for it seconds after that, bringing on the experienced Chris Burke for Dom Thomas.</p>
      <p>it nearly paid dividends in 75 minutes when, from another good move, McKenzie's close-range volley was well saved by Fon Williams.</p>
