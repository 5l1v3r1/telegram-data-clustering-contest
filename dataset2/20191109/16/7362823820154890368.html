      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-jersey">New Jersey</a> man was charged Friday after an autopsy report revealed that the two people found dead in a house fire earlier this week appeared to have sustained “stab wounds.”</p>
      <p>Jaree D. Kitchen, 21, was charged with murder and aggravated arson after <a href="http://www.middlesexcountynj.gov/Government/Departments/PSH/Prosecutor/News/Pages/11-08-19.aspx">prosecutors</a> say he started the fire at his father’s home on Sheridan Street in Jamesburg, a borough 40 miles south of Newark, on Wednesday. His dad, Clifford Kitchen, 53, and a second unidentified person were found dead inside the home.</p>

      <p>But according to Middlesex County Acting Prosecutor Christie L. Bevacqua, an autopsy report conducted by the medical examiner’s office revealed that the two victims appeared to have “sustained stab wounds.”</p>
      <p>Officials announced Friday that the deaths had been ruled a homicide. It was not immediately clear if they died as a result of the stabbing or the fire.</p>
      <p>Kitchen was taken into custody Wednesday and now faces a myriad of charges including two counts of first-degree murder, aggravated arson in the second degree, hindering his own prosecution, possession of a weapon for unlawful purpose and destroying evidence.</p>
