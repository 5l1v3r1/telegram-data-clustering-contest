      <p>Barcelona face a lot of competition in the battle to sign Bayer Leverkusen's Kai Havertz, who they watched play in the German side's win over Atletico Madrid in midweek.</p>
      <p>Bar√ßa have tracked the attacking midfielder for a long time but they are not the only side. His performances last season have carried on into the new campaign and he's attracting a lot of interest.</p>
      <p>In England, there are reports that Juventus are also keen on the German international, while Manchester United are also fans of the player valued at around 100 million euros.</p>
      <p>Bayern Munich and Real Madrid should not be forgotten, either. Both have been monitoring Havertz and Madrid midfielder Toni Kroos has spoken with him personally.</p>
