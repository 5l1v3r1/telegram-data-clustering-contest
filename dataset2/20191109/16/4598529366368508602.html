      <p>Navy Rear Adm. Ronny Jackson, President Donald Trump’s onetime VA nominee who was sunk amid <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/summary-details-ronny-jackson-allegations-about-drinking-and-dangerous-prescriptions">allegations</a> of workplace drunkenness and overprescription, is considering a run for Texas Congress.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.rollcall.com/news/campaigns/former-va-nominee-ronny-jackson-eyes-run-for-congress/">According to Roll Call,</a> he’s considering a run in Texas’ 13th district, a safe Republican seat, after the incumbent retired.</p>
      <p>Jackson, who won Trump’s adoration after he gave a dubiously glowing public report of the President’s health when he was his chief physician, still works at the White House.</p>
      <p>Jackson also served as a physician to Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush.</p>
