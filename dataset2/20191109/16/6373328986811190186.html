      <p>Benjamin Schreiber, 66, was sentenced to life without parole for bludgeoning a man to death in 1996, after which he was taken to Iowa State Penitentiary in Fort Madison.</p>
      <p>Theoretically, a <a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/news/convicted-rapist-with-three-life-sentences-accidentally-freed-from-prison-early/">life sentence</a> would mean the convict remained in prison until he died, however this definition would pose a problem should they come back to life.</p>

      <p>It’s not the first time someone has claimed to have been revived from death. And Schreiber claims it’s exactly what happened to him.</p>
      <p>The 66-year-old developed septic poisoning as a result of kidney stones in 2015 and he was taken from prison to hospital. According to <i><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Weird/wireStory/iowa-inmates-claim-briefly-died-end-life-sentence-66849331">ABC News</a></i>, Schreiber says his heart stopped five times, meaning doctors had to fight to bring him back to life.</p>
      <p>The convicted killer made a full recovery and went back to prison, though upon returning it seems he spent his time searching for loopholes in his case, as last year he filed a claim to say his life sentence should be over.</p>

      <p>In the claim, Schreiber said he had been resuscitated against his will and that his brief ‘death’ meant his life sentence had technically ended, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-50355168"><i>BBC News</i></a> reports.</p>

      <p>A district judge reportedly found little merit in Schreiber’s argument, saying the fact he’d filed the claim was evidence enough to prove he was still among the living.</p>
      <p>They admitted the argument was original, but described it as ‘unpersuasive’ and in turn decided to rule against the claim.</p>
      <p>Schreiber’s lawyer didn’t give up though, as they took the case to the state’s court of appeal in a further attempt to free the killer. However, on Wednesday, November 6, the appeals court upheld the lower court’s ruling.</p>

        <b>Judge Amanda Potterfield said:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>Schreiber is either alive, in which case he must remain in prison, or he is dead, in which case this appeal is moot.</blockquote>
      <p>The appeals court also cleared up any grey area surrounding the definition of a ‘life sentence’ by pointing out the end of the sentence would go hand in hand with the end of Schreiber’s life – not a brief experience of death. The killer’s sentence will therefore come to an end when a medical examiner formally declares him dead.</p>
      <p>It was an innovative effort, but Schreiber will just have to accept he’s behind bars for good.</p>
