      <h1>'I'm thinking about it': Trump considering invitation from Putin to attend Russian parade</h1>

      <p>President Trump said he is weighing whether to visit Russia next year and attend its Victory Day parade.</p>
      <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin invited Trump in June to attend the country’s annual Victory Day events. Victory Day comes on May 9 and commemorates the 1945 victory over Nazi Germany.</p>
      <p>“I was invited. I am thinking about it. It is right in the middle of our campaign season,” Trump <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/469591-trump-says-hes-considering-attending-russias-may-day-parade">said</a> Friday.</p>
      <p>“It’s a very big deal, celebrating the end of the war,” he added. “I appreciate the invitation, it’s right in the middle of the political season.”</p>
      <p>Russia uses the parade to show off its military might, including displays of missiles, tanks, and marching troops.</p>
      <p>Trump’s appearance at the parade would not be unprecedented. Two U.S. presidents have attended the event: Bill Clinton in 1995 and George W. Bush in 2005.</p>
