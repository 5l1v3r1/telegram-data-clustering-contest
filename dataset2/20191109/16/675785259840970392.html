      <h1>KSI vs Logan Paul front row celebrities confirmed for eagerly-awaited rematch</h1>
      <h2>KSI will face off against Paul in a professional boxing rematch on Saturday at The Staples Centre in Los Angeles after their major amateur bout at the Manchester Arena last year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T16:08:22+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 16:08</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>There will be a star-studded list of celebrities attending the highly-anticipated boxing rematch between YouTube stars KSI and Logan Paul on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>KSI will face off against Paul in a professional boxing rematch at The Staples Centre in Los Angeles after their major amateur bout at the Manchester Arena last year.</p>
      <p>The white-collar event sold out to 20,000 fans and drew an audience of 2.5 million live viewers and more than 19 million subsequent views, making it the biggest internet event in history.</p>
      <p>However viewers were left dissatisfied with the outcome of the fight as it ended in a majority draw, and the pair will hope to put on a better show when they go toe-to-toe in the States.</p>

      <p>And among those who will be present is American pop star <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/justin-bieber">Justin Bieber</a> , who is believed to be a guest of Paul, and US rapper Wiz Khalifa.</p>
      <p>American rappers Rick Ross and Lil Baby - who both feature on KSI's new single Down Like That - will also be among the familiar faces who will be ring side on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Other stars who will be sitting on the front rows are Dan Bilzerian, the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> influencer, and Paul's brother Jake, who is also a YouTube personality.</p>
      <p>Last month, Paul said he expects Bieber to be ringside for his rematch with KSI - but won't let his friends ask for photos.</p>

      <p>Paul said: "We're trying to get as [many] of our influencer friends into the fight as possible but apparently there's like a ticket situation.</p>
      <p>"There's going to be some big celebrities coming, I think Bieber is coming. I'm gonna place him next to my mother and father."</p>
      <p>Paul went on to warn his fans not to bother the superstar singer.</p>
      <p>He added: "If anyone in my family and friends section asks Bieber for a picture, I am kicking you the f*** out. Just leave the kid alone. I just want to promise him sanctity and safety and entertainment."</p>
