      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T16:51:42+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 16:51</time> by <a rel="author">Courtney Pochin, https://www.facebook.com/courtneypochinmirror/?modal=admin_todo_tour</a></address>
      <p>When you have a little one around the house, it can be difficult to keep the place clean.</p>
      <p>But one <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/parenting">mum</a> has come up with a quick and simple way to ensure her carpets don't get any dirtier than they have to.</p>
      <p>And she's been praised for her "brilliant" idea after sharing it in a post on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a>.</p>
      <p>The clever woman revealed how in wet, wintry weather she pops shower caps from Poundland over the wheels of her pram to stop it tracking unwanted dirt all over her floor.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Writing on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/ExtremeCouponingAndBargainsUK/">Extreme Couponing and Baragains UK group,</a> she explained: "£1 shower caps bought from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/poundland">Poundland.</a></p>
      <p>"Ideal for popping over your muddy wheels to catch the mud when it dries and flakes off.</p>
      <p>"Saves your carpets and floors getting dirty."</p>
      <p>She added that you can buy proper wheel covers for push chairs, but that she thinks the £1 shower caps are a better "money saving idea" and they "work so well".</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Alongside this she uploaded a snap of her buggy, with Disney's Little Mermaid shower caps on the wheels.</p>
      <p>Her carpet underneath was spotless.</p>
      <p>Almost 6,000 people liked her post, praising her for sharing the idea.</p>
      <p>One person wrote: "Now this IS a hack! Awesome idea."</p>
      <p>"Bloody ingenious idea there," commented another.</p>
      <p>A third added: "Brilliant idea! Thanks for sharing."</p>
      <p>Someone else proclaimed: "If only I knew this 18 years ago. Genius."</p>
