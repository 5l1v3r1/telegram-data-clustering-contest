      <h1>President Trump Says He Is Weighing Putin's Invitation to Russia Victory Day Parade</h1>

      <p>(WASHINGTON) — President Donald Trump says he’s weighing an invitation from Russian President Vladimir Putin to attend the May 9 Victory Day parade in Moscow.</p>
      <p>Trump tells reporters he appreciates the invitation from Putin, but the parade falls “right in the middle of political season,” so he’s not sure he can make it.</p>
      <p>He adds: “I would love to go if I could.”</p>
      <p>The event commemorates the May 1945 allied victory over Nazi Germany. Russia uses the annual parade to show off its military might.</p>
      <p>Trump says the event, which next year marks the 75th anniversary of the allied victory, is “a very big deal.”</p>
