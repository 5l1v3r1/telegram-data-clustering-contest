      <h1>Popeyes violence continues after woman is body-slammed outside Tennessee restaurant</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T16:50:55+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 16:50</time> by <a rel="author">Gerren Keith Gaynor</a></address>
      <p>A viral video of a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/popeyes-chicken-sandwich-woman-scraping-car">Popeyes</a> employee body-slamming a woman outside a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/tennessee">Tennessee </a>restaurant has resulted in an arrest on Friday.</p>
      <p>Deriance Ra’Shaiel Hughes, 29, was charged with felony aggravated assault for the incident that stemmed from an altercation between the woman and employees inside the fast-food location.<br/><br/>A lawyer representing the victim, Debra Staggs, 55, said she was trying to get a refund after reportedly being double-charged for food, reports local TV station <a href="https://www.wsmv.com/news/tensions-running-high-after-body-slamming-incident-at-columbia-popeye/article_375d9e22-028a-11ea-a5aa-b78b6b080c3e.html">WSMV</a>.</p>
      <p>Things quickly escalated, however, as Staggs and Hughes got into an argument at the cashier counter. In a video posted on Twitter, Hughes is seen slamming Staggs to the ground outside. </p>

      <p>There are conflicting accounts about what transpired before the violent attack. In another video that captured the argument inside the restaurant, employees accused Staggs of using the N-word and asked her repeatedly to leave.</p>

      <p>Staggs’ lawyers said their client denies using the racial slur and that the store’s manager “immediately began insulting her” when she returned to request a refund after checking her bank statement.</p>

      <p>Jeff Janssen, a Popeyes employee, told WSMV that Hughes was fired after the incident. “It was uncalled for. Wasn’t no reason for that,” he said.</p>
      <p>A Popeyes spokesperson said in a <a href="https://fox17.com/news/local/columbia-police-investigating-video-showing-woman-being-body-slammed-outside-popeyes">statement </a>to a Fox affiliate that the company was “shocked” over the attack.</p>

      <p>“The entire circumstance is highly unfortunate for all involved, and we hope to never see this type of behavior again."<br/><br/>The altercation in Tennessee comes after a string of violent incidents at other Popeyes restaurants around the country, some of which have been tied to the fast-food restaurant's popular chicken sandwich.<br/><br/>Trays were sent <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/popeyes-fight-trays-viral-video">flying </a>at a Popeyes restaurant in San Antonio on Tuesday during a fight between a customer and an employee. The two unidentified women were seen throwing food trays at each other in a dispute caught on video and posted on Twitter.<br/><br/>In a separate <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/popeyes-fight-maryland">altercation </a>caught on camera in Maryland, a Popeyes employee and male customer were seen brawling behind the counter as customers and other employees look on. Investigators confirmed that the incident was sparked by a confrontation between a customer and an employee after the customer demanded a refund.<br/><br/>In another incident on Sunday, a man was <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/28-year-old-man-fatally-stabbed-at-maryland-popeyes-after-fight-over-chicken-sandwich-police-confirm">stabbed to death</a> outside a different Maryland Popeyes.
