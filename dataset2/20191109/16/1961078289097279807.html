      <p>One of the people, Jordyn Jones, 21, who has been described by the police as Ms. Crawford’s roommate and friend, was booked on a charge of malice murder on Saturday, the police said.</p>
      <p>Barron Brantley, described by the police as Ms. Jones’s boyfriend, was taken into custody on Friday and also charged with malice murder, a spokeswoman for the Atlanta Police Department said on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Mr. Brantley, 21, also faced charges of hindering a person making an emergency telephone call and three probation violations, including battery, cruelty to children in the third degree and theft by taking, Fulton County inmate records show.</p>
      <p>The medical examiner determined the cause of Ms. Crawford’s death on Oct. 31 was asphyxiation, the police said on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The developments came after Chief Erika Shields of the Atlanta Police Department said at <a href="https://twitter.com/Atlanta_Police/status/1192932790242861057">a news conference</a> on Friday that Ms. Crawford’s “case has come to one of the saddest conclusions possible, and has been absolutely heartbreaking.”</p>
      <p>“To Alexis’s family, our hearts go out to you,” she said. “I am so truly sorry that we could not provide you with a better ending.”</p>
      <p>Chief Shields said one of the suspects led investigators to the location of the body but it was not immediately clear who it was or where in the park Ms. Crawford was found.</p>
      <p>While a motive was not yet clear, the police did take a report from Ms. Crawford on Oct. 27, just days before she was reported missing.</p>
      <p>“In this report, Alexis described unwanted kissing and touching from Barron Brantley,” Chief Shields said.</p>
      <p>The report also named Ms. Jones as a witness.</p>
      <p>Ms. Crawford was taken to a hospital for a rape kit to be administered, and a clothing item and bedding were recovered from the scene, the report said.</p>
      <p>Late on Nov. 1, Ms. Crawford was reported missing by her mother and two sisters, who all said they last communicated with her on Oct. 30.</p>
      <p>While being interviewed by investigators, Ms. Jones had said she was not on speaking terms with Ms. Crawford because of a separate unspecified incident, the report said.</p>
      <p>Ms. Jones told investigators that she had taken Ms. Crawford to a store where Ms. Crawford bought a bottle of alcohol and later returned home. They last saw each other at approximately 12:30 a.m. before Ms. Jones went to her bedroom for the night, the report said.</p>
      <p>“Ms. Jones stated that Ms. Alexis Crawford wasn’t in the residence the following morning when Ms. Jones left for class the next morning,” the report said.</p>
      <p>Investigators have determined that this was an “isolated, off-campus incident,” George T. French Jr., the president of Clark Atlanta University, <a href="https://twitter.com/CAU/status/1192938323968438272/photo/1">said in a statement</a> on Friday.</p>
      <p>“Our deepest thoughts and prayers are with her family and with everyone who knew and loved Alexis,” he said.</p>
