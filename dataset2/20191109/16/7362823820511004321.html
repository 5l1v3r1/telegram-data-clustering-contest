      <h1>Australia wildfire victim's frantic last words to daughter-in-law: 'We're on fire!'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T16:48:09+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 16:48</time> by <a rel="author">David Aaro</a></address>
      <p>Wildfires have ripped through <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/australia">Australia's</a> most populated state, claiming three lives, destroying at least 150 homes and forcing more than 1,300 people to flee, according to officials.</p>
      <p>Over 35 people have been injured, including 16 of the 1,500 firefighters <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/disasters/fires">battling fires</a> across New South Wales.</p>
      <p>Vivian Chaplain, 69, one of the three killed as more than 81 blazes continued to scar the area Saturday afternoon, spoke to her daughter-in-law as flames surrounded her home, according to <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/australian-bushfires-hundreds-of-koalas-killed-as-record-number-of-blazes-rage-11857727">Sky News</a>.</p>

      <p>"I was the last one to speak to her. She was in absolute panic," Chrystal Harwood said. "'We're on fire! There's fire everywhere!'"</p>
      <p>"Before I even got to tell her to just get out, she'd hung up on me. I couldn't get back through to her. I tried so many times," Harwood said. "She was amazing. She was such a strong, loving woman."</p>
      <p>Harwood used social media to make an urgent plea for a rescue on Friday.</p>
      <p>"Viv is alone can someone help, anyone, please ...," Harwood posted. "'The RFS can't get to her they are trying...the road down is a tunnel of fire."</p>
      <p>The Rural Fire Service said Chaplain died in the hospital after authorities found her unconscious with severe burns near Glen Innes, according to T<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2019/nov/09/nsw-and-queensland-fires-more-than-100-homes-destroyed-and-three-people-missing-live">he Guardian</a>.</p>

      <p>"The reports were initially burns to 40 to 50 percent of her body," RFS Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-09/nsw-fires-emergency-day-leads-to-injury-and-damage-assessment/11688620">abc.net.au</a>.</p>
      <p>Firefighters found another body Saturday morning in a burned car near Glenn Innes -- a victim of the same fire that killed Chaplain.</p>

      <p>New South Wales police said another unidentified body was found in a burned-out building at Johns River. An autopsy will determine whether the victim is the 63-year-old woman who owns the house.</p>
      <p>Only one fire remained at the emergency-warning level in New South Wales on Saturday afternoon. On Friday, 17 fires were given that status.</p>
      <p>But Fitzsimmons warned people to brace themselves for more trouble, with hot and windy conditions expected to return Tuesday, making firefighting difficult.</p>

      <p>“We are expecting widespread, severe, extreme fire danger ratings,” Fitzsimmons said.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison warned Australians to expect more bad news from the fire zones.</p>
      <p>"The devastating and horrific fires that we have seen, particularly in New South Wales but also in Queensland, have been absolutely chilling," Morrison said.</p>
