      <h1>'Booted out' - We predict the result of Wolves vs Aston Villa</h1>
      <h2>Wolverhampton Wanderers vs Aston Villa | BirminghamLive's football desk give their predictions ahead of this weekend's West Midlands derby</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T20:08:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 20:08</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Dicken, https://www.facebook.com/alexdickenjournalist/?fref=ts</a></address>
      <p>Wolverhampton Wanderers and <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> meet in the Premier League this weekend for the first time since 2012.</p>
      <p>Nuno Espirito Santo's <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> and Dean Smith's Villa face off at Molineux on Sunday for the second time in two weeks. While the Carabao Cup meeting last week saw both managers field weakened teams, Wolves and Villa will be at full strength this time around.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the West Midlands derby our football desk of Alex Dicken (AD), Ashley Preece (AP), Ben Husband (BH), Joe Chapman (JC), Mat Kendrick (MK) and Steve Wollaston (SW) have given their predictions.</p>

      <h3>What have you made of both Wolves and Villa so far this season?</h3>
      <p><b>AD:</b> Watching Wolves has been frustrating at times because it's clear they're in a false position in the Premier League. The Europa League form has been exceptional and I wouldn't bet against Wolves, playing Nuno's style of counter-attacking football, progressing very far. Wolves have only lost four times in 23 matches this season - but there have been too many draws in the league.</p>
      <p>I've not seen a great deal of Villa but, from what I have watched, I think they look a useful side. I think goals may become an issue long-term with £22m record buy Wesley needing time to adapt, but they have the makings of a steady Premier League side.</p>
      <p><b>AP:</b> Very good. Both sides are on the up and the feel-good factor remains in full flow among both sets of supporters, despite respective 12th and 16th positions in the Premier League table. For Wolves' Europa League exploits, Villa have the Carabao Cup quarter-final to look forward to.</p>
      <p>A mention must go to both managers, too, who continue to stick to their guns tactically regardless of the opposition in front of them, with Wolves peppering 25 shots on Arsenal's goal last weekend while Smith's Villa ran title-chasing Liverpool oh so close and had chances to win it. As for both teams, Villa and Wolves can be more than pleased with the start they've made.</p>
      <p>The signs are there for all to see; there's come really classy players in Old Gold and claret and blue and supporters are loving it, such are the sell-out crowds at Molineux and Villa Park.</p>

      <p><b>BH:</b> Wolves have juggled the hectic Europa schedule well. It has felt a little underwhelming at times with the number of draws, but a quick glance at both the Premier League table and likely Europa League progression and it's fair to say it has been a good start.</p>
      <p>When I have seen Villa they have looked bold and willing to go forward, but very naive. A more seasoned team would be sat on a much higher points tally and wouldn't have thrown away several results in the closing stages.</p>
      <p><b>JC:</b> Couldn't have expected much more from Wolves, considering their European commitments. Had they not been in the Europa League this season, I've no doubt they'd be half a dozen places higher up the league ladder.</p>
      <p>As for Villa, it was always going to take a few months to really bed in the glut of new arrivals, but they've shown that they can compete. They certainly need to start playing for 90 minutes, though - the late goals they've conceded is of great concern.</p>
      <p><b>MK:</b> There's not been much to choose between them, in fairness, as the Premier League table suggests. They have both been competitive every week, against the top flight's top clubs and against the lesser lights.</p>
      <p>The difference against the big boys is that Wolves have exerted enough control to get the results (winning at Man City and drawing at Arsenal), while Villa have blown leads against Tottenham, Arsenal and Liverpool. You do worry about the depth of both squads if injuries or suspensions hit, as they go marching on in the Europa League and Carabao Cup respectively.</p>

      <p><b>SW:</b> Wolves need to realise that that they can start playing in the first half and not just the second. Nuno's tactics have to be questioned slightly for me. The persistent approach to trying to win games with a solid defensive, counter-attacking style, isn't as effective as it once was. Too many times this season Wolves have had no Plan B.</p>
      <p>There are no panic stations, but it is OK to suggest Nuno isn't the new Messiah. He needs to be more flexible if Wolves are to kick on in the league. Villa have been unlucky so far and not got the points they arguably should have done. Who cares about a hard luck story though? This is the Premier League and you make your own luck. They won't go down, Villa, but they need a mobile striker in January.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>What do you think the key battle will be on Sunday?</h3>
      <p><b>AD:</b> The midfield battle intrigues me. Villa will pack the midfield with three players and possibly have another in Jack Grealish drifting inside from the left. That would pose Wolves problems with Nuno currently operating with just two middle men - Ruben Neves and Joao Moutinho.</p>
      <p>But I actually think the game will be decided out wide. Villa left-back Matt Targett could come up against Matt Doherty and Adama Traore and the job he does in limiting their threat could go a long way to deciding the match.</p>
      <p><b>AP:</b> The engine room. Wolves are likely to go with their usual suspects of Neves and Moutinho and, with Villa playing three in there, they could overrun the Portuguese pairing. Nuno's side are devastating on the flanks and Villa must be wary of the likes of Adama and Diogo Jota so, with that in mind, I see Smith targeting dominance in the middle of the park and could yet bring Jack Grealish back in to play alongside John McGinn and Marvelous Nakamba.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article16929705.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-1175108542.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p><b>BH:</b> Wolves are likely to move the effective Leander Dendoncker back to centre back, meaning Joao Moutinho and Ruben Neves will be trusted to use the ball well whilst also nullifying John McGinn's impact on proceedings.</p>
      <p><b>JC:</b> In the Wolves final third. Jimenez's physical presence and Jota's technique and tenacity versus Mings and Engels. It'll be all about how the defensive Villa pair deal with them.</p>
      <p><b>MK:</b> In the stands, if Villa can get at Wolves and quieten the Molineux masses. During Aston Villa v Wolverhampton Wanderers Lite last month, Wolves' 5,000 following rattled through their repertoire of Villa songs in the early stages.</p>
      <p>With the exception of a few flares and some half hearted singing from both fanbases, it all fell a little bit flat though as Dean Smith's reserves dominated and defeated Nuno Espirito Santo's under-13s.  Villa will take 3,000 fans to Molineux so will be outnumbered in a 30,000 sell out crowd.</p>
      <p>How Smith's team play will obviously have a huge influence on their chances of creating a vibrant corner of the Holte End in the Black Country, but the claret and blue army will make themselves heard.</p>
      <p><b>SW:</b> The midfield hub. Without a doubt. The tenacity of McGinn, Luiz and Nakamba could be the undoing of Wolves if Nuno plays his usual tactics. Wolves need to get Dendoncker or Saiss in there to allow the creativity of Neves and Moutinho. They could get swamped in that engine room if the tactics are wrong.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>What's your combined XI?</h3>
      <p><b>AD:</b> (4-3-3) Patricio; Doherty, Boly, Mings, Jonny; Moutinho, Dendoncker, McGinn; Adama, Jimenez, D.Jota</p>
      <p><b>AP:</b> (4-3-3) Heaton; Doherty, Boly, Mings, Targett; McGinn, Moutinho, Grealish; Adama, Jimenez, D.Jota</p>
      <p><b>BH:</b> (4-3-3) Patricio; Doherty, Boly, Mings, Jonny; McGinn, Dendoncker, Moutinho; Adama, Jimenez, D.Jota</p>
      <p><b>JC:</b> (3-5-2) Patricio; Boly, Coady, Mings; Doherty, Grealish, Moutinho, McGinn, Jonny; D.Jota, Jimenez</p>
      <p><b>MK:</b> (4-3-3) Heaton; Guilbert, Boly, Mings, Jonny; Moutinho, McGinn, Grealish; Adama, Jimenez, Trezeguet</p>
      <p><b>SW:</b> (4-4-2) Patricio; Doherty, Boly, Mings, Jonny; Adama, McGinn, Moutinho, Grealish; D.Jota; Jimenez</p>

      <h3>And what's your prediction?</h3>
      <p><b>AD:</b> I think Wolves, roared on by a sell out crowd at Molineux, will have too much for Villa on Sunday. I'm going 2-0 Wolves with Jimenez and Neves to score.</p>
      <p><b>AP:</b> My prediction for Sunday will be a Desmond, 2-2. Both sides will fancy their chances and Wolves will have revenge on their minds after being booted out of the cup as recently as last week. It's all set for a brilliant local derby and could be one to remember on Remembrance Sunday.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><b>BH:</b> Wolves could really do with starting a game well for once. Villa tend to look much better in the first half, whereas Nuno's men come on strong in the second half. You feel that if Wolves can grab the initiative and make Villa throw men forward, the likes of Jota, Traore and Jimenez could run them ragged. 3-1 Wolves.</p>
      <p><b>JC:</b> 2-1 Wolves. Jota and Jimenez to score, McGinn to make it interesting late on.</p>
      <p><b>MK:</b> 1-1</p>
      <p><b>SW:</b> I think it will be a tight game, not many goals and I reckon I might drop a cheeky bet on 1-1 with Wolves threatening to win in the final minutes.</p>
