      <p>OTTAWA - Canadian health officials say a chemical compound discovered in lung fluid taken from 29 patients with a mysterious vaping related illness is not allowed in Canadian cannabis vaping products.</p>
      <p>Still a spokesperson for Health Canada says the agency, along with the Public Health Agency of Canada, is actively monitoring the apparent U.S. breakthrough.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say they have a "very strong culprit" in vitamin E acetate, which has only recently been used as a thickener in vaping fluid, particularly in black market vape cartridges.</p>
      <p>While vitamin E is safe as a vitamin pill or to use on the skin, inhaling oily droplets of it can be harmful because the sticky substances can stay in the lungs.</p>
      <p>More than 2,000 Americans have gotten sick since March -- many of them teens and young adults -- and at least 40 people have died.</p>
      <p>There have been seven confirmed or probable cases of severe lung illness related to vaping in Canada -- two confirmed cases in Quebec, two probable cases in New Brunswick and three probable cases in B.C.</p>
      <p>U.S. officials said Friday this is the first time they've found a common suspect in the damaged lungs of patients, but cautioned they cannot rule out all other toxic substances.</p>
