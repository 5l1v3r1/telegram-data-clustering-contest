      <h1>Full transcript from Unai Emery press conference after Arsenal defeat to Leicester</h1>
      <h2>The Gunners, winless in the Premier League for over a month, slipped eight points behind the top four with Emery's position under increasing scrutiny</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T20:23:56+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 20:23</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Red-hot Jamie Vardy piled the pressure on Arsenal boss Unai Emery as the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> striker continued to haunt the Gunners.</p>
      <p>The forward scored his ninth goal in nine starts against the Gunners to inspire the Foxes to a 2-0 win and into second in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Vardy, the top flight's 11-goal leading scorer, also set up James Maddison's clincher as Emery's side slumped to a limp defeat at the King Power Stadium.</p>
      <p>Alexandre Lacazette wasted Arsenal's best chance and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had a goal disallowed but the visitors were poor.</p>
      <p>The Gunners, winless in the Premier League for over a month, slipped eight points behind the top four with Emery's position under increasing scrutiny.</p>

      <h3>On the result...</h3>
      <p>“We can be disappointed but the attitude of the players, they did the gameplan.</p>
      <p>“In the second half we created some chances and when they scored we lost that opportunity.”</p>
      <h3>On the table...</h3>
      <p>“We are distant from them now but we will take time to prepare and improve and take the balance in the team.</p>
      <p>“<a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> and Spurs are also behind us so it is an equal competition but we have time to reduce the gap on Leicester.”</p>

      <h3>On home form...</h3>
      <p>“If we can play strong at home, I know we can play well when we play away.</p>
      <p>“We didn’t lose at home but today lost here because Leicester are at home and feel strong here.”</p>
      <h3>On critcism...</h3>
      <p>“I am speaking with the club to stay strong and recover. We also have young players who are growing up with us.</p>
      <p>“I know we are receiving criticism but I have done before and I have recovered.</p>
      <p>“I accept all the criticism. It is normal. Today we did one step ahead being better defensively.”</p>

      <h3>On the last month of results...</h3>
      <p>"We need to recover our confidence. We need to be patient with some circumstances and we are going to do that.”</p>
      <h3>On his three-man defence...</h3>
      <p>“I think the players felt good in that system.</p>
      <p>“Last year we used it and we did well. It depends how we can get our best qualities and we used that system last year with a lot of good results.”</p>
