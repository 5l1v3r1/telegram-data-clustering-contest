      <p>Polokwane -<b> Baroka FC</b> earned themselves some breathing room in the bottom half of the Absa Premiership table as Prince Nxumalo's early goal sealed a 1-0 win over <b>Polokwane City</b> at Pietersburg Stadium on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Polokwane went into this clash without a head coach after parting ways with Serbian Zlatko Krmpotic on Friday.</p>
      <p>And, after a run of four straight defeats in the Absa Premiership, Rise and Shine were hoping to kick-start a revival with a victory over Bakgaga.</p>
      <p>Baroka, on the other hand, were in a similar position in the league standings, having collected just one point from their previous four league fixtures.</p>
      <p>Nxumalo made his debut in the goalless draw with defending champions Mamelodi Sundowns in midweek, and retained his place in the starting XI for the clash with Polokwane.</p>
      <p>He repaid the faith shown in him by head coach Wedson Nyirenda as he slotted home after just seven minutes of play to give the visitors an early lead.</p>
      <p>Polokwane redoubled their efforts after falling behind, but they were unable to break down an obstinate Baroka defence as the visitors held on to their slender advantage heading into the half-time break.</p>
      <p>Despite scoring a brilliant hat-trick in the 5-3 defeat to Cape Town City in midweek, Charlton Mashumba was unable to repeat his heroics after the break as Polokwane again struggled to stamp their mark on proceedings.</p>
      <p>While Baroka were unable to add to their early advantage, the solitary goal proved enough in the end as the visitors came out on top in a closely contested Limpopo derby.</p>
