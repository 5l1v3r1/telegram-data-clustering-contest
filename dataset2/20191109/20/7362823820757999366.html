      <p>"Thank God I had my baby; it was a week after he passed. So there was something to move forward,” Mendes revealed. “There was poetry to it all.”</p>
      <p>Her second daughter, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/eva-mendes-and-ryan-gosling-kept-birth-of-their-2nd-girl-a-secret-for-two-weeks">Amada Lee</a>, was born 12 days after Juan Carlos died on April 17, 2016, after a long battle with cancer. He was 53 years old.</p>

      <p>“My favorite memories are when he used to, at Thanksgiving or a big dinner or Christmas dinner, roast everybody — but roast you hard,” she remembered.</p>
      <p>“Of course, I miss him incredibly, and that’s an understatement, but I’m holding on to that tradition. I’m so happy that he gave me that," she said. "I don’t think I could carry it on the way he did, but those are some fun memories because he would really get raw.”</p>

      <p>"I’d like to try and thank one person properly, and to say that while I was singing and dancing and playing piano and having one of the best experiences I’ve ever had on a film, my lady was raising our daughter, pregnant with our second, and trying to help her brother fight his battle with cancer," he said.</p>

      <p>"If she hadn’t taken all that on so that I could have this experience, it would surely be someone else up here other than me today. So, sweetheart, thank you. To my daughters, Amada and Esmerelda, I love you. And if I may, I’d like to dedicate this to the memory of her brother, Juan Carlos Mendes."</p>
