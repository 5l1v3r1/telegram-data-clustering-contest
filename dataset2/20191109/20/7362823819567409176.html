      <h1>Doug Schoen: Michael Bloomberg is 'most substantive' of potential 2020 Dem nominees</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T20:26:10+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 20:26</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Dorman</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/person/s/douglas-schoen">Doug Schoen</a>, a Democratic strategist and Fox News contributor, touted former New York City Mayor <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/michael-bloomberg">Michael Bloomberg</a> as a "substantive" candidate for the Democratic nomination in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/2020-presidential-election">2020</a>.</p>
      <p>"I think he's the most substantive candidate in the field and I think that he offers a unique approach both to the Democratic primary and ultimately, the election," Schoen said while appearing on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/shows/americas-news-hq">"America's News HQ."</a></p>
      <p>Schoen's comments came as President Trump predicted on Friday that Bloomberg wouldn't "do well" and would hurt former <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden">Vice President Joe Biden</a> in the 2020 race. "Little Michael will fail," Trump said outside of the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/white-house">White House.</a></p>
      <p>While Bloomberg has filed to run as a candidate in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/alabama">Alabama's</a> Democratic primary, he has yet to make an official announcement.</p>

      <p>Schoen said on Saturday that he was "all in" for Bloomberg, who won two New York City mayoral elections as a Republican.</p>
      <p>"He has a unique appeal ... he's been a mayor, he's been a business leader, he's a philanthropist, he's got a progressive issue agenda of gun control, climate change, public health, education," Schoen said.</p>
      <p>But Republican strategist Kim Alfano described Bloomberg's strategy as "flawed from the getgo," noting that he wasn't planning on competing in Iowa or New Hampshire -- the first two states to hold nominating contests.</p>
      <p>"If you can't play in those first two primaries, then the bus is going to leave you behind," Alfano said.</p>

      <p>Schoen countered that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/iowa">Iowa</a> and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-hampshire">New Hampshire</a> only represented a small percentage of the delegates, while Bloomberg could be able to pick up substantially more delegates on Super Tuesday.</p>
      <p>"The ball game really begins on Super Tuesday when about 40 percent of the delegates are at stake and that's when Michael Bloomberg has I think preliminarily ... decided to begin his campaign should he go forward," he said.</p>
