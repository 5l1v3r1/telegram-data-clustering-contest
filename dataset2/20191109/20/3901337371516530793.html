      <p><b>Teams:</b> Barcelona v Celta Vigo</p>
      <p><b>Date:</b> 09 November 2019</p>
      <p><b>Venue:</b> Camp Nou</p>
      <p>After being jeered by the own supporters this week, LaLiga leaders FC Barcelona aim to get back on the winning trail with the visit of Celta Vigo on Saturday evening - Here's how they line up.</p>
      <p>The match is scheduled to get underway at 22h00.</p>
      <p>The Catalan giants endured a frustrating evening on Tuesday after being held to a goalless draw by Slavia Praha in the UEFA Champions League, which left the home crowd unhappy.</p>
      <p>The stalemate comes after a disappointing 3-1 loss at the hands of Levante last weekend, which saw Real Madrid and Sociedad move level on points with the Catalan outfit.</p>
      <p>Celta Vigo, meanwhile, will be eager to back to winning ways as they come into the encounter on the back of a four successive loss in the Spanish top flight.</p>
      <p>When these two sides last met, it was Celta who claimed a 2-0 victory at the Abanca-Balaídos although Ernesto Valverde's claimed the spoils in this fixture last season.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Here's how they line up:</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>FC Barcelona:</b> Ter Stegen; Junior, Umtiti, Piqué, Semedo; Sergi Roberto, De Jong, Arthur; Ansu Fati, Griezmann, Messi.</p>
      <p><b>Celta Vigo: </b>Blanco, Juncà, Mallo, Aidoo, Olaza, Araujo, Beltrán, Diop, Lobotka, Aspas, Sisto.</p>
