        <b>The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have reunited for the Royal British Legion's annual Festival of Remembrance.</b>
      </p>
      <p>They joined the Queen and other members of the Royal Family at the Royal Albert Hall to commemorate those who lost their lives in conflicts.</p>
      <p>It is their first appearance as a group since Harry and Meghan <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-50119219">said they were struggling with public life</a>.</p>
      <p>The annual event is also being attended by servicemen and women.</p>
      <p>It comes ahead of the Remembrance Day service at the Cenotaph in central London on Sunday, which will also be attended by senior members of the Royal Family.</p>

      <p>Saturday's event marks 75 years since notable battles of 1944, including Monte Cassino, Kohima and Imphal, D-Day and the collaboration of Commonwealth and Allied forces.</p>
      <p>It also celebrates the 100th anniversary of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) and pays tribute to the RFA Mounts Bay, which delivered supplies and aid to the Bahamas after Hurricane Dorian this year.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his girlfriend Carrie Symonds joined other members of the Royal Family in the royal box.</p>

      <p>In interviews in October, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-50128683">the Sussexes both said they were struggling</a> with the intense scrutiny from elements of the British tabloid press.</p>
      <p>Prince Harry, 35, described his mental health and the way he deals with the pressures of his life as a matter of "constant management".</p>
      <p>And Meghan, 38, said in an ITV documentary that adjusting to royal life had been "hard".</p>

      <p>Prince Harry also responded to reports of a rift between him and his brother William by saying they were on "different paths" and have "good days" and "bad days".</p>
      <p>Following the documentary, a Kensington Palace source <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-50128683">played down suggestions</a> that the Duke of Cambridge was "furious" with his brother about the interview, saying he was "worried" and hoped the couple "are all right".</p>
