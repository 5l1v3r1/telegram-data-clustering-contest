      <p>Logan Paul will cash in tonight whether he wins or loses his rematch with fellow social media star KSI.</p>
      <p>But his rise to become one of the most influential social media users is no rags to riches story.</p>
      <p>Paul was born in Ohio to parents Pamela Ann Stepnick and Gregory Allan Paul with the family later completed by younger brother Jake.</p>
      <p>Paul dabbled in several sports at school but it was YouTube which grabbed his attention from as young as 10 years old when he began posting videos to a channel called Zoosh.</p>
      <p>He remained education-focused however and went to college to study industrial Engineering but by this point he had a sizeable YouTube following and had a made a splash on the now defunct Vine platform.</p>

      <p>Paul took the decision to drop out of college in 2014 and moved to Los Angeles where he rented a house with other up-and-coming social media stars.</p>
      <p>Within a year his following across the major platforms had exploded with his YouTube videos watched by millions.</p>
      <p>At this stage he began earning serious money; while initially his six-second clips on Vine would earn him $2,000, he quickly increased that to six figures once in LA.</p>
      <p>Slowly but surely Paul began to break into the mainstream with a part in Law &amp; Order and roles in adverts for Pepsi and HBO.</p>
      <p>By 2016, Vine had been bought by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> and uploads were disabled, but Paul had grown his YouTube following to such an extent that he was reportedly earning upwards of $200,000 a month from the video sharing platform.</p>
      <p>But his earnings and reputation took a hit in 2017 when he and a group of friends visited the infamous 'suicide forest' in Japan and filmed a dead body.</p>
      <p>He was punished by YouTube and lost sponsorship details which he believes cost him $5million.</p>

      <p>“YouTube had to take a stance,” he told the Hollywood Reporter. “They’re not going to let some kid fuck up their ad platform.”</p>
      <p>But Paul was not down for long, in part thanks to his 'Maverick' merchandise which earns up $10m a year, which meant he is understood to have earned more than $14m last year.</p>
      <p>And of course, this was all before he branched out into the world of boxing, starting with his first fight with KSI in Manchester last year.</p>
      <p>Estimates have varied widely as to how much the social media stars earned from the bout which drew a crowd of 15,000 and was watched by millions on YouTube pay-per-view.</p>
      <p>Claims that they shared $150m were rubbished with the final figure likely to have been in the seven figures.</p>
      <p>That figure could double after the rematch with KSI this weekend and that could take Paul's net worth into the $20m range.</p>
