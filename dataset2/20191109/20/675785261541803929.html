      <h1>Remembrance Sunday charities like British Legion hit by vile online fraud scams</h1>
      <h2>Website scammers are claiming their wares commemorate our war dead and they donate to charities including the Royal British Legion</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T20:14:19+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 20:14</time> by <a rel="author">Stephen Hayward, Matthew Acton, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>Fraudsters are cashing in on Remembrance Sunday with a string of online merchandise scams.</p>
      <p>Scammers claim their wares commemorate our war dead and they donate to charities including the Royal British Legion.</p>
      <p>But it is illegal for sellers to make the claims without official charity tie-ins.</p>
      <p>The crooks are believed to be paying as little as £10 for ads on social media sites selling brooches, lapel badges and scarves.</p>
      <p>One <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> ad by a site calling itself Heroes Forever, offering lapel badges at £12.95 each, has had 285,000 views.</p>

      <p>The website claims the Royal British Legion “benefits” from sales.</p>
      <p>But people who have ordered items have said weeks later nothing has arrived in the post.</p>
      <p>The RBL says it is probing the Heroes Forever site, which has now been taken down, as well as two sites called heroesinflanders and inflandersfields.</p>
      <p>The Royal British Legion said: “Sales of legitimate RBL poppy products raise vital funds for our work.</p>

      <p>“Commercial entities who raise funds on behalf of the RBL must do so under contract.</p>
      <p>"We monitor the activities of those who claim to raise money on our behalf to ensure their activities are legitimate.”</p>
      <p>Facebook said it was looking into the accounts.</p>
      <p>A spokesman said: “All advertisers must adhere to our standards, which set out limits for acceptable behaviour and content. That includes misleading ads. We have removed the ad shared with us.”</p>
      <p>Heroes Forever has no connection to the US charity of the same name, helping kids with cancer.</p>
