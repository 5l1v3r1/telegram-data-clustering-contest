      <p>German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier has implored the United States to be a mutually respectful partner and abandon national egoism.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the Brandenburg Gate during celebrations dedicated to the fall of the Berlin Wall, Steinmeier recalled the US role in bringing down the barrier.</p>
      <blockquote>"This America as a mutually respectful partner, as a partner for democracy and freedom, against national egoism - that is what I hope for in the future too," the president stated.</blockquote>
      <p>Steinmeier admitted that he can still remember former US President Ronald Reagan's speech at the Brandenburg Gate in which he called for the demolition of the wall.</p>
      <p>The Berlin Wall was regarded as an “iron curtain” <a href="https://sputniknews.com/multimedia/201911091077265110-beyond-the-berlin-wall-daily-life-in-east-germany-captured-by-unique-museum-showpieces/">separating</a> Western and Eastern Europe during the Cold War, both physically and ideologically.</p>
      <p>The official demolition of the Wall began on 13 June 1990 and resulted in Germany's reunification on 3 October that same year.</p>
