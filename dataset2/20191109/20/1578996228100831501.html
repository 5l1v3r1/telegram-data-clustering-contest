      <h1>Kylie Jenner and Drake Reportedly ‘Have Chemistry, Flirt, and Hang Out’</h1>

      <p>Kylie Jenner and Drake may be spending some more quality time together, but they’re not necessarily “together.” <a href="https://people.com/tv/kylie-jenner-drake-flirt-hang-out-not-in-relationship-source/">According to </a><i><a href="https://people.com/tv/kylie-jenner-drake-flirt-hang-out-not-in-relationship-source/">People</a></i>, they’re trying to keep things as uncomplicated as possible.</p>
      <p>“She has been hanging out with Drake. Mostly together with other friends as well,” the source said. “She has known Drake for a while. They are not in a relationship. It mostly seems like they have chemistry, flirt and hang out. Nothing too complicated.”</p>
      <p>Jenner broke up with her longtime boyfriend, Travis Scott, last month. At the time both she and Scott said they remain on good terms and are focused on raising their child, Stormi, together. Despite the Drake rumors, Stormi remains Jenner’s top priority.</p>
      <p>“Kylie is doing great. She considers herself single,” the source continued, adding that “her main focus is Stormi, but she is also young and likes to have fun.”</p>
      <p>Scott and Jenner still spend plenty of time together, even more so after Scott suffered a knee injury during a concert <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29523013/kylie-jenner-travis-scott-hanging-out-post-break-up/">last month</a>.</p>
      <p>“It’s not anything new that they spend a lot of time together. Even after they decided to take a break, they still spent time together with Stormi. And Travis was always free to come and go at Kylie’s so he can see Stormi,” a source said at the time. “Now when he isn’t working, his free time is all about Stormi. Kylie and Travis always had fun co-parenting, but you can tell that Kylie is happy Travis isn’t working right now. She is happy that he is around.”</p>
