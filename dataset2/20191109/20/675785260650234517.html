      <h2>The UN has already warned 10 million people need urgent assistance, and satellite images reveal poor crops as experts warn the dictator could become more dangerous</h2>

      <p>Starving North Koreans are facing a miserable winter following a poor harvest, experts have warned.</p>
      <p>The secretive state, which is already facing food shortages, has had a poor crop as a result of drought followed by widespread flooding.</p>
      <p>Crop analysts from monitoring group Geoglam, using satellite images, say this year's harvest is the smallest in five years, with the so-called "cereal bowl" in the south of the country badly hit.</p>
      <p>Despite 70% of North Koreans being reliant on rations, which were cut in May, dictator Kim Jong-un continues to plough resources into his nuclear weapons programme.</p>
      <p>World leaders have placed sanctions on North Korea as a result.</p>
      <p>In August an expert on North Korea <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/kim-jong-un-will-become-18933718">warned that Kim could become more volatile</a> during food shortages at the end of the year.</p>

      <p>Professor Srinivasan Sitaraman told Mirror Online: "It's when the winter arrives that trouble will arrive.</p>
      <p>"There will be food shortages, and that's when North Koreans are going to feel the pinch from the sanctions."</p>
      <p>The UN has said crop production is at its lowest level in five years, and four out of 10 North Koreans require food aid.</p>
      <p>Two months ago the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) warned that 10 million people are in urgent need of help.</p>

      <p>And the World Food Programme says the population eats dangerously little protein.</p>
      <p>In May food rations were cut from 550g to 300g, and this has been made worse after Typhoon Lingling flooded farmland, following months of severe droughts.</p>
      <p>Geoglam said the harvest from South and North Hwanghae and South Pyongyan in the south was below average.</p>
      <p>At the end of last month North Korea fired two projectiles into the Sea of Japan in what appears to be its latest ballistic missile launch days after a warning to the US.</p>

      <p>Kim oversaw the launch, which saw the missiles fly for 230 miles at an altitude of 56 miles, according to Seoul's military.</p>
      <p>An air base used by Japan and the US issued a "real world missile alert" and told personnel to "seek shelter". Ships in the Sea of Japan were also warned.</p>
      <p>The US has demanded North Korea abandons its nuclear programme, but Kim has shown little desire to fall into line, despite the suffering of the population.</p>
