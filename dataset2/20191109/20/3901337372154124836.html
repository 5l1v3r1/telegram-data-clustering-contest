        <b>Ligue 1</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Result:</b> Brest 1-2 Paris Saint Germain</p>

      <p>Paris Saint Germain held off a resilient Brest in Ligue to claim a 2-1 victory at the Stade Francis-Le Ble on Saturday evening.</p>
      <p>The reigning champions welcomed back record goal-scorer Edison Cavani, who returned to their front-line since August with Mauro Icardi dropped to the substitute bench.</p>
      <p>PSG closed in to an early lead inside 12 minutes after a ball in the area found Pablo Sarabia, who opened space only to drag his effort wide of the intended target.</p>
      <p>The newly-promoted side battled extremely to contain the free-flowing displays from their illustrious adversaries who upped the ante on 21 minutes with a goal-bound strike from Julian Draxler.</p>
      <p>Brest removed the chains and ventured into advancing areas five minutes later, though Yoann Court couldn’t profit from poor defending as he fired into the side-netting from a clear opening.</p>
      <p>The host paid the penalty six minutes to halftime when Angel Di Maria confidently lobbed Gautier Larsonneur who got drawn out from Draxler’s assist.</p>
      <p>There were no changes at the restart, as both managers kept faith with the initial tried and tested contingent that did duty in the first spell.</p>
      <p>Brest were renewed though on 49 minutes as Thiago Silva’s to an acrobatic overhead clearance off fell kindly to Court who fired blanks in the end.</p>
      <p>The game’s first substitution arrived from the home side when Mathias Autret made way for the introduction of Samuel Grandsir after 65 minutes.</p>
      <p>Having been on the pitch for five minutes, Grandsir was left with acres of space on the left side of the area as he picked his spot to drill through Sergio Rico.</p>
      <p>Thomas Tuchel introduced Icardi for Cavani in the final ten minutes, and the Argentine repaid the faith five minutes later after finishing off a defensive mix-up.</p>
      <p>PSG pulled ten points clear at the top of the table following the victory ahead of second-place Angers.</p>
