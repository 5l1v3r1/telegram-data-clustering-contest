      <p>"We are the Albion, we're top of the league..."</p>
      <p>That simple nine-word message was belted out at full pelt at Hull City as West Bromwich Albion preserved their place at the Championship summit.</p>
      <p>Jake Livermore's 28th minute striker proved to be the winner against his former club at the KCOM Stadium.</p>
      <p>The 1-0 victory keeps the Baggies top of the pile going into the latest international break with 33 points from 16 matches, two ahead of nearest challengers Preston North End.</p>

      <p>They were certainly in fine voice up at Hull, with euphoric scenes as they added another three points to their promoton-chasing tally.</p>
