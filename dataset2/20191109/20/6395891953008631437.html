      <p><b>NEEDHAM, Mass.Â (AP)</b> - A Massachusetts solider killed in World War II has been laid to rest after his remains were recently identified.</p>
      <p>WCVB-TV reports a memorial service was held Saturday at St. Joseph church in Needham, Massachusetts for U.S. Army 1st Lt. Joseph Edward Finneran.</p>
      <p>He was then buried with full military honors in Mount Benedict Cemetery in Boston's West Roxbury neighborhood, alongside his mother.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old was shot down north of Bucharest, Romania on Aug. 1, 1943 during a bombing mission. He was posthumously awarded the Purple Heart and other military honors.</p>
      <p>Finneran's unidentified remains had been kept inside a military cemetery in Belgium for 70 years along with other Americans killed during "Operation Tidal Wave."</p>
      <p>The Pentagon last month announced it had accounted for Finneran using anthropological and DNA analysis.</p>
