      <h1>Andrew Conway's 50-metre solo effort saves Munster from provincial rivals Ulster</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T20:23:54+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 20:23</time> by <a rel="author">By Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>Andrew Conway provided a match-winning try of real class as <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/munster">Munster</a> battled past <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/ulster">Ulster</a> in a 22-16 Guinness PRO14 derby win at Thomond Park.</p>
      <p>Conway, one of eight returning <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/rugby-world-cup">Rugby World Cup</a> players for the hosts, accelerated clear from just inside halfway to raid in under the posts and split the provincial rivals in the 64th minute.</p>
      <p>Tries from <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/ireland/players/cj-stander/">CJ Stander</a> and man-of-the-match <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/ireland/players/rory-scannell/">Rory Scannell</a> helped Munster to carve out a 15-6 interval lead with Ulster’s talisman <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/ulster/players/john-cooney/">John Cooney</a> kicking their six points from the tee.</p>
      <p>Winless in Limerick since 2014, the Ulstermen edged ahead thanks to captain Rob Herring’s 49th-minute try off a lineout maul amid a promising 10-point spurt.</p>

      <p>But Conway’s superb seven-pointer got Munster back on track as they kept up with the pace in Conference B.</p>
      <p>With both sides eager to keep up their winning momentum ahead of the start of Europe, it was Cooney who kicked Ulster ahead from close range in the third minute.</p>
      <p>The visitors had a let-off when Jacob Stockdale’s clearance kick bounced off Conway and they coughed up a five-metre scrum.</p>

      </p>
      <p>However, the set-piece platform was duly turned into seven points by Munster who had centre Scannell and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/munster/players/alby-mathewson/">Alby Mathewson</a> both go close before Stander muscled in under the posts.</p>
      <p>JJ Hanrahan’s conversion was followed by a Cooney penalty at the end of an evenly-contested first quarter.</p>
      <p>Both defences were proving difficult to break down, and it was errors which were mainly leading to scores. Hanrahan punished an Ulster penalty with three more points at 10-6 before his evening was disappointingly cut short through injury.</p>

      <p>A Martin Moore spill ruined a slick Ulster move, and it was Munster who pushed on as half-time approached.</p>
      <p>They trucked it up through the forwards and Mathewson, who was a busy figure throughout, before some great hands from replacement <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/munster/players/tyler-bleyendaal/">Tyler Bleyendaal</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/ireland/players/chris-farrell/">Chris Farrell</a> allowed Scannell to plough over near the left corner.</p>
      <p>Bleyendaal’s conversion bounced back off the post and the deficit for Ulster remained at nine points despite some mishandling from <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/highlanders/players/matt-faddes/">Matt Faddes</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/ulster/players/angus-curtis/">Angus Curtis</a>, who made his first start at fly-half. Collectively, Dan McFarland’s men were an improved force on the restart.</p>

      <p>Munster captain Peter O’Mahony stole two early season half lineouts, yet his <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/ireland">Ireland</a> colleague Herring sparked the best out of Ulster when breaking from a maul, ten metres out, and evading Bleyendaal’s tackle to crash over to the right of the posts.</p>
      <p>Cooney converted and also punished Stander for going off his feet in the 57th minute, booting Ulster back in front at 16-15.</p>

      <p>The game’s decisive moment arrived seven minutes later with Conway – set free by Bleyendaal’s inside pass – evading three defenders on a superb slaloming run to the whitewash.</p>
      <p>Bleyendaal converted for a six-point cushion, and while Ulster had enough possession to fashion a response, they were starved of territory late on.</p>
      <p>Bleyendaal missed a long-range penalty before his pass was intercepted by <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/ulster/players/stuart-mccloskey/">Stuart McCloskey</a>, but his opposite number Scannell quickly shut down the attack with a crucial tackle.</p>
