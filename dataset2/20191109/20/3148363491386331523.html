      <p>John Henderson is 106 years old and his wife, Charlotte, is 105, which is a <a href="https://www.ksdk.com/article/news/local/austin-duo-breaks-guinness-world-record-for-oldest-married-couple/269-7e6d00ed-8077-4de3-9f43-b66f53521964">combined</a> age of 211 years. John <a href="https://fox40.com/2019/11/08/a-husband-and-wife-in-texas-are-officially-the-oldest-living-couple-in-the-world/">said</a> one of the secrets to their long and happy marriage is being kind to one another.</p>
      <p>“Live life in moderation and be cordial to your spouse,” he stated.</p>
      <p>The couple <a href="https://www.kxan.com/news/local-news/austin-husband-and-wife-named-worlds-oldest-living-married-couple-by-guinness-world-records/">met</a> while taking classes at the University of Texas (UT) in 1934, when she was studying to become a teacher and he was playing football for the Longhorn team.</p>
      <p>John is also the oldest living former UT football player and has attended games with his wife at least once every season for the past 84 years.</p>
      <p>The Hendersons were married during the Great Depression on December 15, 1939, and <a href="https://5newsonline.com/2019/11/08/texas-duo-breaks-guinness-world-record-for-oldest-married-couple/">said</a> the hotel room they rented for their honeymoon only cost them $7 at the time. Next month will mark their 80th wedding anniversary.</p>
      <p>Both John and Charlotte are in excellent health and spend their days together at Longhorn Village, a senior living community for former UT staff and alumni.</p>
      <p>Social media users took to the Guinness World Record <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/oldest-married-couple-aggregate-age">website</a> to offer their congratulations to the Henderson’s on reaching such an important milestone.</p>
      <p>“John almost looks the same. His early pictures show that little almost hidden forever smile on his face and it seems to always be there,” wrote Sophia Plummer.</p>
      <p>“Thats his secret. There’s a smile. He just keeps looking happy and its worked 106 years. Shes beautiful. Congratulations to this wonderful couple. May God always bless them,” she concluded.</p>
      <p>“They are the most amazing couple-both still very sharp. Congratulations Henderson’s!!!!!” wrote Kay Hollenbeck.</p>
      <p>In October, a couple in Paris, Texas, who was recognized by Gov. Greg Abbott in 2018 as the state’s “Longest Married Couple” celebrated their 82nd anniversary.</p>
      <p>One-hundred-year-old Johnnie Leroy Chaffin and his wife, Fannie, 97, said the secret to their long and happy union was simple.</p>
      <p>“Love is all I know. Love is one of the greatest things in the world if it’s done right. And that’s the way it is,” Johnnie said.</p>
      <p>“I did love you,” his wife added. “So much, that’s why we had a house full of kids.”</p>
