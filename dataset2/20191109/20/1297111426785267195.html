      <p>In an opera, you expect the performers to be singing the entire time.</p>
      <p>But there’s a scene in Missing wherein Rose-Ellen Nichols just weeps.</p>
      <p>Weep isn’t a strong enough word. She’s in anguish.</p>
      <p>She portrays a character simply called Native Mother. Her daughter has gone missing on British Columbia’s Highway 16, the Highway of Tears, where so many Indigenous women have disappeared.</p>
      <p>Later, she does sing: “If you have loved a child, I am you.”</p>
      <p>B.C. playwright Marie Clements, who wrote the libretto (script) of this chamber opera, <a href="https://leaderpost.com/entertainment/local-arts/regina-expat-molloy-reflects-on-missing-and-the-truth-it-conveys">said her goal was to reflect how “all human beings … love our children and we want the best for them.”</a></p>
      <p>It’s a heart-wrenching production. The many tissue boxes placed throughout the Regina Performing Arts Centre were warranted.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://leaderpost.com/entertainment/local-arts/rso-seeks-to-open-eyes-and-hearts-in-missing-opera-co-production">The hope in presenting Missing in Regina on Friday and Saturday (Nov. 8 and 9) was to help bridge the divide between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people.</a>
      </p>
      <p>But Missing does just as well to make perfectly clear the divide that exists in Canadian society.</p>
      <p>It does so through the journeys of two main characters.</p>

      <p>Joanna Diindiisikwe Simmons portrays the young Indigenous woman, who appears as a ghost throughout the performance — often behind a sheer screen that enlivens the show with projections. (The set design by Andy Moro is absolutely incredible.)</p>
      <p>Caitlin Wood plays Ava, the young white woman whose life is transformed through their fleeting first connection.</p>
      <p>To begin Missing, Ava is thrown violently from a car on the highway, screeching tires, crashing glass, blood. She sees the other woman, also having suffered violence along the same road.</p>
      <p>Ava is changed. Her eyes are opened. They continue to open.</p>
      <p>At university, Dr. Rose Wilson (the amazing Marion Newman) challenges her class.</p>
      <p>“What do you see when you see me?” she sings. “Do you recognize me as a human being?</p>
      <p>“There are 3,000 Native women missing in this country, 3,000 missing,” Newman continues. “What happens to a society when we can’t recognize a fellow human being as part of ourselves? What are we missing?”</p>
      <p>Ava’s friend Jess (Regina expat Heather Molloy) says what so many people think.</p>
      <p>“It’s their decisions. It’s their fault. … I don’t want to be attacked,” Molloy sings. Feeling provoked, she adds, “You are less than me. Less than us. You always have been.”</p>
      <p>Later, the missing girl’s brother (Kyle Lehmann) corrects a stereotype. “My sister was on her way home from school,” he sings. “She was going to go to law school to be a lawyer. She had plans. She wanted a family. She wanted to live. She wanted to love. She wanted what every human being wants.”</p>

      <p>Throughout all of this, conductor Timothy Long (not the same-named MacKenzie Art Gallery curator) led seven musicians to create a soundtrack, written by Juno Award winner Brian Current. On cello (Simon Fryer), <a href="https://leaderpost.com/life/queen-city/reginas-musicality-thrills-new-rso-concertmaster">violin (Christian Robinson),</a> flute (Marie-Noelle Berthelet), clarinet (Hyonsuk Kim), percussion (Aaron Mattock and Kevin Grady) and piano (Stephane Mayer), they tirelessly played beautiful, interesting music.</p>
      <p>Missing was devised in 2017 through City Opera Vancouver and Pacific Opera Victoria. It was co-presented in Regina by the Regina Symphony Orchestra and Regina Treaty/Status Indian Services (RT/SIS).</p>
      <p>Before Friday night’s show, there was acknowledgment of the family members in the audience, survivors whose loved ones are among the many missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls in Canada.</p>
      <p>One was Alana Moshenko, whose aunt Cynthia Sanderson was killed in Prince Albert in 2002; witnesses said truck driver Anthony Barr shouted racial slurs before running her over. <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/one-thing-in-common-conference-gathers-families-of-mmiwg-to-share-stories">Another was Myrna LaPlante, whose aunt disappeared without a trace from her home near Raymore in 2007.</a></p>
      <p>“This is what we live,” said Bernie Williams, a woman from Haida Gwaii, who lost her mother and three sisters.</p>
      <p>“These are women that were loved, valued and missed,” she added. “The thought process of who we are needs to change.”</p>
      <p>RT/SIS executive director Erica Beaudin challenged the audience to ask, “How can I make change?”</p>
      <p>Cheryl Littletent of Kawacatoose First Nation led a prayer. She thanked the actors for helping show what Indigenous people go through.</p>
      <p>Tickets for Saturday night’s show are $25 and can be found at <a href="https://mytickets.reginasymphony.com/TheatreManager/1/online?performance=432">reginasymphony.com.</a></p>
