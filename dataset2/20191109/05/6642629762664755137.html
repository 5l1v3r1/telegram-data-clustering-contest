      <p><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/india.html">India</a> has deployed more than 5,000 troops and police in the northern town of Ayodhya in advance of an expected Supreme Court ruling on Saturday over control of a religious site disputed by Hindus and Muslims.</p>
      <p>Muslims said they prayed at the medieval era Babri Mosque for centuries until the idol of Ram deity was surreptitiously placed inside the mosque in 1949.</p>
      <p>Hindus believe that the mosque was built under Mughal ruler Babur after destroying a Hindu temple. In 1992, Hindu mobs demolished the Babri mosque, and constructed a makeshift temple of Lord Ram, a physical incarnation of the god Vishnu, who is believed to have been born at the site. </p>
      <p>The destruction of the 16th-century mosque sparked nationwide Hindu-Muslim violence that left about 2,000 people dead, most of them Muslims.</p>
      <p>In the decades since it was razed, religious groups have fought in the courts over who should control it.</p>
      <p>Authorities fear mass unrest, as thousands of Hindu monks and devotees have been arriving in Ayodhya located in Uttar Pradesh state in anticipation of the judgment of a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court, headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court has to decide on the appeals against a key 2010 verdict by the High Court which ruled that both groups should split the site, with Hindus granted the lion's share.</p>
      <p>The court had ruled that the disputed area of 2.77 acres (1.12 hectares) be divided into three equal parts, with two-thirds going to the Hindu community and one-third to Muslims.</p>
      <p>Sanjay Kapoor, Editor of New Delhi's Hardnews magazine, said this dispute has changed the politics in the country.</p>
      <p>" The entire movement has changed the vocabulary of politics, the [way] people discuss this matter, it has brought BJP as a national force," Kapoor told Al Jazeera.</p>
      <p>"In a certain way this dispute ... has changed the way secular India was really conceived in 1947," he added. </p>
      <h3>Modi calls for calm</h3>
      <p>Prime Minister <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/narendra-modi-141021134051524.html">Narendra Modi</a>, whose Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/bharatiya-janata-party-141021133433876.html">BJP</a>) has campaigned on promises to build a Hindu temple in place of a medieval-era mosque, called for calm.</p>
      <p>"Whatever decision the Supreme Court arrives at on Ayodhya, it will not be a victory or defeat of anyone," Modi tweeted on Friday.</p>
      <p>"I appeal to the countrymen that all of us prioritise that this decision should further strengthen India's great traditions of peace, unity and goodwill."</p>
      <p>Police and home ministry officials said government agencies were making preparations to thwart any violence.</p>
      <p>"Each and every security officer is committed to prevent minor skirmishes or large-scale riots after the court delivers its verdict," said a senior home ministry official in New Delhi.</p>
      <p>"State governments have identified several schools to set up temporary jails if the need arises," said the official, who declined to be identified.</p>
      <p>Hindu groups say the site should be restored to Hindus in keeping with their sentiments while Muslims and secularists say the destruction of the mosque was a dangerous step towards empowering a violent nationalist mob.</p>
      <p>Provincial police chief Om Prakash Singh told Reuters that precautionary measures were in place and <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/social-media.html">social media</a> platforms were being monitored to track inflammatory posts before the verdict.</p>
      <p>"We will not tolerate Hindus or Muslims publicly displaying their reaction to the court verdict," Singh said.</p>
      <p>Additional vehicles, CCTV cameras, body cameras and drones, too, have been brought in," Ayodhya police senior superintendent Ashish Tiwari told the AFP on Wednesday.</p>
      <h3>'No repeat of the 1992 communal violence'</h3>
      <p>Muslim religious leaders have called for peace and appealed Muslims to respect court judgment in Friday sermons in many parts of the country.</p>
      <p>Navaid Hamid, president of the All India Muslim Majlis-e-Mushawarat, the top forum for Islamic organisations, said thousands of Muslim religious leaders had pledged to maintain peace and harmony after the court verdict.</p>
      <p>"The land can belong to Hindus or Muslims, but there will be no repeat of the 1992 communal violence," said Hamid.</p>
      <p>Ayodhya - considered one of the holiest Hindu sites - is visited by religious pilgrims from all over India throughout the year.</p>
      <p>Around one million pilgrims are expected to be there early next week for a bathing ritual in the Saryu River that flows in the region.</p>
      <p>"We just have to stay alert and sensitive to the security of the visiting pilgrims," Ayodhya district magistrate Anuj Kumar Jha told the AFP.</p>
      <p>"We are also keeping a very close watch on the social media to ensure there are no rumours or incitement."</p>
      <p>Authorities clamped down on movement and assembly of people in the region last month when the court was concluding its hearing into the dispute.</p>
