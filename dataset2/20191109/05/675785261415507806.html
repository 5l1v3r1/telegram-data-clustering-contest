      <p>Caitlyn Jenner has hailed her daughter Kylie as 'a wonderful mum' as she heads to the Australian jungle.</p>
      <p>It is believed that ITV have paid big bucks to land 70-year-old Caitlyn for I'm A Celebrity and she has headed Down Under with praise for her billionaire make-up mogul daughter.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Us Weekly, Caitlyn has shared some thoughts on how Kylie is bringing up her daughter Stormi Webster.</p>
      <p>She told the magazine: "Little Stormi is a wonderful little kid, [and Kylie] is a wonderful mom. She's totally dedicated to her."</p>

      <p>Keeping Up With The Kardashians star Kylie, 22, has the closest bond with Caitlyn and has ensured that she left the family behind on a high note.</p>
      <p>The reality star has been quite vocal ahead of taking her place in the jungle camp.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn has told how she watched in horror as the Woolsey wildfire headed for her home in Malibu, Californian, last year.</p>

      <p>She told the BBC's Don't Tell Me The Score podcast : “We had fires come through here. I stayed about a minute before it hit as it was coming up that canyon so intensely.</p>
      <p>“Tornadoes 200ft in the air of flames coming at you. It was pretty frightening.</p>
      <p>“In the pool, there had to be close to 15 dead rats, 15 dead rabbits. Soot. Everything. The house had to be sanitised. It was a mess. A lot of things on the outside were messed up.”</p>
      <p>At least the rats and rabbits will prove to be a good grounding for the weeks ahead.</p>

      <p>In the podcast, Caitlyn said the fire did £240,000 of damage to the house she shares with girlfriend, Sophia Hutchins, 23, and dogs, Bertha and Baxter.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn’s £500,000 I’m A Celebrity fee is the show’s biggest yet and will go some way to help repair her Californian home.</p>
