        <b>Middle-order batsman Andrew Balbirnie will take over the reins from William Porterfield as Ireland's new Test and ODI captain, Cricket Ireland confirmed on Friday. Balbirnie, who made his international debut for Ireland almost a decade ago, also led the Irish team at the 2010 Under-19 World Cup.</b>
      </p>
      <p>After being the nucleus of Ireland's revolution in international cricket, William Porterfield, who led the country in 253 matches spanning over 11 years, has finally decided to call it a day as the national team's captain. Cricket Ireland have confirmed that 28-year-old Andrew Balbirnie will be taking over the reins from Porterfield with immediate effect.</p>
      <p>Balbirnie, who made his international debut way back in 2010, also has prior experience in leading the country, having led them previously in the 2010 U-19 World Cup. The 28-year-old, who has represented Ireland in 104 international matches till date, expressed his excitement in taking over as Ireland's Test and ODI captain and also paid tribute to Porterfield, who has been the backbone of the country for more than a decade. </p>
      <p>"To be asked to captain my country is an absolute honour and one that I am very excited about as we move into a busy new year. It's a proud moment not just for me but also for my family and everyone who has been there on my cricket journey so far - especially my coaches, teammates and friends at Pembroke Cricket Club," Balbirnie said in an official statement, reported Cricbuzz.</p>
      <p>"Since 2008 William [Porterfield] has been an amazing leader on and off the field, not just to me but anyone who has been lucky to represent Ireland. Taking over from our greatest captain will certainly be a hard act to follow but one I'm looking forward to getting into. William still has a huge role to play in this team going forward and I look forward to working with him over the next couple of years," he added.</p>
      <p>Porterfield, who is 35 now, feels that with age not on his side and with the ODI league soon approaching, this was the perfect time to hand over the leadership role to a rather young Balbirnie to take the team forward. He also lauded the selectors for making a shrewd choice in appointing Balbirnie and said that he will mentor and guide the 28-year-old in every way possible to help him adapt to his new role as captain. Porterfield further reflected on his tenure as Ireland captain and stated that he was 'lucky' and 'privileged' to have been able to lead the side for over a decade.</p>
      <p>"I feel, and in consultation with Cricket Ireland, that now is the right time to hand over that mantle. With the ODI league starting in the summer it will allow Balbo time to get into the swing of things. I feel that the selectors have made a great choice in appointing Balbo and that it has come at a great time for him personally being on top of his game, and with more to come. Having spoken to him, I know how honoured and excited he is to get going. I'm looking forward to helping and supporting Balbo in any way I can, and seeing him lead Ireland forward," said Porterfield.</p>
      <p>"It has been an incredible journey, and a fantastic honour to have captained my country over the past 11 and a half years. There have been many highs, along with a few lows along the way, but I can honestly say that it has been thoroughly enjoyable. To have been able to lead Ireland out at various World Cups, through to our first Test against Pakistan, and again at Lord's in the summer, have been but a few of these highlights. I feel incredibly lucky and privileged to have done so."</p>
