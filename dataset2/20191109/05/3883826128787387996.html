        <b>India's Supreme Court is due to make a long-awaited ruling on a disputed religious site in the northern holy city of Ayodhya.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hindus and Muslims have for decades been bitterly divided over the 16th Century Babri mosque site.</p>
      <p>The judges' decision is due shortly and is said to be unanimous.</p>
      <p>Officials have appealed for calm, and thousands of police and paramilitary troops have been deployed in the city in Uttar Pradesh state.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of people were detained on Friday amid fears of violence.</p>
      <p>The court case centres on the ownership of the land and has been dragging on in the Supreme Court for years.</p>
      <p>Hindus believe that the site of the mosque is the birthplace of one of their most revered deities, Lord Ram, and they want to build a temple there. Muslims, however, say they have worshipped there for generations.</p>
      <p>Schools and colleges in the area have been closed and all roads leading to the site have been blocked by police.</p>
      <p>Government departments say they have also made preparations to deal with any violence.</p>

      <p>"Each and every security officer is committed to prevent minor skirmishes or large-scale riots after the court delivers its verdict," said one senior home ministry official, who declined to be named.</p>
      <p>"State governments have identified several schools to set up temporary jails if the need arises."</p>
      <p>On Twitter, Prime Minister Narendra Modi appealed for calm and urged everyone to respect the verdict.</p>
      <p>"Whatever the verdict... it won't be anybody's win or loss," he said.</p>
      <p>"My appeal to the people of India is that our priority is to ensure the verdict strengthens the values of peace, equality and goodwill of our country."</p>
      <h3>What is the dispute about?</h3>
      <p>At the centre of the row is the 16th Century mosque that was demolished by Hindu mobs in 1992, sparking riots that killed nearly 2,000 people.</p>
      <p>Many Hindus believe that the Babri Masjid was constructed on the ruins of a Hindu temple that was demolished by Muslim invaders.</p>
      <p>Muslims say they offered prayers at the mosque until December 1949 when some Hindus placed an idol of Ram in the mosque and began to worship the idols.</p>
      <p>Over the decades since, the two religious groups have gone to court many times over who should control the site.</p>
      <p>Since then, there have been calls to build a temple on the spot where the mosque once stood.</p>
      <p>Hinduism is India's majority religion and is thought to be more than 4,000 years old. India's first Islamic dynasty was established in the early 13th Century.</p>
      <h3>Who is fighting the case?</h3>
      <p>The long and complicated property dispute has been dragging on in various courts for more than a century.</p>
      <p>This particular case is being fought between three main parties - two Hindu groups and the Muslim Waqf Board, which is responsible for the maintenance of Islamic properties in India.</p>
      <p>The Hindu litigants are the Hindu Mahasabha, a right-wing political party, and the Nirmohi Akhara, which is a sect of Hindu monks.</p>

      <p>They filed a title dispute in the Allahabad High Court in 2002, a decade after the mosque was demolished.</p>
      <p>A verdict in that case was pronounced in September 2010 - it determined that the 2.77 acres of the disputed land would be divided equally into three parts.</p>
      <p>The court ruled that the site should be split, with the Muslim community getting control of a third, Hindus another third and the Nirmohi Akhara sect the remainder. Control of the main disputed section, where the mosque once stood, was given to Hindus.</p>
      <p>The judgement also made three key observations.</p>
      <p>It affirmed the disputed spot was the birthplace of Lord Ram, that the Babri Masjid was built after the demolition of a Hindu temple, and that the mosque was not built in accordance with the tenets of Islam.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court suspended this ruling in 2011 after both Hindu and Muslim groups appealed against it.</p>
