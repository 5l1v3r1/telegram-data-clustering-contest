      <h1>Ayodhya case: Underlying structure was not an Islamic, says Supreme Court</h1>
      <h2>The faith of the Hindus that Lord Ram was born at the demolished structure is undisputed, the apex court said</h2>

      <p>The Supreme Court on Saturday said the underlying structure below the disputed site at Ayodhya was not an Islamic structure, but the ASI has not established whether a temple was demolished to build a mosque.</p>
      <p>The observation by a 5-judge Constitution bench, headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, was made in its verdict in the politically sensitive case of Ram Janmbhoomi-Babri Masjid land dispute in Ayodhya.</p>
      <p>The bench, also comprising Justices S A Bobde, D Y Chandrachud, Ashok Bhushan and S Abdul Nazeer, further said that terming the archeological evidence as merely an opinion would be a great disservice to the Archaeological Survey of India.</p>
      <p>The court also said that the Hindus consider the disputed site as the birthplace of Lord Ram and even Muslims say this about that place.<br/> </p>

      <p>The faith of the Hindus that Lord Ram was born at the demolished structure is undisputed, the apex court said.</p>
      <p>The bench said the existence of Sita Rasoi, Ram Chabutra and Bhandar grih are the testimony of the religious fact of the place.</p>
      <p>The apex court, however, said that the title cannot be established on the ground of faith, belief and they are only an indicator for deciding the dispute.</p>
