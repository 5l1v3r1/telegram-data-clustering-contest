      <h1>Important reason why you should never keep your savings in your current account</h1>
      <h2>Almost a quarter of Brits use a current account as their savings account, but what should you be doing instead? These are the risks - and what you can do about it</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T05:00:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author">Emma Munbodh, https://www.facebook.com/EmmaMunbodh</a></address>
      <p>It's no secret that interest rates on traditional savings accounts have tumbled in recent years - leaving millions of savers scrambling to find a good return - if any at all.</p>
      <p>Right now, the best <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/best-savings-rates-easy-access-6576929">easy-access account</a> in the market pays a woeful 1.46% - with lenders reserving their biggest rewards for those willing to part with their cash for three to five years.</p>
      <p>And so a natural reaction to the problem has been for savers to stop putting money away altogether - with many choosing to leave their cash mounting up in their current accounts, instead.</p>
      <p>The good news is that some of these accounts pay interest - but the bad news is that it can cost you every penny you have.</p>
      <p>In the UK, your savings are <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/who-actually-owns-your-bank-18860943">only protected up to £85,000 per banking group, not bank</a>.</p>
      <p>If you exceed this limit in your current account, you face losing out if your bank collapses, essentially because you're not insured.</p>
      <p>Then there's the fraud risk.</p>

      <p>Having all of your money squirrelled away in the same account means easy access for fraudsters who successfully target you.</p>
      <p>Once they access your pin number, card or online banking details, they'll get free rein to every penny you have.</p>
      <p>Then there's the savings mistake. Interest rates may be dismal right now, but the worst thing you can do is earn nothing at all.</p>
      <p>According to Ford Money, 41% of savers are stuck in a 'nightmare' when it comes to saving, with the most common pitfall being using their current accounts as savings accounts.</p>
      <p>Almost a quarter use a current account as their savings account and 15% say they simply "do not know what else to do".</p>
      <p>"While it’s an easy habit to slip into, many people are not aware of the risks saving into your current account can bring. For example, doing so can increase your vulnerability to fraud," Suzanne Lewsley, chief deposits officer at Ford Money said.</p>
      <p>"With UK Finance reporting a 16% increase in financial fraud since 2017, it can heavily impact those who keep all their money in one pot. Moreover, storing hard earned cash in one place also prevents you from reaping the benefits of interest rates.</p>
      <p>“Savers can make their money more secure and benefit from interest by opening a savings account. Easy access savers give you quick access to your money without any withdrawal fees, while a fixed cash ISA allows you to take advantage of tax-free interest while setting aside some money for an extended period.</p>
      <p>"Once you've got one open, setting up a standing order between your current and savings accounts is a great way to ensure you regularly move your money around and save, without having to remember to do it – whether it is as little as £5 a month, a little goes a long way."</p>
