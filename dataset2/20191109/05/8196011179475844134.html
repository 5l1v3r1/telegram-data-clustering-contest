      <p>Cavan native Leanne Kiernan is blending right in as part of West Ham United’s foreign legion.</p>
      <p>The Cavan native 20-year-old Ireland women’s international is now in her second season at the English top-flight outfit which has developed a policy of recruiting from abroad.</p>
      <p>An insight into the club’s approach was revealed earlier this year in a behind-the-scenes television documentary featuring Jack Sullivan, son of the club’s co-owner David Sullivan.</p>
      <p>Snaffling bargains from overseas represents the value-for-money option, as evidenced by an early move for Cavan native Kiernan.</p>
      <p>The striker had just broken into the Ireland senior team on the back of her hat-trick in the FAI Cup final and was attracting interest from various football powerhouses.</p>
      <p>Relocating from the rural setting of her family pig farm in Bailieborough to the bright lights of London was a challenge for Kiernan, but it’s one she wasn’t meeting alone.</p>
      <p>“Only two of the players in our squad are English; the rest of us are foreign,” she says, back home preparing for Tuesday’s trip with Ireland to Greece.</p>
      <p>“This is my second year at the club and our manager Matt Beard strengthened the squad in pre-season with a lot of additions from abroad.</p>
      <p>“Now we have German, Dutch, French, Norwegian, Canadian, and American players. The captain of South Korea, Cho So-hyun, is also with us.</p>
      <p>“I live with three of them, including the American goalkeeper Courtney Brosnan, who plays for Ireland.</p>
      <p>“It was difficult moving away from home so young because everything was done by my family.</p>
      <p>“I had to catch up with learning to cook, but am well used to it now.</p>
      <p>“I’ve made lots of lifelong friends. It’s great craic, as we definitely have the best banter.</p>
      <p>“We don’t really discuss football at home, much preferring to relax by going for coffee and a piece of cake.</p>
      <p>“We are not in the rush of London City, which for someone like me coming from Cavan, is nice.</p>
      <p>“I’ve my car over there, so I can potter around the place and drive towards the country.”</p>
      <p>Along those journeys, Kiernan’s mind could wander into her first real challenge at international level.</p>
      <p>Although she was the star of Colin Bell’s side in the last campaign, breaking into the side as his main striker, new boss Vera Pauw last month caused a surprise by dropping her for the crunch Euro qualifier against Ukraine.</p>
      <p>She had no reason to complain as her replacement Rianna Jarrett scored one and created another in the 3-2 victory over the group’s second seeds.</p>
      <p>Given the Hammers star’s ability to occupy a wing role, she could return to the starting line-up in Tuesday’s third qualifier of the campaign in Greece.</p>
      <p>Ireland will be favourites to rack of their third win of the campaign on the spin and so chart a course for at least a play-off in their bid to reach the 2021 finals.</p>
      <p>“Vera made the right decision to start Rianna in the last game,” Kiernan said of the trip to Athens.</p>
      <p>“I came on in the second half and Vera called me up afterwards.</p>
      <p>“She said the intention was to bring me on for Rianna at half time and I said: ‘Why would you take her off when she was doing so well?’</p>
      <blockquote>We need to beat Greece to qualify and I’d be willing to play anywhere — even in goal!</blockquote>
      <p>“This is our best chance of becoming the first Ireland team to qualify for a major tournament.</p>
      <p>“People are on about Germany hammering everybody in the group, but realistically, that’s not the point.</p>
      <p>“The bigger picture is us having to beat Greece, Ukraine and Montenegro.</p>
      <p>“If we don’t get goals and wins against them, then everything else is irrelevant, as we won’t qualify.”</p>
