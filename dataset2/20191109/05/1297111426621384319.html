      <h1>Former Pats star Colten Teubert came to Regina as a kid and returned as a man</h1>
      <h2>Former Regina Pats star Colten Teubert returned to the Brandt Centre on Friday for his bobblehead night against the Swift Current Broncos.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T05:12:50+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 05:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/gregharderlp" target="_blank">Greg Harder</a></address>
      <p>Colten Teubert has grown up.</p>
      <p>The former Regina Pats captain was a big kid with a blue-chip pedigree when he arrived nearly 15 years ago as the No. 1 pick in the 2005 WHL bantam draft.</p>
      <p>In time, Teubert evolved from a quiet rookie into a fun-loving, outspoken veteran with a larger-than-life personality. The 6-foot-4, 200-pound defenceman wore his heart on his sleeve and took no prisoners on the ice — traits that endeared him to teammates and fans, but also got him in trouble.</p>
      <p>As he reflects on those days, Teubert is grateful for the hard lessons that helped send him down the path of “becoming a man.” He still cherishes his four seasons in Regina and is proud to call the city his “second home.”</p>

      <p>“I always called Regina my home,” said Teubert, who returned for his bobblehead night at the Brandt Centre on Friday. “I’m really excited to be back and show my family — my wife (Ashley), my kids (Greyson, six, and Layli, four).</p>
      <p>“When I talk about Regina, it’s a lot about the relationships that I made along the way and growing and learning. I’m just happy to be back and put the Pats’ logo on again and represent what this storied franchise is all about: Developing human beings and good hockey players. I think they did a good job with me.”</p>
      <p>Although he had some great times in Regina, Teubert’s junior career ended after two difficult seasons in which the team failed to meet expectations despite having three superstar players on the roster: Teubert, Jordan Weal and Jordan Eberle.</p>
      <p>The fans expressed their frustration and Teubert eventually responded, telling the Leader-Post that he didn’t care about being booed by “some fat guy eating popcorn.” He later added: “To be honest, they can do whatever they want and be negative. Our attitude is, we win and lose as a team. We also keep each other accountable but in a respectful way and a way that a team and a family should.”</p>
      <p>Teubert got his message across, but he now realizes he could have done it a different way.</p>
      <p>“I owe a few people some apologies,” he said with a smile. “At the end of the day, I’m a big man. I can say I’m sorry. Learning through that is something that turned me into the family man I am now. It’s something that I look back on. It’s all part of the journey and learning (from mistakes) is something we should constantly do throughout life. I’m still learning.”</p>
      <p>Teubert started a new job this year as the hockey director for Whatcom Sports and Recreation in Bellingham, Wash. He wears about “10 different hats” but the main one is the head-coaching position with the junior A Bellingham Blazers.</p>
      <p>As the face of the program, Teubert is applying the lessons he learned in Regina, one of them being “don’t say what’s on your mind right away (because) that goes on the front page of the newspaper,” he said with a laugh. “I’m a competitive guy and I’m always all-in with everything I do in life and I’m emotional too. Sometimes I speak before I think. Just being composed and being mature (is important) and saying the right things to represent the program. That’s something I’m trying to do down in Bellingham now.”</p>
      <p>Spoken like a true grownup.</p>
      <p>“I made a few mistakes (in the past) but I learned from them,” continued the 29-year-old rookie bench boss. “I’m in a position now where I’m proud of who I am and I’m able to help guys and teach them, ‘Hey, take a breath, calm down, listen to your teachers, listen to the people trying to help you right in front of you.’ That’s just something I learned becoming a man.”</p>

      <p>Following his graduation from the Pats, Teubert — the 13<sup>th</sup> overall pick in the 2008 NHL draft — spent eight seasons in the pros, including 24 games with the Edmonton Oilers in 2011-12. His last four seasons were in Germany, which is when health issues brought a premature end to his playing career.</p>
      <p>While Teubert was rehabbing from back surgery in 2017, his wife began to experience mysterious headaches. A subsequent MRI revealed a brain tumour.</p>
      <p>She underwent successful surgery and, little by little, has been getting back to a normal life.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Teubert’s own accumulation of injuries — combined with his wife’s health — prompted him to make a permanent career change.</p>
      <p>“The way I used to play the game, there was just no way I was going to go back and do that to my body,” he said, reciting a laundry list of serious injuries to his shoulders, knees, ankles and wrists — not to mention eight screws and two plates in his cheek and nine screws in his jaw — along with four broken noses and multiple concussions.</p>
      <p>“All these things add up. With where I had to be as the head of the household, it just wasn’t going to work. The pro lifestyle is a young man’s game or a healthy man’s game. At the time we just didn’t have that health in our family. I had to walk away. I’ve got it in my mind and my heart (that he could still play) but my body doesn’t work like that anymore.”</p>
      <p>Although Teubert’s pro career didn’t go exactly as planned, he never gave up on the NHL. While in Europe, he was angling for the right opportunity to come back to North America.</p>
      <p>“I was playing real good hockey in Germany,” he said. “I was a local favourite. In Iserlohn, people would grow Fu Manchu mustaches and they’d stop me at red lights: ‘Toyburt! Toyburt!’ In Nuermberg, I still have fans message me every other day telling me they miss me. I was just that type of player that the blue-collar guy related to. I wasn’t the fanciest guy but I put the team first and sacrificed my body for the team. Whatever it took to win.”</p>

      <p>That mindset helped Teubert win two medals with Canada at the world junior championship: Gold in 2009 and silver in 2010. He also won an East Division pennant with Regina in 2008.</p>
      <p>“I’m not the guy who wears my gold medals or my rings around, but I do like to show my players ‘if you put the work in, this is where you can get to.’ ” he said. “I’m a pretty humble guy now. They grab strength from that because that’s someone you can follow.”</p>
      <p>Teubert always had natural leadership qualities but he can also relate to today’s players and the pressures of the game. He arrived in Regina with the burden of great expectations and, like most kids, there were times when he didn’t handle it well.</p>
      <p>“There was tons of pressure,” he said. “I fought Chris Cloud (of the Saskatoon Blades) my first shift, 16 years old, beat him up and the next day in the paper it’s ‘Teubert Terrific!’ When you’re a young guy at 16, you don’t realize there’s all that pressure. You let things get to your head. You let some of that negative ‘I’m-better-than-the-rest-of-you’ (attitude) grow inside you.”</p>
      <p>Ultimately, the game has a way of humbling even the best players. Those experiences have given Teubert a unique perspective as a coach, which he believes is his “natural calling.”</p>
      <p>He’s not sure where it’ll take him, but he’s excited about the journey.</p>
      <p>“I believe I was meant to be a coach,” he added. “When I was two years old I had a dream to win the Stanley Cup. I now realize I have a chance again. I can either win a Stanley Cup by helping a player get there or, who knows, maybe I can find my way back to the NHL.</p>
      <p>“My goal is still to win a Stanley Cup.”</p>
