        <b>Legendary wicket-keeper batsman Kumar Sangakkara believes that heading forward, it's important for Rishabh Pant to stick to the basics, understand his weaknesses and work on them. Sangakkara also stated that heading into the World T20, Pant needs to exactly know what his role in the team will be.</b>
      </p>
      <p>After seeing his place in the Test side snatched away by a much older <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/wriddhiman_saha">Wriddhiman Saha</a>, <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/rishabh_pant">Rishabh </a><a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/pant">Pant</a> had the perfect opportunity to stamp his authority in the limited-overs side heading into the T20Is against Bangladesh, especially with <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/sanju_samson">Sanju Samson</a> lurking on the sidelines. But the youngster did little to enhance his withering reputation as after failing with the bat in the first T20I, Pant had a horror show behind the stumps in the second, botching an easy stumping whilst also being sloppy with gathering the ball.Â </p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, the youngster became the talk of the town and was subject to a lot of criticism - both during and after the match - and many felt that it might be time for team India to drop the Delhite. However, one person who still has faith in Pant is legendary Sri Lankan keeper <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/kumar_sangakkara">Kumar Sangakkara</a>, who believes that it is important for Pant to just stick to the basics, understand what his weaknesses are and then work on them.</p>
      <p>"It's important for him to keep things simple and understand his weakness. Once he is able to work on these areas he needs to strategize and plan, because for him right now he needs to keep things simple and not be under pressure," Sangakkara told Star Sports, reported News18.</p>
      <p>"It's also important for someone to talk to him on his batting and keep him off the pressure and let him be free with his game," he added.</p>
      <p>With Pant unsure of his role in the team right now, Sangakkara believes that heading into the WT20 next year, it is important for the youngster to be crystal clear on what his role in the team is. Pant has also been off-colour with respect to DRS in the series, but Sangakkara feels that it's nothing but a confidence issue and believes that better decision-making is something that will automatically follow Pant once he shows solidity with the gloves.</p>
      <p>"If you are looking at the World Cup it's important for him (Pant) to understand what his role is in terms of helping his captain with the right information," opined Sangakkara.</p>
      <p>"However, at the same time as a wicketkeeper, it's important to be neat and tidy behind the stumps which will give him confidence and put him in a better position to help his captain in calling for reviews."</p>
