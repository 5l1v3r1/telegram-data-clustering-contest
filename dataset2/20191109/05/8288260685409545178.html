      <h1>More than 6 million illegal cigarettes raided over the last year by trading standards</h1>
      <h2>Local authority trading standards say they discovered more than 6m illegal cigarettes</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T05:30:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 05:30</time> by <a rel="author">Charlotte Regen, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/charlotte-regen/</a></address>
      <p>Last year more than six million illegal cigarettes and 350kg of hand rolling tobacco were seized by local authority trading standards services across the West Midlands region.</p>
      <p>Officers have stated the big success behind busting illegal sales of tobacco were achieved despite ingenious efforts to hide them.</p>
      <p>Traders used sophisticated ways of hiding the illegal goods, such as electronic magnets controlled by a switch as well as hydraulic compartments in floors and cavity wall compartments, in a desperate bid to avoid detection by trading standards.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Such hiding places are difficult for the authorities to detect without the aid of specialist tobacco sniffer dogs.   </p>
      <p>The cigarettes, along with the hand rolling tobacco, were confiscated by officers during the 2018/2019 financial year and had an estimated street value of nearly £1.3 million.</p>
      <p>The goods were either counterfeit or smuggled to avoid tax, but would have been worth in excess of £3.3 million if they had been genuine UK duty paid goods. The loss to the tax payer is in excess of £1.9 million.</p>
      <p>All businesses caught with illegal cigarettes or tobacco are subject to criminal investigation, with some traders already being successfully prosecuted.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Some have received custodial sentences, others have received suspended prison sentences and community orders. Financial penalties have also been ordered, including Proceeds of Crime confiscations of over £150,000.</p>
      <p>In addition, some businesses have had closure orders granted against them and those who have an alcohol licence have had their alcohol licences suspended or revoked.</p>
      <p>Councillor Farut Shaeen, Sandwell Council's cabinet member for living health lives, said: "It's important that communities support efforts to crack down on illegal cigarettes.</p>
      <p>"Far from being a victimless crime, the trade in illegal tobacco creates a cheap source for children and young people."</p>
