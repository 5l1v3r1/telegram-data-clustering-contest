      <p>A ‘heartbroken’ granddaughter of a 91-year-old OAP targeted in a distraction burglary has urged the public to help police catch those responsible.</p>
      <p>Police say two women made repeated attempts to get the elderly Eachelhurst Road resident in Walmley, Sutton Coldfield, to answer her door at around 5.30pm on Wednesday (November 6).</p>
      <p>On the third attempt the pensioner let the women in her home – only for money to be stolen from her purse before the women left.</p>
      <p>The granddaughter of the 91-year-old victim, who asked not to be named, said: “I am devastated and heartbroken. It’s disgusting. These people must be inhuman to do this to target a woman of this age.</p>

      <p>“These two ladies approached my nan’s house and came up the drive and tried knocking on the door. Then they left. They came back again and went again.</p>
      <p>“The third time they came back they were hammering on the door. They were laughing and acting cool and collected. They were making jokes and adjusting their scarves.</p>
      <p>“You can see it all on my nan’s Nest camera footage.</p>
      <p>“Then my nan answered the and you can hear her say ‘not today’.</p>
      <p>“But they carry on and she lets them in the house.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The upset 32-year-old added: “Family members visit my nan every day. We found out that the women have taken money from my nan’s purse.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know what happened when they went in the house and I don’t want anyone else to go through it.</p>
      <p>“My nan has lived in Sutton all her life and in that house for years and years</p>
      <p>“It just goes to show what kind of low lives they are to do this to her.”</p>
      <p>West Midlands Police confirmed they are investigating the incident.</p>
