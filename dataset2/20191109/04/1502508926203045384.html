      <h1>Facebook apologises after black workers complain of bias, hostile culture</h1>
      <h2>Anonymous post alleges perceived slights managers, white colleagues, and HR department at Facebook.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T04:27:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 04:27</time> by <a rel="author">AFP | Press Trust of India</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/facebook">Facebook </a>apologised on Friday after black employees anonymously shared feelings of workplace bias in an online post.</p>
      <p>The post shared at Medium by a "FB Blind" profile laid out perceived slights by managers, white colleagues, and the human resources department.</p>
      <p>"No one at Facebook, or anywhere, should have to put up with this behavior," corporate communications vice president Bertie Thomson said in response to an AFP query.</p>
      <p>"We are sorry. It goes against everything that we stand for as a company. We're listening and working hard to do better." Incidents described in the Medium post included being targeted for negative performance reviews or snide comments.</p>
      <p>"On the inside, we are sad. Angry. Oppressed. Depressed," the post read.</p>
      <p>"And treated every day through the micro and macro aggressions as if we do not belong here." The anonymous post maintained that the atmosphere at <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/facebook">Facebook </a>has worsened in the past year when it came to non-white workers being recognised, empowered and treated equitably.</p>
      <p>"The problem is not just with black employees of different genders," the post read.</p>
      <p>"We are remaining anonymous because <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/facebook">Facebook </a>creates a hostile culture where anyone that is non-white is made to feel fear for their job and their safety to report any bad behaviors."</p>
