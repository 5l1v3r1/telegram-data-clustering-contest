      <p>MUMBAI: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Satwiksairaj-Rankireddy">Satwiksairaj Rankireddy</a> and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Chirag-Shetty">Chirag Shetty</a> have been making waves with their consistent performance and coach <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Uday-Pawar">Uday Pawar</a>, who had initially trained Shetty, says he is not at all surprised that they are doing well.</p>
      <p>“They are young and competitive and the success has done them a world of good. I am happy that they are hungry for more success as that shows they are not basking in recent glory. Staying grounded is very important and these two boys have shown that with their recent performances.”</p>
      <p>Pawar believes they are capable of maintaining the consistency in the coming months. “Among the top doubles teams, they have beaten almost every pair barring the Indonesian and the Japanese duos. They are very quick teams and they keep the Indian pair on the defence with their speed.</p>
      <p>“And the Indian pair’s defence is not their strong point. Reddy and Shetty have played to their strength which is aggression against other teams. Though they lost to the Indonesian and Japanese pairs recently, both the matches were very close.”</p>
      <p>Pawar says he always expected the Indian pair to progress smoothly. “But the way they have done it, the rankings they have achieved is even better than my expectation. They have shown the kind of consistency that top five in the world show.</p>
      <p>“At their level to be this consistent, normally it takes a long time to achieve that. They have done this in a short period of three years and it gives rise to the hope that they will be the top combination very soon.” The Chirag-Satwik pair had reached the final of the French Open last month.</p>
