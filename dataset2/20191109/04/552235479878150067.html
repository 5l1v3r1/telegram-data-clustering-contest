      <p>A man threatened to jump from a motorway bridge after his former partner took away his <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/east-kilbride-gamer-wins-50k-18800951">Xbox</a> and internet router.</p>
      <p>Remi Alston, 26, pleaded guilty to causing a public nuisance after he caused the shutdown of the M56 for four hours as police tried to talk him down.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/shocking-moment-bikers-lead-police-20839932">Police</a> in Greater Manchester said the incident ‘had a severe effect on already drained police resources on a busy Saturday night’.</p>
      <p>Alston, who was said to have ‘mental health issues’, eventually came down voluntarily in the early hours of April 7 this year.</p>
      <p>Manchester Crown <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/paisley-wife-beater-missed-court-20832264">Court</a> heard that 12 police officers, two negotiators, and other emergency service professionals were called out to the bridge in the Wythenshawe area of the city.</p>

      <p>The court heard he previously received a suspended sentence for a similar incident on Barton Swing Bridge last year.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Gavin Howie said that Alston had returned to his home to find his Xbox and other electrical items were missing, and he blamed his ex-partner.</p>
      <p>He went to the bridge because he “wanted to hurt himself” but said he didn’t intend to commit suicide.</p>
      <p>Police were called at about 1.30am and said he would ‘stay there even if it took three days’.</p>
      <p>At about 4.50am, his ex arrived at the scene with a wireless router and Alston came down shortly after.</p>
      <p>When he was arrested, Alston said he was ‘sick of the mickey being taken out of him’.</p>
      <p>Defending, Robert Lancaster said that Alston has suffered from long standing mental health problems, and said he his client suffered from a ‘borderline personality disorder’ which can cause him to have ‘extreme reactions’.</p>

      <p>Judge Suzanne Goddard QC said that Alston’s culpability was ‘significantly affected’ by his mental health issues, and passed a 15 month prison sentence, suspended for two years.</p>
      <p>The judge told Alston: “It is self evident that it must have caused disruption to a large number of people, who were prevented from going about their lawful and usual business.”</p>
      <p>Alston, from Eccles, was also ordered to complete 15 rehabilitation activity requirement days, and a 12 month alcohol treatment program.</p>
