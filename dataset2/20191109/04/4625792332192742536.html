      <p>Users across social media put aside their political differences for an evening to unite in dismay after watching a teenage girl awkwardly perform a "Make America Great Again" rap as part of a #MAGAchallenge to make pro-Trump videos.</p>
      <p>The teenage girl's entry, in which she donned a Trump campaign tee and swayed back and forth in front of an American flag, featured lyrics that seldom rhymed and caused viewers to question their meaning.</p>
      <p>"How dare you? How dare you spread truth with your ego?" she questioned liberal opposition at one point. "But the truth is where we go," she said in response.</p>

      <p>Commenters from across the political spectrum bemoaned the lyrics and haphazard rhythm but noted that the song would likely worm its way into their heads.</p>
      <p>"I'm honestly mad cuz I'ma have 'I'm a MAGA kid, I'm a MAGA kid' and 'in god we trust, MAGA kids fight' in my head. Also that non stop nervous sway back and forth is just toooo much," journalist Amir Talai said.</p>

      <p>Some noted that the video was "cringworthy" and more than a little awkward.</p>
      <p>"Did anyone else start sweating when they watched this? I felt so uncomfortable ... for her," one Twitter user wrote.</p>
