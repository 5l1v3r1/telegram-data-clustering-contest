      <p>Robert Bowers is accused of opening fire <a href="https://www.wpxi.com/news/top-stories/tree-of-life-shooting-alleged-shooter-won-t-get-to-see-sensitive-info-from-tree-of-life-shooting/1006550805">inside</a> the synagogue in Pittsburgh on Oct. 27, 2018, and killing 11 people inside.</p>
      <p>The judge's ruling will prevent him from seeing autopsy photos, 911 calls from the victims, and other <a href="https://www.wpxi.com/news/top-stories/tree-of-life-shooting-alleged-shooter-won-t-get-to-see-sensitive-info-from-tree-of-life-shooting/1006550805">information</a>. </p>
      <p>His defense team, however, will have access to the information on two separate hard drives - one in Pittsburgh and another in San Diego, where the lawyers are based.</p>
      <p>The judge's ruling allows for Bowers to review the information with his team ahead of the trial if it is going to be used as <a href="https://www.wpxi.com/news/top-stories/tree-of-life-shooting-alleged-shooter-won-t-get-to-see-sensitive-info-from-tree-of-life-shooting/1006550805">evidence</a>.</p>
      <p>A trial date has still not been set, but also this week the judge extended the window for pretrial motions until April 2020.</p>
