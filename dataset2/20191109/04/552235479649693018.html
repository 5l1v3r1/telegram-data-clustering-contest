      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T04:30:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Charlie Gall, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/charlie-gall/</a></address>
      <p>The victim of an alleged hit-and-run road rage attack has blasted <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/shocking-moment-bikers-lead-police-20839932">police</a> for failing to snare the perpetrator after six months.</p>
      <p>Deborah Jenkinson, 48, was left battered and traumatised after another <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/young-boy-airlifted-hospital-after-20843674">driver</a> rammed her and sped off.</p>
      <p>The mum relived her ordeal triggered by a parking row in Mill Lane, Leith, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/police-want-speak-man-over-20839361">Edinburgh</a> on May 7 this year.</p>
      <p>Carer Deborah said her terrified 11-year-old son and mum, 71, watched horrified she was hit by the fleeing driver.</p>
      <p>Speaking in support of Road Safety Awareness Week, Deborah claimed: “The police have now closed the case because they can’t find the man who did this.</p>
      <p>“I’d parked up to let my mum go into the doctors. It’s a small street so everyone bumps onto the pavement to let traffic pass.</p>

      <p>“There was a car sitting in the middle of the road so I beeped the horn to get the driver to move over a bit to let us pass.</p>
      <p>“But the young man in his 30s ignored me. My mum put the window down to ask him to shut his door when he started shouting awful verbal abuse at me.</p>
      <p>“I got out to take his registration details and the next part is slightly blank.</p>
      <p>“He put his foot on the accelerator and ran into me.”</p>
      <p>Deborah added: “My son said ‘Mummy was there one minute and not the next,’ and another witness said I pirouetted.</p>
      <p>“It all happened because of road rage.”</p>
      <p>Deborah suffered lasting injuries her right arm, sciatica, numbness, back pain and psychological distress.</p>
      <p>Her mum and son were also left traumatised witnessing the incident.</p>
      <p>Deborah is now seeking legal advice and a personal injury claim through Watermans Solicitors.</p>
      <p>She said: “It’s been outrageous from start to finish.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>“The police have closed the case as they haven’t been able to find the person who did this.</p>
      <p>“The driver could have killed me through road rage. I don’t like to even think about it because it just gets me angry.</p>
      <p>“I’m just disgusted that this man hasn’t been caught yet. I could have been killed.”</p>
      <p>Solicitor Stacey Moore, of Watermans, said: “This is an unusual case in which the consequences for our client could have been catastrophic.</p>
      <p>“It was terribly distressing for everyone involved and I’m pleased we’ve been able to assist Deborah with support and rehabilitation during the claims process.”</p>
      <p>Police Scotland insisted their inquiries into the incident were continuing.</p>
