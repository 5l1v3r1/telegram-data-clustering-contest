      <h1>Boeing's Poor Information Security Threatens Passenger Safety, National Security, Says Researcher</h1>

      <p><a href="https://tech.slashdot.org/~itwbennett">itwbennett</a> writes: <i>Security researcher Chris Kubecka has identified (and reported to Boeing and the Department of Homeland Security back in August) a number of <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3451585/boeings-poor-information-security-posture-threatens-passenger-safety-national-security-researcher-s.html">security vulnerabilities in Boeing's networks, email system, and website</a>. "[T]he company's failure to remedy the security failures she reported demonstrate either an unwillingness or inability to take responsibility for their information security," writes JM Porup for CSO online. <br/><br/>The vulnerabilities include a publicly exposed test developer network, a lack of encryption on the boeing.com website, failure to use DMARC for email security, and, perhaps most notably, an email server infected with malware. <br/><br/>For its part, Boeing says that the vulnerabilities Kubecka reported are "common IT vulnerabilities â€” the type of cyber-hygiene issues thousands of companies confront every day" and that the company has "no indication of a compromise in any aviation system or product that Boeing produces." What Porup's reporting and Kubecka's research clearly shows, however, is how poor information security practices can become aviation security risks.</i></p>
