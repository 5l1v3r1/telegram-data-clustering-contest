      <h1>Rab C Nesbitt set for TV comeback as Gregor Fisher reveals he may don string vest again</h1>
      <h2>Fans of the hit BBC comedy Plans will be thrilled at the news plans for Rab C's return to our screens are being discussed.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T04:30:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">John Dingwall, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/john-dingwall/</a></address>
      <p>He played one of ­Scotland’s best-loved comedy ­characters for almost two decades and has starred with ­Hollywood stars Al Pacino, Richard Burton and John Malkovich.</p>
      <p>Now Gregor Fisher has hinted he is ready to don the string vest once more and return to our screens as street philosopher <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rab-c-nesbitt">Rab C Nesbitt</a>.</p>
      <p>Gregor, 65, says early talks have begun to bring back the finest comic creation of his long and illustrious career.</p>
      <p>Asked if he would return as Rab, he told the <i><b>Daily Record:</b> </i>“Nothing is ever finished until the fat lady sings.</p>
      <p>“There are a lot of people involved in this. The ingredients are being discussed. The cake has not yet been mixed and the oven isn’t lit but we talk. Gently.</p>
      <p>“We want to get this right. I don’t want to barge into this and neither does anybody else. But yes, there’s talk.</p>
      <p>“It’s very gentle talk and if we make it more than that we’ll frighten all parties out of the water. So we don’t want to kill the thing before it happens.”</p>

      <p>The news will delight fans of the series, which co-starred <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/elaine-c-smith">Elaine C Smith</a> as Rab’s long-suffering wife Mary and Tony Roper as his pal Jamesie Cotter.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/bbc">BBC</a> comedy, created by Ian Pattison, ran from 1998 to 2014 but with the end credits having rolled on Still Game, a return of Rab C could be just what the nation needs to lift its spirits.</p>
      <p>Gregor is preparing for a key role in the hit Broadway musical, Dr Seuss’ How The Grinch Stole Christmas at the Festival Theatre in Edinburgh.</p>
      <p>He’ll get to talk about his time as Govan’s booze-swilling ne’er-do-well, his life and career at a special event taking place at Greenock’s Beacon Arts Theatre later this month.</p>
      <p>A Wee Blether With Gregor Fisher on November 23 will see him talk about his ­childhood, his first TV spot ­alongside Rikki Fulton in Scotch &amp; Wry in the late 70s and playing Rab.</p>
      <p>There may be tales from his work with Burton in the film 1984 as well as his roles in Love Actually and the remake of Whisky Galore.</p>

      <p>Gregor, who is still well known for his turn as the Baldy Man in Naked Video and Hamlet’s cigar ads, declared his health is better than ever after a heart scare.</p>
      <p>He said: “My specialist said I’m better than I’ve been for a long time. I said, ‘What do you mean?’</p>
      <p>“He said, ‘You’re in better nick now than you were before the incident and you’ll probably live to get a Queen’s telegram.’</p>
      <p>“I said, ‘It’ll be a king’s telegram because she’ll have slipped away by then.’”</p>
      <p>Appearing with Pacino on the 2004 film The Merchant of Venice made a lasting impressing on him because the Hollywood actor was going through a custody battle at the time.</p>
      <p>Gregor said: “John Sessions and I had to go to Mr Pacino’s private rehearsal room in New York every day. He was spending mornings in court which didn’t bode well for the afternoons.</p>
      <p>“He always used to turn up for lunch, then we’d rehearse. He was a nice guy. He comes from planet Pacino but a lot of these big American stars come from their own planet.</p>

      <p>“He tended to rub your neck a lot before a take and say, ‘Let’s do it. I spent most of the time thinking, ‘What’s all that rubbing about?’”</p>
      <p>Gregor told of the menial jobs he worked at before he was accepted to train as an actor. He said: “I used to make lavatories in Shanks in ­Barrhead when I left school.</p>
      <p>“I thought, ‘I don’t like making lavatories.’ I might have been sacked from Shanks. I was sacked from a few jobs.</p>
      <p>“Then I worked in a chicken farm with 2000 to a shed all in cages. It was dreadful.</p>
      <p>“I had to collect eggs and I had to muck out. You’ve never seen so much chicken s*** in all your life. Then I worked as a grass cutter and I got sacked for sitting down and smoking a cigarette.”</p>
      <p>Recalling how he became an actor, he added: “I muttered words of one syllable to the careers officer and he slapped a syllabus from the Royal ­Scottish Academy of Music and Drama and he said, ‘This is where you need to apply.’</p>
      <p>“I’d done a couple of plays at school and one of the teachers must have thought I could do something.</p>
      <p>“I got into the drama school at 18 and I turned up in what was left of my grey flannel school uniform and all the other students were in their Afghan coats. I felt like a prat.”</p>

      <p>Next up, he is co-narrating the Grinch musical in Edinburgh from November 26 to December 1.</p>
      <p>He said: “My children reminded me we used to watch the Jim Carrey film when they were wee. According to my daughter Cissie, who is a film agent, there’s another movie of it with Benedict Cumberbatch. She told me I had to do it.</p>
      <p>“It was tempting and I thought it would be fun because it won’t take me weeks and I’ll get back to France for Christmas and it will all be lovely so that’s what I’m doing.</p>
      <p>“There’s no smutty jokes and it is full-on high octane night for the family in the theatre, just out of Hollywood.</p>
      <p>“You’ll be floating when you see it and think, wow.”</p>
