      <p>India's supreme court has ruled that a Hindu temple can be built on the country's most hotly contested religious site, ending a legal dispute that has run for decades between Hindus and Muslims.</p>
      <p>The restoration of the Ram temple in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ayodhya">Ayodhya</a> was  a key pledge of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/narendra-modi">Narendra Modi</a> and his Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) government. The ruling, which came just six months after his landslide election win, is another huge victory for India’s prime minister</p>
