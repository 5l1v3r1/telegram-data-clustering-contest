      <p>Leicester - <b>Leicester</b> opened up a nine-point lead over <b>Arsenal </b>in the battle for Champions League qualification and moved second in the Premier League with a 2-0 win over the Gunners on Saturday.</p>
      <p><b>Jamie Vardy</b> and <b>James Maddison</b> were the architects of another fine victory for the Foxes as the English duo struck in the space of seven second-half minutes.</p>
      <p>Arsenal are now eight points adrift of the top four and will fall even further behind should Manchester City avoid defeat away to league leaders Liverpool on Sunday.</p>
      <p>In the face of mounting speculation over his future, Emery surprisingly maintained Mesut Ozil alongside the front two of new captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette.</p>
      <p>That bold strategy nearly paid off when Lacazette fired the first big chance of the match inches wide after Aubameyang had burrowed his way into the area.</p>
      <p>Thereafter, it was Leicester who had all the better chances to break the deadlock.</p>
      <p>Vardy failed to connect with Ayoze Perez's dangerous cross before Maddison curled a free-kick inches wide.</p>
      <p>Wilfred Ndidi was next to miss a glorious chance when he smashed off the crossbar with the goal gaping from Ricardo Pereira's cutback four minutes into the second half.</p>
      <p>Arsenal were the first to put the ball in the net when Aubameyang supplied a characteristically clinical finish but was rightly flagged offside.</p>
      <p>Vardy has an excellent record against Arsenal and when his chance came, the Premier League's top scorer was ruthless with a low finish past Bernd Leno from Youri Tielemans's pass.</p>
      <p>The former England striker then turned provider as he laid the ball back into the path of Maddison to drill a low shot in from outside the box.</p>
      <p>Arsenal offered precious little after going behind and have now won just two of their last 10 league games.</p>
