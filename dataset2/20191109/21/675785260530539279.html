      <h1>Bayern Munich chiefs confirms imminent Arsene Wenger talks over managerial vacancy</h1>
      <h2>Former Arsenal boss Wenger, 70, had been open to moving to the Allianz Arena - thanks in part to his close friendship with chief Rummenigge</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T21:14:30+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 21:14</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Bayern Munich chief Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has revealed that Hans-Dieter Flick will remain in charge "until further notice" - and he will hold talks with Arsene Wenger to explain the situation.</p>
      <p>Flick took over from Niko Kovac, who was sacked following the 5-1 thrashing by Eintracht Frankfurt last weekend, and has guided Bayern to impressive wins over Olympiacos and Borussia Dortmund.</p>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> gaffer Wenger, 70, had been open to moving to the Allianz Arena - thanks in part to his close friendship with chief Rummenigge.</p>
      <p>The Frenchman, however, seemingly pulled out of the race to become the next Bayern boss over the weekend.</p>
      <p>And now Rummenigge has appeared to suggest that Flick will be given an opportunity to stake a claim for the permanent job.</p>

      <p>He told Sport1: “We will work with Hansi Flick until further notice. I have respect for Arsene. We will call him and clear things up. I don't want to stress him."</p>
      <p>This revelation comes after Wenger insisted that his interest in the job has ended.</p>
      <p>The Frenchman hasn't had a job in football management since he departed the Gunners in 2018 after 22 years at the helm in north London - where he won three Premier League titles and seven FA Cups.</p>
      <p>"I wish good luck to Bayern, and for me the situation is settled," beIN Sports report him saying.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, two goals from the seemingly unstoppable Robert Lewandowski helped Bayern Munich banish the nightmare of last week's thrashing by Frankfurt that led to the sacking of Kovac.</p>
      <p>Six days after Bayern's heaviest Bundesliga defeat for over 10 years in losing 5-1 to Eintracht, Bayern hammered old rivals Borussia Dortmund 4-0 at the Allianz Arena to move up to third and a point behind leaders Borussia Moenchengladbach.</p>
      <p>Poland striker Lewandowski scored the first and third goals in the 17th and 76th minutes to take his tally to a remarkable 26 in 22 games for club and country this season.</p>
      <p>Serge Gnabry added a VAR-confirmed second just after the break, with a Mats Hummels own goal 10 minutes from time compounding Dortmund's misery.</p>
