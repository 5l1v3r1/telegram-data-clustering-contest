      <p>The UFC Moscow card is almost over and the co-main event just witnessed the promotion’s #7 ranked heavyweight, Alexander Volkov, outclass former NFL star, Greg Hardy across three rounds. Hardy didn’t have much for the severely more polished Volkov. The Russian set back and picked his shots and took home the decision.</p>
      <p>Danny Roberts pulled off a spectacular knockout on Zelim Imadaev at the end of the second round. He blasted his foe with a bodacious left hand that instantly slumped Imadaev. The ref was right on top of the action and no followup was necessary. With this highlight finish, Roberts breaks up a two-fight losing skid.</p>
      <p>Khadis Ibragimov and Ed Herman left it all in the Octagon tonight. Ibragimov started hot but Herman was ready. It was the knees of Herman that did the bulk of the damage that aided him in taking the unanimous decision. The longtime UFC veteran in Herman has now won two in a row.</p>
      <p>Anthony Rocco Martin and Ramazan Emeev went the distance in their welterweight tilt. Emeev was snapping with his jab but Martin doing serious damage with his calf kicks. Martin took home the unanimous decision to get himself back in the win column. Opening up the main card, Shamil Gamzatov and Klidson Abreu put on a sticky standup battle for the bulk of three rounds. There weren’t many ‘wow’ moments, but it was a hard-fought bout nonetheless. When the smoke cleared, it was Gamzatov who walked away with the split decision to remain undefeated — and move to 14-0 in his UFC debut.</p>

      </p>
      <h4>Alexander Volkov def. Greg Hardy by unanimous decision (30-27 x3): Heavyweight</h4>
      <p>Volkov came out hitting inside leg kicks. Hardy tried to blast a takedown but Volkov wasn’t having it. Hardy was rather reserved, allowing Volkov to lead the dance. He got in a couple of punches here and there, but the volume was on the side of the Russian. The broadcast announced that Hardy injured his right hand. In the second round, Hardy threw much more lefts than anything else. Volkov was content to pick apart Hardy from the outside, really cracking with his body kicks. Hardy showed up in the third round with urgency. Despite the aggression, he just didn’t have the technical experience to catch the much more experienced Volkov. The Russian kept picking apart his opponent at a controlled rate.</p>
      <h4>Danny Roberts def. Zelim Imadaev by KO at 4:54 of round 2 :Welterweight</h4>
      <p>Roberts came out looking for the takedown, but Imadaev fought it off to remain on his feet. Several strong knees got through for Roberts on the inside. Roberts ended up getting a takedown, but Imadaev was quick to spring right back up. Several un addressed inside leg kicks connected for Roberts.</p>
      <p>Roberts went back to the takedown to open the second act, but ended up on the bottom because of it. Back on the feet, Imadaev was throwing his punches in bunches, prompting Roberts to shoot in again. In the clinch, Roberts landed some more knees to the body. Then, it was Imadaev who got the takedown, albeit short lived. Just as the ten-second sticks clacked, Roberts uncorked a sinister left hook that completely shutoff Imadaev. Wow!</p>

      <h4>Ed Herman def. Khadis Ibragimov by unanimous decision (30-27 x2, 29-28): Light Heavyweight</h4>
      <p>Ibragimov came out with a flurry before shoving Herman up against the fence. Herman was landed solid knees and elbows with his back to the cage. Ibragimov tried to muscle the takedowns, but just taxed his gas tank as a result. Ibragimov went hard with his strikes to open the second round, but Herman was able to weather the storm. Herman then closed the distance and went back to his clinch work. Several hard knees were landed to the skull of Ibragimov. Back in open space, Ibragimov looked visibly fatigued.</p>
      <p>The fighters stood and traded to open the final round, before the pace slowed down a bit. The match went back to the fence after Ibragimov shot for a single leg. On the inside, Herman kept launching knees to the face. Ibragimov secured a takedown, but Herman was the more active fighter on the ground. Herman threatened wit sub attempts and landed some elbows before scrambling back to his feet.</p>

      <h4>Anthony Rocco Martin def. Ramazan Emeev by unanimous decision (30-27, 29-28 x2): Welterweight</h4>
      <p>Emeev met the aggression of Martin with slick punches. He then closed the distance but Martin locked up a Kimura. Emeev fought his way out and landed a few knees from the clinch. One of the knees hit the cup, and a time out was called. The fight resumed and Martin looked to kick the calf as Emeev worked his jab.</p>
      <p>Martin went back to the calf kick in the second round, causing noticeable welts. Emeev shot in and had to fight off a brief guillotine attempt. Back on the feet, Emeev complained that Martin was too slippery, or something, but the ref ignored it. Martin went back to attacking the calf.</p>
      <p>Emeev started the final round with a major hematoma on his left calf. Emeev continued to work his quick jab, but those calf kicks of Martin kept coming. Emeev was also unable to get the fight down to the ground with Martin sprawling perfectly. Emeev tried to pick up the pace in the closing moments, but Martin stood his ground.</p>
      <h4>Shamil Gamzatov def. Klidson Abreu by split decision (29-28 x2, 28-29): Middleweight</h4>
      <p>Abreu looked to pressure early on, but it wasn’t long before Gamzatov started to push back. Both men were throwing hard, but a lot of strikes were getting blocked. The whole first round was spent on the feet, with neither man really landing a substantial blow. The middleweights stood right in front of each other again in the second round. The defense of both fighters was there. There were a lot of glancing blows and few of them with full on impacts. Abreu scored a brief takedown towards the end of the round, possibly securing the frame. The stickiness continued in the final round. Gamzatov started to land more as Abreu’s output began to dwindle. Abreu closed the distance and clinched up with Gamzatov against the fence. Nothing major happened there before time ran out.</p>
