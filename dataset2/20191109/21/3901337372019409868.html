      <p>Karim Benzema continued his impressive start to the season after netting a brace as Real Madrid thumped Eibar 4-0 in LaLiga on Saturday evening.</p>
      <p>Los Blancos got the ball rolling on 17 minutes when as Federico Valverde did well to tee up Karim Benzema, who made no mistake from close range for his eighth league of the season.</p>
      <p>Three minutes later, the visitors were awarded a penalty after Eden Hazard was brought down in the box. Sergio Ramos stepped up, just as he did earlier this, and converted from 12-yards out to double the lead.</p>
      <p>Los Blancos were awarded a second penalty in the 29th minute as Cote was judged to have brought down Lucas Vazquez. However, Benzema took responsibility this time and calmly slotted home for his second and Real's third.</p>

      <p>At the other end, Real shot-stopper Thibaut Courtois enjoyed a quiet opening 45 minutes between the sticks, despite Eibar's late forays in the latter stages of the half.</p>
      <p>Zinedine Zidane's troops picked up from where they left off in the first after bagging a fourth goal on the hour mark as a superb pass from Luka Modric found Valverde, who slotted into the bottom corner.</p>
      <p>With the visitors' comfortably leading, Zidane opted to withdraw Hazard and Valverde for the final 20 minutes as Vinicius Junior and Isco made their way onto the pitch.</p>
      <p>Eibar were unable to trouble the Los Blancos goal in the latter stages of the half as Zidane's changes ran out comfortable winners on the night.</p>
