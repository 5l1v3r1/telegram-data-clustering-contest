      <p>London - <b>Leicester</b> moved up to second in the Premier League as a 2-0 victory over <b>Arsenal</b> on Saturday further dented the Gunners' hopes of a top-four finish.</p>
      <p><b>Chelsea</b> were also 2-0 victors against <b>Crystal Palace </b>as they too jumped above Manchester City into third.</p>
      <p>But it was another woeful afternoon for north London's big two as Tottenham were held 1-1 at home by Sheffield United to slip to 12th.</p>
      <p>League leaders Liverpool host City in a highly-anticipated clash between the champions of Europe and champions of England at Anfield on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Leicester and Chelsea took advantage of kicking off a day earlier to move a point ahead of City and close to within five of Liverpool.</p>
      <p>The Foxes' superior goal difference takes them into second as second-half strikes from Jamie Vardy and James Maddison piled more pressure on beleaguered Arsenal boss Unai Emery.</p>
      <p>Arsenal are now eight points adrift of the top four and will fall even further behind should City avoid defeat at Anfield.</p>
      <p>Chelsea were equally as impressive with a patient performance to break down a defensively dogged Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge.</p>
      <p>Tammy Abraham opened the scoring as the England striker pounced on a deft flick through by Willian seven minutes into the second half.</p>
      <p>Christian Pulisic then secured all three points when the American headed home his fifth goal in his last three Premier League games.</p>
      <p>"We won the game relatively comfortably," said Chelsea boss Frank Lampard. "A nice, solid win with a clean sheet."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Tottenham, West Ham woes</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Tottenham Hotspur</b> were lucky to even escape with a point as <b>Sheffield United</b> impressed once more to move up to fifth.</p>
      <p>"The reality is that for different reasons we are not showing the performances that we expect," said Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino.</p>
      <p>"We are not in a good position in the table."</p>
      <p>A rare defensive error from the Blades set up Son Heung-min to open the scoring with his eighth goal of the season just before the hour mark.</p>
      <p>David McGoldrick thought he had levelled almost immediately, but after a three-minute delay the goal was ruled out for John Lundstram being millimetres offside in the build-up.</p>
      <p>To their credit, Chris Wilder's men were not downhearted and survived another VAR review when George Baldock's cross from the right evaded everyone and found the bottom corner.</p>
      <p>"I'm more interested in the recovery of my players, how they went for the jugular to try and get back in the game," said Wilder on the VAR controversy.</p>
      <p><b>West Ham's</b> woes continued as Manuel Pellegrini's men were beaten 3-0 at <b>Burnley</b> to stretch their winless streak to seven games.</p>
      <p>Ashley Barnes opened the scoring after 11 minutes as Burnley never looked back.</p>
      <p>Chris Wood doubled the hosts' advantage after earlier having a goal ruled out by VAR for offside and a miserable day for the visitors at Turf Moor was summed up when goalkeeper Roberto punched a corner into his own net.</p>
      <p>"When you concede so many easy goals it does not help," said Pellegrini.</p>
      <p><b>Everton</b> moved six points clear of the relegation zone thanks to a 2-1 win at <b>Southampton</b> to ease the pressure on Marco Silva.</p>
      <p>Tom Davies gave the Toffees the perfect start at St Mary's before Danny Ings equalised early in the second half.</p>
      <p>But Richarlison struck the winner 15 minutes from time to secure Everton's first away league win since March.</p>
      <p><b>Newcastle</b> are now seven points clear of the drop zone as they came from behind to beat <b>Bournemouth</b> 2-1 at St James' Park thanks to goals from DeAndre Yedlin and Ciaran Clark.</p>
