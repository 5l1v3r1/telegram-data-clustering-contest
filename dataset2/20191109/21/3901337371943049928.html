      </p>
      <p>Cardoso struck the winner from the penalty spot as the AmaKhosi defeated Orlando Pirates 3-2 to move 10 points at the top of the Absa Premiership on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The defender feels there is a lot more fight in the current Chiefs side compared to seasons gone by.</p>
      <p>"You can see we're actually fighting as a team, I mean look at the past few games, we've been fighting with all our heart and might and I think that's the difference from the past few seasons, you know, we're sticking together and it all starts at training," Cardoso told SuperSport after the game.</p>
      <p>Chiefs allowed Pirates to get back in the game after taking a two-goal lead and Cardoso says they are making a habit of getting relaxed with a comfortable lead.</p>
      <p>"First of all thanks to God for giving us this great game we produced today, from both sides, very entertaining game so credit to the fans, what a great spectacle today, five goal thriller, when last... they [fans] paid for this and we delivered today.</p>
      <p>"Thanks also to Chiefs supporters, if you look at the stadium, it's unbelievable, all black and yellow and it's helping us in the field of play," he went on.</p>
      <p>"We started very well today, when we were 2-0 up, I think we got a bit relaxed, it seems like it's becoming a habit, when we got two, three goals up we start to relax a bit and that shouldn't be the way to take the game, because if you become too relaxed, we gonna start conceding silly goals like we did earlier.</p>
      <p>"It was a very good free-kick from [Vincent] Pule, from a tight angle, I've got to give him the heads up for that and also the second goal was also a great goal from [Gabadinho] Mhango but we needed to deal with it better you know. Going 2-0 up in the first half we needed a better control of the game."</p>
