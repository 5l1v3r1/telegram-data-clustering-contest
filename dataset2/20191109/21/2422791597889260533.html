      <p>DESIO, Italy -- Players in a youth team match in Italy had black stripes painted on their faces in support of a young player who was racially abused last weekend.</p>
      <p>The initiative in the Under-17 league match between Aurora Desio and Sovicese was in response to a 10-year-old Desio player allegedly being racially abused by the mother of an opponent in a junior match between the two teams.</p>
      <p>The players also had the message "the only race I know is the human one" on their shirts during Saturday's match, while there were special armbands for the captains and the slogan "VAR -- Vietato ai Razzisti" (forbidden to racists).</p>
      <p>The match was played in Desio, about 15 kilometres (nine miles) north of Milan.</p>
      <p>The black youngster continued playing after hearing the alleged slur last Saturday but reported the incident to his coach and parents after the match.</p>
