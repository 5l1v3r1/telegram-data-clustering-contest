      <h1>Derek McInnes slams Aberdeen penalty decision but praises stars for Ross County comeback</h1>
      <h2>The Dons boss doesn't believe the penalty given to County should have been but admits his players showed great character to fight back.</h2>

      <p>Aberdeen manager <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/derek-mcinnes">Derek McInnes</a> was far from convinced that referee Alan Newlands got it right when he awarded Ross County a penalty in his side's 3-1 victory.</p>
      <p>Newlands gave County a fifth-minute spot-kick for handball against Lewis Ferguson, which Josh Mullin converted, but the Dons stormed back.</p>
      <p>He said: "I felt a bit bewildered at the start as there was no real claim from Ross County for a penalty.</p>
      <p>"Lewis Ferguson has turned his back to protect his face and the ball hasn't travelled any distance to make it a deliberate handball plus I'm not sure it was in the box either.</p>
      <p>"But if you are going to fall behind the best time do it is in the first five minutes."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aberdeen-fc">Aberdeen</a> hit back as <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/niall-mcginn">Niall McGinn</a> levelled five minutes later before Ryan Hedges and Andrew Considine struck in the second half.</p>
      <p>"We had enough good play in the first half and it was a great free-kick from Niall McGinn," McInnes said.</p>

      <p>"We were the team asking more of the questions up to half-time but the introduction of Curtis Main at the start of the second half helped us.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ross-county-fc">"Ross County</a> went 4-4-2 and I thought matching up and making sure our front two caused their centre-backs more problems was the way to go and we did that.</p>
      <p>"Andy Considine's goal was a fairer reflection on the game as I thought we were guilty of missing more opportunities.</p>
      <p>"But I would have taken any win coming up here as we've had to bounce back from a few blows and we've done that by winning three games.</p>
      <p>"We've done our bit after the defeat to Celtic and it's pleasing to get nine points. The only negative was not getting a third clean sheet in a row."</p>
      <p>County have now not won in seven matches, leaving them sixth in the Ladbrokes Premiership.</p>
      <p>Boss Steven Ferguson said: "It sounds silly when you lose a game 3-1 at home, but we felt we had a decent game-plan.</p>

      <p>"We tried to go with two wide players and two strikers and be compact and tight when out of possession and we always felt with those players we could pose a threat.</p>
      <p>"But we feel we're contributing to the goals we're losing - and that's the frustrating thing. But Aberdeen know how to win games and put you under pressure.</p>
      <p>"That said, we didn't feel we were going to lose goals in open play. We felt we were frustrating Aberdeen and offering something in attack.</p>
      <p>"But the two free-kicks, we felt we played a part in the goals and also the third goal we were kicking ourselves.</p>
      <p>"They were looking for a penalty, but we just need to clear our box and we had two opportunities to do that.</p>
      <p>"So we need to eradicate that because you're not going to get away with that in the Premiership."*</p>
