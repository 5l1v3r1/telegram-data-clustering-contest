      <h1>Nawaz still on ECL as NAB shifts onus on govt</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T21:33:11+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 21:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/8905/rameez-khan-and-tufail-ahmed/" target="_blank">Rameez Khan And Tufail Ahmed</a></address>
      <p><b>LAHORE/KARACHI: </b>Ailing former prime minister Nawaz Sharif may not leave for London on Sunday as authorities have not yet removed his name from the no-fly list – the Exit Control List (ECL) – with the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) having sought Nawaz’s medical reports.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, three return tickets have been booked – for Nawaz, his brother Shehbaz Sharif and family physician Dr Adnan Khan – at Qatar Airways for a flight that will leave for London at 9:05am on Monday (tomorrow). The date of the return flight is November 27.</p>
      <p>Earlier, on Friday, Nawaz was expected to leave for London by Sunday morning to receive medical treatment at the Harley Street Clinic after it was expected that his name would be removed from the ECL by the government.</p>

        <b>No politics on Nawaz health: PM Imran</b>
      </p>
      <p>Statements by government representatives gave credence to these plans as they gave an impression that the government might remove Nawaz’s name on its own even if the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) – which is prosecution in the case in which Nawaz was convicted was – delays permission.</p>
      <p>However, later in the same day Prime Minister Imran Khan made it clear that Nawaz Sharif’s name would only be removed on recommendation of NAB as it was put on the ECL on its recommendation.</p>
      <p>Sources in NAB claimed that since it had received application by the Interior Ministry after office hours on Friday, so it could not process it, refuting claims that a board of directors meeting had taken place on Friday to reconsider the said application amongst other things.</p>
      <p>An official, while requesting anonymity, claimed that on Saturday immediately after reviewing the letter of the Interior Ministry, it was responded with a request by NAB to provide medical reports of the former prime minister.</p>
      <p>He said when the Interior Ministry had removed names of accused of similar nature from the ECL on its own then why it was finding now seeking permission of NAB.</p>

      <p>He said according his information NAB will not gave any straight forward recommendation to the Interior Ministry, as it feels that Nawaz Sharif was needed for the legal proceedings of his cases.</p>
      <p>“In case, we find medical reports give a very gloomy picture of his health, we will recommend the matter to be settled in a court where they can submit a surety bond thus vindicating NAB of any responsibility.</p>
      <p>“NAB not contesting Nawaz’s bail applications in courts on humanitarian grounds, did not mean that it would allow Nawaz Sharif to travel aboard just like that,” he added.</p>
      <p>The PML-N leaders said multiple travel options were under consideration so that the moment Nawaz Sharif’s name was removed from the ECL, they could send him to London for treatment.</p>

        <b>Nawaz’s platelet count improves</b>
      </p>
      <p>There has been much improvement in the platelet count of former prime minister, ahead of his expected departure for treatment abroad and the medical board examining his health condition is satisfied with it, it is learnt.</p>
      <p>It is also learnt that the medical board had contacted Dr Tahir Shamsi, a specialist from Karachi, for the medical check-up of Nawaz. Dr Shamsi conducted a detailed medical check-up of the former prime minister at his residence in Lahore.</p>
      <p>The Punjab government held a meeting of the government’s medical board at the Services Hospital, where the latest medical reports of Nawaz were reviewed and the suggestion of the medical board to send him abroad was affirmed.</p>
      <p>For the treatment, according to the sources, London’s Harley Street Clinic had been contacted. It is also learnt that Nawaz’s personal physician and Chief Executive of the Sharif Medical City, Dr Adnan Khan, will accompany him.</p>
      <p>Nawaz’s medical reports had also been sent to the Princess Grace Hospital, where a medical board had been set up. Late wife of Nawaz, Begum Kulsoom Nawaz, had been under treatment at the same hospital.</p>
      <p>The sources indicated the use of private air ambulance for the departure of Nawaz to London. Efforts were made to contact Dr Adnan Khan and Dr Tahir Shamsi for an update on Nawaz’s health, but did not bear fruit.</p>
