      <p>This year's event marks 75 years since notable battles of 1944, including Monte Cassino, Kohima and Imphal, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/d-day-landings-aircraft-make-16193199">D-Day</a> and the collaboration of Commonwealth and Allied forces.</p>
      <p>It also celebrates the 100th anniversary of the Government Communications Headquarters, and pays tribute to RFA Mounts Bay which this year delivered supplies and aid to the Bahamas after Hurricane Dorian.</p>
      <p>The ceremony is hosted by the Royal British Legion and commemorates all those who have lost their lives in conflicts.</p>
