      <p>“Trump sat in a box owned by Jim Wilson, a real estate businessman from Alabama. The president was joined by Louisiana Republican Reps. Clay Higgins, Mike Johnson, Ralph Abraham and Garret Graves; Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., and Alabama Republican Reps. Robert Aderholt, Bradley Byrne and Gary Palmer,” ESPN <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/28042819/president-trump-soaks-deep-south-cheers-lsu-alabama-game">reports</a>.<br/>The visit marks President Trump’s third different sporting event attended in just the last few weeks. The president attended Game 5 of the World Series between the Nationals and the Astros and he became the first sitting president in U.S. history to attend a UFC fight last weekend. In addition, the president also hosted the Nationals at the White House after their World Series victory.</p>
      <p>This, however, is not Trump’s first time attending a big time SEC matchup. The president was also in attendance when Alabama took on Georgia for the national championship at the end of the 2017 season.</p>
