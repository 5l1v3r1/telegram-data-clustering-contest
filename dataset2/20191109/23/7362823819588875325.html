      <h1>LSU holds off Alabama in much-anticipated shootout</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T23:57:25+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 23:57</time> by <a rel="author">Samuel Chamberlain</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/lsu-tigers">LSU</a> staked their claim to being the No.1 team in the nation on Saturday, while Joe Burrow staked his claim to the Heisman Trophy.</p>
      <p>Before a crowd of more than 100,000 people at Bryant-Denny Stadium -- including the president and first lady -- Burrow completed 31 of 39 passes for 393 yards and three touchdowns as LSU knocked off <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/alabama-crimson-tide">Alabama</a> 46-41 in the first regular-season matchup between the top two teams in the Associated Press poll since the Tigers and the Tide squared off in 2011.</p>
      <p>The Tigers, ranked second in the College Football Playoff rankings, appeared to take control of the game with a 23-point second quarter in which Burrow threw for two touchdowns and Clyde Edwards-Helaire (180 all-purpose yards) ran for a score and caught one of Burrow's touchdown passes. The duo's 13-yard hookup gave LSU a 33-13 lead at halftime, the largest deficit a Nick Saban-coached Crimson Tide team had faced after 30 minutes.</p>

      <p>But Alabama, specifically Najee Harris, responded like champions. First, Harris caught a 15-yard third-quarter touchdown pass from Tua Tagovailoa, who was carrying a right ankle injury and looked well shy of 100 percent. Then, Harris powered over from one yard out early in the fourth quarter to bring the Tide (ranked No. 3 by the playoff committee) within 33-27.</p>
      <p>But then it was Burrow's turn. The Ohio State transfer guided the Tigers 75 yards in 12 plays, scrambling for 15 yards on a crucial third-and-five before Edwards-Helaire turned the corner to score from five yards out.</p>

      <p>Tagovailoa hit Jerry Jeudy for a five-yard touchdown on fourth-and-two to bring Alabama to within 39-34, but the Tide's defense could not stop Burrow and Edwards-Helaire. The two led LSU on another 75-yard march that was capped by a seven-yard touchdown run for Edwards-Helaire. On the preceding play, Burrow ran around Alabama's right end to pick up 18 yards on a third-and-two.</p>
      <p>With the score 46-34 with 90 seconds to play, Tagovailoa (who finished 21-for-40 for 418 yards, four touchdowns and an interception) hit DeVonta Smith for an 85-yard touchdown pass that provided the final margin. Jordan Jefferson recovered the ensuing onside kick and LSU could start a celebration eight years in the making.</p>
