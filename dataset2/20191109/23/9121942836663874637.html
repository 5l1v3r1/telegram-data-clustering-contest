      <p>HONOLULU (AP) — Chevan Cordeiro accounted for five touchdowns, including two in the fourth quarter, and Hawaii held on for a 42-40 win over San Jose State on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>Cordeiro was 23-of-31 passing for 309 yards and three touchdowns with no interceptions and added 11 carries for 55 yards and two scores. Miles Reed had 124 yards rushing and a TD on 17 carries and JoJo Ward finished with seven receptions for 170 yards and two touchdowns for Hawaii (6-4, 3-3 Mountain West).</p>
      <p>San Jose State’s 16-play, 67-yard drive stalled and the Spartans (4-6, 1-5) settled for a 28-yard field goal by Matt Mercurio that trimmed their deficit to 28-26 going into the fourth quarter. Cordeiro hit Jared Smart for a 5-yard touchdown to give Hawaii a nine-point lead with 12 minutes to go and, after Josh Love connected with Bailey Gaither for a 40-yard TD about 2 ½ minutes later, Cordeiro’s 2-yard scoring run capped a 12-play, 85-yard drive to make it 42-33 with 4:23 remaining.</p>
      <p>Love hit Isaiah Ward for a 19-yard touchdown to bring San Jose State within two with 1:51 to go but Cordeiro’s 4-yard run on third-and-2 allowed the Rainbow Warriors to bleed the clock.</p>
      <p>Love passed for 375 yards and two TDs, DeJon Packer had 20 carries for 112 yards and two scores and Tre Walker had 10 receptions for 138 yards for San Jose State.</p>
