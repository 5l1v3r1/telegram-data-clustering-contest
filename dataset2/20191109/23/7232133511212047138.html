      <p>As you are likely aware, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/category/crypto/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> (BTC) hasn’t done too well over the past two-odd days. Since Friday, the cryptocurrency has shed 6% of its value, tanking from $9,250 to $8,700 in a strong move lower that came after nearly two weeks of bullish consolidation above $9,000.</p>
      <p>Despite this relatively mild price action, which wasn’t exactly a move that slaughtered bulls per se, a number of traders have flipped bearish. Bloomberg, for instance, wrote that there is a likelihood that if the bearish pressure persists for a little more, Bitcoin <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/09/key-technical-indicator-signals-bitcoin-may-soon-revisit-7300/">will trend all the way back to $7,300</a> — back where it was prior to the most recent swing upwards.</p>
      <p>This sentiment, according to a number of analysts, is irrational.</p>

      <h3>Bears Are Irrational? </h3>
      <p>Popular crypto trader Mayne <a href="https://twitter.com/Tradermayne/status/1192888783894544384">recently noted</a> that the “people waiting for $6,000” are irrational. He quipped that Bitcoin retracing and consolidating after its fourth-biggest bull move in history ($7,300 to $10,500, a 42% gain) is perfectly par for the course, but noted that it’s totally possible we can go lower from $8,800.</p>

      <p>Crypto Michael echoed this line. The Amsterdam Stock Exchange trader poked fun at the euphoria that bears have had over the past days, accentuating the irrationality of the claims that a retest of the lows is on its way, especially in the context of the recent 42% gain:</p>
      <blockquote>I do remember bears being euphoric with a $1000 dropdown on a daily candle, now they are euphoric with a $300 retrace after one of the most bullish candles in the history of bBTC.</blockquote>

      <p>Delphi Digital has corroborated this sentiment with data. Per <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/03/research-firm-bitcoin-price-bottomed-7300-recovery-possible/">previous reports from NewsBTC</a>, the prominent cryptocurrency markets research firm found that there is a confluence of evidence suggesting that Bitcoin found a trend bottom at $7,300 two weeks ago.</p>
      <p>One of their tidbits of evidence is that Bitcoin’s volume profile, the amount of cryptocurrency that was traded, has printed clear signs that a bottom is in. More specifically, the market printed signs of weak volume (capitulation), a short accumulation at the bottoming range, then a surge out of accumulation into a potentially new bull phase.</p>
      <p>They added that they currently see the cryptocurrency market very tied to<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/08/gold-plummets-u-s-stock-market-sees-record-high-will-bitcoin-follow/"> risk assets, like the S&amp;P 500.</a> With risk assets setting new all-time highs on Friday after a strong jobs report and a potential trade deal, it could be said that BTC will surge higher with the risk assets.</p>

      <h3>Bitcoin’s Long-Term Bull Case Remains</h3>
      <p>Indeed, the cryptocurrency long-term charts and signals still seem to be implying that medium to long-term upside is highly likely.</p>
      <p>As <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/01/analyst-bitcoin-more-likely-to-surge-50-to-14000-than-fall/">reported by NewsBTC previously</a>, Trader <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoHornHairs">HornHairs</a> has noted that he “likes the chance we hit $14,000 before $7,000.” He remarked in a recent tweet that with Bitcoin bouncing strong and holding above the one-month bullish breaker, the 0.618 Fibonacci Retracement of the entire cycle, the Point of Control as defined by the volume profile, and the yearly pivot, BTC is leaning rather bullish.</p>

      <p>Also, trader and CoinTelegraph contributor FilbFilb found that by the end of November or start of December, the 50-week and 100-week moving averages <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/10/31/bitcoin-see-collosal-golden-cross-2019-precede-price-boom/">will see a “golden cross,”</a> which he claims is far more significant” for the Bitcoin market that other technical crosses.</p>
