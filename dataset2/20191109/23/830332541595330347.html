      <p>COLORADO SPRINGS, Colorado - The rancher and philanthropist best known for playing the original "Marlboro Man" has died after a life spent not smoking.</p>
      <p>Robert 'Bob' Norris died in the care of Pikes Peak Hospice in Colorado Springs, Colorado, on Nov. 3, according to a <a href="https://www.teecrossranches.com/blog/Robert-Norris">statement released</a> by Tee Cross Ranches, which he founded. Norris was 90.</p>
      <p>"If any man could be described in three words, for Bob they would be 'the real deal.' His solid authenticity, whether astride a horse, sitting in a board room, mentoring a child or sharing a moment with a friend, was his personal and professional brand. No doubt it was these qualities -- along with his tall, ruggedly handsome, lanky good looks -- that landed him the unexpected role of the first 'Marlboro Man' on television," the statement on the ranch's website <a href="https://www.teecrossranches.com/blog/Robert-Norris">said</a>.</p>
      <p>Norris, who was "never a smoker," was featured in the commercials for 14 years, according to the statement. He abandoned the advertising campaign when Norris "felt he was setting a poor example for his children," the statement added.</p>
      <p>Norris was a member of the board of trustees for the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum, also known as the Cowboy Hall of Fame, the ranch's website said.</p>
