      <p><b>STOCKHOLMÂ (AP)</b> - Pat Maroon and the Tampa Bay Lightning made the most of their long trip to Sweden.</p>
      <p>Maroon scored twice, and the Lighting beat the Buffalo Sabres 5-3 on Saturday for a sweep of their two regular-season games in Stockholm.</p>
      <p>Victor Hedman also scored for the Lightning, delighting the home crowd, and Curtis McElhinney made 40 saves. Tampa Bay also beat Buffalo 3-2 on Friday.</p>
      <p>Hedman, who is from Ornskoldsvik, Sweden, converted a power-play slap shot 1:58 into the second period, lifting the Lightning to a 2-1 lead.</p>
      <p>"This has been an unbelievable experience for me and my teammates," Hedman said. "For me, coming home and finish it off with two wins was a tremendous experience."</p>
      <p>Marcus Johansson, another Swede, was in the penalty box when Hedman scored his third goal of the season. Johansson was whistled for interference against Mathieu Joseph.</p>
      <p>"It was again a moment that shifted the game away from us," Buffalo coach Ralph Krueger said. "It's questionable and I probably shouldn't say more than that other than there was a collision of two players moving through the same space and Marcus Johansson was the bigger and stronger of the two and was punished for that."</p>
      <p>Jack Eichel and Sam Reinhart each had a goal and an assist for Buffalo, which has dropped five in a row. Victor Olofsson also scored in his native country, and Carter Hutton made 35 saves.</p>
      <p>The two sold-out games in Stockholm's Ericsson Globe were part of the 2019 NHL Global Series.</p>
      <p>Tampa Bay won for the third time in four games overall. Last season's Presidents' Trophy winners appear to be rounding into form after a slow start to the season.</p>
      <p>"In a funny way, I think this is what our team needed," captain Steven Stamkos said. "We became tighter as a group on this trip and you saw it on the ice."</p>
      <p>Yanni Gourde had a goal and an assist for the Lightning, and Joseph also scored.</p>
      <p>The Sabres jumped in front when Reinhart's wrist shot from the right circle hit the post and bounced off McElhinney's back for a 1-0 lead 9:30 into the first. Reinhart also scored twice in Friday's loss.</p>
      <p>But the Lightning responded with three straight goals, with the fourth line of Maroon, Gourde and Cedric Paquette playing a key role.</p>
      <p>"I'd rather call it Paquette's line," Tampa Bay coach Jon Cooper said. "They may have been the difference in both games for us. They were a hard line for (Buffalo's) D core to handle. ... All three of them were fantastic."</p>
      <p>Maroon tied it at 1 with a power-play deflection late in the first. After Hedman put Tampa Bay ahead to stay, Maroon scored his third of the season when he jammed home a rebound for a 3-1 lead in the final seconds of the second.</p>
      <p>"We all kind of play the same way," Maroon said. "We find ways to get pucks. We know how to attack the net. We all love crashing the net."</p>
      <p>Gourde and Joseph helped put it away when they scored 67 seconds apart midway through the third, giving the Lightning a 5-2 lead. Gourde was successful on a wrist shot, and Joseph knocked in a rebound.</p>
      <p>It's the third straight year - and eighth overall - the NHL has played in Europe to try to increase its local following in hockey-mad countries including Sweden, Finland and the Czech Republic.</p>
      <p>The NHL is set to return to Europe also next year.</p>
      <p>NOTES: Tampa Bay matched the NHL record for most goals in a regular-season game contested outside North America. The Lightning and Sabres also equaled the record for combined goals in such games. ... It was the 28th NHL regular-season game in Europe. ... Buffalo F Vladimir Sobotka was sidelined after he was hit by Nikita Kucherov in the first period of Friday's game. Krueger said Sobotka will be evaluated on Monday. ... Buffalo F Casey Mittelstadt played in his 100th NHL game. ... Tampa Bay beat Buffalo for the fifth time in a row.</p>
