      <blockquote>According to what is described as the most profitable company in the world, the Saudi Aramco <a href="https://www.saudiaramco.com/-/media/images/investors/saudi-aramco-prospectus-en.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=8DE2DCD689D6E383BB8F4C393033D8964C9F5585">prospectus confirms</a> an offer of up to 0.5 percent of its shares to individual investors, adding that selling shareholders will receive all of the proceeds of the offering and will reimburse Saudi Aramco for all fees, costs and expenses.</blockquote>
      <p>The document also stresses that the company will be prohibited from listing additional shares for a period of six months after the commencement of trading on the exchange.</p>
      <p>According to the company's prospectus, institutional investors can apply for Saudi Aramco's IPO between 17 November and 4 December. Individual investors can apply between 17 and 28 November.</p>
      <p>Prospectus also reveals Saudi Aramco's IPO underwriter investment banks.</p>
      <p>Major US investment banks include Citigroup Saudi Arabia, Goldman Sachs International, J.P. Morgan Securities plc, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. International plc, Merrill Lynch Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Swiss Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited and UK HSBC Saudi Arabia will also underwrite the IPO.</p>
      <p>Additionally, other banks include NCB Capital Company, Samba Capital &amp; Investment Management Company, Al Rajhi Capital, Banco Santander, S.A., BNP PARIBAS, BOCI Asia Limited, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, Deutsche Securities Saudi Arabia, EFG Hermes KSA, First Abu Dhabi Bank PJSC, GIB Capital, Mizuho International plc, RBC Europe Limited, Riyad Capital, Saudi Fransi Capital, SMBC Nikko Capital Markets Limited, Societe Generale, UBS AG and London Branch.</p>
      <p>Last week, the nation's Capital Markets Authority <a href="https://sputniknews.com/analysis/201911051077232252-aramco-ipo-the-last-resort-for-riyadh-to-lift-ailing-saudi-economy---prof/">announced that they had agreed</a> to approve Saudi Aramco's request to partially place shares; first on the local Tadawul stock market, and then abroad, up to a total of 5 percent of company shares.</p>
      <p>According to media reports, share trading will commence on 11 December.</p>
      <p>Security concerns in the region are reported to be diminishing the attractiveness of the IPO to institutional investors, lowering the listing price on the kingdom’s stock exchange.</p>
      <p>Company oil facilities in Abqaiq and Khurais <a href="https://sputniknews.com/business/201911031077214134-saudi-aramcos-net-profit-for-9-months-amounts-to-68bln---company/">were attacked</a> and partially destroyed in September, which temporarily cut Saudi oil production by half and resulted in a decrease of 5 percent in the world's oil output. Although the facilities have largely been repaired concern over vulnerability remains, especially amid the ongoing war currently being waged by Riyadh and its partners against the Houthi political movement in Yemen and other tensions with regional neighbors.</p>
      <p>Saudi Aramco, however, does not expect the drone attacks on its facilities to negatively affect its business or financial results, the company's prospectus said.</p>
