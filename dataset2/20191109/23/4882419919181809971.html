      <h2>More tests on Sunday will determine the severity of the knock</h2>

      <p>FC Barcelona have confirmed that Nelson Semedo was taken off with a calf problem during Saturday's 4-1 win over Celta Vigo in La Liga.</p>
      <p>Semedo was taken off in the 24th minute, replaced by Sergio Busquets, with Sergi Roberto moving to right-back, but it wasn't clear if he'd suffered a problem straight away.</p>
      <p>However, Barça have confirmed that the Portuguese was taken off with a "calf injury and will undergo more tests to determine the severity of the problem."</p>
      <p>The injury to Semedo is the 17th suffered by Barça this season, with 12 players suffering, with the likes of Jordi Alba getting repeat injuries.</p>
      <p>If Semedo is not fit for the game against Leganes after the international break, Ernesto Valverde may have to turn to Moussa Wague with Sergi Roberto suspended after picking up his fifth booking of the season.</p>
