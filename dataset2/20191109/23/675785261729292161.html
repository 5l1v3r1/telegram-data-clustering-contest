      <h1>Arsenal chief Raul Sanllehi 'contacts Luis Enrique' as pressure increases on Unai Emery</h1>
      <h2>The Gunners have not won in five games after their 2-0 defeat to Leicester City on Saturday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T23:02:11+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 23:02</time> by <a rel="author">Hassan Rashed</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal have made contact with former Spain and Barcelona manager Luis Enrique as pressure continues to mount on Unai Emery, according to reports.</p>
      <p>The Gunners dropped to sixth in the Premier League with a 2-0 loss at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> City on Saturday, which has left the North London club eight points outside the top four.</p>
      <p>The defeat at the King Power Stadium was the latest in a string of poor results for Emery's side, who have failed to win their last five games in all competitions.</p>
      <p>Those disappointing displays have increased scrutiny on the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> boss, with many of the club's fans calling on the Spaniard to be sacked.</p>
      <p>And reports in Spain have suggested that the club are already making plans to find a replacement.</p>

      <p>Enrique has been out of work since leaving the Spain in June for personal reasons just before his nine-year-old daughter Xana passed away from bone cancer.</p>
      <p>His three years at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> saw him lead the Catalan club to back-to-back La Liga titles and lift the Champions League trophy in the 2014-15 season.</p>
      <p>Following Saturday's defeat to Leicester, which saw strikes from James Maddison and Jamie Vardy lift Brendan Rodgers' side to second in the Premier League, Emery <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/unai-emery-issues-defiant-message-20850307">denied suggestions</a> his job is under threat.</p>

      <p>Instead, the Spaniard used his post-match press conference to call for patience from fans.</p>
      <p>"For me, as a coach, it's about continuing stronger and improving with our players," he said.</p>
      <p>"I am speaking with the club to stay calm and to stay patient to improve and recover some confidence with some circumstances.</p>

      <p>"We are receiving criticism but I know that's my job. I've had lots of moments like that but I've recovered by working to get confidence, being together with the club and players.</p>
      <p>"I accept all (of the criticism). I accept the applause and I accept it when they criticise us. I know when we win, they are going to be happy and when we lose, they are going to be sad. It's normal.</p>
      <p>"We need to stay calm and also keep improving things. Today we got one step ahead by being together and being strong defensively. But we lost because we were playing a very strong team in a good moment."</p>
