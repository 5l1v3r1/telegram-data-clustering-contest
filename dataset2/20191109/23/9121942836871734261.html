      <p>The Eastern Washington men’s basketball team went on an 11-1 run in the second half and beat host Seattle University 74-66 on Saturday night at the Redhawk Center.</p>
      <p>Junior Jacob Davison led the Eagles (2-0) with 25 points, and sophomore Kim Aiken Jr. equaled the fourth-best rebounding performance in school history with 19 boards to go along with 11 points.</p>
      <p>Senior Tyler Kidd and Aiken each scored nine second-half points, and Davison had 13. Aiken had 14 boards after intermission.</p>
      <p>Terrell Brown had team-high totals of 31 points and 13 rebounds for the Redhawks (1-2), who are coached by former Eastern Washington coach Jim Hayford.</p>
      <p>Eastern trailed at halftime 36-30 but outscored the Redhawks 44-30 in the second half.</p>
      <p>“It wasn’t a pretty game, but we got it done and the guys in our locker room are very, very excited,” Eastern coach Shantay Legans said.</p>

      <p>Eastern trailed by nine points early in the second half and was shooting at less than a 30% clip before tying the score at 45.</p>
      <p>Both teams are likely to work on their three-point shooting: Eastern was 6 for 31 (19%) and Seattle U was 3 of 17 (18%) from long range.</p>
      <h3>SU women lose</h3>
      <p>LOGAN, Utah – The Seattle University women’s team fell 70-63 at Utah State.</p>
      <p>But Seattle U senior Kamira Sanders tallied her 1,000th career point in the nonconference contest.</p>
      <p>Sanders set a new career high in scoring for the second straight game, pouring in 30 points. A late free throw gave her 28 points, making her the 18th player in program history to score at least 1,000 in her career.</p>
      <p>“It was just sheer determination from Kamira tonight,” said coach Suzy Barcomb. “She was getting to the rim, she was shooting well from three, and she only committed three turnovers.”</p>
