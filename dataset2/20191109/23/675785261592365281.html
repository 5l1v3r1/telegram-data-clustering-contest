      <p>The X Factor: Celebrity viewers have noticed a hilarious trend over the past couple of weeks, or so they claim.</p>
      <p>Nicole Scherzinger brings the glam every week with her incredible frocks during the live shows.</p>
      <p>She's not alone though, as her act Jenny Ryan has also been seen in some pretty extravagant outfits when taking to the stage.</p>
      <p>But some viewers have noticed that for the past two weeks, Jenny and her mentor have donned very similar looks.</p>
      <p>Now, some viewers are mocking the situation and joking the pair are sharing material, or even copying each other's show styles.</p>

      <p>This was echoed by another viewer who asked: "Is Jenny wearing the other half of Nicole's dress..."</p>
      <p>But jokes aside, some fans thought there was some sort of trend going on with the ladies.</p>
      <p>A viewer commented: "Jenny wearing bits of Nicole's dress two weeks in a row."</p>

      <p>Another added: "Quick question, why does Jenny always dress like Nicole?"</p>
      <p>There was double elimination drama as No Love Lost and Martin Bashir were sent home.</p>
      <p>But Simon Cowell quickly decided to introduce a new wildcard twist, announcing one eliminated act will return for the live final.</p>
