      <p>The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld the disqualification of 17 Congress-JD(S) MLAs in Karnataka on orders of the Speaker but allowed them to contest the December 5 bypolls.</p>
      <p>The court struck down the portion of the Speaker's order by which the legislators were disqualified till the end of the 15th <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/karnataka-assembly">Karnataka Assembly.</a></p>
      <p>The apex court's verdict paved way for the disqualified MLAs to contest the December 5 bypolls in Karnataka.</p>
      <p>A three-judge bench of justices N V Ramana, Sanjiv Khanna and Krishna Murari said if elected in bypolls, these disqualified MLAs can become ministers or hold public office.</p>
      <p>The bench deprecated the manner in which the disqualified MLAs directly approached it without first moving high court.</p>
      <p>The court said its verdict is based on facts and circumstance of case and does not interfere in the Speaker's power to disqualify members.</p>
      <p>The top court passed the verdict on petitions filed by these disqualified MLAs.</p>
