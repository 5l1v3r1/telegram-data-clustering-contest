        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya Nov 13 – Kenya Airports Authority (KAA) has denied reports in Sky News that identified the Kenya Airways stowaway who fell from a plane into a London garden earlier this year.</b>
      </p>
      <p>While Sky News named the stowaway as Paul Manyasi, who worked for cleaning company Colnet, Kenya Airports Authority says the name does not appear on the airport’s Pass Bio Metric Register.</p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>“A security multiagency team has conducted investigations on the allegations made in the (Sky) news article to the effect that the stowaway worked at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport and would like to state that the identity of the stowaway is an open and active investigation and any information received will be investigated to ensure a factual conclusion,” KAA said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“The name Paul Manyasi does not appear in the airport pass biometric register,” it added.</p>
      <p>The British broadcaster said it had tracked down the girlfriend of the 29-year-old, who has been missing since July, and confirmed that he worked as a cleaner at the airport.</p>
      <p>According to Sky News, the pair worked as cleaners at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport.</p>
      <p>Manyasi would have endured sub-zero temperatures in the aircraft’s outer mechanisms.</p>
      <p>UK police believe he was already dead when he dropped out of the landing gear compartment of the plane – where a bag, water and some food were found when it landed.</p>
      <p>Last month, the Metropolitan Police in London published an e-fit image of what they thought the victim looked like before he fell from the plane based on modern technology.</p>
