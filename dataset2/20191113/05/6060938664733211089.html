      <h1>Will be tough for Bangladesh without Shakib and Tamim: Sunil Joshi</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T05:11:18+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 05:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-Ruchir-Mishra-479203379.cms" target="_blank">Ruchir Mishra</a></address>
      <p>INDORE: Would it have served Bangladesh better had <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sunil-Joshi">Sunil Joshi</a> continued as their spin coach. Their spinners have done well under Joshi's guidance in the last two years.</p>
      <p>With a big series against India, Joshi, a former India left-arm spinner, could have provided useful insights not only to Bangladesh spinners but also to the batsmen. After all, he knows these conditions well.</p>
      <p>Having been associated with the game in different capacities for three decades, Joshi knows about almost all the venues in the country. The former Karnataka skipper, however, doesn't think on those lines. Joshi is happy with the work he has done with Bangladesh spinners but feels they would need runs on the board.</p>
      <p>"It's a strong Indian batting line-up. Recently, they have shown how ruthless they can be. To put India under pressure, first of all you need runs on the board. With Shakib (Al Hasan) and Tamim (Iqbal) not in the side, it won't be easy for Bangladesh, especially against an all-round Indian attack. Even at home, they don't rely only on spinners now. Look what their pacers did during the South Africa series," Joshi told TOI</p>
      <p>"Tamim, Shakib, Mushfiqur (Rahim), <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Mahmudullah">Mahmudullah</a> and skipper Mominul (Haque) are their experienced players. You might see a bit of resistance here and there. Others will have to raise their game by quite a few notches. They have to come with a different mindset in the Test matches. They need to be smarter in their approach. Merely going after the bowling won't help. Batsmen will have to show patience, while bowlers will have to be smarter and disciplined. They need to adapt better," he felt.</p>
      <p>Joshi knows it would be a challenge for young Bangladesh spinners against the experienced Indian batting line-up. The likes of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Taijul-Islam">Taijul Islam</a>, Mehedy Hasan and Nayeem Hasan have their task cut out.</p>
      <p>"Taijul would spearhead this attack. He is very consistent. If you look at his record in the last four or five Tests, he has four to five five-wicket hauls against different teams. Mehdi has better talent and skills, but Taijul is more experienced. He picks wickets, but also goes for runs and he needs to check this against India, who have a solid batting line-up. Nayeem is a smart bowler and can trouble batsmen. He gets extra bounce because of his height," he analysed.</p>
      <p>Joshi said Bangladesh would also miss Shakib as a bowler. "Shakib used to control the game and also pick wickets. It's a big loss for Bangladesh to miss such a talented player. Indian batsmen know how to play spin. It won't be easy against them," he said.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh also have some good pacers. The likes of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/mustafizur-rahman">Mustafizur Rahman</a>, Ibadat Hossain and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Al-Amin-Hossain">Al-Amin Hossain</a> have talent but Joshi said it's their ability to perform under pressure that will be tested in India. "Not many pacers of touring teams have enjoyed success here, which shows this isn't an ideal place for pacers. Besides, this is a young and inexperienced pace attack in Tests. They are still finding their feet at the international level. Ibadat bowled quickly in New Zealand and impressed in patches," he reckoned.</p>
