      <p>VANCOUVER — Elias Pettersson celebrated his 21st birthday with a pair of goals as the Vancouver Canucks ended a four-game winless streak with a 5-3 win over the Nashville Predators Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Tanner Pearson also scored twice for Vancouver, his second into an empty net. Adam Gaudette got the other for the Canucks (10-6-3), who are 1-3-1 in their last five games. Vancouver scored three times on the power play.</p>
      <p>Filip Forsberg scored twice for the Predators (9-6-3). Calle Jarnkrok also scored for Nashville.</p>
      <p>A wild third period saw the teams combine for six goals.</p>
      <p>Pettersson’s first goal came at 6:09 of the third. With the Canucks on a power play, Pettersson knocked down an attempted clearing pass with his chest. He gained control of the puck, took a couple of strides, then ripped a shot over the glove of Nashville goaltender Pekka Rinne.</p>
      <p>His second of the night, and eighth of the season, came off the rebound on a rush at 11:41.</p>

      <p>Forsberg scored twice in the third. He tipped a Mattias Ekholm shot past Vancouver goaltender Thatcher Demko at 8:35 and then scored his 10th of the year on a one-timer at 14:26.</p>
      <p>Demko made 34 saves for the Canucks. Rinne stopped 21 shots for Nashville.</p>
      <p>The teams exchanged goals during a second period that saw the Predators outshoot the Canucks 19-7.</p>
      <p>Pearson opened the scoring for Vancouver just 85 seconds into the period on a power play. Gaudette fed a streaking Pearson the puck and he beat Rinne on the blocker side for his third goal of the season and first in 15 games.</p>
      <p>Jarnkrok tied the game at 13:35. Matt Duchene fired a shot that Demko stopped but gave up a big rebound. Jarnkrok put the loose puck into the net for his sixth goal of the year.</p>
      <p>After giving up the early goal the Predators controlled much of the play and peppered Demko with shots. The Vancouver goalie faced a pair of breakaways in a 20-second span. First Craig Smith put a shot over the net, then Demko blocked a Mikael Granlund shot.</p>
      <p>Early in the third period Kyle Turris was alone in front of the net but Demko stopped the shot with a left pad.</p>
      <p>Rinne made a couple of big saves during a scoreless first period. He got a right pad on a shot from Sven Baertschi who was alone at the side of the net. Later, he made a glove save on a shot after Josh Leivo had stolen the puck from a Nashville defender.</p>
