      <h1>Nigerians fume as Senate considers Hate Speech, Internet Falsehood laws</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T05:00:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author">Abdur Rahman Alfa Shaban</a></address>
      <p>Nigerian lawmakers are considering a law to combat hate speech in Africa’s most populous nation. The move has however attracted stern criticism.</p>
      <p>The proposed law seeks to establish a National Commission for the Prohibition of Hate Speech. The bill has since passed the first reading in the upper chamber of parliament, the Senate.</p>
      <p>It makes a return to the chamber after the last Senate failed to have it passed in 2017. The then Senate president blocked the bill following backlash from the bill.</p>
      <p>It is sponsored by the Senate’s Deputy Chief Whip, Aliyu Sabi Abdullahi. According to reports, the lawmaker had proposed death penalty for persons found guilty of Hate Speech.</p>
      <p>Media outlets also report that details of the bill are yet to be made public but that the death penalty provision seems to have been maintained.</p>
      <p>Nigeria becomes the second African nation to move to combat hate speech in under a week. Ethiopia’s cabinet approved a similar legislation and referred it to lawmakers for final ratification.</p>
      <p>During his 59th Independence Day address in October 2019, President Buhari cautioned against hate speech whiles tasking citizens with tolerance of different view points.</p>
      <p>‘‘I reiterate my call for all to exercise restraint, tolerance and mutual respect in airing their grievances and frustrations,’‘ he stressed.</p>
