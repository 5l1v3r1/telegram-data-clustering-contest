      <h1>Arsenal 'hand trial' to MLS wonderkid Cole Bassett over prospective transfer</h1>
      <h2>Colorado Rapids teenager is to spend a week with Gunners' under-23s and hopes to show he can be a first-team player for Unai Emery's side</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T05:04:07+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 05:04</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal could be set to sign MLS rising star Cole Bassett after handing the Colorado Rapids midfielder a week-long trial.</p>
      <p>Bassett, 18, is a Gunners fan and is expected to train with Arsenal's under-18s during the international break.</p>
      <p>The teenager is hoping to impress in a bid to break into Unai Emery's first-team plans, according to the <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2019/11/11/cole-bassett-arsenal-training/">Denver Post</a> .</p>
      <p>“As most people already know, this is my favourite club," he told the publication.</p>
      <p>"I don’t know which team it will be because it’s an international break for them.</p>

      <p>"Hopefully, there will be a couple of guys missing with the first team and I can get with them.</p>
      <p>“But I’m just excited to get over there and show up basically.</p>
      <p>Bassett was impressed by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> when they played a friendly against Rapids.</p>
      <p>“When Arsenal came over here and played us, you could see there are little things that they do that I just don’t quite have yet,” Bassett said.</p>

      <p>“I’m eager to learn from them. Picking up things from every player will help improve my game. It’s going to be a great learning experience.”</p>
      <p>Colorado Rapids are owned by the Kroenkes, who also own Arsenal - and that would help grease the wheels of the transfer if Bassett impresses during his trial.</p>
      <p>Bassett broke into the Rapids' first team for the 2019 season after working his way through the club's youth system.</p>
      <p>He made 20 appearances in his breakthrough season, scoring twice.</p>
      <p>Rapids have already rejected interest in the player, with the Denver Post claiming that Freiburg made an offer for him after Bassett trained with the German club.</p>
      <p>According to football stats website <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.com/cole-bassett/profil/spieler/605144">Transfermarkt</a> he is valued at just £600,000 - so could prove a bargain if Arsenal decide to swoop for him in the January transfer window and Rapids can be persuaded to let him go.</p>
