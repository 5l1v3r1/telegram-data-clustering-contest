      <p><b>Gaza City:</b> Israel killed a senior Islamic Jihad commander in Gaza on Tuesday in a resumption of pinpointed targeting that threatens a fierce round of cross-border violence with Palestinian militants. Minutes after the Iranian-backed group confirmed the death of the commander, Bahaa Abu el-Atta, at dawn, barrages of rockets could be heard fired toward southern Israel from Gaza.</p>
      <p>The Islamic Jihad said Abu el-Atta, 42, was undergoing "a heroic act" when he was assassinated. It did not elaborate, but vowed revenge. Gaza's Health Ministry said a man and a woman were killed in an airstrike at a house and two other people were wounded. The airstrike damaged the half of the second and most of the third floors of a house in the Shejaeya neighbourhood east of the city. In a statement, the Israeli military said Abu el-Atta was responsible for recent rocket attacks against southern Israel communities, instructed by Tehran.</p>
