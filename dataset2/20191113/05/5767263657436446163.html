      <p>But the first insect Insta-blogger also has an important message behind all these pics - B was created by <a href="https://www.fondationdefrance.org/en">Fondation de France</a> in the summer 2019 to raise awareness and create a fundraising platform in order to save this insect from extinction.</p>

      <p>The bio <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bee_nfluencer/">says</a> "Follow me guys: the more followers I have, the more bees we will save!" As the Fondation de France has <a href="https://beefund.fondationdefrance.org/indexEN.html">stated</a>, all money raised will go to the bee fund to finance the rebuilding of habitats and educate people on the importance of bees in the global ecosystem.</p>
      <p>Bees are not just about honey, thanks to <a href="https://www.buzzaboutbees.net/10-Reasons-Why-Bees-Are-Important.html">their pollination</a> we have fruits, berries, nuts, and even roots and seeds. Here's what little B says "So, name a thing you love. Chocolate? I make it. Ice cream? I make it. Coffee? Always me. Broccoli? Me again. Clothes? Still me. We are behind most of the things you use every day!"</p>

      <p>The Fondation de France, which is the largest French philanthropic organization, <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fondation_de_France">was founded</a> in 1969 and now works not only within the country, but also throughout Europe, uniting specialists, volunteers, donors, and field operatives. <a href="https://beefund.fondationdefrance.org/indexEN.html">According</a> to the foundation, in France alone approximately 30% of bee colonies become extinct every year.</p>

      <p>Among other tasks, the fund also raises awareness about the harmful influence of pesticides on the insects and helps farmers switch to safe fertilizers. According to the organization <a href="https://friendsoftheearth.uk/bees/20-facts-you-need-know-about-bees">"Friends of the Earth"</a> the UK alone has lost 13 species of bees since the 1900s and the remaining 35 are now also in danger of extinction.</p>
