      <h1>Man Utd have first option on signing Memphis Depay from Lyon, Juninho confirms</h1>
      <h2>French club are braced for bids for Dutch winger, but United will have top priority if they match best offer</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T05:43:25+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 05:43</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United have first option on signing Memphis Depay from Lyon, the French club has confirmed.</p>
      <p>Depay, who has been linked with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> recently, didn't have the best time during his previous spell with United, scoring just two goals in 33 appearances between 2015 and 2017.</p>
      <p>However, the Dutch winger has impressed since joining Lyon from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">United</a> for £15million nearly three years ago, and has scored seven goals in 10 Ligue 1 appearances already this season.</p>
      <p>The club's director of football Juninho says £40m-rated <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/memphis-depay">Depay</a> is happy at Lyon, and he is likely to be offered a contract extension with his current deal due to expire in 2021.</p>
      <p>But with Lyon currently struggling in 14th place in Ligue 1, Depay's head could potentially be turned as the January transfer window looms.</p>

      <p>And if the 25-year-old shows no signs of wanting to sign a new contract, the French club could be tempted to cash in rather than lose him for nothing the following summer.</p>
      <p>And United will have first priority on a transfer if they can match any offers that come in, Juninho has confirmed.</p>
      <p>He told the club's <a href="https://www.ol.fr/fr-fr/contenus/articles/2019/11/12/juninho-dans-la-200eme-dol-night-system">official website</a> : "Manchester United has the priority if several clubs line up to buy him. But we have not received any offers so far. He is really happy right now in Lyon.</p>
      <p>“Rudi (Garcia) will soon make his decision. He is a technical leader. We will discuss an extension of contract by the end of the year.”</p>
      <p>United boss Ole Gunnar Solskaer is widely expected to strengthen his squad in January after the Red Devils endured a tough start to their Premier League campaign.</p>
      <p>However, an out-and-out striker is the club's priority.</p>
