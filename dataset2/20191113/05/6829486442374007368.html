      <h1>FKA Twigs’ New Album Is Devastating, So Fans Are Resorting To Memes To Cope</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T05:28:37+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 05:28</time> by <a rel="author">Jared Richards</a></address>
      <p>FKA twigs’ second album <i>Magdalene</i> arrived last week, and all the sites who have already published their Best Albums Of The Decade lists must be kicking themselves.</p>
      <p><i>Magdalene</i> is a crystallisation of not just one of the 2010’s most forward-thinking artists, but of the decade’s music itself.</p>

      <p>Mixing glitched-out R&amp;B, icy trap, and all-in emotions, twigs creates a sonic world coloured by pain, resilience and a stunning soprano. Better yet, it’s backed by a conceptual and genuinely essential multi-media framework of video <a href="https://junkee.com/fka-twigs-vivid-sydney-review/209171">and performance</a> that adds historical resonance to twigs’ personal struggle.</p>
      <p><i>Magdalene</i> is named after one of the Bible’s most divisive figures, and in her music and pole-dancing heavy performances, twigs plays with the Madonna-whore complex to explore the depths of her own emotions — enveloping the listener, bigger than them both.</p>

      <p>Then there’s the context too. twigs’ last release pre-<i>Magdalene</i> was stand-alone single ‘Good To Love’ in 2016, a song about pushing past a belief she was undeserving of love.</p>
      <p>In the time since, she’s had a well-documented break-up with Robert Pattinson, a relationship that catapulted her to attention she’d never seen — including racist abuse from some of Pattinson’s fans who preferred him with <i>Twilight</i> co-star Kirsten Stewart.</p>

      <p>In addition (and arguably much more importantly), she underwent surgery for the removal of fibroids from her uterus — something which led twigs, a trained dancer, to take up pole dancing as a way to rebuild strength, and reclaim her own body as no longer an enemy.</p>
      <p>The video for lead single ‘Cellophane’ ties everything together. It sees twigs fall and dance down an endless pole on-stage, receiving cheers and jeers as she continues to perform while her world literally falls apart, all the while singing, “<i>Why didn’t I do it for you?</i>“. If you haven’t seen it, stop everything right now and just watch (and clock the hand holding hers at 3.15 before letting go).</p>

      <p>All this is to say, <i>Magdalene</i> hits hard. Really, <i>really</i> hard: and as we’re wont to do, we’ve all collectively decided to make memes about it as a way to cope. There are a few strands to the reactions — a lot focus on the sad pole-dancing energy of it all.</p>

      <p>Elsewhere, people are zoning in on how each song relates to R-Patz. As a darling of auteurs and cinephiles alike, the actor is conjuring a lot of feelings for twigs’ fans, who either feel split loyalty or just want to beat him down.</p>

      <p>In short, if your week has absolutely ruined/made by <i>Magdalene</i>, you’re not alone: consider each meme the internet’s way of saying they’re “<i>running down the hills/to be with you</i>“.</p>
