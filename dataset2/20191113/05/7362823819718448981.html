      <h1>UMass guard Sean East hits amazing shot from other end of court</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T05:27:08+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 05:27</time> by <a rel="author">Dom Calicchio</a></address>
      <p>With less than a second left on the clock before the end of the first half, there was little that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa-bk">UMass</a> guard Sean East II could do Tuesday night except fire away from his team’s own end of the court.</p>
      <p>So that’s what East did, heaving the ball toward the basket with his left hand – and hitting nothing but net, sending the Minutemen <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports">to the locker room</a> with a one-point lead over visiting Northeastern.</p>
