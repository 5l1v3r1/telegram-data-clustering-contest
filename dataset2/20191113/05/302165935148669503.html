      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 13 — Malaysia Debt Ventures Bhd (MDV) has committed more than RM50 million in funds under the National Fiberisation and Connectivity Plan-Vendor Development Programme (NFCP-VDP) to support the development of the digital economy.</p>
      <p>Chief executive officer, Nizam Mohamed Nadzri said MDV always play a role and to positively contribute to providing financing access in underserved areas within its mandate, specifically for projects undertaken by technology SMEs and startups.</p>
      <p>“This is exactly what the NFCP-VDP aims to achieve — to bridge the financing gap faced by smaller companies that might otherwise hinder their contributions to the success of the NFCP,” he said in a statement today.</p>
      <p>The programme is tailored to match the financing requirements of eligible technology companies that undertake any project related to the NFCP comprising contractors or sub-contractors and suppliers.</p>
      <p>With up to RM5.0 million in financing limit per application, the programme offers a competitive financing rate, simplified approval processes, a customised facility structure based on the contract requirements of each project, as well as a credit guarantee.</p>
      <p>The programme serves to cater to the financing needs of the appointed sub-contractors of anchor companies in completing their work such as the laying of fibre cables, cabinets, pedestal boxes, civil works including plinth, roadworks and trenching.</p>
      <p>As to date, it has financed more than 880 technology projects in the areas of ICT, green technology, biotechnology and emerging technology with more than RM11.8 billion in financing having been disbursed.</p>
      <p>In terms of the country’s network infrastructure development, MDV has helped to finance the building of more than 5,900 3G and 4G towers across Malaysia.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>MDV is also currently the only financier in Malaysia offering Venture Financing, the Shariah-compliant equivalent of the venture debt models used by more developed markets, for high-growth venture capital-backed technology startups. — Bernama</p>
