        <b>Kerala born footballer Sushant Mathew who played for ISL sides Kerala Blasters and Pune City FC retired from football on Monday. The Kerala lad's career was marred by injuries as he could only play fewer games for the ISL sides, although his solo goal in ISL for Kerala Blasters was a revelation.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Former Kerala Blasters footballer Sushant Mathew announced his retirement from professional football on Monday. The 41-year-old footballer played in ISL for the first two seasons with Kerala blasters and now-defunct Pune City. However, with injuries, he could only play fewer minutes for both sides.</p>
      <p>Sushant Mathew has played just 56 minutes for Kerala in four ISL games. However, the midfielder will be remembered for scoring his only one goal in ISL for Kerala Blasters in the ISL season 1 semifinal against arch-rivals Chennaiyin in a packed Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Kochi. The wonder goal is arguably one of the best goals for Kerala Blasters as the midfielder came off the bench and shot it past experienced Chennaiyin defence, which included Italian legend Alessandro Nesta and French World-cupper Mikael Silvestre, with his left foot. The goal sealed the game for Kerala 3-0.</p>
      <p>The midfielder then moved to Pune City FC the following season but with injuries, he could play six games and ended his ISL career. However, he last played for his home side Gokulam Kerala in the I-League 2017-18 season.</p>
      <p>Sushant started his youth career with FC Kochin, playing with the legend I M Vijayan. He then went on to play with Vasco SC, Mahindra United, debuted for East Bengal in the 2011 AFC Cup and later played for clubs like Mohun Bagan, NEROCA FC and Rangdajied United FC.</p>
