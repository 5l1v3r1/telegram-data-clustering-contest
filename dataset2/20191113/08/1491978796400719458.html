      <h1>Football transfer rumours: Moise Kean and Granit Xhaka to Milan?</h1>

        <i>Today’s fluff will forever be remembered for cupping the touch</i>
      </p>
      <p>With no goals in 11 appearances and a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/12/moise-kean-dropped-everton-southampton-club-rules">late arrival for a team meeting</a> having blotted his copybook, <b>Moise Kean</b> could be forgiven for thinking his move to Everton has started badly. And if he isn’t he better start thinking that way soon because Mino Raiola is his agent and he waits for no man.</p>
      <p>The man who once <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/apr/07/paul-pogba-mino-raiola-pep-guardiola">branded Pep Guardiola ‘a coward and a dog’</a> in a war of words over Paul Pogba is apparently exploring possible exit routes for the 19-year-old forward who only landed in the Premier League three months ago. Milan are at the head of the queue for the Italy international who was excelling for Juventus last season before a surprise move to Goodison Park. Talks have already taken place and are set to get serious, if you believe the reports in Kean’s homeland.</p>
      <p>Hopefully Raiola has got a few properties in his <b>Milan</b> portfolio because <b>Granit Xhaka</b> has been busy house hunting in the city prior to his own planned move to the Serie A strugglers. The Swiss midfielder is so fed up with being stripped of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal">Arsenal</a> captaincy and abused by the fans he is willing to link up again with Ivan Gazidis at the <i>Rossoneri.</i></p>
      <p>Ronald Koeman has kindly issued a come and get me plea in the name of <b>Memphis Depay </b>after the Lyon forward was linked with a £50m move to <b>Tottenham</b>. “The fact that he doesn’t play for the biggest team in the world clearly doesn’t have consequences for his place in the national team.” said the Netherlands manager. “But if he plays at a bigger club, that will also be better for us.”</p>
      <p>Never go back, they say, in a phrase that means diddly-squat in the gilded corridors of Old Trafford. Despite the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/09/manchester-united-sign-paul-pogba-93-million-juventus">£93m return of Pogba</a> still proving to be little more than an alarming distraction for <b>Manchester United</b>, Ed Woodward has flipped open his chequebook and is ready to scrawl down another princely sum for a former player who left with the hump. <b>Wilfried Zaha</b> is the man in question and will cost a cool £70m.</p>
      <p><b>Tahith Chong</b> has decided he wants out of United and could follow in Pogba’s footsteps by heading to <b>Juventus</b>. The highly-regarded 19-year-old Dutchman has less than a year left on his contract and will not be short of offers in January. And so the wheel turns.</p>
