      <h2>EastEnders didn't hold back on the nostalgia on Tuesday night, as Walford histories collided leading to the potential death of Mel Owen</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T08:02:45+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 08:02</time> by <a rel="author">Charlotte Tutton</a></address>
      <p>EastEnders aired horrifying scenes on Tuesday night, as Mel Owen and Sharon Mitchell's dramatic car chase potentially led to a shock death.</p>
      <p>Mel's desperation for revenge against the Mitchell clan may have cost her her life, as she finally prepared to expose Sharon in the most iconic and nostalgic way - Sharongate volume two.</p>
      <p>Sharon had an affair with son-in-law Keanu Taylor and is now pregnant with his child - while Phil believes he is the father.</p>
      <p>Keanu is also expecting a baby with Phil's daughter, his fiancée, Louise Mitchell - who happens to be Mel's Goddaughter - while few people currently know about the fling that is about to be exposed.</p>
      <p>Mel discovered the truth recently and has been blackmailing Sharon ever since.</p>

      <p>On Tuesday night, she set the scene for the big reveal as she planned a surprise joint birthday party for for Louise and Sharon.</p>
      <p>Her plan the entire time was to get to Phil before Sharon and confirm the truth about the baby and Keanu.</p>
      <p>She had to make other plans though when Louise's mother Lisa Fowler, yet to discover the full truth about Sharon's secret, begged her best friend of 20 plus years to stop her deadly plan - fearing Phil would want revenge.</p>
      <p>With Sharon sneaking out and driving towards the airport where Phil was about to land, Mel realised and took Louise's car and phone and then commenced a car chase.</p>

      <p>While in the car, Mel called Billy Mitchell who was still at the club and asked him to put the phone to the microphone on the sound system ready to reveal all to Louise and everyone else in the club.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately for Mel she ended up crashing her car and is now feared dead, with Thursday set to reveal the fallout.</p>
      <p>But the episode wasn't just full of drama - there were also a series of nods to the past and epic storylines involving Mel, Sharon, Phil, Lisa and even Louise.</p>
      <p>First off, Mel's plan to out Sharon via a sound system to an audience is nothing new - it mirrors Sharongate from 1994.</p>
      <p>Viewers loved the nod to the past, with the original storyline seeing Sharon's affair with now-husband Phil exposed to her then-husband Grant Mitchell.</p>

      <p>But it wasn't just revealed in any old fashion - it was in fact announced via an audio recording played out to the entire pub.</p>
      <p>That wasn't the only Sharongate nod though, with pictures from Sharon's younger days hanging all around the club - the club which used to be owned by her adoptive father Den Watts.</p>
      <p>Speaking of Den, he and wife Angie also featured in photos in the club - they had their own fair share of marriage drama.</p>
      <p>There was also constant referencing back to Lisa and Mel's long-time friendship, with them often helping each other in times of need - and this time around Lisa was desperate for her friend to let her in.</p>

      <p>One moment in the past where this came into play was Mel and husband Steve Owen trying to help Lisa and baby Louise flee to Portugal - the exact location Mel has been so desperate to return to with the two ladies.</p>
      <p>But the moment ended in tragedy when Phil and Steve became embroiled in a deadly car chase, leading to Steve's car exploding and killing him.</p>
      <p>Fast-forward to 2019, and the episode on Tuesday ended with another Mitchell vs Owen feud leading to a car chase between two members of the opposing families, before a cliffhanger saw Mel potentially dead after a horrifying crash.</p>
      <p>Not to mention that once again poor Louise was caught up in the Owen vs Mitchell drama - and then there was Lisa's own reference to Sharongate when she told Louise's stepmother that she "doesn't change".</p>
