      <h1>Smyths Toys customers convinced 2019 Christmas advert sees boy say 'fat b*****d'</h1>

      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T08:27:18+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 08:27</time> by <a rel="author">James Rodger, https://www.facebook.com/jamesrodgerjournalist</a></address>
      <p>Stunned TV viewers have been left utterly convinced a Christmas advert for the 2019 festive season features a rude word.</p>
      <p>Many shoppers, customers and consumers have been left commenting on Smyths Toys' advert.</p>
      <p>The ad for the toy firm, which operates stores across Birmingham and the Black Country, was released this week.</p>
      <p>It joins the likes of Sainsbury's, Asda and Aldi - as well as Debenhams, Very and Argos - in setting the tone ahead of December.</p>
      <p>But eagle-eyed fans of the brand have been left speculating it contains an "unacceptable" word.</p>
      <p>The 40-second trailer features a young boy called Oscar.</p>
      <p>In the ad, Oscar sings about his dream of being a toy instead of human to the tune of Beyonce's 2008 hit 'If I Were a Boy'.</p>

      <p>When little Oscar points a toy gun at Pokemon character Pikachu as he whizzes around his local branch of Smyths Toys Superstores, he says: "I'd master the fart blaster for sure."</p>
      <p>But speculation on social media has asked whether he instead says: "I’d master the fat b*****d for sure".</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"Your advert is totally unacceptable for a child's toy store with it calling someone a fat b*****d," one customer fumed at Smyths.</p>
      <p>ASA have responded to confirm they did receive a complaint about the ad as the complainant believed it sounded like the boy who was singing uses a swear word.</p>

      <p>"Please someone tell me what the lyrics are to the smyths advert because all I can hear is "I've mastered the fat b*****d," another wrote.</p>
      <p>A third chipped in with: "Is it me or does the little boy on the smyths advert call pikachu a fat b*****d."</p>
