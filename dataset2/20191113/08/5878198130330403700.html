      <p>As clinical psychologist James Fallon argues, dictators are usually bent on identifying themselves with “the people”. They believe they are embodiments of the hopes and values of some significant majority they preside over.</p>
      <p>Paradoxically, these dictators are also very paranoid about having to reveal their humanity. To show they are just like everyone else they claim to represent betrays a vulnerability that is not on-brand with a dictator’s image.</p>
      <p>Yet, they are human, and just like every other one of us, dictators have fears, weaknesses as well as hopes and strengths.</p>
      <p>What dictators also have are things they like to do as hobbies. And as these five African dictators show, sometimes these “strong men” find joy in simple pleasures.</p>
