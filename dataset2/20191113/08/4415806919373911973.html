      <p>Venice’s mayor blamed climate change for the “dramatic situation” and called for a speedy completion of a long-delayed project to construct offshore barriers.</p>
      <p>Called Moses, the moveable under-sea barriers are meant to limit flooding of the lagoon city, caused by southerly winds that push the tide into Venice.</p>
      <p>Mayor Luigi Brugnaro said the flood levels represent “a wound that will leave indelible signs”.</p>
