      <p>Ahead of the imminent launch of Apple's new 16-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a>, several benchmark results have appeared on <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/search?q=MacBookPro16%2C1">Geekbench</a> that allegedly come from a Mac model designated "MacBookPro16,1" and, if true, confirm some of the machine's rumored hardware specifications.</p>

      <p>Many of the results indicate that the 16-inch ‌MacBook Pro‌ will feature Intel 9th-generation Coffee Lake Refresh processors, which would be in line with the 15-inch ‌MacBook Pro‌ released in May. Some benchmarks show an 8-core Core i9 processor with a 2.4GHz base clock speed. <br/><br/>In addition, <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/compute/240983">OpenCL scores</a> list the machines as having Radeon Pro 5300M and 5500M graphics, and up to 32GB RAM. We've spotted references to Radeon Pro 5300M and 5500M in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-10-15/">macOS Catalina</a> code, so there's a good chance these are legit.</p>
