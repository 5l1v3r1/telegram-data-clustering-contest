      <p>As of Wednesday, eight people are still hospitalized. The Home Front Command instructed communities in the south to keep schools closed today and non-essential workers are asked to remain home.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, the special emergency-situation extended to the center of the country, on orders of newly appointed Defense Minister Naftali Bennett, but that decision has since been reversed and there are no special provisions or restrictions on the civilian population in light of events. However, everyone is urged to comply with Home Front Command instructions as they are issued.</p>
