      <h1>How to use your iPad as a PC monitor with the Duet Display App</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T08:15:56+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 08:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/sydneybutler/" target="_blank">Sydney Butler</a></address>
      <p>Long before Apple introduced <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/06/03/macos-catalina-ipad-os-sidecar-compatible-apps/">Sidecar</a> in macOS Catalina, the paid <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/duet-display/id935754064">Duet Display</a> app has provided a lag-free way to use an iPad to extend the desktop of a Mac or PC. While Sidecar has largely rendered Duet Display unnecessary for Mac and iPad owners, it’s still useful for getting the same functionality from your iPad paired with a Windows PC.</p>
      <p>Sidecar hasn’t completely rendered Duet Display obsolete. Sidecar only works with a <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/10/07/macos-catalina-ipad-sidecar/">select combination of Mac and iPad models</a>. In contrast, Duet Display will work with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Macs running macOS 10.9+</li>
        <li>Windows PCs running Windows 7+</li>
        <li>iPhones and iPads running iOS10+</li>
        <li>Android and Chromebook devices running Android 7.1+</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Yes, that’s right. If you have an old Android tablet laying around, you can even use it as an extended display for your Mac! The Android version of the app is right <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kairos.duet">here</a>.</p>
      <p>The specific combination we’re going to use here is a Windows 10 PC and an iPad Pro, but the general process is pretty much the same.</p>
      <h3>How to use your iPad as a PC monitor with the Duet Display App</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Purchase the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/duet-display/id935754064">Duet Display app</a></li>
        <li>Download and install the <a href="https://updates.duetdisplay.com/latestWindows">Duet Display client for Windows</a> (or <a href="https://updates.duetdisplay.com/latestMac">Mac</a>)</li>
        <li>Start the Duet Display app on iPad</li>
        <li>Connect the iPad to the computer via USB</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>1. Purchase the Duet Display App</h3>
      <p>The Duet Display application costs $9.99 at the time of this writing. That’s a once-off fee to own the basic version of the app. There are also two subscription-based tiers called “Air” and “Pro”. This enables wireless connectivity and in the Pro version also adds professional drawing pen features to the app.</p>
      <p>In truth, Duet is just about 100% reliable and almost lag-less using a wired connection. Both paid annual subscriptions have a short trial, but here we’re just sticking with the base experience. Navigate to the App Store on your iPad and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/duet-display/id935754064">buy the app</a> to proceed.</p>
      <h3>2. Download and install the client software</h3>
      <p>You can download the <a href="https://updates.duetdisplay.com/latestWindows">Windows</a> (or <a href="https://updates.duetdisplay.com/latestMac">Mac</a>) client software directly from the Duet Display website. Simply click the links and install the software as you would any other.</p>
      <h3>3. Start the Duet Display app on iPad</h3>
      <p>Tap the Duet Display app on your iPad and you should be greeted with this screen.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>4.Connect the iPad to the computer via USB</h3>
      <p>Now all you have to do is connect the tablet to the computer via USB. If you are asked to “trust” the computer, do so. After a few seconds your iPad should display an extended version of your desktop.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>As you can see in the above screenshot, the iPad’s 4:3 screen is to the right of the PC’s 21:9 display. The taskbar appears on both and touch input works as well. By clicking the Duet Display tray icon you can access its settings.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Here you can tune the frame rate, resolution and display quality as you please. Larger iPads may benefit from higher resolutions.</p>
      <p>Sidecar is a fantastic free addition to macOS, but still isn’t quite as flexible (or open to device mixing) as Duet Display.</p>
