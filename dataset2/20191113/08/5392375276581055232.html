      <p>Last month, Chinese smartphone maker <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/09/24/vivo-u10-with-snapdragon-665-5000mah-battery-announced/">Vivo introduced a new U series of Vivo phones to the India market</a>. The lineup which already has the Vivo U10 with trending design, monster battery with fast charging and above all else an aggressive price point is set to get a new entrant. Vivo is all now set to expand the <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/09/24/vivo-u3x-announce-in-china-its-a-rebranded-vivo-u10/">all new U series</a> with the unveiling of the Vivo U20 in India.</p>
      <p>As per an <a href="https://amzn.to/2NGhRfA">Amazon India teaser</a>, the Vivo U20 is all set to go be announced on November 22 at 12 pm. The online retailer has yet to spill the bean on the specs sheet. However, the teaser poster reveals that the Vivo U20 will retain the U10 design, so it more or less certain most of the upgrade will come internally. It has a waterdrop notch screen, triple rear cameras, gradient back and a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner.</p>
      <p>While the U10 is powered by a 2.0Ghz octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 665 processor, the U20 will get an upgraded Snapdragon 675. The same SoC powers the Vivo V15 Pro, V17 Pro, and even the Galaxy A70, but unlike these devices, the U20 is expected to be priced under Rs 15,000. The Vivo U20 should come with up to 6GB of RAM and UFS 2.1 storage.</p>
      <p>Aside from the triple camera setup, one of the key selling points of the U10 is its monster 5,000mAh battery with 18W dual-engine fast charging support which can offer up to 48hrts of battery life from a single charge, so the U20 should come with similar battery size, or even improve on that. Â Unfortunately, that is about all we know about the U20 for now, but we should expect more details to surface in the coming days.</p>
