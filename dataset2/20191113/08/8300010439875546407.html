      <p>DOWNEY, Calif. (KABC) -- A Downey family have their Christmas spirit back thanks to a letter written by a 9-year-old boy.<br/><br/>Each year, for the past four years, Nickole Jones and her family set up an elaborate display in the front yard of their Downey home. The theme: "The Nightmare before Christmas."<br/><br/>They've won city awards and have captured the attention of all ages.<br/><br/>But last year, the nightmare truly hit home when someone stole their decorations. The suspect was caught on security camera, but never identified.<br/><br/>"I was really, really angry and surprised someone would do something like that at Christmas time," said Jones, a hair stylist.<br/><br/>Jones says she was so upset, her family decided not to put up a display this year, until she received a letter in the mail.<br/><br/>The letter began: "Dear neighbors. Me and my family have a tradition going to your house and seeing the decorations. But ever since those people stole your decorations I have been very sad."<br/><br/>The letter was written by 9-year-old Santiago Macias who has stopped by Jones' display for the past four years.<br/><br/>"I love the music. I love all the decorations, I just loved everything," said Macias, a fourth grade student at Old River School in Downey.<br/><br/>Macias enclosed $20 with the letter. He says it was to help remake the decorations.<br/><br/>"I think you should not stop decorating because I love your house and I know children love it too," Macias wrote in his letter.<br/><br/>"Instantly something clicked in my head," said Jones. "We have to do this even if it's just for him. We're doing it."<br/><br/>Jones managed to track down the fourth grade student and invited him and his mother over to her home to look at some of the decorations up close.<br/><br/>"I was really happy," said Macias. "I was excited just to go see it."<br/><br/>Jones says it can take two to three days to create some of her pieces. She plans to have the final display finished by Dec. 2.<br/><br/>That's the day she promised Macias it would be lit up and ready - with even more characters than ever before.<br/><br/>"He gave us back our Christmas spirit for sure," said Jones with a huge smile.<br/><br/>"He reminded me why we did it," she said. "And then it made me think we can't let those people who took the stuff ruin it, when it's making people happy."</p>
