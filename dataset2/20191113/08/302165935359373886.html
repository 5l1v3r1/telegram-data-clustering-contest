      <p>LONDON, Nov 13 — European shares retreated from four-year highs today, as a highly anticipated speech by US President Donald Trump gave no new clues on the progress of a trade deal with China, and as anti-government protests in Hong Kong raged on, denting sentiment.</p>
      <p>The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.2 per cent after positive German investor sentiment data and a slew of upbeat earnings had helped it scale highs not seen since 2015 yesterday.</p>
      <p>Banks as well as trade sensitive auto and mining sectors were among the biggest decliners, along with media-related stocks.</p>
      <p>Satellite company SES slumped after a JP Morgan downgrade to neutral, while German commercial broadcaster ProSiebenSat.1 slid 2.5 per cent after Italy’s Mediaset said it could increase its stake in the German peer, but ruled out a full takeover.</p>
      <p>Spanish stocks led losses among regional peers as investors were doubtful of a new coalition between Socialists and far-left Unidas Podemos formed yesterday. The unexpectedly fast preliminary agreement was formed between two parties that recently refused to work together. — Reuters</p>
