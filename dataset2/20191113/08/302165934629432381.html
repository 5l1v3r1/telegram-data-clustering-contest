      <p>Among the other heavyweights, Maybank was down by 11 sen to RM8.68, Public Bank dropped eight sen to RM19.90 but Tenaga was 10 sen higher at RM13.78.</p>
      <p>Of the actives, Trive Property was flat at 1.5 sen, Netx and MTAG eased half-a-sen each to two sen and 61.5 sen, respectively.</p>
      <p>The FBM Emas Index slid 78.38 points to 11,322.62, the FBMT 100 Index lost 75.03 points to 11,138.59 and the FBM Emas Shariah Index decreased 76.61 points to 11,863.14.</p>
      <p>The FBM Ace contracted 32.53 points to 4,850.97 and the FBM 70 was 47.15 points lower at 14,090.80.</p>
