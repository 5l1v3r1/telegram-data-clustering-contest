      <p>Apple also announced that the new ‌Mac Pro‌ will be available with up to 8TB of SSD storage, after originally promising up to 4TB. <br/><br/>The base model ‌Mac Pro‌ starts at $5,999 and features an 8-core 3.5GHz Intel Xeon processor, a Radeon Pro 580X GPU, 32GB of RAM, and 256GB of SSD storage. Additional technical specifications and configure-to-order options are available on <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac-pro/">Apple's website</a>. <br/><br/>The high-throughput machine was originally announced in June, when Apple promised a "fall" release. Apple confirmed December today:</p>
      <blockquote>Today, Apple also announced that the all-new ‌Mac Pro‌, the world's best pro desktop, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/displays/">Apple Pro Display XDR</a>, the world's best pro display, will be available in December. Designed for maximum performance, expansion and configurability, ‌Mac Pro‌ features workstation-class Xeon processors up to 28 cores, a high-performance memory system with a massive 1.5TB capacity, eight PCIe expansion slots and a graphics architecture featuring the world's most powerful graphics card. Pro Display XDR features a 32-inch Retina 6K display with P3 wide and 10-bit color, 1,600 nits of peak brightness, 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio and a superwide viewing angle, all at a breakthrough price point.</blockquote>
      <p>Apple is also releasing the Pro Display XDR alongside the ‌Mac Pro‌ next month. The high-end monitor costs $4,999, or $5,999 for a version with a "nano-texture" matte coating. The stand costs $999 and a VESA mount costs $199. <br/><br/>Today's announcement was brief, and Apple stopped short of providing specific dates for ‌Mac Pro‌ and Pro Display XDR preorders and availability.</p>
