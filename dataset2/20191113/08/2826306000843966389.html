      <p>The Shilling’s movement was restricted within tight ranges as calm continued to engulf the local FX market on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>A state of equilibrium permeated as trivial dollar inflows matched corporate demand for foreign currency, leaving the USDUGX pair tucked within the previous ranges of 3685-3705.</p>
      <p>The currency pair is likely to continue trading within recent ranges albeit with a bullish tinge as activity on the foreign currency supply counter gradually picks up.</p>
      <p>The dollar traded sideways against its peers after U.S. President Donald Trump presented no new details on the state of trade talks with China in a speech on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The buck’s movement has been dominated by trade headlines recently, and lack of details in Trump’s highly anticipated speech was seen by the market as a pessimistic signal. The U.S. dollar index stayed range-bound at the 98.30 handles.</p>
      <p>The euro rose marginally against the dollar on Germany’s ZEW Economic Sentiment Survey that beat forecasts in November and rose to -2.1 from -22.8. The gains were however capped by ongoing fears of a technical recession by Europe’s largest economy in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>The Sterling was a touch softer against the dollar after the release of U.K. Preliminary GDP data, which came in worse-than-expected 0.3% compared to expectations of 0.4%.</p>
      <p>U.K Jobs data also showed falling employment, weaker wage growth and fewer vacancies, pointing to a weaker British outlook.</p>
