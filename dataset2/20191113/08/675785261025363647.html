      <h2>Ant McPartlin and his estranged wife Lisa Armstrong are battling it out between their lawyers as their 11-year marriage ends in animosity and pain</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T08:46:41+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 08:46</time> by <a rel="author">Emmeline Saunders</a></address>
      <p>Ant McPartlin's bitter divorce rows with Lisa Armstrong are at crisis point, after talks over how to split his £62million fortune ended in failure.</p>
      <p>While Ant jets out to Australia for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/im-a-celebrity-lineup-2019-14274681">I'm A Celebrity 2019</a> , Lisa is back home in the UK dealing with their respective lawyers as costs mount to a whopping £1.5million in legal letters.</p>
      <p>At the crux of their complaint is Lisa's unwillingness to sign a non-disclosure agreement - as Ant is said to be desperate to avoid a public washing of his laundry in open court.</p>
      <p>Lisa, however, is relishing the opportunity to finish her marriage in the High Court, and is telling pals she will never sign the gagging order designed to protect Ant's reputation from further damage.</p>

      <p>After a hellish year of two stints in rehab, a public battle with prescription drugs and booze, and his shameful drink-driving crash in March 2018, Ant is no doubt hoping the public will continue to support him.</p>
      <p>But without Lisa agreeing to sign the NDA, he's reportedly not signing off on a financial settlement until she complies.</p>
      <p>"Lisa is an honest, loyal and decent human being. She isn’t interested in how much money she gets," an insider told the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10333823/ant-mcpartlin-lisa-armstrong-divorce-gag-order/">Sun</a> .</p>

      <p>"She told her dad Derek on his death bed earlier this year that she would stand strong and she's not about to go back on her word."</p>
      <p>The source went on: "She won't sign an NDA. As far as she's concerned, he is welcome to his money.</p>
      <p>"It’s not about that for her. She's appalled at the way she has been treated ever since they split up, by people she loved, trusted and called friends."</p>

      <p>As the Mirror reported back in December last year, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/lisa-armstrong-axed-bgt-working-13710584">Lisa was axed from her freelance makeup job</a> on Britain's Got Talent after show bosses decreed it "untenable" for her to continue working in close proximity to Ant.</p>
      <p>The 43-year-old makeup artist was expecting to be dropped in favour of her ex, but was still gutted by the decision.</p>
      <p>It came six months after she found out via the press that Ant was in a new relationship with her friend and former personal assistant Anne-Marie Corbett.</p>
      <p>Lisa was left reeling when the couple went public and took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> to blast Anne-Marie for breaking the 'Girl Code'.</p>

      <p>It seems that has fuelled her determination not to be pushed over - and certainly not to sign Ant's NDA.</p>
      <p>A source close to the I'm A Celebrity host told the newspaper: "All correspondence goes through their lawyers, which is what Lisa requested.</p>
      <p>"Ant is not trying to pressure Lisa into signing an NDA. He will sign one too, of course.</p>
      <p>"But he doesn't want it going to court. Why would he? He's made her an incredibly generous offer and is hoping that they can move on."</p>
      <p>Mirror Online has contacted Ant's rep for comment.</p>
