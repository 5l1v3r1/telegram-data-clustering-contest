      <h1>SANParks take drastic steps to curb millions in fruitless and wasteful expenditure</h1>
      <h2>The annual SANParks financial report for 2018/19 indicated R198 million was irregularly spent.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T08:00:44+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Charl Pienaar</a></address>
      <p>The Auditor-General of South Africa (AGSA) commented in this report on management’s lack of monitoring compliance with applicable laws, which led to irregular spending.</p>
      <p>In terms of the report by the AGSA, 60 per cent of all transgressions were due to contracts being expanded or changed without adhering to due process in terms of Treasury regulations.</p>
      <blockquote>It was stated in the report that the main contributor to the increase in irregular expenditure, “is attributed to the clean-up of the contract management register”.<br/><br/><br/>Lowvelder questioned SANParks on the statement made and Reynold Thakhuli, SANParks acting head of corporate communications, responded. He stated, “The current system employed uses a manual contract register, which is not linked to the financial system that effects payment, therefore the system does not update in real-time when payments are made and it causes contract periods to be exceeded.”</blockquote>
      <p>Thakhuli further explained that the irregular expenditure disclosed in the ASFS incorporates accumulative sums from previous financial years. He declared that although this fruitless expenditure was incurred in contravention with supply chain management (SCM) requirements, the funds were spent in line with the objectives of the organisation.</p>

      </p>
      <p>SANParks specified that they are taking the following steps to avoid the reoccurrence of these contraventions by management staff:<br/>• The implementation of an effective real-time contract management system that will effectively communicate to the financial system to enforce adherance to the stipulated contract period<br/>• Project managers have been instructed to immediately request the extension and/or variation of contracts through the SCM to ensure compliance and same is recorded in the variation register</p>

      </p>
      <p>• Project managers must comply with all time frames and appoint new contractors at least six months before the expiry of contracts<br/>• Compliance with due process is being closely monitored and guidance are given to officials to facilitate compliance<br/>• SCM workshops will be conducted continuously to educate staff on the consequences of irregular expenditure<br/>• Wasteful expenditure will be reported to the executive committee on a quarterly basis to create awareness among managing executives and to discipline officials involved.</p>

      <p>The report by the AGSA also mentioned an independent consultant that investigated allegations of possible misappropriation of heritage assets. A report by the consultant was tabled to the SANParks Board on September 19, 2018.</p>
      <p>Lowvelder inquired if any criminal charges were instituted against the persons responsible for the misappropriation of assets.</p>
      <p>Thakhuli confirmed that no charges were laid, as no individual could be singled out as the culprit behind the loss of the unknown artefacts.</p>
      <blockquote>He said, “the final report of an independent investigation team had been handed over to law enforcement agencies for further investigation.” The recommendations by the board did include security upgrades and the removal of high-value artefacts from public displays until further notice.</blockquote>
