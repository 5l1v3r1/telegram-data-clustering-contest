      <h2>Chloe Bradley, who was 17 at the time, says she wishes "this whole thing would go away" after she arranged for her 27-year-old boyfriend, Anthony Roscoe, to rape the 12-year-old girl</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T08:01:01+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 08:01</time> by <a rel="author">Luke Traynor</a></address>
      <p>A teenager who arranged for her 27-year-old boyfriend to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/rape">rape</a> a 12-year-old girl has said "I did wrong" and revealed that "everyone is calling me a nonce".</p>
      <p>Chloe Bradley, then 17, conspired with Anthony Roscoe, 27, to bring the child to his home, where he had sex with the girl and Bradley in quick succession.</p>
      <p>Predator Roscoe, jailed for four years for rape, later told stunned detectives: “When somebody hands you the Holy Grail, you’re going to grab it, aren’t you?”</p>
      <p>Now, after Bradley, who supposedly has the emotional age of a 10-year-old, avoided jail for her part in the rape in August 2017, she has spoken to the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/teen-who-arranged-boyfriend-threesome-17244502">Liverpool Echo</a> about her actions and says she has “learned her lesson.”</p>

      <p>She said: “I accept I did something wrong. I’ve done my punishment.</p>
      <p>“Everyone is calling me a nonce.</p>
      <p>“I got a suspended sentence and I’ve learned my lesson. I was hanging around with the wrong people.”</p>
      <p>Bolton Crown Court heard how Bradley messaged her on-off boyfriend Roscoe, from St Helens, Merseyside, about a rendezvous and then escorted the young girl to his home.</p>

      <p>He alternated between having sex with Bradley and raping the 12-year-old victim, Bolton Crown Crown court heard.</p>
      <p>Police became involved by chance when a passing patrol spotted the girls leaving Roscoe’s home at 5.30am the next day.</p>
      <p>The 17-year-old’s phone was examined and was found to contain conversations between herself and Roscoe.</p>
      <p>Bradley, who served six months on remand in Styal Prison in Cheshire, described that experience as “horrible.”</p>

      <p>The Wigan teenager, who lives with her grandparents in Worsley Hall, said she met Roscoe online before he began to send her regular text messages.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the Echo yesterday, Bradley added: “In my head I’m 19 [she was 17 at the time of the offence] but I’m not an adult, I’m still a kid.</p>
      <p>“I just wish this whole thing would go away. I’d make different choices.</p>
      <p>“Roscoe isn’t the best of people, but I thought he was an alright lad before this happened. I’ve changed my opinion now.</p>

      <p>“It’s not good, everyone knows where I live now, and word has got round the estate.</p>
      <p>“I’m close to my grandparents and I’m sorry for what I did.”</p>
      <p>Bradley pleaded guilty to arranging the commission of a child sex offence and was given 22 months’ jail, suspended for a year.</p>
      <p>She was also ordered to wear an electronic tag for three months and sign the Sex Offender Register for 10 years.</p>

      <p>In mitigation for Roscoe, Michael Hagerty said: “He believed the complainant was 16 and the sexual activity was with ostensible consent.</p>
      <p>“Both Bradley and the complainant went to the defendant’s house, rather than the other way round. It’s clear both were of the clear intention of having sex with the defendant.</p>
      <p>In mitigation for Bradley, Paul Woods said: “She was 17 when the offences were committed.</p>
      <p>“Her functional age and her emotional and cognitive behaviour are described as that of a 10-year-old.</p>
      <p>“She is a very vulnerable individual.”</p>
      <p>Sentencing, Judge Graeme Smith said: “You told officers in your interview: ‘When somebody hands you the Holy Grail, you’re going to grab it, aren’t you?’.</p>
      <p>“I am quite satisfied the prospect of a threesome blinded you to everything else.”</p>
      <p>Roscoe was also made subject of a Sexual Harm Prevention Order for five years and ordered to sign the Sex Offender Register indefinitely.</p>
      <p>Bradley was also made subject of a Sexual Harm Prevention Order for five years.</p>
