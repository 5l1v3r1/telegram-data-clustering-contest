      <p>Israeli air strikes killed two Islamic Jihad militants in Gaza as rocket fire towards Israel resumed after a brief overnight lull, raising the death toll in the territory to 12 Palestinians in the heaviest round of fighting in months.</p>
      <p>The Israeli military said more than 250 rockets have been fired at communities in Israel since the violence erupted after an Israeli air strike killed a senior Islamic Jihad commander accused of being the mastermind of recent attacks.</p>
      <p>Schools remained closed in communities near the Gaza border as rockets continued to rain down, although it was less intense than a relentless barrage the previous day.</p>

      <p>But in a sign that the current round could be brief, Gaza’s Hamas rulers have yet to enter the fray.</p>
      <p>Although larger and more powerful than the Iranian-backed Islamic Jihad, Hamas is also more pragmatic. With Gaza’s economy in tatters, it appears to have little desire for another round of fighting with Israel.</p>
      <p>Egypt, which frequently mediates between Israel and Gaza militants, has been working to de-escalate tensions, according to officials in Cairo.</p>
      <p>Seeking to keep the outburst under control, the Israeli military has restricted its operations to Islamic Jihad, and nearly all the casualties so far are members of the militant group.</p>
      <p>The initial pre-dawn Israeli strike on Gaza came as another strike attributed to Israel targeted a senior Islamic Jihad commander based in Syria. The strikes appeared to be a new surge in the open warfare between Israel and Iranian proxies in the region.</p>

      <p>Iran has forces based in Syria, Israel’s northern neighbour, and supports Hezbollah militants in Lebanon. In Gaza, it supplies Islamic Jihad with cash, weapons and expertise.</p>
      <p>Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu claims Iran is using Iraq and far-off Yemen – where Tehran supports Shiite Houthi rebels at war with a Saudi-led coalition backing the government – to plan attacks against Israel. Hamas also receives some support from Iran.</p>
      <p>Israel frequently strikes Iranian interests in Syria but Tuesday’s attack in Damascus appeared to be a rare assassination attempt of a Palestinian militant in the Syrian capital.</p>
