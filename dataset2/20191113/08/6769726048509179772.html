      <p>THE City of Stirling is turning to an app to try to make paid parking easier for drivers.</p>
      <p>It plans to introduce EasyPark this year, which will allow people to pay parking fees via a mobile phone app.</p>
      <p>According to the City, the service will be available on all mobile phone types and once an account is set up, parking fees will be billed directly to driversâ€™ credit or debit card.</p>
      <p>Drivers enter a code for their parking area and choose a length of stay, which can be extended or ended as needed, and they can also opt to receive a reminder when they parking is due to expire.</p>
      <p>Stirling follows the cities of Vincent, Melville, Swan, Subiaco and South Perth and the towns of Cambridge and Victoria Park in rolling out the service.</p>
      <p>All other payment methods will still be available via its ticket machines.</p>
