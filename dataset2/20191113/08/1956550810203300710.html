      <p>One of the best things about Dubai is the super weather we have in winter. And what better way to make the most of it than by watching a movie outside? From beach <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/films">cinemas</a> to family movie nights and cinemas with retractable roofs, <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/film-tv/400044-dubais-best-movie-snacks-2019">it’s time to grab the popcorn</a>, check the film calendar and head to one of these outdoor <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/film-tv/400033-dubais-best-cinema-experiences-2019">cinemas</a> in Dubai.<br/><br/><b>Cinema on the Sand</b><br/>Looking for a unique <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/films">cinema</a> experience to try in Dubai? How about lazing on the beach, drink in hand, stars on the big screen and in the sky ahead? <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/bars/zero-gravity">Zero Gravity</a> lays on <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/bars-nightlife/418891-dubais-zero-gravity-to-screen-a-star-is-born">Cinema on the Sand</a> throughout the winter (days vary so make sure to check in advance) with films including Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl and A Star is Born playing already this season. It’s Dhs50 a ticket but the full amount is redeemable on food and drinks, so it’s basically free (kind of, ahem). No reservations are required but the film starts at 8pm so grab yourself a beanbag, sun lounger or “director’s chair” on the sand. This weekend’s screening is <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/film-tv/422670-watch-the-bodyguard-on-the-beach-in-dubai">The Bodyguard</a>, don’t miss it.<br/><i>Dhs50. Dates and times vary. Skydive Dubai Drop Zone, Dubai Marina (04 399 0009).</i><br/><br/><b>JLT Cinema Under The Stars</b><br/>If you’re looking to kick-back outdoors on a Friday night, try this free cinema experience in <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/area-guides/jumeirah-lakes-towers">JLT</a>. Every week at 6.50pm you’ll catch a movie with everything from blockbusters to foreign films and animations. This weekend (Friday November 15) The Big Trip – an animation by the write or Madagascar – is being shown. The best news? It’s free so bring your picnic blankets and snacks and chill out.<br/><i>Free. Fri, 6.50pm. <a href="http://www.dmcc.ae/">www.dmcc.ae</a>.</i><br/><br/><b>Movie Night at West 14th</b><br/>For a family-friendly movie night check out West 14th on the Palm every Thursday. From 6.30pm there’s a kids’ film, while family movies kick off at 9.30pm. Snuggle down into a beanbag plus a platter from the barbecue, and enjoy the movie. What better way to start the weekend with the fam?<br/><i>Prices vary Thu, from 6.30pm. DUKES The Palm, Palm Jumeirah (04 455 1101).</i><br/><br/><b>OUTDOOR</b><br/>‘What do we call our outdoor cinema?’ ‘How about “<a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/film-tv/382998-vox-cinemas-launches-first-licensed-outdoor-cinema">Outdoor</a>”?’ ‘That’s not very imaginative.’ ‘Well, how about we capitalise each letter?’ ‘Perfect.’ We jest, of course, because <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/film-tv/382998-vox-cinemas-launches-first-licensed-outdoor-cinema">VOX’s al fresco cinema</a> offerings are a big favourite of ours. Especially when you can watch the latest blockbusters on a bean bag while enjoying waiter service, which at the Aloft version includes a fully licensed bar. Just make sure you’re not distracted from the stars on the screen by those twinkling in the sky.<br/><i>From Dhs75 (packages available). VOX Cinemas at Aloft City Centre Deira and Galleria Mall, Dubai (600 599 905).</i><br/><br/><b>Urban Outdoor Cinema</b><br/>As if stretching out on the Beach Lawn at Dubai’s Habtoor Grand Resort wasn’t a wonderful way to pass the time already, you can also do so while watching a cult classic or modern Hollywood hit. Running three times a week, the line-up includes the sing-along specials Grease and Mamma Mia! alongside comedies such as Big, Clueless and Four Weddings And A Funeral. Our top picks of the season have to be The Shawshank Redemption (Nov 25) and The Big Short (Dec 2), although watching Wayne’s World always means party time (excellent).<br/><i>Dhs75. Sat-Mon 7.30pm. Habtoor Grand Resort, Dubai (04 399 5000).</i><br/><br/><b>Sea-nema</b><br/>For another beach cinema experience check out the newly-launched <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/film-tv/422231-dubais-azure-beach-launches-outdoor-cinem">Sea-nema</a> nights at <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/bars/azure-beach">Azure Beach</a>. There’s a special menu of snacks including pizzas, hot dogs, loaded fries and popcorn – because it’s not really a trip to the cinema without popcorn, right? The sea-nema nights will take place every Wednesday at 9.30pm with tickets coming in at Dhs50. Catch blockbuster hits like <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/films/details/4224-the-fate-of-the-furious">The Fate of the Furious</a> and Suicide Squad this November, while the December line-up will feature Logan, <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/film-tv/details/403616-avengers-endgame">Avengers: Endgame</a>, A Star Is Born and a special screening of The Grinch for <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/christmas">Christmas</a>.<br/><i>Dhs50. Wed 9.30pm. Ongoing. Rixos Premium Dubai, The Walk, JBR (052 777 9472).</i><br/><br/>Looking for all the latest <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/films">film</a> news? Click here.
