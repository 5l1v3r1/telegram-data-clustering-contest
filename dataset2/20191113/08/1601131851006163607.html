      <h1>Galaxy Fit update adds music control widget, new watch faces</h1>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/tag/galaxy-fit/">Galaxy Fit</a> may not have any built-in storage like Samsung’s smartwatches, but that doesn’t mean it shouldn’t allow you to control music running on a connected phone. It’s basic functionality that was missing from the fitness band upon launch, and the company is fixing that now with a new software update for the device.</p>
      <p>The update — firmware version <b>R370XXU0ASK1</b> — also adds new watch faces to the Galaxy Fit. The new watch faces are reportedly focused on providing useful information on-screen, such as heart rate, steps taken, and the weather. The update can be downloaded from the Galaxy Wearable app on your connected phone after you have updated the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samsung.android.modenplugin">Galaxy Fit Plugin app from the Google Play Store</a> on the latter. It remains to be seen if a similar update will be released for the Galaxy Fit e.</p>
      <p>The Galaxy Fit is an excellent fitness band for tracking basic activities, as we had concluded in <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/samsung/galaxy-fit/review">our review</a>. With minor updates like this, Samsung is only making the experience better, although you’d want to get one of the company’s smartwatches if you want more advanced fitness tracking and software features. The Galaxy Watch Active 2 is fantastic and <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/samsung/galaxy-watch-active-2/review/">Samsung’s best smartwatch yet</a>, but you can also opt for <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/2018/09/10/samsung-galaxy-watch-review">last year’s Galaxy Watch</a> if you prefer the design of traditional timepieces.</p>
