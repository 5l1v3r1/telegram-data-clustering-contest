      <p>Legendary singer Lata Mangeshkar, who was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of a hospital in Mumbai on Monday, is stable condition now. The celebrated musician was hospitalised after she complained of breathing difficulty. While earlier hospital sources had stated that she was in a "critical condition", the latest updated from the family stated that <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Lata-Mangeshkar">Lata Mangeshkar</a>'s condition had improved,“Lata di is stable and much better. Thank you very much for your prayers. We are awaiting her to be at her best so she can be home soon.

      <p>An earlier statement released by the family gave an update about the 90-year-old singer’s health condition, “Her parameters are good. Honestly speaking, she has fought so well that she is coming out of this setback. Being a singer, her lung capacity has pulled her through. Truly a fighter. We will update everyone when Lataji gets discharged and comes home. (We) request that we give family the space they deserve at the moment.”</p>
