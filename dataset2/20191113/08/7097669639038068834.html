      <h1>Trump's 1st investigation of the FBI's Russia probe is in the final review stage</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T08:46:37+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 08:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://theweek.com/" target="_blank">Peter Weber</a></address>
      <p>Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz appears to be nearing the release of his findings on the origins of the FBI's Russia investigation. Horowitz told Congress last month that his final report was being reviewed, he did not anticipate a lengthy review process, and he expects to release his report with minimal redactions.</p>
      <p>In recent days, Horowitz has invited some of the dozens of witnesses his team interviewed and their lawyers to review their testimony over the next two weeks, <a href="https://apnews.com/1132509ac4c747ababd7a50c86b09364"><i>The Associated Press</i></a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/justice-dept-inspector-general-invites-witnesses-to-review-draft-of-russia-report-signaling-public-release-is-close/2019/11/12/0a2c246c-05a2-11ea-b17d-8b867891d39d_story.html"><i>The Washington Post</i> report</a>. The witnesses will be able to suggest revisions to the portions of the report that concern their testimony. Horowitz provided a draft of his report to Attorney General William Barr in September, and Barr and other Justice Department officials have been working to clear legal and classification hurdles to the report's release.</p>
      <p>Horowitz's review covers the early stages of what later became Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election and any role the Trump campaign played. It is one of three investigations of the Russia probe that Trump's Justice Department launched. Barr has been <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/868887/attorney-general-barr-reportedly-travels-abroad-assist-another-iffy-trumpinstigated-investigation">very actively involved</a> in the investigation he assigned to U.S. Attorney John Durham, who is now <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/874294/justice-departments-review-russia-probe-now-reportedly-criminal-investigation">reportedly considering</a> unknown criminal charges.</p>
      <p>Trump and his allies are hoping that the investigations will cast doubt on the legitimacy of the origins of the Russia investigations, which, under Mueller, led to criminal convictions of Trump's former campaign chairman and vice chairman, national security adviser, and other campaign aides. If Horowitz's investigation does not come out next week, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/justice-dept-inspector-general-invites-witnesses-to-review-draft-of-russia-report-signaling-public-release-is-close/2019/11/12/0a2c246c-05a2-11ea-b17d-8b867891d39d_story.html">tweeted</a> Tuesday, "I will be very disappointed &amp; left to wonder WHAT THE GAME IS?? Is someone at FBI or DOJ tying IGs hands??"</p>
