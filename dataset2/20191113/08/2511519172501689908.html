      <h2>Source close to the politician has denied the actor’s claims</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/vice"><i>Vice</i></a> star <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ChristianBale">Christian Bale</a> has claimed <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/DickCheney">Dick Cheney</a> called him a “d***” following his unfavourable portrayal of the former Vice President in the film.</p>
      <p>Bale played the politician in the 2018 movie and won a Golden Globe for his portrayal of Cheney. </p>
      <p>The actor, who has been outspoken about his disapproval of Cheney in the past, has now said the former VP sent a second-hand message to him expressing his dislike for the film.</p>
      <p>“Strangely enough, it was through my son’s school,” Bale told <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8099906/type/dlg/https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/christian-bale-dick-cheney-vice-reaction-message-220039507.html"><i>Yahoo! Entertainment</i></a>. </p>
      <p>“One of the mums was at a party that [Cheney] was at, and she said, ‘Oh, I’m going to be seeing Christian tomorrow – you have anything to say to him?’ And he said, ‘Tell him he’s a d***'.</p>
      <p>“I went, ‘Oh, at least he’s got a sense of humour.’ And she said, ‘No, there was no humour to it whatsoever.'” </p>
      <p>A “source close to” Cheney has since denied he made the comments in a statement to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/christian-bale-dick-cheney-insulting-message-vice-portrayal"><i>Fox News</i></a>. </p>
      <p>"Dick Cheney never has and never would send a message to Bale. Totally untrue," the source reportedly said.</p>
      <p>This is not the first time the actor and politician have been at odds with each other.  Bale’s <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/golden-globes-2019-christian-bale-satan-acceptance-speech-dick-cheney-vice-a8714796.html">Golden Globes acceptance speech</a> included the following dedication to Cheney: “Thank you to Satan for giving me inspiration on how to play this role.”</p>
      <p>Bale also called Cheney a “charisma-free a***hole”. </p>
      <p>In <i>Vice</i>, Cheney was portrayed as a manipulative war hawk who secretly ran the White House during the George Bush’s time in office.</p>
