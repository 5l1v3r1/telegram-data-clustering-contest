      <p>Microsoft is starting to test its new Chromium-based Edge browser on Arm as of today, November 13. The company also is working on making the Windows-on-Arm platform more viable by bringing support for X64 apps running in emulation according to a new report. <br/><br/>Microsoft officials announced via Twitter that <a href="https://twitter.com/MSEdgeDev/status/1194694031416033280?s=20">the new Edge browser, built to run natively on ARM64, has entered the Canary testing ring</a>, and "soon" will come to the Dev and Beta channels. Even though Microsoft began shipping its Arm-based Surface Pro X devices last week, they are not shipping with a native version of the new Chromium Edge browser at this point. <br/><br/>Microsoft officials said last week that <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsofts-chromium-based-edge-browser-to-be-generally-available-january-15-2020/">Chromium-based Edge will be generally available as of January 15, 2020</a>. But until today, there was no word from the company when the native ARM version of the new browser would be going out to testers. <br/><br/>In other Windows-on-ARM news, Neowin.net reported on November 13 that <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/exclusive-microsoft-is-working-to-bring-64-bit-intel-app-emulation-to-windows-on-arm">Microsoft is working to enable X64 app emulation on the platform</a>. Right now, 32-bit (x86) Intel apps can run in emulation on Windows 10 on ARM, but x64 apps cannot run at all. A number of well-known apps like Adobe Photoshop Elements, as well as many games, are only available as x64 apps, which meant unless/until their developers recompile them to run on Windows 10 on Arm natively, they cannot work at all on PCs with Arm processors. <br/><br/>A year ago, Microsoft officials said <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-on-arm-s-versus-pro-emulation-and-64-bit-app-support/">emulating x64 in addition to x86 would double the engineering work required</a> and provide questionable performance gains. In addition, the Windows on Windows (WoW) abstraction layer which enables 32-bit x86 apps to run on ARM only supports 32-bit applications, not 64-bit.<br/><br/>Neowin says the <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/exclusive-microsoft-is-working-to-bring-64-bit-intel-app-emulation-to-windows-on-arm">x64 app emulation on Windows on Arm may not show up until Windows 10 21H1</a>, however.</p>
