      <p>TORONTO - Teachers in Ontario's English Catholic system have voted 97 per cent in favour of a strike.</p>
      <p>Ontario English Catholic Teachers' Association president Liz Stuart says the vote sends a message to the government that members won't accept an agreement that would be detrimental to learning and working conditions in schools.</p>
      <p>The Catholic teachers are not yet in a legal strike position, and negotiations will continue.</p>
      <p>OECTA is now the third of four major teachers' unions whose members are heading toward potential strike action.</p>
      <p>High school teachers are in a legal strike position as of Monday, though they won't be off the job that day as they have not yet filed a required five-day notice.</p>
      <p>Elementary teachers also voted for job action and will be in a legal strike position as of Nov. 25.</p>
