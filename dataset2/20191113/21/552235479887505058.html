      <h1>Alfredo Morelos to Leicester and the truth about Rangers star's transfer speculation</h1>
      <h2>A report down south suggests Brendan Rodgers' side are planning a move for the Ibrox talisman in January.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T21:06:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 21:06</time> by <a rel="author">Keith Jackson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/keith-jackson/</a></address>
      <p>Leicester City are not preparing a bid for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alfredo-morelos">Alfredo Morelos</a> in January.</p>
      <p>A report down south, which has been picked up by Scottish media outlets, suggests Brendan Rodgers' side are planning a move for the in-form <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> striker in the New Year.</p>
      <p>But <i><b>Record Sport</b> </i>understand that the Foxes are not interested in signing the Colombian forward.</p>
      <p>The Premier League side have also dismissed recent links with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> star <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kristoffer-ajer">Kristoffer Ajer</a> .</p>
      <p>Ibrox sporting director Ross Wilson insisted he is "100 per cent sure" Morelos will be going nowhere when the transfer window opens at the end of next month.</p>

      <p>He said: "We want our best players to stay here as long as they possibly can.</p>
      <p>"We understand that like every other club in world football that there comes a point when players have to move on to something else for a variety of reasons."</p>
      <p>There was talk Leicester were targeting a January move for Ajer last month after being previously linked with the Hoops centre-half in the summer.</p>
      <p>But <i><b>Record Sport</b> </i>understand there is no substance to this claim.</p>
      <p>One player Leicester were keen on acquiring was Callum McGregor as Rodgers tried to reunite with the midfielder in the summer.</p>
      <p>Rodgers was instrumental in McGregor's success during his time at Parkhead but Celtic insisted their star player was not for sale.</p>
      <p>The Scotland international has since penned a new five-year deal at the club.</p>
