      <p>A dog owner has been fined after his pet bit a man at a Northumberland coastal beauty spot.</p>
      <p>Keith Docker had been walking his partner's two Rottweilers at Newton-by-the-Sea, in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/northumberland">Northumberland</a> , when one of them attacked a fellow walker.</p>
      <p>The animal, called Winnie, bit the victim on his thigh but, when Docker was told what had happened, he kept walking and said "Don't be daft, don't be silly", a court heard.</p>
      <p>The police were called and it was found the man had two puncture wounds on his leg.</p>
      <p>Docker, of Dunstan Hill, Dunstan, near <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/alnwick">Alnwick</a> , was later interviewed by officers and admitted his dog had bitten the victim.</p>
      <p>The 65-year-old has now been fined £500 and ordered to pay £50 compensation after he admitted having a dog dangerously our of control and causing injury.</p>

      <p>Prosecutor, Ami Dodd, told <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/courts">South East Northumberland Magistrates' Court</a> that the victim had been on holiday in the area with his family and was walking his Border Collie dog at Newton Steads car park, near the beach at Newton-by-the-Sea, at around 2.30pm on July 25 this year.</p>
      <p>He saw Docker coming towards him with two Rottweilers, one of which was on a lead and another walking free.</p>
      <p>Miss Dodd said: "The dog off the lead lunged towards him and bit him on the left thigh.</p>
      <p>"He immediately said to the defendant 'Your dog has just bitten me' and pointed to the bite mark on his thigh.</p>
      <p>"The defendant kept walking and said 'Don't be daft' and 'Don't be silly'. The injured party said he was going to inform the police but the defendant ignored him and carried on walking towards the beach."</p>
      <p>In a statement, the victim said: "I was shocked but more shocked by the manner and attitude of Mr Docker denying what had happened and walking away without offering an apology.</p>
      <p>"I was also worried that there were young children around and they could have become victims."</p>
      <p>The court was told that Winnie had never bitten or shown any aggression towards anyone before.</p>
      <p>Graham Crouth, defending, added: "The dog on the lead and the injured party's collie were snapping at each other. The defendant was concentrating on that dog when he was suddenly told 'Your dog has bitten me'.</p>
      <p>"He thought the injured party was talking about the dog on the lead and Mr Docker was adamant he hadn't seen that dog bite him.</p>
      <p>"When he responded 'Don't be silly', he was referring to the dog on the lead."</p>
      <p>As well as fining Docker, District Judge Begley also ordered that Winnie be muzzled and kept on a lead in public.</p>
