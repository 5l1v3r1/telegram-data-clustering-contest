      <p>The <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/hou/houston-texans">Houston Texans</a> have claimed former <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/tb/tampa-bay-buccaneers">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a> cornerback <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3054955/vernon-hargreaves">Vernon Hargreaves</a> off waivers Wednesday, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter.</p>
      <p>Hargreaves was released by the Bucs on Tuesday after he was benched last weekend for what coach Bruce Arians deemed a lack of hustle.</p>
      <p>Hargreaves, the 11th overall pick in the 2016 draft, was the Bucs' top cornerback heading into this season.</p>
      <p>"He didn't look like he was hustling to go in for a tackle," Arians said when asked about Hargreaves, who surrendered a 55-yard catch to <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3914328/andy-isabella">Andy Isabella</a> at the beginning of the third quarter against the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ari/arizona-cardinals">Arizona Cardinals</a> on Sunday. "He was chasing somebody across the field, and he wasn't running fast enough."</p>
      <p>Although he posted an interception in Week 1 and made a winning tackle of <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3117251/christian-mccaffrey">Christian McCaffrey</a> in Week 2, Hargreaves, who was expected to be a leader, has appeared to lack focus at times this year.</p>
