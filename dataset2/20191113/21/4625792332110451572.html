      <p>Texas Republican Rep. John Ratcliffe attempted to question House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff at the first public impeachment hearing about when his staff first had contact with the Ukranian whistleblower.</p>
      <p>Ratcliffe and House Republican colleagues want to tease out that point to undermine Democrats' case against President Trump. They say it points to a partisan conspiracy by government bureaucrats to oust Trump from office.</p>
      <p>While questioning Acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor on Wednesday, Ratcliffe confirmed with Taylor whether he thought no pressure, no demand, no conditions, no blackmail, no corruption, or a quid pro quo existed on the July 25 call between President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine and Trump.</p>
      <p>“Do you have an explanation for why within days of that phone call when no quid pro quo was even possible? A person who later became a whistleblower walked into Chairman Schiff's staff to discuss what Chairman Schiff's spokesman Patrick Boland said were the, quote, outlines of the whistleblower's accusations?” Ratcliffe asked.</p>
      <p>At this point, Ratcliffe looked over at Schiff and went on to ask the California Democrat if he was interested in engaging in a colloquy. The chairman pointedly declined.</p>
      <p>“My colleague will address his questions to the witnesses,” Schiff responded.</p>
      <p>“I'll take that as a no. You're not interested in a colloquy,” Ratcliffe said.</p>
      <p>Schiff replied, “Mr. Ratcliffe, you could take it anyway you like it, but appropriately, your question should be directed to the witnesses.”</p>
