      <p><a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484336/All-Your-Last-Minute-Disney-Questions-Answered">Disney+</a> just <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484470/disney-features-a-warning-on-some-of-its-older-content-with-outdated-cultural-depictions">launched yesterday</a>, but it doesn't have <i>every</i> big Disney, Marvel, or Star Wars movie available for streaming right away. So when will the streamer get big movies like <i>Black Panther</i>, <i>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</i>, <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i>, <i>Solo</i>, <i>Incredibles 2</i>, <i>Coco</i>, etc.? The answers are below!</p>
      <blockquote><b>MCU Movies</b><br/>• <i>Thor: Ragnarok</i> - Thursday, December 5, 2019<br/>• <i>Black Panther</i> - March 4, 2020<br/>• <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> - June 25, 2020<br/>• <i>Ant-Man and the Wasp</i> - July 29, 2020<br/><b>Star Wars Movies</b><br/>• <i>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</i> - December 26, 2019<br/>• <i>Solo: A Star Wars Story</i> - July 9, 2020<br/><b>Pixar Movies</b><br/>• <i>Coco</i> - November 29, 2019<br/>• <i>Incredibles 2</i> - July 30, 2020<br/><b>Disney Movies</b><br/>• <i>Bedtime Stories</i> - March 5, 2020<br/>• <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i> - March 25, 2020<br/>• <i>The Pirate Fairy</i> - June 15, 2020<br/>• <i>Tarzan</i> - June 23, 2020<br/>• <i>Tarzan II</i> - June 23, 2020<br/>• <i>Christopher Robin</i> - September 5, 2020<br/>• <i>The Nutcracker and the Four Realms</i> - November 28 - 2020<br/>• <i>Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales</i> - December 2, 2020<br/>• <i>Ralph Breaks the Internet</i> - December 11, 2020<br/>• <i>Mary Poppins Returns</i> - January 9, 2021<br/>• <i>Tinker Bell and the Legend of the NeverBeast</i> - May 17, 2021</blockquote>
      <p>Disney+ has all of those movies (and more) listed with notes reading "Due to existing agreements this title will be available on [such-and-such date]." It probably won't surprise you to hear almost all of the titles above are currently on Netflix, and that's clearly the "existing agreement" preventing the movies from coming to Disney+ sooner.</p>
      <p>(<i>Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales</i> is the only one not <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482925/netflix-new-releases-movies-and-tv-shows-streaming-in-november-2019">currently on Netflix</a> right now.)</p>
      <p>It's a shame that Disney+ can't have <i>Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi</i> until December 26, 2019, since <i>Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker</i> arrives in theaters on December 20. I'm sure <i>Star Wars</i> fans would love to stream the entire Skywalker Saga -- which has its own <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/franchise/star-wars-la-saga-skywalker">cool collection page on Disney+</a> -- before seeing <i>The Rise of Skywalker</i>, but they'll have to wait on <i>The Last Jedi</i>. (They'll also have to re-debate the Han/Greedo scene in <i>A New Hope</i>, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484511/disneys-version-of-a-new-hope-changes-the-han-solo-and-greedo-scene-in-a-weird-way">which was changed again</a>.)</p>
      <p>It's also a shame Disney+ won't have <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> for another seven months, since it did make <i>Avengers: Endgame</i> <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483975/disney-just-moved-up-the-release-of-avengers-endgame-to-day-one">available on day one</a>. The four titles above are the only MCU movies <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484463/disney-will-have-more-marvel-movies-available-on-day-one-than-we-thought">not yet on Disney+</a> -- except <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484652/bummer-tom-hollands-spider-man-movies-arent-heading-to-disney">Tom Holland's two Spider-Man movies to date</a>, since they are also Sony movies. Don't expect the Spider-Man movies to show up on Disney+ anytime soon.</p>
      <p>Disney+ does already have a ton of options available, though, including some <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2484527/disney-has-some-classic-tv-shows-we-werent-expecting">classic TV shows we weren't expecting</a>.</p>

      <p>Which new movie are you most interested in watching when it arrives on Disney+? Have you searched for any other movies not yet available on the streamer?</p>
