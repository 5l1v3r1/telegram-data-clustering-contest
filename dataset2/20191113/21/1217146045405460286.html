      <p>A new and strange ransomware called AnteFrigus is now being distributed through malvertising that redirects users to the the RIG exploit kit. Unlike other ransomware, AnteFrigus does not target the C: drive, but only other drives commonly associated with removable devices and mapped network drives.</p>
      <p>The RIG exploit kit uses malicious scripts hosted on attacker-owned or compromised sites that exploit vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer. If these vulnerabilities can be exploited, it will then install a payload in the visitor's machine without their knowledge.</p>
      <p>In a new Hookads malvertising campaign discovered by exploit kit expert <a href="https://twitter.com/tkanalyst">Mol69</a>, the RIG exploit is now installing the AnteFrigus Ransomware on unsuspecting users.</p>

      <h3>Unusual behavior of the AnteFrigus Ransomware</h3>
      <p>When ransomware is executed on a computer, it will typically enumerate all of the drive letters on a computer and any accessible network shares. It will then attempt to encrypt files on these drives and shares if they have a certain file extension or if they are not part of a blacklist.</p>
      <p>The AnteFrigus Ransomware, though, does things a bit differently.</p>
      <p>When numerous researchers, including BleepingComputer, attempted to install AnteFrigus we found that the ransomware not encrypting anything other than USB drives or mapped network drives.</p>
      <p>Due to its strange behavior, BleepingComputer contacted security researcher and reverse engineer <a href="https://twitter.com/VK_Intel">Vitali Kremez</a> and asked him to take a look.</p>
      <p>It turns out, that this ransomware only targets the D:, E:, F:, G:, H:, and I: drives. It <b>does not</b> encrypt any files located on the C: drive or unmapped network shares.</p>

        <figcaption>Targeted Drives</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Furthermore, it will not encrypt any files that contain the following strings.</p>
      <pre>dll, adv, ani, big, bat, bin, cab, cmd, com, cpl, cur, deskthemepack, diagcab, diagcfg, diagpkg, drv, exe, hlp, icl, icns, ico, ics, idx, ldf, lnk, mod, mpa, msc, msp, msstyles, msu, nls, nomedia, ocx, prf, rom, rtp, scr, shs, spl, sys, theme, themepack, wpx, lock, key, hta, msi, pck</pre>
      <p>Not encrypting the C: drive is odd as it is common for users to save documents on their local drives, especially if they are home users or have home offices.</p>
      <p>It's possible that the ransomware is only targeting these specific drive letters as they may correspond to network shares where users commonly save their data in a business environment.</p>
      <p>Kremez, though, does not think its being done for some sort of thought-out targeting methodology.</p>
      <p>Based on the ransomware's code, Kremez told BleepingComputer that it is most likely a bug as the ransomware does not look particular sophisticated to him.</p>
      <p>"This malware does not look super sophisticated and contained a plethora of debugging symbols, source references, and test/debug location," Kremez told BleepingComputer.</p>
      <p>For this reason, Kremez feels that AnteFrigus is still in development or testing mode.</p>
      <p>To distribute an in-development ransomware, though, would be foolish as the ransomware dev has to pay for RIG exploit kit installs and sacrifices potential victims to test the ransomware.</p>
      <h3>The AnteFrigus encryption process</h3>
      <p>Regardless of its reasns, the AnteFrigus ransomware will encrypt all files on the D:, E:, F:, G:, H:, and I: drives that do not contain the extensions listed in the previous section.</p>
      <p>When encrypting a file, it will append a random character extension to encrypted files as shown below.</p>

        <figcaption>AnteFrigus Encrypted Files</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The ransomware will also create the <b>C:\qweasd\test.txt</b> file, which is most likely being used as a lock or debug file.</p>
      <p>Finally the ransomware will create ransom notes named [extension]-readme.txt in the C:\Instraction folder and on the desktop.</p>

      <p>This ransom note will contain a link to the Tor payment site, currently located at http://yboa7nidpv5jdtumgfm4fmmvju3ccxlleut2xvzgn5uqlbjd5n7p3kid.onion/, which will list the current ransom amount and a bitcoin address to send the payment to.</p>
      <p>In our test, the ransom is $1,995 USD and becomes $3,990 after a little over 4 days as shown below.</p>

      <p>At this time, it is not known if the ransomware has any weakness that could lead to a free decryptor. Researchers will be analyzing the ransomware to determine that in the near future.</p>
