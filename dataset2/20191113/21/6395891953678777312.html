      <p><b>DAYTON, OhioÂ (AP)</b> - An Ohio man has been charged with lying when buying a gun authorities say was used in the slaying of a Dayton detective shot while serving a drug-related warrant.</p>
      <p>Fifty-five-year-old Det. Jorge Del Rio died Nov. 7. Three men were charged in the Nov. 4 fatal shooting.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Attorney's office said Wednesday that a Trenton, Ohio, man has been charged with lying on a federal firearms form when he bought multiple handguns including weapons recovered at the scene of Del Rio's shooting.</p>
      <p>Investigators say 50-year-old Daniel Wells made false statements on a federal form when he said he was buying the guns for himself but already had a buyer lined up.</p>
      <p>He is free pending federal grand jury action.</p>
      <p>His attorney didn't immediately respond to a message for comment.</p>
