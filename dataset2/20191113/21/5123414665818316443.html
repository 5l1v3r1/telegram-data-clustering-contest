      <p>Over the past 10 years or so, Hospital Records has become not only one of the biggest in Drum &amp; Bass but in electronic music as a whole. The label has expanded from a record label to an event company and even a publishing house that regularly sees its artists being featured in video games and more. One of the label's mainstays, Danny Byrd, has been there since the beginning, and together they have released some of the genre's most seminal albums. Earlier this year, I had the chance to meet Danny while we were both playing at EDC in Las Vegas, and after chatting about gear and music, sat down for a proper chat on In Conversation. In this episode, we speak about working with topliners, hardware vs software, and interesting ways of maintaining focus in a world full of distractions.  </p>
