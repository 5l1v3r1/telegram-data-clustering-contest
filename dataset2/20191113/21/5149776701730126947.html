      <h1>Leeds United star makes interesting claim about Nottingham Forest's City Ground</h1>
      <h2>Latest Nottingham Forest news | The Reds faced Leeds in the Sky Bet Championship at Elland Road in August, where they were held to a 1-1 draw</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T21:20:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 21:20</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Wakefield</a></address>
      <p>Leeds United captain Liam Cooper says the City Ground is one of his favourite away stadiums to visit in the Sky Bet Championship.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> are yet to welcome the Whites to Trentside this season, but have already made the trip to Elland Road.</p>
      <p>A late goal from Lewis Grabban saw the Reds secure a 1-1 draw with Marcelo Bielsa’s side in August.</p>
      <p>The last time Forest faced Leeds at the City Ground was last season on New Year’s Day, when the Reds claimed a 4-2 win.</p>
      <p>A brace from Jack Colback supported by goals from Daryl Murphy and Ben Osborn sealed with victory, as Leeds midfielder was sent off shortly before half time.</p>
      <p>Cooper was recently speaking alongside Mateusz Klich and Ben White at a Q&amp;A event at Elland Road, where he was asked for his favourite and least favourite away stadium in the Championship.</p>
      <p>"Favourite (away ground) would probably be – I like the Forest ground", said Cooper.</p>

      <p>He added: "Atmosphere is always good (and) we always get a good allocation.</p>
      <p>"But if, obviously, Aston Villa are still in the league I'd say that. Villa Park is brilliant. <br/><br/>"The worst (away stadium) – Brentford. Hate the place. <br/><br/>"The changing rooms are tiny and, let's put it this way, nobody fits on the toilet."</p>
