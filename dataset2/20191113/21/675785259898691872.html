      <h1>Ex-Arsenal ace Mathieu Flamini insists sports stars must speak up on environmental issues</h1>
      <h2>The former Arsenal and Crystal Palace midfielder has set up his own biochemical company off the pitch and has urged fellow footballers to use their profiles to help</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T21:02:49+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 21:02</time> by <a rel="author">Neil McLeman, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/neil-mcleman/</a></address>
      <p>Former Arsenal star Mathieu Flamini has claimed top sports stars have a “social responsibility” to speak up on environmental issues because the planet is in grave danger.</p>
      <p>And the Frenchman believes popular athletes can fill the “trust” void left by politicians and big business.</p>
      <p>The eco-entrepreneur co-owns the GF Biochemicals company and has set up a range of 100% natural beauty products with his ex-Gunners team-mate Mesut Ozil.</p>
      <p>But Flamini, now 35, also uses his profile and social media following to speak up about the future of the planet by backing groups such as Extinction Rebellion and Surfers Against Sewage.</p>

      <p>And he joined a Young Global Leaders visit to Greenland last year to see up close the chilling effects of climate change</p>
      <p>“It was emotional because it is such a beautiful place but what is even more emotion is the impact that climate change is having on this part of the world and globally,” Flamini said.</p>
      <p>“It is incredible. Just to give you one fact. If the water level raises 1m it will displace half a billion people. Even if you don't really care about climate change, unfortunately you are going to be impacted because that is going to have a massive impact on the world.</p>
      <p>“It is very alarming – I have seen it with my own eyes. All the glaciers melting year after year. And I really, really don't understand that when we have all these scientists around the globe showing the facts, how can we still question that it is happening.”</p>
      <p>Flamini, who also played for Milan, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> and Getafe and has not yet retired, has over half a million followers on social media.</p>

      <p>“If you look at athletes, and particularly football players, most of the people following us are between the age of 16-30 so we are talking about the next generation on a global scale,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We have a social responsibility. And when I say that, you can influence people in a good or bad way. That is why I wanted to use my platform to influence people following me to create awareness around climate change and give them additional information to what they have been hearing all these years. That is why I strongly believe an athlete has a massive role to play.</p>
      <p>“And these days we have a massive problem of trust between people and government. Between people and big corporations. So everyone is looking for trust and what I can say is that athletes are still able to help people to dream. That is why I believe athletes have a real role and can play a leading role in trying to increase awareness but by also putting pressure on corporations and governments to drive change.”</p>

      <p>Flamini has helped found Italy’s first masters in bio-economy and sits on the Environmental Committee of 2024 Paris Olympics in Paris.</p>
      <p>“I have always been a fighter on the pitch,” said the midfielder. “What I find also exciting is the opportunity to have a real purpose and mission for the rest of my life and to fight outside the pitch.”</p>
