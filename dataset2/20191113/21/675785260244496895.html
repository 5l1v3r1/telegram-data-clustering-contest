      <h1>Strictly's Kelvin Fletcher on why dancing at Blackpool means so much to him</h1>
      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Kelvin opened up about his childhood and the emotional significance of Blackpool ahead of Saturday's live show in the Blackpool Tower Ballroom</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T21:00:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 21:00</time> by <a rel="author">Katie Begley</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">STRICTLY’S</a> Kelvin Fletcher will be an emotional wreck when he takes to the floor at Blackpool’s iconic Tower Ballroom on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>The actor, who already battles with nerves before every show, says Blackpool will be especially poignant for him as it is a reminder of his childhood - and how far he has come.</p>
      <p>The 35-year-old former Emmerdale actor says: “It’s made the hairs go up on my neck just thinking about it.”</p>
      <p>For many of the stars in the BBC’s flagship show, reaching Blackpool’s lives show is the last major milestone before all eyes turn to the final.</p>
      <p>But for the Oldham-born actor it will remind him of a time when his family could not afford to go abroad.</p>
      <p>“Before the dawn of budget airlines, you couldn’t think of going to Spain, it was just too expensive,” he explains. “We would go to Blackpool for our holidays.</p>

      <p>“So the Blackpool Tower, Winter Gardens, that’s all very much part of my childhood. I just remember it as an amazing resort, absolutely buzzing.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been to the ballroom on a Friday afternoon, there might have been a few couples getting up and doing a little dance, you’d sit there, have your cup of tea, and random people would just get up. I just remember thinking how stunning it was inside.</p>
      <p>“I think it will be really weird to walk out there in a completely different stage of my life, as an adult. It feels really special for me because Blackpool was a huge part of my childhood.” Kelvin’s had a roller coaster of a ride on the show so far.</p>
      <p>Drafted in with just two weeks notice the actor and racing driver had to replace Made In Chelsea’s Jamie Laing after he was ruled out through injury.</p>

      <p>Kelvin’s debut dance with professional Oti Mabuse, 29, earned him an incredible 32 points from the judges and made him the bookies favourite to take home the glitterball trophy.</p>
      <p>But while his racy routines have set the dance floor alight, behind the scenes Kelvin’s been fighting a weekly crisis of confidence. He says: “You’ve danced on Saturday, you’ve got through on Sunday, you’re feeling great on Monday morning and then you’re back to square one.</p>
      <p>“You can’t dance, you’re doing this wrong step or that wrong step, it’s like, ‘S**t!’. Your confidence is kind of all over the place. I feel completely crushed.”</p>

      <p>Before each performance, Kelvin calls on his acting skills to cover up his last-minute nerves.</p>
      <p>He adds: “I really feel like I’m utilising my skills as an actor because I feel completely sick. I even manage to fool my mum. I always call her as soon as I come off and she’s like, ‘You were brilliant, you looked great!’ and I’m like, ‘Mum, I felt like crying for five minutes before, I was so nervous.”</p>
      <p>Dare Kelvin dream of what happens if they make it through Saturday and head for the final?</p>
      <p>“You have to take it week by week. There have been a few shocks lately, so you just have to give the best you can and hope you make it through.”</p>
