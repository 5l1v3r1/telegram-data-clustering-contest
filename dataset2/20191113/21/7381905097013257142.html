      <p>Tehran Times – AMMAN, <b>Iran national football team head coach Marc Wilmots says that they are focused on putting on a good display against Iraq at the 2022 FIFA World Cup.</b></p>
      <p>Team Melli will meet their archrivals on Matchday 5 of Asia’s second round of qualifying on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Group C leaders Iraq entertain Iran in neutral Amman as the two sides resume what is one of Asia’s most well-known rivalries, one which dates back all the way to 1962.</p>
      <p>“The venue has been changed but I think it doesn’t have much effect on the result. This is our third away matches out of four and we are focused on putting on a good performance against Iraq. Our primary focus is on our style of play,” the Belgian coach said.</p>
      <p>“We know the importance of the result, but we should not feel the pressure. We are focused on booking a place at the 2022 World Cup for the third time in a row,” Wilmots concluded.</p>
      <p>Iraq coach Srecko Katanec is not happy with facing Iran in Amman but says they have to accept the situation.</p>
      <p>Iraq had been due to play in Basra but the southern port city has been caught up in the anti-government demonstrations and FIFA requested an alternative venue because of ongoing protests.</p>
      <p>“Our first goal is to win the match. Iran are one of the most powerful teams in Asia but we know them well. I preferred to meet Iran in our venue in Basra in front of our fans but the situation changed,” the Slovenian coach said.</p>
