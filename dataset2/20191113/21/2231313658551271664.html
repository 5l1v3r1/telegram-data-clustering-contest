      <h2>Disney+ has already garnered millions of subscribers, the company announced today.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T21:22:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 21:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fool.com/author/2104/" target="_blank">Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks)</a></address>
      <h3>What happened</h3>
      <p>Shares of media giant <b>Walt Disney</b> (<a href="https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/walt-disney/dis/">NYSE:DIS</a>) jumped on Wednesday, closing the trading day up 7.25%.</p>
      <p>The stock's gain follows news that the company's Disney+ streaming service, launched just the day before, has already surpassed 10 million subscribers.</p>

      <h3>So what</h3>
      <p>The service is seeing "extraordinary demand," Disney said in a press release on Wednesday. It costs $6.99 per month or $69.99 per year, and includes 500 films from Disney-owned studios like Marvel, Lucasfilm, and its namesake Walt Disney brand, and 7,500 episodes of TV shows.</p>
      <p>The service is part of the company's strategy to evolve to a direct-to-consumer business model. </p>
      <p>It would be difficult to overstate what a significant achievement it is to gain 10 million subscribers in such a short period of time. Analysts, on average, were predicting Disney+ would attract 10 million to 18 million subscribers within its first year. </p>
      <h3>Now what</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.fool.com/how-to-invest/stocks.aspx">Investors</a> will want to continue to keep an eye on Disney+ subscriber figures in future quarterly updates. Pent-up demand for the service and heavy marketing by Walt Disney leading up to its launch likely played a significant role in the service's first-day success. Investors should look for more meaningful subscriber growth in the coming quarters as the service <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/11/13/disney-is-here-what-you-need-to-know.aspx">rolls out to other markets</a>.</p>
