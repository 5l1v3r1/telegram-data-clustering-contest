      <p>CAIRO (Reuters) - At least seven people were killed and 16 injured in a fire in a Nile Delta village on Wednesday evening, hours after the attempted theft of gas from a pipeline caused a gas leak in the area, Egypt’s state-run newspaper Akhbar Elyom said.</p>
      <p>One local resident told Reuters a hospital in the area was packed and that there appeared to be more casualties than reported. The smell of gas was everywhere, he said.</p>
      <p>Abdel-Moneim Hafez, head of the Petroleum Pipelines Company, said the attempt to rob the pipeline took place in Itay el-Baroud in Beheira governorate on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
      <p>“As a result of an unknown source of flame, there was a flare in the leaked product following the accident,” state news agency MENA quoted him as saying.</p>
      <p>Technical teams had rushed to the scene after the attempted theft and controlled the leakage, Hafez said.</p>
      <p>The injuries included different degrees of burns, MENA quoted Khaled Megahed, adviser to the health minister, as saying. All of the injured were in hospital, he said.</p>
