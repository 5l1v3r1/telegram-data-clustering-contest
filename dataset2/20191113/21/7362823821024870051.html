      <p>Police canvassing a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/missouri">Missouri</a> neighborhood on Wednesday made the ultimate "chilling" discovery: a freezer packed with a dead man's remains.</p>
      <p>Investigators from the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement">Joplin Police Department</a> were looking into an arson and burglary that took place on Nov. 5 when they received a tip that a deceased person was in a residence just a few doors away, a spokesman for the department told Fox News.</p>

      <p>An autopsy is being scheduled and his identification is being withheld as authorities contact the next of kin, police said, adding that the investigation is ongoing.</p>
