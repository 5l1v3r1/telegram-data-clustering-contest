      <p>CALGARY, Alberta (AP) — Joe Pavelski scored twice, including an empty-net goal, and the resurgent Dallas Stars defeated the Calgary Flames 3-1 on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>Calgary native Justin Dowling’s first NHL goal was the winner for Dallas, which is 8-1-1 after stumbling to a 1-7-1 start this season. Ben Bishop made 24 saves.</p>
      <p>Sean Monahan scored for the Flames (10-8-3), who lost in regulation for just the second time at home (6-2-2). Cam Talbot turned aside 29 shots.</p>
      <p>Dowling had only three career points coming into the game. He toe-dragged around Talbot and fired from a sharp angle just inside the far post to make it 2-0.</p>
      <p>The unassisted goal at 6:38 of the third period came just seconds after the Flames blew a chance to pull even. Mark Giordano and Mikael Backlund went back and forth with short passes on a 3-on-1 before Backlund fired wide from directly in front.</p>
      <p>Monahan’s power-play goal cut Calgary’s deficit to 2-1 at 9:57 of the third. Taking advantage of a double-minor for high-sticking on Radek Faksa, who accidentally clipped Johnny Gaudreau in the face, Monahan knocked in his fifth goal of the season from the side of the net.</p>
      <p>Advertising</p>
      <p>The Stars took the lead during a dominant second period in which they outshot Calgary 18-6 and scored the only goal.</p>
      <p>They grabbed the momentum early thanks to a goaltender interference penalty on Sam Bennett. It was on the sixth shot of that power play that Pavelski put a bouncing puck past Talbot.</p>
      <p>Both teams had eight shots on goal in a scoreless first period. Calgary had the better chances, but could not solve Bishop.</p>
      <p>The best opportunity came in the opening minute when Andrew Mangiapane appeared to have Bishop beaten. Mangiapane tried to tuck the puck behind the Stars goalie as he skated across the top of the crease, but couldn’t get it past Bishop’s outstretched pad.</p>
      <p>NOTES: Mattias Janmark (lower body) is one of six injured Stars players. Roman Polak (fractured sternum), who missed his 18th game, is closest to returning. Nick Caamano, called up Tuesday from Texas of the AHL, took Janmark’s spot. … Michael Frolik returned to Calgary’s lineup after being scratched the previous two games.</p>
