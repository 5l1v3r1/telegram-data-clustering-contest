      <p>KBS News recently released a statement saying that '<b><a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/Produce%2048">Produce 48</a></b>' and '<b><a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/Produce%20X%20101">Produce X 101</a></b>' trainees were never considered for summons since the allegations are related to the staff members.</p>
      <p>This comes after rumors of <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/article/2019/11/x1-members-to-undergo-police-questioning-for-produce-x-101-vote-manipulation-investigation">X1 members being summoned for questioning</a> and <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/X1">X1</a>'s reps denying these rumors.</p>
      <p>You can read and see a rough translation their statement below.</p>
      <p>"The police also said that "the nature of the case is undermining the fairness of the crew," and the summons investigation, which is a reference for the trainees who appeared in the program, is not being examined at all."</p>
