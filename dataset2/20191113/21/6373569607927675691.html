      <p>Plymouth Argyle are out of the Leasing.com Trophy after Bristol Rovers won the final game in Southern Group B.</p>
      <p>Graham Coughlan’s Rovers beat Swindon Town 1-0 at the Memorial Stadium on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>It is the third consecutive season that Argyle have gone out of the competition before the knockout stage.</p>
      <p>The Pilgrims finished third in the group, with Rovers ending up top of the table and Chelsea Under-21s also qualifying for the last 32 in second spot.</p>
      <p>Swindon were bottom of the table without picking up a point from their three games.</p>
      <p>The Robins were captained by former Argyle goalkeeper Luke McCormick against Rovers, while ex-Pilgrims’ midfielder Toumani Diagouraga was also in their starting line-up.</p>
      <p>The only goal of the game came in the 72nd minute and was scored by Mark Little.</p>
      <p>Argyle manager Ryan Lowe led Bury to the semi-finals of the EFL Trophy last season but could not guide the Pilgrims past the group stage this term.</p>
