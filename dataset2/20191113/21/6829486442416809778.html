      <h1>Please Enjoy This Extremely Bizarre Vance Joy Parody From Matt And Alex</h1>

      <p><a href="https://junkee.com/tag/matt-and-alex">Matt and Alex,</a> one of the most beloved radio duos in recent memory, are back in our lives for a very limited time, reuniting in order to co-host the ‘Best Video’ award at the ARIAs. So, in true Matt and Alex style, they’ve celebrated the occasion by making the world’s weirdest ‘Riptide’ tribute.</p>
      <p>Yep, while most legacy acts would spend their time back in the spotlight together doing pat interviews and making sweet, nostalgic videos, Matt and Alex have instead decided to throw their entire energies behind a minute-long clip set to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riptide_(Vance_Joy_song)">the Vance Joy megahit</a> and filled with imagery plucked straight from your most melodic night terror.</p>

      <p>So there’s shots of the pair performing budget dentistry upon one another, picking bathing costumes out of their butts, wielding giant foam hands, and generally making surrealistic nuisances of themselves.</p>
      <p>Why ‘Riptide’? Uh, well, I mean it kinda fits in with the fact that they’ll be presenting the award Best Video, presented by YouTube Music — and the Vance Joy clip has become iconic in its own way. But also, it doesn’t really fit with anything, and it’s the kind of genial lunacy that has defined the career of radio’s two loosest units.</p>
      <p>Watch the entire bizarre clip over on YouTube Music <a href="https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=ojQZQP29_Dc&amp;list=RDAMVMojQZQP29_Dc">here</a>.</p>
