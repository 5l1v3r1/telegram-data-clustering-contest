      <h1>Bitstamp Crypto Exchange Expands Into Asia-Pacific Region With New Hire</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T21:51:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 21:51</time> by <a rel="author">Joeri Cant</a></address>
      <p>Luxembourg-based cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp has hired Andrew Leelarthaepin to lead its business development efforts in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region.</p>
      <p>In a Nov. 13 press release, Bitstamp <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/11/13/1946448/0/en/Bitstamp-Expands-Presence-in-Asia-with-Key-Hire.html">announced</a> that Leelarthaepin was joining the company to further expand the exchange’s presence in Asia-Pacific “to meet the growing level of demand for the exchange’s services.” </p>
      <h3>Bitstamp’s struggle to establish a local presence in Asia</h3>
      <p>Miha Grčar, global head of business development at Bitstamp, said that the crypto exchange already has “an excellent reputation” in the West, but has so far been unable to establish a local presence in the APAC region. Grčar sees this new hire as an important step towards achieving that goal and establish themselves in the region and said:</p>
      <blockquote>“Andrew’s knowledge of the global financial markets and experience in the region makes him a great fit to oversee Bitstamp’s expansion in this very important market.”</blockquote>
      <p>Leelarthaepin previously worked at major financial institutions such as JPMorgan Chase, CGS-CIMB Securities and Saxo Bank, for which he ran distribution businesses across the Asia-Pacific region. Leelarthaepin commented on his new position: </p>
      <blockquote>“Cryptocurrency adoption in Asia is growing at a breakneck pace and the commodities and assets trading markets in general are very highly developed. I believe there is a large need for Bitstamp’s mature approach to crypto in this region and look forward to expanding our presence here.”</blockquote>
      <h3>Bitstamp highlights Bitcoin’s utility</h3>
      <p>In October, the CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp, Nejc Kodrics, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-network-transfers-1-billion-for-price-of-a-cup-of-coffee">highlighted</a> Bitcoin’s (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) utility after funds worth almost $1 billion changed hands for less than $4 in fees. The CEO pointed out that the funds were “transferred in a single transaction for the price of a cup of coffee,” referring to how easy it actually is to use BTC for huge wealth transfers without the need for government approval or middlemen.</p>
