      <p>ANKARA (Reuters) - A Turkish delegation accompanying President Tayyip Erdogan in Washington held fruitful talks with U.S. officials, Finance Minister Berat Albayrak said on Wednesday, as the NATO allies seek to overcome mounting differences.</p>
      <p>Erdogan is in Washington for talks with President Donald Trump aimed at defusing disputes ranging from Syria policy to Turkey’s purchase of the Russian S-400 missile defense systems.</p>
      <p>“We accompanied our president on his visit to Washington, which is very important for Turkey-USA ties. We participated in inter-delegation meetings that were fruitful for our cooperation,” Albayrak said on Twitter.</p>
