      <p>Filled with excitement, mystery, and a pleasant sense of unexplainable tranquillity, the deep blue seas of Oman have a lot to offer to those looking for something out of the ordinary.<br/><br/>The underwater world is a magical new dimension. The fauna are different – the bright coloured, bold patterned fish, the flora is different – huge coral reefs, plankton, and aquatic plants floating serenely, but most importantly, it is what you feel when you are in there that is different. It is calm and quiet, not in an eerie way but in a more tranquil manner. It feels like meditation in a better world. While you spend hours admiring the beauty of the unseen world around, you might even catch yourself lost in thought.</p>

      <p>“Oman looks back on a proud maritime history, renowned for Dhow building and trading across the seas. As such, Omanis are known to have a special connection with the sea, settling where there are natural harbours and great fishing grounds,” says the country’s Ministry of Tourism. It comes as no surprise that the Sultanate, with over 3,000 km of coastline and rich marine life, has become one of the world’s fastest-growing diving spots. <br/><br/>“Areas such as Al Khayran, Al Fahil Island, Daymaniyat Islands and Al Makbara Bay are incredibly popular with the discerning diver,” added the ministry. “Several tour operators specialise in water sports, such as snorkelling, sailing, jet skiing, and kayaking. For those visitors seeking their own water adventures, yachts and boats are also available for hire.”</p>
