      <h1>Mauricio Pochettino 'could face sack if Tottenham lose to London rivals West Ham'</h1>
      <h2>Spurs' horrible start to the season continued as they were again sub-standard in stuttering to a 1-1 draw against Sheffield United last weekend</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T09:39:59+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 09:39</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino faces the sack if Tottenham lose to fierce rivals <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> later this month, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Spurs' horrible start to the season continued as they were again sub-standard in stuttering to a 1-1 draw against Sheffield United last Saturday, leaving them with just three wins from their opening 12 league games.</p>
      <p>Pochettino has spoken at length about how the club were entering a "painful rebuild" after their run to the Champions League final last term, but no one envisaged just how painful things would be on the pitch as well as off it.</p>
      <p>The north Londoners have the chance to bounce back when they return to action following the current international break, with a tricky trip to the London Stadium to face West Ham in the early kick-off on Saturday, November 23.</p>

      <p>And <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/12/exclusive-time-running-pochettinos-tottenham-reign/">The Telegraph</a> has billed this London derby as make or break for Tottenham's season, claiming that a defeat would raise serious questions over Pochettino's future.</p>
      <p>Just over five months ago, Pochettino was on the brink of Champions League glory following Spurs' remarkable run to the final, the culmination of a season in which he was also heavily linked with the jobs at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> , such was his stock.</p>
      <p>Beaten by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> in that final, and following a wretched start to this season, Pochettino has now suggested he may not be given time to continue what he considers to be a rebuilding process at the club.</p>
      <p>The facts do not lie, as Spurs have won just three league games this season and only six of their last 24.</p>

      <p>Their away record is woeful too, having not won in the league away from home since January, and a loss against the struggling Hammers would mount more pressure on the Argentine boss.</p>
      <p>The manager penned a new five-year contract in May and it is claimed that it would cost chairman Daniel Levy around £12.5 million to sack him.</p>
      <p>Pochettino previously said he would like to see out the remaining three years of his contract, but hinted last weekend that he might not be given that much time as the pressure increases.</p>

      <p>"I think you can see that yes, we need to find the balance," he said.</p>
      <p>"We are building a team during the season, while competing in the Champions League and Premier League, the toughest league in the world, and always that is dangerous, this type of situation can happen.</p>
      <p>"You expect better results than you get. Of course we are in a process to build and we'll see if we have time to build what we want."</p>
