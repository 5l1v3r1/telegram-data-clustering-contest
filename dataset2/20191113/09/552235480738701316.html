      <h1>Greyhound 'traumatised' by fireworks dies after suffering cardiac arrest</h1>
      <h2>The dog, named Max, ran off after being startled by fireworks in Portobello last week.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T09:42:29+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 09:42</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Fairnie, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/robert-fairnie/</a></address>
      <p>A beloved <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/pets">greyhound</a> who suffered "trauma" following a fireworks display has tragically died.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/pets">dog</a>, named Max, ran off after being startled by fireworks in Portobello, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> last week.</p>
      <p>He managed to find his way back home, where his owners discovered that he had suffered some trauma, with a vet confirming spinal damage and a blood clot, reports <a href="https://www.edinburghlive.co.uk/news/edinburgh-news/heartbreak-greyhound-dies-after-suffering-17247630">Edinburgh Live</a> .</p>
      <p>The pet received days of treatment and while things started to improve initially, and over the next few days, Max's condition sadly deteriorated and he went into cardiac arrest at the weekend.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The Edinburgh and Lothian Lost Dogs <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> page confirmed the heartbreaking news yesterday.</p>
      <p>The post read: "Sadly he suffered some trauma and had been in the vets the past week, with confirmed spinal damage in the neck area and a blood clot from bleed from the trauma.</p>
      <p>"Things were looking to improve, with a good update last night and even this morning, but sadly an update from his mum this evening is just heartbreaking.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"Run free Max! Beautiful, beautiful boy. Thoughts with Max's family."</p>
      <p>The heartbreaking incident comes on the back of news that the Scottish Government were proposing new restrictions on the use of fireworks.</p>
      <p>Back garden displays could soon be a thing of the past while tighter time limits and blanket bans for certain "no firework zones" could also be introduced.</p>
      <p>This is following "overwhelming" public support.</p>
