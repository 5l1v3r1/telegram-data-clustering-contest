      <h1>Disney+ app out now on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T09:27:50+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 09:27</time> by <a rel="author">Stefan L</a></address>
      <p>Disney+, the house of mouse’s homegrown streaming platform launched last night, and has brought with it plenty of apps on plenty of different platforms to let you view the mega-company’s many, many films and TV shows. Everything from Star Wars (and the new Mandalorian TV show), to Marvel, classic Disney animations and recently acquired Fox shows like The Simpsons are being dragged together in this streaming service.</p>
      <p>Two of those platforms are games consoles, with Disney gracing the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One with dedicated Disney+ apps in those regions where the service is now available. With a staggered rollout across the world, the November 12 launch only included the USA, Canada and The Netherlands, which will be followed by Australia and New Zealand on 19th November. It’s expected to reach most major markets within its first two years, with the UK launch currently planned for 31st March 2020.</p>
      <p>For those who <i>can</i> currently access the service, here’s the links to the Microsoft and PlayStation app stores:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/9NXQXXLFST89?ocid=periscope">Microsoft Store</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1082-CUSA15607_00-0000000000000001">PlayStation Store</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Of course, even without a games console, there’s plenty of other ways to get access to Disney+. You can view it in a browser, get apps for Android TV, Apple TV and Roku devices, and there’s apps for Android and iOS. However, there’s notable omissions here, such as Amazon’s Fire TV and the Nintendo Switch.</p>
      <p>Disney+ combines the companies ballooning back catalogue with new shows made specifically for the service. Subscribers (it costs $6.99/mo, $69.99/yr) can download or stream to up to 10 devices with four simultaneous streams all at once and multiple user profiles. There’s also 4K UHD and HDR included from the off, which is a higher price bracket on rival streaming service Netflix.</p>
      <p>The rollout hasn’t been the smoothest for Disney, though. Demand has seen their <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/disney-plus-crashing-having-technical-issues-on-launch-day-2019-11">registration and log in servers stumble</a>, there’s complaints of The Simpsons rendering issues and that the content is being <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/disney-plus-puts-the-simpsons-in-widescreen-and-fans-are-not-happy/">cropped to a widescreen format</a>, ruining various visual gags, and yup, there’s yet another edit to the classic Star Wars trilogy. Now <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/12/20961250/star-wars-changes-han-shoots-greedo-disney-plus">Han shot at the same time</a>.</p>
      <p>OK, then?</p>
