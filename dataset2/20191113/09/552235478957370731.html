      <p>A hooded pervert touched himself in front of a terrified pensioner as she sat in her car.</p>
      <p>Cops have launched a manhunt for the weirdo who targeted the 71-year-old woman in Newmains, Renfrew.</p>
      <p>The shocking incident, which happened around 8.30pm, came to light when the “badly shaken” victim reported it to police days later.</p>
      <p>Police say the victim was sitting in her car when the creep approached her window and began rubbing his groin before making <br/>off.</p>
      <p>She was left badly shaken by the ordeal and now police are desperate to trace the fiend.</p>
      <p>He is described as being a white male, wearing dark clothing, with his hood up.</p>
      <p>Inspector Jim Cast, from Johnstone, Renfrew and the villages community policing team, appealed for witnesses to come forward to help identify suspect.</p>
      <p>He told the Paisley Daily Express: “The victim was sitting in her car in Newmains, Renfrew at around 8.30pm on Saturday night when she was approached by an unknown male.</p>
      <p>“This was clearly a very distressing incident for the victim who has been left badly shaken by what happened to her.</p>
      <p>“We are offering her our full support.</p>
      <p>“We are clearly very keen to identify who this individual is and we would appeal to anyone who may have seen what happened to come forward.”</p>
      <p>He added: “We are carrying out a range of enquiries, including checking CCTV and speaking to potential witnesses.</p>
      <p>“I would urge anyone who has CCTV in the area to speak to officers if they have not already done so.</p>
      <p>“I would also ask any drivers who were in the area to check dashcam footage to see if they may have captured anything significant.”</p>
      <p>Anyone with information should contact police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.</p>
