        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 13 – The National Building Inspectorate (NBI) has cleared two buildings in Phase I of Everest Park Estate in Athi River, Machakos County, saying the developer had addressed safety concerns raised.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Secretary National Building Inspectorate Moses Nyakiongora through a letter copied to the County Secretary Machakos County said the two blocks have been repaired adequately as per the requirements and that the owners were free to occupy them.</p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>“Following an inspection of the above-mentioned blocks, 23 September 2019 we now confirm that safety concerns raised at Everest Park Estate has been satisfactorily addressed,” stated Nyakiongora.</p>
      <p>In mid-2017, several houses at the estate developed huge cracks, prompting the inspectorate to undertake an urgent structural audit of the property.</p>
      <p>The NBI initiated a structural audit on the multi-million estate to ascertain whether the houses some of which had been sold were habitable.</p>
      <p>In their initial preliminary report last year in January, NBI condemned the building due to structural defects.</p>
      <p>The developer – Everest Park Limited – was compelled to correct the defects, of which he has since complied with.</p>
      <p>Everest Park Phase I, which was funded by Pan-African mortgage financier Shelter Afrique, comprises 240 one- to three-bedroom apartments in the Mavoko area of Athi River.</p>
      <p>The estate comprises of 120 one-bedroom units sold for Sh2.6 million each, 60 two-bedroom units priced at Sh4.6 million each and 60 three-bedroom units sold for Sh5.5 million each.</p>
      <p>Houses under the first phase of the project are already sold out and the developers are now working on Phase II of the Everest Park estate, which will see an additional 200 houses and a commercial centre built in two years.</p>
