        <b>The number of food parcels given out in the East of England has increased by almost a third in the past six months, new data has revealed - and in Ipswich, demand has hit record levels</b>
      </p>
      <p>The period between April 2019 and September 2019 the Trussell Trust was one of the busiest for the food banks since the charity opened.</p>
      <p>In these six months 84,983 three-day emergency food supplies were given to people in crisis in region, of these 32,735 went to children.</p>
      <p>The trust said that there were three main reasons as to why they needed the emergency food; benefits not covering the cost of living, and delays or changes to benefits being paid.</p>
      <p>Maureen Reynel MBE, founder of Ipswich charity FIND, said: "Demand has risen to its highest-ever levels in 2019 from adults and children in poverty and crisis in the Ipswich area.</p>
      <p>"When I started almost 30 years ago, we gave out a handful of food parcels every week. Now it's over 100. It really has escalated this year, while we've also been busy delivering beds, cookers and washing machines.</p>
      <p>"That's why we're excited to be moving into our new bigger home, thanks to the generous spirit of the local community, and to continue helping people in need.</p>
      <p>"We're also gearing up for our Christmas campaign of delivering 1,000 food parcels and we'd be extremely grateful for any donations to help cover the costs."</p>
      <p>The Trussel Trust are now calling for all of the political parties to protect people from hunger.</p>
      <p>Trussel Trust chief executive Emma Revie said: "Our benefits system is supposed to protect us all from being swept into poverty, but currently thousands of women, men and children are not receiving sufficient protection from destitution.</p>
      <p>"This is not right. But we know this situation can be fixed.</p>
      <p>"This General Election, all political parties must pledge to protect people from hunger by ensuring everyone has enough money for the basics.</p>
      <p>"We want our next government to start working towards a future where no one needs a food bank by ending the five week wait for Universal Credit; ensuring benefit payments cover the cost of living; and investing in local emergency support for people in crisis.</p>
      <p>"Together, these three changes will put money back into the pockets of people who most need our support. It's in our power as a country to end the need for food banks. This can change."</p>
