      <h1>Apprentice star Claude Littner sparks fury after suggesting nurses using foodbanks should 'work more'</h1>
      <h2>His Twitter comments said nurses struggling on low pay should take second jobs</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T09:53:50+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 09:53</time> by <a rel="author">Talia Shadwell, Matthew Dresch, Jamie Hawkins</a></address>
      <p>Apprentice star Claude Littner has sparked anger after suggesting nurses struggling to get by should work more.</p>
      <p>Claude, who is an advisor on Lord Alan Sugar's BBC One show, said that nurses who are low-paid should take second jobs.</p>
      <p>His comments saying it would be "less demeaning than visiting a food bank" saw the British-American businessman come under fire, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/apprentice-star-tells-nurses-should-20870127">The Mirror</a> reports.</p>
      <p>The 70-year-old then doubled down on his views on struggling nurses on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> despite a flood of criticism.</p>
      <p>He wrote: "If a nurse or anyone else need to make ends meet, nothing wrong with extending hours or finding part-time work."</p>
      <p>Many critics were quick to point out that many NHS nurses already work long hours for low pay, and their shift work affected their ability to find second jobs.</p>

      <p>But Mr Littner wrote there was: "Nothing wrong with extending hours or finding part time work."</p>
      <p>His comments come as reports of nurses forced to resort to using Britain's foodbanks.</p>

      <p>Twitter uses slammed Mr Littner's suggestions, telling him shift-working nurses were "exhausted."</p>
      <p>Some warned that forcing nurses to take on extra work would leave them tired and stressed, and ultimately could endanger patients.</p>

      <p>However Mr Littner refused to back down, telling the Twittersphere his own niece was a nurse.</p>
      <p>The British-American businessman claimed she managed to hold down a side-hustle, tweeting: "My niece is a nurse &amp; has an online business that generates income.. result torrent of abuse!"</p>

      <p>In a later post, defending himself from the onslaught of criticism, he said: "No good deed goes unpunished! I responded to a nurse who stated that she could not make ends meet. I suggested that as a stop gap she might find some part time work to make ends meet."</p>
      <p>But some who responded to Mr Littner's tweets suggested the businessman was out of touch.</p>
      <p>Twitter user Claire Yuen wrote: "This response surprises me.. we can't all work for Lord Alan Sugar and have a 6-figure salary!</p>

      <p>"I thought you would have expressed the disgust in how little our NHS and emergency service workers actually earn. My opinion on you has changed Claude, what a shame."</p>
      <p>Mr Littner retweeted some Twitter users who supported his views, with some saying that nurses had made a choice to follow that career path and shouldn't "whinge" about the outcome.</p>
      <p>Mr Littner also wrote that he respected nurses, acknowledging there is a national shortage and that he believed they should be paid properly: "Nursing is a fine profession. No question nurses work long hours, take on responsibility and should be remunerated accordingly."</p>
