      <p>"The positive inflow indicates building up of a positive investment trend. Series of steps taken by the government in the recent times to boost domestic economy had improved sentiments and helped the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/markets">markets </a>to surge. This has helped investors slowly gain confidence and get back to investing," said Himanshu Srivastava, senior analyst, manager research, Morningstar Investment Adviser India.</p>
      <p>Going ahead, experts believe that equity <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/markets">markets </a>would perform better in the coming months due to positive initiatives taken by the government, which will drive further inflows in <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/markets-mutual-funds-1060701.htm">mutual funds </a>through the SIP route.</p>
