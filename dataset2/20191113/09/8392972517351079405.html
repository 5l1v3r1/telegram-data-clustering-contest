      <p>TV's <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/piers-morgan/">Piers Morgan</a> has admitted his future on <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/good-morning-britain/">Good Morning Britain</a> isn't set yet after ITV extended the show.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, it was revealed that <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/jeremy-kyle-show/itv-finally-confirms-the-jeremy-kyle-show-replacement/">the daytime show will run for an extra 30 minutes each day</a> in a huge schedule shake-up.</p>
      <p>Piers and co-star Susanna Reid celebrated the news on Wednesday's programme but he revealed he hasn't yet negotiated a contract about hosting the show longer.</p>

      <p>Susanna said: "For some reason this programme, and probably down to you [Piers], has been extended.</p>
      <p>"From January, we will be on air Piers Morgan until 9 o'clock in the morning," as the presenters clapped and cheered.</p>
      <p>Piers said: "The show will yeah. The show has been extended until 9 o’clock and let’s just say I haven’t been secured for that period yet."</p>
      <p>Susanna said: "This is when you do your contract negotiations live on air."</p>
      <p>Piers replied: "I prefer to be honest. So, we'll see."</p>

      <p>Charlotte Hawkins asked him: "So you might just get up at half-past eight and go?"</p>
      <p>Piers said: "I might not be here," to which Susanna clarified: "The idea is that he might not be here at all."</p>
      <aside>Let’s just say I haven’t been secured for that period yet.</aside>
      <p>Piers continued: "It just depends really if the public want me or not. I am sure viewers would like nothing more than have Adil Ray replace me full time. Wouldn't you viewers?"</p>
      <p>Susanna hit back: "There's no problem with viewing figures when Adil Ray's on," to which Piers quipped: "Really? Well, the one's I saw absolutely tanked."</p>
      <p>It comes after ITV announced changes to the daytime schedule.</p>
