      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/chelsea">Chelsea</a> manager <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/FrankLampard">Frank Lampard</a> has imposed a strict disciplinary regime on his young squad with a series of hefty fines, including £20,000 for being late for the start of training.</p>
      <p>Blues players are also charged £500 for every minute they are late to team meetings, it is understood.</p>
      <p>Any player not reporting an illness or injury before a day off or an hour-and-a-half before training can expect a £10,000 fine, while lateness for treatment, medical appointments or matchday departure will cost £2,500.</p>
      <p>A phone ringing during a team meal or meeting will set a Chelsea player back £1,000, as will wearing the wrong clothing for team travel or matchdays.</p>
      <p>It is understood the leaked list of penalties, which is entitled ‘Chelsea FC first team internal player fines season 2019-20’ and was initially published by the Daily Mail, is accurate.</p>
      <p>The list is dated August 27 and signed by Lampard.</p>
      <p>The fines are doubled if not paid within 14 days, with the money going towards team activities and charities.</p>
      <p>Being late for the report time for training will cost players £2,500, plus the same amount for every 15 minutes thereafter.</p>
      <p>Other fines include £5,000 for not turning up to fulfil corporate or community duties, the same amount for not travelling back from a match on the team coach without giving 48 hours notice and £1,000 for a late appearance at the gym.</p>
      <p>Lampard took over at Stamford Bridge in the summer and his strict regime appears to be working, with his side lying third in the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/PremierLeague">Premier League</a> table after a run of six straight league wins.</p>
