      <h3>AGENTS of the Philippine National Police Anti-Kidnapping Group (PNP-AKG) have been ordered to further step-up their crackdown on Chinese nationals involved in casino-related kidnappings in the country amid increasing number of Chinamen being arrested for the crime, the Journal Group learned yesterday.</h3>
      <p>Over a dozen Chinese nationals since last month have been arrested for abducting or trying to abduct their compatriots who owed them money, some of the victims grabbed outside the Ninoy Aquino International Airport even in broad daylight.</p>
      <p>The incidents came in the wake of a highly-successful PNP-AKG-initiated summit on casino-related kidnappings which  have offered a vast array of solutions specifically a ‘whole of government approach’ to address the menace, the Journal Group was told.</p>
      <p>PNP-AKG director, Colonel Jonnel C. Estomo said they fully appreciated the inputs of the participants including officials of China and South Korea Embassies in Manila and guest of honor and speaker, Department of Justice Senior Deputy State Prosecutor Richard Anthony D. Fadullon.</p>
      <p>It was Fadullon who called for a ‘whole-of-nation’ approach in arresting the growing incidents of casino-related kidnappings.</p>
      <p>“The attention of the local authorities are being diverted to casino-related kidnappings which is just a coercive scheme of loan sharks in collecting the borrowed money by the better-victims, from real kidnapping cases wherein the families of the victims and the victims themselves are more than willing to push through a case against the kidnappers and consequently have them punished in accordance with the law,” Fadullon, also the chairman of the Anti-Kidnapping Task Force said.</p>
      <p>The PNP-AKG said that in 2017, they recorded 52 casino-related kidnapping cases, the same year when the operation of POGOs started in the country.  Since 2017, the PNP-AKG said that a total of 112 Asian nationals including 106 from Mainland China have been arrested by PNP agents for their involvement in ‘casino-related’ kidnappings-for-ransom.</p>
      <p>Apart from the 106 Chinese nationals, there were two Malaysians, four Koreans and seven Filipinos arrested for involvement in the same caper from 2017 to date, the period which saw 56 foreigners being abducted by casino loan shark syndicates and forced to pay huge amount of ransom for their safe release, said Estomo.</p>
      <p>PNP-AKG records said that in 2017, there were 16 Chinese, one Singaporean and two Koreans who became victims of 17 these kidnappings. In  2018, the PNP-AKG recorded 16 ‘kidnappings’ which led in the abduction of 17 Chinese mainlanders.</p>
      <p>So far this year, the PNP-AKG has already investigated over 20 ‘casino-related’ kidnappings which saw the abduction of 15 Chinese, one Australian, one Korean, one American and two Malaysians.</p>
      <p>Estomo said that of the 119 suspects arrested from 2017 to date, the biggest number was recorded in 2017 with 59 suspects composed of 50 Chinese, seven Filipinos and two Malaysians. In 2018, a total of 17 Chinese nationals were arrested for the same illegal activity. So far this year, a total of 39 Chinese and four Koreans have been arrested.</p>
      <p>The PNP-AKG said that some of the victims were forced to pay ‘ransom’ ranging from 100 million RMB, P3 billion, 25 million RMB and 15 million RMB to the casino loan shark gangs.</p>
      <p>Two Saturdays ago, PNP-AKG agents arrested  seven Chinese nationals accused of kidnapping and torturing a female compatriot who tried to quit her work after discovering that it was an illegal online company.</p>
      <p>It turned out that the victim, a 27-year old woman from Hebei, China was recruited as a personnel assistant of Ekxinum Incorporation with address of Building 8314 in Zambales Highway, Upper Cubi, Subic Bay, Freeport Zone in Morong, Bataan.</p>
      <p>When she learned she was working in a company involved in illegal online gambling, she decided to quit prompting the suspects to seize and beat her. She was also told that they will only let her go if her family abroad will pay them the 19,000 RMB she owed them.</p>
      <p>Acting on the information, the PNP-AKG conducted the operation which led in the arrest of the seven and the rescue of the victim.</p>
