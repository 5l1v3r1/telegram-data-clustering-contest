      <p>Andy Shauf’s upcoming <i>The Neon Skyline</i> is a concept album about a guy who goes to his local dive bar, hears his ex is back in town, and inevitably runs into her. Our first sample of that storyline was “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2062168/andy-shauf-things-i-do-neon-skyline/music/">Things I Do</a>,” which flashes back on the relationship’s demise. Today we get to further piece together the narrative with the release of a second single, “Try Again.”</p>
      <p>The lyrics to this one read like a short story: “Somewhere between drunkenness and chivalry, I hold the door open and let her pass through. She says thanks to me in a British accent and I try to answer her in the same voice. She laughs at me, says ‘What was that supposed to be?’ I say ‘I’m sorry, I’m from a different part of the country.’ She says ‘Come on baby, try again.'” This encounter and others is set to a vibrant retro pop-rock arrangement the likes of which Shauf has become known for.</p>
      <p>It’s really quite pretty, and so is its fun animated video, directed by Gérald Fleury and Timo Hateau of Mizotte &amp; Cabécou. The directors explain, “Rather than illustrating the storyline, we imagined our own offbeat tale like a parallel to the song. Design, motion, colors and atmosphere are influenced by the pop and childish dream world of ’70s French animation (<i>Chapi Chapo</i>, <i>The Magic Roundabout</i>).”</p>
