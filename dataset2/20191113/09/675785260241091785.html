      <h2>Paul Merson believes Arsenal have regressed under Unai Emery and says his former club missed a golden opportunity to let the Spaniard go this week</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T09:25:32+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 09:25</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Paul Merson reckons Arsenal missed the golden opportunity to sack Unai Emery, adding the Spaniard is fortunate to still be in a job.</p>
      <p>The Gunners have struggled under Emery this season, and a section of the fanbase have started to get on his back.</p>
      <p>The board have come out in support of the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> boss in recent weeks, despite results continuing to go against the club.</p>
      <p>Emery is in little danger of being sacked at the moment, but former Gunners midfielder Merson thinks Arsenal need to reconsider their stance.</p>
      <p>He says the club have regressed under the Spaniard, and that they should have parted company with him at the start of the international break.</p>

      <p>"Looking at what's to come with Arsenal, the fixtures, I think he's there for the long run," Merson told Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>"I think this was a prime [time] to say 'right, let's get someone in, this hasn't worked, bring a manager in, got five or six unbelievable football games to come up, get off to a great start, and then we go from there'.</p>
      <p>"I think he's very fortunate."</p>
      <p>Arsene Wenger left the Gunners after 22 years in charge when things started going wrong for the Frenchman.</p>

      <p>Wenger's Arsenal won 85 points from a possible 150 in his final 50 games in charge, while Emery's Gunners have collected just 87 in his first 50 in charge.</p>
      <p>The stats suggest Arsenal have made little progression under Emery, and Merson believes they've actually regressed.</p>
      <p>"I don't see any change at Arsenal. They don't keep clean sheets, they let in goals for fun and do you know the worst thing about it now?</p>

      <p>"They don't even really look like scoring goals, which is the thing with me.</p>
      <p>"With Arsenal, they always looked like they were going to score goals, even though they would be ropy at the back. But I don't see that happening now.</p>
