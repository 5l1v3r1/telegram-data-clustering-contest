      <h1>Luke Pollard's office attacked again with more homophobic graffiti</h1>
      <h2>'I am not going to be made a victim of by people with hate in their hearts'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T09:33:14+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 09:33</time> by <a rel="author">Sarah Waddington</a></address>
      <p>MP candidate Luke Pollard has had his city centre office attacked again overnight with more homophobic graffiti.</p>
      <p>At the end of October Mr Pollard's Frankfort Gate office was vandalised twice in one week.</p>
      <p>On October 27 <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/local-news/vandal-sprays-die-blair-plymouth-3449627">an anti-gay slur was daubed on the Labour politician's office</a> windows, after previously <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/vandal-targets-plymouth-mps-office-3470965">being vandalised previously seven days before</a> .</p>
      <p>At the time he praised the "most incredible and positive reaction from people in Plymouth" in response to the incident.</p>
      <p>But now his office has been vandalised yet again, with the MP candidate, who is up for re-election on December 12 in the forthcoming general election, saying he is "not going to be made a victim of by people with hate in their hearts".</p>
      <p>Mr Pollard said: "My office was graffitied again last night with more homophobic slurs. I've offered to sit down with the individuals who have done this to listen to their concerns; that request has been ignored and they've clearly sent a message here again that they want to continue their homophobic attacks on me.</p>
      <p>"I'm not going to be made a victim of by people who have hate in their hearts, nor am I going to let my staff that work so hard from this office, helping people with homelessness, with Universal Credit problems, with housing issues be threatened and feel unsafe going to work."</p>

      <p>He added: "We've already had the police here this morning and I want to thank them for their swift action today. We'll be cooperating fully with them and we'll be seeking to identify the individuals involved in this.</p>
      <p>"Hard to read what it says today, but some words are quite clear. There is no place for homophobia, no place for hate, no place for bigotry in our city and it is important that all of us calls it out."</p>

      <p>The Labour MP added that the actions do not represent the majority of people in Plymouth.</p>
      <p>"There is no place for hate and abuse in Plymouth," he said previously.</p>
      <p>Fellow Plymouth MP candidate Johnny Mercer said in response to the second incident: "This is simply unacceptable in our city.</p>
      <p>"Disagree with him all you like - and I do, but Iâ€™ll forever defend his right to go about his life without this appalling abuse."</p>
      <p>Security has been tightened up at the <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> Remainer's Frankfort Gate surgery after it was targeted by rebel campaigners.</p>
      <p>Employees working on behalf of the staunch Remainer were issued with panic alarms in the months prior after receiving chilling rape from <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/disturbed-asylum-seeker-threatened-rape-3055676">racist Azad Jalilwand</a> - later jailed for his vile actions.</p>
      <p>It comes amid guidance issued to MPs nationally warning them to be on extra alert in the run up to the December 12 General Election - with some choosing not to go out and canvass at all after 5pm for fear they'll be targeted.
