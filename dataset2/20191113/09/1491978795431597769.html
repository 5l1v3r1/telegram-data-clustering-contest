        <i>US electric carmaker will build battery factory in Berlin, says boss Elon Musk</i>
      </p>
      <p>The Tesla chief executive, Elon Musk, has said Brexit uncertainty played a role in the firm’s decision to build <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/08/tesla-adds-german-firm-grohmann-to-european-operations">its first European factory</a> in Germany rather than the UK.</p>
      <p>The billionaire entrepreneur revealed that the firm’s European battery plant would be built on the outskirts of Berlin.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/tesla/108395/tesla-gigafactory-europe-to-be-built-in-germany-not-uk-as-elon-musk-blames-brexit">Speaking to Auto Express</a> after making the announcement, Musk said: “Brexit [uncertainty] made it too risky to put a Gigafactory in the UK.”</p>
      <p>The US electric carmaker also plans to locate a research and development base in the German capital. Musk announced the Berlin decision at a car industry awards ceremony on Tuesday night hosted by the German tabloid Bild.</p>

Everyone knows that German engineering is outstanding, for sure, and that’s part of the reason why we are locating our Gigafactory Europe in Germany. We are also going to create an engineering and design centre in Berlin.”</p>

      <p>Aside from batteries, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/tesla">Tesla</a> will also build its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in Berlin. Production is expected to start in 2021. Musk told the awards audience: “I come to Berlin a lot – Berlin rocks!”</p>
