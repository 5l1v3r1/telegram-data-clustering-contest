      <p>In <i><a href="https://dr-d-king.itch.io/tiny-islands">Tiny Islands</a></i>, by David King, you're dealt cards that let you "draw" particular landscape features on a grid, with occasional breaks to draw coastlines around the forests, mountains, villages and churches you place. Once you've gotten through the deck, your archipelago is scored based according to rules of proximity and placement. It's simple, frustrating and very addictive, with games over in a few minutes and a better high-score always at hand. I've managed to get in the 60s (check out <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MyTinyIslands">the hashtag</a> for more)—what about you?</p>
