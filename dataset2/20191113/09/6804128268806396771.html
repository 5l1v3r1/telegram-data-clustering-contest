      <h1>Six West Ham players needing to find form during the international break</h1>
      <h2>West Ham news | Manuel Pellegrini will be without six of his stars for the coming days but will hope they find form away from east London</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T09:01:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 09:01</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Inkersole</a></address>
      <p>Six senior Hammers players have been called up for their international squads over the next week or so and Manuel Pellegrini will be hoping they can all find some match form while away from the capital.</p>
      <p>West Ham's big downturn in form, winless in their last six Premier League games and just one victory in the last nine, has seen them plummet from joint-third in the table to 16th in the space of six weeks as they have thrown away their good start to the campaign.</p>
      <p>It doesn't get any easier either as on the horizon are tough games against Spurs, Chelsea, Wolves and Arsenal for Pellegrini's under-performing squad.</p>
      <p>While the majority of players will be at Rush Green, training as normal, six of them won't be there and will hope to feature in games to try and find some much-needed form to bring back with them for the visit of Spurs to London Stadium on November 23.</p>
      <p>So who is in action over the next few days and where will they be featuring?</p>
      <h3>Declan Rice</h3>
      <p>While he's not really out of form, he is certainly going through a dip in recent weeks which is arguably his first since establishing himself as a first team regular.</p>
      <p>That has seen some say his place in England's team is under threat but Rice will be looking to prove those doubters wrong when England play Montenegro at Wembley on Thursday, needing just a point to secure qualification for EURO 2020.</p>
      <p>If they fall to do it on Thursday, then the Three Lions have their first ever trip to Kosovo as a second bite of the cherry on Sunday.</p>
      <h3>Andriy Yarmolenko</h3>

      <p>After his burst of form which saw him score three goals prior to the 2-2 draw at Bournemouth and the beginning of the slump, Yarmolenko has been off-colour in recent performances.</p>
      <p>He has been called up to the Ukraine squad once again, who have already booked their spot at EURO 2020 so the pressure is off for the Hammers winger. That said, he'll be hoping to get back on the goal trail for his national squad as they take on Serbia in their final qualifier on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The Ukrainians also have a friendly before that as they face Estonia in Zaporizhia.</p>

      <hr/>
      <h3>Albian Ajeti</h3>
      <p>It's been a tough start for the Switzerland striker who has yet to get off the mark for his new club after his Â£8m move from Basel to east London in the summer - albeit in limited game time.</p>
      <p>That hasn't stopped the Swiss side calling him up for the national team and they have two big games as they attempt to overhaul both Denmark and Ireland in Group D of EURO 2020 qualifying.</p>
      <p>They have a good chance though as they play the bottom two in the group in consecutive games, Georgia and Gibraltar and Ajeti will be hoping to find some goalscoring form to bring back to the capital.</p>
      <h3>Arthur Masuaku</h3>
      <p>It's been such a strange season for the Hammers left back who has either played the full 90 minutes in a game or not been in the squad at all - aside from his sending off at Aston Villa of course.</p>
      <p>Masuaku has played just once in the league since then, the 2-0 defeat at Everton, as Aaron Cresswell has been named as the regular left back for Pellegrini.</p>
      <p>He has been called up for the DR Congo squad though and Masuaku will be playing in the AFCON 2021 qualifiers against Gabon and Gambia as the qualifying stage gets underway.</p>
      <h3>Fabian Balbuena</h3>

      <p>The centre half has been back in the team for the past three games but has not been playing well, so needs to find some form for Paraguay having been called up by his country.</p>
      <p>They have two friendly matches over the coming days. Firsty, they face Bulgaria in Levski on Thursday before travelling to the Middle East to take on Saudi Arabia at 5pm on Tuesday.</p>
      <h3>Winston Reid</h3>
      <p>For the New Zealand defender, it's not about finding form as it hasn't dropped off, he just needs minutes after a long injury lay-off. Though <b>football.london </b>understands the Hammers aren't too happy that he has been called up for Kiwi's latest squad.</p>
      <p>Reid hasn't played Premier League football for 19 months, had three outings in pre-season at 45 minutes a pop and 65 minutes for the U23s just last week but that's it.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, there is no arduous travel for Reid involved as the All Whites take on the Republic of Ireland in Dublin for a friendly contest on Thursday.</p>
