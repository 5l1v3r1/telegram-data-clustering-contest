      <p>Nobody loves an em-dash more than I do — I put an em-dash on anything. It really is a wonderful grammatical tool. You can use it to dictate the pace of your writing, to bring more attention to an argument, to add extra information without cluttering a sentence. It truly is a gift to writing — and you should absolutely use it.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, the em-dash — and the en-dash (–) for that matter — is not popular enough to deserve its own place on the keyboard. Instead, you’ll need to use a shortcut. The problem is the shortcut varies across operating systems.</p>
      <p>No worries, we’re here to help. Here’s how to type em-dashes and en-dashes on both Mac and Windows systems.</p>
      <h3>macOS</h3>
      <p>Admittedly, Mac makes it easier to use em- and en-dashes than Windows. There’s a pretty simple shortcut which works on laptops and desktop macOS systems by default.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To type an en-dash, you’ll need to press the Alt key and the Minus key at the same time. That’s it, you’ve now got an en-dash (–).</li>
        <li>The em-dash works similarly — it merely requires one extra key. Hold down Alt + Shift + Minus for an em-dash. Boom, that’s it.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Pretty simple, right? Now onto Windows.</p>
      <h3>Windows</h3>
      <p>Windows tends to be a little less friendly to dash admirers, but things have gotten better with the release <a href="https://thenextweb.com/microsoft/2019/06/15/how-to-easily-type-emoji-emoticons-and-symbols-in-windows-10/">of its own emoji keyboard</a> — it’s actually got a somewhat convenient shortcut for em and en-dashes built into it.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Press the Win key and the dot (.) at the same time to get to the emoji keyboard.</li>
        <li>At the top of the keyboard, navigate to the symbols menu (the omega icon).</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>You should see the en- and em-dashes towards the bottom of the keyboard.</li>
        <li>You’re done!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Another alternative is to use Alt codes. There’s a catch, however: Alt codes don’t always work on laptop keyboards. This was the case with the <a href="https://thenextweb.com/plugged/2019/10/17/razer-blade-laptop-macbook-windows/">Razer Blade, which I recently tested</a>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>For an em-dash, hold down the Alt key and type 0151, then release the Alt key. That’s it!</li>
        <li>For an en-dash, hold down the Alt key and type 0150, then release the Alt key. Pretty simple, right?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Well, that’s it. Now you know how to use en- and em-dashes on Mac and Windows.</p>
