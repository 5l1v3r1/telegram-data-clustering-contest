      <h1>GitHub Faces More Resignations In Light of ICE Contract</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T09:20:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 09:20</time> by <a rel="author">BeauHD</a></address>
      <p>TechCrunch reports that another employee, engineer Alice Goldfuss, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/13/github-faces-more-resignations-in-light-of-ice-contract/">has resigned from GitHub</a> over the company's <a href="https://yro.slashdot.org/story/19/09/21/0133217/developer-takes-down-ruby-library-after-he-finds-out-ice-was-using-it">$200,000 contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> (ICE). From the report: <i>In a tweet, Goldfuss <a href="https://twitter.com/alicegoldfuss/status/1194666475325231104">said</a> GitHub has a number of problems to address and that "ICE is only the latest." Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/evjwwp/as-githubs-conference-begins-five-employees-resign-over-protest-ice-contract">Vice reports at least five staffers quit today</a>. These resignations come the same day as GitHub Universe, the company's big product conference. Ahead of the conference, Tech Workers Coalition protested the event, setting up a cage to represent where ICE detains children. <br/><br/>Last month, GitHub staff engineer Sophie Haskins resigned, stating she was leaving because the company did not cancel its contract with ICE, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2019-10-31/github-ice-contract-defense">The Los Angeles Times reported</a>. Last month, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/letter-from-github-employees-to-ceo-about-the-company-s-ice-contract/fb280de9-2bc3-40d5-b1a5-e3b954bf0d25/">GitHub employees penned</a> an open letter urging the company to stop working with ICE. That came following GitHub's <a href="https://github.blog/2019-10-09-github-and-us-government-developers/">announcement</a> of a $500,000 donation to nonprofit organizations in support of "immigrant communities targeted by the current administration." In that announcement, GitHub CEO Nat Friedman said ICE's purchase was made through one of GitHub's reseller partners and said the deal is not "financially material" for the company. Friedman also pointed out that ICE is responsible for more than immigration and detention facilities.</i></p>
