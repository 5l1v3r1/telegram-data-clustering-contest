      <p>Ozzy Osbourne is still recovering from a fall he suffered in February, his wife Sharon has said.</p>
      <p>The rocker, 70, had an accident at home earlier this year, aggravating injuries from a near-fatal quad bike crash in 2003.</p>
      <p>The latest injuries forced the former Black Sabbath star to reschedule dates on a European tour.</p>

      <p>Sharon told Good Morning Britain: “He’s on the mend.</p>
      <p>“He had that very, very bad fall in February of this year but he’s getting there, he’s getting better.”</p>
      <p>Sharon was also asked about X Factor and her relationship with Simon Cowell.</p>
      <p>It had been reported that she was axed as a judge on the 2018 X Factor over comments she had made about the show, but she later said it had been her decision to pull out of the programme.</p>

      <p>Sharon said of Simon Cowell: “I’m talking but I haven’t spoken to him in so long, last May was the last time.</p>
      <p>“Not this year but the year before. So it’s been a while.”</p>
      <p>She added of Cowell’s appearance: “I think he looks absolutely great. The teeth are a bit big and one eye’s kinda droopy but I think he looks great.”</p>
