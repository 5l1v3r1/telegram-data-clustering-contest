      <h1>Tech N9ne Challenges Eminem Haters To Defend Their Culture Vulture Claim</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T09:27:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 09:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://hiphopdx.com/author/Kyle%20Eustice" target="_blank">Kyle Eustice</a></address>
      <p>Ah, the culture vulture argument, one that seemingly never dies. White rappers <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53221/title.benzino-reiterates-his-opinion-eminem-is-not-in-the-culture">(<i>ahem,</i> Eminem)</a> are constantly slapped with that label — no matter their skills or diamond-selling status.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday (November 12), <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53207/title.krizz-kaliko-shocks-tech-n9ne-strange-music-their-fans-by-re-signing-at-red-rocks-concert">Tech N9ne</a> shared a black-and-white video clip to his Instagram account, explaining how he’s influenced by all types of music, including gospel, blues R&amp;B, rock, jazz and, of course, Hip Hop.</p>
      <p>He then broached the culture vulture topic.</p>
      <p>“I am just doing music that I love and feel,” he said. “Not only do I do Hip Hop shows, I do rock shows and festivals and shit. I can open for <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53415/title.kanye-west-threatens-to-change-his-name-to-christian-genius-billionaire-kanye-west">Kanye</a> and 2 Chainz and the next day do Knotfest, nigga! I’ve done it. In that order.</p>
      <p>“So when you see me at rock shows and you know my base is in Hip Hop, does that make me a culture vulture? NO! So, what the fuck y’all saying about Eminem then? Like he didn’t grow up listening to Hip Hop. Y’all know he did.”</p>

      <p><a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.51142/title.eminem-to-release-slim-shady-lp-20th-anniversary-merch">Slim Shady</a> has been accused of being a culture vulture numerous times.The legendary Stevie Wonder once referred to him that way for criticizing the late Michael Jackson.</p>
      <p>Naturally, Shady’s <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53381/title.lord-jamar-calls-out-eminem-for-wearing-will-smith-blackface-mask">most outspoken critic</a> Lord Jamar couldn’t help himself and weighed in on the matter during one of his numerous sessions on DJ Vlad’s couch.</p>
      <p>“Don’t come here trying to disrespect our cultural icons like, how dare you?” he said. “Who do you think you are?”</p>
      <p>Evidently, Tecca Nina disagrees.</p>
