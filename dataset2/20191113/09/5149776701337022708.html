      <h1>Mum transforms her kitchen just £200 and reveals how she did it</h1>
      <h2>The 26-year-old didn't have to splash out a ton of cash</h2>

      <p>A money-saving mum has revealed how she managed to completely transform her kitchen without spending a ton of money.</p>
      <p>Charlotte Greedy, 26, from Pontyclun, used ingenuity without splashing out.</p>
      <p>"I came up with the idea when I desperately wanted a new kitchen but just couldn’t afford to buy a brand new one," Charlotte told money-saving community   <a href="https://latestdeals.co.uk/">LatestDeals.co.uk</a> .</p>
      <p>"I then had the idea of painting it all to mimic a new kitchen. I bought stick on tiles from a company called Tic Tac Tiles on Amazon to cover my existing tiles and bought Good Home North pole paint from B&amp;Q and painted my worktops!"</p>
      <p>But she didn't stop there, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/money-saving-mum-pulls-stunning-20865115">reports the Mirror.</a></p>

      <p>"I then painted my cupboards using Good Home Durable Delware Satin Multi-Surface paint," she explained.</p>
      <p>"I used a mini gloss roller from Poundstretcher to apply both the worktop and cupboard paint, and only used a little brush for the hard to get to parts!</p>
      <p>"I changed all my cupboard handles, again purchased from B&amp;Q, and I changed my own plug sockets from white to chrome.</p>
      <p>"I bought my flooring off eBay and used a pen knife and spray glue to fit it, and changed my light fitting to a brighter light. It cost around £200 to completely change the kitchen.”</p>

      <p>And Charlotte, who posts shots of her home renovations on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/missgreedyshome/?hl=en">@missgreedyshome</a> , is made up with her kitchen transformation, saying it even makes cooking for her two boys better.</p>
      <p>"I am absolutely in love with the transformation and it's made my kitchen look brand new," she said.</p>
      <p>"Once the kitchen was complete I felt like I could be proud of my kitchen, something I never was.</p>
      <p>"Whenever I go in there now I absolutely love it instead of loathing to go and make dinner!"</p>
