        <b>Mick McCarthy has confirmed that Troy Parrott, Lee O’Connor and Jack Byrne will start for the Republic of Ireland on Thursday night.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ireland play New Zealand in a friendly at the Aviva Stadium and three of the country’s most promising young players will start the game.</p>
      <p>Parrott, at 17, will become the youngest player to feature for Ireland since Robbie Keane, who made his international debut at the same age.</p>

      <p>The Tottenham Hotspur forward has only made one senior appearance so far in his career, in an EFL Cup tie against Colchester United, but has excelled at underage levels.</p>
      <p>In his last game for Spurs’ Under-23 team, against Red Star Belgrade, Parrott scored four times.</p>
      <p>“Troy is a bright intelligent, footballer,” McCarthy said at a press conference in Wednesday morning.</p>
      <p>“They get caught between the Under-23s and the seniors. He got four goals in his last game against Red Star.”</p>

      <p>McCarthy also said he was impressed with what he has seen from Parrott in training.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think I’ve seen Troy’s full potential,” he said.</p>
      <blockquote>“He did something yesterday where the ball came into him he turned and got his shot away it was terrific.”</blockquote>

      <p>Parrott will make his Ireland debut alongside fellow Dubliner Jack Byrne, who is set to make his first start for his country. Byrne set up in two goals in a substitute appearance against Bulgaria in September.</p>
      <p>The midfielder has had a tremendous year in Irish football, where he helped <a href="https://punditarena.com/football/robredmond/jack-byrne-fai-cup-final-dundalk-shamrock-rovers/">Shamrock Rovers win the FAI Cup</a> and won the PFA Player of the Year award.</p>

      <p>Waterford native Lee O’Connor will also make his debut in the game.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old Celtic right-back, who joined the Scottish club from Manchester United, has impressed for Stephen Kenny’s Under-21 team and will get his chance for the senior team against the All Whites.</p>
