      <p>“Designing and coordinating the action sequences for the Bond franchise requires a non-compromising mindset,” Lee Morrison, James Bond stunt coordinator, comments. “We needed an unstoppable vehicle to help us battle against the elements, steep descents, and river crossings so we chose the new Defender. I'm beyond impressed that the Defender is not only back but much, much better!”</p>
      <p>The Defenders you’ll see in the movie are no standard cars. The automaker’s design team worked in close cooperation with the people from the Special Effects and Action Vehicles division of James Bond to create unique models, based on the Defender X model in Santorini Black. They feature darkened skid pans, 20-inch black wheels, and special off-road tires. These cars were among the first to be built at Land Rover’s new plant in Nitra, Slovakia.</p>
