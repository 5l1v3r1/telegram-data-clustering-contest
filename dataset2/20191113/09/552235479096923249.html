      <p>A brute has come under onslaught after he was secretly filmed battering his dog during a walk.</p>
      <p>Grainy footage shows the man kicking his white lurcher Lucky as he strolled across Ayr Racecourse.</p>
      <p>A man with initials PM, said to live in Whitletts, has been named as the figure with the dog.</p>
      <p>He he been universally condemned online after the movie went viral.</p>
      <p>It was filmed by horrified dog-lover Ruby Lane from the car park at Tesco.</p>
      <p>The dog is kicked a number of times and Ruby claimed after she stopped filming he picked up his dog and abused it again.</p>
      <p>The lurcher is seen faithfully following at his left side and it looks as if he throws something at it.</p>
      <p>He then kicks it three times with his left foot, before looking round and kicking it a fourth time.</p>
      <p>Ruby was with her baby when she started filming last Monday.</p>
      <p>She said: “The SSPCA and the police both know about the video and will get more evidence from Tesco and the racecourse.</p>
      <p>“People like him should not have pets.</p>
      <p>“A few minutes later he stopped and grabbed the dog by the throat and punched it a few times.”</p>
      <p>The footage was shared nearly 2000 times and attracted over 600 scathing comments.</p>
      <p>Liz Boxall said: “Pity the poor dog never attacked him.”</p>
      <p>And Janice Mcnamee added: “Just glad this lady caught this on video, she has done her best and phoned the right people.</p>
      <p>“There should be no hiding place for him now.”</p>
      <p>Ayr police said no formal complaint had been lodged, but a spokesman added: "If anyone witnessed the incident call our 101 number."</p>
