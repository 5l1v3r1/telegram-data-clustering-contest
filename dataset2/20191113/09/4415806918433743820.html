      <h1>Paschal Donohoe 'recoiled' from Noel Grealish's comments about Nigeria</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T09:16:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 09:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/vivienne-clarke/" target="_blank">By Vivienne Clarke</a></address>
      <p>Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe has asked why Independent TD Noel Grealish was singling out one country in his comments about the level of remittances to Nigeria.</p>
      <p>Mr Donohoe said he “recoiled” from Mr Grealish’s comments and queried where the Galway West TD was “getting his figures.”</p>
      <p>The Minister said that according to CSO figures the amount of remittances from Ireland to Nigeria is €17m per year.</p>
      <p>There are very clear laws with regard to remittances, he said. "I am not aware that there are flows of funding from Ireland to any country that is a cause for any investigation."</p>
      <p>Speaking on RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland, Mr Donohoe said, Noel Grealish should clarify information he has with regard to any country.</p>

      <p>On the same programme, Dr Ebun Joseph, a lecturer in black studies in UCD, said that Mr Grealish was effectively saying that “black money” should be policed differently.</p>
      <p>“He is saying let us treat this group of people differently based on their nationality.”</p>
      <p>People like the Independent TD were “nothing but Donald Trump wannabees, wondering who can I hate the most?”</p>
      <p>Dr Joseph called for sanctions to stop people “spinning lies unchecked”. People who remained silent were also complicit, she added.</p>
