      <h1>Racing 92 have finally issued a statement regarding the absent Leone Nakarawa</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T09:50:15+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 09:50</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Heagney</a></address>
      <p>Racing 92 have confirmed they have “provisionally laid off” <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/racing-92/players/leone-nakarawa/">Leone Nakarawa</a> following the Fijian player’s failure to report for club duty in <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/france">France</a> following the World Cup in Japan.</p>
      <p>It has been claimed that Nakarawa is <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/he-is-not-present-at-racing-92-we-do-not-know-more-nakarawa/">still in </a><a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/fiji">Fiji</a> building a house for his family. However, he was not given permission for an extended leave of absence and has now been struck off the Racing playing roster ahead of their Champions Cup campaigns which starts next Sunday at home to defending champions Saracens.</p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://www.racing92.fr//content/uploads/2019/11/CP-Leone-Nakarawa.pdf">brief statement published on the club’s website</a>, Racing said: “Racing 92 have provisionally laid off <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/racing-92/players/leone-nakarawa/">Leone Nakarawa</a> and summoned him to an interview prior to a possible sanction. The club will make no further comments about this decision.”</p>
      <p>The second row – one of the highest earners at Racing – was part of the Fijian side eliminated from the World Cup when beaten by <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/wales">Wales</a> on October 9, but he has since failed to report back for club duty with the Parisians.</p>
      <p>Nakarawa played in all four of his country’s pool matches at the finals in <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/japan">Japan</a> and was expected to pitch up in France for training in the last week of October. However, there has been no sign yet of a player regarded to be one of the best in the world in his position.</p>

      <p>Despite a Pacific Rugby Welfare tweet last week insisting the club knows what Nakarawa is up to in Fiji, the situation has not played out well with the Parisians.</p>
      <p>Prior to last weekend’s Top 14 derby win over Stade Francais, boss Laurent Travers said: “He [Nakarawa] must resume. We have news, yes, the players have had. I think the club too but now, for the moment he is not present at Racing 92. We do not know more.”</p>
      <p>All the French-based players who were with countries eliminated at the end of the pool stages of the World Cup were generally due to be back training with their clubs by Monday, October 28, except in the case of injury.</p>
