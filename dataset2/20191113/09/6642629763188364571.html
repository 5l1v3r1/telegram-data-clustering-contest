      <p><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/japan.html">Japan</a>'s Hayabusa2 spacecraft has departed from a distant asteroid, starting its yearlong journey home after successfully completing its mission to bring back soil samples and data that could provide clues to the origins of the solar system.</p>
      <p>The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency says the spacecraft left its orbit around the asteroid Ryugu, about 300 million kilometresÂ (180 million miles) from Earth.</p>
      <p>Hayabusa2 made two touchdowns on the asteroid and successfully collected data and samples during its one-and-a-half-year mission since arriving there in June 2018.</p>
      <p>The spacecraft is expected to return to Earth in late 2020 and drop a capsule containing the precious samples in the Australian desert.</p>
      <p>JAXA scientists hope the samples contain carbon and organic matter that could explain how they are related to Earth.</p>
