      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/vedanta">Vedanta </a>special economic zone (SEZ) in Odisha has sought governemnt permission to locally procure calcined petroleum coke for its unit to manufacture aluminium ingots and wire rod.</p>
      <p>The request of the company will be considered by the board of approval, the highest decision-making body on SEZs, in its meeting on November 15 here.</p>
      <p>The inter-ministerial board is chaired by the commerce secretary.</p>
      <p>The company has to seek this approval as procuring any material from outside <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sezs">SEZs </a>is treated as imports. <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sezs">SEZs </a>are treated as foreign entities in terms of customs rules.</p>
      <p>Import of petroleum coke used for fuel purpose is prohibited.</p>
      <p>"The unit has requested for permission for local procurement of calcined petroleum coke for their authorised operations. But as per a notification...issued by the commerce ministry, petroleum coke is a prohibited item," according to the agenda paper of the board.</p>
      <p>However, it said that the state pollution control board of Odisha has allowed the SEZ unit to buy this coke from indigenous source.</p>
      <p>The unit requires this coke as one of the raw materials for their authorised operations to manufacture of aluminium ingots, wire rod and billet, it said.</p>
      <p>Vedanta, an SEZ unit in <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/vedanta">Vedanta </a>SEZ was granted letter of approval in April 2009 for manufacture of these products. The unit had commenced production in December 2015.</p>
      <p>According to SEZ rules, supply of restricted items to units in a SEZ from outside these zones can be allowed for setting up infrastructure facility and as a raw material for undertaking manufacturing operation, subject to approval of the board.</p>
      <p>Development Commission of Falta SEZ has recommended the request of Vedanta, SEZ for local procurement of this coke.</p>
      <p>"The request is placed before the board for consideration," it said.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sezs">SEZs </a>are major export hubs in the country as the government provides several incentives and single-window clearance system.</p>
      <p>Exports from these zones stood at over Rs 7 lakh crore in 2018-19.</p>
