      <p><a href="https://www.eitdigital.eu/">EIT Digital</a>, a leading European digital innovation and entrepreneurial education organisation, has just awarded the best 10 deep-tech scale-ups from across the continent. Carefully selected from 279 applications from 33 countries, the winners represent five general categories: Digital Industry, Digital Tech, Digital Wellbeing, Digital Cities, and Digital Finance. The record number of applications received for the competition this year represents a 40 percent increase compared to 2018.</p>
      <p>“This is not your usual competition where just the winners count,” said Chahab Nastar, chief innovation officer at EIT Digital. “The 25 finalists have been carefully selected; they are all winners in the sense that they all have evidence of growth potential. The juries saw tremendous qualities in the 10 companies that came on top. We now welcome them into the EIT Digital Accelerator and will give them dedicated pan European support for customer acquisition and fundraising. We want them to become large dominant companies in their respective markets.”</p>
      <p>The 25 finalists will now enter the <a href="https://www.eitdigital.eu/accelerator">EIT Digital Accelerator</a>, a tailor-made support programme that helps startups and scale-ups secure international customers, raise Series A and B funding, and grow internationally. In addition to that, the first place in each category has received a €50,000 cash prize.</p>
