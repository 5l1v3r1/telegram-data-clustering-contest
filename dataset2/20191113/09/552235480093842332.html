      <h1>Neil Doncaster earns mammoth £91k SPFL bonus as league chief rewarded despite falling revenues</h1>
      <h2>The pay packet boost is a 30 per cent pay hike on the previous year despite revenue dropping by three per cent</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T09:16:36+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 09:16</time> by <a rel="author">Graeme Young, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/graeme-young/</a></address>
      <p>SFPL chief executive <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-doncaster">Neil Doncaster</a> has received a whopping £91,000 performance-related bonus.</p>
      <p>The pay packet boost is a 30 per cent pay hike on the previous year despite revenue dropping by three per cent due to no team being involved in the Champions League group stage.</p>
      <p>His salary of £388,000 is up from the £297,000 he received in 2018 and comes after the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/">SPFL</a> CEO secued the league's £160m five-year TV deal with Sky.</p>
      <p>Doncaster has been hit with criticism over a host of issues in recent years and the SPFL were slammed over their handling of last season's Betfred Cup semi-finals.</p>

      <p>A fixture fiasco erupted after their initial plan to play both showpiece ties at Hampden was kiboshed by the clubs involved with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a> vs <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> being moved to Murrayfield.</p>
      <p>And there is still work to do for the former Norwich City secretary with no league sponsor in place for next season with Ladbrokes ending their involvement as title sponsors.</p>
      <p>But a league source insists the new and improved deal from the broadcast giant reflects well on the 49-year-old.</p>
      <p>A league source told the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7679029/SPFL-clubs-pay-chief-executive-Neil-Doncaster-huge-90-000-BONUS.html">Daily Mail</a> : "The new broadcast contracts delivered just under 20 per cent more revenue to clubs. Crucially it also involves far fewer changes to kick off times, with the disrupted kick-offs down from 60 to 48.</p>
      <p>"Attendances over the last five years have gone from 2013/14 when the figures were 3.8 million to 4.5million now. Per capita that gives Scotland the highest attendances in Europe."</p>
