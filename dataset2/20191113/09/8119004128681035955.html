      <p>Mandabagh Railway Station Master Zakir Hossain initiated the case of ‘unnatural deaths’ on Wednesday, said Akhaura Railway Police OC Shyamol Kanti Das.</p>
      <p>A Chattogram-bound Udayan Express from Sylhet and a Dhaka-bound Turna Nishitha from Chattogram collided at Mondobagh Railway Station in the wee hours of Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Sixteen people were killed and at least 50 others were injured in the calamity.</p>
      <p>The accident snapped Dhaka's rail links with Chattogram and Sylhet for eight hours before two relief trains from Laksam and Akhaura cleared the tracks.</p>
      <p>After the collision, several bogeys of Turna found their way to the top of some Udayan’s carriages while two other coaches were severely twisted.</p>
      <p>The Fire Service and Civil Defence fear that there might be more bodies trapped inside the bogeys.</p>
      <p>The Bangladesh Railway authorities have formed three probe committees, and the railway ministry and the Brahmanbaria district administration also set up a panel each to investigate the crash.</p>
