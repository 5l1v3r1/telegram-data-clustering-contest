      <p>Cape Town - <b>Bafana Bafana</b> coach <b>Molefi Ntseki</b> has been probed whether former striker <b>Benni McCarthy</b> could join his technical team.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Soccer/PSL/cape-town-city-sack-benni-mccarthy-as-head-coach-20191104">42-year-old McCarthy was recently sacked as head coach of Cape Town City</a> following a run of poor results as the Mother City side won just two of their last 18 matches.</p>
      <p>McCarthy has reportedly returned to Scotland to enjoy some quality family time as he ponders his next move, with reports linking the Champions League winner to Soweto giants Orlando Pirates.</p>
      <p><b>South African Football Association (SAFA)</b> president <b>Danny Jordaan</b> also <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Soccer/PSL/safa-president-weighs-in-on-benni-being-sacked-20191106">weighed in on McCarthy's sacking</a>, revealing he will have talks with the coach to discuss a possible role within the association.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Ntseki is hoping to build an overseas-based scouting network in the next few months with a view to roping in McCarthy.</p>
      <p>"Yeah, because when you look at our roll-out plan I presented to the president and technical committee, we need to have a scout overseas," said Ntseki ahead of Bafana Bafana's crucial <b>Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON)</b> qualifier against Ghana on Thursday.</p>
      <p>"Basically we are saying we must have two, who will be helping each other for senior and all the junior players, because if we are to have only one scout then it would be very difficult to be all over and give us a technical report on players we have overseas.</p>
      <p>"So, it's just unfortunate that coach Benni had to lose his job at Cape Town City, but that doesn’t mean anything bad about him - he’s a good coach and a legend of the game, and he’s qualified to do the job for us. When that time comes, we’ll be able to consider him."</p>
