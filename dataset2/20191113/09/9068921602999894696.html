      <p>Apple today <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/13/16-inch-macbook-pro-announced-with-up-to-64gb-of-ram-and-8tb-ssd-new-keyboard-louder-speakers-and-more/">announced and launched</a> the long-awaited 16-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a>, which has now replaced the previous 15-inch ‌MacBook Pro‌ models in the line of Apple notebooks. Alongside the announcement, a handful of YouTubers and tech bloggers have begun sharing their first impressions of the 16-inch ‌MacBook Pro‌, after having used it for a few hours.</p>

      <p>The two big updates to the new notebook include its bigger 16-inch Retina display, and the updated scissor switch keyboard that ditches the butterfly keyboard of the previous 15-inch ‌MacBook Pro‌. Essentially every first impression applauded Apple for the new keyboard, particularly in regards to the new physical Escape key (instead of a virtual one on the Touch Bar). <br/><br/>Below we've rounded up a few first impressions videos for the 16-inch ‌MacBook Pro‌. <br/><br/><b>Marques Brownlee:</b></p>
