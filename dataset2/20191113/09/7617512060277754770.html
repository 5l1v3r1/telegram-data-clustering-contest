      <p>WINNIPEG — The Manitoba government says it is going to review photo radar — a traffic enforcement tool that critics have said is more about money than road safety.</p>
      <p>Infrastructure Minister Ron Schuler says the review is to determine whether the technology is meeting its intended goal of improving road safety.</p>
      <p>"We would like to have someone look at the empirical data to make sure that it is actually doing what it was supposed to do," Schuler said Wednesday.</p>
      <p>He said would not prejudge the outcome.</p>
      <p>Photo radar has been used in many areas of Winnipeg since 2003. There are fixed cameras at a few dozen red-light intersections and mobile cameras are frequently set up in school and construction zones.</p>
      <p>Instead of being pulled over by a police officer, speeders get a ticket in the mail days later with a photograph of their vehicle attached.</p>
      <p>Opponents such as the group Wise Up Winnipeg say the technology has not improved safety, but has served mainly as a money stream for governments. Critics point to mobile cameras that have been set up in school zones on holidays and other days when students are not in class.</p>
      <p>The Progressive Conservative government said it plans to hire an outside firm to do the review, which is to also examine the technology being used. Both the government and police say it has grown old.</p>
      <p>Winnipeg police say they are already convinced of photo radar's benefits and would like to use it more.</p>
      <p>"The consistent drop in offences issued at specific locations shows that it's changing driver behaviour in those locations," said Insp. Gord Spado of the Winnipeg Police Service traffic division.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately, it's not changing driver behaviour through the entire city, which is really our goal — to get away from the speeding culture."</p>
      <p>Provincial law limits photo radar to areas such as construction zones and roads next to schools and playgrounds. Winnipeg police would like to use it along high-speed, multi-lane roads, where there are safety concerns about having a police officer set up, Spado said.</p>
      <p>Alberta's former NDP government released a third-party report last winter that said photo radar generated about $220 million a year in revenue for the province while reducing collisions by about 1.4 per cent. The government deemed photo radar a cash cow and tightened rules on where it could be used.</p>
      <p>Spado said a 1.4 per cent drop is meaningful.</p>
      <p>"If that was right-angle collisions ... and you reduce them by 1.4 per cent, that's huge, because those are the ones that kill people."</p>
