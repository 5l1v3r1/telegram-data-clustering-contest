      <h1>Next in Google's Quest for Consumer Dominance -- Banking</h1>

      <p>Google will soon offer checking accounts to consumers, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/next-in-googles-quest-for-consumer-dominancebanking-11573644601">becoming the latest Silicon Valley heavyweight to push into finance</a>. The Wall Street Journal:<i> The project, code-named Cache, is expected to launch next year with accounts run by Citigroup and a credit union at Stanford University, a tiny lender in Google's backyard. Big tech companies see financial services as a way to get closer to users and glean valuable data. Apple <a href="https://news.slashdot.org/story/19/03/25/1810226/apple-debuts-apple-card-to-transform-the-credit-card-experience">introduced a credit card this summer</a>. Amazon.com has talked to banks about offering checking accounts. Facebook is working on a digital currency it hopes will upend global payments. Their ambitions could challenge incumbent financial-services firms, which fear losing their primacy and customers. They are also likely to stoke a reaction in Washington, where regulators are already investigating whether large technology companies have too much clout.<br/><br/>The tie-ups between banking and technology have sometimes been fraught. Apple irked its credit-card partner, Goldman Sachs Group, by running ads that said the card was "designed by Apple, not a bank." Major financial companies dropped out of Facebook's crypto project after a regulatory backlash. Google's approach seems designed to make allies, rather than enemies, in both camps. The financial institutions' brands, not Google's, will be front-and-center on the accounts, an executive told The Wall Street Journal. And Google will leave the financial plumbing and compliance to the banks -- activities it couldn't do without a license anyway.</i></p>
