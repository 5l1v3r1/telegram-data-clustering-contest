      <p><a href="https://hothardware.com/news/motorola-moto-razr-leaked">Motorola's Moto Razr</a> is almost here folks; and that point is even more evident by the smartphone's appearance at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). As is often the case with unreleased smartphones, these FCC "leaks" often give us a great look at what we can expect when the product begins shipping.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/fcc">FCC</a> images confirm all of the previously leaked renders that we've seen concerning the Moto Razr, including its clamshell design that harks back to the original <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/moto-razr">Moto Razr</a> flip-phone family. We can also see an elongated, unbroken portrait-style display that folds when not in use.</p>

      <p>Additional images from the FCC show the smartphone with its display unfolded from the right and left sides, along with views of the top and bottom of the smartphone. The bottom shot in particular confirms a rather thick "chin" that we would assume holds a portion of the battery along with the visible USB-C port.</p>

      <p>Separately, Motorola has updated its Twitter profile to show a darkened image of the Moto Razer opened from the side. The image looks identical to renders that leaked in late October.</p>

      <p>According to previous leaks, the Moto Razr is expected to feature a 6.2-inch folding display along with an 800x600 cover display. The smartphone is allegedly powered by a <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/qualcomm">Qualcomm</a><a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/snapdragon-710">Snapdragon 710</a> SoC in 4GB/64GB (RAM/storage) or 6GB/128GB configurations. Additionally, it's expected that the Moto Razr will have a 2730 mAh non-removable battery.</p>
      <p>Motorola is expected to fully reveal the Moto Razr later today, and we’ll update this article with the official information at that time.</p>
