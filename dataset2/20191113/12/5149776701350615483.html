      <h1>Nottingham bar showing Christmas films and there's unlimited booze with every ticket</h1>
      <h2>A choice of burgers is also included in the price</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T12:20:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 12:20</time> by <a rel="author">Rachel Gorman</a></address>
      <p>The Yuletide season just got a whole lot merrier with one Nottingham bar screening <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> classics - including Die Hard - accompanied by unlimited booze with every ticket purchased.</p>
      <p>New venue The Wildlife (located above Billy Bootleggers, in High Pavement), is getting its punters into the festive spirit by hosting a trio of <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/film/">movie nights</a>, where two hours of free-flowing beer or fizz and a burger is included in the Â£25 ticket price.</p>
      <p>Kicking off proceedings will be the first two Home Alone movies on December 5, followed by Die Hard on December 12 and Elf on December 19.</p>
      <p>Tickets can be purchased in advance on the bar's official Facebook page. One ticket is needed per person per night and includes two hours of unlimited prosecco or Bud as well as something to (sensibly) line everyone's stomachs.</p>
