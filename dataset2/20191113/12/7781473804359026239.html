      <p>Hyundai Motor India has trimmed the line-up that it offers for the <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/hyundai/grand-i10-m248/">Hyundai Grand i10</a> hatchback. The carmaker didn't discontinue the older Grand i10, when it launched the Hyundai Grand i10 Nios. But now, the firm is only selling the older car in its petrol-manual and CNG iterations.</p>

      <p>Further, these cars are now only available in the mid-spec Magna and Sportz trim. Paint options have been trimmed down to four - Fiery Red, Typhoon Silver, Titan Grey and Polar White. Notable features on the Sportz variant are turn indicators on outer mirrors, rear spoiler, chrome-finished interior trim, a 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Android Auto/Apple CarPlay, electrically folding outer mirrors, cooled glove box and tilt adjustment for the steering wheel.</p>
      <p>The 1.2-litre petrol motor makes 83PS and 114Nm. In the dual-fuel version running on CNG, these drop to 66PS and 98Nm. The CNG version also gets a 60-litre CNG tank. Both versions come with a 5-speed manual.</p>
      <p>Prices for the Hyundai Grand i10 start at Rs 5.81 lakh for petrol Magna variant. <a href="http://overdrive.in/news-cars-auto/2019-hyundai-grand-i10-nios-variants-explained/">The Hyundai Grand i10 Nios, on the other hand, can be had with both petrol and diesel versions</a>, with AMT options on both.</p>
