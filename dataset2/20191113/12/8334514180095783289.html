      <p>The U.S. drugmaker has already reached similar agreements with the National Health Service in Northern Ireland, England and Scotland.</p>
      <p>More than 10,000 people in Britain have cystic fibrosis, a debilitating, life-shortening inherited condition, making it the country with the second highest number of such patients in the world, according to the company.</p>
      <p>Although the terms agreed with the countries have not been disclosed, UK government-run healthcare systems have been negotiating treatment supply with Vertex for years.</p>
      <p>The company had wanted to charge around 100,000 pounds ($129,000) a year for a course of Orkambi, its combination drug that improves lung function, according to reports.</p>
      <p>“This has been a hard-fought four year battle,” said David Ramsden, chief executive officer at UK-based charity the Cystic Fibrosis Trust.</p>
      <p>However, Ramsden noted the company’s new drug, known as Trikafta in the United States, is likely to make a bigger difference for a wider group of cystic fibrosis patients.</p>
      <p>“We must do all we can to ensure there is no repeat of the deadlock and delays in accessing these treatments when they are licensed,” he added.</p>
      <p>Vertex said its agreement with Wales will allow about 270 eligible patients to be treated with Orkambi, as well as its other medicines Symkevi and Kalydeco.</p>
      <p>Shares of the company were marginally higher at $205 in light premarket trading.</p>
