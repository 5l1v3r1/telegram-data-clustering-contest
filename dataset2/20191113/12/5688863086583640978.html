        <b>Australia batsman Ashton Turner has been roped in by Worcestershire for 2020 season of the  Vitality Blast as a foreign signing. Paul Pridgeon, Worcestershire Cricket Steering Group Chairman hailed Turner as a young and promising talent and he hopes that the Aussie would fit into their setup.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Worcestershire, who finished fourth in the 2019 season of the Vitality Blast have roped in Ashton Turner for the 2020 campaign of the tournament. Turner will be joining the North England side as a foreign signing along with Hamish Rutherford, who is the other foreign signing of the team.</p>
      <p>Pridgeon was all praises about the 28-year-old as he hailed him as a young and promising talent while sharing his plan of fielding Turner as a top order batsman as he will be available throughout the campaign.</p>
      <p>"We are very pleased to sign Ashton. He is a promising, young player which fits our profile and hopefully he will fit nicely into our set-up,” Cricbuzz quoted Pridgeon.</p>
      <p>"He is a top order batter, batting four or five at the moment in the Australian T20 side. His stats stack up. We've seen footage of him and have done our homework - he looks a decent player. He is also a terrific fielder which helps, and is important in T20 cricket."</p>
      <p>Turner broke into the Australia national side on the back of 966 Big Bash runs at a strike rate of 141.02 and have played 10 T20Is and three ODIs in baggy green ever since. Turner, who has scored 1166 runs at a strike rate of 136.05 in 71 T20 innings, has made quite some impact in the national side with his long handle.</p>
