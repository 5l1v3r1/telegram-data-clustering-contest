      <p>Geralt of Rivia's adventures continue before his most recent story was ever told. The new<i> Witcher</i> Netflix series lives on despite not having yet debuted.</p>
      <p>Netflix announced this morning that it has renewed <i>The Witcher</i> for a second season. If this sounds counterintuitive, it sort of is. <i>The Witcher</i>'s first season is set to premiere on December 20. </p>
      <p>However, Netflix evidently doesn't need to wait on the general consensus to the eight-episode first season before greenlighting even more. Maybe Netflix already knows that <i>The Witcher</i> is good enough to warrant a second season. Or, as more streaming subscription services like Disney+ continue to pop up, maybe Netflix feels an ever-increasing pressure to keep creating exclusive content. Honestly, it's probably both.</p>
