      <h1>Wanyama, Olunga Arrive In Alex For Kenya, Egypt Clash</h1>

      <p>Tottenham midfielder Victor Wanyama and Japan-based striker Michael Olunga have joined Kenya camp in Alexandria ahead of Thursday’s 2021 AFCON qualifier against Egypt.</p>
      <p>Olunga’s availability for the tie was doubtful after the ministry provided an economy ticket, which the player rejected owing to the long flight from Japan to Cairo.</p>
      <p>It took the intervention of the Football Kenya Federation (FKF), which borrowed about Kshs1.2 million to purchase a business class ticket.</p>

      <p>Olunga has enjoyed a great form for Kashiwa Reysol in the Japanese second division where he has netted 19 times this season.</p>
      <p>Overall, all players initially called up for the match have reported to camp save for Boniface Muchiri and John Avire.</p>
      <p>Muchiri is expected in Egypt on Wednesday while Avire will miss out due to personal commitments.</p>
