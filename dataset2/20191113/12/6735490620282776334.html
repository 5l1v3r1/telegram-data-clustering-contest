      <p>“Doing a functional serial killer for seven years has been challenging,” Schreiber told Colbert. “This is not the kind of thing you should talk about on a late-night TV show but I will. I don’t know why but I will.</p>
      <p>“I told my kids the other day — I was a little hot-tempered with my kids,” he continued. “I said, ‘You know guys, I’m really sorry but I think daddy is bringing home work every once in a while and I owe you guys an apology.’ I was actually impressed with how well they took it.”</p>
