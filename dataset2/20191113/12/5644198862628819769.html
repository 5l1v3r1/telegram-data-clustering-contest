      <p>SAO PAULO: Serving airlines that will operate flights lasting 14 hours or longer is a "key consideration" for Boeing Co's global growth strategy over the next 20 years, an executive said on Tuesday (Nov 12).</p>
      <p>Those flights, sometimes called ultra long-haul, have grabbed headlines in recent weeks as <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/qantas-tests-world-longest-commercial-flight-new-york-to-sydney-12018116">Qantas Airlines tested a 19-hour flight between New York and Sydney</a> using a Boeing 787-9 and prepares to test an even longer flight between Sydney and London with the same plane.</p>

      <p>"Globally, if long haul is growing 5 per cent per year, ultra long-haul is growing twice that per year," Darren Hulst, a managing director at Boeing, told Reuters in Sao Paulo while discussing market forecasts for the next 20 years.</p>
      <p>Commercial aviation overall is expected to grow 4.6 per cent per year on average between 2019 and 2038, according to a Boeing market study released in September, representing a slight slowing from the previous pace of about 5 per cent, according to figures compiled by the World Bank.</p>
      <p>Growth in the ultra long-haul sector highlights changing habits among passengers, who are willing to travel longer. It is also a tribute to the increasing fuel efficiency of aircraft that allow for such routes to be flown profitably.</p>
      <p>But Hulst said this market has developed without Boeing expecting it to, pointing specifically to the carrier's use of the 787-9 plane to fly ever longer trips.</p>
      <p>This plane is now the "key player" for ultra long-haul flights involving midsized wide-body planes.</p>
      <p>"When we designed the airplane, I think the sweet spot for where we saw the airplane operating was between nine and 14 hours," Hulst said.</p>
      <p>Boeing competitor Airbus SE is also targeting the segment above 14 hours with the A350-900ULR, which <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/world-s-longest-sia-flight-departs-singapore-for-new-york-10818070">Singapore Airlines currently uses to fly the roughly 18 hours between Singapore and the New York</a> metro area. That flight is the longest currently in commercial operation.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Airbus also plans to soon launch an Ultra Long Range version of the A350-1000.</p>
      <p>Qantas currently operates a regularly scheduled flight between Perth, Australia and London which is the longest commercial flight using a Boeing 787-9. But that title could change if the carrier decides to operate the Sydney-New York route commercially.</p>
      <p>"This is more capability than we originally thought our customers would use it for," Hulst said.</p>
