      <h2>Row broke out on wedding bus travelling to Renfrewshire</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T12:56:16+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 12:56</time> by <a rel="author">Ron Moore, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/ron-moore/</a></address>
      <p>A tanked-up guest bottled another reveller in the face after trouble flared up on a wedding bus.</p>
      <p>Ross Nisbet, 26, attacked victim Andrew Miller with a glass bottle after they clashed on board a coach travelling to Renfrewshire.</p>
      <p>Paisley Sheriff Court heard Nisbet sat down behind Mr Miller before producing the bottle, which he smashed into his face, leaving him scarred for life.</p>
      <p>Procurator Fiscal depute John Penman told the court Nisbet and Mr Miller got into an argument over seating on the bus travelling back to Johnstone from Bathgate following the wedding.</p>
      <p>He said: “The accused and his partner had been sitting next to witness Mr Miller, who was sitting with his partner.</p>
      <p>“Mr Miller asked the accused to move as both he and his partner were feeling ‘squashed.’</p>
      <p>“The accused apparently refused to move.</p>
      <p>“The witness Mr Miller got up to move to another seat.</p>
      <p>“The witness then approached the accused, and the accused is pushed off of the seat by the complainer.</p>
      <p>“The accused moved to another seat behind the complainer.</p>
      <p>“There was a verbal exchange between them. After about 15 to 20 minutes the accused struck the complainer on the head with a glass bottle.”</p>
      <p>The court heard the attack happened as the bus was pulling into Johnstone railway station in the early hours of November 30 last year.</p>
      <p>A number of eyewitnesses travelling on the bus clocked the assault.</p>
      <p>The prosecutor added: “Mr Miller had his back to the accused. He feels being struck on the head and as he got up he observes the accused standing up pointing at him.”</p>
      <p>Mr Miller was left with blood streaming from wounds in his face.</p>
      <p>He was taken to Paisley’s Royal Alexandra Hospital by ambulance and received stitches to wounds both above and beneath his left eye.</p>
      <p>He also suffered a gash in his left ear and another cut on his cheek.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, Nisbet of Canal Street, Johnstone, admitted a charge of assault to severe injury and permanent disfigurement.</p>
      <p>Defence agent Gordon Nicol said Nisbet acted only after “provocation” from Mr Miller, who had pushed him off the seat causing him to fall onto the passageway in the bus “in front of everyone.”</p>
      <p>He said: “He admits it was a moment of madness when he committed this offence. This will live with him for the rest of his days.</p>
      <p>“It is a significant conviction on his record and he accepts his conduct was unacceptable.”</p>
      <p>Sheriff Craig Harris said: “This is an exceptionally serious offence involving an assault upon another by striking him on the head while he had been sitting down.”</p>
      <p>However, he said he was prepared to deal with the matter by handing Nisbet a punishment as an “alternative to custody” because of his lack of a serious record, and his admission of guilt.</p>
      <p>He handed him 12 months of supervision, ordered him to perform 270 hours of unpaid work and told him to pay £3,000 in compensation to the victim.</p>
