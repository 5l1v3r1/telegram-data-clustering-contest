      <p>BigBread's <i><a href="https://bigbread.itch.io/no-destination">No Destination</a></i> is a "game" in the classic spirit of <i>Desert Bus</i>, and you don't even have to make the occasional steering adjustment. Just sit and enjoy the journey, looking out of a train coach at the procedurally-generated hills and woods of wherever it is you are.</p>
      <p>It's just the first entry I've checked out from from the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/procjam/entries">2019 ProcJam </a>-- "Make something that makes something" -- and there are dozens more experiments, artworks and according-to-Hoyle games to enjoy.</p>
