      <p>MUMBAI: Chief national <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Badminton">badminton</a> coach <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Pullela-Gopichand">Pullela Gopichand</a> on Wednesday said the reason he continues to coach is that the players need him and there is still no succession plan in place.</p>
      <p>"Well, to be honest, the reason why I continue to coach and I am obsessed about it is also because I haven't had...I don't see the succession plan come by so easily, it is been tough," said Gopichand.</p>
      <p>"I wish, now... to be honest, I feel it like a burden and a responsibility, I can't let go the kind of (performance) we have achieved and the players need me and that becomes a burden internally."</p>
      <p>He was addressing a seminar 'EDGE 20190 on the theme 'The Power of One' organised by <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/EdelGive-Foundation">EdelGive Foundation</a>. Gopichand has produced Olympic medallists including <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/saina-nehwal">Saina Nehwal</a> and PV Sindhu. .</p>
      <p>"So in the last few years, I was silently talking to people, in the last few months I have been talking to the press a little loudly about the need for coach education, need for coaches to be empowered and a system to be in place. It is my selfish desire to rest and relax," he added.</p>
      <p>The image of a "calm and composed" Gopichand sitting courtside during matches is quite familiar and he revealed that he never intends to put additional pressure on shuttlers when they are already under pressure.</p>
      <p>"When I am sitting behind the player, I consciously think that my pressure should not add to the player's pressure, he is already in a pressure cooker, so you don't want to add a little more to that pressure," he said.</p>
      <p>Saying that winning and losing was part of the game, Gopichand said it was important to maintain equilibrium when it comes to displaying emotions. "So in a tournament, I am sitting down and I have 10 kids playing and six of them have lost on day one, three of them have lost on day 2, so if I start feeling bad and miserable each time they lost or feel excited each time they win, then it is not very healthy for me.</p>
      <p>"It is important for me over the years to realize that winning and losing keeps happening and it doesn't matter and it is part of your job (as a coach). If you get too elated when you win, you will very feel lousy when you lose, just to control it and keep that equilibrium, is something important," he stressed.</p>
