      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T12:07:06+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 12:07</time> by <a rel="author">Bradley Jolly, Barnaby Kellaway, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/bradley-jolly/</a></address>
      <p>A mum described as a "fussy eater" who was "concerned about her weight" died after months of self-neglect, an <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/inquests">inquest</a> heard yesterday.</p>
      <p>Michelle Dunn, 48, collapsed at her home and was rushed to hospital where doctors found she had chronic malnutrition.</p>
      <p>She was diagnosed with suspected <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/health/what-sepsis-signs-symptoms-treatment-7246541">sepsis</a> and an upper gastrointestinal bleed, which can result in significant blood loss over a short period.</p>
      <p>But the mother-of-two's condition deteriorated rapidly and the decision was made to put her on end-of-life care at St James's University Hospital in Leeds, West Yorkshire.</p>
      <p>She died there on November 2.</p>
      <p>Wakefield Coroner's Court heard yesterday Michelle was previously admitted to hospital for malnutrition in July this year, when her condition was so severe she was unable to even walk.</p>

      <p>Kevin McLoughlin, senior coroner for West Yorkshire, recorded a conclusion of malnutrition and self-neglect.</p>
      <p>"Michelle was admitted to hospital with suspected sepsis and upper gastrointestinal bleed.</p>
      <p>"Her condition was attributable to chronic malnutrition. After discussion she was provided with end of life care until her death on Saturday, November 2," the coroner said.</p>

      <p>But family told the inquest Michelle, of Leeds, was a "fussy eater".</p>
      <p>A fall, though, also contributed to her decline in health.</p>

      <p>The mum had only recently regained contact with her children after quite a few years apart as a result of a "fracture in the family".</p>
      <p>But Mr McLoughlin added: "Her sons visited her each week. She appeared to be putting on some weight.</p>
      <p>"On the 26th of October a carer found her at her home following a fall and due to her severe frailty an ambulance was called."</p>
      <p>Her son Luke has set up an online <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/michelledunn">crowdfunding page</a> to help raise money for his mum's funeral.</p>
