      <h1>Verizon is giving away Android TV boxes to home 5G subscribers</h1>
      <h2>The Stream TV is aimed at users who've ditched conventional TV.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T12:47:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 12:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.facebook.com/jonathanf" target="_blank">Jon Fingas</a></address>
      <p>You probably didn't notice it, but Verizon (Engadget's parent company) has a dedicated media player of its own. The carrier quietly <a href="https://www.verizonwireless.com/products/verizon-stream-tv/">released</a> a Stream TV device meant to court <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/15/verizon-5g-home-availability-same-as-mobile/">5G Home</a> subscribers who've figuratively and literally cut the television cord. It's really a straightforward Android TV device with support for 4K video, Chromecast streaming and a Google Assistant-capable voice remote. Naturally, Verizon is hoping that you'll use this to take advantage of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-22-verizon-disney-plus-12-months-free.html">Disney+ deal</a>, tack YouTube TV on to your bill or stream with one of Yahoo's apps.</p>
      <p>Really, the pricing is the hook. The Stream TV costs $70 by itself, but is included with 5G Home service. The stand-alone option isn't the affordable way to stream 4K in any form (Amazon's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/10/03/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k/">Fire TV Stick 4K</a> costs $50), but it's hard to object to receiving one with your internet access -- you can take advantage of that fixed wireless without having to shop for extra hardware. Just don't expect this hardware to be an absolute media powerhouse.</p>
