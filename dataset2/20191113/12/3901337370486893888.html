      <p>Speaking in an exclusive interview with Soccer Laduma this week, Lebusa, who’s in his second season with Sundowns, maintains that Chiefs are not their biggest challengers for the league title this season. </p>
      <p>“The biggest? I don’t think so, man. We run our own race and they also run their own race. We are just focusing on ourselves. If they want to go all the way with us, they can try. I mean, we’ve been doing this for how long now? Even in the season before I came, Sundowns had been doing this. I just came in and added to what they had been doing. As time goes, we will see where they end up, but we know what we want at the end of the season and nothing is going to stop us,” Lebusa said.</p>
