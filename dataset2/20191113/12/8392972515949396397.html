      <p>The Carters were visiting the hospital last night to get a diagnosis for their son, Ollie.</p>
      <p>For months, Mick and Linda have been concerned that their youngest has autism.</p>
      <p>After Ollie had his assessment, Dr Fremantle told the Carters that he demonstrated good attention to detail and carried out most of the tasks she had set him with a high degree of accuracy.</p>

      <p>However, she also said taking into account the outcome of the assessment, the information Mick and Linda have given, and the findings from the school's observations, they have concluded Ollie has Autism Spectrum Disorder but is at the milder end.</p>
      <p>Mick and Linda were stunned by the news.</p>
