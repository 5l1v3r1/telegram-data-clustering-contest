      <h1>IPL 2020 trade window: who are the teams likely to release?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T12:18:12+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 12:18</time> by <a rel="author">Gaurav Sundararaman</a></address>
      <p>
        <i>November 14 is the deadline set by the IPL Governing Council for franchises to submit their final list of retained and released players. The trade window will also close on the same day. ESPNcricinfo looks at some of the players different franchises might want to release for one reason or other, including enhancing their purses before the IPL 2020 auction on December 19.</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>Note:</b> the remaining purse is the balance left after the 2019 IPL auction. Each franchise will have an additional INR 3 crore added at the forthcoming auction.</p>
      <h3>Mumbai Indians</h3>
      <p>
        <i>Remaining purse - INR 3.05 crore</i>
      </p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/australia/content/player/272477.html">Jason Behrendorff</a> (INR 1 crore)</b><br/>A <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/27795367/behrendorff-opts-same-lower-spine-surgery-pattinson">lower spine</a> injury earlier this year has forced Beherendoff to miss six-plus months of cricket, and he is therefore unlikely to take part in the IPL.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/australia/content/player/230371.html">Ben Cutting</a> (INR 2.2 crore)</b><br/>Having acquired the services of Sherfane Rutherford <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/27292950/mumbai-indians-rope-sherfane-rutherford-trade-mayank-markande-delhi-capitals">from Delhi Capitals</a>, Mumbai Indians now possess three overseas medium-pace-bowling allrounders in Kieron Pollard, Rutherford and Cutting. With the possibility of only one of them usually playing in the XI, they could look for an overseas player who has a different skill set.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/southafrica/content/player/379927.html">Beuran Hendricks</a> (INR 50 lakh)</b><br/>The South African was a replacement for West Indies fast bowler Alzarri Joseph, who clocked the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8048/report/1178394/sunrisers-hyderabad-vs-mumbai-indians-19th-match-indian-premier-league-2019">best-ever bowling figures in the IPL</a> in his debut season last IPL, but had to immediately check out of the tournament because of an injury. It is understood that Joseph is likely to be retained, which will mean Hendricks will be released.</p>
      <h3>Chennai Super Kings</h3>
      <p>
        <i>Remaining purse - INR 3.2 crore</i>
      </p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/player/537119.html">Mohit Sharma</a> (INR 5 crore)</b><br/>Sharma played just one game for Super Kings last season and has not played any form of cricket since then. Like Mumbai, the Super Kings believe in being loyal to their players, but he is an expensive option to retain in case he is not going to be a regular. Importantly, the money can help the franchise look for a younger alternative.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/player/308251.html">David Willey</a> (INR 2 crore)</b><br/>He missed out on the IPL last season and failed to make the England squad for the World Cup, and Super Kings might well look beyond him. With South Africa fast man Lungi Ngidi back this season, they could look at other overseas bowling allrounders as potential replacements.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/newzealand/content/player/539548.html">Scott Kuggeleijn</a> (INR 50 lakh)</b><br/>He joined as a <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/26397235/scott-kuggeleijn-slots-injured-lungi-ngidi-super-kings">replacement player</a> for Ngidi last season, but Kuggeleijn played just two matches. He has not played consistently for New Zealand recently, and returned below-par numbers against England during their home T20I series in November.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/player/297628.html">Sam Billings</a> (INR 1 crore)</b><br/>The Englishman played just one match last season, and found it hard to get a game despite offering a wicketkeeping alternative, given that MS Dhoni was around.</p>

      <h3>Royal Challengers Bangalore</h3>
      <p>
        <i>Remaining purse - INR 1.8 crore</i>
      </p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/australia/content/player/325012.html">Marcus Stoinis</a> (INR 6.2 crore)</b><br/>They have <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/27444528/gary-kirsten-ashish-nehra-mike-hesson-simon-katich-in">overhauled the coaching set-up</a>, and Royal Challengers desperately need to free up the bench to have a good purse at the auction. Stoinis was traded from Kings XI Punjab before last season, but the Australian allrounder didn't make much of an impact.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/newzealand/content/player/55395.html">Colin De Grandhomme</a> (INR 2.2 crore)</b><br/>Another allrounder who has been less effective in the IPL. The New Zealander played just four games last season. In the IPL, de Grandhomme averages just 19 with the bat, though he has a strike rate 134.66. But that is still a long way below his career strike rate of 162.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/westindies/content/player/670025.html">Shimron Hetmyer</a> (INR 4.2 crore)</b><br/>The Guyana left-hander has had a pretty disappointing 2019 in white-ball cricket. He made his IPL debut last season, but a combination of poor returns and limited opportunities meant he couldn't create too many ripples. There is a possibility that Royal Challengers will release Hetmyer and think of buying him back at a lower price.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/southafrica/content/player/436757.html">Heinrich Klaasen</a> (INR 50 lakh)</b><br/>Klaasen failed to impress in the limited chances he has got, but despite a low price, the franchise might want to cut out excess baggage.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/newzealand/content/player/232364.html">Tim Southee</a> (INR 1 crore)</b><br/>Despite being one of the most experienced players around, Southee has just nine wickets from 14 matches at an economy rate of 9.89 and an average of 52.77 in the last three seasons. With Dale Steyn and Nathan Coulter-Nile likely to be retained, Royal Challengers might not need Southee.</p>
      <h3>Sunrisers Hyderabad</h3>
      <p>
        <i>Remaining purse - INR 5.3 crore</i>
      </p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/newzealand/content/player/226492.html">Martin Guptill</a> (INR 1 crore)</b><br/>With David Warner and Jonny Bairstow available for the full season, the chances of Guptill getting a game are bleak. Also, his form in India has never been as dominant as elsewhere, which means <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/27213530/trevor-bayliss-signs-sunisers-hyderabad-head-coach">new head coach Trevor Bayliss</a> might want to look at younger and cheaper options.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/bangladesh/content/player/56143.html">Shakib Al Hasan</a> (INR 2 crore)</b><br/>Shakib will not take part in this year's competition after being <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/27955337/shakib-al-hasan-banned-all-cricket-failing-report-bookie-approach">banned from all cricket</a>.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/player/32498.html">Yusuf Pathan</a> (INR 1.9 crore)</b><br/>At 36 years of age, Yusuf might find it hard to prove his worth. Over the last couple of years, his hitting ability has gone down drastically, and he is not the swiftest of fielders either. He is another player who could find himself on the sidelines, with the franchise going for younger players.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>Kolkata Knight Riders</h3>
      <p>
        <i>Remaining purse - INR 6.05 crore</i>
      </p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/player/35582.html">Robin Uthappa</a> (INR 6.4 crore)</b><br/>The 2014 Orange Cap winner has been in poor form in the ongoing domestic season. Uthappa has scored only 140 runs from ten white-ball matches this season across formats, and he also struggled for Knight Riders last season, failing to get anywhere close to his usual standards.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/player/1070188.html">Kamlesh Nagarkoti</a> (INR 3.2 crore)</b><br/>Nagarkoti was picked at the 2018 auction after his potential to bowl raw pace became evident at the Under-19 World Cup. However, injuries have prevented him from playing even a single match over the last two IPLs. He has not played any domestic cricket yet either. Will Knight Riders risk him again, at such a high price too?</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/westindies/content/player/457249.html">Carlos Brathwaite</a> (INR 5 crore)</b><br/>Ever since the 2016 World T20 final, expectations have been high when it comes to Brathwaite. He has, however, blown hot and cold, and was even dropped by West Indies and lost the T20I captaincy.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/player/12454.html">Joe Denly</a> (INR 1 crore)</b><br/>Injured and now more focused on his Test spot, Denly's IPL record could well end with being dismissed off the only ball he has ever faced in the competition.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/australia/content/player/326637.html">Chris Lynn</a> (INR 9.6 crore)</b><br/>Has he justified his price over the last two seasons? Probably not, but that's the question Knight Riders will ask, and try to answer, when it comes to the Australian opener. There is always an option of buying him back at a lower price.</p>
      <h3>Delhi Capitals</h3>
      <p>
        <i>Remaining purse - INR 8.2 crore</i>
      </p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/player/31107.html">Amit Mishra</a> (INR 4 crore)</b><br/>Having traded in <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/28028554/kings-xi-punjab-trade-r-ashwin-delhi-capitals">R Ashwin from Kings XI</a>, Capitals could well feel Mishra is surplus to their requirements. What will not help is that the 36-year-old's numbers this domestic season have been underwhelming. Capitals are likely to take a long, hard look before figuring out what to do with the veteran legspinner.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/southafrica/content/player/439952.html">Chris Morris</a> (INR 11 crore)</b><br/>Ever since he was injured two season ago, the South African allrounder has not had the impact he did earlier, with bat or ball. A gun death bowler with incredible finishing abilities, Morris was the second player retained by Capitals ahead of the 2018 auction. However, his performance has tapered off since then, and the team could free up the money to buy more effective death bowlers.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/southafrica/content/player/45705.html">Colin Ingram</a> (INR 6.4 crore)</b><br/>T20 globetrotter Ingram had an average IPL last year, and is not getting any younger. The franchise could look at buying him back for a much lower price, or just release him.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/player/452044.html">Hanuma Vihari</a> (INR 2 crore) and <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/player/423838.html">Rahul Tewatia</a> (INR 3 crore)</b><br/>Both of them will find it hard to be part of the playing XI, and could either be traded or released altogether.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>Kings XI Punjab</h3>
      <p>
        <i>Remaining purse - INR 3.7 crore</i>
      </p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/player/1108375.html">Varun Chakravarthy</a> (INR 8.4 crore)</b><br/>He picked up an injury and played just one game last year. Moreover, Chakravarthy has not played any competitive cricket since then. His mystery spin continues to remain a mystery, and Kings XI may not want to wait to find out what it is.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/player/1161024.html">Simran Singh</a> (INR 4.8 crore)</b><br/>The 19-year-old wicketkeeper-batsman from Punjab was bought for a big sum. He has not set the domestic scene on fire though, and his price is way too high for a cricketer who will barely get a game.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/australia/content/player/459508.html">Andrew Tye</a> (INR 7.2 crore)</b><br/>Once the go-to bowler, especially at death, for whichever team he played for, Tye lost his mojo and recently suffered an injury that will put him out for a few months.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/player/662973.html">Sam Curran</a> (INR 7.2 crore)</b><br/>He did shake a leg with Preity Zinta, one of Kings XI's co-owners, but the Englishman failed to be the game-changer that he was meant to be, although he did have a memorable hat-trick when Kings XI pulled off <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8048/scorecard/1175368/kings-xi-punjab-vs-delhi-capitals-13th-match-indian-premier-league-2019">a heist</a> against Capitals. However, Curran remains a candidate who could be put back on the auction block.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/southafrica/content/player/375126.html">Hardus Viljoen</a> (INR 75 lakh) and <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/australia/content/player/5961.html">Moises Henriques</a> (INR 1.5 crore)</b><br/>Neither proved to be terribly effective in the opportunities given, and that could mean the franchise might want to look at other available options.</p>
      <h3>Rajasthan Royals</h3>
      <p>
        <i>Remaining purse - INR 7.15 crore</i>
      </p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/player/390484.html">Jaydev Unadkat</a> (INR 8.4 crore)</b><br/>Despite being among the most expensive buys in the last two auctions, Unadkat has struggled to live up to expectations, including his own. The franchise is likely to think of buying him back for a lower price or letting him go altogether.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/newzealand/content/player/559066.html">Ish Sodhi</a> (INR 50 lakh)</b><br/>To play an overseas wristspinner in the XI is extremely tough, especially when you have Steven Smith, Ben Stokes, Jofra Archer, Jos Buttler and Shreyas Gopal around. Therefore, Royals might be better off buying someone else.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/westindies/content/player/914567.html">Oshane Thomas</a> (INR 1.1 crore)</b><br/>Out of the West Indies squad because of his inconsistent performances, Thomas might not remain the team's No. 1 pick when it comes to to picking among the support acts for Archer.</p>
