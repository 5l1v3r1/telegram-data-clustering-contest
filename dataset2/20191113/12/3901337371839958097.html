      <p>Chiefs have Khama Billiat away with Zimbabwe, Lazarous Kambole as part of the Zambian national team, Daniel Akpeyi with Nigeria, and both Erick Mathoho and Lebogang Manyama in Ghana to face the Black Stars on Thursday evening in Bafana’s 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier.</p>
      <p>The Glamour Boys also saw two of their young players, Siyabonga Ngezana and Happy Mashiane, make the trip to Egypt for the U23 Africa Cup of Nations, with Mashiane starting the 0-0 draw with Zambia over the weekend.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, MultiChoice Diski Challenge coach, Arthur Zwane, and club analyst, Vaughan Coetzee, were brought into Molefi Ntseki’s Bafana setup to prepare for the Ghana game, and Siya sources have revealed that they have now also roped in Chiefs’ Head of Scouting, Walter Steenbok.</p>
      <p>According to Siya sources, the South African Football Association approached the experienced scout to come on board as Opponent Analyst on a part-time basis for this camp, eager for him to watch Sudan v Sao Tome e Principe in order to report back ahead of Bafana’s game against the Sudanese on November 17.</p>

      <p>Steenbok is thought to have left Mzansi’s shores this week ahead of tomorrow’s game, after which he will return to brief Molefe on their next opponents. </p>
