      <p>New Delhi - West Indies batsman <b>Nicholas Pooran</b> has been banned for four T20 internationals for tampering with the ball in a one-day match against Afghanistan, cricket's world body announced Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Pooran admitted to "changing the condition of the ball" after video footage showed him scratching the surface of the white ball with his thumbnail in Lucknow on Monday.</p>
      <p>"He will now miss the next four T20I games for the West Indies and will have five demerit points added to his record," said an International Cricket Council statement.</p>
      <p>Pooran said that he wanted to "issue a sincere apology to my teammates, supporters and the Afghanistan team for what transpired on the field of play on Monday in Lucknow".</p>
      <p>"I recognise that I made an extreme error in judgement and I fully accept the ICC penalty," he added.</p>
      <p>"I want to assure everyone that this is an isolated incident and it will not be repeated. I promise to learn from this and come back stronger and wiser."</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old will be forced to sit out the team's three T20 matches against Afghanistan and the first game of their subsequent three-match series against India.</p>
      <p>Pooran, who made 21 in a successful West Indies chase of 250 that led to a sweep of the three-match ODI series, is a left-handed wicketkeeper batsman.</p>
      <p>He was the man of the match in the second ODI for smashing 67 off 50 balls.</p>
      <p>Born in Trinidad, Pooran has played 16 ODI matches since his 50-over debut earlier this year. He has represented West Indies in 14 T20 games.</p>
