      <p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-jersey">New Jersey</a> country club being sued after a waiter allegedly spilled red wine on a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/odd-news">$30,000 Hermes handbag</a> thinks the pricey accessory is a phony, according to their lawyer.</p>
      <p>“There are serious issues regarding the authenticity of the bag,” said attorney Ken Merber, who represents Alpine Country Club in the lawsuit by purse-owner and member Maryana Beyder.</p>
      <p>Merber added that the club had the pink Kelly bag “examined by an expert,” but declined to say more on the matter.</p>

      <p>“She would not be suing for the value of the bag if the bag wasn’t authentic,” Alexandra Errico said. “We have an authentication report, two of them.”</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, the club decided not to try and hold the slippery-fingered waiter liable for the flub — filing new court papers Tuesday that no longer target the server, according to Errico.</p>
