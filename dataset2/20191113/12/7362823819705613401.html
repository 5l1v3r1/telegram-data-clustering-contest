      <h1>Gregg Jarrett on impeachment hearings: Presumption of Ukraine quid pro quo is 'junk,' not evidence</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T12:02:48+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 12:02</time> by <a rel="author">Julia Musto</a></address>
      <p>The presumption of a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-allies-push-back-on-quid-pro-quo-say-envoy-testified-ukraine-initially-unaware-of-aid-hold-up">quid pro quo</a> is junk and not evidence that would hold up in court, Fox News legal analyst <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/person/j/gregg-jarrett">Gregg Jarrett</a> said Wednesday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/house-of-representatives/democrats">House Democrats</a> are set to hold the first public hearing involving the potential <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry">impeachment</a> of a president since November 19, 1998.</p>
      <p>"It’s a sad day," <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/nancy-pelosi">House Speaker Nancy Pelosi</a>, D-Calif, told Fox News on Tuesday. "A calm day. A prayerful day." For his part, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/adam-schiff">House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff</a>, D-Calif., called the hearings a "solemn undertaking" in a letter to colleagues.</p>

      <p>The first witnesses chosen are Ambassador <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bill-taylor-testimony-bolton-thought-trump-zelensky-call-would-be-disaster">Bill Taylor</a> and career Foreign Service officer <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/state-dept-official-admits-to-impeachment-investigators-he-lacks-direct-knowledge-of-any-quid-pro-quo">George Kent</a> -- both of whom have already testified behind closed doors. In addition, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/marie-yovanovitch-ukraine-emails-house-democrat-staffer-delicate-issue">Marie Yovanovitch</a> is set to testify Friday.</p>
      <p>Aside from witnesses, there will also be exhibits -- lots and lots of exhibits. Democrats, at least, are expected to display excerpts from transcripts, text messages, relevant news articles, and social media posts.</p>

      <p>Appearing on a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/media/fox-news-flash">"Fox &amp; Friends"</a> panel of legal experts, Jarrett told host Brian Kilmeade that the problem with the witnesses who are set to testify is "they're offering their opinions and speculation based on hearsay."</p>
      <p>"I'll give you just one example: George Kent," said Jarrett. " He got it from Bill Taylor who got it from [White House adviser Tim] Morrison, who got it from [US ambassador to the EU Gordon] Sondland. Where did Sondland get it? He testified he just presumed there was a quid pro quo."</p>
      <p>"That's not evidence, that's junk," he said.</p>

      <p>Former U.S. Attorney for Utah Brett Tolman added that, as a lawyer, what you want is substantive fact.</p>

      <p>"You've got to have direct evidence to convict someone, especially in the court of public opinion," he said.</p>
      <p>Former federal prosecutor Robert Ray noted: "The Democrats seem to think that this is an impeachment of an administration."</p>
      <p>"They don't even know the president -- didn't talk to him about. So, how can they imagine or speculate his intent?" Jarrett asked.</p>
      <p>"The president has every right if he has reason to believe that a corrupt act was committed by a public official, to ask the foreign government for that information. Isn't that what Americans would want to know? Of course," he said.</p>
