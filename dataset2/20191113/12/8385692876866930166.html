      <p>Walmart is currently <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">selling</a> the Acer Chromebook 14 for just $179.</p>
      <p>Shaving $120 off of the regular price of the Acer Chromebook 14, and that also brings it down to the lowest price ever.</p>
      <p>The Acer Chromebook 14 has a 14-inch screen, as the name of the Chromebook says. It also is powered by an Intel Atom x5-E800 chipset, with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage.</p>

      <p>That is obviously not a super powerful machine, but for Chrome OS, that is plenty of power. Remember that with Chrome OS, it is really just running a browser, instead of an entire operating system. So it doesn't need the best chipset and the most RAM available. It can make do with a much less powerful set of specs. Which is the case here.</p>
      <p>Walmart is also including a protective sleeve with the Acer Chromebook 14, making this an even sweeter deal for most people. As they'll be able keep their Chromebook nice and safe, from out of the box.</p>
      <p>With the Acer Chromebook 14 you're going to be able to get on the internet pretty quickly. It's really meant for those that only use their laptop for the internet, seeing as this is a Chromebook. While it is pretty great, it's not going to be able to do things like Photoshop or Lightroom. Though, Adobe does have its Android apps available on Chrome OS. And they are decent, but much different from the desktop Photoshop or Lightroom experience. There are also some other great Android apps available for Chrome OS, in fact all of the ones on your phone work on Chrome OS. That includes Twitter, Facebook, Gmail and much more.</p>
