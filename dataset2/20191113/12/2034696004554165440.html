      <p>Speaking on Australian radio breakfast show, Nova 96.6 – Fitzy and Wippa, Martin told host Ryan “Fitzy” Fitzgerald confirmed that Coldplay wouldn’t be playing next year’s festival.</p>
      <p>Martin said: “We won’t be playing at Glastonbury 50 – although, I’ll probably be there because I love going – it’s like our home…but we won’t be playing.”</p>
      <p>When asked about who he would like to see play at Glastonbury, Martin said: “I don’t know. The great thing about Glastonbury is it’s always a bit unpredictable…and that’s a great thing.”</p>
