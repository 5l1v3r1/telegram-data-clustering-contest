      <p>No less than <b>400,000 jobs</b> have been created in different segments of the agricultural value chain by the Nigerian Incentive-Based Risk Sharing System for Agricultural Lending (NIRSAL).</p>
      <p><b>The Details</b>: This feat was made possible via the provision of N101 billion by banks, according to reports from The <a href="https://thenationonlineng.net/nirsal-creates-400000-jobs-in-agric-value-chain/">Nation</a>.</p>

      <p><b>Reacting to the development,</b> Programme Director, National Project Management Conference, Mr Taopheek Babayeju, explained the importance of agriculture.</p>
      <p>He said, <i>“Agriculture is a tool that the developed nations and successful organisations used to achieve developmental and business results</i>.”</p>
      <p><b>He also noted that the decision</b> to depend on Agriculture would not come except it is desired and followed through.</p>
      <p>“<i>The change that we desire as a nation will not come from government but from ordinary people by doing our own little bit to bring about the change we want to see</i>.”</p>
      <p><b>In a recent Nairametrics report</b>, NIRSAL unveiled its new <a href="https://nairametrics.com/2019/02/01/cbns-nirsal-unveils-new-national-microfinance-bank/">national Microfinance Bank</a> (MFB) in February 2019.</p>
