      <h3>NORTHPORT pressed hard its playoff bid as it bounced back from back-to-back setbacks and demolished one of the hottest teams in the PBA Governors’ Cup on Wednesday.</h3>
      <p>The Batang Pier drew steady fires from Michael Qualls, Christian Standhardinger, and Sean Anthony as they caught NLEX in its offnight with a 102-94 win at the Smart Araneta Coliseum.</p>
      <p>Qualls finished with 36 points, 11 rebounds and five assists,  Standhardinger chipped in 23 points and  19 rebounds while Anthony added 19 points and seven rebounds as the Batang Pier stopped the Road Warriors’ 5-game winning rampage that started last October 5 in Dubai.</p>
      <p>The Batang Pier moved up to number 8 with their fourth win in 10 games, but need to hurdle Barangay Ginebra on Nov. 17 for a possible spot in the 8-team quarterfinal phase.</p>
      <p>Harris finished with 34 points and eight rebounds, Kiefer Ravena added 16 points and four assists while Quiñahan banged away 10 markers for the Road Warriors.</p>
      <p>The Road Warriors, who had gone undefeated since beating the Gin Kings in Dubai, nonetheless remained on top of the heap despite absorbing their second loss in 10 outings.</p>
      <p>The Road Warriors though have strong chances of finishing either top 1 or top 2 if they beat Alaska at the close of the elimination round on Nov. 20.</p>
      <p>The top four of the eight teams that will advance to the quarterfinals carry twice-to-beat advantage next round.</p>
      <p>The game was still close early in the fourth, with Harris’ basket putting NLEX within 81-83, before Qualls drove in and made a floater to ignite a brief but telling NorthPort run.</p>
      <p>Nico Elorde then followed suit with a basket of his own, before Standhardinger scored back-to-back baskets as NorthPort posted a 91-83 lead which it gamely protected en route to the victory.</p>
      <p>Harris already had 22 points in the first half. His three-point play with 3:35 left in the second period gave NLEX a 47-36 lead.</p>
      <p>It was Qualls and Standhardinger who carried NorthPort’s offensive the entire first half, tallying 18 and 13 points, respectively.</p>
      <p>The scores:</p>
      <p>NorthPort (102) - Qualls 36, Standhardinger 23, Anthony 19, Ferrer 9, Elorde 7, Taha 4, Lanete 2, Mercado 2, King 0, Escoto 0.</p>
      <p>NLEX (94) - Harris 34, Ravena 16, Quinahan 10, Erram 7, Cruz 7, Fonacier 6, Miranda 5, Paniamogan 4, Taulava 3, Soyud 2, Alas 0, Ighalo 0.</p>
      <p>Quarterscores: 25-28, 43-51, 81-78, 102-94.</p>
