      <h2>British Airways and the British Red Cross have partnered up as the airline looks to fund various aspect of the charity's work</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T12:11:47+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 12:11</time> by <a rel="author">Julie Delahaye, https://www.facebook.com/juliedjourno</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/british-airways">British Airways</a> and the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/red-cross">British Red Cross</a> have announced a brand new partnership for 2019 and 2020, which will see them work together to support communities in crisis.</p>
      <p>The airline and charity revealed on World Kindness Day that they will be working together over the next year, with British Airways set to invest funds across various aspects of the charity's work.</p>
      <p>The British Red Cross helps people in crisis (for example because of a house fire or flood), giving them support to cope and recover with centres that offer food, emergency shelter, essentials and emotional support.</p>
      <p>As part of the new venture, British Airways has said it will invest funds to help the charity continue to recruit, train and support both staff and volunteers.</p>

      <p>British Airways employees will also be encouraged to undertake their own acts of kindness to help those in need including signing up to become a British Red Cross volunteer.</p>
      <p>Other ventures will include offering support to the British Red Cross family reunification programme, which provides a safe and legal way for refugee families who have been torn apart to be reunited.</p>

      <p>To understand just what training is required to provide aid of this nature, a number of British Airways staff visited a crisis simulation event in Cardiff where volunteers gathered to prepare for a real-life fire incident.</p>
      <p>You can find out more about the partnership on the <a href="https://www.redcross.org.uk/british-airways">British Red Cross website</a>.</p>

      <p>Simon Lewis, Head of UK Crisis Response from the British Red Cross said: "We respond to a UK emergency every four hours and through this partnership we can continue to help support people in the UK and around the world if crisis strikes.</p>
      <p>"From supporting our projects such as our national network of community reserve volunteers, who can be called upon to help in a crisis in their community, and getting British Airways staff involved in volunteering and other opportunities, weâ€™ve got lots planned together in the coming months."</p>
