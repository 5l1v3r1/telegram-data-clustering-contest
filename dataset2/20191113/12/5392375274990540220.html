      <p><a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/Huawei">Huawei’s</a> sub-brand Honor is gearing up to unveil a new smartphone on November 26. It will carry the Honor V30 moniker, and according to rumors, will be Honor’s last flagship of 2019. A couple of official teasers confirmed that this device is coming with dual-selfie cameras. Now, Honor has just published two short video clips that reveal the triple-camera array that is placed on the device’s back.</p>
      <p>Along with the Triple-Camera setup, the company is also teasing the 5G connectivity. We can spot the triple camera array at 0:03 mark in the video below. Interestingly enough, the back of a phone bears a triple camera setup which is accompanied by LED flash. If you’re familiar with the Samsung Galaxy M30s, then you’ll probably notice the similarity.</p>

      <p>This teaser is further enriched which might be the Honor Watch Magic 2. If you check the 0:06 mark, there’s a smartwatch which should be Honor’s highly anticipated Magic 2. In counterpart to the first video, the second clip doesn’t reveal much about the smartphone. However, we can clearly see the 5G references through this abstract video.</p>

      <p>Rumors further indicate that Honor will also reveal an Honor V30 Pro on November 26. Unlike its standard sibling, the Pro variant should come with a Quad-Camera setup. Since we’re still two weeks from the announcement, more leaks should keep coming in the coming days.</p>
