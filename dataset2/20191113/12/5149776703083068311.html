      <h1>Residents must wait another two weeks before they can return to homes affected by mudslide</h1>
      <h2>Some occupants in the Berry Hill Quarry area have been able to return but others must wait</h2>

      <p>The occupants of 19 homes which were evacuated after a <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/environment">mudslide</a> in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/mansfield">Mansfield</a> will not be able to return for around two weeks as the threat of "potential future falls" remains.</p>
      <p>Residents in 35 properties on Bank End Close and Stone Bank were evacuated on <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/mansfield-mudslide-triggered-torrential-rain-3517304">Thursday, November 7 as torrential rain caused a mudslide</a> along the cliff-face in Berry Hill Quarry.</p>
      <p>Since then, the occupants of 16 homes have been able to return home and Mansfield District Council has enlisted a specialist contractor, Fairhurst, to assess and survey the site.</p>
      <p>Debris has already begun to be cleared from the quarry area and an on-site team has also started removing trees overhanging the cliff and light vegetation.</p>
      <p>Another safety measure the team will put in place are concrete blocks to mitigate the effects of a similar incident occurring again.</p>

      <p>A statement from Mansfield District Council said: "Berry Hill Quarry is a complex site with various owners in occupation. In 2018 Mansfield District Council appointed Fairhurst, a specialist contractor, to assess the site.</p>
      <p>"Since their appointment Fairhurst has been actively assessing and surveying the slope.</p>
      <p>"The council has employed an on-site team to clear the debris that has fallen in the slip and to install additional safety measures to mitigate against potential future falls. This clearance work will take approximately two weeks to complete.</p>
      <p>"During this time, residents from 19 properties will remain evacuated as a matter of precaution. All affected residents have been able to return to their properties to collect essential items and the council has a 24-hour on-site security presence.</p>

      <p>Mansfield District Council has also asked for residents to keep clear of the site and ensure that children are supervised when in the area.</p>
      <p>One family <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/mansfield-family-left-living-out-3525789">told Nottinghamshire Live they are having to "live out of suitcases" in a hotel</a> because of the incident.</p>
      <p>The council's emergency communications team have been contacting evacuated residents on a daily basis to carry out welfare checks and inform them of any updates.</p>
