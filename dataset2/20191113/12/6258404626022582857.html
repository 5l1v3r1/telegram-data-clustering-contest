      <h1>Google Closes Book On Nexus 6P Shutdown Issues As Pixel 3 Complaints Pile Up</h1>

      <p>If you are still rocking a <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/heres-how-to-fix-google-nexus-6p-bootloop-of-death-errors">Nexus 6P handset</a>, good news, the shutdown issues some users had complained about are now officially fixed. A <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/google">Google</a> engineer says so, having finally marked the related issue tracker as "fixed" a little over four years after the phone launched. Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL owners who may be experiencing similar problems, on the other hand, are not so lucky.<br/><br/>It is a bit of a curious situation. The Nexus 6P, while a fantastic phone in its day (<a href="https://hothardware.com/reviews/nexus-6p-review">see our review</a> for a refresher), is somewhat underwhelming by today's standards, at least in terms of cutting edge hardware and features. That tends to happen when a phone turns four years old.<br/><br/>The Nexus 6P was also <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/nexus-6p-claims-open">not with its issues</a>. There were reports of the processor overheating, a battery bug causing unexpected shutdowns, and a bootloop issue. But those things are officially in the past, with a Google engineer finally updating the issue tracker's status to fixed.<br/><br/>According to <i>Android Police</i>, however, there is not actually a new update available. This may have been a simple record keeping measure. The issue tracker does not provide any further info, so who really knows what Google is thinking here.</p>
      <h3>Pixel 3 And Pixel 3 XL Shutdown Problems Persist</h3>
      <p>Unfortunately for some <a href="https://hothardware.com/reviews/google-pixel-3-android-smartphone-review">Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL</a> owners, some pesky issues remain. In particular, an apparent battery bug was brought up by a user in April.<br/><br/>"My Pixel 3 is about 3 months old. Recently when the battery levels gets to about 15 percent or 14 percent, it suddenly drains down to zero in like 15 seconds...like watching a count down as the percentage levels drops 1 percent each second. It doesn't happen when I have a particular app running, but just when the battery level gets to that 15 percent or 14 percent level. Otherwise the battery drains at a steady and reasonable rate, until it gets to the 15 percent or 14 percent level, then it counts down and drops to 0 percent and shuts down really quickly," the user stated on Google's <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/4021352">support forum</a>.<br/><br/>Over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/dpnx9h/3rd_pixel_3xl_that_dies_very_abruptly_under_20/">Reddit</a>, a more recent post (two weeks ago) complains about the same general thing, just with different percentages. Others have chimed to say they are experiencing the battery bug as well. The number of complaints don't seem to be on the same level of the Nexus 6P, but since April, they have started to pile up.<br/><br/>"Once it [Pixel 3] gets below the threshold I can watch it drop to 0 in a matter of seconds. This is the 3rd one I've had that does this. Sounds ridiculous but I'm convinced they all do this and not many have noticed," Reddit user BassCreative wrote with regards to a Pixel 3 XL abruptly dying once it reaches 20 percent battery life.<br/><br/>Whatever the cause, hopefully for those affected, it gets fixed before four years passes (and with an actual update).</p>
