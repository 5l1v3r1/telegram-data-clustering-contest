      <h1>Children are being sent to school with cold McDonald's as a packed lunch</h1>
      <h2>Others have turned up with half a sandwich a concerned teacher has revealed</h2>

      <p>Children are being sent to school with cold chicken nuggets and chips from McDonald's for a packed lunch, a teacher has revealed.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.lancs.live/news/lancashire-news/kids-being-sent-school-cold-17243629">Lancashire Live</a> reports that kids at a school in Blackburn were turning up with cold items from happy meals or chicken nuggets with the expectation that they'll be warmed up at school.</p>
      <p>A reception teacher at the school, who works with some of the most deprived children in the county, spoke to LancsLive and said that she has no choice but to send children for a school dinner when they turn up with inadequate lunches.</p>
      <p>And it's not just cold fast food that children are bringing to school.</p>
      <p>There have been instances of children attending with just half a sandwich to get them through the day.</p>

      <p>The reception teacher said: "They'll sometimes just have half a sandwich. I've also had children being sent in with chicken nuggets and an expectation that the kitchen will warm them up.</p>
      <p>"I said no and sent the child for a school dinner.</p>
      <p>"Parents sometimes send in cold items from a McDonald's Happy Meal for the children's lunches.</p>
      <p>"Equally you know the children who are starving because they are the first in the snack area eating the fruit and drinking the milk."</p>
      <p>More and more families in the county are turning to food banks to help them get by as they don't have the means to put enough food on the table.</p>
      <p>Food bank usage in Lancashire has hit a record high, with a total 23,960 emergency food parcels being issued to people in need across our county in 2018/19 - according to the Trussell Trust.</p>

      <p>It's therefore - but sadly - no surprise that pupils are turning up to school without a substantial meal.</p>
      <p>This month, we put into action what it was like to  <a href="https://www.lancs.live/news/lancashire-news/what-its-like-living-emergency-17160348">live off a food bank for three days</a>  to try and understand the reality of what people in Lancashire are going through.</p>
      <p>Blackburn with Darwen Council says it is committed to a new food strategy to tackle food poverty in the borough.</p>
      <p>Jayne Ivory, Director of Children's Services, said: “We know that we face great challenges and issues around poverty in Blackburn with Darwen and we, alongside our partners, continue to work very hard to tackle those inequalities that exist.</p>
      <p>"Some of the many factors that can contribute to children and families living in poverty are beyond our control but we are striving to make a difference in the areas that we can effect. Investment in the borough remains a priority with new businesses and jobs being created and public health investment to get help to people who need it.</p>

      <p>"We have committed to a new food strategy and launched a BwD Food Alliance in 2018, with the primary aim of tackling food poverty in the borough, and have supported an innovative scheme called the Blackburn and Darwen Summer Lunchbox Project, which aims to help struggling families by providing free packed lunches to children. We continue to work with our children, young people and families and our partners from all sectors who are also working hard to address these issues."</p>
