      <h1>GM design boss predicts cars will soon roll on 26-inch wheels</h1>
      <h2>Automakers will need to rethink brakes, suspensions and electric drivetrains</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T12:29:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 12:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.autoblog.com/bloggers/ronan-glon/" target="_blank">Ronan Glon</a></address>
      <p>As cars get bigger, so do the wheels that they ride on. This trend will continue in the coming years, according to <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/category/gm/">General Motors</a>, and we'll eventually reach a point where 20-inch alloys (which are twice as big as the steelies on an original Mini) will be considered comically and undesirably tiny.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the <a href="https://www.brembo.com/en/company/news/brembo-red-episode-2"><i>Brembo Red</i></a> podcast, General Motors design boss Michael Simcoe pointed out 18-inch wheels are considered small by 2019 standards. Rewind to 2009, and finding 18-inchers required walking into a luxury brand's showroom, or opening an <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/category/aftermarket/">aftermarket</a> company's catalog. Simcoe — who notably styled the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2015/01/13/chev-bolt-concept-questions-pricing-detroit-2015/">2015 Chevrolet Bolt concept</a> — believes this trend will continue.</p>
      <p>"We're headed towards 24- and 26-inch wheels," he <a href="http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/11/gm-design-chief-were-headed-towards-24-26-inch-wheels/">predicted</a>. The <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2018/10/18/2019-cadillac-escalade-esv-review/">Cadillac Escalade</a> (pictured) appears on the growing list of <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/research/">new cars</a> available with 22-inch wheels; the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/01/31/2019-audi-a7-drivers-notes-review-tastemaker/">second-generation Audi A7</a> is another. While adding four additional inches of metal sounds alarmingly donk-like, stylists will hopefully tweak the proportions of the wheel wells to accommodate such big alloys, so the end result will look cleaner and more coherent than merely dropping a 1980s <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/chevrolet/monte+carlo/">Chevrolet Monte Carlo</a> on 26s.</p>
      <p>Big wheels with an open design put the brakes out in the open, which creates an additional challenge for designers; they need to make the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/tag/brakes/">braking system</a> look good. This means it can't be too small, because nine-inch rotors would look silly behind 26-inch wheels, and they can't be too basic. Many <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/performance/">sports car</a> manufacturers give buyers the option of paying for painted brake calipers, and this practice will spread to other segments if 24- and 26-inch wheels begin appearing on options lists. Making closed wheels is a solution around this, and Simcoe explained the design will vary from car to car.</p>
      <p>The trend towards bigger wheels is one that <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/electric/">electric car</a> manufacturers will have a difficult time keeping up with. Broadly speaking, battery-powered models return better driving range when they're rolling on smaller wheels. The <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/tag/epa/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (<a href="http://www.epa.gov/">EPA</a>) <a href="https://www.roadandtrack.com/new-cars/a29741451/tesla-model-3-performance-range-20-inch-wheels/">carried out tests</a> which showed motorists who order a <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/tesla/model+3/">Tesla Model 3</a> with the optional 20-inch alloys lose 23 miles of range.</p>
      <p>Chassis engineers will have additional hurdles to clear, too, as larger wheels are often wrapped by low-profile tires, which compromise ride quality over rough terrain. But suspension systems are becoming more advanced, and automakers have shown the right amount of technology can even make big-wheeled cars extremely comfortable. After spending time in a <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/08/20/2020-lincoln-aviator-first-drive/">Lincoln Aviator</a> fitted with 22-inch wheels, <i>Autoblog</i> concluded it "soaked up the gnarled pavement around Napa Valley with no nervousness over smaller bumps, or impact harshness over bigger ones."</p>
