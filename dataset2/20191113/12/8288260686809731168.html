      <p>Talented local singers will be performing at Tamworth’s free Christmas lights switch-on.</p>

      <p>The group, founded by Kingsbury resident Katie Ashby, are known as UK’s premier wartime act having shot to fame on Britain’s Got Talent.</p>
      <p>The Juniors were set up in March this year and have already performed in venues such as the Union Chapel London and the Black Country Museum.</p>

      <p>“This is an incredibly popular event in our calendar of free entertainment for residents and visitors and it’s a lovely festive day out.</p>
      <p>“We are delighted to welcome the D-Day Darlings and Juniors, along with other local choirs, to help us start the festive season in style.</p>
      <p>“We are again inviting youngsters to really be a part of that with their families by joining the Christmas Lantern parade which also include this year 12 community groups that will design 12 large lanterns to be displayed at the Bandstand.</p>
      <p>“I’d encourage anyone interested to take part in the drop-in workshop being hosted in Ankerside Shopping Centre to not only secure a place in the parade, but also to take advantage of this free creative activity.”</p>
      <p>   </p>
      <p>The Christmas Lights Festival, sponsored by Ankerside Shopping Centre, starts at 1pm.</p>
      <p>Activities include fairground rides, live music and dance performances, walkabout characters, stilt walkers, free face painting, a new festive market and lantern parade.</p>
      <p>Entertainment will centre around the Touch FM stage in St Editha’s Square with a variety of live performances from 3pm.</p>
      <p>All children across the town are invited to take part in the lantern parade and help launch the festive season in style.</p>
      <p>This year the lantern parade will represent the 12 days of Christmas, with the involvement of 12 different community groups. These groups will be involved in making a new and bigger lantern design with each lantern themed with one of the 12-days of Christmas. Families and children are invited to join the project and make a smaller lantern that they can carry on the day of the parade.</p>
      <p>A final lantern-making workshop will take place in Ankerside Shopping Centre on Saturday, November 16, starting with sessions at 10am-12pm and 1pm-3pm. Youngsters are then invited to collect their lanterns at 3pm on November 24, from Unit 49 in the shopping centre.</p>
      <p>Creators of the 12 days of Christmas lanterns will have the opportunity to join in a sing-a-long on the main stage with Tamworth Pantomime Company and Touch FM before beginning the parade route which will pass through Ankerside to the Bandstand. The lanterns will then be joined together to make a Christmas tree shape, and the smaller children’s lanterns will form a Christmas present display.</p>
