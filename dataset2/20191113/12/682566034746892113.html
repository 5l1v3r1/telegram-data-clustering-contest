      <p>Sun City - South African golfer <b>Erik van Rooyen </b>believes International captain <b>Ernie Els </b>made the right decision in omitting him from December's <b>Presidents Cup</b> team.</p>
      <p>Els made his four wildcard picks last week and <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Golf/NedbankChallenge/ernie-feels-for-sa-duo-after-presidents-cup-snub-20191113">admitted on Tuesday</a> at Sun City that Van Rooyen had nearly made the cut for 12-man International team.</p>
      <p>Van Rooyen revealed he had spoken to Els, who is also competing in this week's <b>Nedbank Golf Challenge</b>, and believes he made the right call. </p>
      <p>"We spoke about it. I didn't get selected for the team, but Ernie and I had a very good chat," Van Rooyen told <b>Sport24</b> on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>"Look, I wouldn't want to be in his shoes because he had a very tough decision to make. There are a lot of very good players playing well at this moment. </p>
      <p>"I really believe he made the right choice for the team and I hope that we can go and win in Australia."</p>
      <p>This season has been a breakout on the European Tour for Van Rooyen as he romped to his first title at the Scandinavian Invitation in August.</p>
      <p>In<b> 27</b> events this year to date, Van Rooyen has <b>seven</b> missed cuts and has registered <b>eight </b>top 10 finishes.</p>
      <p>"It's been a very consistent year for me, I've got really good people around me... it's just a matter of practicing good habits and sticking to them," he said.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old, who is <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Golf/Rankings-Top-20-SA-players-20090316">currently 51st</a> in the world golf rankings, is eager to break into the Top 50.</p>
      <p>"The goal as a golfer is always to be in the top 50 because it means that you get into the big tournaments. That's where we want to play so it's a goal of mine. I guess I'm only one back, but you always keep pushing so hopefully we can keep going," he said.</p>
      <p>Van Rooyen admitted that 'Africa's Major' has become a special tournament for South African golfers.</p>
      <p>"It's my second time playing. It's a special tournament for us," he said.</p>
      <p>Van Rooyen will get his opening round at the Nedbank Golf Challenge underway on Thursday at <b>10:39</b> when he tees off alongside England duo Tommy Fleetwood and Matt Wallace.</p>
