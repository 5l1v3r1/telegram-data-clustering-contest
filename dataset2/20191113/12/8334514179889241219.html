      <p>BERLIN (Reuters) - The premier of the Brandenburg state that surrounds Berlin said on Wednesday any support for U.S. electric vehicle pioneer Tesla (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/TSLA.O">TSLA.O</a>) - which has said it will build its first European factory near Berlin - would be in accordance with EU rules.</p>
      <p>“We’re operating within the framework of the European Union’s state aid rules,” Dietmar Woidke told regional broadcaster rbb.</p>
      <p>“That applies to all European countries - that’s our framework. We’ll of course do our part to create good conditions for Tesla within these possibilities,” he added.</p>
      <p>Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said earlier on Wednesday that there had been no discussion yet of German government subsidies for Tesla.</p>
