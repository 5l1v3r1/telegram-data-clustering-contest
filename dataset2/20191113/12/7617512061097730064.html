      <p>VANCOUVER — Actor Bill Murray made a surprise appearance at Tuesday's Vancouver Canucks game — along with filmmaker Peter Farrelly, a fistful of 50-50 raffle tickets, and what appears to be a Hudson's Bay scarf.</p>

      <p>In one post Murray is seen holding a long sleeve of tickets for a raffle benefiting the Canucks for Kids Fund, which assists charities supporting children's education, health and wellness.</p>
      <p>In another, he's seen in the Canucks dressing room talking to players.</p>
      <p>His attire included a Chicago Blackhawks shirt, pageboy cap, and knitted scarf with the Hudson's Bay signature stripes.</p>
