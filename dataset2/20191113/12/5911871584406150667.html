      <h1>Preview Coldplay’s New Song “Daddy”</h1>

      <p>When Coldplay <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2062609/coldplay-orphans-arabesque/music/">confirmed the tracklist</a> for their new double album <i>Everyday Life</i>, the whole world was wondering what a Coldplay song called “Daddy” might sound like. And now we get to find out, at least in part.</p>
      <p>As they did with “Guns” last week, today Coldplay have shared a segment of “Daddy.” As much as I want to clown it, it’s actually one of those staggeringly pretty Coldplay songs that remind me why I sometimes <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/1669500/the-week-in-pop-its-time-we-all-agreed-that-coldplay-is-great/franchises/the-week-in-pop/">vigorously defend this band</a> despite their considerable bullshit. I am a sucker for the Coldplay tracks where Chris Martin is in his feelings (“<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/1667667/coldplay-magic/mp3s/">Magic</a>” remains their most underrated song), and this spectral piano ballad seems like it will fit the bill. Still, I will not blame you if this inspires you to tweet “run me over with a Zamboni zaddy” at Coldplay’s account or whatever. Dudes are asking for it.</p>
      <p>Besides this pair of teasers, Coldplay have shared three full advance tracks from <i>Everyday Life</i>: “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2062805/coldplay-orphans-video/video/">Orphans</a>,” “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2062609/coldplay-orphans-arabesque/music/">Arabesque</a>,” and the<br/><a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2063731/coldplay-everyday-life/music/">title track</a>. They’ll debut the whole album with <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2063670/coldplay-everyday-live-jordan-livestream-carrie-brownstein-fred-armisen/video/">a pair of livestreams from Jordan on release day</a>. Until then, here’s “Daddy” — which may run you over like a Zamboni, emotionally speaking — as well as last week’s “Guns” teaser.</p>
