        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/scuderia-ferrari">Ferrari</a> team principal Mattia Binotto has admitted the 2021 rule and regulation changes in Formula 1 will prove to be a good "starting point" in turning the sport around.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Before the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/grandsprix/united-states-grand-prix%20">USA Grand Prix</a>, the FIA and F1 introduced their new rules and regulations that will come into place after the 2020 F1 season, in a bid to try and make the competition more competitive across the grid.</p>
      <p>At the moment, <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mercedes-amg-f1-team%20">Mercedes</a>, Ferrari and <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/red-bull-racing%20">Red Bull</a> are the only teams who have a realistic chance of winning a race or recording a podium finish and F1 wants to put other teams in contention as well.</p>

      <p>Ferrari boss Binotto has praised the rule changes, saying it's the "right moment" to look for more sustainability in Formula 1, as quoted by <i>Crash.net</i>: <i>"We believe it is the right moment to look for a discontinuity, for our sport, it has to be sustainable, we are all aware of that.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>"We need to work hard as well in the future on a more sustainable, green, as well, sport. There is still much to work on, so if there is anything, I would avoid to say that it is locked down.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"I think this is still at a starting point where altogether now we need to collaborate, improve furthermore what is certainly a good set of regulations."</i>
