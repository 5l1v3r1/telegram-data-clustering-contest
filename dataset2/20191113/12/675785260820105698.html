      <p>Good Morning Britain presenter Piers Morgan hit out at The Apprentice star Joanna Jarjue, after she backed claims the patriotic song Rule Britannia should be banned.</p>
      <p>The debate took place on the show on Wednesday, after singer Lily Allen called for the banning of the song via her <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a>.</p>
      <p>She received a backlash from followers over the claims, with Piers also blasting the singer on the show today.</p>
      <p>But someone in support of the comments was Joanna, who commented that the lyrics were not appropriate.</p>
      <p>Piers wasn't happy with her claims though, defending it as reminder "we’re a great country".</p>

      <p>Joanne told him: "The song is written in the middle of the 1700s and that was when Britain was fully partaking in the slave trade.</p>
      <p>"So to have lyrics like rule Britannia and Britons will never be slaves while then fully participating in slavery, in 2019 I find that completely outdated."</p>
      <p>Piers asked: "So you would ban it too would you?"</p>

      <p>She replied: "Yeah I would, well banning it completely... if people want to kind of sing it in their own private homes..."</p>
      <p>A baffled Piers then asked her: "You’d ban it from the airwaves, we'd never play it in public again?</p>
      <p>"One of the greatest patriotic anthems this nation has ever had."</p>
      <p>Joanna said: "I don’t think we should be playing it and singing it on things like Remembrance," questioning why it was "patriotic".</p>
      <p>Outraged, Piers told her: "Because it stirs the soul and it reminds us of the fact we’re a great country."</p>

      <p>It's then that he was left calling her out again, when she admitted the song gave her a chill and said: "What I think is it reminds us of colonial rule.</p>
      <p>"When I listen to it especially on days like Remembrance Day I think it's a little bit insensitive, I think for the fallen soldiers, especially the ones from the Commonwealth."</p>
      <p>Piers hit back: "What, to celebrate them winning the World War? For risking and sacrificing their lives for us? It's insensitive?</p>
      <p>"You realise the ones that survived the war all sing that song proudly don't you?"</p>
