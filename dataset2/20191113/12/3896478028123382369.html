      <p>Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu commended the teams operating the Iron Dome missile defense system Wednesday, saying they had set a new standard by intercepting more than 90% of rockets launched from Gaza towards Israeli civlian population centers.</p>
      <p>Speaking at a special cabinet meeting in Jerusalem, Netanyahu said he believed Islamic Jihad was "beginning to get the message" that Israel would defend itself.</p>
