      <p>The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/economic-offences-wing">Economic Offences Wing </a>(EOW) of Mumbai Police has arrested an auditor in connection with the alleged Rs 4,355 crore scam at the Punjab &amp; Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank, an official said on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>This is the eighth arrest in the case.</p>
      <p>Anita Kirdat (35), a 'concorrent auditor' of the bank, was arrested on Tuesday, a senior police official said.</p>
      <p>Her responsibility was to ensure a "systematic and timely examination" of the bank's financial transactions, he said.</p>
      <p>Kirdat audited the bank's transactions monthly, but allegedly could not or did not point out irregularities in its processes.</p>
      <p>She was called for questioning and later arrested, the official said, adding that she was remanded in <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/eow">EOW </a>custody by a local court till November 18.</p>
      <p>On Monday, the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/eow">EOW </a>had arrested two statutory auditors, Jayesh Sanghani and Ketan Lakdawala, in connection with the scam. They are suspected to have played a key role in covering up the irregularities in the bank.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/eow">EOW </a>suspects a nexus between some of the accused and realty group HDIL, whose mammoth loan defaults are said to have caused a liquidity crisis at the bank, leading to appointment of administrator and restrictions on withdrawal of funds.</p>
      <p>Earlier, the EOW had arrested three top bank officials and two promoters of HDIL -- Rakesh and Sarang Wadhawan -- in the scam.</p>
