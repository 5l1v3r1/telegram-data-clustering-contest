      <p>Share prices of <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/refineries/mahanagargas/MG02">Mahanagar Gas</a> corrected more than half a percent after rising 2 percent in the early trade on November 13, but global brokerages remained bullish on the stock in view of the company's quarterly numbers.</p>
      <p>Citi has a buy rating on the stock due to reasonable valuations as the stake-sale overhang is behind it now.</p>
      <p>The global brokerage also raised the target price to Rs 1,135 from Rs 1,100, implying 17 percent upside from current levels, as it increased EPS estimates by 11-25 percent to factor in the lower tax rate.</p>

      <p>Volume growth slowed further even as margins remained high, it said.</p>
      <p>Jefferies also maintained a buy rating, but cut price target to Rs 1,180 from Rs 1,210, as margin trajectory remained robust in Q2FY20, though price cut may result in a margin compression of Rs 0.20-0.30/scm.</p>
      <p>"We built in Rs 9 per scm EBITDA margin in second half of FY20 (from Rs 8.60/scm earlier)," the brokerage said.</p>
      <p>Mahanagar Gas has reported a 59 percent sequential increase in second quarter profit at Rs 270.6 crore on revenue of Rs 783.6 crore, which increased 3.7 percent QoQ.</p>
      <p>At operating level, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) declined 1.2 percent sequentially to Rs 273.4 crore and margin contracted 170bps QoQ to 34.9 percent in Q2FY20.</p>
      <p>The stock was quoting at Rs 964.45, down Rs 4.95, or 0.51 percent, on the BSE at 1122 hours. It has rallied 23 percent in the last three months.</p>
