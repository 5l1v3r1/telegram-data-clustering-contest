      <p>The shopping complex in HSR Layout that was constructed by the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) wears a deserted look most of the times. Though the complex has space for 111 shops, not many are occupied <br/><br/>In terms of added value and entertainment, there is nothing to revel at about the facilities in this complex. The water fountain, which is supposed to be the main attraction for children, is dry and dirty. <br/><br/>The tiles on the staircase which leads to the first floor have come loose. Also, there is no facility for a lift at the complex. <br/><br/>“On the second floor, around 20 shops are vacant. Though some prospective tenants expressed their desire to open a shop they not evinced an interest to occupy them. Recently, a few tenants surrendered the shops to us since they were not able to bear the loss due to lack of footfall,’’ said a BDA revenue inspector.</p>
      <p>Not many visitors, especially young people, come to this complex as it is not on par with other shopping malls that have all the facilities, including multiplexes</p>
      <p>–K Ashok Kumar, BDA Revenue Inspector<br/><br/>BDA Revenue Officer K Ashok Kumar has attributed the lack of demand for the shops at the complex to commercialisation of HSR Layout. <br/><br/><br/>“Not many visitors, especially young people, come to this complex as it is not on par with other shopping malls that have all the facilities, including multiplexes. We have to bear the revenue loss since there is no other option,’’ he said. <br/><br/>A BDA revenue inspector said the civic authority has been losing around Rs 36 lakh revenue per annum due to the lack of demand for shops. <br/><br/><br/>Meanwhile, a rumour that the BDA is planning on demolishing the existing structure and constructing a huge mall, is doing the rounds.</p>
