      <p>Holiday Flowers? No, not the colorful ones that sit on the dining room table, waiting for the cat to nibble upon? These are ultra-gourmet cannabis flowers. The kind that we smoke for good health and good cheer for your holiday repast. And for considerate gift-giving!</p>
      <p>Here are a list of some, in my opinion of course, of the best holiday flowers *and concentrates* for all your holiday gifting pleasures, including yourself!</p>
      <p>I’ve tasted quite a few amazing cannabis flowers over the past year. Some of these exceeded my expectations, but for different reasons. Usually my tastes run towards outdoor grown cannabis, but after two amazing trips to Denver, my thoughts have changed just a little bit. Perhaps it was the “High Mountain Air” that changed my mind about indoor-grown cannabis? I’m not entirely sure, but the concentrates that I discovered in Colorado are most certainly, “World Class” and need to be spoken of.</p>
      <p>After the Hall of Flowers, I paid much closer attention to California-Grown!</p>
      <ol>
        <li><a href="http://www.kushmasters.com/"><b>Kush Masters</b></a>- Kush means the finest cannabis in my view and Kush Masters are consistently charming my palate (and lungs) with their ultra-gourmet approach to cannabis concentrates. This means dabbing. What is dabbing? Ask your teenager, that’s what they do to get stoned these days.</li>
        <li><a href="https://nattyrems.com/"><b>Natty Rems</b></a>- A Mile Higher than their competition, according to their marketing, Natty Rems is consistently higher than most. Dabbing is their pleasure, yet they also turn out micro amounts of extraordinary flowers. They also contribute some of the concentrates used in the <a href="https://madeinxiaolin.com/index-x.html"><b>Xiaolin Cannagars</b></a> that I’ve written about in prior articles on the finest cannagars.</li>
        <li><a href="https://williesreserve.com/"><b>Willie’s Reserve</b></a><b> </b>If you know who Willie Nelson is, then the search for Willie’s Reserve won’t be quite as difficult. You’ll already know that Willie Nelson appreciates the best cannabis that money can buy.</li>
        <li><a href="http://sunrisemountainfarms.com/"><b>Sunrise Mountain-Humboldt Craft Cannabis</b></a>. It’s all about the terroir at Sunrise Mountain. Outdoor grown in real soil. Does that make it better? I believe so and so will your taste buds. Unlike the ones we smoke, your taste buds make Sunrise Mountain Farms a memorable experience.</li>
        <li><a href="https://joshd.com/pages/og-kush-story"><b>Josh D. OG Kush</b></a>. Yes there is a backstory to Josh D. OG Kush. It stretches back to the very beginning of high-end, indoor grown cannabis. When speaking in superlatives, Josh D. is the humble one. The buds speak for themselves!</li>
        <li><a href="https://wonderbrett.com/genetics/"><b>Wonderbrett</b></a>. Premium Genetics means some of the best indoor grown cannabis that I’ve ever enjoyed. If you like to smoke cannabis that will really take you there, then Wonderbrett should be your go/to.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.casahumboldt.com/our-story"><b>Casa Humboldt</b></a>. Do you trust your medicine? Well, do you? I am consistently charmed by the often elusive Casa Humboldt. Why? It’s the miniscule amount that they grow, that’s why. True gourmet and Biodynamic, this cannabis may be a bit more difficult to find, but low THC and high CBD strains will help you get where you want to go. Even if its nowhere at all.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.flowkana.com/"><b>Flow Kana</b></a>. Some of the finest cannabis in the land is grown by family farmers in California and what Flow Kana does best is champion these small farms and offer them world class marketing and distribution throughout the state of California. I’m consistently charmed by Flow Kana.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.tradecraftfarms.com/"><b>Tradecraft Farms</b></a>. Organically grown indoor flower. This is gorgeous stuff and it sings of the quality of their own well-tended genetics. I’ve “waked and baked” with some of these luscious flowers and lost most of the next few hours. Completely gone!</li>
        <li><b>Brother David’s</b>. If you know Dr. Bronner’s Peppermint Soap, you’re already halfway there to Brother David’s. His family legacy is the soap that you’ve brushed your teeth with along with washing the skunk-smell off your dog. With alacrity I might add! Brother David’s is one of my favorites for a conversation with friends not yet met.</li>
        <li><a href="https://island.co/"><b>Island</b></a><b> </b>Cannabis without any overt labeling that says cannabis? Island has done that by removing the cannabis stigma from their packaging. Crisp and clean design with Southern California metaphors like the palm tree, cannabis this good can only be called, healing. I can’t explain why, it just works for me.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.agoldenstate.com/"><b>A Golden State</b></a>. Cannabis (absolutely of the finest kind) for recreation and relaxation. That says it all to me. Why? There is a lack of embellishment that makes A Golden State so desirable. No flashy advertising to confuse you. This is indoor grown cannabis that doesn’t act indoor grown.</li>
        <li><a href="https://getbloomfarms.com/products/"><b>Bloom Farms</b></a><b> </b>has a robust social ethos. They donate one meal to a person in need for every unit sold. That is not just lip service, this human-centric philosophy digs deep into what is really needed, not just empty statements. And Bloom is consistently charming my palate. A win/win.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.highrizeca.com/ourstory"><b>Highrize Hash-Infused Mini pre-rolls</b></a>. How could I do a list of the best and not include Highrize “friend-maker’s”? Why not indeed! Weighing in at .35 each, there is just enough cannabis and ice-water hash (15%) in each tiny joint to make my mouth water. <b><i>Rize High, Keep Grounded</i></b>.</li>
        <li><a href="http://nug.com/"><b>NUG</b></a>. The Highest Quality Single Source Cannabis and Concentrates.. I love Nug.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/warrenbobrow/2019/04/25/herb-of-life-cultivation-llc-promoting-positive-actions-over-stigmas/#3e6639f16dba"><b>The First Lady Of The West Coast</b></a>. True, I don’t know her real name, but her herbs are definitely world class. I smoked some and whoosh! They really work on my glaucoma.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.canndescent.com/"><b>Canndescent</b></a>. I love when my cannabis makes it easy for me. And none make it easier than Canndescent. They use descriptions of the results so you won’t enter the experience being confused. World Class Herb!</li>
        <li><a href="https://clearcannabisinc.com/"><b>Clear Cannabis Company</b></a>. Vertically integrated and Colorado located takes clear cannabis concentrates to a more profound place. Each puff charms your palate deeply and the overall effects are charming indeed. And the oils are crystal clear!</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.stoneroad.org/"><b>Stone Road. What do you do when an East Coast kid </b></a>moves to California to grow cannabis? You smoke it of course! Finest Kind!</li>
        <li><a href="https://sundae.school/"><b>Sundae School Cannabis</b></a>. I love Sundae School! Maybe because they are so smart? That has much to do with it, but I think my article that I wrote for <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/warrenbobrow/2019/03/15/sundae-school-luxury-cannabis-success-and-humility/#2160417950a0"><b>Forbes back in March says it all</b></a>. Love the herbs!</li>
        <li><a href="https://necann.com/news/speaker/elaine-keevin/%5C"><b>Excelsior Extracts</b></a>. You’ll know them when you try them, just dig a bit deeper. Consistently world-class craft cannabis, grown with abundant love!</li>
