      <h1>NASA Reverses Course After Giving Asteroid Nazi Name</h1>

      <h3>Ultima Oops</h3>
      <p>It’s the furthest celestial object we’ve ever visited with a spacecraft — asteroid <a href="https://futurism.com/tags/ultima-thule">Ultima Thule</a> has been fascinating scientists ever since NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft <a href="https://futurism.com/nasas-new-horizons-team-reveals-new-details-about-ultimate-thule">visited</a> it last winter.</p>
      <p>Now it’s back in the news for an embarrassing reason: NASA <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/far-far-away-in-the-sky-new-horizons-kuiper-belt-flyby-object-officially-named-arrokoth">renamed</a> the space rock on Tuesday after backlash about its old name’s Nazi connotations, <a href="https://phys.org/news/2019-11-nasa-renames-faraway-ice-world.html"><i>Agence France-Press</i> reports</a>.</p>
      <p>NASA’s new name for the asteroid is “Arrokoth,” meaning “sky” in the Native American Pohatan language.</p>
      <h3>Alt-Right Connotations</h3>
      <p>“Ultima Thule” originally referred to a mythical, far-away location in classical myths. But the name was later coopted by Nazi occultists who used it to refer to ancestral land of “Aryan” people, according to <i>AFP</i>. The name is still in use in alt-right circles and is even the name of a Swedish white-power rock group.</p>
      <p>“Historically that name was very positive and [we] realized afterwards that under certain contexts was negative,” astrophysicist Simon Porter who was part of Arrokoth’s discovery, told <i>AFP</i>.</p>
      <h3>Arrokoth</h3>
      <p>Conveniently, NASA didn’t mention any of that drama in <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/far-far-away-in-the-sky-new-horizons-kuiper-belt-flyby-object-officially-named-arrokoth">today’s statement</a> regarding the space rock’s new name.</p>
      <p>“The name ‘Arrokoth’ reflects the inspiration of looking to the skies and wondering about the stars and worlds beyond our own,” said Alan Stern, New Horizons principal investigator, in the statement.</p>
      <p>“We graciously accept this gift from the Powhatan people,” Lori Glaze, director of NASA’s Planetary Science Division added. “Bestowing the name Arrokoth signifies the strength and endurance of the indigenous Algonquian people of the Chesapeake region.”</p>
