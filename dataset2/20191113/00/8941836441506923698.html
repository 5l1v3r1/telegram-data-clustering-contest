      <h1>Tenn. school gives flyers advertising free birth control to 7-year-old</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T00:00:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/jessica-chasmar/" target="_blank">Jessica Chasmar</a></address>
      <p>A Tennessee public school district has admitted to making a mistake after flyers advertising free birth control were distributed to students as young as 7.</p>
      <p>Students at <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mary-hughes-school/">Mary Hughes School</a>, a K-8 school in Piney Flats, were given flyers earlier this month promoting a nearby event by the Remote Area Medical clinic providing various free medical services. The two-sided flyer advertised free dental, vision, and medical care on the front and free birth control “including implants, IUDs, pills, condoms, and more” on the back, WJHL-TV <a href="https://www.wjhl.com/news/local/sullivan-co-director-of-schools-distribution-of-birth-control-flyer-at-mary-hughes-was-oversight/">reported</a>.</p>
      <p>The Rev. Rich Penkoski, who said his 7-year-old son received the flyer, spoke out at last week’s school board meeting accusing the district of pushing a liberal, anti-Christian agenda.</p>

      <p>“Since when is it the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mary-hughes-school/">school</a>’s job to teach my son about birth control?” Mr. Penkoski asked, the Kingsport Times-News <a href="https://www.timesnews.net/Education/2019/11/07/RAM-birth-control-flier-upsets-parent-of-7-year-old-Piney-Flats-student">reported</a>. “I also can not help but notice abstinence is not on this list.”</p>
      <p>“This garbage in this flyer is anything but Christian values, and Christian families have a right to be upset about it,” added Tennessee Pastors Network President Dale Walker, WJHL-TV reported.</p>

      <p>Sullivan County Schools Director David Cox said the flyer’s “intention was good” but that the information about the free birth control should not have been included.</p>
      <p>“This, I would say, was an inadvertent distribution of that material, instead of just printing the one side,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mr. Cox said the district will review its materials distribution policy to make sure such an error doesn’t happen again.</p>
      <p>“The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mary-hughes-school/">school</a> regrets that the information was shared that was upsetting to some families,” he said.</p>

        <p>Mr. Penkoski said he isn’t buying the district’s explanation.</p>
        <p>“The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mary-hughes-school/">school</a> can say ‘inadvertent’ all they want, but that is like accidentally giving a child with a peanut allergy a peanut,” he <a href="https://www.christianpost.com/news/father-outraged-school-giving-7-year-old-son-flyer-promoting-free-condoms-birth-control.html">told</a> The Christian Post.</p>
