      <p>There’s a fundamental disconnect between the creative and “soft” skills that companies say they’re looking for when hiring employees, and the skills that job applicants include in their resumés, according to a new study by software giant Adobe. “Clearly there’s what we like to call a creativity gap in the needs that organizations are starting to realize,” said Mala Sharma, VP and general manager of Adobe Creative Cloud. “The way I net it out is from Adobe’s perspective, we have a conviction that creativity is the superpower for tomorrow’s workforce. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kai-Fu_Lee">(Long-time tech executive) Kai-fu Lee </a>last year stated how AI is going to replace 40 percent of the jobs in next 15 years, but the more secure jobs are the creative jobs. It’s how we understand the world, it’s how we problem solve.”</p>
      <p>The study – <a href="http://campusadobe.com/jobskills/"><i>Get Hired: The Importance of Creativity and Soft Skills </i></a><i>– </i>names five capabilities that were named in as many as 71 percent of 2 million job listings, but just as routinely omitted in most of the 2 million applications of people seeking work in 18 categories of largely high-growth jobs. </p>
      <p>The overlooked/undermentioned skills include, according to the study:</p>
      <p>• Complex Problem Solving</p>
      <p>• Creativity</p>
      <p>• Critical Thinking</p>
      <p>• People Management</p>
      <p>• Coordinating with Others</p>
      <p>Applicants tend to highlight more easily quantifiable technical skills in their resumes, like the ability to use certain software or to competently oversee a unit’s budget. Less easily described are those skills that help an employee thrive, especially as the job market shifts dramatically amid significant disruption from automation through artificial intelligence and other technologies.</p>
      <p>The skills were pulled from a 2016 list developed by the World Economic Forum, which surveyed senior Human Resources and strategy officers at major companies about the abilities needed for jobs in the coming decade.</p>

      <p>“The majority (of postings) ask for them, but in the majority of resumes, people don’t identify them as skills,” Sharma said. “As individuals, as we’re looking to get hired, we tend to focus on our qualifications or our educations.” </p>
      <p>The creative skills are being sought, and not found, in lots of jobs that aren’t necessarily associated with “creative” functions, in categories such as data science, nursing, social work, information security, construction, and marketing.</p>
      <p>The problem carries over into education, where the study suggests too little emphasis is placed on these same skills as part of training students for the jobs of the future.</p>
      <p>“Education and educators need to recognize that the jobs most at risk are the ones they’re focused on today,” said Sharma. “Beyond Photoshop and Premier and other (software programs from the company), we have spent a lot of time on how do you get storytelling mainstream.”</p>

      <p>Tacy Trowbridge, Adobe’s head of global education programs and a former English teacher, said the company has partnered with organizations such as NASA and the Royal Shakespeare Company. It also has an online education exchange that connects 700,000 teachers worldwide with resources on how to instill creative problem-solving in students.</p>
      <p>Taking a more project-based approach can often make a difference in teaching collaboration, communication, creative problem solving and more, Trowbridge said.</p>
      <p>“These use broader-based skills, where the answer may be unknown,” Trowbridge said. “Different teams may come up with different solutions. It does require that teachers think about the ways they go about assigning work in the classroom.”</p>
      <p>As the report emphasizes, job seekers shouldn’t just sprinkle those sought-after terms across their resumé.</p>
      <p>“Just seeing the words on one’s resumé isn't enough,” the study says. “Job seekers (who) share a narrative on how they have used these specific skills can help them stand out.”</p>
      <p>Not surprisingly, the Adobe executives emphasized their company’s products, such as the freemium apps <a href="https://spark.adobe.com/sp">Spark Post</a>, Spark Video and Spark Page, as well as the school-focused (and priced) Spark for Education, as tools to showcase those creative narratives.</p>
      <p>Sharma said one savvy job candidate she interviewed used Spark to send her a creative thank you note. That was clever and apt, but the soft skills to use those tools capably are what’s truly important.</p>
      <p>“Suddenly, it’s not about just using a tool,” Sharma said. “It’s about a mindset that indviduals need to inculcate, seeing what’s around the corner. All of that makes you valuable, the ability to bring new ideas to a problem. The tools can help you package it well, and packaging matters, narrative matters. But the stuff that makes your story compelling, it’s about collaboration, it’s about being able to communicate with people through debate and intellectual curiosity. It’s really important for individuals, at any point in their career, to spend time doing that.”</p>
