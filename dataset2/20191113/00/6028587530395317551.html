      <p>Jacare Souza might be the greatest middleweight in UFC history to never get a shot at the title at 185 pounds. Jacare’s inability to get the nod is a product of him losing at inopportune times, and being passed over by the UFC.</p>
      <p>He made his UFC debut in May 2013 and scored an impressive submission victory over Chris Camozzi. That win was the first in a 5-0 stint he enjoyed when he joined the promotion, and from March 2012 to April 2015 when submitted Camozzi again, Jacare won eight in a row.</p>
      <p>When you consider the reputation he brought to the UFC, it’s perplexing that he never got a title shot. His first loss was a controversial split-decision defeat to Yoel Romero, who has already fought for the title twice, and could be closing in on a third shot against Israel Adesanya in 2020.</p>
      <p>With a 9-4 record in the UFC, and closing in on his 40th birthday in December, Jacare is moving up to light heavyweight.</p>

      <p>His first challenge is Polish powerhouse Jan Blachowicz. In his last fight, Blachowicz destroyed and may have ended the career of former UFC Middleweight Champion Luke Rockhold.</p>
      <p>Blachowicz has struggled to get a title shot at light heavyweight, but he has compiled a far less impressive 7-5 record with the promotion. Prior to his win over Rockhold, he was stopped by former title challenger Thiago Santos.</p>
      <p>A win for Jacare or Blachowicz may not produce an immediate title shot, but it will push both veterans closer to that goal.</p>
