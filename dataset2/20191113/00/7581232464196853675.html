      <p>Deamidation of asparagine (Asn) is a spontaneous and non-enzymatic post-translational modification in proteins, playing a significant role in diseases related to aging such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. When this deamidation occurs, it results in isomeric aspartic acid (Asp) products.<br/><br/>To gain a better understanding of these products and the role they play, there are two methods that could be used to distinguish between isoAsp and Asp peptides: ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD) and electron-capture dissociation (ECD).<br/><br/>To find out more about which of these methods is most suitable, download this poster, which details:</p>
