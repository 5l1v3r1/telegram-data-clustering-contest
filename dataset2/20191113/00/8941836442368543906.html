      <h1>Dolphins will attend Colin Kaepernick workout</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T00:00:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/adam-zielonka/" target="_blank">Adam Zielonka</a></address>
      <p>The Miami Dolphins may be on an unexpected two-game winning streak, but they’re still one of the worst teams in football with no quarterback of the future on their roster. So it might not be a surprise that they’d do their due diligence on Colin Kaepernick.</p>
      <p>Dolphins coach Brian Flores <a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-dolphins/fl-sp-dolphins-colin-kaepernick-20191113-iquh4qkygzbkrm5ecmfcdvoucy-story.html">said</a> the team will send someone to Kaepernick’s workout Saturday in Atlanta.</p>
      <p>As of Wednesday afternoon, the Dolphins are the first team publicly known to be sending a representative to Kaepernick’s workout, which was announced Tuesday. The NFL arranged the workout rather than Kaepernick’s camp, ESPN reported.</p>
      <p>Kaepernick’s people also reportedly took issue with the fact that the NFL scheduled the workout for a Saturday, when many teams are traveling to their Sunday games, as opposed to a Tuesday, the day most NFL workouts generally take place.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old quarterback has not played in the league since 2016 when he began kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial injustice.</p>

        <p>The Dolphins’ quarterbacks are Ryan Fitzpatrick, who turns 37 this month, and second-year player Josh Rosen, who was acquired from Arizona during last year’s draft. Many believed Miami to be tanking this season to obtain an ideal draft position and draft a future franchise quarterback.</p>
