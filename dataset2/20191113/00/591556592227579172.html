      <p>Archer Materials continues to inch towards its goal of creating a room temperature quantum computer, as it announced on Wednesday it had assembled a three qubit array. <br/><br/>The company said it has placed three isloated qubits on a silicon wafer with metallic control electrodes being used for measurement. Archer has previously told ZDNet it conducts measurements by doing magnetic fields sweeps at microwave frequencies. <br/><br/>"The arrangement of the qubits was repeatable and reproducible, thereby allowing Archer to quickly build and test working prototypes of quantum information processing devices incorporating a number of qubits; individual qubits; or a combination of both, which is necessary to meet Archer's aim of building a chip for a practical quantum computer," the company said. <br/><br/>Executive chair of Archer, Dr Mohammad Choucair said building the array in less than a year meant the company was matching its development roadmap towards a minimum viable product. <br/><br/>"Today's quantum computers have at best a few dozen qubits, so it is important we unambiguously showed the possibility of scaling our chip qubits early in development," he said.</p>
      <p>"With a few-qubit array we can advance to the next stages of development, which involve quantum information measurement." <br/><br/>In August, the company said it had <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/australias-archer-details-first-stage-of-room-temp-quantum-chip-success/">assembled its first room-temperature quantum bit</a>.</p>
      <p>Archer is building chip prototypes at the Research and Prototype Foundry out of the University of Sydney's AU$150 million Sydney Nanoscience Hub. <br/><br/>Archer kicked off its <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/australias-archer-commences-room-temperature-quantum-chip-build/">12CQ project</a> to build a carbon-based quantum computer in April. <br/><br/>At the end of October, the company renamed itself from Archer Exploration to Archer Materials.</p>
