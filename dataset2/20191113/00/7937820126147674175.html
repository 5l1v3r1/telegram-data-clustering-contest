        <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03454-y">Sound-powered 3D display you can feel</a>
      </h3>
      <p>A prototype system uses sound to create <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03454-y">a moving 3D image that can be seen from any angle</a>. The volumetric display uses 256 tiny speakers to move a tiny foam bead so fast that it appears as a larger object floating in space. The same ultrasound speakers that create the image can also generate audio and tactile sensations.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The first spacecraft to release rovers on an asteroid is heading home. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency’s six-year mission has achieved a series of risky and unprecedented operations since Hayabusa2 arrived at Ryugu in June 2018. It was also the first to collect a sample of an asteroid’s subsurface material, after bombarding the surface to produce a crater. The probe is <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03514-3">due to arrive back on Earth at the end of 2020</a>, where a re-entry capsule will deliver its samples to the eager scientists on the ground.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Antibiotic-resistant infections kill one person in the United States every 15 minutes, according to a new report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The good news is that this marks a drop of nearly 30% since 2013, thanks to improvements in how hospitals respond to the spread of resistant germs. The bad news is that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2019/11/13/deadly-superbugs-pose-greater-threat-than-previously-estimated/?arc404=true">superbugs are on the rise outside hospitals, and drug resistance is spreading</a> more often between different germs. The CDC names five microbes as urgent threats, including drug-resistant gonorrhoea.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>People are already living on the edge in the Sahel region of Africa — world governments need to act now to keep the situation from worsening, say five researchers who study the ecologically vulnerable area in Africa. Their analyses of the probable impacts of rising population and climate change indicate <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03445-z">how to avoid an increase in conflict, terrorism, famines and mass displacement</a>. They call for investment in girls’ education, laws against child marriage, more access to contraception, better agricultural techniques and improved security in the region.</p>

She shares her first-hand knowledge of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03231-x">the difference made by simple things such as saying ‘welcome’</a>, seating a new colleague near other labmates and offering help with practical matters.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>It’s “too good to be true”, thought Fields medal-winning mathematician Terence Tao when he opened a letter from three physicists suggesting they had come up with a mathematical relationship so “short and simple — it should have been in textbooks already”. Stephen Parke, Xining Zhang and Peter Denton had found the broadly applicable formula while grappling with the complexities of neutrino behaviour.

      <h4>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h4>
      <h3>
        <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03488-2">“The ethics code and the rooibos agreement are small steps towards a bigger demand: that Indigenous people, especially those whose ancestors lost lives, land and livelihoods during more than a century of exploitation, are treated fairly and as equals.”</a>
      </h3>
      <p>There are lessons for all of us in South Africa’s rooibos-tea compensation agreement, says a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03488-2"><i>Nature </i></a><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03488-2">Editorial</a>.</p>
      <p>An algorithm that removes the distortion in underwater photos is useful for researchers who study coral reefs — and also produces <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sea-thru-brings-clarity-to-underwater-photos1/">stunningly beautiful (and accurate)</a> images.
