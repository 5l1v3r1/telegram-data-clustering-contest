      <p>PHOENIX — Arizona <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/paul-gosar/">Congressman Paul Gosar</a> appears to be signaling support for a conspiracy theory that Jeffrey Epstein did not kill himself while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.</p>
      <p>The Republican congressman sent 23 tweets Wednesday about the first public impeachment hearing examining President Donald Trump’s dealings with Ukraine. The first letter of each tweet spelled out “Epstein didn’t kill himself.”</p>
      <p>A New York medical examiner ruled Epstein’s jailhouse death a suicide. But conspiracy theories have persisted, fueled by Epstein’s links to princes, politicians and other famous and powerful people.</p>
      <p>It’s not clear if <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/paul-gosar/">Gosar</a> sent the tweets himself. His spokesman did not immediately respond to emailed questions.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/paul-gosar/">Gosar</a> is known for occasional antics and usual statements. He represents a staunchly conservative district in western Arizona.</p>
