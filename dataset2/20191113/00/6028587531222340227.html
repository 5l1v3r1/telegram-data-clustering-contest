      <h1>Nanoleaf Canvas Review: Smarter Lighting</h1>

      <p>Toronto’s Nanoleaf is a smart lighting company that pioneered a different approach to LED smart lights. Instead of a traditional lightbulb form factor, Nanoleaf developed flat panel lighting that interlocks together and can be wall-mounted. It’s smart lighting that does double duty as an art installation. Or as a custom lighting solution. The first version was the triangular <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradmoon/2017/12/18/gift-this-not-that-nanoleaf-aurora-vs-philips-hue/">Nanoleaf Aurora system</a> (now known as Nanoleaf Light Panels). Earlier this year, Nanoleaf released a new system called Canvas. It takes everything that was so cool about the original, but makes it considerably better. The square panels (called Light Squares) are easier to work with, they feature touch control and music sync is built-in.The <a href="https://us-shop.nanoleaf.me/collections/all-products/products/nanoleaf-canvas-smarter-kit">Nanoleaf Canvas</a> is even “smarter” modular smart lighting.</p>

        <b>Canvas Overview</b>
      </p>
      <p>Like the original Nanoleaf Light Panels, Canvas Light Squares connect together with a Linker — a small piece of plastic with printed circuitry that fits into the slots on two Light Squares to “Link” them, delivering power and providing a physical connection for the controller.</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Canvas Light Squares are connected using Linkers.<cite>Brad Moon</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>You can create patterns using the square tiles, which measure 6-inches on a side and about 1/4-inch in thickness. One Control Square acts as the physical controller for the installation. It has touch-enabled buttons that let you adjust brightness, shuffle between a series of stored light “scenes” and turn the power on or off. A single, small power adapter with an 8-foot cable connects to a free slot on any Light Square to power the system. A single Control Square can command up to 500 Light Squares, and one power supply is needed for every 25 Light Squares.</p>
      <p>While installations maxed out at 30 panels for the original Nanoleaf Light Panels, the Canvas system is designed to support massive installations.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>I found the Canvas Light Squares offer colors that are a little more intense than those the Light Panels are capable of, but where the triangular Light Panel is a single consistent surface, the Light Squares show four distinct quadrants (all the same color). It has the effect of making them look even more “detailed” as each Light Square presents itself as four smaller squares. </p>

        <figcaption>Arrange the Light Squares to form any pattern.<cite>Brad Moon</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Each Light Square supports touch input, and the results there can range from rippling colors to being able to use the panels to play a touch-based game like “Simon.” In addition, the Nanoleaf Canvas has an integrated audio sensor and you can choose to have the system pulse to the beat of your music. This feature is really cool if you like listening to music...</p>
      <p>The initial fun of the Nanoleaf Canvas system is arranging Light Squares into interesting patterns. From there, you can wall-mount your creation using the included two-way tape.</p>

        <figcaption>The Nanoleaf app is packed with features, including the ability to create or download new light ... [+] scenes.<cite>Screen capture by Brad Moon</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Download the free Nanoleaf Smarter Series app to control the lighting system and to set it up on your Wi-Fi network.</p>
      <p>You can browse and download from a selection of free scenes including Color (slow animation in various themes and patterns) , Rythym (pulse with music) and Interactive options (games). There is a lot to choose from here, including seasonal offerings. You can also use the Canvas Light Square for traditional lighting, with different white temperatures. You can use the app to create your own scenes, set schedules, experiment with virtual layouts and other features.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Compatible With Smart Home Platforms and Personal Assistants</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Nanoleaf Canvas is a smart lighting system and that means it plays well with popular smart home platforms and personal assistants. Canvas is compatible with Apple HomeKit, Google Home, Siri, Google Assistant and Alexa. It also supports IFTTT (If This, Then That). I tested with Siri voice control and Canvas responded perfectly to voice commands using my iPhone, to turn on and off, change brightness levels, and change scenes.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What You Get in a Nanoleaf Canvas Smarter Kit </b>
      </p>
      <p>The starting point to a Nanoleaf Canvas installation is the “Smarter Kit,” which is what I used for this review. The box includes everything needed for a Canvas installation: 8 Light Squares, 1 Control Square, 9 Linkers, 28 pieces of double-sided adhesive foam mounting tape and a power supply. The Nanoleaf Smarter Series app is available for iOS and Android, at no charge.</p>

      <p>Priced at $199.99 the kit is available nationally at retailers including Home Depot. </p>
      <p>You can expand from the Smarter Kit if you want a more elaborate installation. Additional Canvas Light Squares are available in <a href="https://us-shop.nanoleaf.me/collections/all-products/products/nanoleaf-canvas-expansion-pack?variant=29203136053363">expansion packs</a> (4-Squares $79.99 and 25-Squares $499.99). Nanoleaf also offers accessories such as Flex Linkers (for corners), additional power supplies (needed for every 25 additional Light Squares), and screw mount kits for ceiling and textured wall installations. If you want to get funky with the controls instead of using the app or touch, Nanoleaf also makes a remote that looks like a giant, glowing, 12-sided die (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradmoon/2018/06/29/nanoleaf-remote-review-no-buttons-12-sides-big-cool-factor/">I reviewed it last year</a>).</p>

      <p>I was a big fan of the Nanoleaf Light Panels, and the new Nanoleaf Canvas system keeps the best features of the original, while offering a series of significant improvements. If you already own the original, the Canvas isn’t compatible (at least you can’t connect panels interchangeably), but the same app controls it and most of the same light scenes are available — you’ll have to start with a new installation, but if you liked Light Panels, you’ll love the Canvas Light Squares. And if you haven’t had a chance to check out Nanoleaf’s offerings in the past, the Nanoleaf Canvas Smarter Kit is a great way to enjoy the best of smart lighting while also customizing your home decor.</p>
      <p>Disclosure: Home Depot provided a Nanoleaf Canvas Smarter Kit for evaluation but had no input into this review.</p>
