      <p>NEW YORK (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/google/">Google</a> plans offer checking accounts run by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/citigroup/">Citigroup</a> and a credit union, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal.</p>
      <p>Big tech companies have been pushing into other arenas such as finance and health care to gain more access to consumer data. The push comes at a time when regulators are looking into privacy practices by firms including <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/google/">Google</a> and Facebook so the deals are likely to be scrutinized.</p>
      <p>The project is expected to launch next year, a <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/google/">Google</a> executive told The Journal. The financial institutions’ brands, not <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/google/">Google</a>’s, will front the accounts.</p>
