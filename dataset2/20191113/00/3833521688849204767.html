      <p>MONTREAL - Bouclair Inc. says it plans to file for bankruptcy as part of a plan to be acquired by a new investor group that includes its chief executive.</p>
      <p>The Montreal-based home-decor retailer says it and Bouclair International filed notices of intention to make a proposal under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.</p>
      <p>The move is part of a proposed transaction through a court-supervised process that is expected to close before the end of the year.</p>
      <p>The transaction will see Alston Investments Inc. acquire a substantial portion of Bouclair's assets and maintain more than 60 of its shops, its Pointe-Claire, Que., head office, and much of its employee base.</p>
      <p>Alston, which announced the acquisition offer Tuesday, is made up of Canadian investors, including Bouclair's CEO Peter Goldberg.</p>
      <p>The company says it will close some of its stores, and will seek an order authorizing a liquidation process for the assets in certain stores that will not be part of the transaction.</p>
